## Description
CRYSTALLINE CEPHALOSPORIN ANTIBIOTICS This invention relates to cephalosporin antibiotics in crystalline form. US A 4464367 discloses the compound of the formulaEMI1.1 Formula 2 i.e. 7 2 2 amino 1,3 thiazol 4 yl 2 methoxyimino acetamido 3 fur 2 ylcarbonyl thiomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid or, by alternative nomenclature, 7 2 2 amino 4 thiazolyl 2 methoxyimino acetamido 3 2 furanyl carbonylthiomethyl 8 oxo 5 thia 1 azabicyclo 4.2.0 oct 2 ene 1 carboxylic acid, and its alkaline metal, alkaline earth metal and amine salts of the carboxylic acid group , and easily hydrolysable esters.The cephalosporin free acid of the given formula is now known by the generic name Ceftiofur, in France. Ceftiofur and the derivatives disclosed inUS A 4464367 are somewhat unstable, chemically. They are obtained as amorphous compounds which are difficult to purify. Novel compounds according to the present invention are Ceftiofur hydrochloride and Ceftiofur hydrobromide, in crystalline form. These crystalline salts are easier to isolate, purify and handle than Ceftiofur and its known derivatives. The novel compounds have the formulaEMI1.2 Formula 1 wherein X is C1 or Br. The novel salts may be prepared by the steps of a heating a solution of 7 2 2 N tritylamino1,3 thiazol 4 yl 2 methoxyimino acetamido 3 fur 2 ylcarbonyl thiomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid in a polar organic solvent and water with an at least stoichiometric equivalent of hydrogen chloride or hydrogen bromide b reducing the concentration of the polar organic solvent in the aqueous phase, to form the crystalline hydrohalide salt c separating the crystalline hydrohalide salt from the slurry and d washing the separated salt with water and a polar organic solvent, and drying the salt. In step a , the N trityl compound of the formulaEMI2.1 Formula 3 is treated with a solution containing a water miscible organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, methyl ethyl ketone or, preferably, acetone, plus water and the hydrogen halide. In step b , a non polar, water immiscible organic liquid, e.g. toluene or heptane, may be added to reduce the concentration of the polar organic solvent, e.g. to extract acetone, and to take up the trityl alcohol by product. Some of the water miscible organic solvent may be separated by distillation or by other physical or chemical means. Water and hydrogen halide may be added to enhance crystal salt formation. Alternatively, the novel salts can be prepared fromCeftiofur free acid or from an alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or amine salt thereof, e.g. the sodium carboxylate salt, by treatment in an aqueous organic liquid mixture, e.g. of acetone and water, with the hydrogen halide. The desired salt is then precipitated, either by removing some of the organic liquid or by removing the aqueous phase from the mixture. The crystalline precipitate can be recovered by known means. As a matter of economics, the hydrochloride salt of the invention is generally preferred. The crystalline hydrochloride salt has the following X ray powder diffraction pattern when crystallised from water acetone Interplanar d spacings intensity A relative 18.4 44.2 12.4 73.1 8.26 50.0 7.82 100.0 7.69 17.9 6.19 48.1 5.86 32.1 5.21 23.1 5.12 40.4 4.74 30.1 4.37 21.8 tri.23 13.5 3.98 26.9 3.91 35.9 3.81 17.9 3.30 14.1 3.01 12.8 2.88 14.1 Peaks with relative intensity equal to or less than 10 are not reported. The salt may contain 0.5 to 2.0 equivalents of hydrogen chloride, but most orten around one equivalent of HC1. The crystalline hydrochloride salt can be crystallized in a solvent consisting of a polar organic solvent or water or a mixture of such solvents. A typical crystallization involves slurrying one gram free acid 2 in 20 ml. of 3S V V water in acetone at 25or. At least two equivalents of hydrogen chloride are added to dissolve the free acid and crystallize the hydrochloride salt. The crystals can be separated by filtration and washed to remove the remaining mother liquid. The crystals may then be dried under vacuum at elevated temperature.The yields of hydrochloride salt are generally 60 to 95 depending on the solvent and the purity of the free acid 2 . This salt may contain 0.5 to 7 of water or other solvents usually 12 31X . Other impurities are usually reduced to 1 or less. A recrystallization may be performed by either a forming and isolating the free acid 2 and then reforming the hydrochloride salt 1 or b by dissolving the hydrochloride salt 1 in aqueous organic solvent usually containing one or more equivalents of HC1 and then removing the organic solvent by distillation, extraction, or other method of separation. The free acid 2 or other pharmaceutically acceptable salts such as 4 can be made from the purified hydrochloride salt. Other crystallization solvents include acetonitrile, tetrahydrofran, methyl ethyl ketone and water. The hydrobromide salt can be made by a similar procedure. The hydrochloride salt can also be made directly from the tritylprotected cephalosporin. For example, the crude trityl cephalosporin is slurried in 37 V V water in acetone. Three equivalents of hydrogen chloride are added and the solution is refluxed until detritylation is complete. Toluene or equivalent non polar water immiscible organic liquid solvent is added while stirring. The mixture is allowed to separate and the aqueous phase is removed and cooled to crystallize the hydrochloride salt. See Example 4 hereinbelow. In aqueous buffer solutions the sodium salt Formula 4 is more stable as the pH decreases. In hydrochloric acid at pH values equal to or lower than 2.8 the sodium salt 4 is converted to the hydrochloride salt 1 which exhibits better shelf stability when it is separated, washed and dried. The new hydrochloride salt 1 has lower aqueous solubility than the sodium salt 4 and the free acid 2 , and is better adapted for making controlled release pharmaceutical dosage formulations such as oral and parenteral suspensions, suppository and tablet dosage forms. The new hydrochloride salt 1 produces acceptable pharmaceutical dispersions in water for injection and in pharmaceutical vegetable oils. Due to this property, the hydrochloride salt 1 can be formulated into extemporaneous liquid and drug powder mixed just prior to administration liquid suspensions by the addition of an aqueous or an oily vehicle to the hydrochloride salt I powder, just prior to dosing the patient. Oral and subcutaneous studies in mice with aqueous and oil dispersions of both the hydrochloride 1 and the sodium salt 4 indicate that the hydrochloride 1 is bioequivalent to the sodium salt 4 . However, we have found that the crystalline hydrochloride salt 1 can be made in more pure form, is easier and is less expensive to manufacture than the sodium salt 4 . Further, since the hydrochloride 1 has more limited solubility in water various controlled release pharmaceutical dosage formulations can be made with it 1 that are not readily adaptable to the sodium salt 4 . Due to the lower solubility of the ceftiofur hydrochloride, its rate of dissolution is slower. As a result absorption is less, and thus various controlled release formulation s can be formulated. The controlled release parenteral suspension see Examples 12 and 14 below can be given once every 2 to 5 days as opposed to being given daily with other formulations. The invention, how to make it and how to use it are further exemplified by the following detailed examples which are not intended to be limiting. In these examples, povidone is a known form of polyvinylpyrrolidone, used in pharmacy. Quatresin is a brand name for myristyl gamma picolinium chloride. The corn oil glycerol monostearate gel and cottonseed oil glycerol monostearate gel materials are described in U.S.Patent No. 4,034,099. Suppocire refers to a brand name of a series of mixtures of saturated glycerides of C10 to C1g fatty acids which are known in pharmacy as excipients for use in various suppository and other pharmaceutical formulations and are described in product bulletins of Gatte fosse Establissment SA., Paris, France, 39 Avenue Edouard Vaillant Suppocire AM is said to have a melting point of 350C. to 36.50C. PEG 400 and PEG8000 are well known pharmaceutical excipient forms based upon polyethylene glycol. Carnauba wax is the pharmaceutical form thereof defined in the National Formulary NF . The improved hydrohalide salt forming and purification process of this invention is adaptable to and can be used with a proposed large scale process for making the cephalosporin compound itself. The N trityl cephalosporin derivative 3 which is the preferred starting material is prepared by acylation of the corresponding 7amino precursor 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid nucleus compound with theN trityl 2 amino 1 , 3 thiazol 4 yl 2 methoxyimino aceti c acid by acylation methods well known to those skilled in the cephalosporin production art. For example, the procedure described in U.S. Patent 4,464,367 for the preparation of 3 with N hydroxybenzotriazole and N,N dicyclo hexylcarbodlilnide can be used. Alternately, the corresponding acid chloride can be prepared and used as described in the Journal ofAntibiotics, 36, 180 1983 . According to the process of this invention in step a the N trityl cephalosporin 3 see STRUCTURE SHEET is treated with a solution mixture of a polar solvent e.g., acetone and water in proportions ranging from about 200 to 100 parts V V of polar solvent per tOO parts of water in an amount to obtain a workable slurry. Sufficient hydrogen halide e.g., hydrogen chloride is then added. The hydrogen halide can be added in an amount which is at least stoichiometrically equivalent to the trityl amino compound 3 . For efficiency reasons, we prefer to add about three equivalents of hydrogen halide per equivalent of the trityl protected cephalosporin 3 . The hydrogen halide can be added as a gas, below the liquid surface, or as a hydrohalic acid solution in water. In step b , the acidified mixture from step a is heated to a temperature, generally above 450C., and for a time sufficient to effect detritylation of the cephalosporin. 3 and to form the cephalosporin hydrohalide salt 1 . We have found that reflux of the mixture, which occurs in our mixtures at about 560C., for about one hour is sufficient to effect the detritylation, without destruction of the cephalosporin. In step c of the process the detritylated cephalosporin hydrohalide mixture is washed with a non polar non water miscible organic liquid which liquid takes up the trityl alcohol by product and some of the acetone in the mixture. Examples of useful liquids for this purpose include liquid aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons such as chlorinated benzene, toluene and xylene, and chlorinated alkanes such as methylene chloride, dichloroethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, as well as C2 toC3 alkyl acetate and propionate esters such as ethyl acetate, propyl acetate and liquid C6 to C10 alkanes such as hexanes, heptane, octane, nonane and decane, and liquid C5 to C7 cycloalkanes such as cyclopentane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane, and mixtures, including commercial mixtures of such liquids.Toluene and or heptane are preferred. Optionally, extra water and acid may also be added at this point. The hydrohalic acid addition is optional because it depends upon the amount of hydrogen halide already present in the mixture. The added hydrogen halide at this stage gives shorter cyrstallization times. In step d the crystalline cephalosporin hydrohalide salt 1 is separated from the liquid phase by known means such as by filtration or centrifugation procedures, and in step e the separated crystalline cephalosporin hydrohalide salt I is washed one or more times with water and water miscible organic solvent, e.g., acetone, or mixtures thereof, and then dried step f , for example, by spreading the crystalline salt in trays, and drying the salt in a vacuum oven at 1i00 600C. for a time sufficient to remove any adhering volatile liquids therefrom. The compounds of Formula 1 herein are useful as the active antibiotic drug compound in pharmaceutical dosage forms for treating valuable mammalian animals and humans to treat bacterial infections in that valuable animal or human. Presently it is contemplated that this compound will be especially useful as a veterinary antibiotic drug to treat valuable animals such as cattle, horses, goats, dogs and cats to fight the effects or bacterial infections caused by organisms such as Pasturella hemolitica, Salmonella typhimurium, E. coli Staphylococcus, aureus, and the like, some of which are commonly associated with shipping fever in animals. The term dosage unit form as used in this specification and in the claims refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for mammalian subjects, each unit containing as the essential active ingredient a predetermined quantity of a compound of this invention with the required pharmaceutical means which adapt said ingredient for systemic administration. The specification for the novel dosage unit forms of this invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the physical characteristics of the essential active ingredient and the particular effect to be achieved in view of the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an essential active material for beneficial effects in humans and animals as disclosed in detail in this specification. Examples of suitable dosage unit forms in accordance with this invention are tablets, capsules, orally administered liquid preparations in suitable liquid vehicles, sterile preparations in suitable liquid vehicles for intramuscular and intravenous administration, suppositories and sterile dry preparations for the extemporaneous preparation mixing just prior to administration of sterile injectable preparations in a suitable liquid vehicle. Suitable solid diluents or carriers for the solid oral pharmaceutical dosage unit forms are selected from the group consisting of lipids, carbohydrates, proteins and mineral solids, for example, starch, sucrose, lactose, kaolin, dicalcium phosphate, gelatin, acacia, corn syrup, corn starch, talc and the like.Capsules, both hard and soft, are filled with compositions of this antibiotic active ingredient in combination with suitable diluents and excipients, for example, edible oils, talc, calcium carbonate and the like and also calcium stearate. Liquid preparations for oral administration are prepared in water or aqueous vehicles which advantageously contain suspending agents, for example, methylcellulose, alginates, tragacanth, pectin, kelgin, carragenan, acacia, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, and the like, to increase the viscosity of the composition. In the case of injectable forms, the injectable formulation must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability exists.Such preparations must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage, and ordinarily contain in addition to the principal solvent or suspending liquid, preservatives in the nature of bacteriostatic and fungistatic agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, benzyl alcohol, benzoic acid, phenol, thimerosal, and the like to preserve the composition against microorganisms. In many cases, it is preferable to include osmotically active agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride in isotonic concentrations. Carriers and vehicles include vegetable oils, dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamaide, ethyl lactate, ethyl carbonate, isopropyl myristate, ethanol, polyols, for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like.Any solid preparations far subsequent extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable preparations are sterilized, by exposure to steam, cobalt 60 irradiation, or by exposure to a sterilizing gas, for example, ethylene oxide.The aforesaid carriers, vehicles, diluents, surfactants, excipients, preservatives, isotonic agents and the like constitute the pharmaceutical means which adapt the preparations for systemic administration. In these pharmaceutical compositions it may be desirable to include a viscosity increasing agent such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose sodium CMC . Other suitable viscosity increasing agents can be substituted for sodium CMC. The pharmaceutical dosage unit forms of the compounds of this invention are prepared in accordance with the preceding general description to provide from about 1 mg. to about 500 mg. of the essential active ingredient per dosage unit form, which as aforesaid may be in the form of a semi solid or solid, topical, oral or rectal preparation, a liquid oral preparation, an injectable preparation including liquid preparations and solid dry preparations for extemporaneous reconstitution to a liquid injectable preparation. The amount of the essential active ingredient provided in the pharmaceutical dosage unit forms is that amount sufficient to obtain antibiotic effects within the aforesaid effective non toxic range.Expressed otherwise, when used systemically, an amount of the essential active ingredient is provided to a recipient within a range from about 0.2 mg. kg. to about 10 mg. kg. of body weight of the recipient. Preferred dosages for most applications are 0.2 mg. kg. to 5.0 mg. kg. of body weight. In a topical semi solid ointment formulation the concentration of the active ingredient may be 1 201, preferably 5 10 in a carrier, such as a pharmaceutical cream base. The useful pharmaceutical dosage unit forms of these compounds in pharmaceutical formulations are preferably adapted for systemic administration to obtain antibiotic effects comprising an effective, non toxic amount of the Formula 1 salt. Further, the invention relates to methods of obtaining antibiotic effects in mammals, for example, humans and valuable warm blooded animals such as dogs, cats, horses, and other commercially valuable animals, by administering systemically to the mammals the aforesaid pharmaceutical dosage units forms supplying an effective, non toxic amount for antibiotic effects. The invention is further illustrated by the following detailed examples.Example 1 A slurry of 0.7 g. of ceftiofur as its free acid in 7 ml. of acetone and 0.35 ml. of water is made up. To this slurry is added 0.24 ml. of 37.7 hydrochloric acid solution. The resulting acidified slurry becomes a solution within a minute, and then crystallization of the ceftiofur hydrochloride salt begins within 2 or 3 minutes.An additional 7 ml. of acetone are added to thin the slurry. The slurry mixture is stirred for 10 minutes at 200C. and then filtered and the filtered hydrochloride salt crystals are washed with acetone.The ceftiofur hydrochloride salt crystals are then dried for 16 hours in a vacuum oven. The yield of the ceftiofur hydrochloride salt crystals is 0.63 g., for an 84 chemical yield.Example 2 A slurry of 0.7 g. of ceftiofur free acid in 11.8 ml. of acetone and 6.9 ml. of water is made up. To this slurry there is added 0.27 ml. of 37.7 hydrochloric acid solution, and the mixture is warmed to 550C. The ceftiofur free acid is in solution. To this warmed solution a 550C. temperature mixture of 13.2 ml. or toluene and 3.2 ml. of water is added while stirring. The liquid phases are allowed to separate, and the upper organic layer is discarded. The lower aqueous layer is cooled to 150C. after seeding with previous crystalline ceftiofur hydrochloride, and allowed to stand for two hours. After standing, the mixture is filtered to separate the crystalline ceftiofur hydrochloride salt from the liquid mother liquor. The filtered salt crystals are washed with 4 ml. of 20 acetone in water V V mixture.Then the salt crystals are washed with 10 ml. or water. The washed ceftiofur hydrochloride salt crystals are dried for 1 6 hours in a vacuum oven at 40 C. The yield of ceftiofur hydrochloride salt crystals is 0.50 g. for a 67 chemical yield.Example 3 Detritylation of N trityl ceftiofur and Crystallization of Ceftiofur Hydrochloride Salt Using Toluene Extraction of Acetone To a three necked, round bottom 250 ml. flask is charged 14.8 g. or N tritylated ceftiofur free acid 3 , 91 ml. of acetone, 2.4 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 91 ml. of water. This resulting mixture is heated to reflux. Then 10 ml. more of acetone is added to dissolve a precipitate, presumably trityl alcohol. While the mixture is still hot 550C. , 60 ml. of toluene is added to remove trityl alcohol and to decrease the concentration of acetone in the aqueous phase. The resulting mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and the liquid layers are separated. The organic liquid phase is washed with a mixture of 25 ml. of water and 10 ml. of acetone. The organic layer is 120 ml. total volume. The separated aqueous layer is washed with 30 ml. of toluene, and then the toluene and aqueous phases are separated to give a 45 ml. total volume toluene plus inter phase. The aqueous layer about 140 to 150 ml. is stirred with a magnetic stir bar for three hours, and then cooled to 5 C. and filtered to separate the ceftiofur hydrochloride salt crystals which form.This crystalline filtered salt product is washed with 15 ml. of a mixture consisting of 10 ml. of water and 5 ml. of acetone. The washed ceftiofur hydrochloride crystalline product, 4.63 g., is dried at 500C. A second crop can be obtained by filtering mother liquor filtrate.The resulting ceftiofur hydrochloride crystalline product, 1.46 g. is washed with water. The total yield is 88.1 .Example 4 A mixture of 96 ml. acetone, 55 ml. water and 2.93 ml. 37.7 HCl in water solution are added to about 10.0 gm. trityl cephalosporin 3 and refluxed about 580C. for one hour to affect detritylation. A mixture of 18 ml. heptane and 4.5 ml. acetone is added to the above solution. The combined liquids are transferred to a separatory tunnel and allowed to separate. The lower layer aqueous is transferred to another separatory funnel and 18 ml. of heptane and 4.5 ml. of acetone are added to the aqueous phase in the second separatory funnel.The combined liquids are contacted and allowed to separate as before.The lower phase aqueous is distilled atmospherically to a temperature of 67 C. which reduces the concentration of acetone to about 15 .Before cooling to 150C., 2.93 ml. of 37.7 HCl solution are added.The cephalosporin HCl salt 1 begins crystallizing between 500C. and 600C. The crystals are filtered and washed with 20 ml. of 10 acetone in water to remove any adhering filtrate. The resulting washed, filtered solids are then washed with water and dried in a vacuum oven at 650C. to give 6.87 g. of product.Example 5 Oral Suspension One thousand cc. of an aqueous suspension for oral use, containing in each 5 oo. dose 5 to 300 mg. of crystalline ceftiofur hydrochloride is prepared from the following types of and amounts of ingredients.Ceftiofur hydrochloride crystalline 5 to 300 gms.Benzoic Acid or Sorbic Acid 1 gm.Sucrose 650 gms.Sodium Carboxymethylcellulose, Low Viscosity 1 to 20 gms.Flavors e.g., USP cherry, orange q.s.
