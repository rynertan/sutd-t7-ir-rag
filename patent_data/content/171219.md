# Method and apparatus for indicating the contact structure of an electromagnetic contactor on the housing thereof using laser light.

## Abstract
The contact structure of a contactor 1 to be marked with terminal numbers or the like is detected by a checking device 30. Based on the results of checking, a mask selector 50 se lects a suitable mask 51 and positions it in the optical path of a laser 60. Laser light is shone through the mask onto the hous ing 2 of the contactor. The laser light which passes through the mask and strikes the housing produces discoloration of the housing, and extremely clear terminal numbers, name plates, or other information in the form of characters, symbols, or shapes can be marked on the housing with the laser light. In ad dition to determining the contact structure, the checking device determines whether the contacts are faulty.
