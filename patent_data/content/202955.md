# Dialyzing electrofilter with improved electrode.

## Abstract
A suspension of solids in a carrier liquid is dewatered by means of an electrically augmented vacuum filter EAVF . The EAVF includes an anodic structure 23 comprising an anode 26 , anolyte 38 and a filter membrane 27 for depositing solids from the suspension of solids thereon and a cathodic structure 22 comprising a cathode 34 , catholyte 35 , a catholyte chamber 30 , and a filtrate chamber 29 for filtering the filtrate of the bath of the suspension of solids. The catholyte chamber 30 has a membrane wall 32 which is liquid impervious and either an anion exchange membrane or a non ion selective membrane. Filtrate is removed at the filtrate chamber 29 .
