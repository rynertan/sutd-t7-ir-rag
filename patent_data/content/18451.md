## Description
s1INOLTNc APPAPATUS background of the Invention The present invention relates to machines for assembling and fastening shingled forms, and more particularly to a machine which is specially adapted for rapidly and continuously assembling and fastening stacked sheets into shingled sets of predetermined count, wherein it is not necessary to provide punched index holes in the sides of the sheets. In prior art shingling machines, individual sheets which could be discrete web units composed of several sheets or layers are assembled into shingled, fastened assemblies, but there have been several undesirable limitations. For exenple, when the stack of sheets or web units was exhausted in the machine, it was frequently necessary to stop the operation of the machine to replenish the supply, since the sheets or web units were withdrawn from the top of the supply stack. Another disadvantage.Eças the necessity to provide index holes punched in the sides of the sheet. That is, as the sheets were being asseI,bled, indexing teeth engaged within the holes to advance and space the sheets. In some applications, the index holes were objectionable. Also, the spacing of the index holes and of the teeth necessarily determined the indexing or spacing of the sheets, limiting the apparatus to the production of assemblies or sets with spacings corresponding only to the formats possible with the available teeth and punched hole spacings. Summary of the Invention Briefly, the present invention overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art with an apparatus which feeds the sheets individually from the bottom of a supply stack, indexes them for accurate positioning before they are placed on the conveyor, and then glues them to one another on the conveyor, while incrementally advancing the conveyor to space the sheets so that they are shingled in a regular, partially overlapped relation thereon. The supply stack can be replenished as desired from the top while the apparatus remains in continuous operation. The sheets do not need to be punched since the apparatus automatically positions and indexes them for proper and accurate formation of the shingle. More specifically, the present invention includes a holding means or feed hopper which holds a supply stack of the sheets, from which the sheets can be removed from the bottom one at a time. A transport means removes the sheets from the bottom of the stack and transports them to a predetermined position spaced from the stack. A transfer means receives each sheet individually at the predetermined position and transfers the sheets accurately onto a conveyor which is adjacent thereto. The conveyor is then advanced at a predetermined rate to cause the sheets to be shingled in a regular, partially overlapped relation thereon, as the sheets are fastened to one another in this shingled, overlapped relation. In the preferred embodiment, the sheets are fastened by gluing them to one another, and there is provision for periodically interrupting the gluing pf the sheets at predetermined intervals to divide the shingled sheets into sets of predetermined numbers. The sheets are pulled and transported from the bottom of the stack, in part, by a support plate in the bottom of the supply hopper, part of which is stationary, and part of which is hinged for upward and downward oscillating movement, especially on the edge opposite the hinge. The moving edge has vacuum ports therein which affirmatively pull the lowermost sheet downwardly from the bottom of the stack as the oscillating plate is pivoted downwardly. The stationary plate supports the remainder of the stack in the hopper so only the lowermost sheet is released as it is pulled downwardly by the vacuum olDcnings in the oscillating plate. Grippcrs then engage the do ..rnwardly pulled sect, remove it frozen the plate, and place it on a reciprocating slide which advances it to register stops which define thc predetermined position. Side and front joggers assure that the sheet will be properly positioned against the register stops, and as the slide is withdrawn and returned to the hopper to receive another sheet, a vacuum transfer plate engages the sheet at the register stops and lowers it for positively depositing it on the conveyor. The conveyor is formed of several parallel vacuum belts with perforations therethrough communicating with vacuum boxes on the sides of the belts opposite the sheets, so the sheets are held firmly on the conveyor.This assures regular, proper, and uniform development of the shingled sheet assemblies on the conveyor during the advancing thereof, without requiring mechanical coupling between the conveyor and the sheets thereon. A gluer moves upwardly and dozTnçardly with the vacuum transfer plate to apply glue to the individual sheets as they are deposited on the conveyor. The glue is applied to portions, usually edge portions, of the top surface of each sheet, and, as indicated above, is omitted when one set of sheets is to be separated from another. This periodic interruption of the gluer operation may be under the control, for example, of a suitable counting device. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved apparatus for asse nbling and fastening stacked sheets into shingled sets an apparatus which is capable of substantially continuous, uninterrupted operation for indefinite periods in wliich the sheets can be replenished in a supply stack at any time, even during operation of the apparatus, b adding additional sheets to the top of the stack in which the sheets are withdrawn from the bottom of the stack, accurately indexed to a predetermined position, and then transferred onto a conveyor in which the conveyor is advanced at a predetermined rate to cause the sheets tb be shingled in a regular, partially overlapped relation thereon in which the sheets are fastened to one another in the shingled, overlapped relation in which the fastening of the sheets may be interrupted at predetermined intervals for dividing the sheets into shingled sets in which sheets of many different configurations, including multi ply webs, folded webs, and webs which do not have index holes in them, can be readily, quickly, and accurately assembled in which the spacing or overlap of the sheets in the sets is readily and easily adjustable independently of the properties of the sheets themselves and to accomplish the above objects and purposes in an uncomplicated, versatile, and reliable configuration which is readily adapted to the convenient and rapid processing of a wide variety of sheets into shingled sets. Other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description, the accompanying drawings and the appended claims.

Description of the Preferred ambod ent Fig. 1 shows a shingling apparatus 10 having a feed hopper 12 which is open at the top 13 thereof for receiving a supply stack 14 of sheets 15 which are to be formed into shingled sets. The term sheets is used in a broad sense, and is meant to refer two discrete web units which could be single sheets, or could be formed of several layers, could be folded, bi folded, and so on, as desired. The bottom of hopper 12 is defined by a stationary plate 19 and an oscillating plate 20. topper 12 is slightly tilted, with the lowest portion thereof being defined by stationary plate 19, on which the sheets 15 in stack 14 are principally supported. Oscillating plate 20 is hinged at 21 to stationary plate 19, so that the edge 22 of oscillating plate 20 which is opposite hinge 21 can be reciprocated upwardly and downwardly at the bottom of the feed hopper 12. Edge 22 of plate 20 is at a location slightly inward from the edge of the sheet thereon, so that the sheet projects beyond edge 22. Edge 22 has openings 23 therein which are connected to a suitable source of vacuum. The vacuum opcnings 23 engage and affirmatively pull the lowermost sheet from the bottom of the stack 14 as plate 20 is oscillated downwardly on hinge 21. This separates the lowermost sheet from the remainder of the sheets in stack 14, the remaining sheets being supported and remaining in position on the stationary plate 19. The lowermost sleet itself is flexed or bent but not creased around hinge 21, to expose the sheet to several grippers 25. Grippers 25 are supported at 26 to swing on an axis toward and away from oscillating plate edge 22 when in its lower position as shown inFig. 1. The grippers 25 engage the projecting edge of the sheet which has been pulled down from the bottom of stack 14, the vacuum in openings 23 is then released, and the grippers pull the sheet out from the stack onto a reciprocating slide 30. The sheet is guided onto slide 30 by fingers 31 thereabove, the grippers 25 pulling the sheet between the fingers and the slide. Slide 30 has a rear ledge 32 extending up therefrom. Grippers 25 pull the. sheet past ledge 32 so that the ledge can engage the sheet to propel it forwardly. The grippers then release the sheet, hinge 26 is raised to space the grippers from the sheet, and the grippers return to hopper 12 to engage and pull another sheet from the bottom of the supply stack 14. To assist in depositing the sheet 15 in slide 30, fingers 31 may include downwardly directed air jets, if desired. Once the sheet is resting on slide 30, the slide moves forwardly toward several register stops 35 which, in combination with a side registration plate 36, define a predetermined indexing or registered position spaced from stack 14. Slide 30 reciprocates back and forth between the position Fig. 3c in which grippers 25 deposit a sheet thereon, and the position Fig. 3e at register stops 35 where the sheet is removed from slide 30. The sheet is removed by first carrying it over the register stops 35 as slide 30 is advanced therepast the rear ledge 32 thereof propelling the sheet over the stops 35 . Stops 35 then prevent the sheet from returning with slide 30 as it is moved back toward the grippers 25. To assure accurate indexing of each sheet, and thus accurate formation of the shingled sets, side and front joggers 37 and 38 are 3nomentarilb pressed against the sheet as slide 30 begins to return to grippers 25 and hopper 12. he side and rear joggers 37 and 33 engage the edges of the sheet opposite the register stops 35 and side registration plate 36 to prcss the shect firmly against stops 35 and plate 36 for accurate indexing thereof. A vacuum transfer plate 40 then engages the sheet in the predetermined indexing position Fig. 3e and holds it there while slide 30 reciprocates back to grippers 25 and hopper 12. Plate 40 prevents the sheet from falling haphazardly when slide 30 is withdrawn and no longer supports the sheet. The vacuum transfer plate than cycles downwardly to transfer the sheet accurately into position on a conveyor 45 located therebeneath. When the sheet is properly positioned on conveyor 45, the vacuum in the vacuum transfer plate 40 is released, depositing the sheet on conveyor 45. Conveyor 45 consists of several belts 46 which are perforated and pass over vacuum boxes 47 to hold the shingled sheets firmly on the conveyor. A gluer 50 is independently reciprocated with the vacuum transfer plate 40 to deposit spots of glue on the top edge of each sheet as it is lowered onto conveyor 4 5. This fastens the sheets directly to one another. Separation of the connected sheets into shingled sets is accomplished by intermittently inhibiting operation of gluer 50, such that predetermined ones of the sheets receive no glue, thus dividing the progressing sheets into predetermined shingled sets. In the preferred embodiment, operation of gluer 50 is inhibited simply by preventing it from reciprocating downwardly with vacuum transfer plate 40 Fig. 4 when the particular sheet which is not to be glued is being deposited on conveyor 45. A suitable drive 55 correlates the operation of the entire shingling apparatus 10. Thus, drive 55 operates the oscillating plate 20, grippers 25, and slide 30, which, together, form a transport means for individually transporting the sheets one at a time from the bottom of supply stack 14 to the predetermined position defined by the register stops 35 and side registration plate 36. Drive 55 also operates the transfer plate 40, fastening means or gluer 50, and conveyor 45, and regulates the timing of the vacuum to plate 20 and transfer plate 40. More specifically, drive 55 advances conveyor 45 at a predetermined rate to cause the sheets to be shingled in a regular, partially overlapped relation thereon. In the preferred embodiment, conveyor 45 is advanced intermittently by drive 55 in predetermined increments, between the transfers of the sheets 15 thereonto. The vacuum boxes 47 are extended to hold the sheets on conveyor 45.until the glue sets up. Mechanical coupling between the conveyor. and the sheets. is therefore not required,he shingled sets may be developed regularly and uniformly on the conveyor in any increments or spacings desired, strictly as a function of the rate at which the conveyor is advanced or incremented. Customized shingling of forms, at any spacings, can therefore be readily and inexpensively provided by the present apparatus without the need for special preparation of the forms themselves. It is not necessary to use prepunched sheets in order to prepare the shingled sets. As may be seen, therefore, the present invention provides numerous advantages. It is versatile but inexpensive and uncomplicated in its design and operation.A wide variety of types and sizes of sheets, either single or multi ply, can readily and quickly be assembled into fastened, shingled sets. The apparatus can readily and quickly be set up with minimum preparation time, so that maximum productivity is realized. The sheets are fed from the bottom of the stack 14, so that the stack can be replenished while the apparatus 10 remains in operation. The shingled sets are automatically divided by inhibiting operation of the gluer at predeter mined intervals, so that the sets can subsequently be easily separated. The gluer itself can be located on either side of the apparatus 10, according to the type of shingle which is tobe developed. While the form of apparatus herein described constitutes a preferred embodiment of this invention, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto, and that changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.
