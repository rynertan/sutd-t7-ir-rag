# Electrodeless fluorescent light source having reduced far field electromagnetic radiation levels.

## Abstract
An electrodeless fluorescent light source includes an electrodeless fluorescent lamp 70 having a phosphor coating on its inner surface 74 and an induction coil 72 wherein the magnitude of the far field electromagnetic radiation, produced directly by the induction coil 72 , is minimized. The induction coil 72 is driven by a high frequency power source 78 . The induction coil 72 includes current loops which are configured so that the magnetic dipole moment of each current loop is offset by the magnetic dipole moment of other current loops in order to minimize the net magnetic dipole moment of the induction coil 72 . One embodiment of the induction coil 72 includes a conductor wound in the shape of a square prism. The current on adjacent side edges of the prism is in opposite directions, thus resulting in two pairs of mutually opposing magnetic dipole moments.
