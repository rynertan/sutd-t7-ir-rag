# A light activated monolithic zero crossing triac driver.

## Abstract
A monolithic, light activated zero crossing triac driver is provided that includes back to back thyristors 1, 2, 1 , 2 , whose gates are shunted by both a resistor 5, 5 to reduce the overall sensitivity and a first field effect transistor 6, 6 . A second field effect transistor 8, 8 shunts the gate of the first field effect transistor. A photovoltaic diode 7, 7 is coupled between the base of the thyristor and the gates of the first and second field effect transistors and serves as a current source to charge the gate capacitance of the first field effect transistor.
