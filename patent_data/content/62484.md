# Method of cutting glass with a laser.

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for cutting glass 9 with a laser. The glass 9 is superposed a suitable support 7 and a laser beam 11A is directed onto the glass 9 . The laser beam 11A is focused to a point disposed at or about the surtace 23 of the glass 9 . The focused laser beam 11A vaporizes a first thickness of glass 9 , less than the entire thickness, and simultaneously heats the remaining thickness above the an nealing temperature of the glass 9 . A jet of gas 28 incident upon the laser focal point removes the heated and vaporized glass proximate the focal point 23 to create a hole through the glass. By effecting movement between the glass 9 and the laser 11A and gas jet 29 at a predetermined rate, the glass 9 is cut. Also disclosed is an article including a unitary first sheet of glass having at least one complimental opening of predetermined configuration that does not extend to the edge of the glass and is cut by a laser. One or more complimentary glass inserts coplanar with the first glass are disposed within the opening of the first glass, defining a groove therebetween A securing means is disposed in the groove to secure the complimentary pieces of glass in fixed edge to edge relation ship.
