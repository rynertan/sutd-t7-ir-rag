# Superconducting analog to digital converter with bidirectional counter.

## Abstract
An analog to digital converter quantizer and bidirec tional counter using superconducting quantum interference devices SQUID s as the principal elements. A double junction non latching SQUID is used as a quantizer to produce unipolar output pulses on two different output lines, indicative of positive and negative increments of change in an analog signal current. The unipolar pulses are then counted in a bidirectional counter that employs double junction non latching SQUID s as counter stages and as logic gates for the propagation of carry and borrow signals from stage to stage.
