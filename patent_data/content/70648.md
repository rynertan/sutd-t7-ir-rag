# Heat accumulative material.

## Abstract
A novel latent heat accumulative material capable of accumulating heat in a temperature range best suited for the storage of solar energy was obtained by adding an organic compound or compounds such as urea CO NH₂ ₂ to a system consisting of sodium acetate CH₃CO₂Na and water H₂O . Further addition of a crystal nucleus forming material or materials such as sodium pyrophosphate decahydrate Na₄P₂O₇ 10H₂O to said composition could minimize super cooling and allowed a wider scope of application of the present heat accumulative material.
