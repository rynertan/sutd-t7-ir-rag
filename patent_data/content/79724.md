# Sustained release capsule for ruminant animals.

## Abstract
A sustained release capsule adapted to be inserted into the rumen of ruminant animals has means for reducing the stress exerted on the retention arms of the capsule during insertion and use. Preferred embodiments of the capsule include means for preventing ruminal fluids from contacting the biologically active composition carried in the capsule except at the delivery opening.
