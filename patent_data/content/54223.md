# PLASMID VECTORS FOR EUKARYOTIC CELLS AND METHOD FOR SELECTING TRANSFECTED EUKARYOTIC CELLS

## Abstract
Improved vectors for screening eukaryotic transfor mants containing heterologous genes. The vectors comprise plasmids containing an insert consisting of a gene coding for an enzyme needed to produce an essential amino acid linked to multiple polyoma virus genes. By growing the transfor mant eukaryotic cells in a medium missing the essential amino acid corresponding to the vector gene and providing the precursor intermediate in the medium it is possible to screen for cells containing the vector.
