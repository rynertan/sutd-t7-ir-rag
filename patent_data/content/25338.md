# A stop joint between fluid filled electric cables.

## Abstract
In a stop joint between fluid filled electric cables 1, the barrier to flow of dielectric fluid from one to the other of the cables comprises an elongate metal members, by which the cable conductors 2 are both electrically and mechanically connected, and a flexible membrane 9 of fluid impermeable insulating material. The membrane 9, which is preferably a single sheet of the insulating material, is sealed to the elon gate metal members and to the fluid tight joint enclosure 21 and is incorporated in a lamin ated body 8 of lappings of paper and or other insulating material built up on the elongate metal member and on the cut back ends of the cables 1.
