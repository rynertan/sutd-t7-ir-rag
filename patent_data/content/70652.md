# Hard endoscopes.

## Abstract
A hard endoscope wherein light guide fibres 21 trans mitting illuminating light projected on paths toward an object from the tip of a probe sheath 13 are inserted in such a man ner that individual fibres are selectively curved near the tip, be ing fed though an outer tube 16 of the probe sheath and so disposed that the light distribution characteristics is favourably influenced. If illuminating light paths to be projected from the light guide fibre tips in an endoscope are not wet diffused, there may be a region in the field of view which the illuminating light paths do not reach and the position of an object will not be clearly observable. Therefore, in the present invention, an inner tube 17 in which an observing optical system is arranged is inserted eccentrically through an outer tube 16 of the probe sheath, the tip surfaces of the outer tube 16 and inner tube 17 are formed by cutting curved surfaces, and the light guide fibres 21 are inserted through the remaining part around the inner tube 17 within the outer tube 16 and so arranged as to improve the light distributing characteristics.
