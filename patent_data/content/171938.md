# SLIP COATING

## Abstract
A method of providing a slip coating on aluminised glass fibre chaff is provided in which the chaff is treated by applying a boundary lubricant dispersed within an aqueous medium, the boundary lubricant containing free palmitic acid and ammonium palmitate. The aqueous medium forms a hydrated aluminium oxide on the surface of the chaff and promotes a reaction between the surface oxide and the palmitic acid to provide a chemically bonded surface slip coating layer of aluminium palmitate.
