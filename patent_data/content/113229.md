# Coloured inorganic complex for use as a pigment and compositions containing it.

## Abstract
A coloured inorganic complex of titanium, stannous and zinc oxidesfor use in making pigments capable of imparting for example red, yellow or green colours to plastics, paints, glasses or ceramics without reliance on toxic moieties. A wider range of colours can be obtained if the complex is used in a pigment system comprising excess oxides of titanium and zinc or stannic tin. The complex is preferably made by adding an acidified aqueous solution of ions of the metals eg as metal sulphates or metal halides to alkali so as to precipitate the oxides or oxide precursor such as hydrated oxides which are then washed and fired at over 450 C to form the complex. The colours obtained may be adjusted by the presence of traces of residual alkali metal moiety.
