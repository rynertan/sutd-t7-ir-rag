# High throughput, high uniformity field emission devices.

## Abstract
Apparatus for field emission spraying of metal or alloys in the liquid state has a field electrode nozzle array formed of a face plate 12 insoluble in but wettable by the liquid to be sprayed and having two or more conical nozzles 14 therein. A reservoir 47 for the liquid is formed above face plate 12 and means 42 are provided to enable an electric current to be passed through the face plate whereby the latter heats and melts the metal to be sprayed.
