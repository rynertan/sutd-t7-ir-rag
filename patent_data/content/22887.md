## Description
apparatus for Supporting Large Dimension Curved Reflectors The present invention is directed toward the art of support structures for parabolic reflectors, and more particularly concerns a support structure for a large parabolic reflector which is intended primarily for use as a solar reflector and which is comprised of a large number of small reflecting sections arranged into a paraboloid. Large dimension parabolic refelectors, on the order of twenty feet in diameter and larger, have historically been proposed for use in a variety of applications, including use in a solar collection system. However, large dimension parabolic reflectors have always been difficult and expensive to manufacture and hence are presently considered impractical, except perhaps in special purpose applications, such as large telescopes. In addition to the cost involved in producing such a parabolic reflector per se, the support struct ure for such reflectors also is complicated and expensive. Additionally, the support structure must be designed for the particular reflector application, and a support structure suitable for one application would not necessarily be suitable for any other reflector applications. For instance, those support structures which have been developed for parabolic reflector telescopes are not suitable for solar collector applications, wherein the reflective surface must be as open as possible to the sun, and wherein the support structure must be capable of with standing llarskl weather environments, including high winds and hail, without amaze to either the support structure or the ref lector. Other large dinension curved structures besides parabolas have been constructed using a plurality of relatively small size plane sections of various forms.An example of using relatively small sections to construct a spherical structure is shown in U. S. Patent No. 2,978,704, titled Random Structural Devices. As suggested herein, large dimension parabolic reflectors can also be constructed with small size sections, at considerable cost savings over a single surface reflector. Although such a construction technique may significantly reduce the cost of producing a parabolic reflector per se, the problems of adequately supporting and protecting that structure, especially under extreme weather conditions, remain. To the best of the inventor s knowledge, there is very little information available concerning support structures for large dimension parabolic reflectors intended for outdoor use, especially where the reflector comprises a plurality of relatively small sections and is intended for use as a solar collector. Necessarily, such a support structure must have the proper strength in order to support the plurality of reflecting sections without breakage during normal operation, and must be capable of protecting the reflecting sections in weather extremes. It must further interfere only minimally, if at all, with the amount of sun reaching the reflecting surfaces of the individual sections. Additionally, such a support structure should be relatively inexpensive, so that the combined support structure parabolic reflector may be economically practical as a solar collector. Further, the support structure should be relatively simple and inexpensive to install on site, and must be capable of accurately tracking the sun in its moved ment across the sky. Accordingly, it is a general object of the present invention to provide a support structure for a parabolic reflector which overcomes one or more of the disadvantages of the prior art noted above. It is another object of the present invention to provide such an apparatus which is relatively simple to install on site. It is a further object of the present invention to provide such an apparatus which is capable of withstanding the stresses of weather extremes. It is another object of the present invention to provide such an apparatus which is capable of supporting a parabolic reflector without counterweights. It is an additional object of the present invention to provide such an apparatus which is capable of supporting a large dimension parabolic reflector comprised of a plurality of relatively small size reflecting sections. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide such an apparatus which is capable of supporting a multiple section parabolic reflector over an extended period of Lime without damaging the individual Sections. It is a still further object of the present invention to provide such an apparatus which permits the individual sections comprising the parabolic reflector to be separately focused. It is another object of the present invention to provide such an apparatus which is capable of tracking the sun with the parabolic reflector. Accordingly, there is provided a special purpose support structure for supporting large dimension reflectors which exhibit a curved surface, such as a parabolic reflector.The support structure includes a first rigid support matrix which comprises a plurality of strut like members which are joined together at matrix joints in such a manner that the first rigid support matrix approximates the curved shape of the large dimension reflector which it is to support.A plurality of standoff elements are provided in the support structure, with the standoff elements being connected to the matrix joints and extending away therefrom. Additionally, there are securing member mounted on each of the standoff elements for securing the curved reflector in position away from the first rigid support matrix. A more thorough understanding of the invention may be obtained by a study of the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a diagram showing the principal components of a solar collection system, including the support apparatus of the present invention. Figure 2 is a perspective view of one embodiment of the present invention, with a single support structure. Figure 3 is an exploded view of one portion of the embodiment of Figure 2. Figure 4 is a partial perspective view of another embodiment of the present invention, with a double support structure. Figure 5 is an exploded view of a portion of the embodiment of Figure 4. Figure 6 is a perspective view of a standoff element, a connecting hub, and a securing member which connect the two support structures and the reflecting sections of the embodiment of Figure 4. Figure 7 is a perspective view showing the axis structure between the support structure for the parabolic reflector and apparatus for tracking the sun. Figure 8 is a perspective view showing the structure for securing the individual reflecting sections in place to form a parabolic reflector. Referring now to Figure 1, the reflector support structure of the present invention is shown in the context of a complete solar energy collection system. A parabolic reflector is shown generally at 10, and is comprised of a plurality of triangular sections 11 11 of conventional mirrored glass. Triangular sections 11 11 may be plane or slightly curved or dished. Triangular sections 11 11 are arranged and positioned such that their respective apex points lie on the surface of a true parabola. Reflector 10 thus is substantially parabolic. In the embodiment shown in Figure 1, a first reflector support matrix, also of generally parabolic configuration, shown generally at 12, is provided inside parabolic reflector 10. Reflector support matrix 12 comprises a plurality of elongated rod like elements 13 13 which are joined together at their ends, at joints 14 14, to form a plurality of intersecting open triangles in a generally parabolic arrangement. The joints 14 L4, in the configuration shown, lie substantially on the surface of a true imaginary parabola. Extending outwardly from each joint 14, and fixedly connected thereto, is an elongated standoff element 15 which has located therealong positioning elements not shown in Figure 1 which may be moved longitudinally along standoff elements 15, and which hold triangular sections 11 11 at their apexes in a parabolic arrangement 10. In Figure 1, four triangular sections 11 11 are shown for each triangular portion of support matrix. This is shown most clearly in Figure 3. In an even more simple embodiment, the triangular sections 11 11 could be the same size as the triangular support matrix portions. A more complicated embodiment, using two support matrixes, wherein 16 triangular sections 11 11 are used for each triangular portion of the first support matrix is shown in Figures 4 and 5. A boiler 16 of conventional design and of a size which is commensurate with parabolic reflector 10, is located substantially at the focal point of parabolic reflector 10 and parabolic support matrix 12. An elongated support element 18 connects boiler 16 and the back center of the parabolic support matrix 12, and supports boiler 16 at the focal point thereof. The boiler 16 may take various configurations, and may be a mercury heat exchanger.An example of a boiler which may be useful is described inU. S. Patent No. 4,019,868, issued to Sebacher, et al, on April 26, 1977 and titled Solar Hydrogen Generator. Encircling parabolic reflector 10 and parabolic support matrix 12 is a terrain support apparatus which includes first and second support rings 20 and 22. The first support ring 20 is stationary and is supported off the ground at a selected angular orientation to the terrain by a plurality of upright posts 24 24. The second support iilly 22, which is of substantially the same configuration and size as tlle first support ring 20, is positioned on top of the first support ring and rotates relative to the first support ring by means of rollers or similar conventional devices 26 through a motor 31. Parabolic reflector 10 and parabolic support matrix 12 are secured to an axis structure 27 which is in turn rotatably connected to second support ring 22 through conventional means, such as a motor driven gear arrangement 29. This arrangement permits parabolic reflector 10 to be rotated within support rings 20 and 22. In operation, second support ring 22 is rotated relative to first support ring 20 at specified time intervals to maintain the correct reflector azimuth for the parabolic reflector 10, while parabolic reflector 10 itself is periodically rotated, through axis structure 27, to maintain a correct reflector altitude. Hence, parabolic reflector 10 follows the path of the sun as it moves from horizon to horizon. The sun s rays, when they strike the inside reflecting surface of parabolic reflector 10, are focused by the individual triangular sections 11 11 to the boiler 16. The boiling medium in boiler 16 is raised to a temperature between 600 F and 1000 F when plane triangular sections are used, and between 30000F and 6000 F, when curved triangular sections are used, resulting in superheated steam which can then be utilized to drive conventional steam generators or similar means. Figure 2 shows in more detail the parabolic reflector 10 and parabolic support matrix 12 shown in Figure 1.Parabolic support matrix 12 comprises a plurality of elongated struts or rods 13 joined together at their ends, at joints 14, in such an arrangement as to form the parabolic support matrix shown in Figure 2. The arrangement of struts 13 13 form a plurality of open triangles, with each strut 13, except for those in the top row, forming one side of 2 adjacent triangles. The specific arrangement of the triangles and their relative sizes can be obtained in a number of ways, but in the instant case was achieved by projecting the lower half of a subdivided isohedron onto a true parabolic surface. Each of the joints 14 14 lies substantially on the surface of a true parabola, while struts 13 13 extend in a straight line between joints 14 14. The upper row of struts 13 13 all lie in the same plane and form rim 30 of the support matrix, as shown in Figure 2, while the remainder of support matrix 12 extends downward therefrom in a parabolic configuration. The individual struts 13 13 are of varying length, depending upon their location in the support matrix. In the embodiment shown, struts 13 13 are lengths of 1 1 2 galvanized pipe, since galvanized pipe offers relatively high strength at a low cost. Other materials, however, such as aluminum tubing, can be effectively used. Stabilizing rim 30 are a plurality of guide wires 34 shown in Figure 2 but not Figure 1 which run cross ways of rim 30 from each joint 14 on the riio tc an opposing joint on the opposite side of the rim. Hence, each joint 14 or rim 30 is connected by stiff wire, or small diameter tubing, to an opposing joint on the rim. Guide wires 34 provide necessary support structure rigidity. The structure of the joints 14 14 is shown more clearly in Figure 6. The construction of each joint 14 will vary depending upon its location, and whether there is more than one support matrix provided. Each joint will include a full hub or collar element which is shown generally at 35, a triangular section securing element, shown generally at 42, and a standoff element 15. When two support matrixes are used a modified hub 36 is included at each joint. A full hub 35 is used wherever the struts forming either the first or second matrixes are joined. A modified hub 36 is used for attaching a standoff element 15 to a strut 13 intermediate of its ends. Joint 14 shown in Figure 6 is the joint structure shown as 38 in Figure 4. It includes a tubular T shaped modified hub 36, having a cross member 36a which is secured to a single strut 13 in the first support structure, and a base member 36b, into which one end of standoff element 15 is inserted. The modified hub 36 is positioned intermediate of the strut 13 and is used both on the first and second support structures to permit subdivision of each structural support portion. Midway along standoff element 15 in Figure 6 is a full hub 35 which receives the ends of various numbers of struts 132 depending upon location, in a second support matrix. Hub 35 includes a central ring 35a, through the center of which standoff element 15 extends, and a plurality of fins 35b 35b which extend radially outward from central ring 35a and which receive the ends of struts 13. Standpff elenlent 15 in Figure 6 is a rod like strut which extends perpendicularly from modified hub 36 and through full hub 35 so that it hence extends perpendicularly from a plane which is tangent to an imaginary parabolic surface connecting each joint of the parabolic support matrix. The length of standoff element 15 depends upon the number of parabolic support matrixes used. In the embodiment of Figure 2, for instance, only one support matrix is shown, and the length of standoff element 15 is approximately 2 inches. In the embodiment of Figure 4, standoff element 15 might be approximately 4 inches. Located near the end of standoff element 15 is securing element 42, which holds one apex of several triangular reflecting sections 11 11 firmly in place.Positioning element 42 of Figure 6 comprises two relatively thin members 44a, 44b of a flexible but stiff material, such as a stiff rubber or teflon, which, when moved close together, hold the apexes of several triangular reflecting sections 11 11 in place to form the parabolic reflector 10.When stiff members 44 and 46 are held close enough together by plate 46 and by nut and washer arrangement 45, several triangular reflecting sectionsll ll may be held firmly in position, as shown in Figures 6 and 8. Members 44a and 44b are sufficiently flexible, however, to permit a slight movement of reflecting sections 11 11 to take up a certain amount of environmental stresses, particularly changes in temperature, without breakage. At no time will securing element 42, and hence reflecting sections ll ll,come into contact with the parabolic support matrix 12, and hence, no stress will be placed on reflecting sections 11 11 by the parabolic reflector structure itself. A further key structural advantage to securing element 42 is that it may be moved a ways longitudinally along standoff element 15, permitting individual focusing of each reflecting sections 11 11 onto boiler 16. In this manner, the parabolic reflector 10 may be tuned to maximum effectiveness. Reflecting sections 11 11 may be comprised of a number of different materials, among them being glass and polished metal, such as aluminum. It has been found, however, that the conventional double sided mirror, silvered on the backside1 is the best when both cost and reflective quality are considered. The support structure of the present invention permits the use of this relatively inexpensive material. The reflecting sections 11 11 may be plane. which is a relatively easy and inexpensive shape to manufacture, or they may be slightly curved. If reflecting sections 11 11 are curved, the total reflecting quality of the complete parabolic reflector 10 will be better than with plane reflecting sections, and the solar collector operation will improve. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has developed a method of fabricating curved silvered glass which is suitable for use with the present invention. It is available on microfilm under the number NTIS N75 32894 8ST in engineering libraries of several universities, under the title Liyht Weight Reflector Assembly and Method. It should be understood, however, that the present invention is capable of functioning efficiently with plane reflecting sections. In the embodiment shown in Figure 2, the support matrix 12 is provided inside the reflector 10. This configuration has been found to reduce the amount of reflected sunlight to the boiler by approximately 15 , which is acceptable in view of the cost savings produced in construction of large parabolic reflectors by use of the support structures disclosed herein. Referring again to Figure 1, the combination of parabolic reflector 10 and parabolic support matrix 12 is encircled by first and second support rings 20 and 22.Support ring 22 rides on top of support ring 20, by means of conventional rollers 26 or similar devices. Support rings 20 and 22 are substantially circular in configuration, and have diameters slightly greater than the diameter of parabolic reflector 10. In the case of a 30 foot diameter parabolic reflector, for instance, the diameter of support rings 20 and 22 is approximately 31.82 feet. First and second support rings 20, 22 may be constructed of a variety of materials, but in the embodiment shown are aluminum tubing, approximately 4 inches thick and 9 inches wide. It should be understood, however, that rings 20 and 22 may take various configurations. They may be square or rectangular in cross section or they may be two non girders formed into circles. Support ring 20 is supported off the terrain by means of a plurality of posts 24, at an angle 52 from the vertical which is equal to the latitude of the particular terrain location of the collector. Hence, the angle 52 of the support rings will vary, depending upon the latitude of the location of the apparatus. Hence, first support ring 20 is fixedly supported by means of a plurality of support posts 24, while second support ring 22 is rotatably connected to support ring 20 by means of rollers or the like, driven by means of motor driven gearing 31. Figure 7 shows in more detail the axis structure 27 by which the combination of parabolic reflector 10 and parabolic support matrix 12 is rotatably connected to support ring 22. A series of struts 60 are connected between 1 the ends of a number of standoff elements which extend from hubs 35, and 2 a common joint 62, which in turn extends into a short axle and gear arrangement 64, which controls rotation of the combination relative to first and second support rings 20 and 22. Axis structure 27 extends through reflector 10 and support matrix 12 at approximately their combined center of gravity, and hence, no counterweights are needed to stabilize the reflector during rotation. Such an arrangement permits support matrix 12 and hence, parabolic reflector 10 as well, to follow the path of the sun as it moves across the sky. It also permits reflector support matrix 12 and reflector 10 to be rotated so that they face the terrain. Typically, a fairly rigid liyhturight protective covering not shown may be provided over the exterior of the reflector 10 so that when the support matrix 12 and reflector 10 are rotated upside down, the protective covering is exposed to the weather. The protective covering serves to protect the reflector during extreme weather conditions, in particular, hail, dust storms, and high winds. Referring now to Figures 4 and 5, there is shown another embodiment of the present invention.which is somewhat more complicated than the embodiment of Figures 2 and 3. In the embodiment of Figures 4 and 5, an intermediate parabolic support matrix 70 is provided between a base parabolic support matrix 72 and a parabolic reflector 74.A substantial portion of the complete structure is shown in Figure 4. The arrangement of this embodiment is shown most clearly in Figure 5, wherein the relationship between a single portion of the base parabolic support matrix is shown with its corresponding intermediate support matrix and corresponding reflector structure. As with the embodiment of Figures 2 and 3, the more complex embodiment includes a first set of standoff elements 76 located at each joint 78 of each triangular portion 80 of the base parabolic support structure, and a second set of standoff elements 82 intermediate of each pair of joints 78 78.Hubs not shown such as hubs 35 in Figure 6,are located at each joint 78 while modified hubs not showri, such as hubs 36 in Figure 6, are used intermediate of joints 78. The intermediate parabolic support matrix 70 comprises a plurality of struts 86 which are approximately half as long as the struts comprising base parabolic support matrix 68. Each strut 86 is connected between hubs not shown which are similar to hubs 35 in Figure 6,which are positioned on standoff elements 76 and 82, as shown in Figure 5. This results in a four triangle section of intermediate support matrix for each portion 80 of base support matrix. Struts 86 may be lighter in weight than those struts comprising the base parabolic support matrix. For example, struts having a diameter of 1 2 inch and a wall thickness of 1 16th inch have been found to be useful for a 30 foot diameter reflector.In addition to standoff elements 78 and 82 which extend through the hubs which support struts 86, further standoff elements 92 are provided, located intermediate each strut 86 and connected thereto by a modified hub not shown similar to hub 36 shown in Figure 6. At the end of standoff elements 7S, 82 and 92, a securing element not shown similar to element 42 inFigure 6 is provided to hold the reflecting sections which fit together to comprise the parabolic reflector 10. Because standoff elements 78, 82 and 92 all support individual reflecting sections 94 94, there are four reflecting sections for each intermediate support matrix section, and hence sixteen reflecting sections for each portion 80 of the base support matrix 72. This arrangement is shown most clearly in Figure 5. In the entodimellt of Figure 4, which was developed by projecting a subdivided isohedron oslto a parabolic surface, there are 40 triangular shaped portions which comprise the base parabolic support matrix. Hence, a total of 640 reflecting sections will comprise the parabolic reflector 10. The support structure described above is advantageous, as it hds sufficient strength to support the reflecting sections, and to take up environmental stress, so as to minimize possible damage to the reflecting sections. In addition, such a structure permits the reflecting sections to be individually focused on to a boiler, increasing the potential efficiency of the reflector. In the arrangement shown above, each reflecting section reflects substantially the same amount of light to the boiler when the reflector is properly oriented with respect to the sun. The above described support structure permits, in practical terms, the use of plane triangles to construct a large dimension parabolic reflector. Such a complete structure can be used advantageously in solar collection systems. The support structure is relatively inexpensive, as it can be made from commercially available, relatively inexpensive, materials, and can be assembled quickly and easily on site. It has extremely high strength, and can protect the reflector structure against weather extremes, particularly high winds and hail, without blocking a sub stulltidi cifllou t of light front tlle reflector. Although a preferred embodiment of the invention has been disclosed for purposes of explanation, it should be understood that various changes, and modifications can be made to the embodiment shown without departing from the spirit of the invention. It should be understood, for instance, that although the support matrix is shown as being interior of the reflecting sections, the same principles could be used to provide an exterior support matrix. Additionally, it should be understood that the particular hub configuration shown is not critical. Various configurations may be successfully used. The invention is defined by the claims, which follow.
