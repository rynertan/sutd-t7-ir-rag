This invention relates to an optically active triazolyl alcohol derivative having an optical activity of and the E geometric configuration which may be represented by formula I , wherein the asterisk indicates an asymmetric carbon atom and salts thereof, a process for preparing same, and plant growth regulatory and herbicidal compositions containing the same as active ingredient and the use of this compound in the preparation of plant growth regulatory and herbicidal preparations. The present application is divided from European Patent Application no 81305873.2 granted as EP O 054 431 The triazolyl alcohol derivative of formula I has optical isomers due to the asymmetric carbon atom C . The triazolyl alcohol derivative I having an optical activity of , as above referred to, is an optical isomer which shows an optical rotation of , as measured in chloroform with sodium D line, and is hereinafter referred to as the triazolyl alcohol derivative. On the other hand, another isomer which shows an optical rotation of is hereinafter referred to as the triazolyl alcohol derivative. Salts of the triazolyl alcohol derivative are also included in the scope of this invention. These salts are salts with the plant physiologically tolerable acids. Examples of such acids include hydrogen halides such as hydrobromic acid, hydrochloric acid and hydroiodic acid carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, maleic acid and succinic acid sulfonic acids such as p toluenesulfonic acid and methanesulfonic acid nitric acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid. These salts are obtained in a customary manner. The present inventors examined in detail the usefulness of or triazolyl alcohol derivatives I obtained by the process of this invention. Upon comparison of , and racemic triazolyl alcohol derivatives with one another, it was found that the fungicidal activity falls in the order triazolyl alcohol derivative racemic triazolyl alcohol derivative triazolyl alcohol derivative, whilst the plant growth regulatory activity and the herbicidal activity are in the order triazolyl alcohol derivative racemic triazolylalcohol derivative triazolyl alcohol derivative. In short, the present inventors have discovered an entirely new fact that a triazolyl alcohol derivative exhibits an excellent fungicidal activity, while a triazolyl alcohol derivative exhibits an excellent plant growth regulatory activity and herbicidal activity. The present invention contributes much to the cultivation of plants in the fields of agriculture and horticulture. For instance, application of a more active chemical is connected to adequate application of a smaller amount of the chemical, which leads to the improvement in economics of the processes of manufacture, transportation and field application and to the expectation of minimizing the environmental pollution as well as the improvement in safety. As stated above, the triazolyl alcohol derivative can be utilized as a plant growth regulator to regulate the growth of useful plants. For instance, it can be applied to keep the rice plant, wheat and barley, lawn grass, hedge plants and fruit trees from spindle growth and also to effect dwarfing of potted garden plants such as chrysanthemum, pansy, poinsettia, azalea and rhododendron. In rice cropping and wheat or barley cropping, the lodging of rice, wheat or barley plants caused by excessive application of fertilizers or by gales often presents an important problem. By applying the triazolyl alcohol derivative to rice, wheat or barley at a proper stage of growth, spindling can be suppressed so that the plant height may be suitably controlled to keep effectively the plant from lodging. In the cultivation of chrysanthemum in pot, application of the compound results in a reduction in the stem length without injurious effect on the flower, thus improving the commercial value of the plant. Further, the triazolyl alcohol derivative exhibits a strong herbicidal activity against gramineous weeds such as barnyard millet, large crabgrass and green foxtail cyperaceous weeds such as purple nutsedge broad leaved weeds in upland field such as green amaranth, fat hen, common purslane and common chickweed annual and perennial weeds in paddy field such as barnyardgrass, monochoria, spike flowered rotala, When applied to an upland field, the triazolyl alcohol derivative exhibits a strong activity against principal weeds and is effective for the pre emergence treatment of soil as well as for the foliage treatment in an early stage of growth. The compound has tremendous advantages in that it has no harmful effect on principal crops such as rice, soybean, cotton, corn, peanut, sunflower and sugar beet and can be safely used also for the vegetables such as lettuce, radish and tomato. The compound, therefore, is useful for weeding in a variety of situations such as in grain fields, vegetable gardens, orchards, lawns, pastures, tea fields, mulberry fields, rubber plantations, forest lands and non cultivated fields. It was found, moreover, that the compound is highly nontoxic to mammals and fishes and is substantially harmless to agriculturally useful crops. The methods for preparing the triazolyl alcohol derivative include those used in preparing conventional optically active substances such as asymmetric reduction and resolution of the diastereomer obtained from a racemate and an optically active reactive compound. These methods are described below in detail. The racemate of the present compound is obtained by reducing a ketone compound represented by the general formula II with a metal hydrogen complex such as lithium aluminum hydride LiAlH₄ or sodium borohydride NaBH₄ Japanese Patent Publication Kokai Laid open No. 124,771 1980 . Asymmetric reduction is commonly conducted by utilizing the enantioselective reaction which takes place when a ketone compound II is reduced with a chiral metal hydrogen complex. A few of such procedures are described below. The asymmetric reduction is conducted by adding a ketone compound II dissolved in a suitable solvent to the chiral modified lithium aluminum hydride prepared as in a or b described above. The solvent is the same as described in a . The reaction temperature is preferably 0 C or below, though a temperature between 80 C and the boiling point of the solvent can be used. After completion of the reaction, the complex compound is decomposed by the addition of a dilute aqueous acidic solution and the reaction mixture is purified by extraction, silica gel column chromatography or recrystallization to obtain the intended product. A method for resolving optical isomers by use of diastereomer esters formed from a racemic alcohol compound and an optically active reactive compound has been known literature Org. Reaction, Vol. 2, 380 . A diastereomeric ester mixture IV is obtained by allowing a racemate of triazolyl alcohol compound I to react with a reactive derivative of optically active carboxylic acid in the presence of a base. The triazolyl alcohol derivative I is obtained by resolving said diastereomeric ester mixture by chromatography or fractional crystallization into the ester of the triazolyl alcohol and the ester of the triazolyl alcohol, and decomposing the ester of the triazolyl alcohol. In the above formulae, the asterisk is as defined above. As examples of the optically active carboxylic acids for use in the esterification of racemate of the triazolyl alcohol I , there are menthoxyacetic acid, or N trifluoroacetylproline, camphoric acid, or mandelic acid, or 2 phenylpropionic acid, or 2 isopropyl 4 chlorophenylacetic acid, or α methoxy α trifluoromethylphenylacetic acid, or cis chrysanthemic acid, and or transchrysanthemic acid. The reactive derivatives of these optically active carboxylic acids include acid halides and acid anhydrides. Generally, the optically active carboxylic acid is converted into an acid halide in a customary manner and allowed to react with the racemate of the triazolyl alcohol I to effect esterification. The reaction is conducted in a common inert solvent e.g., acetone, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, benzene, toluene, dichloromethane, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride and in the presence of a dehydrohalogenation agent e.g., triethylamine, N,N dimethylaniline and pyridine . Generally, 1 to 5 moles of an acyl halide and a dehydrohalogenation agent are used for one mole of the triazolyl alcohol racemate I . Pyridine behaves also as a solvent when used in excess. The reaction temperature is in the range of from room temperature to the boiling point of the solvent. It is of course possible to prepare the diastereomeric ester by using the anhydride of an optically active carboxylic acid. When the diastereomeric mixture of a triazolyl alcohol ester V obtained as described above is crystallizable, it is resolved by repeated fractional crystallization, while if it is in oily form, the resolution is effected by column chromatography or high speed liquid chromatography. The ester of the triazolyl alcohol ester thus formed is decomposed in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide in a suitable solvent such as water or an aqueous organic solvent ethanol or methanol is generally used to obtain the triazolyl alcohol derivative I . In the field application of the compound of this invention obtained as described above, it may be used either alone without the addition of other ingredients or in mixtures with a carrier to make them more convenient for use as a herbicide and a plant growth regulator. Examples of the usual preparation forms include dust, wettable powder, oil spray, emulsion, tablet, granule, fine granule, aerosol and flowable. These preparations contain generally 0.1 to 95.0 , preferably 0.2 to 90.0 by weight of the active compound including other active ingredients . A suitable application rate is 2 to 500 g 10 ares and a preferable concentration of the active ingredients for field application is 0.001 to 1.0 . However, the concentration may be suitably increased or decreased without sticking to the said range, because the application rate and the concentration depend on the type of preparation, application time of the year, method of application, site of application and the type of crop to be treated. For use as a herbicide and plant growth regulator, the present compound can be mixed with fungicides and insecticides, and even a synergetic effect is expectable from such a mixture.
