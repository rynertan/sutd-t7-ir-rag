# Positioning servo system.

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with a positioning servo system for positioning a transducer over a recorded track, particularly with reference to the positioning of a reading head in a disc memory. It is known to provide servo tracks in spaced sectors interrupting recorded user data tracks, the boundary between adjacent servo tracks defining the centre of the user data track with which the transducer must be aligned. The present invention provides an accurate and reliable system of this kind. Each servo track sector 17, 19 has a header region recorded with a sync reference waveform, and a tail region recorded in alternate tracks with one or the other of two servo waveforms. The sync reference signal read from the transducer 15 is used to synchronise a phase locked oscillator and this provides signals for modulating the servo signals read by the transducer in the tail region of the sector. The modulated signals are detected and compared and their difference used to drive the actuator which controls the position of the transducer 15 . Gating means may be provided for enabling the phase locked oscillator only after the beginning of the sync reference signals.
