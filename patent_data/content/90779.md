# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE EXECUTION OF A GASTRO ESOPHAGEAL PHMETRIC TEST

## Abstract
An apparatus for the execution of a gastro esophageal pHmetric test, particularly for pH monitoring throughout 24 hours, avoiding patient hospitalization and allowing the latter to continue normal life habits. It comprises a pHmetric elec trode opportunely positioned in the patient s esophagus and or stomach and a portable recording unit of very small dimen sions, that is given to the patient to be tested, connected to said electrode. The recording unit comprises voltage frequen cy converter that receives a DC signal from the electrode and produces a frequency signal proportional to the amplitude of the input signal it also comprises a timer connected between said converter and a recording device, for enabling the frequen cy signal to be transferred to said device and simultaneously for actuating the same in correspondence with prefixed sampling intervals. The apparatus comprises finally a unit for analysing said frequency signal and visualising the test results.
