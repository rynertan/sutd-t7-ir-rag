# SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM AND SOLAR HEAT COLLECTOR

## Abstract
The invention relates to a solar energy system compris ing a collector consisting of a sloping space exposed to solar light for a heat transporting medium performing a primary circulation, which is thermally coupled by the downward run with a working medium circuit. An object of the invention is to design a solar energy system in a manner such that in contrast to the conventional system no control or safety apparatus is required, since solely natural, physical mechanisms are used so that a self controlling operation is obtained, as a result of which the risk of disturbances and standstill is considerably reduced and the intrinsic safety is enhanced. The above mentioned purposes are, in general, achieved by means of a system set forth in the preamble, the primary circulation of which takes place in a vessel partly filled with fluid and partly with the vapour thereof and operating as a heat pipe. The invention further provides a solar heat collector, the active surface of which is divided into cells bounded by upright ribs. Owing to the provision of such cells the dissipation of heat by convection due to wind brushing past can be reduced to negligible proportions.
