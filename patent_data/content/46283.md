# 4 Phenoxy 2 butene derivatives and their use as plant growth regulators.

## Abstract
4 Phenoxy 2 butene derivatives are disclosed as inhibitors of cytokinin plant growth regulatory activity, and as possessing seed germination regulatory properties and senescence delaying activity when applied to plants. 4 Phenoxy 2 butene derivatives may also be useful as plant dwarfing agents, agents to retard seedling development or as herbicides.
