## Description
This invention relates generally to electrical switches and is particularly directed to a multi position switch for use in an electrical device having a rechargeable battery. There are currently available many electrically operated devices which utilize rechargeable batteries as their power source. Such devices include, but are not limited to, toothbrushes, flashlights, radios, tape recorders, cigarette lighters, grass shears, hedge trimmers, screwdrivers, and the like. These devices generally have a control switch operable between ON and OFF positions for controlling the operation of the device. In addition, a pair of electrical prongs are provided for insertion in a conventional AC outlet for the recharging of the storage batteries therein. In early rechargeable devices the electrical prongs extending therefrom were subject to damage and deformation by contact with other objects. This problem was somewhat alleviated in later designs by positioning the electrical prongs within a recessed portion of the device. While this arrangement provided a certain amount of protection for the elongated prongs, it unfortunately increased the complexity and cost of the rechargeable device. Moreover, in this arrangement it was still possible to turn the device on while attempting to recharge its batteries. In most cases, such operation would prevent the recharging of the batteries and preclude normal operation of the device. In some rechargeable electrical devices the recharging of the batteries is accomplished either by a separate recharging unit or by a recharging unit integral with the device. The separate recharging unit approach has the disadvantage of requiring the storage of the recharging unit when not in use and of not having the recharging unit immediately available when needed. A disadvantage of the integrated recharging unit approach is that the device must be adapted for easy connection to a conventional AC outlet while avoiding the aforementioned problems of electrical prong damage and wear. The present invention is intended to overcome the aforementioned limitations of the prior art by providing an integrated control switch and electrical connector for a rechargeable electrical device according to the appended claim 1. Further advantageous embodiments of the invention, and of a rechargeable device incorporating the invention, are defined by the dependent claims. DE U 1796798 discloses a rechargeable device removably couplable to an associated power source including an housing, first and second prongs for electrically coupling to the associated power source, a recharging circuit, means mounting said prongs on the support housing for movement between a coupling position and a non coupling position and displaceable means on the support housing movable from a first to a second position thereby moving said prongs from the coupling position, between first and second positions, said prongs being moved to and from the coupling position. The earlier publication discloses the prongs and the displaceable means fixed together for common reciprocating movement with the displaceable means being spaced in the direction of reciprocation from the conducting members. The present invention provides an arrangement for covering the prongs when they are in the non coupling position in that the displaceable means in the second position at least partially overlies the prongs in the non coupling position, as is set out in Claim 1. Examples of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a partially cutaway lateral view of a flashlight 12 having a casing 11 and incorporating a three position switch 10 in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. While the three position switch 10 is described herein for use in a flashlight 12, the present invention is not limited to such an application and is compatible with virtually any electrical device which employs a rechargeable battery. The flashlight 12 includes a forward, expanded portion 14 and an aft, elongated portion 16 of the flashlight casing 11. Positioned within an elongated slot 16A on an upper, flat surface 16B of the aft, elongated portion 16 of the casing 11 is the three position switch 10. A forward portion of the elongated portion 16 of the casing 11 is integral with the forward, expanded portion 14. Respective lateral surfaces of the forward, expanded portion 14 are provided with right and left mounting sleeves 18A, 18B. As used hereinafter, right and left refer to various portions of the flashlight 12 and three position switch 10 with the combination viewed from the rear, i.e., from the right as viewed in FIGS. 1 and 2. Positioned on the front of the forward, expanded portion 14 of the casing 11 is a rim, or bezel 18 which includes right and left mounting shoulders 14A, 14B. The right and left mounting shoulders 14A, 14B are adapted to be respectively inserted in a tight fitting manner within the right and left mounting sleeves 18A, 18B of the forward, expanded portion 14 of the casing 11. It is in this manner that the rim 18 may be removably attached to the front of the flashlight 12. The rim 18 is adapted to maintain a lens not shown in position in the front of the flashlight 12. Referring to FIGS. 3 and 6 the three position switch 10 includes a slide assembly 30 positioned upon and linearly displaceable along a support housing 31. The slide assembly 30 rests upon an upper portion of the support housing 31 and is freely displaceable therealong, with right and left slide assembly lateral walls 33A, 33B in contact with respective lateral portions of the support housing 31 in order to maintain proper alignment between the slide assembly 30 and the support housing 31. The support housing 31 is firmly positioned upon a printed circuit board 32 in a manner described below. An upper surface of the slide assembly 30 is provided with a plurality of parallel grooves 30A to facilitate manual engagement and displacement of the slide assembly 30. The right and left slide assembly lateral walls 33A, 33B are respectively provided with right and left switch contact mounts 34A, 34B. Each of the switch contact mounts 34A, 34B extends outward from a respective lateral wall of the slide assembly 30 and is adapted to engage and hold a respective flexible, conductive switch contact 36A, 36B. Each of the switch contacts 36A and 36B includes forward and aft lower resilient portions 36C, 36D, as shown in FIG. 6 for the left switch contact 36B, which extend downward from the slide assembly 30 and are positioned in contact with respective conductive strips on the upper surface of the circuit board 32 as described below. In addition, each of the right and left switch contacts 36A, 36B includes a respective retention finger 49A, 49B for respectively engaging the right and left switch contact mounts 34A, 34B in providing for the stable positioning of a switch contact thereon. Positioned on respective aft, inner portions of the slide assembly lateral walls 33A, 33B are right and left switch detent inserts 35A, 35B. Right and left slots 28A, 28B in the right and left slide assembly lateral walls 33A, 33B provide flexibility in the respective aft portions of the slide assembly lateral walls on which the switch detent inserts 35A, 35B are positioned. The switch detent inserts 35A, 35B are adapted to be positioned within various pairs of detents located in the upper, lateral portions of the switch support housing 31. The various pairs of detents on the switch support housing 31 are the forward, or ON, position detents 37A, 37B, the intermediate, or OFF, position detents 38A, 38B, and the aft, or CHARGE, position detents 39A, 39B. Thus, when the slide assembly 30 is in the full forward position, the switch 10 in the ON position with the slide assembly 30 in an intermediate position, the switch 10 is in the OFF position and with the slide assembly 30 in the full aft position, the switch 10 is in the CHARGE position. The various electrical coupling arrangements which provide for these various operating states are described below. The combination of the various inserts and position detents provide a tactile indication to the switch operator of the position of the switch 10 and reduce the possibility of inadvertent movement of the slide assembly 30 on the switch support housing 31. The circuit board 32 is generally flat and includes various circuit components on one or both sides thereof. The circuit board 32 is positioned within the flashlight 12 and rests upon and is supported by right and left mounting tabs 16C positioned on respective inner, lateral portions of the aft, elongated portion 16 of the flashlight casing 11. Positioned on respective forward and aft upper portions of the switch support housing 31 are forward and aft positioning shoulders 40, 41. The forward and aft positioning shoulders 40, 41 are adapted to engage in tight fitting relation respective forward and aft portions of the slot 16A in the upper surface of the flashlight 12 within which the three position switch 10 is inserted. This arrangement ensures stable positioning of the switch 10 within the flashlight 12. Rotationally positioned within the support housing 31 and aligned generally transverse to its longitudinal direction is a shaft, or axle, 42. Securely mounted to respective end portions of the rotating shaft 42 are right and left cams 45A, 45B. Securely coupled to respective right and left intermediate portions of the rotating shaft 42 are parallel, elongated right and left prongs, or AC contacts, 44A, 44B. The right and left cams 45A, 45B positioned on respective ends of the rotating shaft 42 extend slightly beyond the lateral portions of the switch support housing 31. Included in the right and left slide assembly lateral walls 33A, 33B are right and left cam surfaces 47A, 47B. Rearward displacement of the slide assembly 30 from the ON position, illustrated in FIG. 4, along the support housing 31 causes the right and left cam surfaces 47A, 47B to contact and engage the right and left cams 45A, 45B, respectively, causing the angular displacement of the cams 45A, 45B and the rotating shaft 42 to which each is coupled. With the right and left prongs 44A, 44B coupled to intermediate right and left portions of the shaft 42, rotation of the shaft 42 will cause a corresponding angular displacement in the right and left prongs 44A, 44B. Thus, when the slide assembly 30 is disposed in its CHARGE position, illustrated in FIG. 5, the right and left prongs 44A, 44B will be angularly displaced upward through respective right and left slots 29A, 29B within an upper portion of the switch support housing 31 and are oriented generally perpendicular to the upper surface thereof. In this position the prongs 44A, 44B may be inserted in a conventional AC outlet for charging of the rechargeable battery see FIG. 10 in the flashlight 12, as described below. Following recharging of the battery with the slide assembly 30 in the full aft or CHARGE position, the slide assembly 30 may be displaced forward along the support housing 31 such that right and left forward slots 27A, 27B in the slide assembly 30 become aligned with and engage the right and left prongs 44A, 44B, respectively. Further forward displacement of the slide assembly 30 to the OFF position will cause angular displacement of the prongs 44A, 44B and rotation of the shaft 42 to which they are mounted. In this manner, the right and left prongs 44A, 44B may be repositioned within the switch support housing 31 following charging of the rechargeable battery in the flashlight 12. This feature of the three position switch 10 of the present invention is described in greater detail below. Referring to FIG. 4, a mounting insert 58 is positioned generally at the junction of the forward, expanded and aft, elongated portions 14, 16 of the casing 11. The center of the mounting insert 58 includes a recessed portion having an aperture therein within which is inserted a light bulb 57. Positioned within the forward portion 14 of the casing 11 and maintained therein by means of ring 18 see FIGS. 1 and 2 is a concave reflector 56. The reflector 56 is maintained in abutting contact with the light bulb 57 and the mounting insert 58 by means of the ring 18. The light bulb 57 includes first and second terminals 57A and 57B. The first terminal 57A is coupled to the circuit board 32 via a positive lead 59, while the light bulb s second terminal 57B is coupled to neutral ground potential on the circuit board 32 via a negative lead 60. Applying a DC voltage across the light bulb 57 via positive and negative leads 59, 60 causes the illumination of the light bulb 57. A center, lower portion of the switch support housing 31 includes forward and aft pairs of mounting inserts 31A, 31B received in mounting slots 32A, 32B in the circuit board 32 FIGS. 4, 7 and 8 , with the inserts 31A being inserted in the slots 32A and the inserts 31B being inserted in the slots 32B. An aft mounting slot 25 is positioned on the rear edge of the circuit board 32 and receives therein an aft mounting insert 26 located on a rear portion of the switch support housing 31. Insertion of the various mounting inserts on the lower portion of the switch support housing 31 into the various mounting slots in the circuit board 32 maintains the switch support housing 31 securely in position upon an upper surface of the circuit board 32. From FIGS. 4, 5, 8 and 9, it can be seen that when the switch slide assembly 30 is moved toward the rear of the flashlight, or to the right in FIGS. 4 and 5, the cam surfaces 47A and 47B, respectively contact the cams 45A and 45B mounted on the rotating shaft 42. Further rearward displacement of the slide assembly 30 results in the clockwise rotational displacement of the combination of the rotating shaft 42 and the cams 45A and 45B. The prongs 44A and 44B are coupled to an intermediate portion of the shaft 42 by means of coupling assemblies 43A and 43B see FIG. 9 and rotate therewith. Thus, when the cams 45A and 45B are displaced downward by means of the cam surfaces 47A and 47B on the slide assembly 30, the combination of the shaft 42, the coupling assemblies 43A and 43B, and the prongs 44A and 44B is rotated clockwise such that the prongs 44A and 44B are oriented generally perpendicular to the upper surface of the switch support housing 31. Also positioned on intermediate portions of the rotating shaft 42 and in electrical contact with respective right and left prongs 44A, 44B are right and left electrical contacts 46A, 46B. With the prongs 44A and 44B oriented generally vertically as shown in FIG. 5, the electrical contacts 46A and 46B are positioned in abutting contact with respective contact strips on the upper surface of the circuit board 32. These contact strips are shown as elements 50 in FIGS. 5, 7 and 9 and each is positioned within a respective slot 61 within circuit board 32. With the prongs 44A, 44B oriented generally vertically, the right and left electrical contacts 46A, 46B coupled thereto abut respective contact strips 50 and deflect them downward through a respective slot 61 as shown in FIG. 9. When the prongs 44A and 44B are coupled to a power source, such as a conventional AC outlet, a current path is provided via the electrical contacts 46A, 46B and the circuit board 32 to the rechargeable battery 55 for the charging thereof. When charging of the battery 55 is complete, the slide assembly 30 is displaced forward along the support housing 31 to either an intermediate OFF position or to a full forward ON position, shown in FIG. 4. In the full forward position, the forward and aft lower resilient portions 36C and 36D of the right and left switch contacts 36A, 36B bridge respective slots 81A and 81B in forward, lateral portions of the circuit board 32 as shown in FIG. 4. The locations of both the right and left forward circuit board slots 81A, 81B are also shown in FIG. 7. The conductive path between the battery 55 and the flashlight bulb 57 afforded by the conducting strips 76A and 76B is normally interrupted by the slots 81A and 81B so that the bulb 57 is deenergized. The right and left switch contacts 36A, 36B bridge respective forward circuit board slots 81A, 81B when the slide assembly 30 is in the full forward, or ON, position so as to couple respective forward and aft portions of the right and left conducting strips 76A and 76B positioned on an upper surface of the circuit board 32, thereby to energize the bulb 57. The combination of the forward circuit board slots 81A, 81B and the forward and aft lower resilient portions of the right and left switch contacts 36A, 36B prevents solder tracking along the respective right and left conductive strips 76A and 76B. When the switch side assembly 30 is displaced forward along the support housing 31, right and left slots 27A, 27B located in a forward portion of the slide assembly 30 respectively engage right and left prongs 44A, 44B and displace the prongs downward, or in a counterclockwise direction, as viewed in FIGS. 4 and 5, about the axis of rotating shaft 42. As shown in FIG. 4, in this position the right and left prongs 44A, 44B are completely enclosed within the switch support housing 31 and are no longer coupled in circuit with the circuit board 32. The downward displacement and retraction of the prongs 44A and 44B occurs when the slide assembly 30 is in the intermediate OFF position as well as in the full forward ON position, shown in FIG. 4. When the slide assembly 30 is in the full forward position, counterclockwise rotation of the prongs 44A and 44B is terminated when they contact respective right and left rotational stops 48 one shown positioned on respective forward, lateral portions of the support housing 31. As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the battery 55 is provided with at least one terminal 55A on a forward portion thereof which is coupled in circuit with the circuit board 32. The battery 55 may thus be recharged via the AC contact prongs 44A, 44B and the circuit board 32 or may discharge via the combination of circuit board 32 and right left switch contacts 36A, 36B for illuminating the light bulb 57. Referring to FIG. 7, there is shown a top plan view of the circuit board 32 upon which the three position switch 10 of the present invention may be mounted and by means of which the rechargeable battery 55 is coupled to the flashlight s light bulb 57 and to the electrical prongs 44A and 44B not shown in FIG. 7 . As previously described, the circuit board 32 includes right and left conducting strips 76A, 76B positioned on an upper surface and along a lateral edge thereof. Each of the conducting strips 76A, 76B is interrupted by means of a respective slot 81A, 81B in order to prevent solder tracking by the displacement of the electrical contacts 36A, 36B along the conducting strips 76A, 76B. Solder tracking could cause the unintended turn on of the flashlight 12, and the slots 81A and 81B are intended to prevent this. The location of the right and left switch contacts 36A, 36B for various operating positions of the switch are shown in dotted line form in FIG. 7. For example, positions 78A and 78B indicate the location of the switch contacts 36A, 36B along the respective conducting strips 76A, 76B when the three position switch 10 is in the ON position. Similarly, locations 79A and 79B represent the position of the switch contacts 36A, 36B along the right and left conducting strips 76A, 76B when the three position switch 10 is in the OFF position. Finally, locations 80A and 80B along the right and left conducting strips 76A, 76B represent the position of the electrical switch contacts 36A, 36B when the three position switch 10 is in the CHARGE position. The circuit board 32 contemplated for use in the present invention is of conventional design and therefore would generally include a substrate 75 upon which are positioned the right and left conducting strips 76A, 76B, which in a preferred embodiment would be comprised of copper. Also positioned in circuit with the AC contact strips 50 is a charging circuit 77 which, for simplicity sake, is merely shown as a block in FIG. 7. The charging circuit 77 couples the AC contact strips 50 to the battery terminal 55A and would typically include a rectifier, a voltage regulation circuit, and other conventional circuitry for coupling the AC input to the battery 55. Also positioned on either the upper or lower surface of the circuit board 32 would be other circuitry of a conventional nature for coupling the battery 55 to the light bulb 57 for the illumination thereof. The configuration and operation of the various circuitry positioned upon the circuit board 32 for providing for the recharging of battery 55 and the proper operation of the electrical device with which the three position switch 10 and the battery 55 operate may be conventional in nature, does not form a part of the present invention, and is not, therefore, discussed further herein. Additional details of the mounting of the left switch contact 36B within the left switch contact mount 34B can be seen in FIG. 8. A sectional view of the upper portion of the switch contact 36B shows that it is generally L shaped with the forward and aft lower resilient portions 36C, 36D extending downward from a horizontal portion thereof. Also from FIG. 8, it can be seen how the rotating shaft 42 is retained within the support housing 31 by means of the forward and aft mounting inserts 31A, 31B, between which the shaft 42 is rotationally mounted. Also from FIG. 8, it can be seen that cams 45A, 45B are coupled to and integral with respective right and left coupling assemblies 43A, 43B which, in turn, are mounted on respective ends of the rotating shaft 42 and to which are securely coupled the right and left prongs 44A, 44B. The left prong rotational stop 48B is shown disposed on a lower, forward, inner portion of the left lateral wall of the switch support housing 31. In FIG. 9, the right and left electrical contacts 46A, 46B electrically coupled to the right and left prongs 44A, 44B are shown in contact with a respective one of the contact strips 50 on the circuit board 32. Each of the contact strips 50 is deflected downward by means of a respective electrical contact 46A, 46B for coupling the rechargeable battery 55 in circuit with the AC contact prongs 44A and 44B. Referring to FIG. 10, there is illustrated a standard wall receptacle fixture 90 having two outlets 91 and 92, each comprising a pair of sockets 93. The receptacle fixture 90 has a common arrangement, wherein the sockets 93 of each pair thereof are spaced apart in a direction perpendicular to the direction of alignment of the two outlets 91 and 92. Since the prongs 44A and 44B of the switch 10 are spaced apart in a direction perpendicular to the direction of elongation of the flashlight 12, this means that when the prongs 44A and 44B are plugged into one of the outlets 91 or 92, the flashlight 12 will also block the other outlet, as indicated in FIG. 10. In order to avoid this condition, there is also provided an alternative embodiment of the flashlight of the present invention, generally designated by the numeral 95 and illustrated in FIG. 11, arranged so that the switch prongs thereof are spaced apart in the direction of elongation of the flashlight 95, so that when the flashlight 95 is plugged into one of the outlets 91 or 92, the other outlet will not be blocked, as best illustrated in FIG. 11. The flashlight 95 is substantially identical to the flashlight 12, except for the three position switch. Therefore, common parts of the flashlights 12 and 95 are indicated by the same reference numerals. Referring now to FIGS. 12 through 17, the flashlight 95 includes a three position switch 100, which is similar to the switch 10 and includes a support housing 110. The support housing 110 has a flat, generally rectangular top wall 111, bounded on the opposite sides thereof by a pair of side walls 112, each of which projects a predetermined distance upwardly above the top wall 111. The side walls 112 are interconnected, at one end thereof by a rear end wall 113, and a predetermined distance from the front end thereof by a depending front wall 114. An upstanding front wall 115 is integral with the top wall 111 at the front edge thereof and interconnects the side walls 112. Integral with the front wall 115 at its forward end and projecting forwardly therefrom is a ledge 116 which is parallel to the top wall 111. Integral with the ledge 116 at its forward end is a forwardly extending attachment flange 117. Formed in the top wall 111 is an elongated rectangular opening 118 having a downwardly and rearwardly beveled rear edge 119 see FIG. 13 . In use, the support housing 110 is mounted in the elongated slot 16A in the elongated portion 16 of the flashlight casing 11, with the upper surface of the ledge 116 being substantially coplanar with the surface 16B, and with the attachment flange 117 being disposed beneath the outer wall of the forward portion 14 of the casing 11. The three position switch 100 also includes a printed circuit board 120 which is substantially similar to the circuit board 32, described above, except that the circuit board 120 has slots 121 in place of the slots 61 and is provided with contact stripe 122 in place of the contact strips 50, the contact strips 122 projecting rearwardly into the slots 121, as can best be seen in FIGS. 13 and 16. The three position switch 100 also includes a prong assembly 130 which includes a shaft 131 mounted in the support housing 110 for rotation about an axis extending laterally between the side walls 112. Integral with the shaft 131 at the opposite ends thereof are two cams 132, similar to the cams 45A and 45B, described above. The shaft 131 has a reduced diameter central portion 133 to which is secured a spacer block 135. The prong assembly 130 also includes a pair of prongs 140 spaced apart by the spacer block 135 longitudinally of the support housing 110. Each of the prongs 140 has a relatively wide outer or distal end portion 141, coupled at its inner end by an offset portion 142 to a reduced width inner end portion 143. Each inner end portion 143 is integral with an angled flange 144 of still further reduced width which is inclined downwardly towards the opposite one of the prongs 140, extending beneath the central portion 133 of the shaft 131. Each angled flange 144 is provided at its distal end with an upturned tip 145, the junction therebetween defining a rounded contact portion 146. Integral with the rearward one of the prongs 140 projecting from the inner end of the inner end portion 143 parallel thereto is a cover plate 147, having a beveled end 148. In use, the prong assembly 130 is pivotally movable about the axis of the shaft 131 between an extended use position, illustrated in solid line in FIG. 13, and a retracted non use position, illustrated in FIG. 14. When the prong assembly 130 is in its extended use position, the prongs 140 project outwardly from the casing 11 in position to be plugged into an outlet 91 or 92 of a receptacle fixture 90. In this position, the contact portions 146 respectively engage the contact strips 122 on the circuit board 120, deflecting them downwardly, and providing an electrical connection between the associated AC source and the charging circuit 77, as described above. In this position also, the distal end of the cover plate 147 is accommodated in the slot 121 in the circuit board 120. When the prong assembly 130 is disposed in its retracted position, the prongs 140 are out of contact with the contact strips 122 and are fully received within the support housing 110. In this position, the upper one of the prongs 140 cooperates with the cover plate 147 to close the opening 118 in the top wall 111 of the support housing 110, the beveled end 148 of the cover plate 147 mating with the beveled rear edge 119 of the opening 118. The three position switch 100 also includes a slide assembly 150, which is substantially similar to the slide assembly 30, described above, and having switch contacts 36A and 36B and cam surfaces 154. The slide assembly 150 operates in the same manner as the slide assembly 30 described above, being longitudinally slidably movable along the support housing 110 among a rearward CHARGE position, illustrated in FIG. 13, a full forward ON position, illustrated in broken line in FIG. 14, and an intermediate OFF position, illustrated in solid line in FIG. 14. As the slide assembly 150 is moved forwardly from its CHARGE position, its forward end engages the rearmost one of the prongs 140, thereby driving the prong assembly 130 into pivotal movement about the axis of the shaft 131 in a counterclockwise direction, as viewed in FIG. 13, to its fully retracted non use position. The slide assembly 150 in its OFF position substantially covers the prong assembly 130 in its retracted position. As the slide assembly 150 is moved from its OFF position to its ON position, the switch contacts 36A and 36B close a circuit between the battery 55 and the lamp bulb 57, in the same manner as was described above in connection with the flashlight 12. When the slide assembly 150 is moved rearwardly from its OFF position, the cam surfaces 154 engage the cams 132 for camming the prong assembly 130 into clockwise pivotal movement upwardly to its extended use position. Because the outer end portions 141 of the prongs 140 lie in parallel planes which are spaced apart in the direction of elongation of the flashlight casing 11, they can be inserted in one of the outlets 91 or 92 of the receptacle fixture 90, without the flashlight 95 interfering with the other one of the outlets, as illustrated in FIG. 11. There has thus been shown a multi position slidable switch particularly adapted for use in an electrical device having a rechargeable battery. A first, full forward position electrically couples the battery to the device for the operation thereof. A second, intermediate position turns the device off. A third, full aft position puts the rechargeable battery in circuit with a pair of electrical prongs for coupling to a power source, such as a conventional AC outlet, for the charging of the battery. In the first and second positions, the AC contact prongs are fully retracted within the switch assembly, while in the third, charge position the prongs extend from the switch to facilitate their insertion in a conventional power source. Two prong arrangements are provided to permit the device to be plugged into one outlet of a two outlet receptacle, without blocking the other outlet.
