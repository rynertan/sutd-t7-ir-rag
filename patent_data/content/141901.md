## Description
FIELD OP THE INVENTION The present invention relates to improvement of the physical properties of polyurethanes. Polyols having characteristics tailored to the production ot improved polyurethanes are provided. More specifically, the present invention relates to novel modified polyols, designated hereinafter as adducts, which are useful reactants for producing a wide variety of synthetic plastic and elastic products.The adducts of the invention may be used, for example, to produce cellular products, films, coatings, and cast or molded articles, such as, but not limited to, polyurethanes. Where cellular or microporous articles are produced, significant improvements may be obtained in the load boaring characteristics, tensile strength, and stability of cell structure of the foams. In one particularly useful aspect of the invention, the adducts are employed in the production of polyurethanes, especially cellular polyurethanes. Cellular polyurethane foams constitute a broad class of polymeric materials having physical characteristics ranging from rigid to elastic rubbery structure. The polymers are produced through the interaction of a polyfunctional isocyanate with a polyfunctional chemical compound having an active hydrogen in its structure such as a polyester, polyesteramide, polyether or a mixture of two or more such materials.The active hydrogensontainin material is generally a liquid, or a solid capable of being melted at a relatively low temperature. The materials conventionally used contain hydroxyl groups as the radicals having the active hydrogen and are generally termed polyols. Despite Ute variety of physical and chemical properties obtainable by proper selection ol the polyisocyanate and the polyol as well as by controlling the. conditions under which the reaction is carried out, there are definite lImitations in selecting components for oPtimization of desirable properties in the resulting product.One of the most significant of such limitations arises from the fact that the polyol must be Sufficiently liquid at the appropriate reaction temperature to permit mixing and reaction with the polyfunctional isocyanate In producing a polyurethane resin. This requirement generally results in the use of polyols of relatively low molecular weight. However, the utility of polyols of low molecular weight is generally limited to producing rigid products. The Use of higher molecular weight components is attended by a variety of other difficulties including handling and compounding problems. For example, polyol viscosity may be excessively high. One known technique for producing polyurethanes with better propertIes incorporating higher molecular weight components while minimizing the disadvantages mentioned above, involves employing polymer polyors in place of or in conjunction with simple polyols for reaction with polyisocyanates to produce polyurethanes. However, the stability of polymer polyols generally decreases with decreasing molecular weight of the polyols used to make them, and it is difficult to avoid using relatively low molecular weight polyols for the reasons discussed above. Instability of polymer polyols may lead to breakdown of the polymer polyol dispersion during preparation and storage, resulting in coagulation. As is known in the art, it is not possible to make acceptable products with coagulated polymer polyols, because mixing and homogeneous reaction of tht reactants cannot practicably be achieved. Also, among the polymer polyols of greatest commercial significance have been those formed as reaction products of styrene, acrylonitrile and a polyoL There are several potential disadvantages to such systems. It is known that polymers containing acrylonitrile as a major component tend to become discolored during cure, probably because of the exothermic nature of the reaction during polyurethane formation.It is also known that styrene, when substituted for a major portion ot the acrylonitrile, will prevent discoloration. However, it is normally difficult to employ high styrene acrylonitrile ratios because the stability of reaction mixtures containing polymerZpolyoWPgeneralky decreases withIncreasing styrene content. The instability similarly can lead to difficulties in making the polymer polyol dispersion or in breakdown after the polymer polyol dispersion is made, resulting in coagulation. As a consequence of the above difficulties, commercial operations have often been constrained to using relatively high acrylonitriie styrene ratios and making products in which foam discoloration was not an important consideration. It would be desirable to provide improved techniques for producing polyurethane foams incorporating higher molecular weight components, while avoiding problems such as foam discoloration and coagulation of the polymer polyol dispersions. Incorporation of higher molecular weight components in the reaction mixtures would lead to higher indentation load bearing capacity hereinafter ILD , tensile strength hereinafter TES , and flexibility of the final products, the benefits of such improved properties being well known in the art.Improvements in these important foam properties in turn would permit reduction of the foam density needed to achieve a given level of foam strength e.g., ItD and TES , permitting reduction In the amount of polymer needed to produce a slab of foam having a given size, as well as reducing the unit volume weight of the product. In view of the widespread use of polyurethane foam materials in automobiles, and the current pressure to reduce the weight of automobile components wherever possible, production of polyurethane foams having a given ILD and TES at reduced weight is an important continuing goal in the polyurethane industry. THe products discussed above should be useful in other fields as well, such as in the production of slab stock for use by the furniture industry in seat cushions, mattresses and a variety of other products. The adducts of the invention and polymer polyols optionally prepared from them may be advantageously employed to improve other types of products besides polyurethane foams, including but not limited to solid polyurethane products, and polyester products. Articles with improved physical properties e.g., ILD and TES may be produced by the practice of the invention directly without the use of polyntier polyols. Additionally, when incorporated in polymer polyols the adducts are believed to act M protective colloids, preventing aggfomeratfon of polymer particles and thus adverting coagulation. Improvements in the ultimate products can be expected, since improvements in the stability of polymer polyols will produce more uniform products, with better physical properties.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART The basic polymer polyol technology is disclosed inU.S. Reissue 28,715 and U.S. Reissue 29,118. U.S. Reissue 29,118 discloses polymer polyols comprising O a relatively high molecular weight tilm4orming polymer having radicals which are reactive with the eX C O radicals of the isocyanate used to form the polyurethane, and 2 a reactive solvent such as a polyol which is a solvent or dispersing medium for the polymer, and which also contains radicals which are reactive with the isoeyanato group. The list of reactive monomers to be polymerized in situ in the polyol reactive solvent includes Itaconic acid, maleic acid and fumaric acid.However, Reissue patent 29,118 fails to specify the production of adducts by reaction of these carboxylic acids with the polyoL For example, the patent does not discuss the benefits obtainable by incorporating half esters In polymer polyols. Halfesters comprise adducts formed by reaction between a polyol and a polycarboxylic acid or anhydride, having a substantial percentage of free carboxyl groups based on the total amount of carboxylic carbon atoms in the acid or anhydride which was used .While examples 49 and 50 disclose the use of polyesters having acid numbers of 44 and 11 respectively for producing polymer polyols, there is no reference to the importance of polyol dibasic carboxylic acid adducts having acid numbers corresponding to half esters, especially acid numbers ranging from about 12 to 7, nor is there any suggestion of using these products to produce polyurethanes directly without first incorporating them in polymer polyols.Also, the polyesters in Reissue 29,118 Examples 49 and 50 were produced by reaction of a dibasic carboxylic acid with a very low molecular weIght glycol ethylene glyeol rather than a polyol as defined In and necessary for practice under the present invention. Polyols according to the invention must have an average molecular weight of at least about 500 grams per mole, preferably at least about 1,000 grams per mole, in order to produce adducts and po1ymeryols of acceptable Quality, Reissue 28,715 contains similar disclosure seeExamples 46 and 47 . V.S. Patent 3,953,393 discloses the production of polymerpolyols which may be used to produce polyurethanes, such as polyurethane foams, by the in situ polymerization of a vinyl monomer In an unsaturated polyol In the presence of a free radical catalyst. The unsaturated polyol may be prepared by reaction of any conventional polyol with an organic compound having both ethylenic unsaturation and a hydroxyl, carboxyl or epoxy group.The organic compounds which can be used include saturated polycarboxylic acids and anhydrides such as maleic acid and anhydride, fumaric acid and anhydride, crotonic anhydride, propenyl succinic anhydride, halogenated maleic acids and anhydrides, and unsaturated epoxides such as l vinylcyclohexane 3,4 epoxide, butadiene monoxide, vinyl glycidyl ether, glycidyl methacrylate and allyl glycidyl ether. The patent discloses that where polycarboxylic acids are used, it is necessary to react any remaining free carboxylic acid groups with an alkylene oxide after forming the modified polyoL It is stated that the final acid number of the modified polyol should be less than or equal to one. Other patents of similar relevance include U.S. 3,652,639 U.S. 3,950,317 and U.S.Reissue 29,014U.S. 3,931,450 , U.S. 4,014,846 , and U.S. 4,093,573 are of similar relevance except that they indicate that neutralization of free carboxyl groups is preferred rather than necessary. U.S. 4,144,395 6 is particularly related to the production of polyether ester polyols prepared by reaction of an alkylene oxide, a polyether polyol and a polycarboxylic acid anhydride.The amount of alkylene oxide employed is such that the acid number of the productEMI5.1 is reduced to 5 or less, and preferably to 1 or less. discloses half ester adducts produced bw the reaction of a polyol with aEMI5.2 polycarboxylic acid annyoride, but also teaches that suen nalr ester adducts are merely intermediates which must be reacted with an alkylene oxide to reduce the KOH value at least to 5 or less and preferably to 1 or less.Murphy teaches against any use of a half ester adduct to produce polyurethane products, either directly by reaction with a polyisocyanate, or indirectly by incorporation In a polymer polyol followed by reaction of the adduct containing polymer polyol with a polyisocyanate. See similarly U.S. Patent 3,459,733 U.S. Patent 3,585,185 U.S. Patent 3,639,541 and U.S. Patent 3,639,542 Other patents which disclose producing adducts of a polyol and a polycarboxylic acid, which then are reacted with an epoxide to yield an adduct in which substantially all free carboxyl groups are neutralized, include Japanese Kokal 48 101494 73, Japanese Kokai 48 101498 73, BritishPatent 1,126,025, and British Patent 1,217,005. Japanese Patent 52 005887 Laid Open No. 5887 1977 , discloses production of a modified polyol by reacting a mixture of a saturated dibasic carboxylic acid and an unsaturated dibasic carboxylic acid with a polyol, in which the molar ratio of the saturated dibasic carboxylic acld to the unsaturated dibasic carboxylic acid ranges from 95 5 toS0 50, to produce a flpolyester.W The modified polyol may be used to produce a polymer polyol, which then can be used to produce a polyurethane foam. There is no discussion of acid numbers except in the Examples, which indicate that the carboxyl groups in the final products were nearly completely neutralized. Another patent, U.S. 4,148,840 which is of general relevance to the polymer polyol art, Includes a statement which refers to Japanese Patent 52 005887 column 10, lines 20 26 . Neither the meaning nor the accuracy of this statement is clear. V.S. Patent 4,198,488 discloses polymer polyols produced as reaction products of 1 an organic polyol and 2 an interpolymer of a minor amount of polymerized ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid anhydride, such as maleic anhydride, and a major amount of at least one different polymerized ethylenically unsaturated monomer. It is stated that polyurethane foams may be produced. The patent notes that acid numbers in the polymer polyols in excess of about 1.5 are undesirable. While the above discussed prior art has In general disclosed reaction products of polyols with polycarboxylic acids and anhydrlda, there appears to be no prior. art discussion of the incorporation in polymer polyols and polyurethanes of half ester adducts in which at least one of .the carboxylic carbon atoms remains unreacted. To the contrary, the prior art uniformly teaches that neutralization of reacted carboxyl groups is preferred, If not required.The prior art also has failed to disclose the utility of half ester adducts both for direct production of polymerized products I.e., by reaction with a polyisocyanate and expanding by conventional techniques to produce a polyurethane foam , or for incorporation Into useful polymer polyols which can be similarly used to produce, e.g., polyurethane foam products. U.S. Patent 2,996,551 discloses adducts produced by first reacting a polyol with a monoepoxide such as propylene oxide to produce an intermediate, and then reacting the intermediate with a polyepoxide. While the patent notes that the products can be used as active OH reactants, neither polyurethanes nor polyurethane foams are mentioned. Also, there is no disclosure of reacting a polyol with a polyepoxide in such a manner that at least one of the epoxy groups remain wireacted. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION jt has been found, according to the present invention, that improved high molecular weight elastic, plastic, cellular and microcellular products including polyurethane products, and in particular polyurethane foams, may be produced by employing and incorporating as an agent for coreaction with a polyisocyanate, the specially produced adduct of the invention. In some embodiments it may be preferable to employ an adduct which is not itself reactive with the polyisocyanate, but which nevertheless acts during the polyurethane formation reaction, as a protective colloid, preventing coagulation of reaction mixtures to Improve the properties of the product.The adducts of the invention, which will be discussed in detail below, may be combined in undiluted form directly with a polyisocyanate and optionally another polyol to produce a polyurethane.

In one embodiment of the invention, adducts are produced by reacting A a polyol, and B at least one compound selected from the group consisting of dicarboxylic acids and anhydrides, polycarboxylic acids having more than two carboxylic carbon atoms and the correspondiiig anhydrides, and epoxides including diepoxides and polyepoxides having more than two epoxy groups. A wide range of polyols and the Uke can be used. Among the polyols which can be employed are one or more polyols from the following classes of compositions. Minor amounts of polyhydroxyalkanes can be present . b Hydroxyl terminated polyesters b Alkylene oxides of polyhydroxyalkanes c Trialkanolamines and alkylene oxide adducts thereof d Alcohols derived from mono and polyamines by addition ot alkylene oxides e Non reducing sugars and sugar derivatives and alkylene oxide adducts thereof f Alkylene oxide adducts of aromatic amine phenol aldehyde condensation products g Allcylene oxide adducts of phosphorus and polyphosphorus acids 01 Polyphenols and alkylene oxide adducts thereof i Polytetramethylene glycols PartIcularly preferred polyols include poly oxypropylene glycols, triols and higher functionality polyols, poly oxybutylene glycols, triols and higher functionality polyols, and poly oxypropylene oxyethylene polyols, similarly including glycols, triols and higher functionality polyols. In the latter class of polyols, the oxyethylene content of th e polyol is preferably less than 80 , most preferably less than 60 of the totaL When used, ethylene oxide can be Included in any fashion along the polyol molecule chairs, i.e., as internal blocks, terminal blocks, and or in random patterns. Limited unsaturation in the polyol used does not adversely affect the operation of the Invention, unless the polyol has so much unsaturation that it is In the form of a highly cross linked polymer or geL The polyols employed can have hydroxyl numbers whIch vary over ide range. In general, the hydroxyl numbers of the polyols employed can range from 20, and lower, to 400, and higher, preferably from . 30 to e 300, and most preferably, from . 35 to 200. The hydroxyl number is defined as the number of milligrams of potassium hydroxide required for the complete hydrolysis of the fully acetylated derivative prepared from 1 gram of polyoL The hydroxyl number can also be computed by the equation 56.1. 1000. F M.W. where OH hydroxyl number of the polyol P w functionality average number of hydroxyl groups per molecule of polyol M.W. molecular weight of the polyot The exact polyol employed depends upon the end use of the polyurethane product to be produced. For example, in the case of foamed reaction products, the hydroxyl number is selected properly to result in flexible, semiflexibile, or rigid foams. The above polyols preferably possess a hydroxy number of from 200 to 400 when employed in rigid foam formulations, from 70 to 150 for semiflexible foams, and from 20 to 70 when employed in flexible foam formulations. Such limits are not intended to be restrictive, but are merely Illustrative of preferred polyols for particular applications. The average molecular weight of the polyols used can range from 500 grams per mole up to 9,000 grams per mole or more preferably the average molecular weight rsnges from 1,000 4,000 grams per mole. Polyol average molecular weight has great influence on the character of the end products. The nexibility of polyurethane foams increases as the polyol molecular weight increases. As the polyol molecular weight decreases, more polyisocyanate Is needed to produce an acceptable foam. Compounds useful as reactants In the present Invention with molettes which are reactive with the polyol include dicarboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acld anhydrides and diepoxides. These compounds may be aliphatic, cyclic or aromatic, and may be saturated or unsaturated.Compounds having more than two funetionalities such as tricarbexylic acids and triepoxides may also be used. Compounds having two or more functionalities reactive with the hydroxyl groups of the polyol and additionally having one or more hydroxyl groups, such as hydroxycarboxylic acids, may also be used. It is theorized that reactions occur between the polyol and the reactive compound or compounds which are combined with It. In the case of dicarboxylic acids and anhydrides this has been substantiated using infrared spectroscopy and NMR nuclear magnetic resonance .However, the potyol and co reactant may also interact to produce a protective colloid which may not strictly be a single reaction product. Carboxylic compounds which may be used include, as representative examples, maleic acid, adipic acid, succinic acid, itaconie acid, sebacic acid, phthalic acid, azelaic acid, 4 carboxyheptanedioic acid and the corresponding anhydrides. The anhydrides, in particular maleic anhydride and phthalic anhydride, are preferred. Epoxy compounds which may be used include, as representative examples, 3,4 epoxycyclohexylmethyl 3,4 epoxy cyclohexane carboxylate, 1,4 butanediol diglycidyl ether, vinyl cyclohexene dioxide, bis 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl adipat e, lim onene dioxide, and 2 3 ,4 epoxycyclohexyl 5, 5 spiro 3,4 epoxy cyclohexane m eta dioxane. Limonene dioxide and 3,4epoxycyclohexylmethyl 3,4 epoxy cyclohexane carboxylate are the preferred epoxy compounds for use. Suitable epoxy compounds are commercially available, for example, from the Union Carbide Corporation New York under the trade nameBAKELITE. Additional sources of suitable epoxy compounds Include the Vikirg Chemical Company Minneapolis . The adducts may be produced by reacting the polyol A with the polyol reactive compound. B in a molar ratio ranging from 1 1 to Xs2. The discussion below refers to an exemplary mixture having a 1 1 molar ratIo of hydroxy and carboxy groups. The compound B should be added to the polyol A in a vessel which Is continuously nushed with nitrogen and equipped with stirring means, temperature control, rcnw and heat source. The compound B should be stirred to dissolve it In the polyol at a temperature ranging from 70 to 150 C preferably at 70 to 120 C, and most preferably at about 70 C.The temperature should then be gradually increased to 160 to 180 C, preferably about 170 C. Since extended heating at such temperatures can result in reaction of all reactive functionalities of the compound B , the progress of the reaction is chemically monitored and reaction Is stopped by cooling when the desired stage of reaction is reached. Where carboxylic compounds are used, the reaction is complete when the KOH equivalent of the reaction product, as determined by the KOH titration test to be detailed below, Is reduced by about 1 3 of the original value. This indicates that a half ester has been produced, In which a substantial percentage of the carboxylic carbons of the carboxylic compound have reacted with the polyol but in which a significant percentage also remain unreacted.Where dicarboxylic acids or anhydrides are used, the KOR value should be reduced to below about 16, preferably to between 12 and 7. Acid equivalents higher than about 12 indicate that the dicarboxylic acid or anhydride remains substantially reacted acid equivalents less than about 7 indicate that the second half of the carboxylic carbons of the dicarboxylic acid or anhydride have begun to react with the polyoL Full esters having substantially no free carboxyl groups may be produced as needed in later embodiments detailed below by merely continuing the reaction until the KOH equivalent is reduced substantially to zero. Usually when a dicarboxylic anhydride is allowed to react with a polyol, reaction at 160 180 C for 2 3 hours produces a half ester. The free carboxyl group formed when the anhydride undergoes ring opening does not readily react with the polyol, due to steric hindrance. However, further heating for about 6 additional hours or longer causes the free carboxyl groups to react, yielding a fully esterified product. While there may be cxcess hydroxyl groups in the polyol which remain unreacted, substantially all of the carboxyl carbon atoms from the anhydride are then bound by esterification reaction.Specific reaction times and temperatures required for particular anhydrides to produce half and full esters vary, and the necessary parameters may be readily established by those skilled in the art on a case by case basis. Where epoxides are used as the co reactant, similar procedures may be used and the reaction is complete when a substantial percentage ot the epoxy groups of the epoxide have reacted with the polyol, but where a significant percentage remain unreacted, as determined by the pyiridinium chloride test to be further explained below. These reactions are preferably carried out at a temperature of 70 90C, most preferably about 70 C, for about 10 hours. According to another important embodiment, the adducts are produced as the reaction product of A a polyol and C an intermediate formed as the reaction product of at least one compound B as described above, with at least one low molecular weight polyhydroxyhydrocarbon D . The low molecular weight polyhydroxyhydrocarbon D is preferably a glycol such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or 1,3 butylene glycol.Ethylene glycol and l 3,butylene glycol are the preferred low molecular weight polyhydroxyhydrocarbons. Other low molecular weight polyhydroxyhydrocarbon compounds including diols, triols, quadrols and higher functional polyhydroxyhydrocarbon compounds may also be used. The distinction between the compounds D and the polyols A lies in their respective molecular weights. Whereas the polyols A normally have average molecular weights of 500 to 9,000, the compounds D have exact chemical formulas of molecular weight generally below about 200 grams per mole. In producing the intermediate C , the compound B and the compound D are allowed to react under conditions similar to those set forth above. Preferably, this reaction is carried out at a temperature of . 80 100C, most preferably about 95 C, for about 24 hours.Mter this intermediate C has been produced and, if necessary, subjected to conventional purification steps such as filtering or stripping of superfluous reactants, the intermediate C and the polyol A are reacted to produce an adduct having a low KOH or epoxy equivalent. This reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature of . l60 lS0 C, most preferably about l8O C, for about 10 hours. The polyol and the intermediate are preferably combined in a molar ratio of 1 1. According to yet another embodiment, the adducts are produced the reaction product of A a polyol and E a half ester intermediate formed as the reaction product of l at least one polycarboxylic compound selected from the group consisting of dicarboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acld anhydrides, polycarboxylic acids having at least three carboxylic carbon atoms and polycarboxylic anhydrides having at least three carboxylIc carbon atoms, and 2 at least one epoxy compound selected from the group consisting of diepoxides and polyepoxides having at least three epoxy groups. The polycarboxylic and epoxy compounds mentioned above are suitable for use. To produce the adducts the polycarboxylic and epoxy compounds are allowed to react under conditions similar to those set forth above to produce the half ester intermediate E . These reactions are preferably carried out at a temperature of . 100 140 C preferably about 130iC for about a half hour. The intermediate E is then allowed to react with the polyol as described in the previous embodiment to produce the adduct. The times and temperatures specified above for the various reactions are exemplary but not required. Catalysts may be added to accelerate the reactions, as taught below in the Examples, permitting use of lower temperatures and shorter reaction times. Suitable catalysts are well known in the art. Preferably, the adducts produced according to the above embodiments are diluted with a polyoL An adduct in a reaction mixture for producing a product such as a polyurethane should constitute 2.5 10 by weight, preferably . 5 10 and most preferably about 10 by weight of the composition. The optimum amount in a given ease is best determined by experimentation. Rather than being combined in accordance with the above embodiments directly with a polyisocyanate to produce a polyurethane, the adducts may optionally be incorporated in a polymer polyol which t then combined with a polyisocyanate. Polymer polyols are well kriown In the art. The basle technology Is disclosed in U.S. Reissue 28,715 and U.S. Reissue 29,118.Generally, in order to produce a conventional polymer polyol, an ethylenically unsaturated monomer is polymerized in situ In an appropriate polyoL The polymerization produces a stable, dispersed polymer in the polyoL The polymer dispersion, known as a polymer polyol, can be employed as a reactant in a number of reactions e.g., polyurethaneforming reactions to introduce into the resultant product, as an integral part thereof, both the polyol and the dispersed polymer. More specifically, conventional polymer polyols may be produced by the following steps which are known in the art a Dispersing a minor amount of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer in a major amount of at least one normally liquid polyol having a molecular weight of at least about 500 and a hydroxyl number in the range of 20 to z 600 by feeding the monomer into the polyol at a regular and continuous rate, and b Polymerizing said monomer in said polyol by free radical addition polymerization in the presence of a conventional free radical catalyst to a substantially linear polymer having a molecular weight of at least about 5,00 i to provide a liquid, stable dispersion of polymer polyol having a viscosityEMI17.1 of less than about 40,000 cps at 10 polymer concentration. During this polymerization, a minor amount of graft or block polymer is inherently produced. Thus, regardless of whether or not the ethylenically unsaturated monomer itself contains radicals reactive with the isocyanato group, the reactive compositions produced always contain film forming polymer having radicals reactive with the isoeyanato group.Among ethylenically unsaturated monomers which do not have a radical reactive with the isocyanato group are styrene, methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate however, all of these produce, after polymerization, reactive compositions that contain a Zilm forrning polymer having a minor amount of reactive radicals Introduced from the polymerization medium and the reactive compositions react with the isocyanato group. Preferably, the adduct is diluted significantly with a suitable polyol before addition and polymerization with the ethylenically unsaturated monomer to produce the desired adduct modified polymer polyol. A mixture of. 2.5 to 10 parts, and preferably s 5 to 10 parts by weight of adduct per 100 parts of the total mixture of adduct and polyol for producing the polymer polyol should be used. The optimum percentage to be used in a given case, however, is best determined by experimentation, because factors including the type and molecular weight of the polyol used, and the type and concentration of ethylenically saturated monomers to be used, affect the properties of the product polymer polyols.The adduct, polyol and ethylenieslly unsaturated monomers may be combined in any order, the Important factor being dilution of the adduct by a suitable polyol prior to addition of the polyisocyanate to produce the polyurethane. Preferably, however, the adduct is first diluted with the polyol before mixing with the ethylenically waturated monomers. Polymer polyols may be produced by polymerizing the ethylenically unssturated monomers in the selected polyol at a temperature of from t00C to 150 C in the presence of a catalytically effective amount of a conventional free radical catalyst known to be suitable for the polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers. Preferably, the monomers are fed into the polyol over about three hours while maintaining the polyol at 130 140 C, and the reactants are then maintained at 140 1500C for an additional hour. These are preferred but optional reaction conditions. A polyol chosen for use in producing a polymer polyol must meet several requirements in addition to the requirements discussed above in relation to polyols in general 1 It must act as a solvent or dispersing medium for the film forming polymer produced by polymerization of the ethylenically unsaturated monomers. 2 It must not be so reactive with the film forming polymer M to reduce substantially the reactive radical content of either the solvent or the polymer or to form a gel or a hard infusible resin which would interfere with or even prevent the reaction with the polyisocyanatc. 3 It shbuld form stable solutions or dispersions with the film forming polymer which are preferably dilutable without the formation of undesirable precipitates with the components used to form the polyurethane polymer. 4 It must be a liquid, at least at the temperature used for the reaction with the polyisocyanate. 5 It must have at least two radicals which are reactive with the N C O of the polyisocyanates so as to form a reaction product with the polyisocyanate. Among the polyols that can be employed for producing polymer polyols are hydroxyl terminsted polyesters, polyhydroxyalkanes, polyphenols, polyoxyalkylene polyolsr and the corresponding mercapto derivatives. The monomers which may be used are the polymerizable monomers characterized in that they have at least one polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated group of the type, C C . The monomers can be used singly or in combination to produce homopolymer polyol or copolymer polyol reactive compositions.

Any ot the known chain transfer agents can be present If desired. Iliustrative of catalysts which can be used In producing polymerpolyols are the well known free radical types of vinyl polymerization catalysts, for example, the peroxides, persulfates, perborates, percarbonates, azo compounds, including hydrogen peroxide, dibenzoyl peroxide, acetyl peroxide, benzoyl hydroperoxide, t butyl hydroperoxide, t butyl peroxybenzoate, alphs,alpha azo 2 m ethyl butyronitrile, ipha,alpha 2 methyl heptonitril e, l,l azo l eyelohexane carbonltrile, dim ethyl alpha,alpha azo.isobutyrate, 4,4t azo 4 cyanopentanoic acid, azo bisisobutyronitrile, persuccinic acid, diisopropyl peroxy dicarbonat a mixture of catalysts may also be used. The concentration of the catalyst can vary from 0.001 to 5 percent, preferably from 0.2 to 0.5 percent however, any effective catalytic amount Is satisfactory. The polymerization can also be carried out with an inert organic solvent present. Illustrative thereof are toluene, benzene, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, hexane, heptane, dicyclohexane, dioxane, acetone, N,Ndimethylformamide, and N,N dimethylacetamide. Acceptable polymer polyols normally have a maximum polymer particle size ranging from 1 to . 6 microns preferably, from 1 to 3 microns and most preferably, about 1 micron or less. Polymer polyols having particles of maximum diameter of less than 1 micron are considered for the purposes of this invention to be on the borderline of invisibility when examined under a microscope. Polymer polyols having particles of 1 3 microns maximum diameter are considered to be of medium size. Polymer polyols having particles of 4 6 microns maximum diameter are considered to be of large size. Polymer polyols should contain from 5 to 50 by weight of dispersed polymer. A preferable concentration is 20 to 50 by weight. Polymer polyols having in excess of about 50 by weight of dispersed polymer are ordinarily too viscous for practical purposes. The adducts and polymer polyols prepared with them can be used to produce polyurethane products, particularly polyurethane foams. Where polymer polyol Is used, upon addition of a polyisocyanate to the polymer polyol, the ethylenically unsaturated monomers and the adduct in the polymer polyol both react with the isocyanato groups and are chemically and integrally bound in the resulting polyurethane. Where an adduct Is directly used, preferably dissolved in a polyol, the hydroxyl groups of the polyol and adduct react with the isocyanato groups of the polyisocyanate and are chemically and integrally bound into the polyurethane. The adducts and polymer polyols may be used In prepolymer processes, quasi prepolymer processes and one shot processes as known to those skilled In the art. The polyurethanes may be further reacted with epoxy resins, cured with sulfur, peroxides or other curing agents, or otherwise reacted or modified as known to those skilled in the art.In using the one shot process for production of polyurethanes, it is desirable to also use a silicone oil emulsifier as described in U.S.2,834,748 and 2,917,480 The Isocyanates used to form the polyurethanes of the present invention must be polyfunctionaL Examples of such polyisocyanates are the toluene diisocyanates, hexamethylene diisocyanates, diphenylmethane diisocyanates, naphthalene diisocyanates, triphenylmethane triisocyanates, phenylene diisocyanates, dimethyldiphenylm ethane diisocyanates, triisocyanatodiphenyl ethers . such as meta toluene diisocyanate, 4,S diphenyl diisocyanate, 4,4 diphenylene methane diisocyanate, 1,5naphthalene diisocyanate, 4,4 diphenyl ether diisocyanate, pphenylene diisocyanate, ethylene diisocyanate, trim ethylene diisocyanate, cyclohexylene diisocyanate, 2 chloropropane diisocyanate, xylylene diisocyanates, A mixture of 80 2,4 tolylene diisocyanate and 20 2,6 tolylene diisocyanate is particularly preferred this mixture will be referred to hereinafter as toluene diisocyanate. Other polyisocyanates which can be used will occur to those skilled In the art. The extremely versatile nature of the Invention makes possible the production of products having a wide variety of characteristics, and can effectively be used for forming not only cellular and microcellular polyurethane products, but also films, coatings, cast or molded articles, As is well known, cellular polyurethane products may be obtained by Inducing the polyurethane reaction in the presence of a gas producing agent or blowing agent such as a fluorohydrocarbon. Alternatively, the polyurethane producing reaction may be Induced in the presence of water, which reacts with isocyanate to release carbon dioxide, an effective blowing agent.An excess of the polyisocyanate should be used to compensate for the loss of polyisocyanate due to reaction with water. Since water acts indirectly to release carbon dioxide, water will be considered as a blowing agent in this invention. By this invention,In which polyurethanes and polyurethane foams are produced using the adducts and polymer polyols discussed above, significant improvements may be obtained in the load bearing characteristics ILD of foam products as well as the tensile strength TES and stability of the foam cells. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, styrene and acrylonitrile are copolymerized in an adduct or adduct modified polymerpolyol of the invention and subsequenUy reacted with a polyisocyanate to produce a polyurethane. The polyurethane can be expanded conventionally to produce a foam. As discussed earlier, there have been difficulties in the past with using the styrene aerylonitrile systems for producing polyurethanes. In particular, high styrene acrylonitrile ratios lead to instability of the reaction mixtures used to produce polymer polyols. Production of products using low styrene acrylonitrile ratios or acrylonitrile alone results in excessive buildup of heat from the exothermic curing reaction and causes discoloration of the product. This invention alleviates these problems, as it is possible to produce polyurethane reaction mixtures at a given solids concentration and polyol molecular weight, having high styrene aerylonitrile ratios, without the attendant problems of disptrsion Instability and product discoloration.The styrene acrylonitrile ratios according to the invention are prefer atly in the range from 50 50 up to 100 0 an approximately 80 20 ratio is particulbrly preferred. The polymer dispersions obtained according to this aspect of the invention are characterized by a minute particle size, i.e., little or no tendency to exhibit coagulation or excessive grit content. Rather than using the adducts and polymer polyols of the Invention to produce polyurethanes, other types of polymers may be produced. Por example, the adducts and polymer polyols may be reacted with a polycarboxylic acid or anhydride such reactants are mentioned above , to produce a polyester. While polyurethanes and polyesters have been mentioned specifically, it is to be understood that the utility of the adducts and polymer polyols extends beyond production of these specific polymer classes, and other types of polymers may alternatively be produced. This invention is further illustrated by the following examples, without, however, being restricted thereto. All parts are by weight, mless otherwise specified. Pour standardized polyols were utilized in the Examples Polyol 1 Polypropylene oxide polyethylene oxide triol made from propylene and ethylene oxides and glycerine and having a theoretical number average molecular weight of about 4700 and a hydroxyl number of about 35.9. The alkylene oxide units are present primarily in blocks and the end units are substantially all ethylene oxide units, i.e., the ethylene oxide is used to cap the triol Based on its total weight, this triol contains about 14 wt ethylene oxide. Such a polyol is commercially available from Union Carbide under the trade name Niax ll 27 . Polyol fl Polypropylene oxide polyethylene oxide triol made from propylene and ethylene oxides and glycerine and having a theoretical number average molecular weight of about 6,000 and a hydroxyl number of about 26.1. The alkylene oxide units are present primarily in blocks and the end units are substantially all ethylene oxide units, i.e., the ethylene oxide is used to cap the trioL Based on its total weight, this triol contains about 14 wt ethylene oxide. Such a polyol is commercially available from Union Carbide under the trade name Niax 11 34 . Polyol III Polypropylene oxide polyethylene oxide polyol made from propylene oxide and ethylene oxide end an 80 20 blend by weight of sorbitol and glycerine, having a theoretical number Average molecular weight of about 10,800 and a hydroxyl numbed of about 28.

Polvol IV Polypropylene oxide triol made from propylene oxide And glycerine and having a theoretical number average molecular weight of about 3,000 and a hydroxyl number of about 55.4. Such a polyol is commercially available from Union Carbide under the trade name Niax Lg 56 . The ILD and TES characteristics of foams in the Examples were measured using ASTM D1564 69 standard test methods. The ILD test basically involves measuring the pressure necessary to compress a foam sample of standard size to a specified percentage of one of its original dimensions.The TES test basically Involves compressing a foam sample of standard size to a solid film before the foam sets, and measuring the tensile strength of the film In carrying out the KOH titration test, the amount of unreacted carboxyl groups in a product is determined by direct titration with an alcoholic solution of one tenth normal KOH using Methylene Blue as an indicator pH . Unreacted carboxyl groups are calculated in units of milligrams of KOH per gram of the sample.A KOH equivalent ranging from 0 to about 3 indicates that most carboxyl groups of any carboxylic compounds used in the reactions have been reacted, e.g., with hydroxy moieties. A KOH equivalent of about 4 or greater more particularly 7 or greater , indicates that a significant amount of, free carboxyl groups remain unreacted, as is the case in half esters. The free epoxy content of a reaction mixture may be determined using the pyrldinium hydrochloride method. A sample Is reacted with an .xcess .of pyridinium hydrochloride and the unreacted HCI is titrated with methanolic NaOH to a pink endpoint. The epoxide content Is determined by calculation of the amount of pyridinium hydrochoride consumed during the reaction.In order to correct for inaccuracies due to the presence of any acid in the sample itself an identical sample b then reacted with pyridine instead of pyridinium hydrochloride and the acid value Is added to the calculation for epoxy content.

Unsaturation in an adduct or polymer polyol may be determined using the dodecyl mercaptan method. NMR could alternatively be used .Standard reagents including the following are prepared 1 25 grams ot N dodecyl mercaptan in one liter of ethanol 2 50 grams of potassium anhydride In 1 liter of ethanol and 3 a C.os to 0.01 Normal iodine solution in aqueous potassium iodide. An adduct or polymer polyol sample weighing about 6.5 grams is added to a 250 ml iodine nask containing 50 ml of ethanol. After dissolution of the sample, 25 ml of alcoholic mercaptan solution is pipetted into the nask and neutralized with potassium hydroxide the potassium anhydride solution . One additional milliliter of potassium anhydride Is then added as a catalyst. After allowing the mixture to stand for about two minutes, the mixture is acidified with 1 2 ml of facial acetic acid and diluted with an additional 25 ml of ethanol.The solution Is titrated with the standardized iodine solution to a faint yellow endpoint. A blank is run using the same procedure, without adding adduct or polymer polyol sample and with no potassium hydroxide.The mlllimoles of unsaturation per gram of the sample are calculated as follows millimoles unsaturation B A N gram. of sample W B r milliliters of iodine required to titrate blank A t mllliliters of iodine required to titrate the sample N Normality of the iodine solution. a weight of the sample GSee Kohthoff and Belcher, Volumetric Analysis,.

A foam was made from the half ester adduct, by combining 100 grams of the adduct with one gram of Union Carbide silicone no. 6202, along with 53.7 grams of toluene diisocyanate, 4.5 grams water, 0.125 grams Union Carbide Niax catalyst A 5, andqi grams of stannous octoate, and expanding the mixture into a foam by conventional techniques.Example 5 A polymer polyol was produced using the adduct from Example 4, and the polymer polyol was used to produce a polyurethane foam.Specifically, an 85 15 blend of Niax 16 56 Niax 11 27 polyols, and an 80 20 blend of styrenelacrylonitrile monomers were prepared. An aliquot of 2.5 grams of the adduct produced in Example 4 was combined with 67.5 grams of the polyol blend. Over a period of three hours, a mixture ot 30 grams of the monomer blend and 0.6 grams azo bis butyronitrile catalyst was fed into the mixture of adduct and polyol blend. The resulting mixture was kept at about 130 140 C and stirred continuously. After feeding of the monomer blend with the catalyst was completed, the mixture was then stirred at a temperature of about 140 150 C for an additional hour. The resulting polymepolyol product had an acceptable viscosity and particle size. A foam was produced from the polymer polyol according to the techniques used in Example 4.Example 6 An adduct was produced by reaction of a polyol with the product of reaction of a tricarboxylic acid wIth a low molecular weight polyhydroxyhydrocarbon , and the edduct was used to produce a polyurethane foam. To produce the adduct, ethylene glycol was reacted with 4 earboxyheptanedioic acid. Specifically, 62.02 grams 0 mole of ethylene glycol was esterified with 204 grams Q mole of 4 carboxyheptanedioic acid under agitation at about 95 C for about 24 hours. A liquid bydroxyearboxyllc acid product was formed. An aliquot of 10.5 grams of the hydroxycarboxylic acid was added to 500 grams of Union CarbideNiax ll 27 polyol and the polyol was esterified at about 180 C for about.10 hours. The carboxyl groups of the hydroxycarboxylic acid reacted with the polyol, reducing the KOH value to below 1. An aliquot of the adduct was then used to produce a polyurethane foam by the technique In Example 4.Example 7 A polymer polyol was produced using the adduct from Example 6, and the polymer polyol was used to produce a polyurethane foam. More specifically, an 85 15 blend of Niax 16 56 Niax 11 27 polyols, and an 80 20 blend of styrene acrylonitrile monomers were prepared. An aliquot of 2.5 grams of the adduct produced in Example 6 was combined with 67.5 grams of the polyol blend. Over a period of 3 hours, a mixture of 30 grams of the monomer blend and 0.6 grams azo bis butyronitrile catalyst was ted Into the mixture of adduct and polyol blend. The resulting mixture was kept at 130 140 C and stirred continuously. After feeding of the monomer blend with catalyst was completed, the mixture was then stirred at a temperature of 140 150 C for an additional hour.The resulting polymer polyol product had an acceptable viscosity and particle size A foam was produced from the polymer polyol according to the techniques used in Example 4. SUPERIORITY OP ADDUCTS HAVING SUBSTANTIAL FREE CARBOXYLCONTENTExample 8 Trials were conducted to demonstrate the superiority of adducts having a substantial free carboxyl content i.e., half esters , as compared with adducts having negligible free carboxyl content. The results of these trials are shown in Table 4. Procedures similar to those used in Example 1 were followed to produce the adducts and polyurethane foams. The results in terms of both ILD and TES of product foams point to the superiority of a KON value acid equivalent in half esters from dicarboxylic anhydrides of about 10 see trial 22 .

To produce the adduct, ethylene glycol was first reacted with maleic anhydride. Specifically, 62.02 grams 1 mole of ethylene glycol was esterifed with 98 grams Q mole of maleic anhydride under agitation, at 95 C for 24 hours. Reaction conditions prevented the second carboxyl carbon of the maleic anhydride molecules from reacting, and a liquid hydroxycarboxylic acid product was formed. The KOH equivalent free earboxyl groups of the product was approximately 240 milligrams KOH per gram. An aliquot of 18.7 grams of the hydroxycarboxylic acid produced above was added to 500 grams of Union Carbide Niax ll 27 polyol and the polyol was esterified at 180 C until the KOH value was reduced to 0.5. .The carboxyl groups of the hydroxycarboxylic acid reacted with the polyol and the viscosity of the adduct increased to the 10,000 Thus the carboxyl groups in the hydroxyearboxylic acid were reacted with the polyol without reducing the hydroxy functionality of the polyoL Example U A series of trials were conducted using procedures similar to that used in Example 10. The results of these trials are shown in Table. 6. The proportions ot p.olyol and specially produced hydroxycarboxylic acid are expressed In relative proportions by weight In grams. Trial 28 is a control employing a polyol without modification. In trial 29 a hydroxycarboxylic acid was formed by the reaction of ethylene glycol and succinic anhydride, which was then reacted with the polyol.In trial 30, a hydroxycarboxylic acid was formed as the reaction product of ethylene glycol and maleic anhydride, and the hydroxycarboxylic acid was then reacted with the polyoL In trial 31, a hydroxycarboxylic acid was produced as the reaction product of ethylene glycol and itaconie acid, and the hydroxycarboxylic acid was reacted with the polyol. The adducts were then reacted with polyisocyanates, and conventional expanding techniques were employed to produce polyurethane foams. The properties of the product foams were then tested. The maleic anhydride ethylene glycol hydroxycarboxylic acid adduct of trial 30 produced a better foam than the itaconic acid ethylene glycol hydroxycarboxylic acid adduct of trial 31, and the itaeonic acid adduct of trial 31 produced a better foam than the succinic anhydride ethylene glycol hydroxycarboxylic cld adduct of trial 29. All three of the trials 29 31 produced better results than the modified polyol of trial 28.

The results of these trials are shown, in Table 7.Trials 32 and 33 were controls, in which no modification of the polyol was carried out. Trial 32 is the control for trials 34 36 and 38 employing polyol I trial 33Is the control for trials 37 and 39 employing a polyol I III G5 85 weight ratio blend. Trials 34 and 35 employed mono epoxides trials 36 to 39 employed diepoxides. A representative preparation using a diepoldde proceeded as follows. A reaction vessel continuously flushed with nitrogen and equipped with a thermometer, renux condenser, stirrer and heat exchange means was charged with 250 grams of Niax polyol 11 27 polyol 1 , 5.7 grams of Union Carbide diepoxide ERL 4221 3,4epoxycyclohexylm ethyl 3,4 epoxycycl ohexane carboxyl ate and .125 milliliters of boron trifluoride catalyst.The mixture was heated to about 70 C C and allowed to react for about 10 hours until the epoldde content of the mixture was found to be about one half of the initial amount, indicsting that one of the epoxide radicals on the diepoxide molecules had reacted with a hydroxyl group from the polyol. The epoxy content of the initial reaction solution was 0.16 milligrams per gram, and the final oxide content was about 0.062 milligrams per gram of product.The viscosity of the final product was 7,800EMI42.1 fThe trials involving use of monoepoxides were run in substantially the nme manner, except that at the end of the reactions, e.g., about 10 hours, the free epoxide content in the reaction mixture had been reduced substantially to zero. In summary, the epoxy reactants in trials 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 respectively, were ally glycidyl ether phenyl glycidyl ether Union Carbide ERL 4221 3,4 epoxy cyclohexylmethyl 3,4 epoxy cyclohexylhexane carboxylate ERL 4221 ERL 4234 2 3,4 epoxy cyclohexyl 5,5 spiro 3,4 epoxy cycloexane m eta dioxane and ERL 4 234. The free epoxy content of the reaction mixtures was tested using the pyridinium hydrochloride test method. Trials 34 39 generally showed improvements in ILD and TES as compared to the controls. Comparison of the results in trials 34 and 35 showed that allyl glycidyl ether which in unsaturated, gave a better foam product than phenyl glycidyl ether, which .15 aromatic but contains no ethylenic unsaturation. ApparentlyIn the case of ethylenically unsaturated epoxides the unsaturated groups constitute reactive sites In addition to the epoxy group. Allyl glycidyl ether thus reacts In a somewhat analogous manner to diepoxides.In trials 37 and 39, styrene and acrylonitrile in an 80 20 weight ratio were added In an amount of 30 to the reaction mixturcs, based on total weight of the reaction mixtures, so that polymer polyols were produced.The adducts and polymer polyols were combined with polyisocyanates and expanded Into polyurethane foam according to conventional techniques.

Phenyl Glycidyl Ether Example 13 An adduct was produced by reaction of a polyol with the product of reaction of a polyepoxide with a polybasic carboxylic acid , and the adduct was used to produce a polyurethane foam. To produce the adduct, maleic acid was first reacted with limonene dioxide. Specifically, a 500 ml flat bottom flask continuously nushed with nitrogen gas and cquipped with a reflux condenser, thermometer and a stirrer was charged first with 58 grams of maleic acid and then with 84 grams of limonene dioxide. The initial KOH value of the maleic acid, and epoxy equivalent of the limonene dioxide were, respectively, 395.0 mg g and 1.76g g mole. The limonene dioxide was continuously fed into the flask over a period of about seventeen minutes.An exothermal reaction took place, lasting until about fifteen minutes after all of the limone dioxide was added to the flask. Due to the reaction condItions, and particularly because the highest reaction temperature was only about 130 C, the product was a half ester, in which maleic acid and limone dioxide reacted leaving an acid group and an epoxy group unreacted. The KOH and epoxy equivalent values of the half esters were 240.3 mg g and .67 g g mole, respectively. Next, a resin reaction vessel continuously nushed with nitrogen and equipped with thermometer, stirrer, reflux condenser and heat exchange means was charged with 500 grams polyol I Niax 11 27 , 18.8 grams of the half ester and 0.25 ml of tetra isopropyl titanate catalyst.The polyol was esterified by heating the vessel contents to about 180 C for about 10 hours. The viscosity of the product was about 3,500EMI45.1 The KOH and epoxy equivalents of the product were reduced, respectively, to about 2.1 mg g and 0.007 mgtrmole. A foam was made from the adduct by combining 100 grams of the adduct with LO grams Union Carbide silicone no. 6202, along with 52.4 grams of toluene diisocyanate, 4.5 grams water,0.125 grams UnionCarbide Niax catalyst Aw6, and grams stannous octoate, and expanding the mixture into a foam by conventional techniques. The product foam had a density of 1.9g cm , and ILD values at 25 and 65 compression of 25.7 and 45.3, respectively. Example 14 A polymer polyol was produced using the adduct from Example 13, and the polymer polyol was used to produce a polyurethane foam.An 85 15 blend of Niax 16 56 Niax 11 27 polyols was prepared by mixing together 230.4 grams Niax 16 56 and 40.6 grams Niax ll 27. A 70 30 blend of styrenelacrylonitrile was prepared by mixing together 88.4 grams styrene and 37.9 grams aerylonitrile. An aliquot of 21.1 grams of the adduct produced in Example 13 was combined with the polyol blend.The styrene serylonitril e and 2.6 grams of azobisbutyronitrile catalyst were mixed together and then fed into the mixture of adduct and polyol blend at a rate of about L41 ml minute. The resulting mixture was kept at about 130 C and stirred continuously. After feeding of the monomer blend with catalyst was completed, the mixture was then stirred for an additional hour at the same temperature. The resulting polymerpolyol product had a maximum particle size bordering on Invisibility order microscopic examination less than about 1 micron diameter , and a viscosity of about 2,000 cps. A foam was made from the polymer polyol by combining 100 grams of the polymer polyol with 1.0 grams Union Carbide silicone no.6202, along with 53.7 grams toluene diisocyanate, 4.5 grams water, .125 grams Union Carbide Niax catalyst A 6, and .2 grams stannous octoate, and expanding the mixture into a foam by conventional techniques. The product foam had a density of 2.0 g em3, and ILD values at 25 and 65 compression of 39.3 and 92.7, respectively. POLYMER POLYOL PREPARATION AND USE IN PRODUCINGPOLYURETHANE FOAMSExample 15 Trials were conducted to demonstrate the value of polymer polyols incorporating adducts of the invention. The results of these trials are shown In Tables 8a and 8b, which respectively summarize trials 40 44 and 45 49. In an exemplary preparation, 1,500 grams of Niax polyol 1127 polyol I , together with 49 grams maleic anhydride and 0.75 mIlliliter ot tetra lsopropyl titanate catalyst were combined and heated to 120 C for 45 mInutes to dissolve the maleic anhydride. The reaction mixture was then heated to 170 C for about 3 hours, yielding a half ester reaction product.In order to produce a polymer polyol, an 85 15 blend of Niax 16 56 Niax 11 27 polyols, and an 80 20 blend of styrene acrynolitrile monomers were prepared. An aliquot of 2.5 grams of the adduct produced above was combined with 67.5 grams of the polyol blend. Over a period of three hours, a mixture of 30 grams of the monomer blend and 0.6 grams azo bls butyroni trile catalyst was fedInto the mixture of adduct and polyol blend. The resulting mixture was kept at . 130 140 C and stirred continuously. After feeding of the monomer blend with the catalyst was completed, the mixture was then stirred at a temperature of v 140 150 C for an additional hour.The resulting polymer polyol product had a viscosity of about 9,000 cps and small particle size with some large particles. A foam was produced from the polymer polyol using conventional techniques. Additional trials were run in a similar manner, and the results are shown In Table 8. The above discussion relates to trial 44 . Trial 40 was a control employing no adducts. Trials 41 43, 44 46, and 47 49 employed 10 , 5 and 2.59s of adducts, respectively, based on the weight of the polyol used to dilute the adduct. Trials 41, 44, and 47 employed Polyol 11 27 maleic anhydride adducts. Trials 42, 45 and 48 employed polyol 11 27 maleic anhydrideethylene glycol adducts. Trials 43, 46, and 49 employed polyol 11 27 maleic anhydride 1.3 butylene glycol adducts. The latter group trials 43, 46 and 9 yielded the highest ILD percent Increase values. The polyol 11 27 maleic anhydride ethylene glycol adduct trials trials 2, 45, and 48 yielded the best Improvements in TES. TABLE 8A EMI48.1 tb E SEP 40 SEP 41 SEP 41 SEP 43 SEP 40 tb SEP f SEP SEP o.

The results of these trials are shown in Table 9.Stable polystyrene dispersions are very difficult to make in polymer polyols, but acceptable products may be produced using the adducts of the Invention as demonstrated by these trials. In trials 50 53 the base polyol used consisted of a blend of 85 Niax 16 56 with 15 Niac 11 27 by weight. In trial 54, no Niax 16 56 was used and the base polyol was 100 Niax 11 27. Trial 50 was a control in which no adduct was used.In trial S1, a half ester adduct produced by reactingNiax 11 34 with maleic acid was used In trial 52, a half ester adduct produced by reacting Niax 11 34 with maleic anhydride was used in trial 53, a half ester adduct was produced by reacting Niax 1l 27 with maleic acId and in trial 54, a half ester adduct was produced by reacting Niax O27 with maleic acid The percentages of the above adducts used in the trials ranged from 25 up to 10 . In the control trial, no ethylenically unsaturated monomers were used in the other trials, the ethylenically unsaturated monomer was 100 styrene. The maximum particle size in the polymer polyol dispersions produced in trials 51 54 was in an acceptable size range of 1 5 microns. In trials 50 and 52 the Initial products in trial 50 the product is a simple polyol, and in trial 52 the product is a polymer polyol , were used to produce polyurethane foams by reaction with polyisocyanates. The ILD percent increases in trial 52 at both 25 and 65 compression demonstrated that the foam in trial 52 was superior to that in control trial 50.These trials showed that polymer polyols incorporating 100 polystyrene with no acrylonitrile may be produced according to the present invention with adducts, and additionally show that polyurethanes superior to those produced using simple polyols may be produced with these polymer polyols.

These trials showed that polymer polyols prepared with the adducts uniformly gave smaller particle size than the polymer polyols prepared with direct addition of maleic anhydride.

Where blends of polyols were used, the Niax polyols are shown as a fraction, e.g., 16 56 11 27. The weight ratio In these polyol blends is 85 15. Table 16 trials 89 96 , summarizes control trials In which monomeric ERL 4221 diepoxide and monomeric maleic anhydride were combined with polyols in an attempt to produce polymer polyols. The particle size data show that the results in these trials were poor. Table 17 trials 97 103 , summarizes trials in which adducts were first prepared and then added to the monomers and additional polyol to produce polymer polyols. The percentage of adduct used in the polymer polyols was 10 . No adduct waS used in trial 97. In trials 98 99, an adduct formed by reaction between 1l 27 polyol and one of the epoxy groups of ERL 4221 was used. In trials 100 101, an adduct formed by reaction between ll 27 polyol and an intermediate, the intermediate being formed by 1 1 molar equivalent reaction between maleic anhydride and 1,3 butylene glycol was used.In trials 102 and 103, respectively, 2,3 butytene glycol and ethylene glycol were substituted for the 1,3 butylene glycol used in trials 100 101. Trials 97 98 gave acceptable results trial 99 where 100 styrene as the ethylenically unsaturated monomer was used resulted in coagulation. The polymer polyols in trials 100 103 all were characterized by particle size bordering on Invisibility under the microscope. In Table 18 trIals 104 111 , the percentage of adduct used to make the polymer polyols was reduced to 5 . Trials 104 and 105 were controlt in which no adduct was used. In trials 106 111, an adduct formed by reaction between U 27 polyol and an intermediate, the lntejmediate being formed by 1 1 molar equivalent reaction between maleic anhydride and 1,3 butylene glycol, was used. The particle size of the polymer polyols in trials 106 111 where 5 of adduct was used , was very good. In trials 107 108, Niax LG 56 polyol polyol IV , a very low molecular weight polyol, was used. Nevertheless, polymer polyols of very small particle size were produced. In Table ig trials 112 117 the adduct content in the polymerpolyols was Increased to 20 . Trials 112 113 were controls In which no adduct was used. In trials 114 117, the adduct used was produced by reaction of a polyol with an intermediate, the Intermediate formed by 1 1 molar reaction between maleic anhydride and 1,3 butylene glycol. The only trial where complete coagulation was not encountered was trial 2, control trial using a blended polyol and no adduct. The trials summarized in Table 17 show that good results are obtained when approximately 10 adduct concentration Is employed In making a polymer polyoL The results In Table 18 show that a 5 adduct.content also gave good results. The trials reported In Table 19 where 20 adduct was used , gave less acceptable results and showed thatSuch a high adduct content In polymer polyols probably is not advisable.The control trials shown In Table 16 showed that adducts yield improved polymer polyols of better particle size.
