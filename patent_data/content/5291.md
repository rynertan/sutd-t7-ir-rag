## Description
PROCESS FOR THE RECOVERY OF CYCIOHEXANONE OXIME The invention relates to a process for the recovery of cyclohexanone oxime from a solution of the oxime in toluene obtained in the preparation of cyclohexanone oxime from cyclohexanone. According to British Patent Specification 1,303,739, such a solution can be obtained by making a solution of cyclohexanone in toluene react with a hydroxylamine salt dissolved in an aqueous buffered reaction medium. In this known process the conversion is not always complete, so that an aiter reaction at elevated pH, e.g. a pH of 4.5, may be necessary to obtain a solution of oxime in toluene that contains hardly any more cyclohexanone, The final result is a solution of cyclohexanone oxime in toluene from which the oxime can be recovered by distillation. A method for the recovery of cyclohexanone oxime from a solution of this compound in toluene by distillation has been described in British Patent Specification 1,138,750. In this known method part of the toluene is first removed in a distillation column and, next, the remainder of the toluene is removed from the residual bottom product in a second distillation column, so that the bottom product remaining in the second distillation column no longer contains toluene and consists of virtually pure cyclohexanone oxime. The toluene thus obtained still contains some oxime and is re used as a solvent in the formation of oxime. It has now been found that cyclohexanone oxime of sufficient purity can be economically recovered by distillation from a solution of the oxime in toluene that contains over 0.5 gram of cyclohexanone per 100 grams of oxime, as obtained in the incomplete conversion of cyclohexanone, so that an after reaction at such an elevated pH that complete conversion is achieved can be omitted in the formation of oxime. The process according to the invention for the recovery of cyclohexanone oxime from a solution of the oxime in toluene obtained in the preparation of cyclohexanone oxime from cyclohexanone by separating the toluene and the oxime by distillation and recovering substantially pure oxime is characterized in that the distillatory separation is started from a solution of the oxime in toluene obtained by incomplete conversion of the cyclohexanone and having a cyclohexanone content of over 0.5 gram per 100 grams of oxime, and cyclohexanone oxime with less than 0.1 gram of cyclohexanone per 100 grams of oxime is recovered. The starting solution in the process according to the invention may contain such an amount of cyclohexanone that no after reaction at elevated pH is required in the formation of oxime. This constitutes a considerable saving, as an increase of the pH results in the production of salt, e.g. ammonium salt if the pH is raised by means of ammonia, and this salt has to be removed. Incomplete conversion of cyclohexanone into cyclohexanone oxime may give rise to the formation of a reaction product containing oxime with a varying cyclohexanone content. The process according to the invention can be effected economically with starting solutions containing considerably more than 0.5 gram of cyclohexanone per 100 grams of oxime. If the formation of oxime is effected, for instance, at a pH of about 1.8, the resulting solution of oxime in toluene contains about 2 grams of cyclohexanone per 100 grams of oxime.However, a cyclohexanone content of the starting solution of over 35 grams per 100 grams of oxime is less recommendable and is no longer of practical significance. The process according to the invention can be effected in practice in various ways. The distillatory separation may, for instance, be effected by means of 3 distillation columns, in the first of which toluene is distilled off, while the bottom product of the first column is fed to the top of the second column, where the desired oxime is separated as the bottom product, the top product of the second column is fed to the third column, where a top product containing toluene and cyclohexanone is separated off and a bottom product containing oxime remains which is recycled to the second column.A very suitable embodiment is the one using two distillation columns, in which toluene is distilled off in the first column, the bottom product of the first column is fed to the second column below the top, and the desired oxime is separated as the bottom product in the second column, the top product being a mixture of cyclohexanone and toluene. As in the process according to British Patent Specification 1,138,750, the pressures in the columns in which the distillatory separation according to the invention is effected are so chosen that the cyclohexanone oxime to be recovered is not subjected to too high temperatures. The process according to the invention is further elucidated in the following examples.Example I In a distillation device comprising two columns each equipped with a heater for the bottom liquid and a condenser , a solution of 9127 kg of cyclohexanone oxime, 187 kg oi cyclohexanone and 28120 kg of toluene is fed per hour to the bottom of the first column diameter 2.5 m, 12 theoretical trays .
