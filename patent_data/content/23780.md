## Description
NUCLEATED SILVER HALIDE EMULSIONS, PHOTOGRAPHIC ELEMENTS AND PROCESSES This invention relates to nucleated silver halide emulsions, photographic elements and processes for preparing direct positive images. More specifically, this invention relates to emulsions with silver halide grains capable of forming an internal latent image, the silver halide grains having a nucleating agent adsorbed to the surface thereof. Photographic elements which produce images having an optical density directly related to the radiation received on exposure are said to be negative working.A positive photographic image can be formed by producing a negative photographic image and then forming a second or positive photographic image. A directpositive image is understood in photography to be a positive image that is formed without first forming a visible negative image. Positive dye images which are not direct positive images are commonly produced in colour photography by reversal processing in which a negative silver image is formed and a complementary positive dye image is then formed in the same photographic element. The term direct reversal has been applied to direct positive photographic elements and processing which produces a positive dye image without forming a negative silver image. A conventional approach to forming direct positive images is to use photographic elements employing internal latent image forming silver halide grains. After imagewise exposure, the silver halide grains are developed with a surface developer. Such a development leaves the latent image sites within the silver halide grains substantially unrevealed. Simultaneously, either by uniform light exposure or by the use of a nucleating agent, the silver halide grains are subjected to development conditions that would cause fogging of a negative working photographic element. The internal latent image forming silver halide grains which received actinic radiation during imagewise exposure develop under these conditions at a comparatively slow rate, as compared to the internal latent imageforming silver halide grains not imagewise exposed.The result is a direct positive silver image. In colourphotography, the oxidized developer that is produced during silver development may be used to produce a corresponding positive, direct reversal dye image.Multicolour direct reversal photographic images have been extensively investigated in connection with image transfer photography. It is advantageous to employ nucleating agents in preference to uniform light exposure in the directpositive process described above. The term nucleat ing agent is employed herein in its art recognized usage to mean a fogging agent capable of permitting the selective development of internal latent imageforming silver halide grains which have not been imagewise exposed in preference to the development of silver halide grains having an internal latent image formed by imagewise exposure. A useful class of nucleating agents is aryihydra zides. These nucleating agents can be incorporated in a developer solution or directly within a photographic element. Significant advantages have been achieved by adsorbing certain arylhydrazide nucleating agents to the surface of internal latent image forming silver halide grains. This permits small amounts of the nucleating agents to be employed, as compared with those which are nonadsorbed. However, this narrows the choice of arylhydrazide nucleating agents to those including an adsorption promoting group. A known class of adsorbed arylhydrazide nucleating agents is the acylhydrazinophenylthioureas described in U.S. Patent 4,030,925. These acyl hydrazinophenylthioureas are characterized by the 3 position nitrogen atom of the thiourea moiety being mono substituted. However, there is now a demand for nucleating agents having properties which are improved as compared with those disclosed in the prior art particularly as regards the image discrimination obtained in the processed element containing the nucleating agent. The foregoing improvement may now be achieved by the present invention which provides a silver halide emulsion comprised of silver halide grains capable of forming an internal latent image, the silver halide grains having adsorbed on their surface a nucleating agent, characterized in that the nucleating agent has the formulaEMI3.1 wherein R is hydrogen or an alkyl, cycloalkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxyalkyl or phenylalkyl group R1 is a phenylene group or a phenylene group substituted with alkyl, halogen or alkcxy and R2 and R3 are independently a an alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxyalkyl or phenylalkyl group having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms b a cycloalkyl group c a phenyl group having a Hammett sigma value derived electron withdrawing characteristic less positive than 0.50 or d naphthyl or R2 and R3 together form a heterocyclic group having a 5 or 6 membered ring which may have at least one additional hetero atom selected from nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur and selenium the alkyl groups, except as otherwise noted, in each instance have 1 to 6 carbon atoms and the cycloalkyl groups have 3 to 10 carbon atoms. Preferred 3,3 disubstituted acylhydrazinophenyl thiourea nucleating agents used in the invention are those of the formula EMI4.1 wherein R is hydrogen or methyl and R2 and R3 are independently an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a phenylalkyl group wherein the alkyl has 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group having a Hammett sigma value derived electron withdrawing characteristic less positive than 0.50 or R2 and R3 together form a saturated heterocyclic nucleus having a 5 or 6 membered ring wherein the hetero atom comprises at least one of nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur and selenium.TheEMI4.2 formula I is an acyl group which is the residue of a carboxylic acid, such as one of the acyclic carboxylic acids, including formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, higher homologues of these acids having up to 7 carbon atoms, and halogen, alkoxy, phenyl and equivalent substituted derivatives thereof. The acyl group is more generally formed by an unsubstituted acyclic aliphatic carboxylic acid having 1 to 5 carbon atoms. Preferred acyl groups are formyl and acetyl.As between compounds which differ solely in terms of having a formyl or an acetyl group, the compound containing the formyl group exhibits higher nucleating agent activity. The alkyl groups in the substituents to the carboxylic acids have 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms. In addition to the acyclic aliphatic carboxylic acids, it is recognized that the carboxylic acid can be chosen so that R is a cyclic aliphatic group having 3 to 10 carbon atoms, such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, methylcyclohexyl, cyclooctyl, cyclodecyl and bridged ring variations, such as bornyl and isobornyl groups. Cyclohexyl is a preferred cycloalkyl group. The use of alkoxy ,cyano and halogensubstituted cycloalkyl groups are suitable. As indicated by R1 in formula I , preferred 3,3disubstituted arylhydrazinophenylthioureas employed in the practice of this invention contain a phenylene or substituted phenylene group. Specifically preferred phenylene groups are m and p phenylene groups.Exemplary of preferred phenylene substituents are alkoxy substituents having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, alkyl substituents having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, fluoro , chloro , bromo and iodo substituents. Unsubstituted phenylene groups are preferred. Preferred alkyl groups are those which have 1 to 4 carbon atoms. In formula I R2 and R3 can independently take a variety of forms. One specifically contemplated form can be an alkyl group or a substituted alkyl group, such as a haloalkyl group, alkoxyalkyl group or phenylalkyl group having a total of up to 18, preferably up to 12, carbon atoms. Specifically R2 and or R3 can take the form of a methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl or higher homologue group having up to 18 total carbon atoms a fluoro , chloro , bromo , iodo methoxy , ethoxy , propoxy , butoxy substituted alkyl groups wherein the total number of carbon atoms are of 2 to 18 and a phenyl substituted alkyl group wherein the total number of carbon atoms is at least 7, as in the case of benzyl, and up to about 18.In a preferred form indicated in formula II R2 and or R3 can take the form of an alkyl or phenylalkyl group wherein the alkyl groups are in each instance from i to 6 carbon atoms. In addition to the acyclic aliphatic and aromatic forms discussed above, R2 and or R3 can take the form of a cyclic aliphatic group, such as a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 10 carbon atoms. Cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, methylcyclohexyl, cyclooctyl, cyclodecyl and bridged ring variations, such as bornyl and isobornyl groups, can be used.Cyclohexyl is a preferred cycloalkyl. The use of alkoxy , cyano and halogen substituted cycloalkyl groups is contemplated. R2 and or R3 can be a phenyl group having aHammett sigma value derived electron withdrawing characteristic less positive than 0.50. R2 and orR3 can be chosen from among phenyl groups having cyano, fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo, alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms and alkoxy groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms as phenyl ring substituents. Phenyl ring substituents are preferred in the para or 4 ring position. Exemplary meta and para sigma values and procedures for their determination are set forth by J.Hine in Physical Organic Chemistry, second edition, page 87, published in 1962, H. VanBekkum, P.E. Verkade and B. M. Wepster in Rec. Trav. Chim., Volume 78,. page 815, published in 1959, P. R. Wells in Chem. Revs.,Volume 63, page 171, published in 1963, by H. H. Jaffe in Chem. Revs., Volume 53, page 191, published in 1953, by M. J. S. Dewar and P. J. Grisdale in J. Amer. Chem. Soc., Volume 84, page 3548, published in 1962, and by Barlin and Perrin in Quart. Revs., Volume 20, page 75 et seq, published in 1966. For the purpose of this invention, ortho substituents to the phenyl ring can be assigned to the published para sigma values. Rather than being independently chosen, R2 andR3 can together form, along with the 3 position nitrogen atom of the thiourea, a heterocyclic nucleus forming a 5 or 6 membered ring. The hetero ring atoms can be chosen from among nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur and selenium. The ring necessarily contains at least one hetero nitrogen atom. Exemplary rings include morpholino, piperidino, pyrrolidinyl, pyrrolinyl, thiomorpholino, thiazolidinyl, thiazolinyl, selenazolidinyl, 4 selenazolinyl, imidazolidinyl, imidazolinyl, oxazolidinyl and 4 oxazolinyl rings. Preferred rings are saturated or otherwise constructed to avcid electron withdrawal from the 3 position nitrogen atom. Preferred values for R are H, for R1 phenyl, for each of R2 and R3, CH3, benzyl and phenyl and for R2 and R3 together morpholino, piperidino and pyrrolidino. To synthesize the 3,3 disubstituted acylhydrazinophenylthioureas used in the inventions nitrophenylhydrazine can be employed as a starting material and can be used to form the desired l acyl 2 aminophenyl hydrazine using procedures that are generally described in U.S. Patent 4,030,925. A general procedure for synthesis using a l acyl ,2 aminophenyl hydrazine as a starting material is to dissolve this material in acetone and cool the resulting solution to 780C in a dry ice acetone bath. The l acyl 2 aminophenyl hydrazine is then reacted with l,11 thiocarbonyldiimidazole. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to 250C and then the acetone solvent is removed. The remaining solid residue consist essentially of a mixture of a 2 acylhydrazinophenylisothiocyanate and imidazole. The solid is washed with water to remove the imidazole, and the remaining material is recrystallized from acetone to give the 2 acylhydrazinophenylisothiocyanate separated from the imidazole.The isothiocyanate is then reacted in a suitable solvent, such as ethanol or acetonitrile, with a secondary gamine, where R2 and R3 are independent substituents, or a heterocyclic compound having a functionally equivalent nitrogen atom, where R2 and together form a heterocyclic ring.After a few minutes reflux the 1 2 acylhydrazino phenyl 3,3 disubstituted thiourea separates from the solution as a precipitate. The solid product can be filtered off, washed with diethyl ether and dried. This synthesis can be summarized as follows EMI8.1 Where a thiocarbamoyl chloride is available which contains substituents corresponding to the desired R2 and R3 substituents, such as dimethyl or diethyl carbamoyl chloride, an alternative synthetic route is to react the carbamoyl chloride with a desired l acyl 2 aminophenyl hydrazine in an inert solvent, such as acetonitrile, in the presence of a base, such as trJethylamine, under a nitrogen atmosphere at 250C. The mixture is chilled and the product separates out of solution. The solid is filtered off and then stirred in warm water e.g. 350C to remove hydrochloride salts. The remaining solid material represents the 3,3 dis ubstituted l acylhydrazinophenyl thiourea. This synthesis can be summarized as follows EMI9.1 Illustrative specific 3,3 disubstituted acylhydrazinophenylthioureas useful in the practice of this invention include those set forth below in Table I.

The surface developer referred to herein as gKodakDeveloper DK 50 is described in the Handbook ofChemistry and Physics, 30th edition, 1947, ChemicalRubber Publishing Company, Cleveland, Ohio, page 2558, and has the following composition Water, 520C 50Q.O cc N methyl p aminophenol sulphate 2.5 g Sodlum sulphite, desiccated 30.0 g Hydroqulnone 2.5 g Sodium metaborate 10.0 g Potassium bromide 0.5 g Water to make 1.0 litre Internal latent image silver halide grains which can be employed in the practice of this invention are well known in the art. Patents teaching the use of internal latent image silver halide grains in photographic emulsions and elements include Davey et alU.S. Patent 2,592,250, Porter et al U.S. Patent 3,206,313, Milton U.S. Patent 3,761,266, Ridgway U.S.Patent 3,586,505 Gilman et al U.S. Patent 3,772,030 Gilman et al U.S. Patent 3,761,267 and Evans U.S.Patent 3,761,276. The internal latent image silver halide grains preferably contain bromide as the predominant halide.The silver bromide grains can consist essentially of silver bromide or they can contain silver bromoiodide, silver chlorobromide, silver chlorobromoiodide or mixtures thereof. Internal latent image forming sites can be incorporated into the grains by either physical or chemical internal sensitization. Davey et al, cited above, for example, teaches the physical formation of internal latent image forming sites by the halide conversion technique. Chemical formation of internal latent image forming sites can be produced through the use of sulphur, gold, selenium, tellurium and or reduction sensitizers of the type described, for example, in Sheppard et al U.S. Patent 1,623,499 Waller et al U.S. Patent 2,399,083 McVeigh U.S. Patent 3,297,447 and Dunn U.S. Patent 3,297,446.Internal latent image sites can also be formed through the incorporation of metal dopants, particularly GroupVIII noble metals, such as ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, iridium, osmium and platinum, as taught by BerrimanU.S. Patent 3,367,778. The preferred foreign metal ions are polyvalent metal ions which include the above noted Group VIII dopants, as well as polyvalent metal ions such as lead, antimony, bismuth, arsenic and the like. In highly preferred embodiments, the silver halide grains are formed in the presence of bismuth, lead or iridium ions. In a preferred approach the internal latent image sites can be formed within the silver halide grains during precipitation of silver halide. In an alternate approach, a core grain can be formed which is treated to form the internal image sites and then a shell deposited over the core grains. The silver halide grains employed in the prac tice of this invention are preferably monodispersed, and in some embodiments are preferably large grain emulsions made according to Wilgus German OLS 2,107,118. The monodispersed emulsions are those which comprise silver halide grains having a substantially uniform diameter. Generally, in such emulsiona, nomore than about 5 percent by number of the silver halide grains smaller than the mean grain size and or no more than about 5 percent by number of the silver halide grains larger than the mean grain size vary in diameter from the mean grain diameter by more than about 40 percent. Preferred photographic emulsions of this invention comprise silver halide grains, at least 95 percent by weight of the grains having a diameter which is within 40 percent and preferably within about 30 percent of the mean grain diameter. Mean grain diameter, i.e., average grain size, can be determined using conventional methods, e.g., such as projective area, as shown in an article by Trivelli and Smith entitled Empirical RelationsBetween Sensitometric and Size Frequency Characteristics in Photographic Emulsion Series in The Photographic Journal, Volume LXXIX, 1939, pages 330 through 338.The aforementioned uniform size distribution of silver halide grains is a characteristic of the grains in monodispersed photographic silver halide emulsions Silver halide grains having a narrow size distribution can be obtained by controlling the conditions at which the silver halide grains are prepared using a double run procedure. In such a procedure, the silver halide grains are prepared by simultaneously running an aqueous solution of a silver salt, such as silver nitrate, and an aqueous solution of a water soluble halide, for example, an alkali metal halide such as potassium bromide, into a rapidly agitated aqueous solution of a silver halide peptizer, preferably gelatin, a gelatin derivative or some other protein peptizer.Suitable methods for preparing photographic silver halide emulsions having the required uniform particle size are disclosed in an article entitled Ia Properties of PhotographicEmulsion Grains , by Klein and Moisar, The Journal of Photographic Science, Volume 12, 1964, pages 242 through 2519 an article entitled The Spectral Sensitization of Silver Bromide Emulsions on DifferentCrystallographic Faces , by Markocki, The Journal ofPhotographic Science, Volume 13, 1965, pages s5 through 89 an article entitled Studies on SilverBromide Sols, Part I. The Formation and Aging ofMonodispersed Silver Bromide Sols , by Ottewill andWoodbridge, The Journal of Photographic Science,Volume 13, 19659 pages 98 through 103 and an article entitled Studies on Silver Bromide Sols, Part II.The Effect of Additives on the Sol Particles , byOttewill and Woodbridge, The Journal of PhotographicScience, Volume 13, 1965, pages 104 through 107. Where internal latent image sites have been formed through internal chemical sensitization or the use of metal dopants, the surface of the silver halide grains can be sensitized to a level below that which will produce substantial density in a surface developer i.e. less than 0.4 when coated, exposed and surface developed as described above .The silver halide grains are preferably predominantly silver bromide grains chemically surface sensitized to a level which would provide a maximum density of at least 0.5 using undoped silver halide grains of the same size and halide composition when coated, exposed and developed as described above. Surface chemical sensitization can be undertaken using techniques such as those disclosed bySheppard, Waller et al, McVeigh or Dunn, cited above. The silver halide grains can also be surface sensitized with salts of the noble metals, such as ruthenium, palladium and platinum. Representative compounds are ammonium chloropalladate, potassium chloroplatinate and sodium chloropalladite, which are used for sensitizing in amounts below that which produces any substantial fog inhibition, as described in Smith and Trivelli, U.S. Patent 2,448,û60, and as antifoggants in higher amounts, as described inTrivelli and Smith, U.S. Patent 2,566,245 and U.S.Patent 2,566,263. The silver halide grains can also be chemically sensitized with reducing agents, such as stannous salts Carroll, U.S. Patent 2,487,850 , polyamines, such as diethylene triamine Lowe et al,U.S. Patent 2,518,698 , polyamines, such as spermine Lowe et al, U.S. Patent 2,521,925 , or bist6 amino ethya ulphide and its water soluble salts CLowe et al,U.S. Patent 2,521,926 . The photographic silver halide emulsions of the invention can contain various colloid alone or in combination as vehicles. Suitable hydrophilic materials include such colloidal materials as proteins protein derivatives, cellulose derivatives such as cellulose esters and gelatin, alkali treated gelatin cattle bone or hide gelatin or acid treated gelatin pigskin gelatin , gelatin derivatives, acetylated gelatin, phthalated gelatin, polysaccharides such as dextran, gum arabic, zein, casein, pectin, collagen derivatives, collodion, agar agar, arrowroot and albumin. The nucleated silver halide emulsions of the invention can be coated as layers on a wide variety of photographic supports to prepare photographic elements. Typical useful photographic supports include polymeric film, wood fibre such as paper, metallic sheet and foil, glass and ceramic supporting elements provided with one or more subbing layers to enhance the adhesive, antistatic, dimensional, abrasive, hardness, frictional, antihalation and or other properties of the support surface. Typical useful polymeric film supports are films of cellulose nitrate and cellulose esters, such as cellulose triacetate and diacetate, polystyrene, polyamides, homo and co polymers of vinyl chloride, poly vinyl acetal , polycarbonate, homo and co polymers of olefins, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, and polyesters of dibasic aromatic carboxylic acids with divalent alcohols, such as poly ethylene terephthalate . Typical useful paper supports are those which are partially acetylated or coated with baryta and or a polyolefin, particularly a polymer of an a olefin containing 2 to 10 carbon atoms, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, copolymers of ethylene and propylene and the like. In a preferred form of this invention, the 3,3disubstituted arylhydrazinophenylthiourea nucleating agents are employed in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 500 mg of adsorbed nucleating agent per mole of silver halide in the emulsion. Preferably, 1 to 10Q mg of adsorbed nucleating agent per mole of silver halide is employed. Optimum concentrations can, of course, vary somewhat from one application to another. Where the 3,3 disubstituted arylhydrazinophenylthiourea nucleating agent is to be adsorbed to the surface of the silver halide grains, it can be adsorbed using the procedures well known to those skilled in the art for adsorbing sensitizing dyes, such as cyanine and merocyanine dyes, to the surface of silver halide grains. A simple exposure and development process can be used to form a direct positive image. In one embodiment, a photographic element comprising at least one layer of a silver halide emulsion as described above can be imagewise exposed and then developed in a silver halide surface developer. It is understood that the term surface developer encompasses those developers which will reveal the surface latent image on a silver halide grain, but will not reveal substantial internal latent image in an internal image forming emulsion, and under the conditions generally used develop a surface sensitive silver halide emulsion. The surface developers can generally utilize any of the conventional photographic silver halide developing agents or reducing agents, but the developing bath or composition is generally substantially free of a silver halide solvent e.g. water soluble thiocyanates, water soluble thioethers, thiosulphates and ammonia which will disrupt or dissolve the grain to reveal substantial internal image.Low amounts of excess halide are sometimes desirable in the developer or incorporated in the emulsion as halide releasing compounds, but high amounts of iodide or iodide releasing compounds are generally avoided to prevent substantial disruption of the grain. Typical silver halide developing agents which can be used in the developing compost tions of this invention include hydroquinones, catechols, aminophenols, 3 pyrazolidones, ascorbic acid and its derivatives, reductones, phenylenediamines and the like, or combinations thereof. Illustrative of useful surface developers are those disclosed in loves U.S. Patent 2,563,785 Evans U.S. Patent 3,761,276 Knott et al U.S.Patent 2,456,953 and Juoy U.S. Patent 3,511,662. Where the developing agents are initially partly or entirely incorporated in the photographic elements, the remaining components e.g., water, activators to adjust pH and preservatives conventionally present in surface developers constitute what is commonly referred to as an activator solution. Except for the omission of part or all of the developing agent, activator solutions are identical to developer solutions in composition and are employed when the developing agent is incorporated in the photographic element.Subsequent references herein to developing compositions are inclusive of both developer and activator solutions. Photographic elements containing monosubstituted acylhydrazinophenylthioureas are preferably processed with developing compositions having a pH at or above 13.5. At lower pH levels the nucleating activity of monosubstituted acylhydrazinophenyl thioureas is significantly diminished. We have now found that 3,3 disubstituted acylhydrazinophenylthioureas retain to a relatively high degree their nucleating activity when employed with developing compositions at pH levels down to and below 12.0. In addition to being useful at higher pH levels conventionally employed with monosubstituted acylhydrazinophenylthioureas, typically in the range of from 13.5 to 13.9 the 3,3disubstituted acylhydrazinophenylthioureas are useful at pH levels as low as 11.8 and, depending upon the specific form of the photographic element employed, even lower. It is frequently desirable to lower developing composition pH levels to reduce the potential hazard which the higher pH levels entail if the developing compositions are carelessly or otherwise improperly handled.For such applications, it is specifically preferred to employ developing compositions in the lower pH ranges, of from about 12.0 to 13.0, in processing hotographic elementsaccording to this invention containing 3,3 disubstituted acyl phenylhydrazinophenylthioureas. The developing compositions used in the process of this invention can contain certain antifoggants and development restrainers, or, optionally, they can be incorporated in layers of the photographic element.For example, in some applications, improved results can be obtained when the direct positive emulsions are processed in the presence of certain antifoggants, as disclosed in Stauffer U.S. Patent 2,497,917. Typical useful antifoggants include benzotriazoles, such as benzotriazole, 5 methylbenzotriazole, and 5 ethylbenzotriazole, benzimidazoles such as 5 nitrobenzimidazole, benzothiazoles such as 5 nitrobenzothiazole and 5 methylbenzothiazole, heterocyclic thiones such as l methyl 2 tetrazoline 5 thione, triazines such as 2,4 dimethylamino 6 chloro 5 triazine, benzoxazoles such as ethylbenzoxazole and pyrroles such as 2,5 dimethylpyrrole. In certain embodiments, good results are obtained when the elements are processed in the presence of high levels of the antifoggants mentioned above.When antifoggants such as benzotriazoles are used, good results can be obtained when the processing solution contains 500 mg to 10 grams per litre, and preferably 1 to 5 grams per litre. When the antifoggants are incorporated in the photographic element, concentrations of 5 to 500 mg. per mole of silver halide and preferably concentrations of 10 to 150 mg per mole of silver halide, are employed.Optimum antifoggant concentrations vary with the particular photographic element and processing solution. A variety of features that can be used in conjunction with the invention are disclosed in ResearchDisclosure, Volume 176, December 1978, Item 17643, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference, particularly Paragraph II, Emulsion Washing Paragraph IV, Spectral Sensitization and Desensitization Paragraph V, Brighteners Paragraph VI, Antifoggants and Stabilizers Paragraph VIII, Absorbing andScattering Materials, Paragraph X, Hardeners Paragraph XI, Coating Aids Paragraph XII, Plasticizers and Lubricants Paragraph XIII, Antistatic Layers Paragraph XIV, Methods of Addition, Paragraph XV,Coating and Drying Procedures Paragraph XVI, MattingAgents Paragraph XVIII, Exposure Paragraph XX,Developing Agents and Paragraph XXI, DevelopmentModifiers. The 3,3 disubstituted acylhydrazino.phenylthiourea nucleating agents can be used with other conventional nucleating agents. In a preferred form one or a combination of 3,3 disubstituted acylhydrazinophenylthiourea nucleating agents are employed at a concentration of up to about 200 mg per mole of silver in. combination with a conventional substituted hydrazine type nucleating agent which is present in a concentration of from about 200 mg to about 2 grams per mole of silver. Conventional nucleating agents that can be used in combination with the 3,3 disubstituted acylhydrazinophenylthiourea nucleating agents employed in the invention are disclosed in U.S. Patents 2,011,391 2,012,11113 3,719,494 3,734,738 3,615,615 3,759,901 4,115,192 4,030,925 11,080,207 3,708,302 and 3,869,286. The silver halide emulsions of the invention can be spectrally sensitized with cyanine, merocyanine, and other polymethine dyes and supersensitizing combinations thereof well known in the art. Spectral sensitizers. in conventional surface sensitive emulsions are comparably effective in the emulsions of this invent ion. In general, they enhance nucleation. Nonionic, zwitterionic and anionic spectral sensitizers are preferred. Particularly effective are carboxysubstituted merocyanine dyes of the thiohydantoin type described by Stauffer and Spence U.S. Patent 2,1190,758. Supersensitizing dye combinations having polarographic oxidation potentials Eox of about 0.3 to 0.9 volt can be used in the emulsion of the invention.Such combinations are described in U.S. Patents 2,075,048 2,313,922 2,533,426 2,704,714 2,704,717 2,688,545 and 3,672,898. Particularly effective supersensitizing combinations are described in U.S.Patents 3,397,06.0 2,688,545 2,7Q1,198 and 2,973,264. Photographic elements containing the nucleated silver halide emulsions of the invention are preferably colour photographic elements which form dye images through the selective destruction, formation or physical removal of dyes. Such photographic elements can produce dye images through the selective destruction of dyes or dye precursors, such as conventional silver dye bleach processes. The photographic elements can produce dye images through the selective formation of dyes, such as by reacting coupling a colour developing agent e.g., a primary aromatic amine in its oxidized form with a dye forming coupler. The dye forming couplers can be incorporated in the photographic elements.In one form, the dye forming couplers can be chosen to form subtractive primary i.e., yellow, magenta and cyan image dyes and are nondiffusible, colourless couplers, such as twoand four equivalent couplers of the open chain ketomethylene, pyrazolone, pyrazolotriazole, pyrazolobenzimidazole, phenol and naphthol type hydrophobically ballasted for incorporation in high boiling organic coupler solvents. The photographic elements can incorporate known alkali soluble ballasted couplers.The photographic elements can be adapted to form nondiffusible image dyes using dye forming couplers in developers. The dye forming couplers upon coupling can release photographically useful fragments, such as development inhibitors or accelerators, bleach accelerators, developing agents, silver halide solvents, toners, hardeners, fogging agents, antifoggants, competing couplers, chemical or spectral sensitizers and desensitizers. The photographic elements can also containcoloured dye forming couplers, such as those employed to form integral masks for negative colour images. Also the photographic elements can produce dye images through the selective removal of dyes.Negative or positive dye images can be produced by the immobilization or mobilization of incorporated colourproviding substances as a function of exposure and development The nucleated silver halide emulsions of the invention particularly useful In photographic elements used in image transfer systems Suitable image transfer systems include colloid transfer systems, as illustrated by Yutzy et al, U.S.Patents 2n596,766 and 2,7I6O59 imbibition transfer systems, as illustrated by Mlnsk, U.S. Patent 2,882,156 andcolbur image transfer systems, as illustrated by Research Disclosure, Volume 151,November 1976, Item 151623 and Volume 123, July 1974,Item 12331.
