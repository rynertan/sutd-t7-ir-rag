# CONTROL FOR SLURRY PROCESSING SYSTEM

## Abstract
In a variable speed system for dispersing, milling or otherwise processing solid particles in liquid, a control unit 24 automatically resets an adjustable pully combination 18 to a slow start up position to prevent damage to the sys tem drive train during initiation of a processing operation. In addition, the control unit allows a system operator to pre cisely and safely adjust the setting of the pully combination to control the speed of the processing operation. In one ar rangement the speed is controlled by manually operated valves 96 and 98 that control fluid pressure on opposite sides of a piston 56 that controls the pully combination. In another arrangement, valves 156, 160 automatically con trol fluid pressure on the piston 62 to maintain a position in response to a signal froin a pressure regulator 120 which is manually or otherwise adjusted to provide a selected speed.
