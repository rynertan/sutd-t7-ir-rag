# Method for the preparation of fiber reinforced metal composite material.

## Abstract
A process for preparing a fiber reinforced metal compo site material which comprises 1 combining an inorganic fiber comprising alumina as the main component and silica as the secondary component with an aluminium alloy containing at least one of copper, silicon, magnesium and zinc as the secondary component at a temperature of not lower than the melting point of said alloy to make a composite, 2 subjecting said composite to solid solution treatment, 3 quenching the treated composite and 4 optionally tempering the quenched composite at a tempera ture of from 100 to 250 C.
