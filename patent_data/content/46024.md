## Description
EARTH LEAKAGE CURRENT BREAKER This invention relates to earth leakage current breakers. The usual form of earth leakage current breakers used in domestic premises is an electromechanical device which is set to trip, and thereby interrupt the current supply to a circuit, if a leakage current to earth exceeds some predetermined value. Modern practice for earth leakage circuit breakers in domestic premises is commonly to have a sensitivity of either 100 mA or 30 mA with a tripping time of about 30 ms. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved form of earth leakage current breaker which enables high sensitivity to be obtained with a high speed of operation and which avoids the necessity of having a mechanical device. According to this invention, an earth leakage current breaker comprises current transformer means coupled to the live and neutral lines og an alternating supply to provide an analogue output signal representative of the difference between the total current in the live line or lines and the current in the neutral line, pulse sampling means arranged for repetitively sampling the magnitude of said analogue output signal, digital data processing means responsive to the output of the pulse sampling means and operative to provide a control signal if the sampled magnitude exceeds a predetermined level a number n of times in a predetermined period, where n is an integer greater than 1, and solid state switching means controlled by said control signal and arranged for interrupting the current through said supply line or lines.Typically n might be chosen as 2 so that the supply is interrupted if two samples exceed some predetermined value, e.g. 20 m.amps, in a period of say one half cycle of the mains frequency. Thus a single current pulse in this period, such as might occur because of a switching transient or the like, would not operate the switching means but two samples, whether successive or not, in one half cycle of the supply frequency, that is 10 milliseconds would effect the required switching. A leakage current can only be detected when the balance current, represented by the aforesa d analogue output signal i8 swt pled. Thus the sampling rate is chosen to ensure that the current is detected quickly typically the sampling rate might be of the order of eight samples per cycle of the supply. The supply rate need not be synchronised with the supply frequency. To avoid operation on a single transient the sampling rate should be such that n samples are made in a time which is greater than, preferably at least twice, the time duration of a transient.The digital data processing system may be arranged to count sampled inputs exceeding the predetermined level and to operate the switching means as soon as the count reaches n, the counting means being reset periodically, say every half cycle. In some cases, however, instead of operating the switches when the count n is reached, to await the end of the count period, e.g. a half cycle, and then compare the accumulated count with the value n to determine if switch operation is to be effected.The time duration before resetting the counter is not critical and conveniently is made of the same order as the time required to effect a switching operation, which, with present day solid State switching eans, is of the order of 10 milliseconds, f.e, half cycle at the supply frequency, By this technique, it is possible to detect an earth leakage current exceeding some predetermined Limit, which may readily pea very low limit, e.g.a few milliamperes, within a very short time, with a fraction of a cycle at the supply frequency, the rapidity of detection being limited primarily by the requirement to discriminate against transients. The speed of detection and operation however can readily be made much faster than existing mechanical types of earth current operated circuit breakers. In a single phase supply, the difference between the current in the live line and the neutral line is the leakage current, This may be detected by making use of two current transformers, one on the line line and one on the neutral line and analogue means obtaining the difference of their outputs, for example using an operational amplifier.Preferably however a single current transformer is coupled to both the live and neutral lines, for example by looping both the live and neutral input around an output coil or a core of the transformer or by using a toroidal transformer encompas,sing both lines, Xn a t.hXee phase supply, four current transformers may be employed, one on each of the live lines and one on the neutral with analogue means, e.g. an operational amplifier, for humming their outputs.Preferably however a single current transformer is coupled to all the lines for example by having the separate live lines and neutral line looped around an output coil or a core of the transformer or by using a toroidal core encompassing all the conductors. The digital data processing means is conveniently a microprocessor. Such a microprocessor may be used in conjunction with a current transformer and a voltage transformer for other purposes, e.g. to form a kilowatt hour meter measuring energy consumption.Thus a large part of the apparatus of the present invention may be common to a kilowatt hour meter. The analogue output representing the balance current may be pulse sampled by the microprocessor to obtain a control signal for one or more solid state switches for interrupting the supply. These switches conveniently are triacs or thyristor pairs. Means may be provided for adjusting the level of leakage current at which the switch is operated. If an earth leakage fault occurs, in some cases it may be desirable that a check should be made to ascertain the cause of the fault before the supply is restored in these circumstances no automatic reset would be provided after the supply is interrupted,Manually operable reset means may thus be provided for restoring the supply when it is safe to do so. With the high speed of operation provided by the present invention, more generally it may be preferred to provide means for automatically re closing the switching means to restore the supply, with a predetermined delay, after the switching means is operated on detection of the earth leakage current. The delay might typically be a few seconds, e.g. 5 or 6 seconds, and provision may be made for adjusting this delay. If an earth leakage fault is still present, the apparatus of the present invention will immediately come into operation to interrupt the supply again. In the following description, reference will be made to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a block diagram illustrating diagrammatically one form of earth leakage current breaker Figure 2 is a graphical diagram for explanatory purposes and Figures 3 and 4 are diagrams illustrating modifications of parts of the apparatus of Figure 1. Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a three phase supply comprising live lines Q, 11 and 12 with a neutral 13 for supplying power to a load indicated diagrammatically at 14. In the leads 10, 11 and 12 there are solid state switches 15, 16, 17 respectively, e.g. triacs, which are controlled by output signals from a control unit 20 via an optical isolator 21. Around the leads 10 to 13 is a single current transformer 22 in the form of a toroid linked to all the supply leads and providing an output voltage on a winding 23 representative of the out of balance currents in the leads 10 to 13, that is to say the vector sum of the three line currents in leads 10 to 12 less the neutral current in lead 13. This out of balance current is thus the earth leakage current. The magnitude of this voltage on winding 23 is sampled by a pulse sampler 24 controlled by a clock 25 and, in this particular embodiment, effecting sampling regularly and repetitively at a frequency such that 8 samples are mÅade in the time duration of 1 cycle of the supply, i.e. 20 milliseconds. The sampled magnitude is applied to a comparator 26 which gives a pulse output on lead 19 whenever the magnitude exceeds a predetermined level corresponding to the magnitude of leakage current, e.g. 10 milliamperes, which is to be detected. The comparator 26, in this embodiment is arranged to respond to voltages of either polarity provided their magnitude either positive or negative is above a predetermined positive value or below a predetermined negative value.The pulses on lead 26 are counted in a counter 27 which is reset periodicially, e.g. after every four sampling pulses. The reset need notbe synchronised with the supply but, in this particular case, the reset will be substantially every half cycle of the sample.In this particular embodiment, if the count in the counter 27 reaches two, a signal is fed from the counter 27 to the control unit 20 to operate the switches 15, 16 and 17. in some cases, instead of operating the switches when the count reaches 2, it may be preferred to await the end of the count period and then compare the accumulated current with n to determine if switch operation is required. The comparator 26 preferably is a digital comparator, the analogue samples each being converted to digital form by an analogue to digital converter 28 before being compared with the reference level which, in this case, is in digital form. Referring to Figure 2, at a there is shown a current waveform 30, representing the out of balance current.For a three phase supply, such a current waveform is very irregular. This waveform is sampled periodically, at time intstants marked tl, t2, t3 etc. The sampling is repetitive and, as stated above, might be at a rate of 8 samples every 20 milliseconds. Provided, as in a , at all the sampling points the magnitude is below the predetermined level indicated by the dashed line 31, representing the leakage current level at which switching is required, the counter will not record any count. If, as shown at b , the waveform 32 has a short duration transient 33 of large magnitude, this will be detected by the comparator hut, because of the short duration, only a single count will be recorded before the counter is reset.If an earth leakage fault occurs, then as shown at c , the amplitude of waveform 34 exceeds the limits at more than two sampling points before the counter is reset, then the switching means is operated to switch off the supply. Instead of a single current transformer 22, it is possible, as shown in Figure 3, to provide on the leads 10 to 12, between the switches 16 to 18 and the load, separate current transformers 45, 46 and 47 and to provide on lead 13 a current transformer 48. These current transformers are all connected to an operatfonal amplifier 49 forming a humming amplifier summing the analogue outputs of the current transformers in such a manner as to give the difference between the vector sum of the currents through the three live leads 10, 11, 12 and the current through theneutral lead 13. This current difference is an analogue output signal representative of the earth leakage current in the load circuit beyond the current transformers.The output signal is an analogue waveform which is sampled as described with reference to Figure 1. For many loads, a single phase current only is used and in this case the difference between the live line current and the neutral current will always represent the earth leakage current if there is an earth fault.This may be detected using a current balance transformer as described with reference to Figure 1 or by analogue summing of the outputs of two current transformers. With a three phase or a single phase supply, instead of having a single toroidal core or coil around all the supply leads, it is alternatively possible to couple these leads inductively to an output winding, e.g.by looping the supply leads around this winding or around a core carrying this winding. Such an arrangement is illustrated in Figure 4 for a single phase supply, the live and neutral lines are arranged as loops 50, 51 around a coil 52 feeding the pulse sampler 24. The comparator, pulse sampler, counter and logic control of the switches may conveniently be effected in a microprocessor. This ts particularly convenient where a microprocessor is utilised also for other purposes, e.g. for metering energy consumption.
