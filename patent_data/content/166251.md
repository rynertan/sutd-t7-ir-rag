# INFERENCE SYSTEM AND METHOD

## Abstract
The system comprises an input section 20 , a knowledge accumulation section 18 , a work domain section 16 , stor age means 14 and inference processing means 12 . Attribu tive information is supplemented in a knowledge unit for the purpose of smooth execution of inference, and a knowledge base is constructed with this pair as the building unit. In con nection with this, functions that are in response to the pur pose, such as selection or rejection of a knowledge unit and al teration in the order of search, are added to the interference organ 12 , based on the attributive information. Employed as an attributive information is, for example, the information on the frequency of use of each knowledge unit. The inference or gan 12 renews the information on the frequency of use for every use of each knowledge unit. In addition, a storage space 14 is allocated to each knowledge unit based on the informa tion on the frequency of use. This means, for example, that a knowledge unit with higher frequency of use is stored in an area of the inference organ that may be accessed with ease the core memory or the like .
