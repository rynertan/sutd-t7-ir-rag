# One step write circuit arrangement for EEPROMS.

## Abstract
A novel write circuit arrangement for an EEPROM type memory system operable in response to the difference bet ween the information stored in each addressed cell and the information to the be stored therein during a writing cycle and writing information into only those addressed cells for which a difference exists regardless of whether the difference indi cates to charge or discharge the cell. The arrangement also can simultaneously charge one cell of a byte while discharg ing another cell of the same byte.
