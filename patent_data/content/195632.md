# Spraying equipment.

## Abstract
Spraying equipment, for example for herbicides, com prises a head for carrying a rotatable disc from which, in operation, fluid is delivered by centrifugal force. The head comprises a first component 4 and a second component 2 which are relatively dispiaceable about an axis A . The first component 4 has an inlet aperture 33 and the second component 2 has an outlet aperture 40 . the second component 2 also has a recess 44 which provides a passage connecting the inlet aperture 33 to the outlet aperture 40 . Relative rotational displacement of the compo nents 2,4 varies the length and or the flow cross section of the passage, so as to regulate the flow of fluid to the rotatable disc.
