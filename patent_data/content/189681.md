## Description
DESCRIPTION .GENERATOR APPARATUS EMPLOYING FLUID FLOW This invention relates to a generator apparatus employing fluid flow.. A variety of energy saving measures have recently been considered from the economictvlewpoint of of various kinds of energy. For examp1e, in working places where fossil fuels such as h,eayy oti are burned to provide a heat source, various devices have been contrived in order to efficiently burn even low quality fuel.Among these devices, methods of extending a flue further upward or forcedly exhausting waste gases are commonly practised, and are also widely adopted for cooling purposes in summer, fdr example. However, it is expensive to provide exhaust equipment and subsequently keep the equipment operating, and, additionally,. exhaust gases are discharged into the tmosphere in a state wherein a large amount of energy remains therein. In other applications, such as supplying water for irrigation, various kinds of power operated liquid pumps are employed wherein water is pumped and purified within one and the same liquid storage tank, or water is transferred from a liquid storage tank to another tank. In a liquid pump of the type wherein the liquid transfer mechanism is such that the liquid is drawn up through a suction pipe by using power and then falls through a discharge pipe by virtue of gravitational force, however, in spite of the fact that the amount of kinetic energy which is in proportion to the head of the liquid can be obtained while the liquid is falling, no pump has been put on the market which employs a means of recovering the kinetic energy for re use purposes. It follows that the energy is wastefully discharged without being re used.Thus, under the present day energy conditions, attention has recently been given to the recovery of the energy thus discharged. Furthermore, the operation of a hydroelectric power generator, one of the conventional power generating systems, is. such that kinetic energy is given to water by virtue of the head of the water or by gravitational force, the water. thus energized strikes the vaned wheel of a hydraulic turbine, and the vaned wheel is rotated to turn a dynamo, thereby producing electric power. However, since the water is drained off with a considerable amount of kinetic energy remaining therein, electric power cannot be stably produced without a continuous supply of water having the required level of kinetic energy. Accordingly, in districts which employ shallow water sources, hydroelectric power generation not only leads to a waste of natural resources, but also eptaLls the risk of suffering problems or failure in the electricity generating systems as soon as those districts are hit by a drought or other natural disaster. It is a principal object of the present invention to provide a solution to the aforegoing problems of conventional apparatus. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a generator apparatus employing a fluid flow characterised by the combination of a flow passage for a fluid such as a gaseous body or a liquid, at least one vaned wheel which is disposed such that it can be rotated by the kinetic energy of a fluid flowing in said flow passage, at least one flywheel mounted on the shaft of said vaned wheel and a dynamo which adjoins the periphery of said flywheel and which rotates to produce electricity. The present invention also provides an exhauster device which is equipped with an energy recovery function, comprising one or more tubular suction portions having a hollow shape and whose one end is provided with a suction port and whose other end is provided with an exhaust port such as to form a flow passage for a fluid, such as exhaust gases a delivery section which is constituted by one or more vaned wheels disposed such as to project into the flow passage formed within the said tubular suction portions such that the fluid can be positively delivered by means of a drive means using an energy source which is disposed in close vicinity to the above mentioned suction port and one or more recovery sections distributed on the downstream side of the delivery section wherein a number of vaned wheels project into the flow passage such that they can be rotated by the kinetic energy of the fluid flowing through the tubular suction portion and are then discharged out, of a tubular exhaust portion through its exhaust port characterized in that a given number of said recovery sections are constructed .in such a manner that a given number of dynamos are driven by means of a given number of flywheels which are turned by the vaned wheels to generate electric power, thereby enabling the recovery of the electric power for reuse as an energy source. In the above described arrangement, the exhaust gases drawn in through the suction port are given kinetic energy by the delivery section which is disposed near the suction port in such a manner that the vaned wheel thereof is projects into the flow passage. The fluid thus energized flows toward the exhaust port through a given number of suction tubular portions. and strikes the vaned wheels of the recovery section for driving each dynamo, so as to rotate the dynamos. When the exhaust gases strike and rotate each vaned wheel, they lose part of their kinetic energy. The foregoing gases continue to flow, and, when they strike and rotate the vaned wheel of the next stage they again lose part of their residual kinetic energy.In this manner, the vaned wheels, which are disposed such as to form a given number of stages, are sequentially rotated by part of the kinetic energy, thereby enabling the recovery of the kinetic energyin the form of electric power. The exhaust gases are finally discharged into the atmosphere in a state wherein a greater part of the energy contained therein is lost. Some embodiments can be provided with an upper liquid storage portion which is equipped with a suction unit driven by a desired energy source, such as electricity, gas, gasoline, or water power, to thereby enable the suction of a given liquid a given number of suction pipes which are connected to the liquid storage portion in such a manner that suction ports are positioned in the liquid such as to enable the suction of the liquid into the liquid storage portion a given number of discharge pipes whose lower ends are provided with respective discharge ports which are connected to the liquid storage portion such that the sucked liquid can be discharged into a lower liquid tank after the liquid has been stored in the upper liquid portion and .a given number of vaned wheels which are disposed in the flow passage formed by the fluid flowing in the discharge pipes such that they can be rotated by the kinetic energy of the liquid which falls through the discharge pipes so as to be discharged into the lower liquid tank and dynamos which are driven by a given number of flywheels which are rotated by the vaned wheels so as to produce electricity, the electric power thus produced being recovered for re use as an energy source. Referring now to the operation of the latter arrangement, when a given liquid is sucked from a liquid tank located below by means of the liquid pump of this the suction unit is operated, and the liquid within the, liquid storage tank is then sucked through the suction ports of the suction, pipes which are disposed in the lower liquid tank, thus forming a flow passage which enters the liquid storage portion against the resistance of a first checkvalve. As the sucked liquid is taken into the liquid storage portion, its potential energy is gradually increased. Next, to state it briefly, the liquid having the increased potential energy forms a flow passage and enters the discharge pipe against the resistance of a second checkvalve provided in the liquid storage portion, by means of the pumping action of the suction unit. The liquid is delivered into the discharge pipe through the flow passage, and then falls at a gradually increasing speed through the pipe while its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The falling liquid strikes the liquid receiving members of the vaned wheel which is disposed in the flow passage formed in the discharge pipe, and thereby transmits part of its kinetic energy to the vaned wheel. While the liquid continues to fall, it recovers the amount of kinetic energy equal the potential energy lost.Near the position wherein the liquid restores its lost kinetic energy, another vaned wheel is rotatably arranged such as to project into the flow passage, in the same manner as described above, so that the liquid strikes the liquid receiving members thereof. The liquid again loses part of its residual kinetic energy, and continues to flow downward. Further vaned wheels may be disposed near the position wherein the liquid restores part of its lost kinetic energy, theregby enablingIthe recovery of energy which is not achieved by conventional methods. In some embodiments a power source and a rotary flow are used to rotate a given number of vaned wheels which are rotatably disposed in a flow passage formed by the rotary motion of the fluid within the liquid storage tank, and a given number of flywheels which are disposed outside the liquid storage tank and coaxially therewith. Thus, electricity is efficiently generated by using the rotary flow and the inertia of each flywheel. In addition, the inside of the liquid storage tank or that of a container accommodating all of the components of the apparatus, can be kept at normal atmospheric pressure or evacuated1 and, under this latter condition, each vaned wheel is so rotated as to efficiently utilize its rotational energy in the low pressure, low temperature conduction region.Moreover, a considerable amount of residual kinetic energy is re used repeatedly instead of being discharged, thereby enabling the efficient utilization of resources for electric power generation. Other embodiments comprise the combination of a vertical shaft which is immersed into a given liquid such as water, which is supplied into a liquid storage tank having the cross sectional shape of a shallow funnel in such a manner as to be substantially tangential with respect to the rotary flow a given number of vaned wheels which are disposed at the lower end of the vertical shaft such that they can rotate therewith a power transmission section and flywheels which are pivoted on the upper portion of the vertical shaft and a given number of dynamos which rotatably adjoin the periphery of each flywheel the vaned wheels being rotated by means of the power transmission section driven by a given power source such as a motor thereby to produce the rotary flow of a given liquid contained in the liquid storage tank so that a flow passage is formed by the rotary motion of the liquid the supplied flow and the rotary flow which intermingle in the flow passage, as well as the inertias of the flywheels . which maintaini.the . rotary motion of the vaned wheels which are mounted coaxially with respect to the flywheels, thereby enabling the above mentioned dynamos to produce electricity and the re use of the supplied flcs for the purpose of efficiently utilizing resources r alternatively, the ent3retr of the liletabers described above or the inside of the liquid storage tank alone being evacuated at least the vaned wheels being rotated in the vacuum region by means of the above noted power transmission section driven by the given power source, thereby causing the given liquid to form a rotary flow which produces a flow passage with the result that the rotary flow, the supplied flow and the inertia of the vaned wheel can be utilized more efficiently as compared to the conditions obtained using these components under atmospheric pressure. Thus, the vertical shaft, the vaned wheel and the flywheel are rotated by means of the power transmission section driven by a given power source. The liquid is preferably supplied into the liquid storage tank after the vaned wheel has started to rotate since the resistance to the start up of the vanedwheel becomes abnormally high if the liquid is stored in the tank before the wheel starts to rotate.The main factors which interfere with the rotary motion of the vertical shaft are the inertial resistance of the flywheel and the resistance to the start up of the dynamos adjoining the periphery of the flywheel due to the fact that the supplied flow is fed substantially in the direction of rotation of the rotary flow, with the result that the rotational speed rises relatively quickly and, since the supplied flow starts acting to push the vaned wheel in the meantime, the dynamos generate a required amount of electromotive force. r In this state, the above mentioned power supply is turned off, and subsequently, the supplied flow substantially compensates for the inertia of the rotary flow of the liquid. The speed of the rotary flow is regulated below an approximately constant value either by controlling a supply valve or a drain valve in such a manner as to deliver the amount of the liquid equal to the supply into the lower stage liquid storage tank or by occasionally operating a given power source. The invention is described further hereinafter, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings whereia Fig. 1 is a longitudinal side sectional side view illustrating an e nbodiment wherein three vaned wheels are disposed in the flow passage for a fluid such that a gaseous body flows from bottom to top Fig. 2 is a longitudinal sectional view taken on the line II II of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a partially cutaway side elevational view showing an embodiment wherein two vaned wheels are respectively disposed in three flow passages, whose upper portions are integrally joined such that a gaseous body flows from bottom to top Fig. 4 is a front view showing an embodiment wherein two vaned wheels are disposed in the flow passage which is formed by the downward flow of the fluid through a delivery pipe connected to the upper liquid storage chamber Fig. 5 is an enlarged, longitudinal sectional viewof the generator apparatus in Fig. 4 Fig. 6 is a front elevation, partially in section, of part of the generator apparatus in Fig. 5 Fig. 7 is a longitudinal sectional view showing the construction wherein, in the wase of Fig. 4, a second liquid storage chamber which communicates with a first liquid storage chamber located above it is disposed on the downstream side, and a delivery pipe is connected to the second liquid storage chamber Fig. 8 is a partially cutaway front elevation showing an embodiment having a plurality of suction pipes for supplying a fluid to the first liquid storage chamber and having a plurality of the above mentioned deliver pipes from the second liquid storage chamber Fig. 9 is a partially cutaway front elevation showing the case wherein the second liquid storage chamber ofFig. 8 is formed with the cross sectional shaDe of a shallow funnel with vertical side walls and communicates with the first liquid storage chamber with a plurality of delivery pipes connected to the second chamber Fig. 10 is a partially cutaway perspective view showing.an essential portion of an embodiment which is constructed in such a manner as to dispose a vaned wheel in the liquid storage tank in which a flow passage is formed by the rotary flow of a fluid Fig. 11 is a schematic illustration showing an embodiment which uses two units of the apparatus of Fig. 10 which are coupled with each other Fig. 12 is a partially cutaway perspective view showing an essential portion of an embodiment which is constructed such that the apparatus of Fig. 10 is hermetically sealed by disposing a lid over the liquid storage tank, and the entire unit is housed in the container whose internal pressure can be reduced and Fig. 13 is a perspective view, partially broken away, showing one embodiment of a flywheel assembly consisting of a plurality of flywheels.Description of the Preferred Embodiments Figs. 1 and 2 show an exhauster device 1 for a gaseous body which is equipped with energy recovering capabilities, the exhaust device 1 having a vertical tubular structure comprising tubular suction portion 2 having a hollow body of a given sectional shape and an tubular exhaust portion 3 of the same shape which extends upward of the portion 2. A suction port 4 is formed at the lower end of the tubular section portion 2 while an exhaust port 5 is formed at the upper end of the tubular exhaust portion 3. A flow path 6 of a fluid is formed through the exhaust device 1 by the flow of a gaseous body which is supplied via the suction port 4 and is exhausted through the exhaust port 5.A delivery device 7 for delivering the gaseous body is disposed near the suction port 4 and comprises a vaned wheel 8 which extends into the flow passage 6 and is housed in a casing 9 formed integrally with the tubular section portion 2, a shaft 10 of the wheel being pivotally supported by the casing 9, with one end of the shaft 10 coupled with the drive shaft of a motor 11 installed on a base and the other end coupled with a flywheel 12. Above the delivery device 7 of the tubular section portion 2 there is disposed a first recovery device 13 comprising a vaned wheel 14 whose blade portions project into the flow path 6, the vaned wheel 14 being housed in a casing 15 which is formed integrally with the tubular suction portion 2. A shaft 16 of the vaned wheel 14 is pivotally supported by the casing 15. Two flywheels 17 having pneumatic tyres fitted onto their periphery are mounted on the two ends of the shaft 16, respectively, the peripheries of the flywheels 17 engaging respective drive wheels 19 provided on the shafts of two dynamos 18, the dynamos being installed on the base in such a manner that the respective dynamos 18 can be driven by the rotary motion of the two flywheels to produce electricity. A second recovery device 20 is disposed above the first recovery device 13 and comprises a further vaned wheel 21 whose blade portions project into the flow path 6. The vaned wheel 21 is housed in a casing 22 which is formed integrally with the tubular suction portion 2 in the same manner as described above. A shaft 23 of the vaned wheel 21 is pivotally supported by the casing 22, flywheels 24 with pneumatic tyres fitted onto their periphery are mounted on both ends of the shaft 23, and the periphery of both flywheels 24 respectively engage drive wheels 26 which are provided on the shafts of dynamos 25 the latter being installed on the base such as to be capable of driving the respective dynamos 25. In the uppermost position near the exhaust port 5, a third recovery device 27 is disposed which comprises a vaned wheel 28 whose blade portions project into the Elow path 6. The vaned wheel 28 is housed in a casing 29 which is formed integrally with the tubular suction portion 2 in the same manner as described above. A shaft 30 of the vaned wheel 28 is pivotally supported by the casing 29 flywheels 31 with pneumatic tyres fitted onto their periphery are mounted on both ends of the shaft 30, and the peripheries of both flywheels dl respectively engage drive wheels 33 and 33 of dynamos 32 and 32 which are installed on the base such as to be capable of driving the respective dynamos 32 to produce electricity.The delivery device 7, the first recovery device 13, the second recovery device 20 and the third recovery device 27 are provided at symmetrically opposed positions on each side of the suction tubular portion 2 at desired intervals along the same. motor 11 is driven by the electric power which is supplied from a power supply 34 such as a storage battery and by the power which is generated by each dynamo 18, 25 and 32 and is supplied by way of conductors C1 and C2. In operating the exhauster device 1 which is constructed as described above, a fluid E, which is a gaseous body such as exhaust air, is first introduced into the suction port 4 and a starting circuit for the motor 11 is closed by a switch not shown , so that the motor 11 is driven by the power which is provided from the power supply 34, causing the vaned wheel 8 of the delivery device 7 to be rotated clockwise. Since this clockwise rotation increases the kinetic energy of the fluid E thus introdJced, the fluid E rises through the tubular suction portion 2 with such energy as to form the flow path 6 of the fluid E.Consequently, the fluid E rotates the vaned wheels 14, 21 and 28 of the respective energy recovery portions 13, 20 and 27 while consuming part of the kinetic energy which the fluid holds within itself. Finally, the fluid loses substantially all of its kinetic energy, reaches the tubular exhaust portion 3, and is then discharged from the exhaust port 5 into the atmosphere. Each energy recovery portion 13, 20 and 27 which is given kinetic energy by the fluid E in this way rotates its associated dynamo 18, 25 and 32 by means of the flywheels 17, 24 and 31 and the drive wheels 19, 26 and 33 which adjoin the flywheels so as to produce electricity. Since the electric power thus generated is supplied to the motor 11 through the conductors C1 and C2, the motor 11 is capable of continuing to run in a state wherein the power provided from the power supply 34 is greatly reduced. Also, since a pneumatic tyre is fitted onto the periphery of each flywheel 17, 24 and 31, the flywheels do not have to forcedly adjoin, the drive wheels 19, 26 and 33 of the respective motors 18, 25 and 32, whereby efficient rotary motion can be performed to effectively generate electricity. Fig. 3 illustrates another embodiment of the apparatus of this invention. In an exhauster device la wherein a plurality of exhaust air generating sources 36 such as boilers are disposed in a distributed manner, a plurality of tubular suction portions 2a are disposed such that a suction port 4a is opened to each exhaust air generating source 36 and all discharge ports 5a are combined into a single port so as to be connected to the upper exhaust tubular portion 3a a flow path of a fluid . is formed through each tubular suction portion 2a by the flow of a gaseous body which is supplied from the suction port 4a and discharged through the discharge port 5a where it intermingles before being discharged into atmosphere. Near the suction port 4a of each tubular suction portion 2a, there is disposed a delivery device 7a comprising a vaned wheel 8a whose blade portions project into the flow path 6a The vaned wheel 8a of the delivery device 7a is housed in a casing 9a of the same type as described above. A shaft 10a is pivotally supported by the casing 9a such that one end is coupled with the drive shaft of a motor lia, with a flywheel 12a fitted onto the other end.On the downstream side of the delivery device 7a, a first energy recovery device 13a of a type similar to the above described embodiment is disposed wherein the blade portion of a vaned wheel 14a projects into the flow path 6a.The vaned wheel 14a is housed in a casing integral with the tubular suction portion 2a. A shaft 16a is pivotally supported by the casing 15a and pneumatic tyre fitted flywheels 17a and 17a are mounted on both ends of the shaft 16a. Additionally, both flywheels 17a adjoin respective drive wheels 19a of dynamos 18a similarly to above described embodiment. Furthermore, on the upstream side of each first energy recovering device 13a, a second energy recovery device 20a similar to the above described device is disposed in such a manner that a vaned wheel 21a is housed in a casing 22a with its blade portion projecting into the flow path 6a.A shaft 23a .is pivotally supported by the casing 22a, and pneumatic tyre fitted flywheels 24a and 24a are mounted on both ends of the shaft 23a and respectively adjoin drive wheels 26a of the two dynamos 25a of the same type as described above . The dellvery devices 7a and the energy recovery devices 13a and 2Oa are arranged in the same manner as described above. Although the procedures for operating this exhaust device la and the actions of each individual element are the same as those of the first described embodiment,the plurality of exhaust air generating sources 36 need not all be operated at the same time, and it suffices to actuate one or two sources alone. The arrangement is such that electric power can also be shared among the exhaust air generating sources in correspondence with a state of, for example, exhausting air. In connection with the above embodiments, reference was made to an arrangement ,wherein a centrifugal type vaned wheel of a delivery section is driven by a motor, the vaned wheels of the recovery section whicH constituted by two or three Pelton wheel type stages driving respective dynamos, the flywheel of each recovery section onto which a pneumatic tyre is fitted being provided on both sides of each vaned wheel, and the electric power thus generated being supplied as an auxilary power source for the motor. However, the present invention not limited to this embodiment, and the size, number and material of the flywheel, the type, and number of stages of the, delivery and recovery sections, as well as the manner of using recovered energy, may be modified as required to the extent that the objects, actions and effects of the present invention described below are achievable.Also, while description was made of the case where this invention is embodied in a boiler, various applications are available such as one where it is vertically disposed on a given portion of a house or building for ventilation, dryout and so forth. It goes without saying that these modifications in no way change or alter the essence of this invention. As described above in detail, the flow path of the fluid in these embodiments, is formed through the tubular suction portion with the suction port at one end and the discharge port at the other end, of delivery sections being disposed such that their vaned wheels Prdject into the flow Dath, thereby absorbing the kinetic energy of the exhaust air so as to rotate the vaned wheels, and thus driving the dynamos by using the rotary motion of the vaned wheels and recovering the energy in the form of electric power for re use purposes.Therefore, it is a matter of course that, in addition to the efficient combustion of low quality fuel and reductions in fuel costs, running costs are also reduced and measures against air pollution can be enjoyed. The embodiments shown in Figs. 4 to 9 .arer examples of a liquid pumps which are equipped with energy recovery functions in the case of using a liquid such as water as the fluid. InFigs. 4 to 6, a liquid pump 40, based on a relatively simple structure wherein a liquid is drawn up from a single liquid tank by a manual pumping operation, is driven by means of a given energy source such as to enable the suction operation.A liquid storage chamber 41 in the shape of a box constituted by a bottom wall 42, a top wall 43 and a side wall is provided above a liquid F contained in a tank or the like.The top wall 43 is equipped with a pressure controlling member 44 for holding the space above the surface of the liquid at a fixed volume, and a suction pipe 45 having a given hollow shape extends from the bottom wall 42 to the liquid F. The upper end of the pipe 45 projects into the liquid storage chamber 41 and is formed with an inlet 46 which includes a first check valve 47 which opens in the inlet direction only. The lower end of the pipe 45 is formed with a suction port 48 which is disposed in the liquid F contained in the liquid tank. A plurality of support legs 49 are vertically installed within the liquid on the base of the tank. It is to be noted that the number and the shape of the support legs 49 are not limited to the particular structures illustrated and described herein. A suction unit 50 for drawing up the liquid F by means of the suction pipe 45 is disposed in the liquid storage chamber 41 such that it can be driven by a motor not shown . A delivery pipe 51 having a given hollow shape is jointed at one end to an outlet 52 formed in the side wall of the liquid storage chamber 41 perpendicular to the suction pipe 45. A second check valve 53 which opens unidirectionally toward the delivery side of the outlet 52, is disposed in said one end of the pipe 51. Additionally, as shown in the figures, the delivery pipe 51 is bent vertically downwards so as to be of an inverted L shape, the vertical leg of the delivery pipe 51 being disposed perpendicularly relative to the surface of the liquid F, with the lower end thereof having a discharge opening 54. A flow patty 55 of tne fluid flowing out of the liquid storage chamber 41 is thus formed through the delivery pipe 51. A vaned wheel 56 is disposed at a desired position in the vertically extending portion of the delivery pipe 51, the vaned wheel 56 being housed in a casing whose periphery is integral with the delivery pipe 51 in such a manner that a plurality of liquid receiving members 57, pivotally supported by the casing portion on a shaft 58, project into the flow path 55 of the liquid in the delivery pipe 51. The ends of the shaft 58 are provided with respective flywheels 58 whose outer peripheries are fitted with pneumatic tyres. The flywheels are mounted on opposite sides of the delivery pipe 51 such as to be rotatable with the vaned wheel 56. The peripheries of the flywheels 59 engage respective drive wheels 61 secured to the shafts of dynamos 60 installed on a base, whereby each of the dynamos 60 is rotated by means of the respective drive wheel 61 which is itself driven by a flywheel 59 rotating with the associated vaned wheel 56. Electricity can thereby be produced. Furthermore, on the downstream side of the delivery pipe 51 from the vaned wheel 56, a similar vaned wheel 62 is housed in the casing integral with the delivery pipe 51 such that a plurality of liquid receiver members 63 thereof project into the flow passage 55. The vaned wheels 62 and 56 are disposed at symmetrically opposed positions on each side of the delivery pipe at desired intervals along the same. A shaft 64 of the vaned wheel 62 is pivotally supported by the casing such that the vaned wheel 62 is freely rotated. Flywheels 65 having pneumatic tyres fitted onto their peripheries are mounted on both ends of the shaft 64 such as to be positioned on both sides of the delivery pipe 51.The peripheries of the flywheels 65 respectively engage drive wheels 67 of two dynamos 66 installed on the base such as to enable the dynamo 66 to produce electricity in the same manner as above in the case of the dynamos 60. In operating the liquid pump 40 having the above described construction, the suction pipe 45 is installed vertically in the liquid by means of the support legs 49 located on the lower end of the pipe 45, such that the suction port 48 is disposed in the liquid F. By operating a pumn of the suction unit 50, the liquid F is drawn up into a liquid storage tank 41 after pushing open the first check valve 47. The liquid which is stored in the chamber 41 pushes open the second check valve 53 and flows into the delivery pipe 51 by virtue of the potential energy which is obtained during the suction and the pumping action.The liquid falls at a gradually increasing speed while converting its potential energy to kinetic energy, and flows downward in the vertically extending portion of the delivery pipe 51, thereby forming the flow path 55 of the fluid. The liquid F which is falling downwards eventually strikes the liquid receiving member 57 of the vaned wheel 56 and rotates the vaned wheel 56 by transferring part of accumulated kinetic energy to same. As described above, since a pair of flywheels 59 are secured to the vaned wheel 56 and the dynamos 60 rotatably adjoin the flywheels 59 by way of the drive wheels 61, electric power can be produced by the rotation of the vaned wheels 56. Furthermore, although the liquid F gives part of its kinetic energy to the vaned wheel 56 and the speed of its downward flow temporarily slows down, the speed gradually increases again while the liquid continues to flow downward and thereby restores kinetic energy. In this state, the fluid F strikes the liquid receiving member 63 of the vaned wheel 62 disposed at the downstream end of the flow path 55, and, in a similar manner to that described above, give part of its kinetic energy to the vaned wheel 62, whereby the dynamo 66 is driven in a similar manner to the blade wheel 56, to generate electricity. It is to be noted that the arrangement of a given number of vaned wheels enables the amount of electricity produced to be increased as desired and the kinetic energy to be efficiently utilized before the fluid F flows into the liquid tank located below. Also, if this arrangement is carried out in one and the same tank, rotary flow can be obtained in series. A description will now be made of the embodiment shown in Fig. 7.

Additionally, each pair of flywheels not shown is secured to the shafts 58a and 64a of the respective blade wheels 56a and 62a, and dynamos 60a and 66a are disposed such that they can adjoin the above noted flywheels to generate electricity.In addition to the features of the above described embodiments, since the amount of liquid stored is increased, electricity can be produced more stably. Description will be made below of another embodiment shown in Fig. 8. A liquid pump 40b having a relatively large diameter is constituted by a bottom panel 42b, a top panel 43b and a side wall in such a manner as to form a cylindrical shape. A liquid storage chamber 41b is provided with a suction unit 50b which a given energy source can drive such as to suck a given liquid. A given number of suction pipes 45b are disposed in such a manner that a portion of the upper end of each respective pipes 45b projects into the liquid storage chamber 41b through the bottom panel 42b and each upper end thereof is provided with an inlet 46b. Each inlet 46b has a first check valve 47b which can open in one direction only, that is, in a direction into the liquid storage chamber 41b. An outlet 48b is provided on the lower end of each spective pipe 45b.These suction pipes 45b are arranged around the periphery of the cylindrical shape of the liquid storage chamber 41b in such a manner as to project downwardly into a liquid F. Also, The top panel 43b is provided with a cap like pressure controlling member 44b which holds the liquid surface contained in the liquid storage tank 41b to a predetermined level in the same manner as in each of the embodiments described above. lower liquid storage chamber 75 is disposed on the downstream side of liquid flow from the chamber 41b and is constituted by a bottom panel 73, a top panel 74 and a cylindrical side wall having a smaller diameter than the liquid storage chamber 41b in such a manner as to form the cross sectional shape of a flat box. The top panel 74 is connection to the bottom panel 42b of the liquid storage chamber 41b by means of a liquid supply pipe 76, the lower end of the pipe 76 being provided with a second check valve which can open unidirectionally towards the interior of the lower liquid storage chamber 75. A number of delivery pipes 51b is project from the bottom wall 73 of the lower liquid storage chamber 75 toward the surface of the.liquid F. The lower end of each pipe 51b has.a discharge port 5mob. A respective flow path 55b is formed by the fluid which flows downwards through each pipe Slob. Each delivery pipe 51b is provided with a number of vaned wheels 56b and 62b which are housed in casings integral with each delivery pipe 51b and which are pivotally supported by shafts 58b and 64b the wheels.The liquid receiving members of the respective vaned wheels 56b and 62b project into the flow path 55b, A pair of flywheels 59b and 65b are, in the same manner as in the above described embotiments, secured to the shafts 58b and 64b of the vaned wheels 56b and 62b, and dynamos 60b and 66b rotatably adjoin these lywheels such that electricity can be produced. Thus, in addition to the features of the above embodiments, the amount of liquid stored can be increased, thereby enabling the production of a larger amount of electric power. Still another embodiment will now be described with reference to Fig. 9. A liquid pump 40c has a main liquid storage chamber and a lower liquid storage chamber which differ from those of the above described embodiment, particularly, in regard to external size. is is arranged in such a manner that a larger number af suction pipes or a multiplicity of delivery pipes having a given number of vaned wheels can be utilised. The liquid pump 40c has large overall diameter and is constituted by a bottom panel 42c, a top panel 43c and a side wall such as to form.in the shape of a flat cylinder. The liquid storage chamber 41c is equipped with a suction unit 50c similar to that of each above mentioned embodiment. A number of. suction pipes 45c are disposed such that each of the upper end portions thereof is project into the liquid storage chamber 41c through the bottom panel 42c and the other end extends into a liquid F. Each upper end is provided with an inlet 46c, wherein a first check valve 47c is mounted such that it can open only towards the liquid storage chamber 41cl and each lower end is provided with a suction port 48c. A pressure controlling member 44c is provided in the top panel 43c in the same manner as in the above described embodiment. On On the downstream side of the liquid storage chamber 42c, a lower liquid storage chamber 79 of a circular shape is disposed around the periphery of the chamber 41c and has a larger overall diameter than the latter. The chamber 79 is formed with the cross sectional, shape of a shallow funnel with vertical side walls 78 and, a bottom panel 77 which slopes toward its center. A.liquid supply pipe 80 protrudes from the bottom panel 42c of the liquid storage chamber 41c whereby liquid contained n the chamber 41c can be supplied through the pipe 80. It is to be noted that the top panel portion of the lower liquid storage chamber 79 is formed such as to have an opening, so that rainwater can be stored as an auxialiary function when being used outdoors. A number of delivery pipes Slc extend from the bottom panel 77 of the lower liquid storage chamber 79 in such a manner that a delivery port 54c faces the surface of the liquid F. A flow path 55c is formed by fluid flowing in each delivery pipe Slc in the same manner as in the above described embodiments and a number of vaned wheels 56c and 62c are disposed so that liquid receiving members thereof project into the flow path 55c. The shafts 58c and 64c of the vaned wheels 56c and 62c are pivotally supported by a casing integral with each delivery pipe 51c, the respective wheels 56c and 62c are mounted rotatably and in series at symmetrically opposed positions, and a pair of flywheels 59c and 65c are secured to the respective shafts 58c in the same manner as in the above described embodiments. Also, the flywheels 59c and 65c rotatably adjoin the drive wheels 61c and 67c of the dynamos 60c and 66c in such a manner that thei vaned wheels 56c and 62c cause the Q namos 60c and 66c to generate electricity. In accordance with this embodiment, in addition to the features of the embodiments described above, the amount of liquid stored can be further increased and, since a considerable number of the delivery pipes 51 extend vertically fron the circular lower liquid storage chamber 79, thenumber of such delivery pipes Sic can be increased compared to other embodiments.Therefore, a large number of vaned wheels, and dynamos can be provided so as to allow an increase in the amount of energy generated. It is to be noted that a desired number of suction pipes, delivery pipes, suction units, flywheels, dynamos and vaned wheels can be provided and the location of each component can be modified as desired. In accordance with this latter embodiment described above in the liquid pump which is arranged in such a manner that a liquid is sucked by the suction unit driven by a given energy source and then transferred to another desired location, the liquid flowing downwards through the delivery pipes rotates a given number of vaned wheels which are rotatably projected into the delivery pipes to generate electricity, thereby, in the form of electric power, recovering part of the kinetic energy held by the downward flow of the liquid which has conventionally been wastefully discharged.Embodiments of the present invention range from a small sized type, such as a fish breeding tank and a water transfer pump which also serves as a purifier, to a large sized type, such as a water tank for irrigation purposes, so that, although any single amount of kinetic energy recovery may only be slight, if the apparatus of this invention were installed all over the world, a huge amount of energy could be recovered. Hence, it goes without saying that this invention is of considerable practical use in spite of its relatively simple structure, Description will be made below of embodiments employing a cylindrical liquid storage tank with reference to Figs. 10 to 12. In Fig. 10, a generator apparatus 85 employing a flow of liquid has a vertical shaft 86 which is pivoted on a bearing not shown . The. upper end of the shaft 86a is provided with a flywheel 87, the middle portion with a power transmission member 88 and the lower end with a Pelton type vaned wheel 89 in such a manner that all these components can be integrally rotated horizontally about the axis of the vertical shaft 86. A pnuematic tyre 90 is fitted onto the periphery of the above mentioned flywheel 87 and is adapted to smoothly rotate four dynamos 91 with a drive wheel which can rotatably adjoin the tyre 90 due to the elasticity of the same tyre. The power transmission member 88 is meshes with a motor 92 by means of a drive gear 93, and is connected to each dynamo 91 by means of conductors not shown or a switch, or alternatively, to another power supply. The vaned wheel 89 is located in a liquid F supplied to a liquid storage tank 94 which is formed in the shape of an upright cylinder having a bottom wall i.e. closed at its lower side , and its shape and size are suitably designed such as to interact with the liquid F. The vertical shaft 86 is perpendicularly inserted into the static surface of the liquid F in such a manner that the shaft 86, that is, the axis of rotation, is accurately directed toward the central point of the liquid storage tank 94. In addition to the above arrangement, the liquid storage tank 94 has a supply pipe 95 and a drainage pipe 96 which replace part of the liquid F with an amount of the liquid F containing high potential energy when the rotational speed of the liquid F slows down. The pipes 95 and 96 are passed into a cylindrical external wall 97 of the liquid storage tank 94 on lines tangential to the rotational direction.A tap 98 is mounted on the drainage pipe 96. Referring to the operation of the generator apparatus 85 described above, the motor 92 is started by closing a power supply circuit of the motor 92, thus allowing the fluid F to flow into the liquid storage tank through the supply pipe 95. Therefore, after the start up of the motor 92, liquid F is stored in the liquid storage tank 94 and is then rotated therein, so that a required amount of energy can be advantageously reduced. When the required amount of the fluid F has been supplied, the amount of the liquid equal to the supply is fed to a generator apparatus of a. lower stage by opening the tap 98 of the drainage pipe 96, or alternatively a tap not shown of the supply pipe 95 is closed. After the speed of the rotary flow of the liquid F reaches a sufficient level, the power supply of the motor is turned off, and it suffices to recover the electric power generated by the dynamos 91. Also, when the tap of the supply pipe 95 is closed, if the speed of the rotary flow slows down, the motor 92 is actuated such as to give energy to the liquid F. Through the above process, the liquid F is turned by the rotation of the vaned wheel 89, thereby forming the flow Xpath of a fluid which is in a rotary state in the liquid storage tank 94. DEscription will be made below of an example of afficisntly operating a plurality of the generator apparatuses shown in Fig. 10. Bereinafter, reference numeral 85A denotes a generator apparatus located on the upstream side, reference numeral 85boa generator apparatus located on the downstream side, with symbol a added to the end of each reference numeral of components constituting the circuiitry of the former apparatus and symbol b added to that of components constituting the latter circuitry . A liquid tank 100 is disposed in the highest position and a liquid delivery port 101 is formed near the bottom of one side wall of the liquid tank 100. A supply pipe 95a of the generator apparatus 85A is connected to the port 101 and a tap 102 or the like is mounted near the liquid delivery port 101.In addition, another liquid delivery port 103 is formed near the port 101 and is connected to a supply pipe 95b of the generator apparatus 85B. The supply pipe 95b meets a drainage pipe 96a of the generator apparatus 85A just in front of an opening of a liquid storage tank 94 of the generator apparatus 85B. On the further upstream side of the point where the two pipes meet, there is disposed a tap 104b which opens and closes by receiving electric signals. Since each generator apparatus 85A and 84B requires a head in relation to the liquid tank 100, the supply pipes 95a and 95b are both bent suitably downward.Furthermore, the generator apparatus 85B is disposed in the lowest position in such a manner that it has the head in relation to the drainage pipe 96a of the generator apparatus 85A. A drainage pipe 96b of the generator apparatus 85B is connected to a reflux port 105 which is formed at an upper portion of the side wall of the liquid tank 100. The delivery pipe 96b is also provided with a tap 106b and a reflux pump 107. Conductors C1 and C2 interconnect a motor 92a, dynamos 91a of the generator apparatus 85A, a motor 92b, dynamos 91b of the generator apparatus 85B, a power supply 108 and the reflux pump 107. Additionally, any one of the dynamos 91b is connected to a sensor 109b which detects an increase and decrease in the electric power generated by the generator apparatus, and the sensor 109b is further connected to the tap 104b which opens and closes by receiving the electric signals. Referring to the operation of the apparatus described above, motors 92a and 92b are first started by closing circuit stc llOa and llOb. Secondly, the taps 102a and 104b are opened to pass the liquid F into the liquid storage tanks 94a and 94b. In this cmditim, the tap 104b is naturally in the open state since it is adapted automatically toopenin the amount of power generated is small. When a required amount of the liquid F is supplied to both liquid storage tanks 94a and 94b , the tap 102a is closed to some extent with a tap llla in the drainage pipe 96a and a tap 106b in the drainage pipe 96b slightly opened such that the constant replacement of the liquid F is performed little by little.Also, when the generated power reaches a desired level, circuit switches llOa and llOb are opened to stop the motors 92a and 92b. Through the above described operation, a flow path is formed by the rotary flow of the liquid F in each liquid storage tank 94a and 9b thereby allowing the vaned wheels 89a to continue to rotate. This rotary motion is trans ,itted through fly r e is 87a , 87b and each drive wheel, and then drives the dynamos 91a and 91b which are supported by a separate machine frame. The dynamos continue to substantially stably generate electricity, and the electric power thus generated is recovered into the power supply 108 and so forth. It is to be noted that the rate of power consumption is relatively small since the reflux pump 107 has only to feed back the liquid F to the liquid tank 100 by intermittently actuating the circuit switch 112 when the drainage pipe 96b is filled with the fluid F. Another embodiment will now be described with reference to Fig. 12. A hermetically sealed lid 113 covers the upper opening of the liquid storage tank 94 of the generator apparatus 85 referred to in the description of the above embodiment and an exhaust port not shown is formed such as to constitute a liquid storage chamber 114. After a suitable amount of the liquid F has been fed into the liquid storage chamber 114, the supply pipe 95 and the drainage pipe 96 are respectively closed, and the air remaining over the surface of the liquid F is removed through the exhaust port not shown such as to form a vacuum.This process prevents the residual air from interfering with the wave motion produced in a flow path 99 during the rotary motion of the liquid F as well as improving the inertia of the rotary motion of the saQ8S881 It is to be noted that this method is also suitable for the case where only a little amount of the liquid F is supplied through the supply pipe 95 or valuable liquids other than water are used as the liquid F. Reference will i be mob to yet another embodiment wherein the entirety of the generator apparatus 85 can be hermetically housed in a vacuum chamber 115 which is constituted by a base portion 116 which is one size larger than the liquid storage chamber 114 in diameter, and a cylindrical cover member in the form slid 117 ch is detachably fitted over the bottom portion 116, thereby hermetically sealing the inside of the vacuum chamber 115. The generator apparatus 85 is laid on the base 116 over which the cover member 117 is fitted and the air inside the vacuum chamber 115 is removed through an exhaust port 118.Since this embodiment is operated in a state wherein a supply flow can be fed into the liquid storage chamber 114 through the supply pipe 95 under the evacuated condition, the flywheel 87 rotates in the evacuated space and the rotary flow of the liquid F along the flow path 99 is efficiently maintained due to the effect of the flow supplied through the supply pipe 95, whereby the efficiency of power generation is advantageously improved. Furthermore, this preferred embodiment is adapatable for another embodiment without any modification. For example, the liquid storage chamber 114 and the vacuum chamber 115 are arranged such as to be evacuated, whereby the mothod of this embodiment is made capable of being adapted to a situation where water supply is scarce or where a valuable liquid other than water is used. In the latter embodiment, a given power source is used as a motor and four dynamos in the form of a bicycle s headlight dynamo are used with a number of flywheels each having the shape of a bicycle tyre. However, this invention is of course not limited to this embodiment. As described above in detail, in the latter erts, the vaned wheels which are rotatably mounted along the vertical shaft are rotated by means of the power transmission member which is driven by a given power source in a given liquid supplied into the liquid storage tank having a given shape of a cylinder with the bottom, thereby allowing the liquid to form a flow path. After the power source has been turned off, the rotation of the vaned wheel is maintained by the fluid which continues to rotate,as well as the inertia of a number of vaned wheels and flywheels which are disposed in the flow pA th, whereby electric power is produced by the dynamos which are tuned by the flywheels whose peripheries adjoin the dynamos.Therefore, as compared with conventional hydroelectric power generating systems, the kinetic energy which a liquid holds within itself is capable of being efficiently utilized, and further, since the liquid is rotated in the liquid storage chamber or the apparatus which is housed in the evacuated chamber is operated in the vacuum crnditims, the kinetic energy of inertia is capable of being further efficiently utilized. In addition, since the same liquid can be used repeatedly, a high mass, low viscosity liquid other than water may be used. The satisfactory production of electricity can also be performed by using a trickiing stream of ordinary water, so that the small sized embodiment of this invention may easily be instaled at a site where the quantity of running water is small, for example, locations such as a valley near the source of a river which have conventionally been unused owing to the fact that the undertakingofshworksasthebildigof a dam has been difficult to accomplish in such places. If several tens or hundreds of generators in accordance with this invention are installed in series down the length of a valley of this type, the production of electricity is enabled on a commerciallly viable basis.Thus, it goes without saying that this apparatus is a most eagerly awaited invention at the present times when difficulties in the location of hydroelectric, thermal and atomic power plants as well as exhaustion of fuel resources are expected in the near future. It is to be noted that as the flywheels used for this invention, a plurality of individual units may be disposed in the cylindrical form as described above, for example, or alternatively, as shown in Fig. 13, a group of a given plurality of flywheels may be arranged about a single shaft of a vaned wheel. Description will be made below of the latter embodiment with reference to Fig. 13. A group of flywheels A hereinafter merely referred to as flywheel s is housed in a housing portion 201 which is constituted by a base 211 having a disc shape and a dome shaped cover member 212 which can be fitted over the base 211 to provide a sealed condition.A vaned wheel shaft 202 for example, reference numeral 30 in Fig. 1 is pivotally supported by a suspended frame not shown in the center of the housing portion 201 and is vertically connected to a rotary shaft221. The lower end portion of the rotary shaft 221 is pivotally mounted on a drive member 203 having a column shape and four intermediate flywheels 204,which are pivoted on shafts 242,are disposed such that they adjoin the periphery of the drive member 203.A single flywheel 205 engages the periphery of each intermediate flywheel 204, three dynamos 206 also engage the periphery of each flywheel 205, and thereby, each dynamo 206 can be rotated to produce electricity. A pneumatic tyre 241 is fitted over the periphery of each intermediate flywheel 204 such that they can be driven without any slippage. Each flywheel 204 with its pneumatic tyre 241 is vertically installed on the base 211 by means of the shafts 242 which are pivoted on bearing means in such a manner that each tyre is maintained in engagement with the cive member 203. Also, a pneumatic tyre 251 is fitted over the periphery of each flywheel 205 which is vertically installed on the base 211 by means of shafts 252 which rotatably adjoin the periphery of the intermediate flywheel 204 and are pivoted on bearing means. Furthermore, each dynamo 206 is vertically installed on the base 211 such that it can be driven by a drive ring 261 adjoining the periphery of each flywheel 205 and the electric power thus generated can be transmitted to a desired location by way of conductor wires not shown . As described above, the general construction of this embodiment is such that the group of flywheels A is formed in the housing portion 201 constituted by the cover member 212 which is fitted over the base 211. Referring to the operation of the group of flywheels A, the vaned wheel shaft 202 is started by supplying electric power, aDd then, the rotation of the shaft 202 is transmitted from the rotary shaft 221 to each flywheel 205 via the drive member 203 and each intermediate flywheel 204. Consequently each flywheel 205 is rotated to turn a total of twelve dynamos 206, so that a time delay occurs in the time when the electric power thus generated reaches a rated value.However, once it reaches the rated value, a huge amount of kinetic energy which a total of eight flywheels have accummulated is balanced with the electric power generated by twelve dynamos 206, whereby even when variations occur in the voltage amount and the frequency of the electric power supplied to the vaned wheel shaft 202 that is, a motor , the power generated by the group of flywheels A does not substantially vary.
