# Reproduction camera.

## Abstract
A reproduction camera suitable for at least a main expos ure and a non imagewise additional exposure through a con tact screen, is provided with a sensor which measures the light reflected by the original and which on the basis of this measurement corrects the additional exposure via a compu ter. In this way the correction for the stray light, produced at the lens of the camera, is achieved, to get the right exposure times.
