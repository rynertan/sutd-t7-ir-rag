## Description
SHAMPOO COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to aqueous cleansing compositions having at least two distinct water miscible liquid phases. Multiphase liquid cleansing compositions containing water for bath or shower use and for cleansing hair have been proposed. Some of the prior art compositions have relied upon the inclusion of a hydrocarbon oil or similar oily component which is substantially immiscible with water and consequently forms a separate layer after a simple mixture thereof with water has been allowed to stand undisturbed. In other prior art compositions, for example those disclosed in British specification NO 1247189, substantial concentrations of hydroxylic solvents such as the lower aliphatic alcohol 5 have been included. Whilst such hydroxylic compounds are themselves miscible with water in more or less all proportions, in the presence of aqueous surfactants solutions containing water soluble inorganic salts a salting out effect occurs which results in a multiphase composition from which two distinct liquid layers separate when a previously shaken mixture is allowed to stand undisturbed. Three phase liquid mixtures which are a combination of the above that is having two aqueous phases achieved by salting out with a supernatant oil layer have been proposed. Furthermore, three phase liquid mixtures have also been prepared by admixing a single aqueous phase with hydrocarbon oils and certain silicones which latter are immiscible both with hydrocarbon oils and water. The first mentioned group of prior art compositions suffers from the disadvantages firstly that both phases are not miscible with water in all proportions secondly, an excess of oil in a shampoo can be undesirable especially for people with naturally oil rich heads of hair further, oil tends to be deposited on the hair leading to unsightly, greasy hair that is unattractive even on hair that Is naturally not oil rich. Even for those having relatively d ry hair the path to improved manageability is not necessarily via the mere addition of oils to the hair. The second mentioned group of prior art compositions in which both phases are miscible with water in substantially all proportions, suffer from the disadvantages firstly, of the undesirable smell of alcohol that needs to be masked and which can lead to unwarranted formula modifications detrimental to performance secondly, the inclusion of much alcohol tends to have a denaturing effect, even on naturally greasy hair, by stripping of the natural oils from the hair shaft. It will be appreciated that for those with naturally dryN hair such stripping of meagre natural oils is highly undesirable thirdly, such alcohol rich compositions tend to have low viscosities, leading to inconvenience in use. The third mentioned group of prior art compositions suffers from the disadvantages to be expected from a combination of the two types of composition. Moreover to add a further water immiscible material does not mitigate the ill effects of an oily composition. In our copending British Patent Application No. 8402686, we have proposed to mitigate the abovementioned disadvantages by combining aqueous surfactants having a high foaming potential with an aqueous solution of sodium hexametaphosphate to produce a two layer composition in which both layers are miscible with water in all proportions. An effective two layer shampoo composition, for use inter alia on the hair, is thus achieved without recourse to the use of oils or hydroxylic solvents. It has to be observed that minimal amounts of lower aliphatic alcohols, significantly below 2 w w of the total composition are admitted in the compositions the subject of the abovementioned British Patent Application, for example to assist the solubilisation of cosmetic components such as perfumes and other additaments of an oily nature. U.S. A 3313735 discloses the use of 0.2 5 of phosphono compounds, in particular alkylphosphono acetic acids in conjunction with 10 30 of certain non soap anionic surfactants which are all dissolved in water to form a clear homogeneous solution which is useful as a hair conditioning shampoo. The specification does not disclose multiphase compositions. It is known that the condensed phosphates, such as sodium hexametaphosphate, undergo slow hydrolysis in an aqueous medium. Such hydrolysis can, in some cases, lead to unsightly products which may not be attractive to the ultimate user of a shampoo composition notwithstanding that its efficacy as a shampoo is thereby unimpaired. Since elevated temperatures such as may be encountered for example during storage, increase the rate of hydrolysis, the defect described is considered undesirable in a cosmetic preparation. We have now found that liquid multiphase cleansing compositions, the separate liquid phases of which are miscible with water, and which are satisfactory for bath or shower use and as hair shampoos may be prepared without recourse to the use of the abovementioned oils, hydroxylic solvents or sodium hexametaphosphate. Accordingly the present invention provides liquid cleansing compositions comprising water at least one surfactant and at least one sequestering agent, the relative concentrations of the components being so chosen that the composition has at least two distinct layers which are temporarily interdispersible upon agitation and wherein each layer Is miscible with water in substantially all proportions. The concentration of surfactant is preferably up to 50 by weight of the total composition. The concentration of sequestering agent is preferably up to 30 by weight of the total composition. Preferably the surfactant comprises at least one anionic, amphoteric or non Ionic surfactant or a mixture thereof. More preferably the surfactant comprises at least one anionic surfactant and at least one surfactant other than an anionic surfactant. The anionic surfactant is preferably a blend of anionic surface active agents. Generally, the anionic surfactant or blend thereof will be chosen so as to yield a highly foamant composition be it for bath shower use or as a hair shampoo. Whether a single anionic or a blend thereof is used, it is so chosen that it has a gentle action on the hair when the composition according to the invention is to be used as a hair shampoo. Furthermore, for use as hair shampoos those surfactants known to have condition enhancing effects in use on the hair will be chosen. Individual surfactants include soaps, for example sodium laureth 13 carboxylate and sodium trideceth 7 carboxylate, water soluble salts of organic sulphuric reaction products having in their molecular structure an alkyl or alkylene group containing from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms and a radical selected from the group consisting of sul phonic acid and sulphuric acid ester groups. Important examples of this group of anionic surfactants are sodium and potassium alkyl sulphates in which the alkyl group is similar to or the same as may be found in tallow or coconut oil reduction products sodium or potassium alkyl benzene sulphonates which contain alkyl groups with about 9 to about 15 carbon atoms as well as the ethoxylated derivatives of the above materials having up to about 10 moles of ethylene oxide per molecule sodium alkylglycerylether sulphonates in which the alkyl groups are as obtained from alcohols derived from tallow or coconut oil and acyl sarcosinates including about 10 to about 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain. Preferred surfactants are mono , di and tri ethanol amine and sodium salts of alkyl sulphate in which the alkyl chain contains about 12 carbon atoms, sodium and triethanol amine salts of the sulphate or sulphonated condensation product of 1 mole coconut fatty alcohol with up to 3 moles ethylene oxide. Other anionic surfactants that may be employed include sulphosuccinates, such as sodium pareth 25 sulphosuccinate. It will be appreciated by those versed in the art that with some compositions the anionic surfactant may be replaced at least in part by an amphoteric surfactant.Suitable examples of such are certain glycinates such as cocoamphocarboxyglycinate, cocoamphoglyci nate, AMPHOLAK XCG 3 Trade Mark ex AMPHOTERICS INTERNATIONAL, which ts a blend of cocoamphocarboxyglycinate and a complex N cocoamine carboxylic acid of relatively low molecular weight between 400 and 800, in the ratio 85 15 by weight and TEA PEG 3 cocoamide sulphate. The surfactant other than the anionic surfactant, herein referred to as the other surfactant, preferably includes a nonionic surfactant or an amphoteric surfactant or a blend thereof, that is mixtures of nonionic surfactants and mixtures of amphoteric surfactants. Furthermore blends of nonionic surfactants with amphoteric surfactants may be employed to advantage. Similarly, certain cationic surfactants may be included in some blends. Typically, the following surfactants fall into this category, cocoamide DEA, PEG 6 cocoamide, oleamide DEA, linoleamide DEA, lauramide MIPA, PEG 120 methyl glucose dioleate, polyoxyethylene propylene glycol dioleate, PEG 20 glyceryl laurate, PEG 20 glyceryl stearate, PEG 2O glyceryl oleate, polyethylene glycol distearates of molecular weight from about 1000 to about 10000 also similar phosphate esters including PPG 5 ceteth 10 phosphate, trilaureth 4 phosphate betaines, such as cocoamidopropyl betaine, lauryl betaine cocoamidopropyl dimethylamine betaine amine oxides such as stearamine oxide, cocoamidopropylamine oxide, N myristyldimethylamine oxide, PEG lauramine oxide, dihydroxyethyltallowamine oxide some sultaines such as cocoamidopropyl hydroxysultaine some cationic surfactants such as quaternium 70, guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, polyquaternium 4. The sequestering agents used in the compositions of the present invention may be in the form of free acids or normal salts thereof. Preferably the sequestering agent is present in the form of a normal salt, that is to say a salt in which any free acid groups are electrically neutral ised by a suitable alkali metal ion or a suitable organic base.A blend of sequestering agents may also be employed. Preferably the sequestering agent provides a completing anion which is strong enough for a 0.01M solution thereof to be in equilibrium with less than 10 3 mole of calcium ion. Preferably, the materials used in compositions of the present invention and referred to herein as the sequestering agent fall into one of the following categories of compounds organophosphonic acids and their salts aminocarboxylic acids and their salts and mixtures thereof, and optionally including polyhydroxycarboxylic acids and their salts and or inorganic salts such as sodium sesquicarbonate. The sequestering agents have in common the feature of chemical stability to hydrolysis under the conditions expected to be encountered by a cleansing composition, which distinguishes them as a group from sodium hexametaphosphate.Moreover it has been found that the sequestering agents when included in the compositions of the present invention for washing hair exhibit good hair conditioning properties, that is they at least contribute to the post shampooing manageability, feel and appearance of the hair. Accordingly, in a particular aspect the present invention provides a liquid hair shampoo composition comprising water at least one anionic surfactant at least one surfactant other than an anionic surfactant and at least one sequestering agent selected from i organophosphonates of general formula I R1 N R 2 I wherein R CH2P03M2, M represents hydrogen, or a cosmetically acceptable organic and or inorganic base andR1 is a straight or branched chain alkyl group which may contain an odd or even number of carbon atoms up to 14 in number, a hydroxyalkyl group containing from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, or a groupEMI8.1 in which n 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 or R1 R or ii aminocarboxylic acids of general formula II EMI8.2 wherein R2 H CH2CH20H or CH2COOM R3 CH2CH20H, CH2COOM orEMI9.1 R4 COOM orEMI9.2 where M is as defined above or mixtures thereof optionally containing iii polyhydroxycarboxylic acids containing 5 to 7 carbon atoms, optionally in a ring, and more than two hydroxyl groups per molecule or their salts with cosmetically acceptable organic and or inorganic bases and or iv sodium sesquicarbonate, the relative concentrations of the components being so chosen that the composition has at least two distinct layers which are temporarily interdispersible upon agitation and wherein each layer is miscible with water in substantially all proportions. The compositions of the present invention will usually have 2 distinct layers, however the invention encompasses the possibility of having 3 or even 4 layers each of which is miscible with water in substantially all proportions. The separate layers in the compositions of the present invention are preferably clear and bright. In a composition having only two layers, an upper layer, largely containing dissolved surfactant and a lower layer largely containing dissolved sequestering agent it is especially preferable to achieve clear, bright phases. The clarity of the layers depends in part on the nature of the components, their purity and concentration. The relative proportions of the selected components in the composition are determined by the overriding requirement for a multiphase composition. Broadly, the maximum concentration of sequestering agent will be 25 by weight of the composition. The maximum total surfactant concentration will be 40 by weight of the composition. The maximum concentration of anionic surfactant will be 25 by weight of the composition. Preferred ranges of concentrations based by weight of the final composition are 5 to 15 anionic surfactant or blend thereof, up to 15 of other surfactant or blend thereof, up to 15 of sequestering agent and more than 60 of water. More preferably the concentration of sequestering agent is from 2 15 . The amount of sequestering agent is generally towards the low end of this range. The proportion of water is preferably below 85 . Liquid shampoos generally contain more than about 60 of water. Below that value they tend to be of a pasty consistency. At a concentration greater than 85 by weight of water, the amount of active material per unit dose may sometimes be insufficient. However, liquid shampoos with over 90 water occur in the market place at a price attractive to some consumers. It therefore has to be observed that some of the compositions of the present invention can still retain their multi phase state at such dilutions. The compositions of the present invention are extremely complex because the materials used are generally industrial products which rarely contain a single substance.Nevertheless it has been found that an informative curve results from plotting relative concentrations in water of the three main components anionic surfactant, other surfactant and sequestering agent. By plotting such curves at given concentrations of water in the composition a good idea of the three dimensional phase diagram at a given temperature may be had. The invention is further illustrated in the accompanying drawings, where concentrations are expressed as ratios from which absolute concentrations in terms of percentage by weight of the total composition may be determined in conjunction with the indicated water content which is fixed for each phase diagram, in which Figure 1 is a plot on triangular coordinates of compositions which contain 60 water with various concentrations of triethanol amine lauryl sulphate as anionic surfactant, coconut diethanolamide as nonionic surfactant and the sodium salt of nitrilo tris methylene phosphonic acid as sequestering agent.The right upright side of the triangle represents increasing concentration of nonionic surfactant with maximum coconut diethanolamide at the apex of the triangle the left upright side of the triangle represents increasing concentration of anionic surfactant with maximum triethanol amine lauryl sulphate at the left extremity of the base the base of the triangle represents increasing concentration of sequestering agent with maximum sodium nitrilo tris methylene phosphonate at the right those compositions exhibiting a multiplicity of phases lie to the right of the boundary curve Figure 2 is a similar plot for a concentration 70 of water Figure 3 is a similar plot for a concentration 80X of water and Figure 4 is a similar plot for a concentration 90 of water Since, nominally, water represents an upright edge of a tetrahedron resting on its base, the size of these phase diagrams diminishes as the concentration of water increases. It can be visualised from this collection of phase diagrams that the shape of the whole boundary surface is reminiscent of a partly filled sail. Figures 5, 6 and 7 are plots of different mixtures of as anionic surfactant, sodium laureth sulphate sodium 2 mole ethoxylated lauryl sulphate as other surfactant the nonionic surfactant cocoamide DEA coconut diethanolamide and as sequestering agent trisodium HEDTA the trisodium salt of N hydroxyethyl ethylenediamine triacetic acid respectively at 72 , 80X and 90 water contents. A similarly shaped boundary surface is apparent from this collection of phase diagrams. Multiphase compositions lie to the right of the boundary curves and single phase compositions to the left thereof. It will be appreciated that the compositions within the invention referred to above as falling within the boundary curves consi st of the main components of the present invention and do not include the additaments characteristic of commercial preparations. With increase in temperature it has been found that the phase volume ratio for a given two phase composition is reduced, that is the upper layer effectively tends to diminish. Generally the multiphase compositions of the present invention when subjected to cyclic temperature changes, that is increase in temperature followed by decrease in temperature or vice versa, undergo reversible changes in phase volume ratio. Various materials may be added to the surfactant blends as viscosity modifiers and or clarifying agents etc.Minimal amounts of lower aliphatic alcohols, significantly below 2 by weight of the total composition are admissable in the compositions of the present invention, for example to assist in the dispersion of cosmetic components such as perfumes and other additaments of an oily nature. The various materials include conventional thickeners such as the cellulose derivatives, for example hydroxyethyl cellulose, ethylhydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose natural gums such as xanthan gum synthetic materials such as the polyalkylene glycol block polymers and copolymers exemplified by polyethylene glycols block polymers of mean molecular weight 200 to 35000, polypropylene glycol block polymers of mean molecular weight 200 to 35000 and mixed polyethylene polypropylene glycol block copolymers of mean molecular weight less than 10,000 mildly anionic polymeric materials such as the sodium salt of acrylic acid copolymers higher fatty alcohols such as lauryl alcohol, cetyl alcohol and the like as well as salts such as magnesium aluminium silicate, sodium and or potassium citrates, sodium chloride or mixtures thereof. A buffer may be included in the compositions of the invention to achieve a desired pH value in the final composition. Generally the pH of the compositions lies in the range 4.5 to 10 preferably 6 to 8. It has to be observed that the phase volume ratio can vary with pH insofar as it is necessary to include a buffer to arrive at an acceptable final pH value and such inclusion changes the composition hence its location on a phase diagram. The compositions of the present invention are nominally liquid cleaners. Users are accustomed to a degree of thickness or body in such compositions for use in the shower, the bath or as hair shampoos. Such thickness at least in part is reflected in the viscosity of a composition. The viscosity of the composition of the invention containing the main components but without customary additives varied considerably from composition to composition depending on the precise components used, some may require thickening and some may require thinning. The range of viscosity of compositions of the present invention is up to 3000 centipoise as determined using aBrookfield viscometer model RVT using spindle No. 3 at speed 20 at 200C. Preferably, the viscosity range is 400 1500 centi poise. The compositions of the present invention may include the customary cosmetic additaments , for example colourants which usually affect the layers differently perfumes pacifying agents and pearl esci ng agents such as ethylene glycol monostearate lanolin and its derivatives, preservatives, protein and hydrolysates thereof antidandruff agents, such as coal tar solution and piroctone olamine for example OCTOPIROX, Trade Mark ofHoechst GmbH for the monoethanolamine salt of 1 hydroxy 4 methyl 6 2,4,4 trimethyl pentyl 2 1H pyridi none . It is worth remembering that the inclusion of these additaments affects the constitution of the composition of main components and hence its position on the phase diagrams, so some care has to be exercised to attain a given ratio of upper to lower layers. In the following Examples illustrating the invention percentages are by weight of the total final composition except where otherwise indicated. Throughout, the phase volume ratios expressed are as upper lower layers. The method of preparing the compositions was the same throughout involving mixing together the surfactant materials, water and colourants with stirring whilst gently heating until a homogeneous mixture is formed. The sequestering agent was then added with gentle heating if necessary and the whole was allowed to cool. Finally perfume was added and the pH was adjusted with citric acid as necessary.
