## Description
The present invention relates to an antenna apparatus including an improved frequency separator using frequency selective reflecting surfaces FSRSs . In satellite communication, an increase in the communication capacity commonly requires the use of a single reflector by two or more frequencies. In order that a common reflector can be used by a plurality of frequencies, beams of different frequencies transmitted from a plurality of electromagnetic horns to the reflector have to be composed, or beams of different frequencies reflected from the reflector to the plurality of electromagnetic horns have to be separated. It is known that this object can be achieved by arranging, in the path of electromagnetic waves propagating through free space, a frequency selective reflecting surface FSRS or surfaces having transmissive and reflective characteristics which depend on the frequency. As one of such FSRSs, there is known a metallic plate having square apertures periodically arranged in a lattice form. This lattice apparently serves as an inductance in a relatively low frequency region, and its transmission coefficient is in principle 1 at its resonance frequency. In a higher frequency region higher modes occur each having its own resonance frequency and a certain transmission coefficient smaller than 1. There is known a technique by which a plurality of such lattices are used in a lower frequency region, i.e. the region where the lattices act as inductances, in order to separate frequencies by utilizing the interaction resonance resulting from interactions between the lattices. This prior art, however, has the disadvantage that the curve of its resonance characteristic is steeply inclined which if a wide band pass characteristic is to be obtained, requires many lattices. This is un economical and furthermore increases transmission losses. To obviate this disadvantage, in JP A 137703 81, published after the priority dates claimed for the present application, the present inventors proposed a frequency separator whose pass band is set in a frequency region higher than the region where an FSRS having a lattice of square apertures is considered as an inductance but lower than the inherent resonance frequency of the lattice and in which a plurality of lattices are arranged at prescribed intervals. Lattices arranged in the pass band in this manner can be regarded as resonant elements of inductance capacitances LCs , and the resonance of each lattice coupled with that resulting from interactions between the lattices enabled a frequency separator having a wide band pass characteristic to be realized. This frequency separator proposed in JP A 137703 81, however, involves the problem that, because it uses a lattice of square apertures, incoming electromagnetic waves of the transverse electric TE mode and waves of the transverse magnetic TM mode will have different resonance frequencies, if those waves are obliquely incident on an FSRS. This results in the deterioration of its frequency characteristic and leads to a frequency characteristic widely different from that for normally incident waves. In connection with this problem, there is known a technique using a lattice with rectangular instead of square apertures. This is disclosed in, for example, A Quasi Optical Polarization Independent Diplexer for Use in the Beam Feed System of Millimeter Wave Antennas by A.A.M. Saleh et al.,published in the IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, Vol. AP 24, No. 6, November 1976, pp. 780 785. According to this article, the periodicity and size of apertures in the lattice are so determined that, the FSRS being regarded as an inductance, the inductance of the vertical strip of apertures and that of the horizontal strip are identical with respect to obliquely incident waves. In particular, this article relates to the theory and performance of a quasi optical Fabry Perot diplexer employing two rectangular meshes and capable of polarization independent operation at large angles of incidence. This disclosed diplexer is suitable for use in a dual polarization dual frequency beam feed system for millimeter wave antennas. By using rectangular cells of the mesh which dimensions are adapted to the incidence of angle of the electromagnetic wave a polarization independent operation has been achieved. Whereas the article mostly deals with inductive meshes, it is also mentioned that a capacitive mesh can be formed from a complementary structure. In another article Thin Film Optical Filter , by H.A. Macleod, A. Hilger Ltd., London, 1969, pages 309 312, dichroic beam splitters are described for splitting light into its primary colour components. This article deals with the problem how to use dichroic beam splitters at oblique angles. This problem primarily stems from the difference in behaviour of the dichroic beam splitters for the two principle planes of polarization. According to this article a circular polarizer is included in this system so that the mean of the characteristic is obtained and the bad influence of highly polarized light is limited. As another method this article suggests to use filters which are constructed from dielectric materials, whereby as far as possible more high index than low index material in the stack is used. Furthermore, the high index layers should be thicker than the low index layers. One object of the present invention, therefore, is to provide an antenna apparatus including a frequency separator without the performance deterioration resulting from the oblique incidence of electromagnetic waves on FSRSs where the FSRSs are regarded as the resonant elements of LCs. This object is achieved by the features of the claims. Other features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the detailed description hereunder taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. In the drawings, in which like reference numerals denote like structural elements Fig. 1 shows an offset type antenna apparatus in which a frequency selective reflecting surface FSRS 12 is used for transmitting and reflecting electromagnetic waves fed from two horns 13 and 14 in the same direction with a single reflector 11. The horn 13 transmits a signal whose frequency is within the pass band of the FSRS 12, through FSRS 12 to the reflector 11 which in turn reflects it into the intended direction D. Meanwhile, the horn 14 transmits a signal whose frequency is in the reflection band of the FSRS 12, to the FSRS 12 from which the signal is reflected to the reflector 11 from which it is then reflected and sent out in the direction D. Conversely, it is also possible to separate signals incident on the reflector 11 from the direction opposite to D and to receive them with the horns 13 and 14, and it is readily understood that both or either of the horns 13 and 14 can be used for receiving. A conventional FSRS illustrated in Fig. 2 consists of a metallic square apertured lattice 15. When an incident wave S One type of the conventional frequency separators uses the above mentioned relatively low frequency zone Z Furthermore, in a frequency separator structured as illustrated in Fig. 5A having square shaped lattice apertures, the TE incident wave and the TM incident wave will have different frequency characteristics if electromagnetic waves are obliquely incident on a FSRS, as stated above. This disadvantage can be obviated by using rectangular lattice apertures and adjusting their size and periodicity of arrangement in such a way that the inductances of the vertical and horizontal strips be identical with each other, as proposed in the above cited article by Saleh et al. On the other hand, the frequency separator designed by the present inventors to achieve a broader band pass characteristic has its pass band in the region where the FSRSs can be regarded as the resonant elements of LCs rather than inductances like in previous separators. In an FSRS designed in this way, the identity of the inductive components of the strips, such as proposed by Saleh et al as referred to above, by itself is inadequate for eliminating the disparity between the pass bands of the TE incident wave and the TM incident wave or preventing the occurrence of the dip in which a signal to be transmitted is blocked. Hereinafter will be explained the principle of a frequency separator whose pass band is set in the region where lattices can be regarded as LC resonant elements to constitute one feature of the present invention. It is first assumed that a square apertured lattice is a combination of vertical parallel strips and horizontal parallel strips. Or it is assumed that the parallel strips of Fig. 6A and those of Fig. 7A are put together to constitute the square apertured lattice shown in Fig. 2. When the plane of polarization E is parallel to parallel strips as in Fig. 6A, the equivalent circuit can be represented by an inductance L as in Fig. 6B. When the plane of polarization E is perpendicular to parallel strips as in Fig. 7A, the equivalent circuit can be represented by a capacitance C as in Fig. 7B. Therefore, the equivalent circuit of a square apertured lattice can be represented by an LC resonance circuit, though in the frequency region above its resonance frequency f₁ the equivalent circuit cannot be so simply represented because, as stated above, such a frequency region is of higher modes. The frequency characteristic of the lattice below the frequency f₁ in Fig. 4, is represented by an LC resonance circuit. In the lower frequency zone where the effect of said capacitance C is reduced, only the inductance L is relevant. The pass band of a frequency separator can be set in the region which can be regarded as the LC resonance zone of each of its lattices in the following manner. As illustrated in Fig. 8A, three lattices 17 are arranged parallel to each other at intervals of I₁ and I₂. The equivalent circuit of this arrangement can be represented by Fig. 8B. If the frequencies of inherent resonances of the lattices 17 are equally designed at f₁, the transmission of the separator arranged as in Fig. 8A will be 1 at frequency f₁. Further, to avert a region of higher modes, f₁ is set slightly above the upper limit of the pass band to be used. The Q factors of the L C resonance circuits being represented by Q₁, Q₂ and Q₃, two resonance points attributable to interactions between the lattices two for three lattices 17 can be created, as represented by 18 and 18 in FIG. 8C, in addition to the inherent resonance point f₁ if Q factors Q₁, Q₂ and Q₃ and the intervals l₁ and l₂ between the lattices are properly selected. In this case, the Q factor of each lattice and the intervals between the lattices should be so selected that the two additional resonance points may not enter the region of higher modes but can be realized in lower frequencies than f₁ and yet can cover the pass band. In this manner the characteristic illustrated in FIG. 8C is achieved. The Q factor of each lattice, as shown in FIG. 2, is determined by the a dx ratio of the apertures and strips, while the resonance point f₁ is determined by the ratio dx λ of the period of the lattice to the wavelength λ. Therefore, by properly selecting a and dx, the lattice can be given any desired f₁ and Q. If the pass band of frequency separator is set in the L C resonance region of its lattices, the pass band can be further broadened, compared with that of a frequency separater using L resonance region. In this case too, however, if the apertures of the lattice are square, oblique incidence of electromagnetic waves on the FSRSs would cause the deterioration of the frequency separating performance. Next will be described an embodiment as shown in Fig. 9 in which this deterioration problem is reduced. The lattice 19 of rectangular periodic pattern has apertures 20 having a width a in the direction of the x axis and a width b in the direction of the y axis. Also, the lattice 19 is composed by conductive strip members 21 having a width W As illustrated in Figs. 10A and 10B, the vertical strips 21 function as inductances L in the case of TE incident waves or as capacitances C in TM incident waves, while the horizontal strips 22 act as capacitances C in TE incident waves or as inductances L in FM incident waves. As shown in Fig. 10B, an inductance L It was observed in an experiment that, as the angle of incidence ε widened, the resonance frequency of the TE wave shifted toward a lower frequency region. This TE wave resonance frequency is also dependent on the period dx in the horizontal direction, so that it can be returned to its original frequency by reducing dx. The TM wave resonance frequency is dependent on the aperture size dy, so that it can be brought closer to the TE wave resonance frequency by reducing dy. Since the reduction of dx and dy by oblique incidence results in smaller equivalent inductances and a greater Q, these consequences can be compensated for by reducing the strip widths wx and wy in order to increase the inductances. Fig. 11 shows experimental data on the transmission loss frequency characteristic of the FSRS, illustrated in FIG. 9. By putting together a rectangular lattice A manifesting the characteristic shown in FIG. 11A and another rectangular lattice B manifesting the characteristic shown in FIG. 11B into a three layer combination A B A as illustrated in FIG. 12, there is provided a frequency separator having a broad pass band as shown in Fig. 11C. Reference numerals 23s in Figs. 11A and 11B respectively, represent resonance points. The angle of incidence ϑ of signals coming into the separator is 20 , and the intervals between adjoining lattices are 8.9 mm each. The rectangular lattices 19 were designed with reference to theoretical analyses by the Moment method, and the specific dimensions dx, dy, a and b of their apertures and plate thickness are stated in Fig. 11 in millimeters. As is obvious from the frequency characteristics in Fig. 11C, the arrangement of lattices, structured as shown in Fig. 9, in the manner illustrated in Fig. 12 eliminates the difference in characteristics for different planes of polarization in the case of oblique incidence, or approximately equalizes the resonance characteristics of the TE incident wave and the TM incident wave. As a result, the pass band of the separator can be instituted about 4 GHz in its width, as seen from Fig. 11 C. However, there still is a dip, represented by a reference numeral 24 in Fig. 11C, correspondingly limiting the pass band width. The occurence of such a dip can be explained in the following way. The rectangular lattice arrangement shown in Fig. 9 can be regarded as an LC parallel resonant circuit in which an inductive strip grating and a capacitive strip grating are combined. The oblique incidence of a TE wave on this lattice arrangement can be substantially explained by the function of the LC resonsant circuit. However, if a TM wave comes in, a TE₁₁ mode 25 will be induced on the apertures as illustrated in Fig. 13A and therefore, the equivalent circuit cannot be represented by a simple LC parallel resonant circuit around the dip. Thus, due to the presence of the TE₁₁ mode, there will newly arise capacitances 26 between vertical and horizontal strips as shown in Fig. 13B. By the actions of these capcitances and the inductances of the lattice, there arises the dip point 24 Fig. 11C in the case of TM incidence. In the rectangular lattice 19 of Fig. 9 in such a case, since the TE₁₁ mode occurring in the upper aperture and that arising in the lower aperture are the same in pattern of distribution and in phase as illustrated in Fig. 13A, these effects reinforce each other by interactions and thereby substantially affect the characteristic of the separator. Therefore, with a view to obviating these interactions, the present invention displaces the apertures of the rectangular lattice in relative arrangement between their adjoining rows. Fig. 14 shows a plane view of an FSRS composed in such a manner. In Fig. 14, the pattern of the rectangular lattice is a brickwork arrangement wherein a periodic pattern 27, consisting of a conductor, is displaced to a prescribed extent in the direction of the x axis. This arrangement makes it possible to control the position of the dip point attributable to a TM incident wave. Thus in the rectangular lattice arrangement illustrated in Fig. 14, since the TE₁₁ mode occurring in the upper row of the pattern and that arising in the lower row of the pattern are aligned with each other neither in distribution pattern nor in phase as shown in Fig. 15, the effects of the capacitances 26 work in the mutually weakening direction. Accordingly, the dip point 24 Fig. 11C attributable to the TM incident wave can be shifted toward a higher frequency and outside the band. The results of calculations by the Moment method with respect to individual lattices are shown in Fig. 16, with the ratio of horizontal displacement of the lattice Sx dx being set at 0, 0.2, and 0.5. The dimensions of the lattice are, as expressed with reference to Fig. 14 dx 12.25 mm, dy 11.51 mm, a 11.22 mm and b 10.82 mm. Whereas the dip point shifts according to the ratio of displacement Sx dx as shown in Fig. 16, it may be understood that the shifting effect is the greatest at a displacement ratio of 50 percent. The experimentally measured values of the individual transmission loss frequency characteristics of FSRSs C and D, whose lattices are displaced by 50 percent as stated above, are illustrated in Figs. 17A and 17B, respectively, and those of the transmission loss frequency characteristics of the three layer combination C D C of these FSRSs C and D in the same manner as shown in Fig. 12 are given in Fig. 17C. These measured values are well in agreement with the calculated values shown in Fig. 16. The pass band is broadened by about 2 GHz than that shown in Fig. 11 C by the shift of the dip point. The principle of the present invention does not only apply to rectangular aperture lattices but also to circular, elliptical, crossed aperture lattices or aperture lattices of any shapes including combinations thereof. These lattice patterns may be formed on a dielectric substrate. Although Fig. 14 illustrates the horizontal displacement of the lattice, it can also be displaced vertically. An example of such vertical displacement is shown in Fig. 18, and the calculation results of its transmission frequency characteristic by the Moment method are given in Fig. 19. The dip point shifting effect of this vertical displacement, though smaller than that of the horizontal displacement, is evident, seeming to promise a broader band for a separator in which FSRSs are arranged as illustrated in Fig. 12, as in the case of Fig. 17C. The dimensions of the lattice shown in Fig. 18 are dx 12.25 mm, dy 11.51 mm, a 11.22 mm and b 10.82 mm. Fig. 20 illustrates the structure of a low pass type FSRS in which the metallic parts 29 and the aperture parts 28 are reversed, and this type of FSRS and a high pass type FSRS would complement each other. The metallic parts 29 are preferably formed on a dielectric substrate. The individual transmission frequency response of this lattice is shown in Fig. 21A, and the characteristic of a three layer combination of such lattices, like in Fig. 12, is shown in Fig. 21 B. A peak point 30 in the figures limits the width of the reflective band, but it can be shifted to broaden the band by displacing the lattice pattern, as in the case of the high pass type lattice described above. Our experiment has shown that a mutual displacement between the apertures of lattices in the three layer combination separator as shown in Fig. 12 causes substantial differences in the frequency characteristics from that of another three layer combination separator with its apertures identical to each other. Figs. 22A 22F illustrate some conceivable applications of the frequency separator according to the present invention. Fig. 22A shows a separator 31 according to the invention, formed in a curved shape and used as a beam waveguide curved mirror. Reference numeral 32 represents curved reflective mirrors, and reference numerals 33 represent electromagnetic feed horns. Figs. 22B and 22C show a flat frequency separating FSRS 34 according to the invention used as beam waveguides. In each of Figs. 22D and 22F there is depicted a frequency sharing antenna by implementing the invention in the form of a sub reflective mirror 36 for a Cassegrain and parabolic antennas, respectively. Reference numeral 35 represents a main reflective mirror. Fig. 22E illustrates an instance in which a frequency sharing horn is composed by inserting a frequency separating FSRS 37 according to the present invention into an electromagnetic feed horn.
