# BUILDING SYSTEM AND COMPONENTS THEREOF

## Abstract
The invention relates to a building process and means for in situ casting of structures as houses, buildings, dikes, silos, piping, culverts and the like. It is especially suited for building in series a given structure. More in particular, it refers to a mold formed by a number of parts to be assembled at the construction site and the use thereof. The mold is assembled on site and a castable material capable of hardening to a load bearing structure, such as concrete, is poured into the mold. The thus cast structure than becomes a solid monolith. Once the structure is dry, the mold is completely or partially disassembled, taken to the next construction site and the process repeated. Particular mold elements and devices and techniques for use in conjunction with the molds are also described.
