# MANUFACTURE OF FABRIC, ESPECIALLY FOR TYRE REINFORCEMENT

## Abstract
Apparatus for the manufacture of fabric, especially tyre building fabric ply material, in which a pair of rotatable parallel spindles 61, 62 are each surrounded by a helical member 70 rotatable in the opposite direction to the respective spindles. The opposite rotation of the spindles and the helical members helps to ensure a uniform winding as fabric is built up from filamentary material 50 applied around the spindles from a feeding head 55 rotating around the spindles.
