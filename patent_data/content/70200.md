# Process for the preparation of diesters of saturated carboxylic acids.

## Abstract
A process is described concerning the catalytic prepara tion of diesters of saturated dicarboxylic acids, starting from olefinic hydrocarbon compounds. The process is characterized in that an olefinic hydrocar bon having the formula R₁CH CHR₂, wherein R₁ and R₂ represent indifferently hydrogen atoms, alkyl groups having up to 6 carbon atoms, alkylaryl , arylalkyl groups having up to 8 carbon atoms, is made to react, possibly in an inert reaction medium, with a compound of copper II Cu OR X, wherein R represents an alkyl radical having up to 8 carbon atoms or an alcoxyethyl CH₂ CH₂OR radical, wherein R represes an alkyl radical having up to 6 carbon atoms and where X is chosen from between chlorine and bromine, and with carbon monoxide, in the presence of a Palladium catalyst and at a temperature comprised between about 20 C and 200 C about. Pd catalysts suited for this purpose, are salts thereof soluble in the reaction medium and or zerovalent Palladium compounds and or metal Palladium preferably there is used Pd acetylacetonate. The inert solvent medium is substantially anhydrous and preferably chosen between monofunctionai alcohols and ethyleneglycol mono ethers or it may be a hydrocarbon. As a CO source there may be used the industrial synthesis gas. The products thus obtained find their useful application in the field of plasticizers for synthetic resins, in the field of lubricants and of hydraulic fluids, etc.
