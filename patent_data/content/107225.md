# Process and burner for the partial combustion of solid fuel.

## Abstract
Coal and oxygen are supplied to a reactor space 10 via a central coal passage 9 and a plurality of inwardly inclined oxy gen outlet passages 13 , respectively. Each oxygen jet from an outlet passage 13 is surrounded by shield of a moderator gas from an annular passage 17 , preventing premature con tact of free oxygen with reactor gas and the premature escape of solid fuel, broken up by the oxygen jet from the break up zone.
