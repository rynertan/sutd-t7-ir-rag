# AUTOMATIC SPEED CONTROL SYSTEMS

## Abstract
An automatic speed control system particularly for use with coaches has a comparator 12 for comparing the actual road speed of the vehicle with a reference to produce an error signal for controlling the engine power via a control unit 18 so as to hold the vehicle at the desired speed. In addition the error signal is fed to a comparator 52 which, if the error signal indicates too high an excess speed, provides positive retardation of the vehicle via a retardation unit 30 which may be the actual brakes of the vehicle or preferably its electric retarder. A comparator 54 may also be arranged to be responsive to excess engine speed and to actuate the retarder via an OR gate 60 .
