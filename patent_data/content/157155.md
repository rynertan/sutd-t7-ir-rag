# Closure material for sealing glass containers.

## Abstract
A closure material for sealing glass containers com prising a metal foil 1 and a thermally adhesive composition layer 2 formed on one surface of the metal foil and com prising a carboxyl modified saponified product of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and up to 30 parts by weight of an inorganic compound per 100 parts by weight of the carboxyl modified saponified product, the carboxyl modified saponi fied product being prepared by graft polymerizing a car boxylic acid group containing unsaturated compound with a saponified product of ethylene vinyl acetate copolvmer containing 50 to 97 mole of ethylene.
