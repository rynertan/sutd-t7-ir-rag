# Suspension structure for an automotive vehicle.

## Abstract
The pitching motion of the vehicle can be sup pressed by a pitch suppressing member interpositioned between a suspension upper and lower members. The pitch suppressing member is fixed to the suspension upper member and connected to the suspension lower member via upper and lower links. The pitch suppressing member and the upper and lower links are so connected that the pitching force will act on respective upper and lower links in opposite direction to provide opposite directions of rotational torques. Bushings interpositioned between the pitch suppressing member and upper and lower links are provided with enough rigidity or sup pressing the pitching motion of the vehicle. On the other hand, bushings between the pitch suppressing member and the vehicle floor member are provided with enough flexibility for satisfactorily absorbing bounding and re bounding force due to road shock.
