# NMR IMAGING APPARATUS

## Abstract
In an NMR imaging apparatus, a series of sequences each including the excitation and measurement of nuclear spins and wait for awaiting the growth of the nuclear spins in the direction of a magnetostatic field are repeatedly per formed so as to image the spin density distribution etc. of an object 91 in two dimensions. The apparatus comprises sequence control means 1 2 to apply an RF magnetic field pulse and gradient magnetic field pulses for rendering the phases of the nuclear spins of the object uniform after the measurement of the nuclear spins and to subsequently apply an RF magnetic field pulse for flipping back the nuclear spins of the uniform phases into the sense of the magnetostatic field.
