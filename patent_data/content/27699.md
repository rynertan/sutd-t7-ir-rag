# Process for the production of anti static thermoplastics films and the films thereby produced.

## Abstract
An oriented thermoplastics film, e.g. a polyethylene terephthalate film, having an anti static layer in which the film is produced by a process in which the film is oriented by stretching in at least one direction, and preferably biaxially oriented by stretching in two mutually perpendicular direc tions, and a coating composition comprising i an acrylic or methacrylic copolymer, which is preferably cross linkable and ii an alkyl or aryl phosphate ester present as the free acid or as a partial or complete sodium or potassium salt is applied before the commencement of or during the molecular orienta tion.
