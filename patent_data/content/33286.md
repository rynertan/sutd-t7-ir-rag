# POLARIZING MEANS FOR MATEABLE UNITS SUCH AS ELECTRICAL CONNECTORS

## Abstract
Releasably removable and adjustable polarizing means 30 for mateable assemblies 10,20 and comprising a keyway 72 disposed in one assembly and a polarizing pin 40 mounted in a slotted bore disposed in the other assembly, the pin having a roud base 42 and a polarizing key 52 extending axially from the base, the base being provided with a plurality of longitudinally disposed projections 50 extending radially therefrom. A transverse cross section of the slotted bore is somewhat smaller than the transverse cross section of the base so as to provide a tight interference fitment therebet ween. Another embodiment includes the one assembly hav ing a like slotted bore and provides a multisided insert 60 having the keyway disposed therein, the insert and base being interchangeably fitable within the slotted bore of either assembly 10,20 .
