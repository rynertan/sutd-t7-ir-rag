# Power supply with load transient anticipation.

## Abstract
The varying loads 1 to which a power supply is subjec ted are anticipated before being placed across the power supply output by deriving device selection, direction of load change, and timing data from the control data transmitted to the load. The on and off times of the power trans former primary switch 12 in a switching regulator power supply are adjusted for optimum power supply response to the changed load. The calculations and ajustment are made before any load change has occured and the proper control signal 5, 6 to the switching regulator power supply are applied prior to or simultaneous with the load change.
