# Distillation plate.

## Abstract
A baffle system for use on a plate for mass transfer opera tions comprises at least one channel 1, the surface 5 of the channel through which a two phase mixture of liquid and vapour leaves the channel having a plurality of holes 8. A deflector 9 is immediately adjacent to each hole, and the deflector is in line to deflect the two phase mixture towards one end of the channel 1. A liquid return zone is defined by the space 13 between two channels 1 and 2 laterally adjacent to each other. Disengaged liquid from the two phase mixture collects in the liquid return zones 13 and passes through slots 10 in the channel sides 3 and 4 to re enter the channel. The baffle system has an inlet weir 4 which blocks off one end of the or each two phase channel, so that inlet liquid is fed to the liquid return zones. An outlet weir blocks off the other end of the or each two phase channel and the liquid return zones.
