# Hydraulic brake booster.

## Abstract
A hydraulic brake booster of the kind comprising a spring balanced control valve 42 controlling communica tion of pressurized fluid to a pressure chamber 14 in response to an operator input, the magnitude of the fluid pressure level in said pressure chamber depending upon the balance of spring forces applied to the control valve by a pair of opposed springs 50, 82 . An adjustable assembly 92 is provided which engages one 50 of the springs for adjusting its bias and thus limiting to a safe value the maximum fluid pressure level in the pressure chamber, said assembly 92 including a pair of relatively rotatable members 106, 108 which abut each other by means of oblique cam surfaces 122, 124 and can be spread apart by rotating one of them through a stem 118 . For use in automotive power brake systems.
