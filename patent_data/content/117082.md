# Thiazole derivatives, processes for the preparation thereof and pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.

## Abstract
New thiazole derivatives for the formula CHEM wherein R 1 is lower alkyl, carboxy, a derivative of carboxy, hydroxymethyl, halomethyl, lower alkylthiomethyl, hydroxyiminomethyl or alkenyl which may be substituted with lower alkoxycarbonyl, pyridyl or cyano. R 2 is hydrogen, hydroxy, lower alkyl, pyridyl, amino, lower alkylamino, pyridylamino, arylamino, acylamino, N lower alkylN acylamino, guanidino optionally substituted with dimethylaminomethylene, or ar lower alkylamino optionally substituted with lower alkoxy, R 3 is lower alkyl, halo lower alkyl or N containing unsaturated heterocyclic group which may be substitued with halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, carboxy, a derivative of carboxy, hydroxy, pyridyl, amino, lower alkylamino, pyridylamino, arylamino, acylamino, N lower alkyl N acylamino, guanidino, N oxide or ar lower alkylamino optionally substituted with lower alkoxy, Q is CO , and n is an integer of 0 or 1, provided that when both of R 1 and R 3 are lower alkyl then n is an integer of 1 and R 2 is lower alkyl, pyridyl, amino lower alkylamino, pyridylamino, arylamino, acylamino, N lower alkyl N acylamino, guanidino optionally substituted with dimethylaminomethylene, or ar lower alkylamino optionally substituted with lower alkoxy, and when R 1 is lower alkyl and R 3 is halo lower alkyl then n is an integer of 1, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and processes for preparation thereof and pharmaceutical composition comprising the same. These derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are useful as cardiotonic agents and anti ulcer agents.
