# OPTICAL FIBRES

## Abstract
Polarisation beam splitters combiners or polarisation insensitive beam splitters combiners are manufactured from low or zero birefringence single mode optical fibre, rather than high birefringence fibre, by using a differential pulling technique to induce the appropriate amount of form birefringence.
