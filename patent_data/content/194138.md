# Magnetic disk driving device.

## Abstract
A magnetic disk driving device is adapted such that by closure of an outer cover, a magnetic disk is press fitted on a spindle by a push of push members without producing any play and the rotating surface of the magnetic disk is fixed by a regulating member, and by clamping of the outer cover, which is effected when the outer cover has once reached the position closest to a base and then slightly retreated therefrom, the push members are separated from the magnetic disk by means of relative movements of the outer cover and a plate with the positional relationship between the magnetic disk and the regulating member kept as it is.
