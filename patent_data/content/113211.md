# A MEMBRANE SWITCH ASSEMBLY FOR CATHODE RAY TUBES AND MOUNTING THEREOF

## Abstract
A transparent membrane switch assembly 10 and mounting means 118 for mounting the assembly 10 to a cathode ray tube CRT 68 are disclosed. The assembly 10, 10 is comprised of two layers 12, 16 of transparent film having spaced apart parallel double fineline conductors 20 deposited on the internal surfaces 14, 18 of both layers 12, 16 . The mounting means 118 comprise extension 114 protruding from the perimeter 116 of at least one of the layers of film, and a patch of a coupled fastening assembly 120 attached to each extension 114 . Each fastening assembly comprises two separable parts, an outer surface 124 of one part being attachable to a side surface of a CRT when the switch assembly is registered with the CRT face.
