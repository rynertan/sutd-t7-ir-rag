In one embodiment of the present invention, each latching mechanism of which there are two in the preferred embodiment comprises but two separate components. Each latching mechanism comprises one camming member and one buckling column spring. The spring bias the camming members in a first position such that a portion of the camming member protrudes into the path the cartridge will travel as it is inserted into the tape machine. When the cartridge is inserted, the leading edge of the cartridge engages that portion of the camming member. The camming member is pivoted and moves to a second position the camming member comes to rest in its second position, in engagement with the notch provided as a standard feature on the bottom edge of the cartridge. Removal of the cartridge is accomplished by manually pulling the cartridge out of the tape machine.
