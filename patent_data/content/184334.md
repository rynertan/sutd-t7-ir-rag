# Methods of and apparatus for determining maximum spray flow limits of attemperators.

## Abstract
A maximum spray flow limit for an attemperator is determined by using attemperator steam inlet pressure measured by a pressure sensor 10 and temperature measured by a temperature sensor 12 to calculate enthalpy. The enthalpy contributed by water spray flow to the attemperator is derived from a spray temperature sensor 40 and may be used in the calculation to determine enthalpy per unit load. The enthalpy per unit load is multiplied in a multiplication block 36 by the actual load of the boiler being serviced by the attemperator to produce a maximum spray flow limit on a line 44 for the attemperator.
