# Process for forming a patterned mask using a positive electron beam resist.

## Abstract
A positive working electron beam resist comprising a resinous condensation product of formaldehyde with a phenol or a cresol having a chloro substituent ortho to the hydroxyl group on its aromatic ring is imagewise exposed to electron beam irradiation and then the exposed portion of the resist is dissolved away to leave a petterned mask.
