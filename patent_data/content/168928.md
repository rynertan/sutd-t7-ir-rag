# WRAPPING FILM OF ETHYLENE COPOLYMERS

## Abstract
A wrapping film suitable for pallet stretch wrap applications is manufactured by the blown bubble process with extra cooling at the frost line from a blend of a linear ethylene alpha olefin copolymer containing 3 to 18 by weight of alpha olefin and from 10 to 75 or more preferably from 45 to 55 by weight of the blend of a linear ethylene butene 1 copolymer containing 3 to 18 by weight of butene 1. The alpha olefin is predominantly a C₆ to C₈ monomer or isomer thereof with or without a minor amount of a second different C₄ to C₈ olefin monomer, for example butene 1. Films of the blend have both high clarity and desirable tear resistance and break elongation properties. The films may contain a tackifying agent such as poly isobutylene.
