# Control system.

## Abstract
A rotary entry control system for control apparatus in cluding a microprocessor comprises rotary entry logic en coding means, in the form of a rotary switch SWI , for incre menting and decrementing first desired data into the mi croprocessor, additional means 30 for entering additional data into the microprocessor and multiplexed display means DSI controlled by the microprocessor in response to the signals at its input terminals. The additional means 30 is preferably in the form of a manually actuable rotary potentiometer and the display means includes means for in dicating the additional data in the form of a segmented bar graph. The control system may easily be understood and operated and is, therefore, useful in controlling appliances such as microwave ovens, dishwashers, washing machines and television sets.
