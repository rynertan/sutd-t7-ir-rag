## Abstract
Disclosed is an electrical interlock to prevent unauthor ized access to potentially hazardous equipment and an associated circuit to detect if a safety shield or closure member is open, not securely closed or has been tampered with and to thereupon automatically de energize the equip ment. The detection circuit, which may comprise a balanced bridge incorporating the electrical interlock into a leg thereof also provides a visual or audio indication when the bridge is unbalanced thereby indicating an improperly closed safety shield.
