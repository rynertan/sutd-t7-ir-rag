The leaving group Q is a group that is readily displaceable by a nucleophile. Examples of such groups are hydroxy, halogen such as chloro and bromo, acyloxy such as C1 4 alkanoyloxy, C1 4 alkoxycarbonyloxy and activiated hydrocarbyloxy such as pentachlorophenoxy.Another example of an acyloxy group Q is when Q is joined to R1 to form O CO NG wherein G is hydrogen or an R1 amino substituent in the resultant compound of formula I . If the leaving group is hydroxy, then the reaction is preferably carried out in an inert nn hydroxylic solvent, such as benzene, toluene or diethyl ether in the presence of a dehydrating catalyst, such as a carbodiimide, for example dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.The reaction may be carried out at a non extreme temperature such as 10 to 100 C, for example 0 to 80 C. If the leaving group is a halide, then the reaction is preferably carried out at a non extreme temperature in an inert non hydroxylic solvent, such as dichloromethane, benzene, toluene or diethyl ether. It is also preferably carried out in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as an organic base, in particular a tertiary gamine such as triethylamine, trimethylamine, pyridine or picoline, some of which can also function as the solvent. Alternatively, the acid acceptor can be inorganic, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate.

If the leaving group is C14 alkoxycarbonyloxy, then the reaction is preferably carried out in an inert solvent, such as methylene chloride, at a non extreme temperature in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as triethylamine. If the leaving group is activated hydrocarbyloxy then the reaction is preferably carried out in an inert polar solvent, such as dimethylformamide. It is also preferred that the activated hydrocarbyloxy group is a pentachlorophenyl ester and that the reaction is carried out at ambient temperature. Preferably Q is halogen, such as chloro. The compounds of formula XIX and XX are either known compounds or can be prepared analogously to the preparation of structurally similar known compounds. Compounds of formula XIX wherein R3 is aminosulphonyl may be formed from the corresponding R3 chlorosulphonyl derivatives of the compound of formula XIX wherein R3 is hydrogen, with a suitable amine or ammonla. The skilled man will appreciate that the choice or necessity of conversion of groups R1, R2 and or R3 to other groups R1, R2 and or R3 will be dictated by the nature and position of substituents R1, R2 and R3. It will be apparent that compounds of the formula I containing an R1, R2, R3 or R5 group which is convertible to another R1, R2 and R3 group or to an R5 group are useful novel intermediates. A number of such conversions is possible not only for the end compounds of fomula I , but also for their intermediates as follows a an hydrogen substituent is convertible to a nitro substituent by nitration b a nitro substituent is convertible to an amino substituent by reduction c a C14 acylamino substituent is convertible to an amino substituent by deacylation d an amino substituent is convertible to a C1 4 acylamino substituent by acylation e a hydrogen substituent is convertible to a halogen substituent by halogenation f a C1 6 alkylthio or C1 6 alkylsulphinyl substituent is convertible to a C16 alkylsulphinyl or a C1 6 alkylsulphonyl substituent respectively by oxidation and g an amino substituent is convertible to a C16 alkyl S02NR14 or NR12R13 SO2NR14 substituent by reaction with C16 alkyl S02NQ2 or NR12R13S02Q2 where Q2 is leaving group. h a fluoro or chloro substituent is convertible to an optionally substituted amino substituent by reaction with a suitable amine or ammonia. Conversions a to h are only exemplary and are not exhaustive of the possibilities. In regard to a , nitration is carried out in accordance with known procedures. In regard to b , the reduction is carried out in accordance with known procedures, for example, with a reagent suitable for reducing nitroanisole to aminoanisole. In regard to c , deacylation is carried out by treatment with a base, such as an alkali metal hydroxide. In regard to d , the acylation is carried out with an acylating agent, such as the corresponding acid or acid chloride. Formylation is carried out with the free acid. In regard to e , halogenation is carried out with conventional halogenating agents. In regard to f , oxidation is carried out at below ambient temperatures in a non aqueous solvent, such as a chlorinated hydrocarbon, in the presence of an organic peracid, such as 3 chloroperbenzoic acid, or in water in the presence of a soluble strong inorganic oxidant, such as an alkali metal permanganate or in aqueous hydrogen peroxide. In regard to g , Q2 is often halide, for example chloride or bromide, or hydroxy. When halide is the leaving group, the reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a base. When hydroxy is the leaving group, the reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a dehydrating agent, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, in an inert sovent at non extreme temperature, such as ambient temperature. In regard to h , the amination is carried out under conventional conditions using an inert solvent such as CH2C12 or an excess of amine also functioning as the solvent. Depending on steric and or electronic factors and or reaction conditions mono or di acylation may occur. If diacylation takes place, subsequent selective monodeacylation of the resultant compound is necessary to form the desired alkyl or aminosulphonylamino group. Treatment with a base such as methanolic sodium hydroxide at ambient or slightly elevated temperaturesIs apt. It is often most convenient to affect the coupling of compounds XIX and XX using a compound of formula XIX wherein R1 is chloro or fluoro, preferably fluoro and to convert the relevant minor group in the coupling product to optionally substituted amino. Similarly, it is often most convenient to effect the coupling of compounds XIX and XX using a compound of formula XIX wherein one of R2 and R3 is amino and to convert alkyl or aminosulphonylamino. It will be appreciated that, R5 when optionally substituted benzyl as hereinbefore defined, may be replaced by another group R5. Such R5 benzyl groups may be removed for example when R1, R2 or R3 is not halogen by conventional transition metal catalysed hydrogenolysis to give compounds of the formula XXI EMI23.1 wherein R41 is R4 wherein the R5 substituent is replaced by hydrogen and the remaining variable groups are as defined in formula I . This invention also provides an optional process step in the preparation of a compound of the formula I which comprises the reaction of a corresponding compound of the formula XXI as hereinbefore defined with a compound Q3R5 wherein R5 is as defined in formula I and Q3 is a leaving group, and optionally forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the resulting compound of the formula I . Suitable values for Q3 include groups readily displaced by nucleophiles such as C1, Br, I, OS02CH3 orOSO2C6H4pCH3. Favoured values for Q3 include C1, Br and I. Particularly suitably the compound Q3R5 is a benzyl halide, such as the bromide or chloride. The reaction may be carried out under conventional alkylation conditions for example in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide in the presence of an acid acceptor such as potassium carbonate. Generally the reaction is carried out at non extreme temperature such as at ambient or at a slightly elevated temperature. Converting R5 to another R5 in the compound of the formula XX before coupling with the compound of the formula XIX or its derivative is preferred. Such interconversions are effected conveniently under the above conditions. It is desirable to protect the amine function with a group readily removable by hydrolysis such as a C27 alkanoyl group before R5 interconversion. The substituents in the phenyl ring when Rg is benzyl in a compound of formula I , in particular the substituted C14 alkyl substituents, are lnterconvertlble. A number of such lnterconverslons are possible not only for the end compounds of formula I , but also for their intermediates as follows 1 a carboxy C1 4 alkyl substituent is convertible to an esterified carboxy C1 4 alkyl substituent by esterification 11 an esterified carboxy C1 4 alkyl substituent is convertible to a carboxy C1 4 alkyl substituent by deesterification t1ll Cl4 alkoxy C1 4 alkyl substituent or an in vivo hydrolysable C2 4 acyloxy C1 4 alkyl substituent is convertible to an hydroxy C1 4 alkyl substituent iv an optionally esterified carboxy or carboxy C1 3 alkyl substituent is convertible to an hydroxymethyl or hydroxy C2 4 alkyl substituent by reduction and v a hydroxy C1 4 alkyl is convertible to C1 4 alkyl by O alkylation or in vivo hydrolysable C2 4 acyloxy C1 4 alkyl by O acylation. Conversions 1 to iv are only exemplary and are not exhaustive of the possibilities. In regard to 1 and 11 , the esterification and de esterification reactions are carried out in conventional manner. In regard to iii , a C14 alkoxy C1 4 alkyl substituent is convertible to an hydroxy C14 alkyl substituent by conventional methods, such as warming with aqueous hydrobromic acid or by treatment with pyridine hydrochloride, boron tribromide, boron triodide or iodotrimethylsilane. As in vivo hydrolysable C24 acyloxy C1 4 alkyl substituent is convertible to an hydroxy C14 alkyl substituent by acid or base hydrolysis. In regard to iv , the reduction is carried out with a selective metal complex hydride, for example lithium aluminium hydride, under conventional conditions. In regard to v , O alkylation is carried out under conventional conditions in an inert solvent at a non extreme temperature such as ambient temperature or slightly above or at reflux temperature. The C14 alkylating agent has a leaving group that is readily displaceable by a nucleophile. Examples of leaving groups include halide, such as chloride, bromide or iodide, or labile acyloxy groups, such as mesyl or tosyl. O acylation is carried out under conventional conditions with an acylating agent which has an acyl group capable of forming an in vivo hydrolysable acyloxy group and a leaving group, such as halide, for example chloride and bromide, and hydrogen. When halide is the leaving group, the reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a base. When hydroxy is the leaving group, the reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a dehydrating agent, such as dicylohexylcarbodiimide, in an inert solvent at non extreme temperature, such as ambient temperature or slightly above, or reflux temperature. Before carrying out any of these conversions, the effect, if any, on other substituents should be considered, and such reagents as are appropriate should be selected together with the adoption of such precautionary measures as are necessary. For example,O alkylation and O acylation may also produceN alkylated and N acylated products respectively unless the nitrogen atom s is are previously protected.This may be conveniently achieved by carrying out the alkylation or acylation reaction in a strong acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid, which protonates, and thereby protects, the nitrogen atom s . Compounds of the formula XXI are novel intermediates and thus form as aspect of the present invention. It will be realised that in the compound of the formula I the X Y linkage may have an alpha or B orientation with respect to the ring of the bicyclic moiety to which it is attached. A mixture of a and ss isomers of the compound of the formula I may be systheslsed non stereospeclflcally and the deslred isomer separated conventionally therefrom eg by chromatography or alternatively the a and ss isomer may if desired by synthesised from the corresponding a or ss form of the compound of the formula XX . Synthesis from the corresponding a or ss isomer of the compound of the formula XX is in general preferred. It will be appreciated that, when X is NH, Y is CO and n O in the compounds of the formulae I or XX , eplmerlsatlon of the CO ring linkage to the energetically more favourable orientation often takes place readily in the presence of acid or base. In such cases if the less favoured isomer is desired, it is preferred to stereospecifically synthesise the isomer of the compound of the formula XX and to convert it to the required comound of the formula I under such conditions to avoid epimersation. The a or B form of the compound of the formula XX may if desired be prepared by known stereospecific processes, such as those leading to the a or ss isomers of the compound of the formula XX depicted in theScheme and described in the Descriptions hereinafter. Compounds of the formula XX are known from or are preparable by the methods disclosed in publishedEuropean Patent Applications and U.S. Patents. SCHEME 1EMI28.1 Pharmaceutically acceptable salts1 hydrates andN oxides of the compounds of this invention may be formed conventionally. The salts may be formed for example by reaction of the base compound of formula I with a Pharmaceutically acceptable orqanic or inorqanic acid. N oxides of the nitroqen atom of the bicyclic rinq system are produced by reaction of a compound of formula I with an orqanic Peracid. such as m chloroperbenzoic acid in, for example, a chlorinated hvdrocarbon solvent at below ambient temperature. Quaternarv ammonium salts may be prepared by reaction of a compound of the present invention with the appropriate alkyl. acryl. aralkyl chloride. bromide or iodide. This reaction may be carried out in a solvent, such as acetone, methanol, ethanol dimethylformamide at ambient or elevated temperature with or without Pressure.

Measured 477.0733, calculated for C21H24BrN3Q3S 477.0719 Pharmacological DataGastric Motility Enhancing Activity 1 Increase in lntragastrlc pressure Intragastric pressure changes were recorded from previously starved conscious but restrained rats using a saline filled catheter inserted into the lumen of the stomach via a permanent gastric fistula. The catheter was connected to a physiological pressure transducer and pressure changes recorded on a hot wire pen recorder.In each animal a pre dose period of 40 minutes was allowed to obtain a measure of spontaneous activity. An index of activity was obtained by measuring the average height of pressure waves during 10 minute periods. Values for 4 such periods were obtained during assessment of spontaneous activity and for 40 minute period after administration of compound. Student s t test was applied to the difference in average values obtained for spontaneous and post compound activity. The compounds of Examples 3, 5 and 6 significantly increased index of activity post administration at a dose of 0.5 mg kg s.c. Heidenhain Pouch Test Male Beagle dogs 12 15 kg with a Heidenhain pouch were placed in slings in Pavlov stands.Experiments wre conducted at least 18 hours after the animals had last been fed. The motility of the pouch was monitored via an open tipped catheter inserted via the fistula and connected to a Bell and Howell type 44 22 pressure transducer. After suitable amplification the motility of the pouch was displayed on a hot wire pen recorder Ormed MX216 . Drugs were administered intravenously via a suitable peripheral vein. The compounds of Examples 2 and 6 were active at a dose of 0.5 mg kg s.c. The compound of Example 3 was active at a dose of 0.1 mg kg s.c. The compounds ofExamples 3 and 6 were active for a period of greater than 1 hour.Anti emetic activity in the dog Compounds were administered subcutaneously 30 minutes prior to administration of a standard dose of apomorphine HC1 0.1 mg kg subsutaneously and the vomiting response compared to that obtained when the same animals were dosed with apomorphine HC1 and vehicle only. The compound of Example 2 had an ED50 value of 0.1 mg kg s.c. and the compound of Example 6 had an EDso value of 0.5 mg kg s.c. The compound ofExample 12 was active at a dose of 0.01 mg kg s.c.Dopamine receptor blocking activity in the central nervous system Compounds were tested for inhibition of apomorphine induced climbing in the mouse. The test is based on that described by Protais, P., Constantin, J.and Schwartz J.C. 1976 , Psychopharmacology, 50, 1.6. Apomorphine 1 mg kg s.c. induces mice to climb the wall of a wire cage inverted food hopper 11 x 7.5 x 18 cm high . Mice acclimatised in their home cages in groups of 5 are placed under the hoppers immediately after the injection of apomorphine 1 mg kg s.c. At 10.20 and 30 minutes after injection climbing behaviour is scored. The mice are observed for 30 seconds and scored according to the position they spend the majority of time in, score 0 four paws on floor of cage score 1 fore paws only on walls score 2 all paws on wall of cage. The scores at all 3 times and for each mouse are summed and mice drug treated orally compared to mice receiving apomorphine only. A saline only treated group is also included and any score 55 of maximum taken lnto account. The compounds of Examples 2, 4, 5 and 6 were inactive at a dose of 10 mg kg s.c. The compound ofExample 3 was inactive at a dose of 25 mg kg s.c. Toxlcity No toxic effects were observed in the above tests.
