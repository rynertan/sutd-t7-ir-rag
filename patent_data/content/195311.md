## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING FATTY ACID ESTERS The present invention relates to a process for preparing sterol esters or specific aliphatic alcohol esters of fatty acids with use of an enzyme. Esters of sterols with fatty acids are widely used in various fields, for example, as cholestric liquid crystals see Unexamined Japanese PatentPublication SHO 52 24992 and hydrophilic base materials for pharmaceuticals and cosmetics seeUnexamined Japanese Patent Publications SHO 52 41215 and SHO 52 79030 . Such fatty acid sterol esters ahd the like have heretofore been prepared solely by organic synthetic processes, which generally employ severe reaction conditions, involve a side reaction and require complex procedures for the reaction and for the subsequent isolation and purification of the desired product. The hydroxyl group of sterols is secondary, is positioned close to the steroid skeleton and therefore exhibits reduced reactivity. For preparing fatty acid esters by reacting fatty acids with sterols, it is necessary to react the starting materials at a high temperature for a long period of time using an acid catalyst, or to convert the fatty acid to an acid anhydride or acid halide first before esterification.Further when the sterol material is trimethylsterol having two methyl groups at the 4 position of the steroid skeleton, one methyl at the 14 position and a hydroxyl group at the 3 position, the compound has still lower reactivity due to the steric hindrance of the two methyl groups at the 4 position and is difficult to esterify with a fatty acid unless the acid is converted to an acid halide. However, sterol esters which are useful for various applications are generally long chain fatty acid esters, and long chain fatty acid halides serving as materials for preparating such esters are usually difficult to obtain, need to be prepared specifically by a complex process and are very expensive.In addition, these fatty acid halides are generally unstable and prone to decomposition in the presence of moisture, are likely to give a stimulating corrosive by product during reaction and require a special reactor or the like. For preparing fatty acid esters by redacting sterols with fatty acid esters, the materials need to be reacted at a high temperature for a prolonged period of time in the presence of an inorganic catalyst such as sodium alcoholate. Such organic chemical processes have the drawback of being low in reaction selectivity and entailing deterioration of the substrate and consumption of a large amount of energy due to the use of severe conditions. Furthermore, they have the serious drawback of necessitating removal of the catalyst and being low in reaction yield. In recent years, research is under way on processes for synthesizing glycerides and terpene esters by the reverse reaction of hydrolases such as lipase instead of resorting to organic synthesis.Nevertheless, nothing has been reported on processes in which enzymes are used for synthesizing esters from fatty acids or fatty acid esters and sterols or branched aliphatic primary or secondary alcohols having 14 to 32 carbon atoms. Generally, enzyme reactions are substratespecific, and it is impossible to predict progress of an enzymatic synthesis reaction if a different compound is used as the contemplated substrate. It is also known that the equilibrium of a synthesis reaction with lipase usually predominantly proceeds reversely. Even the above mentioned processes investigated in reacent years require special means such as the reduction of the amount of water in the reaction system to the greatest possible extent so as to shift the equilibrium toward synthesis. Use of such an expedient results in a decreased reaction velocity, usually giving the desired ester in a reduced yield. An object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing a desired ester under moderate conditions, using an enzyme but without resorting to organic synthesis involving disadvantages such as severe reaction conditions. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing the desired ester economically with ease and in a high yield. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing the desired ester by a continuous or semicontinuous synthesis reaction using an enzyme repeatedly. These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent from the following description. The present invention provides a process for reacting 1 a component selected from the group consisting of sterols and branched aliphatic primary or secondary alcohols having 14 to 32 carbon atoms, and 2 a component selected from the group consisting of fatty acids and fatty acid esters in contact with an enzyme selected from the group consisting of lipase and cholesterol esterase or the selected enzyme in an immobilized form, in a system selected from the group consisting of an aqueous medium and water containing organic solvent to prepare a fatty acid ester of the component 1 . The process of the present invention affords the desired ester easily in a high yield under very moderate conditions with reduced energy consumption by using an enzyme, without severe reaction conditions, separate preparation of starting materials and special reactor or the like which are needed for conventional organic synthesis processes and further without involving disadvantages such as poor reaction selectivity, degradation of the substrate, use of other catalyst and removal thereof. Further with the process of the present invention, the reaction can be carried out continuously or semicontinuously by repeatedly using the enzyme, so that the process can be practiced automatically with ease to prepare the desired ester with a great reduction achieved in the amount of labor, manufacturing cost and equipment cost. Generally in synthesizing glycerides with use of lipase, it is essentially required to reduce the amount of water in the reaction system to the greatest possible extent except a minimum required for the enzyme to exhibit its activity so as to permit the synthesis reaction to proceed favorably, whereas in the presence of a reduced amount of water, the enzyme fails to fully exhibit its activity with a tendency for the reaction velocity to decrease. Nevertheless, the combination of substrates according to the invention permits the synthetic reaction to proceed favorably at a sufficiently high velocity even if the reaction system contains a large amount of water. The present process is there for especially suited to industrial operation. The enzyme to be used for the process of the invention is selected from the group consisting of lipase and cholesterol esterase. The term lipase refers to an enzyme for catalyzing the stepwise hydrolysis of a glyceride to glycerin and a fatty acid.The term cholesterol esterase It refers to an enzyme for hydrolyzing the ester of cholesterol and a fatty acid.The lipase and cholesterol esterase are not specifically limited in their origin, but various microorganisms, animals and vegetables can be their origins. Examples of microorganisms from which lipase is derived are those of the genus Achromobacter such asAchromobacter iofurgus and Achromobacter lipolyticum, the genus Chromobacterium such as Chromobacterium viscosum, the genus Corynebacterium such asCorynebacterium acnes, the genus Staphylococcus such asStaphylococcus aureus, the genus Aspergillus such asAspergillus niger, the genus Candida such as Candida cylindracea, the genus Humicora such as Humicora lanuginosa, the genus Penicillium such as Penicillium caseicolum, Penicillium crustosum, Penicillium cyclopium and Penicillium rogueforti, the genusTorulopsis such as Torulopsis ernobii, the genus Mucor such as Mucor miehei, the genus Bacillus such asBacillus subtilis, the genus Thermomyces such asThermomyces ibadanensis, the genus Rhizopus such asRhizopus delemar, the genus Pseudomonas such asPseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fragi andPseudomonas fluorescens, the genus Alcaligenes such asAlcaligenes sp, etc. Examples of useful origins from which cholesterol esterase is derived are those of the animal tissues such as pancreas, liver, brain, adrenal gland, testis, ovary, etc. Microorganisms are also preferably usable as the origins. Examples of the microorganisms are those of the genus Pseudomonas such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens, the genusAchromobacter such as Achromobacter delicatulus, the genus Fusarium, the genus Nocardia, the genus Streptomyces, the genus Candida such as Candida lipolytica, Candida tropicalis, Candida intermedia andCandida cylindracea, etc. A majority of enzymes of such origins are commercially available as purified enzymes. Although these commercial products are usable as they are in this invention, purified commercial products need not always be used. Similarly usable are, for example, cells of microorganism itself capable of producing the contemplated enzyme, a culture of such cells, a crude enzyme solution obtained by treating the culture, a composition containing the enzyme, etc. The immobilized enzyme to be used for the invention can be any of those prepared by immobilizing the above enzymes to suitable carriers by a usual method. The immobilized enzyme and preparation thereof will be described in detail later. The sterol to be used as one of the substrates to be subjected to a synthesis reaction using the enzyme or immobilized enzyme is a compound having a steroid skeleton and a hydroxyl group in the molecule. The stercid skeleton is represented by the formula I EMI9.1 Generally, the hydroxyl group is attached directly to the skeleton.

Fatty acid esters useful as the other substrate material of the invention include glycerin esters of the foregoing fatty acids and esters of these acids with aliphatic alcohols having 1 to 32 carbon atoms, preferably up to 14 carbon atoms.

The glycerin esters of fatty acids may be monoglycerides, diglycerides or triglycerides, or mixtures of such glycerides. Accordingly, fatty acid esters useful as starting materials of the invention include natural and synthetic oils and fats glycerides , natural and synthetic waxes, etc.Examples of useful natural oils and fats are vegetable oils such as linseed oil, olive oil, cacao butter, rice bran oil, soybean oil, tsubaki oil, rape seed oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, caster oil, cotton seed oil, japan wax, coconut oil, peanut oil, sunflower oil and the like, animal oils such as tallow, butterfat, mutton tallow, neats foot oil, whale oil, cod liver oil, sardine oil, orange roughy oil, herring oil and the like, hydrogenated oils of such oils. Examples of useful natural waxes are spermaceti, insect wax, carnauba wax, candelilla wax, rice bran wax, shellac, beeswax, montan wax, wool wax, cotton wax and the like For the reaction of this invention, these fatty acid esters are usable singly, or at least two of them can be used in admixture. The process of the invention can be practiced batchwise, semicontinuously or continuously. In any of these cases, the reaction can be conducted by bringing the component 1 and component 2 as substrates into contact with the above mentioned enzyme or immobilized enzyme. While the reaction merely proceeds when the substrates are contacted with the enzyme, it is usually desirable to mix them together by stirring. Our research has revealed that the reaction readily proceeds in an aqueous medium system or water containing organic solvent system containing the two phases of water and an organic solvent and that the synthesis ratio of the desired product is almost free of the influence of the reaction system. The term aqueous medium system refers to a reaction system comprising the enzyme, substrates, and water or the combination of water and a hydrophilic substance for dissolving the enzyme. The term watercontaining organic solvent system refers to a system comprising a water containing organic solvent capable of dissolving at least one of the substrates, i.e., a system comprising the substrates, enzyme activated with water, or with the combination of water and a hydrophilic substance, and a water containing organic solvent capable of dissolving at least one of the substrates. The term water containing organic solvent 1 means an organic solvent containing water to saturation or in a larger quantity.When the water content of this system exceeds the solubility of the organic solvent, the system comprises two phases, i.e., water and the organic solvent. In the case of this water organic solvent two phase system, the aqueous phase containing the enzyme or the enzyme and the hydrophilic substance can be separated from the organic solvent phase containing the substrates and the solvent by allowing the system to stand or subjecting the system to centrifuging, selective filtration or the like. These terms as hereinafter used have the same meaning as above. The hydrophilic substance is a substance which is miscible with water. Desirable as such a substance is one which will not inactivate the enzyme to the greatest.possible extent, such as glycerin. The organic solvent to be used for the water containing organic solvent phase is desirably one which is not miscible with water and which will not inactivate the enzyme to the greatest possible extent. Examples of useful organic solvents are hydrocarbon solvents such as n hexane, n heptane, n octane, isooctane, cyclohexane, n decane, n tridecane, n tetradecane, n hexadecane, polybutene, diisobutylene, fluid paraffin, squalane, squalene, pristane and the like.Similarly usable are mixtures of at least two of these hydrocarbons and solvents containing such hydrocarbons, such as tIP solvent 1016 product of IdemitsuPetrochemical Co., Ltd., isoparaffin type mixture comprising 63 of C8 component and 30 of Cg component . and ISOPAR E product of Exxon Chemicals, isoparaffin type mixture comprising 25 35 of C component and 75 60 of Cg component . Generally in synthesizing glycerides with use of an enzyme, the water content of the reaction system is a very important factor. In order to shift the equilibrium of the reaction in the direction toward synthesis, it is essentially required to reduce the water content to the greatest possible extent except a minimum quantity of water required for the enzyme to exhibit its activity. According to the present invention, the synthesis reaction proceeds favorably rapidly even when the reaction system contains a large amount of water. The reaction proceeds smoothly also in the water containing organic solvent system. Especially when the two phase system of water and organic solvent is used as the above mentioned system, the resulting reaction mixture contains the enzyme as distributed through the aqueous phase or over the interface between the water and the organic solvent, and the desired ester and unreacted substrates as distributed through the organic solvent phase.Consequently, the enzyme can be easily separated from the desired ester and unreacted substrates. Further when the organic solvent is used, sterols and higher aliphatic alcohols in solid form can be subjected to the reaction as dissolved in the solvent. This serves to improve the properties of the reaction mixture to advantageously effect the contact between the enzyme and the substrates. The reaction conditions need only to be such that the inactivation of the enzyme used is avoidable or minimized. Usually, an optimum pH and optimum temperature for the enzyme are used. This temperature is usually about 10 to about 60 C. When a thermostable enzyme such as thermostable lipase is used, a higher temperature is usable accordingly. The pH to be used is in accordance with the kind of enzyme used. When required, the pH is adjustable by adding to the reaction system a suitable acid or alkali, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, or a suitable buffer such as phosphate buffer.The reaction system may further contain an enzyme activator such as casein, albumin, calcium ion, bile acid or salt thereof, and a surfactant, which does not inhibit the enzyme activity, for assuring the contact between the substrates and the enzyme more effectively, such as Tween 80 1 product ofKao Atlaes Co., Ltd. and Triton X 100 product ofRohm Haas . The reaction system contains the enzyme and the substrates in a ratio which is not limited specifically but which can be suitably determined according to the kind of these substances, reaction conditions and method of practicing the present process, i.e., batchwise, continuous or semicontinuous repetition method . Usually, for one run of reaction, about 1 to about one million units1 preferably about 500 units to about 100,000 units, of lipase, or about 1 unit to about one million units, preferably about 5 units to about 100,000 units, most preferably about 50 units to about 50,000 units, of cholesterol esterase can be used per gram of the alcoholic starting material component 1 . The ratio between the component 1 and the component 2 can be determined suitably without any specific limitation, and either one can be used in an excessive amount.Usually, one substrate is used in an amount of about 0.1 to about 20 moles per mole of the other substrate For the enzyme to exhibit synthesis activity, at least about 10 mg of water is required per gram of the enzyme completely dry weight . The water is contained usually in the enzyme preparation, immobilizing carrier or substrates. Generally when an aqueous medium reaction system is to be used, the water content of the system, which is required for the activity of the enzyme, also relates to the state of contact between the enzyme and the substrates. To assure satisfactory contact and achieve a sufficient reaction velocity, water is used preferably in about 7 to about 10000 times, more preferably about 15 to about 700 times, the amount of the enzyme by weight.In the case of a water containing organic solvent system, the water saturating the organic solvent provides a sufficient amount of water required for the exhibition of the activity of the enzyme. When a fatty acid ester is used as one of the substrates, it is thought that the hydrolysis of the ester precedes the synthesis reaction, and the water in the system is partly consumed for the hydrolysis reaction. Accordingly, if the amount of water is limited to a quantity saturating the organic solvent, a reduced synthesis reaction velocity could result. It is therefore usually desirable that the reaction system have a water content in excess of the solubility of the organic solvent to serve as a water organic solvent two phase system.Alternatively it is desirable to use an immobilized enzyme retaining a sufficient amount of water in its immobilizing carrier. This assures a high synthesis reaction velocity and a high yield. When the water organic solvent two phase system is used which has a water content in excess of the solubility of the organic solvent, the enzyme is present locally in the aqueous phase and at the water solvent interface, so that the enzyme can be separated from the substrates for reuse, by separating the aqueous phase from the organic solvent phase, hence advantageous. The water to solvent ratio of the watercontaining organic solvent system, especially the amount of water present in the system, influences the reaction velocity to some extent. It is therefore desirable to determine the amount of water according to the kind of substrates to be used, kind of enzyme and solvent, method of mixing these substances, shape and size of the reactor, overall volume of reaction system and other reaction conditions. For example, when a sterol is to be reacted with a fatty acid in a watercontaining organic solvent system wherein isooctane is used, it is preferable to use isooctane in about 0.001 to about 100 times, more preferably about 0.01 to about 10 times, the amount of water b weight. In this case, the water containing organic solvent is used preferably in about 5 to about 500 times the amount of the sterol by weight. Although the present process can be practiced batchwise, it is desirable to practice the process cotinuously or semicontinuously, since the enzyme which is relatively expensive can then be used at least twice repeatedly. The methods wherein the enzyme is used at least twice are divided generally into two types semicontinuous methods repetition of batchwise method and continuous methods depending on whether the enzyme or immobilized enzyme is separated from the reaction mixture after the first run of contact reaction. The methods of each type are further divided as follows depending on whether the immobilized enzyme or native enzyme is used. When the process of the invention is practiced with use of the native enzyme either continuously or semicontinuously, phase separation, suitable filtration means or centrifugation is resorted to. When phase separation is utilized for practicing the present process semicontinuously, the procedure comprises adding water and or an organic solvent to the reaction mixture resulting from the first reaction to convert the mixture to a system of two phases, i.e., an aqueous phase and a hydrophobic substrate phase or allowing the mixture to stand as it is in the case of water organic solvent two phase system , separating the aqueous phase from the hydrophobic substrate phase by standing or centrifugation to separate the enzyme present in the aqueous phase and at the water solvent interface from the organic phase containing the desired ester and unreacted substrates, and repeatedly using the separated enzyme.The addition of the organic solvent to the aqueous medium system for the phase separation is effective for promoting the separation by breaking emulsification of the reaction mixture. The separated organic phase is subjected to liquid liquid extraction utilizing a distribution coefficient difference, for example, to extraction with an aqueous solution of lower alcohol such as methanol, whereby the unreacted substrate such as highly polar sterol or higher aliphatic branched alcohol material is extracted into the aqueous alcohol solution and can thereby be separated from the desired ester easily and efficiently. When the reaction system is a watercontaining organic solvent system but is not a water organic solvent two phase system, the enzyme, which is insoluble in hydrophobic substrates and organic solvents, is suspended in the reaction system in the form of particles. Accordingly, when filtration is to be resorted to in this case, the enzyme can be separated off by a suitable filtration method such as microfiltration or ultrafiltration. Microfiltration can be conducted using usual filter paper and a filter aid in combination. In this case, the enzyme is captured by the agent as adsorbed thereto and is usable in this state. A membrane filter or the like is also usable for microfiltration. Preferably the filter is about 0.02 to about 10 um in pore size.Examples of useful materials for such filters are inorganic materials having high resistance to chemicals, such as glass and metal, and organic materials such as regenerated cellulose, Teflon, polypropylene, polyamide, polyimide and like synthetic resins When the reaction system is an aqueous medium system, ultrafiltration is resorted to for separating off the enzyme for reuse. Ultrafiltration can be carried out using various ultrafilters which are usually commercially available and which are made of chemically resistant materials such as polyamide, polyimide, high polymer electrolyte composite material, etc. Further in the case of a water organic solvent two phase system, the aqueous phase can be separated from the oily or organic solvent phase by filtration utilizing the selective permeability of hydrophobic porous separation membranes. More specifically stated, hydrophobic substrates and organic solvents can penetrate through micropores of the hydrophobic separation membrane, whereas water and enzymes, which have great surface tension, are unable to wet the surface of the membrane and to pass through the micropores This makes it possible to separate the enzyme from the substrates and reaction product by filtration The hydrophobic separation membranes to be used for this method are those greater than the hydrophobic substances but smaller than water in critical surface tension, for example, those about 30 to about 55 dynes cm in critical surface tension.The pores of these membranes need not always be smaller than the enzyme particles but can be up to about 10 ijm in pore size. Examples of useful membranes are commercial microfiltration membrane filters which are made of hydrophobic Teflon and polypropylene. When the above mentioned phase separation is resorted to for practicing the process of the invention continuously, the continuous method is conducted using, for example, an native enzyme in the form of an aqueous solution or as dissolved in an aqueous solution of a hydrophilic substance usable for the aforementioned aqueous medium system when the term aqueous solution is hereinafter used for the enzyme, the term is to be interpreted as including the aqueous solution of hydrophilic substance , and employing a suitable reactor which has a reaction unit for contacting and reacting the aqueous enzyme solution with the substrates or an organic solvent solution thereof and a separation unit for effecting phase separation. Thus, the reaction and phase separation are conducted continuously to repeatedly use the aqueous enzyme solution while continuously containing the desired product from the separated organic phase. An oily phase or organic solvent phase containing the substrates is continuously fed to the reaction unit The reactor suitable for practicing the continuous method can be any of various known ones Kagaku Kogaku Chemical Engineering III, published byTokyo Ragaku Dohjin, 1964 . Typical examples of suitable reactors are the mixer settler type and the spray tower type. The reactor of the mixer settler type comprises the combination of a mixer and a settler for separating a mixture by gravity difference. To use the reactor, the substrates or an organic solvent solution thereof is continuously fed to the mixer which is filled with the aqueous enzyme solution, while the aqueous enzyme solution is contacted and reacted with the substrates or the solution thereof in the mixer with stirring at the same time. The reaction mixture is sent to the settler. While staying in the settler, the reaction mixture is separated into an aqueous phase and a substrate phase or organic solvent phase containing the desired product reaction mixture .While returning the enzyme containing aqueous phase to the mixer, the reaction mixture upper layer is drawn off from the settler. Thus, the product is continuously obtained. According to the method employing a spray tower, the aqueous enzyme solution, or the substrates or the solution thereof in a water immischhle organic solvent is caused to ascend or descend the interior of the tower as a dispersed phase for reaction. It is especially desirable to use the substrate phase as the dispersed phase since it is then unne c essay tO circulate the enzyme phase.This desirable method is practiced by placing the aqueous enzyme solution into the tower as a continuous phase, continuously supplying the substrate phase to the tower through a nozzle at a lower portion of the tower to cause the dispersed phase to rise through the liquid column of enzyme solution to effect contact therebetween and separate the phase containing a reaction product from the continuous phase at the top of the tower, and continuously ar successively drawing off the separated phase from the top. Usually, the continuous phase of aqueous enzyme solution charged into the tower need not be replaced until the activity of the enzyme decreases, while the enzyme solution can be replenished with fresh portions from time to time when the activity reduces.Since the reaction takes place at the interface between the ascending drops or substrate phase and the aqueous enzyme solution within the tower, this method assures effective contact during the initial stage of formation of drops and when the drops coalesce as generally the case with liquid liquid extraction. In this respect, it is desirable to repeat formation and extinction of drops many times. Accordingly, circulation of the substrate phase is effective for improving the synthesis ratio of the desired ester Further the reaction velocity can be improved by decreasing the size of drops, increasing the concentration of enzyme or decreasing the speed of rise of the drops to extend the contact time The spray tower method can be practiced more efficiently, for example, by using a tower having perforated plates arranged in stages at intermediate portions of the tower.The light substrate dispersed phase passes through the perforations of the plate in the first stage in the form of drops, which flow upward through the continuous phase of heavy aqueous enzyme solution while contacting and reacting therewith. The drops aggregate to form a liquid phase beneath the perforated plate in the second stage, and the liquid phase is then made into drops again upon passing through the second perforated plate upward. This procedure is repeated. Accordingly formation and extinction of drops are repeated a number of times within the tower having the perforated plates to achieve an improved efficiency. Similarly advantageously usable are a tower having a multiplicity of baffle plates in the flow channel within the tower to prolong the period of contact between the two phases, a tower packed with a suitable material in place of the perforated or baffle plates, a tower internally equipped with a rotary hollow cylindrical or disklike stirrer and adapted to effect mechanical agitation, a tower Scheibel tower having a packed material and stirring means alternately arranged in layers, a pulsating extractor for effecting agitation by pulsation instead of mechanical agitation,Podbielniak extractor, Luwesta extractor and like centrifugal extractors utilizing a centrifugal force afforded by high speed rotation. These devices can be used in combination. The process of the present invention further includes a method wherein the hydrophilic aqueous enzyme solution is placed on one side of a porous reaction membrane, and the hydrophobic substrates or the solution thereof in a water containing organic solvent is placed on the other side of the membrane to contact the enzyme solution with the substrate phase through the micropores of the membrane and to react the substrates. By this method, the desired ester can be prepared, and the enzyme is repeatedly usable without mixing the enzyme solution with the substrates. In this case, the enzyme is separated from the substrates by the membrane without mixing and is brought into contact with the substrates through the micopores of the membrane, so that the reaction mixture can be withdrawn from the system continuously while continuously supplying the substrates to the one side of the membrane. This method therefore does not permit emulsification of the reaction mixture, ingress of the enzyme protein into the substrate phase or reduction of enzymatic activity due to the substrates, further rendering the reaction free of adverse effect due to the enzyme stabilizer or the like added to the aqueous phase.Further because the reaction can be carried out at room temperature in a hermetic state, the reaction does not involve side reactions such as autoxidation of the substrates, isomerization or shift of double bond even when the substrates have low stability to oxidation. The material for the porous reaction membrane to be used for the above method is not limited specifically. Examples of useful materials are inorganic materials such as glass, ceramics, stainless steel netting and porous stainless steel, synthetic resins such as Teflon, polypropylene, polyethylene and like polyolefins, cellulose derivatives such as regenerated cellulose, nitrocellulose and acetylcellulose, and organic materials such as nylon 66 and like polyamides, polycarbonate and the like. It is suitable that the membrane have a pore size usually of about 0.05 pm to about 10 pm. Typical of such membranes are commercial membrane filters for microfiltration.Well known as such membrane filters are hydrophilic filters made of acetylcellulose, nitrocellulose, regenerated cellulose and the like, and hydrophobic filters made of Teflon, polypropylene and the like. Any of these filters usable for the present invention. As other preferred properties, it is desirable that the reaction membrane be about 10 to about 100 pm, more desirably about 20 to about 50 pm, in thickness and 20 to 80 , more desirably about 40 to about 60 , in porosity. The membrane is not specifically limited in shape and may be planar as usual. However, it is preferably hollow cylindrical, spiral, tubular or in the form of a hollow fiber. When having such a shape, the membrane permits contact between the enzyme and the substrates over a larger area than when it is planar to shorten the reaction time and achieve an improved synthesis ratio. When the reaction membrane is used for the present process, the aqueous enzyme solution comes into contact with the hydrophobic substrates through the micropores of the membrane for reaction. If the membrane is hydrophobic, the hydrophobic substratespenetrate into the enzyme solution through the micropores of the membrane. It is therefore desirable to apply pressure to the enzyme solution to avoid this objection. This pressure varies depending on the kind of membrane material. The upper limit for the pressure is usually a value permitting the water to penetrate through the micropores of the membrane against the repellency afforded by the surface tension of water thereon, i.e., water initiation value. Generally, the pressure is preferably in the range of from about 0.001 to about 20 kg cm2.When the membrane is hydrophilic, it is desirable to apply pressure of about 0.001 to about 20 kg cmê to the substrate side in order to prevent the aqueous enzyme solution from penetrating into the substrate side through the membrane micropores. The aqueous enzyme solution supplied to one side of the membrane need not be replaced or replenished usually until the activity thereof decreases, nor is it required to stir or circulate the solutionThe substrate phase supplied to the other side contacts with the enzyme for reaction through the membrane micropores. The synthesis ratio increases with an increase in the contact time. The synthesis ratio can be improved with a shortened contact time by increasing the area of contact between the enzyme and the substrates. The present invention further includes use of an immobilized lipase or cholesterol esterase for practicing the process. The immobilized enzyme can be prepared using a suitable carrier by various known methods, typical of which are, for example, entrapping method, inorganic carrier covalent bond method, organic carrier covalent bond method, adsorption method, etc.These methods will be described in detail below. The entrapping method can be practiced using various known carriers. Because the substrates to be used for the present reaction are hydrophobic, preferred carriers are those permitting the substrates to penetrate into gels easily and having a great distribution coefficient for the hydrophobic substances. Examples of such carriers are hydrophobic photo crosslinkable resin prepolymers such as ENTP represented by the formula 1 below see European J Appli. Microbiol. Biotechnol., 5, 325 1979 andUnexamined Japanese Patent Publication SHO 57 118792 , and urethane prepolymer PU represented by the formula 2 below see Biotechnol. Bioeng., 20, 1465 1469 1978 and Eur. J. Appln. Microbiol.Biotechnol., 8, 143155 1979 .EMI36.1 The hydrophobicity of these resins can be altered as desired by varying the propylene oxide content of the molecule in the case of ENTP resin, or by varying the EO PO content for PU resin. The entrapping method can be practiced with use of ENTP or like hydrophobic photo crosslinkable resin prepolymer, for example, by adding a photosensitizer to ENTP 4000 having a chain length of 40 nm, warming the mixture at about 600C to obtain a melt, cooling the molten mixture to 40C, admixing with the mixture the enzyme in a powder form or as adsorbed by a porous inorganic carrier such as celite or silica a suitable surfactant or the like can also be added in this step , spreading the resulting mixture over a transparent glass or polyester plate, covering the spread mixture with a plastic cover to eliminate air, illuminating the mixture with chemical lamps wavelength range, 300 400 nm maximum intensity at 360 nm for several minutes to effect gelation, and cutting the resulting gel film of immobilized enzyme into small pieces, whereby the desired immobilized enzyme is obtained. The entrapping method can be practiced with use of PU resins, e.g., highly hydrophobic PU 3 2529 in average molecular weight, 4.2 in NCO content, 572 in ethylene oxide content, see the above literature by heating the resin to about 50 0C to fluidize the resin, then cooling the resin to 300C, adding an aqueous enzyme solution to the resin while it is still flowable, kneading the mixture for several minutes until gelation starts, maintaining the mixture at 40C for about 60 minutes to complete gelation, cutting the gel block, thus formed to a suitable size, and washing the product with water to remove the unreacted NCO groups, whereby the desired immobilized enzyme preparation is obtained.If the reaction temperature exceeds 30 C, the enzyme could be partially inactivated, so that care should be taken to avoid the objection. Inorganic or organic carriers useful for the covalent bond method are preferably microporous carriers having a hydrophobic porous surface. Usually the pores have an average radius of about 10 A to about 1000 . Insofar as the pores give the carrier an increased enzyme bonding area per particle of the carrier, the pores may have, for example, an elongated shape such that the radius of the pores can not be determined.Examples of preferred carriers are inorganic carriers including porous glass, porous ceramics, celite, porous metallic particles such as titanium oxide, alumina, porous silica gel, molecular sieve, active carbon, clay, kaolinite, bentonite, hydroxyapatite, calcium phosphate gel and alkylamine derivatives of such materials, and organic carriers including microporous adsorbing resins such as one made basically of styrene or alkylaitiine polymer, chelate resin, ion exchange resin such a DOWEX MWA l weaky basic anion exchange resin manufactured by the DowChemical Co., having a tertiary amine as the exchange group, composed basically of polystyrene chains crosslinked with divinylbenzene, 150 in average pore radius and 20 50 mesh in particle size , and hydrophilic cellulose resin such as one prepared by masking the hydrophilic group of a cellulosic carrier, e.g., Cellulofine GC700 m 7 product of ChissoCorporation, 45 105 Vm in particle size . The covalent bond method can be practiced for immobilizing the enzyme using such inorganic carriers, for example, by preparing an alkylamine derivative of the inorganic carrier, giving enhanced hydrophobic properties to the porous surface of the carrier and immobilizing the enzyme by the glutaraldehyde method or carbodiimide method see H. H. Weetall, Methods inEnzymology, dd, 134 148 1976 J. When a hydrophobic porous resin is used as the organic carrier for the covalent bond method, the method can be practiced by causing the resin to adsorb the enzyme, followed by the glutaraldehyde method seeRev. Ferment. Ind. Aliment, 11, 237 1956 1. Stated more specifically, the covalent bond method can be practiced, for example, with use of DOWEX MWA 1, by washing the resin 1g with distilled water and 1 15 M of McIlvaine buffer pH 5.0 , adding 0.2 ml 1500 U of enzyme solution, shaking the mixture at 80C overnight for adsorption, adding 1 ml of McIlvaine buffer and 80 ul of 25 glutaraldehyde solution to the mixture, shaking the resulting mixture at 8 C for 10 minutes to bond the enzyme to the resin, adding 0.2 ml of 20 sodium bisulfite, shaking the mixture at 800C for 10 minutes to remove an excess of glutaraldehyde, and washing the resulting mixture. When a hydrophilic resin, such as CellulofineGC700 m, is used as the organic carrier, the method can be practiced by epoxidizing hydrophilic hydroxyl groups present on the surface of the resin, aminating the epoxidized resin with ethylenediamine, treating the resin with glutaraldehye to obtain aldehydized resin and reacting the resin with the enzyme in phosphate buffer. Carriers useful for the adsorption method are organic carriers prepared by modifying hydrophilic polysaccharides such as agarose gel with an alkyl, phenyl, trityl or like hydrophobic group to provide a hydrophobic porous surface, e.g., Octyl SepharoseCL 4B , Phenyl Sepharose CL 4B both products ofPharmacia Fine Chemicals and trityl agarose gel, and inorganic carriers including the same as those exemplified above in the covalent bond method. The hydrophobicity of the above mentioned organic carriers can be increased by giving an increased amount of nonpolar hydrophobic alkyl groups, or by modifying hydroxyl and like hydrophilic groups with an alkyl group or the like. With use of such organic carriers, the adsorption method can be practiced, for example, by thoroughly washing the carrier with phosphate buffer or the like and thereafter shaking the carrier and the aqueous enzyme solution together to cause the carrier to adsorb the enzyme. This method gives a high immobilizing yield as compared with the covalent bond method. Moreover, the carrier, which comprises a hydrophilic gel having hydrophobic ligands attached thereto, retains and affords a sufficient amount of water needed for the enzyme to exhibit its activity.The carrier is further given enhanced affinity for the hydrophobic substrate by the modification of hydrophobic group. Accordingly, the immobilized enzyme prepared by the method is especially suited to the present process. When an inorganic carrier is used for the adsorption method, the method can be practiced merely by shaking the carrier and the aqueous enzyme solution together. This method is most convenient and inexpensive, less likely to lower the activity of the enzyme when immobilizing, and physically and chemically stable. When the process of the present invention is to be practiced batchwise or semicontinuously using the enzyme immobilized by one of the foregoing methods, the immobilized enzyme and the substrates are placed, for example, into a suitable reactor to react the substrates in contact with the enzyme in an aqueous medium system and or water containing organic solvent system. In the case of semicontinuous method, the immobilized enzyme is separated from the resulting reaction mixture in usual manner, for example, by filtration or centrifugation and is used repeatedly for the subsequent reaction cycle. The reaction can be carried out under suitable conditions that will not destroy the immobilized enzyme, e.g. with shaking or passing the substrate solution through the enzyme for contact.The desired ester can be collected from the reaction mixture separated from the immobilized enzyme, in the same manner as in the foregoing methods employing phase separation technique. The present process can be practiced continuously with use of the immobilized enzyme, for example, by packing the enzyme in a suitable column, continuously passing the substrates or a water containing organic solvent solution thereof though the column for contact and reaction, continuously collecting the reaction mixture and separating the desired ester from the reaction mixture.Irrespective of whether the semicontinuous method or continuous method is resorted to, the immobilized enzyme can be recovered easily. This eliminates the need to remove the enzyme protein in the step of purifying the desired ester and assures reuse of the recovered enzyme, hence advantageous. Additionally, the continuous method involves a reduced likelihood of permitting exposure of the substrates to air during reaction and therefore has the advantage that unsaturated fatty acids or the like, if used, will not be oxidized with air. The desired ester obtained by the present process is separated from the reaction mixture by a usual method and, when required, is purified. In the case of batchwise method, the desired product can be separated from the reaction mixture, for example, by subjecting the mixture to extraction using a suitable solvent such as ether, removing the unreacted fatty acid material with an alkali, dehydrating and drying the solvent layer, and removing the solvent from the layer. The desired product can be purified, for example, by column chromatography. The desired ester thus obtained is usable for a wide variety of applications for which esters of the same type are usually used. Examples The examples to be given below are further illustrative of the present invention. It should be understood that the amounts of enzymes indicated in the examples are the international units determined by the following methods.lipase activity To 75 ml of polyvinyl alcohol solution tl8 g of Poval 9117 Kurashiki Rayon Co., Ltd. and 2 g ofPoval 205 the same manufacturer as above are suspended in 800 ml of water, stirred at 75 800C to complete dissolution, cooled and water is added to make a total of 1,000 ml is added 22.9 g of olive oil and the mixture is emulsified with a homogenizer. To 5 ml of the emulsion thus obtained is added 4 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer, followed by addition of 1 ml of an enzyme solution. The mixture is stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 500 rpm at 370C for 20 minutes.After 40 ml of ethyl alcohol is added, the free fatty acid is titrated with 0.05 M potassium hydroxide. The amount of the enzyme which liberates 1 mole equivalent of fatty acid in 1 minute under the above conditions is taken as one international unit U . Cholesterol esterase activity One unit 1 U of cholesterol esterase is the activity which liberates 1 mole of cholesterol from calf serum in 1 minute at 37 C. It is determined by oxidizing the free cholesterol with cholesterol oxidase using the following reagent and enzyme solutions and estimating the product hydrogen peroxide colorimetrical ly using peroxidase.Reactant composition 0.2 M phosphate buffer pH 6.5 0.6 ml 4 Peroxidase Sigma Chemical, Type II No. P 8250 0.3 ml 4 Aminoantipyrin 0.35t aqueous solution 0.3 ml Phenol 0.2 wjw aqueous solution 0.3 ml Cholesterol oxidase prepared by diluting Product No.T 04 Toyo Jozo Co. , with 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0, contain ing 0.05 w v 8 Triton X 100 to 10 U mlJ 0.6 ml Calf serum Grand Island Biological, U.S.A. 0.3 ml Distilled water 0.3 ml The sample enzyme solution is prepared by dissolving the enzyme in 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.5, containing 0.1t of albumin to make a concentration of about 1 U ml.A 3 ml portion of.the above reactant composition is placed in a cell for colorimetry and incubated at 370C for 10 minutes, then 0.05 ml of the sample enzyme solution is added, mixing is effected by gently turning the cell upside down, and the absorbance is measured at 493 nm at timed intervals to thereby determine the rate of increase in absorbance As min . Using the buffer for dilution in place of the sample enzyme solution, the same procedure is performed and the rate of increase dAb min is determined. If the difference between the above rates of increase in absorbance EA min AAs EAb is below 0.05, the concentration of the sample enzyme solution is increased and the procedure is repeated until said difference amounts to 0,05 or more.The enzyme activity is calculated as follows Enzyme activity U mg hA min x 3.05 x 1 12.0 x 0.5 x 0.05 enzyme concentration mg ml The synthesis ratio of the desired ester is determined in the following manner. Thus, in Examples 1 14, the reaction mixture is acidified and extracted four times with diethyl e ther, the extract is washed with water and dehydrated and dried, then the diethyl ether is distilled off and, to the whole lipid thus obtained, a known quantity of an internal standard n dotriacontane is added to give a sample for quantitative determination.This sample is charged onto a Chromarod quartz rod with silica gel fused thereto product of latron Chromarod S II , developed and submitted to an Iatroscan TH 10 Iatron s FID hydrogen flame ionization detector , The thusdetermined quantity of the ester synthesized is divided by the theoretical quantity of the ester as calculated based on the quantity of the charge to give the synthesis ratio in percentage.In Examples 15 65, the reaction mixture is converted to a water organic solvent two phase system, the organic solvent phase is separated and, after adjustment to an appropriate concentration, charged onto the above mentioned Chromarod in an amount corresponding to 10 30 pg of lipid, and developed under appropriate conditions causing separation of the desired ester from the unreacted substrates e.g hexane ether formic acid 56 14 0.3 . If necessary, a silver nitrate impregnatedChromarod, for instance, is used for the separation of components. After development, the Chromarod is dried for several minutes and submitted, in the developing solvent free state, to Iatroscan TH 10 to thereby determine the peak area for the lipid component in the reaction mixture.The synthesis ratio of the desired ester is calculated based on the above area using the equation given in the corresponding example. In each of the examples, unless otherwise specified, the reaction was carried out in a constanttemperature room maintained at 370C, stirring of the reaction mixture was effected with a reciprocating shaker 20 mm x 300 cpm Iwashiya Bio Science Co.,Ltd., model RMR S 20 and the organic solvents were used as saturated with water. In Examples 1 8, the enzyme used was Candida cylindracea derived lipase Lipase MY t product ofMeito Sangyo Co., Ltd. . The enzymes used in other examples are given in the respective examples. Example 1 In this example, the correlation between the rate of ester synthesis synthesis ratio and the quantitative ratio between the substrates was investigated by conducting the reaction in several runs in which 100 mg of cholesterol and a varying amount of oleic acid were used as the sterol and fatty acid, respectively, and brought into contact with each other in the presence of 0.5 ml 500 U of an aqueous solution of lipase with stirring for 18 hours. The results thus obtained are shown below in Table 1. Table 1 Run No. Oleic acid amount mug Synthesis ratio 1 70 58.5 2 100 77.9 3 150 83.0 4 220 87.7 5 290 88.6 6 370 89.7 7 440 91.8 8 660 92.0 The data in Table 1 indicate that when oleic acid is used about 1 6 times the amount by weight of cholesterol, the desired ester, cholesteryl oleate, can be synthesized in a ratio of not less than about 80 .It is further indicated that when oleic acid is used in an amount of 2 6 weight parts 3 9 moles per weight part mole of cholesterol, the esterification is rapid and the synthesis ratio of the desired ester is maximum. Example 2 In this example, what influences the water content in the reaction system has on the synthesis ratio of the desired ester was examined. Thus, the reaction was carried out using 100 mg of cholesterol, 220 mg of oleic acid and 0.5 ml 500 U of an aqueous lipase solution under the same conditions as used inExample I except that 0.5 ml, 1.0 ml, 2.0 ml, 4.0 ml, 6.0 ml or 10.0 ml of water was added to the system.The synthesis ratio attained in the respective runs after 18 hours are shown below in Table 2. Table 2 Run No. Amount of water ml Synthesis ratio 1 0 87.5 2 0.5 97.6 3 1.0 97.4 4 2.0 98.2 5 4.0 97.4 6 6.0 96.9 7 10.0 92.7 The data in Table 2 indicate that water should preferably be used in an amount of about 1 3 ml about 10 30 weight parts per weight part of cholesterol . Example 3 In this example, the reaction was conducted in water containing organic solvent systems. Thus, the reaction was carri.ed out using 100 mg of cholesterol, 220 mg of oleic acid, 0.5 ml 500 U of an aqueous solution of lipase and a varying amount of isooctane, n octane or n hexane, each saturated with water, with stirring for 18 hours. The synthesis ratio of the ester as attained in this manner are shown below inTable 3. Table 3Run No. Solvent ml Synthesis ratio 1 Water without 87.5 organic solvent 2 Isooctane 1 96.2 3 2 96.7 4 4 91.4 5 6 83,4 6 n 8 78.8 7 10 67.6 8 n Octane 1 83.5 9 2 78.1 10 4 29.8 11 It 6 13.9 12 8 8.5 13 10 7.7 14 n Hexane 1 76.4 15 n 2 68.8 16 4 29.6 17 n 6 11.0 18 n 8 9.5 19 n 10 6.6 The data in Table 3 indicate that the isooctane involving systems are least in enzyme inactivation among the above systems. Isooctane, when added in an amount of 0.5 3 ml, markedly increased the synthesis ratio of the ester. Example 4 In this example, the reaction was carried out for 18 hours in the water isooctane system by adding 2.0 ml of isooctane to a mixture of 100 mg of cholesterol, 220 mg of oleic acid and 0.5 ml 500 U of an aqueous solution of lipase with a varying amount of water further added thereto. The thus obtained synthesis ratio of the desired ester are shown below inTable 4.

Example 6 In this example, the fatty acid was a solid one and the reaction in water organic solvent and the reaction in water were compared. The reaction was carried out using 100 mg of cholesterol, 220 mg of a solid fatty acid and 0.5 ml 500 U of an aqueous lipase solution with stirring for 18 hours. For performing the reaction in water organic solvent twophase system, 2.0 ml of n octane and 7.5 ml of water were further added to the reaction system whereas, for conducting the reaction in aqueous medium system, 2.0 ml of water was added to the reaction system. Palmitic acid and stearic acid were used each as the solid fatty acid. The results thus obtained are shown in Table 6 For comparison, the data obtained by using oleic acid, which is liquid at ordinary temperatures, are also given in Table 6.

Example 7 In this example, 0.5 ml of a lipase solution having a varying concentration was added to the reaction system consisting of 100 mg of cholesterol, 220 m of Qleic acid, 2.0 ml of n octane and 8.0 ml of water, and the correlationship between the enzyme concentration and the synthesis ratio of the ester was investigated.The reaction were conducted with stirring for 18 hours.The results thus obtained are shown in Fig. 1. In Fig.1, the synthesis ratio of the ester is on the ordinate and the enzyme amount in international units,U on the abscissa, the ratios of the ester as obtained by using the enzyme in varied amounts given in U being plotted against said enzyme amounts. The data in Fig. 1 indicate that when about 5,000 U of the enzyme is used per 1000 mg of cholesterol, the reaction can proceed rapidly and give the desired ester in high ratios. Example 8 In this example, lipase was used in that amount about 100 U found in Example 7 to give a synthesis ratio of about 30 40 at the end of 18 hours of reaction, and the enzymatic reaction period was further extended. In this way, the correlation between the reaction period and the ratio of the ester was studied. The results thus obtained are shown below inTable 7.

Example 9 In this example, each combination of a sterol in an amount of 100 mg , a fatty acid and an enzyme in an amount of 0.5 ml solution as given in. Table 8 was used and the reaction was carried out in each reaction systems given in Table 8 with stirring for 18 hours to give the corresponding desired ester.

Thereafter, ether was added and the mixture was washed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate to remove the aqueous layer, After several repetitions of this procedure, the ether layer was dried on anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether was then distilled off to give cholesteryl oleate, which was a white semitransparent crude product, in 96.38 purity and in a yield of 16.Q g 95.08 , The thus obtained crude product 6 g was charged into a silica gel column Wakogel C200, 160 g, product of Wako Pure Chemical Industries and eluted with 2,000 ml of benzene to give 5.3 g of cholesteryl oleate. The infrared absorption spectrum IR , melting point, color development on a thin layer chromatography TLC plate and Rf value of this product were in complete agreement with those of reference standard cholesteryl oleate. Example 14 The reaction was effected for 45 hours by stirring a mixture of 1 g of cholesterol, 2.2 g of isostearic acid product of Emery Industries , 0.333 g 10,0Q0 U of lipase MY, 30 ml of isooctane and 80 ml of 0.05 M phosphate buffer at 200 rpm. In the course of the reaction, the reaction mixture was sampled at timed intervals for determination of the synthesis ratio of the desired ester. The ratio was 28.5 in 3 hours, 85.9 in 23 hours and 91.0 in 45 hours. The reaction was discontinued at 45 hours after starting the reaction, followed by extraction with aqueous methanol to remove the unreacted substrate. Distillation of the isooctane layer gave 1.53 g of unreacted isostearic acid and 1.54 g of the desired isostearic acid ester. The thus obtained cholesterol isostearic acid ester gave one single spot on a TLC plate and found to be 100 pure by latroscan analysis. Example 15 A mixture of 100 mg of cholesterol, 220 mg of oleic acid, 8 ml of isooctance, 8 ml of water and 500 U of lipase MY was stirred for 3 hours. Then, a sample was taken from the upper layer and analyzed for the synthesis ratio of cholesteryl oleate. Said ratio was calculated as follows Synthesis x 100 I ratio The above term 11first component means that one of the two substrates charged as the reaction substrates which is smaller in the number of moles.For instance, if the fatty acid was charged in an amount of 3 moles per mole of the alcohol, the alcohol is the first component. According to the above equation, the ratio becomes 100 when the component charged in a smaller amount in terms of the number of moles has disappeared from the reaction mixture, independently of the remainder of the other component charged in excess. In the description that follows, the synthesis ratio data, unless otherwise specifically stated, are data calculated according to the above equation I . Thereafter, the reaction mixture was allowed to stand. The resulting upper isooctane layer was removed while leaving the interface portion in contact with water. To the remainder was added 5 ml of isooctane, the mixture was stirred and allowed to stand and the isooctane layer was removed, followed by the elimination of the unreacted substrates remaining in the interfa ce portion and the reaction product by washing. After 5 repetitions of this procedure, 100 mg of cholesterol, 220 mg of oleic acid and 8 ml of isooctane were again added to the enzyme containing aqueous layer, and the reaction was carried out for 3 hours. The invention was practiced repeating the above procedure comprising treating the mixture for effecting the reaction , removing the upper, substrateand reaction product containing isooctane layer while leaving the lipase containing aqueous layer and the interface layer, and adding the substrates and isooctane newly for the next reaction run. The results thus obtained are shown in Fig.2. In Fig. 2, the synthesis ratio of the ester is on the ordinate and the time hrs after start of the reaction in the first run zero hour is on the abscissa, the ester synthesis ratio in each run as attained by allowing the newly charged substrates to react with each other for 3 hours being plotted against the time at which the substrate substitution was conducted. During the period from the determination of the ratio to substrate substitution, the reaction mixture was allowed to stand while the enzyme and substrates were in contact with one another. Fig. 2 indicates that the ester synthesis ratio after 130 hours is still not less than 90 and accordingly that the enzyme does not loss its activity at all at least in iXs repeatad use in 14.. reaction runs or about 43.times if it is supposed that the reaction run is repeated in 3 hour cycles . Example 16 The procedure of Example 15 was followed except that the reaction mixture was composed of 10Q mg of cholesterol, 220 mg of oleic acid, 2 ml of isooctane, 8 ml of water and 500 U 16.7 mg of lipaseMY. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 3 in the same manner as in Fig. 2. From Fig. 3, it is seen that at least 94 synthesis ratio can be secured in each repeated 3 hour reaction run until about 130 hours, namely the synthesis reaction can be repeated about 28 times, without enzyme losses due to substitution of the organic solvent phase. Example 17 A mixture of 100 mg of cholesterol and 220 mg of oleic acid was treated for 18 hours with 0.5 ml of an aqueous solution of 500 U of lipase MY with water added to the system in an amount of 0.5 10.0 ml. After reaction, 10 ml of isooctane was added to the reaction mixture and the resulting mixture was allowed to stand. The upper isooctane layer, except the interface portion, was removed, 100 mg of cholesterol and 220 mg of oleic acid were newly added to the lower enzyme solution layer, and the reaction was conducted for 18 hours. The above procedure was repeated three times in all. The results obtained are given below in Table 12. Table 12Run No. Amount of Synthesis ratio water added 1st 2nd 3rd ml reaction reaction reaction 1 0 87.5 86.8 87.0 2 0.5 97.6 97.3 97.4 3 1.0 97.4 97.4 97.3 2.0 98.2 98.0 97.9 5 4.0 97.4 97.0 96.8 6 6.0 96.9 96.8 96.9 7 10.0 92.7 92.0 92.0 In this example, the reaction was carried out in an aqueous system, then the system was converted to a water isooctane system and, after separation of the enzyme, this was re used in an aqueous system.The data shown above in Table 12 clearly indicate that even when the amount of water in the reaction system is large, the equilibrium of reaction shifts in the direction toward synthesis, that the enzyme can be separated with ease by converting the system to a water organic solvent two phase system after reaction, and further that the thus separated enzyme can be used repeatedly without losses in its activity. The above results also indicate that even when cholesterol remains partly undissolved in the system, the synthesis reaction can proceed to a satisfactory extent. Example 18 The reaction was carried out in a reaction system composed of 100 mg of cholesterol, 220 mg of one of various fatty acids, 500 U of lipase MY and 10 ml of isboctane. Thereafter, 3 ml of water was added and the mixture was stirred, followed by phase separation as a water isooctane two phase system. The isooctane layer, except the interface portion, was removed, a substrate solution composed of 100 mg of cholesterol, 220 mg of the fatty acid and 10 ml of isooctane was added newly to the remaining aqueous enzyme solution and the reaction was conducted for 18 hours. The above procedure was repeated three times in all. The results obtained are shown below in Table 13.

Example 19 The reaction mixture as obtained in Example 18 after the first reacti on was filtered, without addition of 3 ml of water, through a 0.45 jim Teflon membrane filter. The lipase MY used powder remained undissolved, adhering to the reaction vessel wall or forming blocks, but could be recovered by washing of the reaction vessel with two l0 ml portions of isooctane, followed by filtration. The enzyme recovered, together with the membrane filter, was transferred to the same reaction vessel, the same substrate solution as used in Example 18 was added, and the reaction was again conducted for 18 hours This procedure was repeated three times.The results obtained are shown below in Table 14. Table 14Run No. Fatty acid Synthesis ratio 1st 2nd 3rd reaction reaction reaction 1 B l 98.9 98.5 98.3 2 B 2 99.0 98.7 98.9 3 B 3 98.5 97.8 8.0 In this example, the enzyme was separated by using a membrane filter and re used. The data in Table 14 indicate that the enzyme in a dispersed state can be recovered for reuse by filtration. Example 20 To a substrate solution composed of 100 mg of cholesterol, 220 mg of o1eic acid and 10 ml of isooctane was added 500 U 16.7 mg of lipase MY in powder form, and the reaction was conducted for 18 hours. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 minutes to thereby cause the suspended enzyme particles to precipitate. The supernatant was removed by decantation, the enzyme particles were returned to the same reaction vessel as before and, after addition of a new portion of the substrate solution, the synthesis reaction was repeated. The above synthesis reaction procedure was repeated three times in all. The synthesis ratio was 98.5 in the first reaction, 97.3 in the second and 96.8 in the third. This example, in which the synthesis reaction was conducted in a water containing organic solvent system and the enzyme was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and re used, shows that the enzyme suspended in the reaction system can be recovered for reuse by centrifugation. Example 21 To a substrate solution composed of 100 mg of cholesterol, 200 mg of a hydroxypalmitic acid and 2 ml of isooctane was added an aqueous solution of 1,000 U 33.3 mg of lipase MY in 8 ml of water, and the reaction was carried out for 72 hours. After reaction, the emulsified upper 1ayertion of the reaction mixture was filtered portionwise using a polypropylenemade hydrophobic porous membrane Duraguard 2400 porosity 38 , maximum pore size 0.02 x 0.2 umr critical surface tension 35 dyne cm, product of PolyplasticsCo. .The aqueous enzyme solution could not wet the surface of said membrane because of its higher surface tension than the critical surface tension of the above membrane and accordingly could nbt pass through the micropores occurring on the membrane surface whereas isooctane permeated the micropores. The nonpermeating aqueous enzyme solution was returned to the reaction vessel and, after newly adding thereto the same substrate solution as above, the reaction was conducted again for 72 hours. The synthesis ratio in the above mentioned first reaction was 73.2 and that in the second reaction was 69.5e. This example, in which the reaction was conducted in a water organic solvent two phase system and the reaction mixture was filtered using a hydrophobic porous membrane for selective permeation of the organic solvent, shows that the aqueous enzyme solution can be separated from the somewhat emulsified reaction mixtures well by utilizing the surface tension based selective permeability of the membrane. Example 22 Using an alcohol component used in an amount of 100 mg given in Table 15 together with a fatty acid and an enzyme each given in the same table each in a specified amount and employing the reaction system and reaction time given in said table, the reaction was performed, and the aqueous enzyme solution was separated from the organic solvent phase containing the desired ester and unreacted substrates in the same manner as in Example 15. In this manner, the synthesis reaction was repeated using the enzyme repeatedly. The results obtained are also shown in Table 15. In the table, PB means 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 .

Example 23 Using an apparatus for continuous reaction comprising a glass column G , 2 cm in inside diameter and 2 m in length, a pump P1 and a receptacle To , as shown by the flowchart given in Fig. 4, a portion G2 of the column was filled with 600 ml of an aqueous solution of lipase MY in 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 having an enzyme concentration of 125 U ml, and a substrate solution composed of 2,500 mg of cholesterol, 2,500 mg of oleic acid and 250 ml of isooctane was introduced into the aqueous enzyme solution layer portion G2 at a flow rate of 9.5 ml min by means of the pump P1 in the form of small oily droplets through a nozzle N1 disposed at the bottom of the column G . The small droplets introduced rose through the aqueous enzyme solution layer to the force of injection and the bouyancy while undergoing the reaction and separated as an isooctane layer containing the reaction product at an upper portion Gl of the glass column. This isooctane layer was allowed to overflow through a nozzle N2 and again fed to the aqueous enzyme solution layer G2 through the receptacle T1 by means of the pump P1 . In this manner, the reaction was conducted while recycling the substrate solution through the aqueous enzyme solution repeatedly. The changes of the ester synthesis ratio with time as measured are shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5, the synthesis ratio is on the ordinate and the circulation time hrs on the abscissa, the ratios as determined for samples taken from the reaction mixture flowing into the receptacle T1 at timed intervals being plotted against the corresponding circulation times. Fig. 5 shows that the ratio reaches 95 , or an almost equilibrium state, in about 4 hours. It is also indicated that since the rate of feeding to the column is 9.5 ml min, it takes about 26.3 minutes for the whole 250 ml substrate solution to contact once with the aqueous enzyme solution and that about 9 times of circulation drives the reaction to an equilibrium.The number of times of circulation naturally varies depending on such factors as the manner of formation and extinction of droplets and the retention time and said number can be varied by using column packings, baffle plates, stirring, etc. Example 24 Using a continuous reaction vessel comprising glass column G , 2 cm in inside diameter and 2 m in length, pumps P1, P2, P3 , a distributor B , autosampler A , receptacle T1 , mixing vessel T2 , raw material tank T3 , reaction mixture tank T4 and reaction terminator containing test tube T5 , as shown by the flowchart in Fig. 6, a portion G2 of the column was filled with 600 ml of a solution of lipaseMY in phosphate buffer pH 7,0 having an enzyme concentration of 125 U ml, and a substrate solution composed of 2,000 mg of cholesterol, 3,000 mg of oleic acid and 600 ml of isooctane was introduced into the aqueous enzyme solution layer portion G2 in the form of small oily droplets through a nozzle Nl disposed at the bottom of the column at a rate of 15 5 ml min by means o of the pump P1 . The small droplets introduced flew up through the aqueous enzyme solution layer to the force of injection and the bouyancy while undergoing thea reaction to form an isooctane layer contyining the reaction product at an upper portion G1 of the glass column. This isooctane layer was allowed to overflow through a nozzle N2 and retained in the receptacle T1 temporarily and partly withdrawn continuously into the reaction mixture tank T4 via the distributor B at a rate of 0.25 ml min by means of the pump P2 . The remaining portion of the isooctance solution as overflowing from the receptacle T1 was introduced into the mixing tank T2 and mixed therewith a new substrate solution portion having the same composition as above and supplied from the raw material tank T3 at a rate of 0.25 ml min by means of the pump P3 . The resulting mixed substrate solution was again fed to the G2 portion of the glass column through the nozzle N1 at a rate of 15.5 ml min by means of the pump P1 . The autosampler A sampled the reaction mixture from the distributor B at 3 hour intervals and transferred the samples to the test tube T5 containing a reaction terminator solution acetone ethanol 1 1 . In this manner, the reaction was effected by recycling the substrate solution through the aqueous enzyme solution repeatedly while the reaction mixture was sampled at 3 hour intervals by means of the autosampler CA and assayed for the ester synthesis ratio. The thus obtained data are shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7, the synthesis ratio is on the ordinate and the time hrs from the start of reaction zero hour is on the abscissa, the ratio being plotted against the time. During the period from the start of reaction to about 2 hours after that, the isooctane layer in the upper part G1 of the column was in an emulsified state but began to show phase separation with the progress of reaction and the separation was complete at about 5 hours. Fig. 7 shows that when a water organic solvent system is used as the reaction system, emulsification does not occur even in a simple spray column such as the one shown in Fig. 6 but that the desired ester can be synthesized continuously using the enzyme repeatedly without exchange or supplementation of the enzyme for 150 hours or longer, while the synthesis ratio can be maintained at 95 or more. Example 25 A vessel was divided into two compartments, an upper and a lower, by means of a polypropylene made hydrophobic membrane Duraguard 25001 , product of Polyplastics Co., thickness 25 urn, average pore size 0.1 pm, maximum pore size 0.04 x 0.4 um, porosity 45 , effective surface area membrane area minus area required for fitting the vessel with the membrane 9.6 cm J. The lower compartment 50 cm in capacity was filled with 50 cm3 of an aqueous solution of lipase MY having an enzyme concentration of 62.5 U ml.A communicating tube connected to said compartment was also filled with the same aqueous enzyme solution so that the liquid level was higher by 20 cm than the membrane level. The upper compartment of the above vessel was charged with a substrate solution composed of 20 mg of cholesterol, 44 mg of oleic acid and 10 ml of isooctane.The whole vessel was shaken on a skaker at a stroke of 6 cm and a frequency of 120 cpm to thereby effect the reaction. The synthesis ratio after 18 hours of reaction was 94.6 . The reaction system was not emulsified. No penetration of water into the substrate phase was observed. When the reaction is effected in the above manner by contacting the enzyme and substrates with one another through a porous reaction membrane, the aqueous enzyme solution, which has a high surface tension, cannot wet the hydrophobic membrane nor pass through micropores of said membrane, hence is not mixed with the hydrophobic substrates in the substrate solution.On the contrary, the hydrophobic substrates penetrate micropores of the hydrophobic membrane and come into contact with that portion of enzyme which is absorbed on said hydrophobic interface on the lower side of the membrane. In this case, an increase in the frequency of contact among the enzyme and substrates results in a shortened reaction time. Therefore, the use of a crepe, spiral, tubular, hollow fiber or like appropriate type in lieu of the fla L membrane type such as mentioned above serves to further reduce the reaction time. Example 26 A membrane Duraguard 3501IT product of the same company as above, the thickness, pore size and porosity being the same as above which is hydrophilic as a result of surface treatment was used in place of the Duraguard 2500 used in Example 25. The upper and lower compartments divided by said membrane were charged respectively with the same substrate solution and enzyme solution as above. The liquid level in the communicating tube was the same as the membrane level. The reaction was conducted for 18 hours in the same manner as in Example 25. The reaction system was not emulsified, and the synthesis ratio was 92.0 , When a hydrophilic membrane is used as in this example, the aqueous enzyme solution permeates micropores of the membrane and contacts with the substrates in the upper part of the membrane and catalyzes the reaction there. Example 27 The procedure of Example 25 was followed using 4 kinds of membrane as shown in Table 16. The volume of the lower compartment was 4 cm3 and other reaction conditions were the same as in Example 25.The results obtained are also shown in Table 16.

ExamPle 28 The same membrane as used in Example 25 was used except that the effective membrane area was 102 cm2 . The lower, compartment had a capacity of 82 cm3 and was filled with an aqueous solution of lipaseMY having a concentration of 62.5 U ml. The liquid level in the communicating tube was 41 cm higher than the membrane level. The upper compartment was charged with a substrate solution composed of 400 mg of chQlesterol, 880 mg of oleic acid and 40 ml of isooctane. A magnetic stirrer was placed on said membrane and revolved to thereby stir the substrate phase. The whole vessel was placed in a constanttemperature room and the reaction was performed for 24 hours. The results obtained are shown below in Table 17.

Example 29 The same membrane as used in Example 25 was used except that the effective membrane area was 10.3 cm2 . The lower compartment had a capacity of 4.1 cm3 and was filled with an aqueous lipase MY solution in a varying concentration. The liquid level in the communicating tube was set at a level 41 cm higher than the membrane level, and the reaction was conducted in the same manner. The synthesis ratio data after 3 hours are shown below in Table 18.

Example 30 Using an aqueous lipase MY solution 600U ml and a substrate solution in which an alcohol component 100 mg specified in Table 19 was combined with a fatty acid and an organic solvent each given inTable 19, the reaction was carried out in an appropriate reaction vessel with Duraguard 2500 used therein.

Example 31 In the first place, lipase MY was immobilized by mixing a resin for immobilization in the manner mentioned below in 1 or 2 . 1 One gram of ENTP 4000 product of Kansai PaintCo., Ltd. was mixed with 10 mg of benzoin ethyl ether and 40 mg of sorbitan monooleate. The mixture was melted completely by warming at 600C with stirring and then cooled to 4 C, 2,000 U of the enzyme in the powder form was added thereto, the resulting mixture was well kneaded, then diluted with 2 ml of isooctane and spread in the sheet form, 7 cm x 10 cm x 0,5 mm in size, and the sheet was covered with a transparent polyester film and gelled by illumination a Toshiba chemical lamp used 3 minutes . After gelation, the resin was cut to square pieces, 4 5 mm in side length and used as an immobilized enzyme preparation. 2 The above procedure 1 was followed using benzeneheptane 1 1 in place of isooctane while omitting the use of sorbitan monooleate. To each of the immobilized enzymes obtained above in 1 and 2 was added a substrate solution composed of 100 mg of cholesterol, 220 mg of oleic acid and 15 ml of isooctane with 3 ml of 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH7.0 thereto, and the reaction was conducted for 3 hours. After reaction, the reaction mixture was filtered. To the immobilized enzyme thus recovered, there was newly added the same substrate solution as used above, and the reaction was carried out again. The above reaction procedure was repeated five times in all. The results obtained are shown below in Table 20. Table 20Run No. Immobilized Synthesis ratio method 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 1 1 97.7 94.8 96.5 95.4 96.8 2 2 2 96.5 97.0 96.3 94.8 95.4 Example 32 1,000 U of lipase MY was mixed in advance with 100 mg of Celite and 0.1 ml of water to thereby cause adsorption of the enzyme on Celite. Thereafter,, the mixture was made into an immobilized enzyme preparation by following the procedure 2 of Example 31. The reaction was carried out for 4 hours using the above immobi7ized enzyme preparation and a reaction mixture composed of a substrate solution of 100 mg of cholesterol and 220 mg of oleic acid in 5 ml of isooctane, 10 ml of isooctane and 3 ml of 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 and the synthesis ratio was determined. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was filtered and the immobilized enzyme thus separated was submitted to the same reaction again as an immobilized enzyme. The above reaction procedure was repeated tree times a day. On the third run, the synthesis ratio alone was determined while the reaction mixture was allowed to stand without filtration, with the immobilized enzyme and substrates coexisting in the system together with the product ester. Said mixture was filtered on the next day and subjected to new repetitions of the reaction procedure. In this manner, the reaction was continued for 10 days. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 8. Tn Fig, 8, the ester synthesis ratio is on the ordinate and the time after preparation of the immobilized enzyme on the abscissa, the ratio after 4 hours of reaction following the substrate replacement being plotted against the time. It is evident from said figure that when an immobilized enzyme is used, the enzyme activity can be retained for at least 10 days and the reaction can be repeated accordingly. Example 33 An immobilized enzyme preparation was prepared from 2,000 U 19.0 mg of cholesterol esteraseT 18 product of Toyo Jozo by the procedure 2 ofExample 31. To the immobilized enzyme preparation were added 100 mg of cholesterol, 220 mg of oleic acid and 15 ml of isdoctane, and the reaction was carried out for 1 hour. After reaction, the reaction mixture was filtered and the thus recovered immobilized enzyme was used for the next run in the same reaction system as in the first run. In this manner, the reaction was repeated 36 times in all over 12 days. The synthesis ratio in the 36th run was 93.5 . Thereafter, the reaction mixture was filtered once a day except holidays and, using the recovered immobilized emzyme, the same reaction was repeated for further 120 days in the same reaction system while replacing the substrate solution with a new one each day. A synthesis ratio of 95.0 was obtained 5 hours after the start of reaction on the final day. Example 34 Using the procedure of Example 32, 2,000 U 7.1 mg of Chromobacterium viscosum derived lipase Lipase T 01 , product of Toyo Jozo was made up into an immobilized enzyme preparation. To the immobilized enzyme preparation were added a substrate solution composed of 100 mg of cholesterol, 220 mg of oleic acid and 15 ml of isooctane and 3 ml of 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 , and the reaction was effected for 48 hours. After reaction, the reaction mixture was filtered and the immobilized enzyme thus recovered was used for the next reaction run in the same system as in the first run. The reaction was repeated three times in this manner. The synthesis ratio in the third run was 87.82. Example 35 An obilized enzyme preparation was prepared by immobilizing lipase MY on ENTP 4000 in a proportion of 2,000 U of enzyme per gram of resin by the procedure I of Example 31. The reaction was carried out using a specified amount of the above immobilized enzyme preparation and a combination of an alcohol component, fatty acid and organic solvent each specified in Table 21. After reaction, the reaction mixture was filtered and the immobilized enzyme thus recovered was repeatedly used for the reaction, which was carried out in the same reaction system as in the first reaction. The results obtained are shown in Table 21. In Table 21, the indication Note 1 for the reaction system means that said reaction system was a system in which the solvent system was composed of 15 ml of isooctane and 3 ml of 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 .

After immersion, the Celite was washed with 400 ml of acetone and filtered to give silanated Celite. Said silanated Celite 20 g was immersed in a 1 aqueous solution of glutaraldehyde.and, after overnight reaction at 40C, washed well with 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7,0 , followed by filtration, which gave aldehydo Celite. To 1 g of said aldehydo Celite were added 1,500 U of the enzyme and 2 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer, and immobilization was effected at 40C overnight, followed by filtration, which gave a glutaraldehydo Celite immobilized enzyme. Separately, 1,500 U of the enzyme, 5 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 and 50 mg of a carbodiimide reagent l cyclohexyl 3 morpholinoethyl carbodiimide metho p toluenesulfonate were added to 1 g of the above silanated Celite. Washing with water and filtration after overnight reaction at 40C gave a carbodiimido Celite immobilized enzyme. Furthermore, a porous glass CPG00500, average micropore size 257.5 A, particle size 120 200 mesh, product of Electronucleonics was used in lieu orCelite in the above procedures, which were performed in the same manner to give a glutaraldehydo glassimmobilized enzyme and a carbodiimido glass immobilized enzyme. The enzyme used was lipase MY. To each of the immobilized enzyme preparations prepared in the above, there were added 100 mg of cholesterol, 220 mg of oleic acid, 2 ml of isooctane and 8 ml of 0.05 M phosphate buffer, and the reaction was carried out for 18 hours. After reaction, the reaction mixture was filtered, the immobilized enzyme recovered as a cake was returned to the reaction vessel together with the filter paper r and the reaction was repeated again in the above reaction system. This reaction procedure was repeated three times in all.The synthesis ratio obtained in the third reaction is shown below in Table 22.

Using the four immobilized enzyme preparations, the reaction was carried out in the same reaction system for 48 hours. As a result, synthesis ratio of 92.4 , 88.9 , 94.58 and 92.4 were obtained, respectively. Example 38 To 75 g of wet Cellulofine GC 700 m product of Chisso Corp. as obtained after washing with water and filtration, there were added 21.6 ml of 1 N aqueous sodium hydroxide and 12 ml of epichlorohydrin. The mixture was gently shaken at 300C for 4 hours to thereby effect epoxidization of hydrophilic hydroxyl groups exsisting on the micropore surface. The eDoxidized Cellulofine was washed with 500 ml of distilled water, reacted with 6.7 ml of ethylenediamine and 1.05 ml of 1 N aqueous sodium hydroxide at 60dC for 2.5 hours, then washed with water and collected by filtration.To 1 g of the ethylenediamine coupled Cellulofine collected by suction filtration were added 10 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 and I ml of 25 glutaraldehyde solution, and the mixture was shaken overnight at room temperature, washed with phosphate buffer and filtered to give an aldehydo Cellulolfine. The aldehydo Cellulofine and 1,500 U of lipase MY were reacted overnight in phosphate buffer, giving a Cellulofine immobilized lipase preparation. A substrate solution composed of 100 mg of cholesterol, 220 mg of oleic acid and 2 ml of isooctane and 8 ml of phosphate buffer were added to the above immobilized enzyme preparation and the reaction was performed for 18 hours. After reaction, the reaction mixture was filtered, and the same substrate solution as above was added to the immobilized enzyme preparation recovered and the reaction was carried out again The above procedure was repeated three times in all. The synthesis ratio in the third reaction was 94.0 . Example 39 Dowex MM7A 1 1 g was washed with distilled water and 1 15 M McIlvaine buffer pH 5.0 . Thereto was added 0.2 ml 1,500 U of an aqueous lipase MY solution. The mixture was shaken overnight at 80C to thereby cause adsorption, followed by addition of 1 ml of McIlvaine buffer and 80 iji of 25 glutaraldehyde solution. The whole mixture was shaken at 80C for 10 minutes to effect coupling with the ion exchange resin.Finally, 0.2 ml of 20 sodium bisulfite was added and the resulting mixture was shaken at 800C for 10 minutes to thereby remove the excess glutaraldehyde.After washing with water, there was obtained an immobilized enzyme preparation. The above immobilized enzyme preparation was added to a substrate solution composed of 100 mg of cholesterol, 220 mg of oleic acid and 15 ml of isooctane, and the reaction was carried out for 18 hours. After reaction, the reaction mixture was filtered and the reaction was carried out again in the same reaction system as in the first reaction using the immobilized enzyme thus recovered. The reaction was repeated three times in all. As a result, the synthesis ratio in the third reaction was 96,5 . Example 40 One gram of Octyl Sepharose Ct 4B product ofPharmacia Fine Chemicals having increased hy ro phobicity as a result of modification of agarose with hydrophobic octyl groups was washed well with 0.1 M phospahte buffer pH 7.0 and filtered To this was added a solution of 3,000 U of lipase MY in 5 ml of 0.05 M phosphate buffer, and was shaken gently at 00C for I hour to thereby effect adsorption of the enzyme onto Octyl Sepharose. After I hour, the resin was washed with 1 ml of phosphate buffer, collected by filtration and submitted to the reaction. The reaction was carried out in the same manner as In Example 39 except that the reaction time was 16 hours. After 4 repetitions of the above reaction, the synthesis ratio in the fourth reaction was 94.8 Example 41 To 1 g of Celite were added 2,000 U of lipaseMY or 1,000 U of cholesterol esterase T 18 and 5 ml of phosphate buffer pH 7.0 , and the mixture was shaken at room temperature for 1 hour to cause adsorption.After 1 hour, the Celfte was filtered off, washed with 1 ml of phosphate buffer, returned to the reaction vessel together with the filter paper and used as an immobilized enzyme. The reaction was repeated five times in the same manner as in Example 39 except that the reaction time was 18 hours. The synthesis ratio in the fifth reaction was 94.1 when the immobilized lipase MY was used and 94.5 when the immobilized cholesterol esterase was used. Example 42 In this example, the relationship between the synthesis ratio of, the sterol ester and the raw material quantity ratio substrate ratio , fatty acid ester to sterol, was studied. Thus, 100 mg of cholesterol hereinafter abbreviated as cho and a specified amount of methyl oleate hereinafter, MO were used and a solution of 1,000 U 33.3 mg of lipase MY in 8 ml of 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 hereinafter, PB was added to the reaction system. The above substrates were dissolved in 3.0 ml of isooctane, so that the reaction system was a water organic solvent two phase systemThe reaction vessel used was a cylindrical glass bottle, 3 cm in inside diameter and 5 cm in height, with a screw cap. In the examples that follow, the same shall apply unless otherwise specifically stated. The synthesis ratio of the cholesteryl oleate hereinafter, CO as obtained by 2 hours of reaction is given in Table 23 for each run. The ratio was calculated by the following equation 2 Synthesis ratio g CO peak area x 100 CO peak area cho peak area 2 In the examples that follow, unless otherwise stated, synthesis ratio calculation was performed using the above equation 2 .

Example 43 The reaction was conducted in the same manner as in Example 42 except that using 100 mg of cho, a specified amount of MO shown in Table 24, 2 ml of isooctane, 8 ml of PB and 500 U of lipase MY and that the reaction time was 6 hours. .The results obtained are shown in Table 24.Since cho was used in large excess, the synthesis ratio was calculated by the following equation 3 Synthesis ratio z CO peak area x 100 CO peak area MO peak area oleic acid peak area 3 Table 24 Amount of MO Synthesis ratio Run No. moles per mole of cho 1 1.0 81.2 2 0.8 81.1 3 0.7 82.2 4 0.6 87.0 5 0.5 89.3 6 0.4 90.3 7 0.3 90.2 8 0.2 94.4 9 0.1 97.3 Unlike Table 23, Table 24 shows that, when cho is used in excess, the synthesis ratio increases as the amount of MO, hence the mole ratio, decreases.Considering the results in this example and in Example 42, it may be concluded that either of the substrates may be in excess and that a greater difference in the number of moles gives a higher synthesis ratio, Example 44 In this example, the synthesis ratio of the desired ester was examined in an aqueous medium system and in a water containing organic solvent system. Thus, the reaction vessel was charged with 100 mg of cho, 230 mg of MO and 1,000 U of lipase MY, followed by addition of PB and or isooctane in respec tive amounts given in Table 25. Then, the reaction was carried out for 4 hours. The results obtained are shown in Table 25.

The synthesis ratio is low in that case presumably because the enzyme remains as a solid in the reaction mixture to form flocs, which make it difficult for the enzyme supposedly functioning at the water hydrophobic layer interface to have a sufficient contact area and which results in such small amount of water available for the hydrolysis of the raw fatty acid ester as compared with other reaction conditions that said hydrolysis reaction is rendered rate determining. Example 45 The reaction was carried out using isooctane and PB in amounts shown in Table 26 and a 500 mlSakaguchi flask as the reaction vessel. The reaction conditions were the same as in Example 44 except that the Sakaguchi flask was shaken on a shaker IwashiyaBio Science Co., Ltd. at a stroke of 6 cm and a frequency of 120 cpm. The results obtained are shown in Table 26.

Example 46 I n this example, the reaction was performed in an aqueous medium system in which PB alone was used without any organic solvent using 1,000 U of lipase MY and cho and MO as substrates in amounts given in Table 27 the mole ratio cho MO being constantly 1 2 to give the desired CO. The results thus obtained are shown inTable 27.

In all the runs, olive oil was completely hydrolyzed in 1.5 hours.The results obtained are shown in Table 33 The synthesis ratio for run Nos. 1 and 2 were calculated according to the equation 2 mentioned above and those for run Nos. 3 5 were calculated by the following equation 6 Synthesis CO peak area x 100 ratio CO peak area fatty acid peak area 6 Table 33 Run No. Olive oil mg Synthesis ratio t 1 229 96.6 2 114.5 94.5 3 76.3 96.3 4 57.2 97.1 5 45.8 97.5 Example 53 The reaction was conducted using, as sub strates, 100 mg of cho and specified amounts of an oil or fat given in Table 34, together with 1,000 U of liapse MY.

Then, the upper layer was sampled and assayed for the synthesis ratio of CO. Thereafter, the mixture was allowed to stand, the upper isooctane layer was removed while leaving that interface portion with the aqueous layer, followed by further addition of 16 ml of isooctane. After stirring and standing, 15 ml of the isooctane layer was removed to thereby wash away the unreacted substrates and the reaction product remaining in the interface portion. After repeating the above procedure twice in all, 100 mg of cho, 153 mg of MO and 1 ml of isooctane were again added to the enzymecontaining.aqueous layer and the reaction was performed for 3 hours. The invention was practiced by repeating 7 times in all the above procedure comprising removing the upper substrate and reaction product containing isooctane layer after reaction while leaving the aqueous lipase containing layer and the interface layer, and then adding new portions of substrates and isooctane. The results thus obtained are shown in Table 35. During the period from assaying the synthesis ratio to addition of new substrate portions, the reaction mixture was maintained in a state in which the enzyme and substrates were in contact with one another. Table 35 Repeated reaction run No. Synthesis ratio 1 91.0 2 91.4 3 90.4 4 91.1 5 92.3 6 90.5 7 89.6 The data in Table 35 indicate that repetition of the above synthesis reaction does not lead to any loss in enzyme activity at all. Example 55 The procedure of Example 21 was repeated using 230 mg of methyl a hydroxypalmitate in lieu of a hyaroxypalmitic acid. The synthesis ratio in the first reaction was 72.5 and that in the second reaction was 70.44. Example 56 The continuous reaction apparatus shown by the flowchart in Fig. 6 was used, the column portion G2 thereof was filled with 500 ml of a 108 U ml lipase MY solution in PB, and a substrate solution composed of cho MO isooctane 1,200 mug 1,860 mg 600 ml was introduced into the aqueous enzyme solution layer portion G2 in the form of oily droplets at a rate of 8.52 ml min through the column bottom nozzle N1 by means of the pump P1 . The reaction product containing isooctane layer as separated in the portion G1 of the glass column was withdrawn continuously at a rate of 0.127 ml min into the reaction mixture tank T4 .The isooctane solution overflowing from the receptacle Ti was led to the mixing vessel T2 , where said solution was mixed with a new substrate solution having the same composition as above as fed at a rate of 0.127 ml min from the raw material tank T3 by means of the pump P3 . The resulting substrate solution was fed again to the G2 portion of the glass column at a rate of 8.52 ml min by means of the pump P1 through the nozzle N1 . In this manner, the substrate solution was recycled into the aqueous enzyme solution repeatedly while sampling the reaction mixture at 3 hour intervals using the autosampler A . The results of assay of the samples for ester synthesis ratio are shown in Fig. 9 obtained in the same manner as Fig. 7. Until about 48 hours after start of the reaction, the isooctane layer in the upper part G1 of the column was in an emulsified state. However, phase separation began as the reaction proceeded and was complete at about 64 hours. Fig. 9 shows that when the above procedure is followed, the desired ester can be continuously synthesized using the enzyme repeatedly and that the synthesis ratio can be maintained at a level not less than 80 without replacement or supplementation of the enzyme for 240 hours or longer. Example 57 A vessel was divided into two compartments 3 with Duraguard 2500. The lower compartment 8 cm in capacity below said membrane was filled with 8 cm3 of an aqueous 595 U ml solution of lipase MY A communication tube connected thereto was also filled with the same aqueous enzyme solution, so that the liquid level in said tube was 30 cm higher than the membrane level. The upper compartment of the above vessel was charged with a substrate solution composed of 100 mg of cho, 153 mg of MO and 10 ml of isooctane. The reaction was carried out for 48 hours while shaking the whole vessel on a shaker reciprocating at a stroke of 6 cm and a frequency of 120 cpm. As a result, a synthesis ratio of 87.28 was obtained. The reaction system was not emulsified. No penetration of water into the substrate phase was observed. Example 58 Duraguard 2500 was immersed in methanol and in water to thereby render the membrane hydrophilic as a result of substitution of the micropore contents with water. This hydrophilic membrane was used in place ofDuraguard 2500 used in Example 57. The upper and lower compartments relative to said membrane were charged with the same substrate solution and aqueous enzyme solution, respectively. In this example, the communication tube liquid level was the same as the membrane level, however. The reaction was conducted in the same manner as in Example 57 and, when the synthesis ratio arrived at 90 or higher, substrate solution replacement was made. The reaction was repeated in this way 10 times in all. The synthesis ratio and the amounts of CO were determined for each run. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 10.In the figure, the abscissa indicates the reaction time hrs and the ordinate the amount of CO mg . Fig. 10 shows that when a hydrophilic membrane is used, the aqueous enzyme solution permeates the micropores of the membrane and comes into contact with the substrates above the membrane to catalyze the reaction, so that the reaction can be continued without need of supplementation or replacement of the enzyme for about 500 hours or longer and gives 1,280 mg of CO after 500 hours. Example 53 The procedure of Example 57 was followed using five kinds of membranes given in Table 36. The lower compartment had a volume of 8 cm3. The reaction was carried out in the same manner as in Example 57.The results thus obtained are also shown below in Table 36.

Example 60 A glass column, 2 cm in inside diameter and 46 cm in length, was charged with 900,000 U 30 g of the immobilized lipase MY as prepared in the same manner as in the procedure 2 of Example 31 to a height of about 36 cm. A substrate solution composed of 1,000 mg of cho, 1,534 mg of MO and 150 ml of isooctane was circulated through the above column at a rate of 6.3,ml rnin. When the CO synthesis ratio reached about 80 , the substrate solution was replaced with a new one and the reaction was repeated. As in Example 46 Table 27 , the synthesis ratio obtained in each run was converted to the synthesis amount of CO and the relation between said amount and the reaction time was studied. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 11 in the same manner asFig. 10. Example 61 To 2,000 U 19.0 mg of the immobilized cholesterol esterase T 18 were added 100 mg of cho, 153 mg of MO and 15 ml of isooctane, and the reaction was carried out. The reaction mixture was filtered once a day except for holidays and, using the thus recovered immobilized enzyme, the reaction was repeated for 79 days in the same reaction system as in the first reaction while replacing the substrate solution with a new one each time. The time course of the reaction on the 80th day is shown in Table 37.

This procedure was repeated three times in all. The synthesis ratio in the third reaction is shown below in Table 38 for each enzyme preparation.

After reaction, the reaction mixture was filtered, the same substrate solution as above was added to the immobilized enzyme preparation recovered, and the reaction was again carried out. The above procedure was repeated three times.The synthesis ratio in the third reaction was 95.2 .
