# HELIUM GAS LIQUEFYING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A helium gas liquefying apparatus which has a com pressor receiving helium gas stock, plural heat exchangers connected in series with each other via a series liquefying line, plural expansion engines connected in parallel with the corresponding heat exchangers, a Joule Thompson s valve connected via the liquefying line, a series return line disposed in the reverse flow of the heat exchangers to the liquefying line, a recovery line connected from the reservoir through a recovery valve to the inlet of the compressor, first to third thermometers and a pressure gage. Thus, the apparatus can be fully automatized in various preliminary operations without complicated operations of the conven tional apparatus by providing not only the thermometers and the pressure gage but a recovery valve interposed between a liquefied He reservoir and a recovery line.
