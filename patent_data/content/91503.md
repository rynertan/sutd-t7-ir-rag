## Description
Process of combatting fungal infections. This invention relates to a process of combatting fungal infections in agricultural products and foodstuffs, to compositions to be used in this process and their preparation and to products treated by said process. Agricultural products, such as fruits, vegetables, seeds and bulbs and foodstuffs like cheese and sausage can be affected by fungi. Some examples of plant pathogen fungi arePenicillum digitatum and P. italicum on oranges, Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium species on flower bulbs, tubers and grains, Drechslera sorokiniana and D. teres in barley,Ascochyta pisi and Mycosphaerella pinodes in peas, etc. In the European patent application 81201040.3, filed on September 16, 1981, and included herein by reference, fungicidal compounds are described with the general formulaEMI1.1 in which n is 0, 1 or 2, R1 represents a halogen atom, a trifluoromethyl group or an alkyl or alkoxy group with at most 6 carbon atoms, the two substituents being the same or different when n is 2, R2 represents an alkyl group with 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group with 2 to 4 carbon atoms or a cycloalkyl group with 3 to 6 carbon atoms, R3 represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group with 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an alkenyl group with 2 to 4 carbon atoms and Rq represents a hydrogen atom,,an alkyl group with 1 to 6 carbon atoms or a nitro group, and their acid addition salts. It is stated that the compounds are suited for combatting fungal infections in humans and animals. It has now been found that the compounds of formula I can also effectively be used in combatting fungal infections in agricultural products and foodstuffs. The invention therefore provides a process for combatting fungal infections in agricultural products and foodstuffs which comprises treating them with a compound of formula I or an acid addition salt thereof. The invention also includes the products thus treated. The treatment is preferably carried out with a compound of formula I in which Rl n is 4 chloro or 2,4 dichloro, R2 is ethyl, propyl or sec butyl and R3 and R4 are hydrogen atoms. Particularly preferred is a treatment with l 2 2,11 dichlorophenyl l pentenyl lH imidazole or an acid addition salt thereof. The activities of the compounds of formula I have been shown in in vitro experiments with pathogenic moulds and in tests with infected products. In experiments with agricultural products no phytotoxic effects were found. The invention also comprises formulations for combatting fungal infections in agricultural products and foodstuffs, which comprise as the active ingredient at least one compound of formula I or an acid addition salt thereof. It is preferred to use liquid formulations, such as solutions, suspensions and emulsions of the active substance in water or an organic solvent. The free bases of formula I can be dissolved in organic solvents, for instance in hydrocarbon mixtures such as petrol, aromatic compounds like benzene, hydrocarbon chlorides such as chlorobenzenes, chloromethanes and chloroethanes, alcohols like butanol and glycol or strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide. It is preferred to use the compounds in the form of their acid addition salts, which can be dissolved in water to which a surfactant e.g. a glyceride may be added. Examples of other types of formulations are sprays, in which the active substance is mixed with an aerosol propelling gas such as dichlorodifluoromethane or trichlorofluoromethane, and powders consisting of a mixture of the active substance with a solid carrier, such as kaoline, talc or diatom earth. The treatment of the products may be carried out, for example, by mixing them with or immersing them in a liquid containing a compound of formula I or an acid addition salt thereof, or to sprinkle or brush them with such a liquid. It will be understood that the amount of active compound to be used will depend on the kind of product to be treated, particularly on its surface volume. Examples of preferred amounts in proportion to the treated products are for seeds diameters between 0.5 and 10 mm 1 10,000 ppm by weight, more preferably 10 2000 ppm for tubers and bulbs diameters between 0.5 and 6 cm 0.2 1500 ppm by weight, more preferably 2 300 ppm for cheese 0.5 500 mcg cm2, more preferably 2 20 mcg cm2. The following examples 1 through 7 illustrate that the claimed compounds are not phytotoxic. Germination tests were done with seeds of corn, pea, barley, wheat, sugarbeet, garden cress and mangel. The active ingredients were used as a 10 w v solution in water containing a surface active agent 10g l of diacetyltartaric acid ester of mono and diglycerides . Solution A contained a mixture of Z and E isomers of 1 2 2,11 dichlorophenyl l butenyl lH imidazole hydrochloride Solution B contained a mixture of Z and E isomers of 1 2 2,11 dichlorophenyl lpentenyl lllimidazole hydrochloride Solution C contained a mixture of Z and E isomers of 1 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl 3 methyl 1 pentenyl 1H imidazole hydrochloride Solution D contained the Z isomer of 1 2 4 thlorophenyl 3 methyl l pentenylJ lll imidazole hydrochloride As references the following commercial fungicide compositions were used Captolate AC, a powder formulation containing 50 of captan and 35Z of anthraquinone AAtiram AT S, a powder formulation containing 50 of thiram and 35 of anthraquinone Panoctine Plus, a liquid formulation containing 30 w v of guazatine and 2.5 w v of imazalil Neo Voronit, a liquid formulation containing 33.6 w v of sodiumdimethyldithiocarbamate and 0.561 w v of fuberidazole AAtiram 75 S, a slurry containing 75 of thiram. These are recommended fungicide compositions for the disinfection of parent seeds. Example 1 400 g of corn seeds Dorina were put into a flask of ca 750 ml. The size of the flask should be such that only about 66 of the volume is filled with seeds. The test composition was then added with gentle shaking. The flask was tightly closed with a screw cap and then clamped to the edge of a rotating wheel diameter circa 70 cm . In order to mix thoroughly the wheel was rotated during 20 minutes at a speed of 25 30 rpm. The germination of the seeds was done in an aluminium tray of about 14x17x3 cm, filled with riversand. The trays, each containing 50 seeds, were incubated in a climatic box at a relative humidity of 95 100 . Eight trays were taken for each treatment. During the incubation the temperature was varied every 24 hours, alternately 30 C during 8 hrs with exposure to artificial daylight and 200C in darkness during 16 hours. After 7 days of incubation the degree of germination was evaluated. The results are summarized in Table 1. Example 2 400 g of peas Finale were mixed with test compo sition and germinated as described in Example 1, except that the temperature was kept constantly at 200C during germination and that the degree of germination was evaluated after nine days of incubation. The results are summarized in Table 2. Example 3 40 g of barley seeds Banteng in a bottle of 200 ml were treated with test composition. The seeds were mixed thoroughly with the fungicide by clamping the closed bottle to a rotating wheel diameter circa 70 cm and mixing for 20 minutes. The seeds were germinated in aluminium trays of 14x17x3 cm filled with silver sand. The trays, each containing 100 seeds were first incubated for three days in darkness at 10 C and then alternately in the dark 16 hours and in artificial daylight 8 hours at 20 C with a relative humidity of 95 100 . Four trays were taken for each treatment. After 7 days at 20 C the degree of germination was evaluated. The results are summarized in Table 3. Example 4 The procedures described in example 3 were repeated, except that wheat Caribo was taken instead of barley. The results are summarized in Table 4. Example 5 50 g of sugar beet seeds were put into a bottle of 200 ml. The test composition was added with gentle shaking.The bottle was tightly closed with the screw cap and then clamped to the edge of a turning wheel diameter circa 70 cm .In order to mix thoroughly the wheel was kept turning during 20 minutes at a speed of 25 30 rpm. The presoaked seeds 4 hrs, 25 C were germinated within folded filter paper sheets. Two seeds were put between each fold, and the filter paper containing 100 seeds was then placed in a plastic tray of 21x15x3 cm. After addition of 130 ml of water the tray mas covered with a plastic lid. The trays each containing 100 seeds were incubated at 20 C. Four trays were taken for each treatment. After 7 and 14 days of incubation the degree of germination was estimated. The results are summarized in Table 5. Example 6 40 g of garden cress seeds Gromono were put into a bottle of 100 ml. The test composition was added with gentle shaking. The bottle was closed tightly with the screw cap and then clamped to a turning wheel diameter circa 70 cm . In order to mix thoroughly the wheel was kept turning during 20 minutes at a speed of 25 30 rpm. The seeds were germinated on circular filter discs Type T 300, Schut en Zn, Heelsum, The Netherlands . The filter discs, each with 100 seeds, were preincubated for 2 days at 10 C and then put on a Jacobsen apparatus or Kopenhagen tables and incubated at 200 C. Four discs were taken for each treatment. During the preincubation and the incubation the paper discs were covered with a transparant plastic beaker. After 2 and 10 days of incubation the degree of germination was estimated. The results are summarized in Table 6. The Table shows that there are no phytotoxic effects on garden cress seeds, which generally are highly susceptible to fungicide treatment. Example 7 The amount of the added ethenylimidazole compound was varied. The following compositions were used Solution B containing 1 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl 1 pentenyl3 lH imidazole hydrochloride 100 g l and diacetyl tartaric acid ester of mono and diglycerides 10 g l in water. Solution B1 the same as solution B except that it contained 50 g l instead of 100 g l of the ethenyl imidazole compound. Solution B2 the same as solution B, except that it contained 25 g l instead of 100 g l of the ethenyl imidazole. Solution B3 the same as solution B, only with 5 g l instead of 100 g l of the ethenyl imidazole. Solution B4 the same as solution B, only with 0.5 g l instead of 100 g l of the ethenyl imidazole. AAtiram 75 S a slurry containing 75 of thiram. 50 g of mangel seeds were put into a bottle of 200 ml. With gentle shaking 0.8 ml 16 ml kg of test composition was added. The bottle was closed with the screw cap and the seeds were mixed thoroughly with the test composition by clamping the bottle on a turning wheel 20 minutes, 25 30 rpm . The reference seeds were first treated with 0.8 ml of water, thoroughly mixed, and then mixed with 0.3 g ofAAtiram 75 S. Before germination the seeds were presoaked in water 4 hrs, 25 C . The germination was done within folded filter paper sheets. Two seeds were put between each fold and the filter sheets, each containing 100 seeds were placed in a plastic tray 21x15x3 cm . After addition of 3 ml of water to each tray, the trays were covered with a plastic lid. Four trays were taken for each treatment and incubated at 20 C. After 7 and 14 days of incubation the degree of germination was estimated. The results are summarized in Table 7.The following examples 8 and 9 illustrate the inhibitory capacity of the ethenylimidazole compounds towards seedborn fungal infections. Example 8 Solutions B and D were compared with Panoctine Plus for the inhibition of seedborn Drechslera sorokiniana and D.teres. 40 g of barley seeds a 1 3 mixture of Atem andBirgit were mixed thoroughly with the fungicides in the way as described in the previous examples. The seeds were incubated with the so called TP method top of paper method .A piece of gray underfelt quality T 1OD, 730 g m2 from Schut en Zn, Heelsum was placed in a perforated zinc tray of 11x27x2 cm. The underfelt was covered with white filter paper type V 270, 132 g m2, Schut en Zn and 50 seed kernels were put on top of the filter paper. The incubation was done in two ways a. 5 days at 1000 in the dark followed by 3 days at 20 C in the dark to evaluate the inhibition of D. sorokiniana, b. 1 day at 20 C in the dark, then 1 day at 20 C in the dark in order to kill the seedlings and finally at 20 C for 7 days with exposure to near UV light 12 hrs periods . The relative humidity in both methods was 95 97 .In both incubation methods four trays were used for each test composition. The results are given in Tables 8a and 8b. Example 9 Solutions B and D were compared with AAtiram AT S for the inhibition of Ascochyta pisi and Mycosphaerella pinodes in peas. 300 g of peas Finale, bearing seedborn infection of Asc. pisi and Myc. pinodes in a bottle of 750 ml were treated with the fungal formulations. The ethenylimidazoles were used in an amount of 2ml kg and AAtiram AT S in an amount of 3 g kg. Untreated peas were used as a control. Mixing was affected in the usual way by means of a rotating wheel. The BP. between paper method was used to incubate the seeds. Underfelt type T 1OD, 730 g m2, Schut en Zn was placed into a perforated zinc tray llx27x2 cm . The underfelt was covered with filter paper type V 270, 132 g m2 , then the peas 75 pieces per tray were placed and covered with anotherV 270 filter paper. The seeds were incubated for 6 days in the dark at 20 C and a relative humidity of 95 97 . The results are summarized in Table 9. Example 10 In this example the effect of the ethenylimidazole compounds on the damping off of corn seeds was tested. 400 g of corn seeds Dorina were used for the treatments. Solutions A, B, C and D were added in an amount of 0.8 ml kg and Captolate AC in an amount of 1.2 g kg. The mixing was effected in the same way as described previously, utilizing a rotating wheel 20 minutes, 25 30 rpm . The seeds were sown into sandy soil maximum moisture capacity 30 w w in plastic trays of 16x13x4 cm. The moisture content of the soil was brought to 22 w w with tap water and then the tray was covered with a transparant plastic lid of 16x13x9 cm. For each treatment 4 trays were taken, each containing 75 seed kernels. The seeds were incubated for 14 days at 10 C, alternately in artificial daylight fluorescent lamps and in darkness periods of 12 hrs . After 14 days the seedling emergence was evaluated. The results are described in Table 10.As can be seen the seeds have been heavily infected, but the treatment with the ethenylimidazole compositions improved the seedling emergence. Composition D was even far better than the standard Captolate AC. Example 11 In this example the effect of varying amounts of l 2 4 chlorophenyl 3 methyl l pentenyl lH imidazole hydrochloride the Z isomer on the damping off of natively infected wheat was evaluated. The following compositions were used D containing 1,00 g l of the ethenylimidazole compound and 10 g l of diacetyl tartaric acid ester of monoand diglycerides as a surface active agent. D1 the same as D, only containing 50 g l of the ethenylimidazole compound instead of 100 g 1. D2 the same as D, only containing 10 g l of the ethenylimidazole compound instead of 100 g l. D3 the same as D, only containing 1 g l of the ethenylimidazole compound instead of 100 g l. D4 the same as D, only containing 200 g l of the ethenylimidazole compound instead of 100 g l. Neo Voronit 3 ml kg was used as a control composition. To 40 g of wheat seeds Marksman, with seed born fungal infection in a 200 ml bottle 120 mcl 3 ml kg of test composition were added. After mixing thoroughly by means of a rotating wheel as described before, the seeds were sown into sandy soil in a plastic tray of 30x45x9 cm. The maximum moisture capacity of the soil was 38Z w w . Tap water was added to the soil to a moisture content of 22 and then the tray was covered with a transparant plastic lid of 30x45x9 cm.Two trays, each containing 150 seed kernels, were incubated at 12 C in darkness and with exposure to artificial daylight 12 hrs periods utilizing fluorescent lamps. After incubating for 17 days the degree of fungal attack was evaluated. As standard treatments a control without fungicide and a treatment with Neo Voronit 3 ml kg were utilized. The results are summarized in Table 11.A slight delay of the emergence of the seedling was observed, but no phytotoxicity. The inhibition of fungal attack was equal to or better than the standard treatment with NeoVoronit. Example 12 In this example the control of fungal decay of natively infected wheat was studied. Solution C was compared with Neo Voronit and a blanc. The treatment and incubation procedures were the same as described in the previous example. After 17 days of incubation at 12 C the degree of fungal attack was estimated. The results are given in Table 12. A slight delay of the emergence of the seedlings was observed, but the inhibition was equal to the standard treatment. Example 13 Commercially available plastic cheese coatings containing the fungicidal compounds were applied to freshly brined Gouda cheeses of 4 kg. The coating liquid was applied with a sponge in two stages. Firstly one side of the cheeses was treated and after drying the next day the other side was treated. The cheeses were stored at 14 C and a relative humidity of 85 90 . During storage the cheeses were turned over every week. Delvocid Instant, a 50 wetting powder formulation of natamycin and a control plastic without a fungicide were utilized as standards for comparison purposes. 6 Cheeses were used for each treatment. After 11, 15 and 26 days of storage the appearance of the cheeses was evaluated. The results are summarized inTable 13. As can be seen 1 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl 1 pentenyl lH imidazole hydrochloride is as effective asDelvocid for the conservation of cheeses. Example 14 This example shows the potency of the ethenylimidazole compounds to inhibit plant pathogen fungi.The minimal inhibitory concentration i.e. the minimal concentration inhibiting growth of the micro organism of several ethenylimidazole compounds against various plant pathogens was determined by means of standard microbiological assays. The results are shown in Table 14. Compound A 1 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl 1 butenyl lH imidazole hydrochloride. Compound B 1 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl 1 pentenyl lH imidazole hydrochloride Compound C 1 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl 3 methyl 1 pentenyl lH imidazole hydrochloride Compound D 1 12 4 chlorophenyl 3 methyl 1 pentenyl lH imidazole hydrochloride Z isomer Compound E 1 2 4 chlorophenyl 3 methyl 1 pentenyl lH imidazole hydrochloride E isomer Compound F 1 2 4 chlorophenyl 3 methyl 1 pentenyl 1H imidazole hydrochloride E Z isomers mixture. Example 15 This example shows that the surface active agent used in the seed experiments have no fungicidal activity. By means of standard microbiological assays the minimal inhibitory concentrations of compound C and compound D with and without surface active agent were determined. The ratio of the surface active agent, diacetyl tartaric acid ester of mono and diglycerides, to the fungicide is the same as in the seed experiments. The results are summarized in Table 15. Example 16 By means of standard microbiological assays the minimal inhibitory concentrations of compounds A, B and F against food spoiling yeasts and moulds were determined. The results are shown in Table 16.
