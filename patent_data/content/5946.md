# Time period comparing device.

## Abstract
A time period comparing device for use in, for example, monitoring the rotational velocity of a fan, for comparing the time period of an input signal with a reference signal, which comprises a reference oscillator 2 , a reference period counter 3 for generating the reference signal and a time period comparator 4 for comparing the input signal with the reference signal. In the preferred form, this device also comprises means 5, Fig. 4B for preventing the device from operating when the input signal is irregular and delay means 6, Fig. 6B for stopping this device from operating for a given interval from the time when the power is turned on.
