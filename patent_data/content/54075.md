# CELLULOSE TREATING AGENT AND PAPER PRODUCTS SIZED THEREWITH.

## Abstract
A cellulose treating agent obtained by using, as an emulsifying and dispersing agent, a reaction product be tween aliphatic carboxylic acid or a mixture thereof contain ing at least 20 wt. aliphatic monohydroxycarboxylic acid having 9 to 32 carbon atoms and a polyalkylenepolyamine, or a reaction product obtained by reacting the above described reaction product with epihalohydrin, and dispers ing alkylketene dimer in water with the aid of the emulsifying and dispersing agent. This cellulose treating agent stabilizes a cation dispersion of alkylketene dimer, and enables fibers to be made water repellent in an effective manner. Further, it can be used as a reactive sizing agent for making paper.
