# PLATE MAKING PROCESS USING POSITIVE WORKING PRESENSITIZED PLATE

## Abstract
A plate making process for easy elimination of unneces sary image parts from a positive working presensitized plate, which includes the steps of, in sequence, exposing a positive working presensitized plate to active rays through a positive transparency, irradiating desired to be exposed but unex posed parts of the presensitized plate with active rays con ducted by an optical fiber, and developing the thus optically exposed presensitized plate or which includes the steps of, in sequence, exposing a positive working presensitized plate to active rays through an original transparency, developing the photo exposed presensitized plate, irradiating unnecessary image parts of the developed presensitized plate with active rays conducted by an optical fiber, and developing the result ing plate again.
