# Apparatus for detecting discharge gap in electric discharge machining.

## Abstract
In electric discharge machining DC voltage pulses are applied between a machining electrode H and a workpiece W to machine the workpiece W . A voltage peak detecting circuit R1, R2, TR2, AS1, R6, C responsive to discharge voltage between the electrode H and the workpiece W detects a peak value of the discharge voltage. An A to D converter converts the voltage across a capacitor C of the peak detecting circuit into first digital data which is supplied to a first ROM 1 . A waiting time detecting circuit is also responsive to the discharge voltage for detecting a waiting time between the start of the DC pulse voltage and the start of discharge and includes a reference voltage source R7, R8 and a comparator CP . A second A to D converter converts the wait time signal from the comparator CP into second digital data which is supplied to a second ROM 2 . A numerical control circuit NC supplies compensating data for compensating the first digital data in accordance with a machining condition and the second digital data in accord ance with a machining condition to the two ROMs 1 and 2 . The ROMs compute the discharge gap signal and an adder FA adds the digital data from the ROMs.
