# Process and apparatus for slime and sludge dewatering.

## Abstract
An anode 24 and cathode 25 are provided with sludge S disposed between the electrodes, and with a material 30 for providing a continuation of the boundary layer of the sludge disposed in intimate contact with at least the cathode 25 between the cathode and the sludge, the material allowing the passage of water therethrough, and the cathode being constructed to allow passage of water therethrough. The sludge to be treated is maintained between the electrodes during treatment, and structure is provided to ensure continuous contact between the elec trodes and the sludge or the like during treatment even as the volume of the sludge decreases due to water removal. The treatment may be continuous or batch, and by practis ing the invention it is possible to render sludge incapable of being dewatered by ambient evaporation so that it is capable of being dewatered by ambient evaporation, while applying only about 200 kWh or less of energy per 1000 gallons of sludge. It is possible to produce a product suf ficiently free of heavy metals to be safely used as a fertilizer from sewage sludge containing significant amounts of heavy metals since the heavy metals pass out of the sludge with the water removed therefrom.
