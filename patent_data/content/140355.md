# Method and apparatus for controlling hydraulically operated continuously variable transmission of belt and pulley type.

## Abstract
System and method for controlling a continuously variable transmission 10 having a pair of variable diameter pulleys 24, 26 disposed on input and output shafts 32,34 , and a corresponding pair of hydraulic cylinders 44,50 to change effective diameters of the pulleys 44,50 . A speed ratio control valve assembly 58,60 152,154 156,160 162 is used to control flows of a fluid to and from one 44 of the cylinders. The control valve assembly 58,60 152,154 156,160 162 is selectively placed in one of three states consisting of a first state for feeding the fluid to the one cylinder 44 , a second state for discharging the fluid from the one cylinder 44 , and a third state for restricting the flow to or from said cylinder. The first and third states are alternately established while a ratio of an operating time in the first state to that in the third state is changed, for controlling a rate of flow of the fluid into said cylinder 44 , and the second and third states are alternately established while a ratio of operating time in the second state to that in the third state is changed, for controlling a rate of flow of the fluid from the one cylinder, whereby the speed ratio of the transmission 10 is continuously varied by the one cylinder 44 under control of the speed ratio control valve assembly 58,60 152,154 156,160 162 .
