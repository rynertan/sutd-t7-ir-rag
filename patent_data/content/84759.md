## Description
Additive to add the water circulating in civil and indu strial heating plants, in order to reduce their.energy requirements.The present invention relates to a particular additive, hereinafter also named P44, to be added to the heating plant water, which reduces the energy consumption of said plants, other conditions being equal. 1 We have found that the starting and blowing out times of the same heating plant, in which once circulated the water and once the liquid water with additive , were notably dif ferent. More precisely we have found that in the heating of a plant, containing water and an additive in suitable proportion, the burner remains blown out for a longer time than when the plant contains water alone.The said additive comprises a solution of a thickener agent, preferably selected in the group comprising a polymer of the salified acrylic acid, salified carboxymethylcellulose and an alkaline alginate.Among the employed polymers, very good results were obtained with water soluble polymers of the salified acrylic acid,nam ed Densomol, Montedison name, having a pH between 8 and 9, and used, e.g., as cloth permanent dressing.Further we have found that the thickner solution is compatible with the ethylene glycol and with other alcohols, known in particular as antifreezers.The addition of butylic alcohol and particularly of isopropylic alcohol allows a bitter solubilization of the thickner agent surprisingly affording further energy reduction.A small amount, say O,11 of ammonia may be advantageously added to the additive which regulates the pH between 7 and 9 and reacts with chlbrine if chlorine is present in the water.In such conditions we have found that the obnoxious effects of chlorine, which tends to obstacle the reduction of the heating plant energy consumption, are overcome.A small amount, e.g. 0,1 1 , of formaldehyde may be added, .1 as a bactericide, and the same amount of a sequestrant, such as polyphosphate or the ethylenediamine tetracetic acid so dium salt may be used. Other substances such as antirust, sur factants, antifoam and also others may be added.Preferably the additive, for transport economy, may be sold as Ã…a concentrated aqueousviscous solution containing said polymer of the salified acrylic acid, ethylene giycol, isopropylic alcohol, ammonia, formaldehyde, the ethylenediamine tetracetic acid sodium salt, having e.g. the following composition in parts by weight p.b.w. thickener agent p.b.w. 80 Isopropanol 12 Ethyleneglycol 4 Ammonia 0,15 Formaldehyde II 0,2 Ethylenediamine tetracetic acid sodium salt 0,4 Antifoam II 0,6 Water, balance to 100 Naturally it is also possible to have an additive containing one or more other polymers and one or more other substances one of these different additives is added to the water of the heating plant, having first discharged therefrom an equal water volume.Hereinafter we report the composition intervals of the circulating liquid additioned with an additive of the inventionThickener agent 0,2 2,0Propylic alcohol 0 0,35Ethylene glycol 0 0,2Formaldehyde 0 0,025Ammonia 0 0,025Ethylenediamine tetracetic acid sodium salt 0 0,025Anti foam 0 0,025 Water, balance to 100 The amount of ethylene glycol may be further increased if it is wished to further lower the freezing point of the additive and water mixture.We have surprisingly discovered that, employing the additive of the present invention in such an amount as to have in the circulating water a content in thickener agent, generally not higher than 2 of the whole quantity of the water contained in a heating plant, one can obtain an energy saving of about 25 , as it results from the example hereinafter referred to.Numerous have been the experiments performed on heating plants also of different potentiality and type, e.g. on plants for the production of sanitary hot water, with heat exchangers,in different localities and with different fuels always obtaining an energy saving around 25 .We do not wish to refer here on the causes which allow to said additive said energy saving, but only refer onthereq s in particular obtained in the following example,which appears particularly illustrative.EXAMPLE 1An experiment was started, on a heating plant of 350.000Kcal h, in winter time and lasted 15 days. During this experiment it was controlled that the temperature in the flats was the one programmed of 19 200C. The boiler of the heating plant was regulated at 800C, a four ways motorized mixing valve was in operation and an external temperature probe was provided together with all the necessary control equipment. An additive of the following composition was prepared Thicktner agent p.b.w. 70IsopropanolEthylene glycol fl 4Ammonia at 31,75 0,4Formaldehyde at 36 0,2Ethylenediamine tetracetic acid sodium salt n 0,4 Anti foam 0,6 Water balance to p.b.w. 100This additive was added in a 2 amount to the water of the heating plant, after discharging an equal amount of water , obtaining a mixture having a pH value of 8 and a freezing temperature of 40C.It was found that the external temperature, during the experiment showed only a very limited change.We found in particular that the use of the additive, resulted in a saving of fuel of about 25.
