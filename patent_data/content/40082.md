The present invention provides novel arylsubstituted nicotinates characterized in that they contain a phenyl or substituted phenyl group in the 2 position. More precisely, the new nicotinates are ofFormula I below.EMI3.1 wherein R1 is C1 C6 alkyl or C2 C6 alkenyl, each optionally substituted with a group selected from hydroxy, carboxy, carboxy salt, phenyl and phenyl substituted with up to two of the same or different substituents selected from halogen, methyl, ethyl, methoxy, ethoxy, trifluoromethyl, nitro and cyano R5 is hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl or halogen R6 is hydrogen or C C6 alkyl X is halogen, trihalomethyl, Cl C6 alkyl, nitro, cyano or Cl C6 alkoxy n is O or an integer of 1 3 ard Y is hydrogen or C1 C6 alkyl. Also included in the scope of the invention are, where Y hydrogen, carboxy salts having an agronomically acceptable cation. Also included within the scope oZ the invention are agronomically acceptable acid addition salts of compounds of Formula I. Such salts are possible because the compounds of Formula I possess basic functional groups. Carboxy salts may be those of lithium, sodium, potassium, an alkaline earth metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium Acid audition salts may be formed with acIds such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric nitric, perchloric, acetic and oxalic acids. It will be understood of course that the alkyl and alkenyl groups in the compounds of Formula I may be straight or branched chain. Where in this specification unqualified terms such as propyl or butyl are used the n alkyl groups are intended. These compounds are useful as chemical hydridization agents for monocotyledonous crops and are especially effective in wheat, maize, barley, rice, rye, triticale, sorghum and forage crops. Those compounds of the invention which are highly potent chemical sterilants which produce a high pexcentage ofmale sterility without seriously affecting female fertility of cereal grain and forage crops are especially useful as chemical hybridization agents. As will be seen from the biological data presented later, some of the compounds, particularly at higher application rates, exhibit diminished female fertility along with high male sterility. The latter group of compounds nonetheless have utility for producing new plant hybrids. Although some of the compounds may exhibit some phytotoxicity, the compounds are still useful for the purpose of producing new plant hybrids.In addition to utility as chemical hybridization agents, the compounds of the invention are also useful as chemical sterilants in the agricultural production of ergot.

This material is collected by filtration and discarded.Acidification of the clear filtrate yields 3.4 gms of 5 bromo 1,6 dimethyl 2 phenyl 4 oxo nicotinic acid as a white solid. mp 252 30 acetonitrile . The compounds of the invention are particularly useful as chemical hybridization agents for the production of hybrid seed of ceral crops, such as wheat, barley, corn, rice, sorghum, millets, oats, rye and triticale. When used for this purpose, the compounds are so chosen as to effectively induce a high degree of selective male sterility, that is without also inducing significant female sterility, in the treated plants and without causing significant growth inhibition of the treated plants. As used herein, the term male sterility includes both actual male sterility, as evidenced by a lack of male flower parts or by sterile pollen, and functional male sterility, in which the male flower parts are unable to cause pollination. The compounds of the invention may also cause other plant growth regulatory responses, such as for example control of flowering, control of fruiting and inhibition of seed formation and other related growth regulatory responses. When used as plant growth regulators, the compounds of the invention a2 e applied in any amount which will b sufficient to effect the desired plant response. For example, when the compounds of the invention are used as chemical hybridization agents, they are generally applied to the crops to be treated at a rate of 0.035 kg to 22.42 kg per hectare 1 32 to 20 pounds per acre and preferably 0.14 to 11.21 kg per hectare 1 8 to 10 pounds per acre . The rate of application will vary depending on the crop being treated, the compound being usei for treatment, and related factors. To obtain hydrid seed, the following procedure is generally employed. The two parents to be crossed are planted in alternate strips. The female parent is treated with a compound of the invention. The male sterile female parent thus produced will be pollinated by pollen from the other, mdle fertile, male parent, and the seed produced by the female parent will be hybrid seed which can then be harvested by conventional means. A preferred method of applying a compound of the invention as a chemical hybridization agent is by foriar application. When this method is employed, selective.male sterility is most effectively induced when the compound is applied between anther initiation and meiosis. The compounds of the inventions may also be applied as a seed treatment by soaking the seed in a liquid formuiation containing the active compound or by coating the seed with te compound.In seed treatment applications, the compounds of the invention will generally be applied at a dose of 113.4 g to 4.54 kg per 45 kg 1 4 to 10 pounds per 8 . The compounds of the invention are also effective when applied to the soil or to the water surface in rice crops. The compounds of the invention can be used as plant growth regulators either individually or in mixtures. For example, they can be used in combination with other plant growth regulators, such as auxins, gibberellins, ethylenereleasing agents such as ethephon, pyridones, pyridazinones, cytokinins, maleic hydrazide, succinic acid 2,2 dimethylhydrazide, chlorine and its salts 2 chloroethyl trimethylammonium chloride, triiodobenzoic acid, tributyl 2, 4 dichlorobenzylphosphonium chloride, polymericN vinyl 2 oxazolidinones, tri dimethylaminoethyl phosphate and its salts, and N dimethylamino 1,2,3,6 tetrahydrophthalamic acid and its salts, and the like, and under some conditions m.y be used advantageously with other agricultural chemicals such as herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, and plant bactericides. A compound of the invention can be applied to the growth medium or to plants to be treated either by itself or, as is generally done, s a component in a growth agronomically acceptable formulation which also comprises an agronomically acceptable carrier. By agronomically acceptable solve, d is meant any substance which can be used to ion withc disperse, or, diffuse a compound in the composition without impiring the effectiveness of the compound and which by itself has no significant detrimental effect on the soil, equipment, crops or agronomic environment. Mixtures of the compounds of the invention may also be used in any of these formulation.s The compositions of the invention can be either solid or liquid formulations or solutions.For example, the compounds can be formulated as wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, dusts, granular formulations, aerosols, or compound ar emulsion concentrates. on such formulations, the compounds are extended with a liquid or solid carrier and, when desired suitable surfactants are incorporated. It is usually desirable, particularly in foliar applications, to include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, and tyhe 1 agents, dispersing agents, stickers, adhesives, and the like, in accordance with agricultural practices.Examples of in the J which are commonly used in the art can be found in the John W. McCutcheon, Inc. publication Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual . The compounds of the invention can be dissolved in any appropriate solvent. Examples of solvents which are useful in the practice of this invention include water, alcohols, ketones, aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, dimethylformamide, dioxane, dimethyl sulfoxide, and the, like. Mixtures of these solvents can vary from about 2 to about 98 by weight with a preferred range being from about 20 to about 75 . For the preparation of emulsifiable concentrates, the compound can be dissolved in organic solvents, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, methylated naphthalene, corn oil, pine oil, o dichlorobenzene, isophorone, cyclohexanone, methyl oleate, and the like, or in mixtures of these solvents, together with an emulsifying agent or surfactant which permits dispersion in water. Suitable emulsifiers include, for example, the ethylene oxide derivative of alkyiphenois or long chain alcohols, mercaptans, carboxylic acids, and reactive amines and partially esterified polyhydrfo alcohols.Solvent soluble sulfates or tulfonates, such as the.alkaline earth Salts or amine salts c,t alkyl benzenesulfonates and the fatty alcohol sodium aulfates, having surface active properties can be used as em ulsifiera either alone or in conjunction with an ethylene oxide reaction product. Flowble emulsion concentrates are formulated similarly to the emulsifiable concentrates and include, i n addition to the aboVe Components, water and a stabilizing agent such as a water solu7ble cellulose derivative or a water soluble salt of a polyacrylic acid. The concentration of the active ingredient in emulsifiable concentrates of usually abut 10 to 60 by weight and in flowable emulsion concentrates, this can be as high as abut 75 . Wettable powders suitable for spraying, can be prepared by admixing the compound with a finely divided solid, such as clays, inorganic silicates and carbonates, ,and silicas and incorporating wetting agents, Sticking agents, and ot dispersing agents in such mixture. The Coheeht ration of active ingredients in such formulations is usually in the range of about 20 to 98 by weight, preferably bout 401 to 75 . A dispersing gent may generally cnstitute about 0.5 to about 3 by weight of the composition, and a wetting agent may generally constitute from about 0.1 to about 5 by weight of the composition. Dusts can be prepared by mixing the compounds of the invention with finely divided inert solids which may be organic or inorganic in nature. Materials useful for this purpose include, for exdample, botanical flours, silicas. silicates, carbonates and clays. One convenient method of preparing a dust is to dilute a wettable powder with a finely divided carrier. Dust cornentrates containing abut 20 to 808 of the active ingred ent are commonly made and are rubsequently diluted to about 1 to 10 by weight use concentration. Granular formulations can Le prepared by impregnating a solid such as granular Puller s earth, vermiculite, ground corn cobs, reed hulls, including bran or other grain hulls, or similar material. A solution of one or more of the compounds in a volatile organic solvent can be sprayed or mixed with the granular solid and the soslvent then removed by evaporation. The granular material can have any suitable size, with a preferable size range of 16 to 60 mesh. The active compound wAll usually comprise about 2 to 15 by weight of the granular formulations. Saits of the compounds of the invention can be formulated and applied as aqueous solutions. The salt will typically comprise about 0.05 to about 50 by weight preferably about 0.1 to about 10t, of. the solution. These compositions can also be further diluted with water if desired prior to actual application. In some applications, the activity of these compositions can be enhnced by incorporating into the composition an adjuvant such as glycerin, methylethylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, polyoxyethylenesorbitan monooleate, polypropylene glycol, polyacrylic acid, polyethylene sodium malate, polyethylene oxide, or the like. Such adjuvants will generally comprise about 0.1 to about 5 by weight, preferably about 0.5 to about 2 , of the composition. Such compositions can also optionally include an agronomically acceptable surfactant. The compounds of the invention can be applied as sprays by methods commonly employed, such as conventional hydraulic sprays, aerial sprays, and dusts. For low volume applications, a solution of the compound is usually used.The dilution and volume of application will usually depend upon such factors as the type of equipment employed, the method of application, the area to be treated and the type and state of development of the crop being treated. The following is a typical tank mix formulation for the faliar application of sodium l ethyl 6 methyl 2 4 chlorophenyl 4 oxonicotinate on winter wheat at a dose of 0.28 kg ha 0.25 lbs A active ingredient 0 .i134 kg 0.25 lbs of oxonicotinate salt 0.568 1 1 pint of Triton AG 98 dilute to 189.25 1 50 US gals with water.This mixture is then foliar spray applied to the wheat plants at a rate of 467.5 1 he 50 US gals A . The following data illustrate the chemical growth regulating activity of the compounds of the invent ion. In Tables IV to XII which follow the symbol D indicates a dose of 8.968 kg ha 8 lb acre of active ingredient and the symbols D 2 etc. mean that the doses were progressively halved so that D 2 4.484 kg ha 4 lb acre etc. to D 256 0.035 kg ha 1 32 lb acre . Grotth Regulating The following procedures are used to evaluate the activity of the compounds of the invention for inducing male sterility in cereals. An awned variety Fielder and an awnless variety Mayo 64 of spring wheat are planted at the rate of 6 to 8 seeds per 15.24 cm 6 inch diameter pot containing a sterile medium of 3 parts soil and 1 part humus. The plants are grown under short day 9 hour conditions for the first 4 weeks to obtain good vegetative growth before flower initiation. The plants are then moved to long day 16 hour conditions which are provided by thigh intensity lights in the greenhouse. The plants are fertilized at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after panting with a water soluble fertilizer 16 25 16 by weight NPK at the rate of 1.3 ml l 1 teaspoon US gal of water, and are frequently sprayed with Isotox benzenehexachloride for aphid control and dusted with sulfur for powdery mildew control. Test compounds are foliarly applied to the awned female plants when these plants reach the flag leaf emergence stage stage 8 on Feekes scale W. Feekes,Vers 17 Tech Tarwe Comm, Groningen, pp 560 561, 1941 .All compounds are applied in a carrier water volume of 467.5 1 ha 50 US gal A containing the surfactant TritonX 100 at the rate of 567 g 189.25 1 20 oz 50 US gal . After spike emergence but before anthesis, 4 to 6 spikes per pot are bagged to prevent outcrossing. At the first signs of flower opening,.two spikes per pot are cross pollinated, using the approach method, with the awnless male parent. As soon as the seeds become plainly visible, spike length is measured and seeds per spikelet mounted in both bagged and crossed spikes. Male sterility can then be calculated as percent inhibition of seed set in bagged spikes of treated plants, and female fertility in crossed spikes can be calculated as percent of control seed set. After maturity the seed on crossed spikes are planted for determination of percent hybridization. Percent sterility, percent fertility, and percent height inhibition are calculated from the following formulas a. Sterility Sc S1 Sc X 100 Sc seeds spikelet in bagged spikes of control plants. St seeds spikelet bagged spikes of treated plants. b. Fertility Ft Fc x 100 Ft seeds spikelet in approach crossed spikes of treated plants Fc seeds spikelet in unbagged spikes of control plants c. Height inhibition Hc H t Hc . x 100 Hc Height of control plants Ht Height of treated plants Table IV summarizes typical results obtained in the evaluation of representative compounds of the invention.A dash in this and the following tables indicates that no determination of value was made.

Other crops upon which compounds of the present invention have been shown to be effective are maize and barley. The following procedures are used to evaluate the activity of the compounds of this invention for inducing male sterility in maize. Four rows of inbred variety B 73 are interplanted with two rows of inbred variety Mo 17. Both lines are planted at a rate of 20000 seeds 0.4047 ha 20,000 seeds A .The chemicals of this invention are applied to varietyB 73 several weeks later when the last leaf of the plant is just beginning to elongate and the tassel is approximately one inch 2.5 cm long and not yet branched. All treatments are applied with a hand held pressurized sprayer equipped with a 3 nozzle boom containing D3 disc 45 core Tee Jet cone spray tips. Each nozzle is directed at the row with one placed on either side and over the row.Triton X 100 surfactant at 0.093 by weight is added as a surfactant. Dose and carrier volume calculations are based on rows 91.44 cm 36 inches wide. Pollinating ability of treated plants is measured by crossing their pollen onto silks of untreated plants and recording the amount of seed set.

Broadly, the compounds of the invention find applications as plant gr.owth.regulating agents by a method which involves regulating the growth of a monocotyledonous crop plant by applying to the. growing plant, or to seeds thereof, a growth re.gulating amount of one or more of the compounds in question. The preferred application is that of producing hybrid seed by the use of the compounds as selective male sterilants whereby either hybrid seed of enhanced commercial value is thus directly obtained or hybrid seed is obtained which is of utility in plant breeding programmes.In one application of the compounds as chemical hybridizing agents, hybrid seed of a gramineous plant is produced by applying one or more of the compounds to the seeds of the plant, or to the foliage of the plant prior to meiosis, whereby male sterility is induced without destruction of female fertility. The thus treated plant is then pollinated with pollen from a male parent of a different gramineous plant and which is such as to yield the desired hybrid seeds. The pollinated plant is then allowed to mature until seed formation and mature hybrid seeds are collected. Such a method for the production of hybrid seed may involve charging to a container or mechanical dissemination device a hybridization composition containing one or more compounds of the invention and an agronomically acceptable carrier therefor. The thus charged container or mechanical dissemination device is then used to apply the hybridization composition to the plant or seeds thereof, eg. by the application of a dust or liquid spray to the seeds or plant foliage or by immersing the seeds ina liquid hybridization composition in the container. For the agricultural production of ergot by infecting a gramineous plant with ergot spores, allowing the sclerotia to develop and harvesting the mature ergot sclerotia, the method involves applying to the plant prior to infection with the ergot spores at least one compound of the invention in an amount effective to produce significant male sterility in the plant.
