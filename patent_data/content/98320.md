# Apparatus and method for counting a plurality of objects.

## Abstract
An apparatus for counting stacked sheet like materials having low or ambiguous contrast characteristics asso ciated with their edges. A single non pitch matched sensor 102 is used to synthesize sensor output data that is the equivalent of that generated by pitch matched single or plural sensors. Automatic correction for errors in pitch match or sensor and automatic velocity determination are provided. Sensor signal synthesis is accomplished through use of a multiple output tap analog delay line 128 function ing as a discrete time processor.
