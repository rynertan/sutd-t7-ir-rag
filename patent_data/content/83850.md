# Monolith extrusion die construction method.

## Abstract
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a monolith extrusion die 10 is formed by separate ly drilling matching feed holes 16 16 for extruded material in each of two plates 22, 24. In one plate 22 the feed holes 16 are shallow and carefully drilled for accurate alignment with the extrusion slots 12 of the die. In the other plate 24, the holes 16 are accurately located at the drill entry point, but thereafter rapidly drilled without regard to drift. The plates 22, 24 are then bonded together to form the die 10. Other methods of forming an extrusion die using two plates are disclosed.
