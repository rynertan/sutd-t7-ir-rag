# Lens applied optical fibre connectors.

## Abstract
In the connector each fibre 9, 9 or 1, 1 to be connected is inserted into an axial hole 21 in a sleeve 10 or 3 in Figure 8 . The two sleeves are inserted into opposite ends of an adapter 20 so that end surfaces of the sleeves are face to face. At the end surface of each sleeve 3 a lens holder 7 , holding an optical connecting lens 4 , and a guard ring 8 are provided. The lens holder 7 and guard ring 8 project beyond the lens 4 to protect the lens 4 . The optical connecting lenses 4 or 2, 2 are spherical lenses with focal distances between 0.09 mm and 0.27 mm. The lenses 4 are spaced from the ends of the optical fibres 1 by the focal distance. The end face of an optical fivre 1 can be cut at an angle Ï‘ to compensate for axial deflection Y between the optical axis of the fibre 1 and the centre line of the adapter 20 . The sleeves 10 are made of sintered alumina. The sleeves 10 or the adapter 20 are provided with an air escape groove 35 .
