# SHEET REGISTRATION AND FEEDING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A document printer includes sheet feeding apparatus 20 for sequentially presenting both faces of a print receiving sheet to a print station. According to a preferred embodiment, such apparatus features, as part of the duplex sheet path, reversible sheet feeding 32 means operable in first or se cond active modes for selectively feeding sheets into and out of a chute 34 , located upstream from the feeding means, to reverse the sheet s lead edge trail edge orientation. Such sheet feeding means is also operable in a passive mode in which it allows sheets to advance, without substantial interfe rence, downstream therepast to a registration position. Con trol means LCU are provided for switching the feeditig me ans from one of its active modes to its passive mode after a sheet has been advanced into the reversing chute to the ex tent that the sheet buckles, whereupon the restoring force in the sheet propels the leading edge of the sheet past the feed means 32 and into engagement with a registration gate 30 located at the registration position.
