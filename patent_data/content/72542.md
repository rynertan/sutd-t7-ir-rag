# ADAPTIVE EQUALIZER

## Abstract
The dispersive effects of frequency selective fading in a digital, FM, or AM radio system are reduced by means of an adaptive equalizer 11 comprising a cascade of feed forward stages 1,2, ... N , each of which includes a first parallel wavepath 1 1, 1 2, ... 1 N including a first adjustable attenuator 20 1, 20 2, ... 20 N , a second parallel wavepath 2 1, 2 2, ... 2 N including a second adjustable attenuator 21 1, 21 2, ... 21 N and delay means 22 1, 22 2, ... 22 N and means 23 1, 23 2, ... 23 N for combining the signals in said wavepaths and for coupling said combined signal to the next stage. By a suitable selection of parameters, according to two unique relationships, a transfer function can be realized which can compensate for amplitude and delay distortions caused by minimum and nonminimum phase fades.
