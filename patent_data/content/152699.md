# An antithrombogenic polyurethane polymer and a process for imparting antithrombogenic activity to a polyurethane substrate.

## Abstract
There is disclosed an antithrombogenic polyurethane polymer which comprises a polyurethane substrate a polymeric amine covalently bonded to the polyure thane substrate and an antithrombogenic agent wherein the polymeric amine is chosen from a polyvinyl amine, a polyalkylenimine which has 2, 3 or 4 carbon atoms per amine unit, and mixtures thereof. A process for imparting antithrombogenic activity to a polyurethane substrate is also disclosed.
