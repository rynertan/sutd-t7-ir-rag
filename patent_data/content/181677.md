# Improved ultrasonic image storage device and method.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic imaging system for medical diagnostic purposes is provided. A first digital signal representative of a video input signal is provided. The first digital signal comprises a series of digital amplitude samples of the transverse component of the input signal. A second series of samples is provided from the first series. Each element of the second series is the arithmetic average of a group of elements of the first series. The second digital signal series is compressed to form a third digital signal series, the third digital signal series being stored. The compressing provides a third digital signal which is a non linear function of the second digital signal such that the granularity of the stored signal is increased in regions of high diagnostic interest at the expense of decreased resolution in areas of low diagnostic interest. When it is desired to display the stored digital image, the third digital signal is retrieved from the storage means 18 and expanded to provide the reconstituted second digitial signal which is thereafter directed to a video display 120 .
