# Atomizer nozzle assembly.

## Abstract
An atomizing noszle comprises at least two nozzle heads 10 arranged in particular relation to each other. Each of the nozzle heads 10 has a discharge port 19 through which a simple jet of liquid drops are jetted. These nozzle heads 10 are so arranged that the respective longitudinal axes Y Y of these nozzle heads 10 intersect at a predetermined angle 20 with each other while each of the discharge ports 19 is spaced a predetermined distance from the point A of intersection of these longitudinal axes Y Y .
