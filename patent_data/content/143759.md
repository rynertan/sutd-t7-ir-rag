# ANALYZING PROBE

## Abstract
The present invention briefly refers to a device and a method for analyzing samples of molten charges inside the charges themselves. An analyzing probe 1 comprising a body 4 of ceramic material with an inlet for molten charge is provided in a tube 5 of board or the like and forms a disposable probe. A cavity 2a is provided in the ceramic body 4 and the inlet 3 has a notch or the like towards the cavity for receiving molten charge. An electrode 10 is posi tioned in the cavity 2a and upon application of electric cur rent via the electrode 10 and the molten charge spark or a luminous arc is ignited between the electrode 10 and the portion of the sample of the molten charge adjacent the notch. A light conducting body 8 is provided in the cavity adjacent the luminous arc or sparks for collecting light emit ted therefrom.
