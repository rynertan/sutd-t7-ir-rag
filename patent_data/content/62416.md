# Contact positioning apparatus.

## Abstract
The contact positioning apparatus comprises a plu rality of contact holding portions 11, 11 adapted to receive a series of contacts at a first pitch and to deliver the contacts to a second, different pitch. The portions 11, 11 are arranged in spaced parallel co planar relation and are supported from a carriage 19 on respective cranks 13, 14 individually rotatable by respective pinions 16, 16 . Arms 13, 13 of the cranks are of progressively increased length and means 55, 23 provide for bringing the pinions 16, 16 into en gagement with a common rack 27 , traversable to rotate the cranks and bring the contact holding portions to the desired different pitch. The carriage is suitably sup ported on an XYZ positioning mechanism to move the contacts between receiving and discharge stations.
