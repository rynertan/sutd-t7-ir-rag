# Package for semiconductor device and method for its production.

## Abstract
A package for a semi conductor device comprises three laminated ceramic sheets 12, 16, 19 . A first sheet 12 is provided with a chip stage 11 on its upper surface. A second sheet 16 is provided with a first chip inserting window 14 exposing the surface of the chip stage 11 and is provided with an internal conductor pattern 13 formed at least on its upper surface. A third sheet 19 is provided with a second window 17 exposing the first chip inserting window 14 and exposing a wire bonding area WB located adjacent to the periphery of the first chip inserting window 14 . During manufacture 15a, 15b marks for recognizing the location of the first chip inserting window 14 and the first chip inserting window 14 are simultaneously formed with the same mold, the marks for recognizing the location of the first chip inserting window being formed in the wire bonding area of the second green sheet. 16 .
