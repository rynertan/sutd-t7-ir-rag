# Fabric washing process and detergent composition for use therein.

## Abstract
Particulate detergent compositions, especially for use in cold water, contain a detergent active material, an alkaline material and builder particles comprising a carrier material and a saturated fatty acid having at least 16 carbon atoms. The carrier material is water soluble or water dispersible to release the fatty acid when the composition is added to a wash liquor. The builder particles have a size of 50 to 5000 microns. Suitable materials include starch, clay, silica and inorganic salts the fatty acid may be in solid solution with a dispersant such as a nonionic surfactant. When the alkaline material in carbonate, the addition of the builder particles to the wash liquor may be delayed until after a critical state is reached.
