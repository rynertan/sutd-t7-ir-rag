# Printed circuit lead carrier tape.

## Abstract
Tape 20 has apertures 26 into each of which extend leads 22 for attachment to bonding pads 30 of integrated circuit 28. To strengthen the leads and hold them in position for bonding they areintegral with a frame 32 within which is an integral pull tab 33. After bonding the tab 33 is pulled, breaking the frame at neck 34 and successively breaking links 35 which connect the frame to the leads. The leads are then cut away from the edge of the aperture 26 and bonded at 31 to further connectors.
