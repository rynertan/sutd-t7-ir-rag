## Description
The present invention relates to an apparatus for optically writing information of the kind referred to in the precharacterizing portion of patent claim 1. Such an apparatus is known from JP A 57 130240. As an optical disc capable of recording and playback, there is known one in which a recording film provided on a substrate is formed with minute pits by heating and vaporizing very small parts by means of a laser beam. In the recording of the optical disc of this type, when add on recording is desired, it needs to be performed while a spacing from a track already recorded is held exactly constant. In particular, there is a case where the disc is once taken off after several tracks have been recorded on a part of the disc and where the add on recording is to be performed anew. In this case, the eccentric magnitude of the disc is usually as large as 100 µm, and the track pitch is about 1.6 µm. Therefore, a track add on recorded anew crosses several tens of tracks already recorded, and accurate recording becomes impossible. In order to cope with this situation, an optical disc has been proposed on which an optically detectable guide groove is previously formed so as to record and play back information along the guide groove. Refer to, for example, JP A 58 91536 corresponding to U.S. Serial No. 443,399 . As to the optical disc of this type, a severe dimensional accuracy of the guide groove is required in order to secure the signal to noise ratio of a playback signal at a predetermined value. There has also been proposed an apparatus which forms two laser beams and performs add on writing by employing one of the laser beams for the tracking playback of recording tracks already bearing information already recorded tracks and the other for the recording. With this system, since the two laser beams are focused on a record carrier via individual optical systems, two beam spots are very difficult of stably holding a fixed distance on the record carrier, and the distance between them fluctuates due to any slight positional deviation of the individual optical systems. It is, in effect, impossible to measure the distance between both the beam spots, and even the overlap of the two can occur due to a fluctuation in a track interval. JP A 57 130240 discloses an apparatus comprising a record carrier having a circular disc shaped substrate provided thereon with a recording layer capable of optically writing information therein and in which a plurality of circumferential reference tracks extending in the rotating direction of said record carrier are disposed at radial intervals, each of said reference tracks being constructed into an optically detectably structure so as to function as on optical guide for enabling recording of information at least between adjacent reference tracks an objective lens for condensing first and second light beams and for focusing said first and second light beams on said recording layer of said record carrier respectively optical detection means for detecting the intensity of said first light beam from said recording layer means for deriving from the output of said optical detection means a tracking signal for controlling impingement positions of both said first and second light beams in a direction traversing the track direction tracking means for causing said first light beam to follow one of said reference tracks in response to the tracking signal light diffraction means for moving said second light beam on said recording layer of said recorded carrier in the radial direction thereof and means to modulate the intensity of said second light beam in response to information to be recorded so that said second light beam writes information as information tracks between said reference tracks while one of said reference tracks is followed by said first light beam, said information tracks having radial intervals of said predetermined pitch therebetween. US A 3 801 824 discloses the use of an acusto optic diffractor for shifting one beam from track to track. In view of such drawbacks, the present invention provides an apparatus which can successively write data into tracks while track intervals are held exactly constant by eliminating the influences of an eccentric magnitude etc. This object is accomplished with an apparatus as claimed in claim 1. Dependent claims are directed on freatures of preferred embodiments of the invention. Fig. 1 is a plan view showing an example of a record carrier 10 for use in the present invention. It also shows a preferable example of reference guide tracks 11⁰ and the sectional structure of the record carrier. The upper surface of this record carrier is formed with the concentric reference guide tracks 11⁰ in large numbers at predetermined intervals in the radial direction thereof. Data items to be written by a user are recorded on tracks 11¹, 11², within recording areas c indicated by arrows between the reference guide tracks 11⁰, while holding fixed track pitches relative to the reference guide tracks at all times. For the sake of brevity, two of the reference guide tracks are exaggeratedly shown in Fig. 1. In actuality, the reference guide tracks are provided in a number of about 1500 at intervals of 48 µm in a region from an inside radius of 7 cm to an outside radius of 14 cm by way of example assuming, the pitches of the data recording tracks 11¹, 11², to be 1.6 µm, data corresponding to 29 revolutions can be recorded in each interspace between the reference guide tracks . The number of tracks which can be added on for one reference guide track 11⁰ is determined by the performance of a light diffracter which is used in a recording playback apparatus. For example, in case of using an acousto optic diffracter, up to about 100 tracks can be readily recorded subject to the track pitches being 1.6 µm. In addition, although the data recording tracks 11¹, 11², have been exemplified as concentric circles in Fig. 1, it is to be understood that they may well be recorded spirally. In the present invention, each reference guide track 11⁰ is divided into a large number of e. g., 64 sectors 301, 302, and 364. Each of the sectors 301, 302, and 364 has an address portion 30 in which an address for identifying the reference guide track is recorded, a sector address portion 31 in which an address for appointing the corresponding sector is recorded, and a synchronous portion 32 in which synchronizing signals to be used for recording information on the tracks 11¹, 11², are recorded. The reference guide track 11⁰ is used as optical guide when recording information on and or playing it back from the tracks 11¹, 11², , so that it needs to be optically detectable. The recording area c is provided with a recording layer of a material which gives rise to an optically detectable change when irradiated with a light beam for example, laser beam . By way of example, the reference guide track 11⁰ is constructed of an array of minute pits formed in the substrate 10A of the record carrier, and the whole front surface of the record carrier can be coated with a recording layer 10B of a highly reflective material whose reflection coefficient can be controlled by irradiation with a light beam. Effectively used as the recording layer 10B is, for example, a metal layer such as of Te Se which is melted when locally irradiated with a laser beam of high intensity, an amorphous layer such as of TeO A record carrier is prepared wherein the whole front surface of a flat substrate is coated with, for example, a highly reflective recording layer whose reflection coefficient can be controlled by a light beam, and a large number of reference guide tracks 11⁰ are formed as concentric circles at predetermined intervals before the user writes data. In this case, in the record carrier obtained, the information items of the reference guide tracks are recorded in the same form as that of the information to be recorded by the user. By way of example, the record carrier of the present invention may be provided with one reference guide track for 30 recording tracks. As regards a disc 30 cm in diameter and 1800 r. p. m. in speed, accordingly, the period of time for initialization having heretofore been 30 minutes decreases to 1 30 and becomes approximately 1 minute in accordance with the present invention. Next, there will be described a record carrier which can record data with the recording pit length set at a fixed value irrespective of the position of the recording radius In order to record information on or play it back from the record carrier of the construction as shown in Fig. 1 or Fig. 2, a recording playback apparatus is required in which the two sorts of light beams of a tracking light beam for precisely controlling the position of the data track along the reference guide track and a light beam for writing and reading data can be simultaneously emitted in a predetermined positional relationship. Fig. 3 is a diagram showing an embodiment of such information recording playback apparatus. Referring to the figure, a light source 2 is modulated by a signal source 1, and the modulated light beam 2A thereof is supplied to an optical system. A semiconductor laser, for example, is used as the light source. A coupling lens 3 converts the modulated light beam 2A into a parallel beam, which enters a light diffracter 4. An acousto optic diffracter A O light diffracter is used as the light diffracter 4. As illustrated in Fig. 4, two sorts of ultrasonic waves at frequencies ν Next, there will be explained a method according to which, while holding their spacings from the reference guide tracks 11⁰ or n⁰ exactly constant as illustrated in Fig. 1, the light spots 8 and 9 sequentially record the data tracks 11¹, 11², 11³, 11⁴, at equal pitches anew. The output signals of a base frequency oscillator 15 and a variable frequency oscillator 16 are added by an adder 17, and the added signal 18 is amplified by an amplifier 19. The amplified signal 12 is applied to the light diffracter 4. The base frequency oscillator 15 is composed of a regulated voltage source 25 and a voltage frequency converter 26 2. The variable frequency oscillator 16 is composed of a variable micro voltage source 27, an adder 28 1 and a voltage frequency converter 26 1. An acousto optic diffracter A O light diffracter is employed as the light diffracter. When the frequency ν is applied as the input signal of the A O diffracter, the light beam is diffracted by the angle ϑ. Now, the output from the variable frequency oscillator 16 is considered as the input to the A O diffracter, and the waveform thereof is assumed to be a stepped waveform or a triangular waveform as shown in Fig. 5 a or 5 b . Here, Fig. 5 a corresponds to the recording of concentric circle tracks, and Fig. 5 b the recording of spiral tracks. Hereinbelow, the recording of the concentric circle tracks in Fig. 5 a will be referred to. The diffraction angle of the light beam is given by where ν The output of the photodetector 13 is also supplied to a processing circuit 35 to read the address information and the synchronizing signals recorded on the reference guide track, and the read data items are used for controlling the signal source 1 and the variable frequency oscillator 16. Further, if necessary, they are used for the rotational control of a motor 36 for rotating the record carrier 10 of Fig. 2 in case of using this record carrier by way of example. On this occasion, the positions P⁰ t and P t of the light spot 9 of the base frequency and the light spot 8 of the variable frequency on the disc surface are respectively expressed by the following equations There will now be explained the signal Δν t in the case of recording signals along the tracks 11¹, 11², 11³, on the disc 10 anew as the tracking state is held. The difference of Eqs. 5 and 6 becomes Letting λ denote the wavelength of the light beam and V where Accordingly, in order to set the interval between the light spots 8 and 9 at integral times of the track pitch of 1.6 µm, namely, at 1.6 x n n 1, 2, N µm by way of example, the variable frequency of the oscillator 16 may be varied by In the embodiment, the tracking control has been explained as being performed in such a way that the objective lens 5 is moved by applying the tracking error signal 20 to the driver circuit 21 and thus driving the actuator 22. The tracking control, however, may well be performed in such a way that an adder 28 2 is provided on the output side of the regulated voltage source 25 as shown by dotted lines in Fig. 3 and that the frequency to be applied to the light diffracter 4 is controlled according to the tracking error signal 20 by adding the voltage from the regulated voltage source 25 and the tracking error signal 20. In the foregoing, the tracking control has been performed in such a way that the light diffracter 4 or the actuator 22 mounted on the objective lens 5 is driven by the tracking error signal, it can also be performed with optical path modification means such as a movable transparent or reflective member. Such examples will be described with reference to Figs. 6 to 9. Fig. 6 is a schematic arrangement diagram of a recording playback apparatus, Fig. 7 is an explanatory diagram illustrative of the operation of an A O diffracter for use in the apparatus, Fig. 8 is an explanatory diagram illustrative of the operation of a beam shifter, and Fig. 9 is a side view showing the drive mechanism of the beam shifter. Light emitted from a semiconductor laser 2 is collimated into a parallel beam by an optical system such as lens 3, and the parallel beam enters a light diffracter A O diffracter 4. As illustrated in Fig. 7, one sort of ultrasonic wave at a frequency ν is applied to the A O light diffracter 4. In consequence, the incident light 2A is split into the two beams of zero order light 4a and first order light 4c which inclines by an angle ϑ or so with respect to the former. The parallel beams of the zero order light 4a and the first order light 4c enter a beam shifter 71. As shown in Fig. 8, the beam shifter 71 is a transparent glass plate which has a thickness Accordingly, the beam shift magnitude Assuming by way of example that the thickness As shown in Fig. 9, turning shafts 72, 72 are respectively connected to both the ends of the beam shifter 71 in the longitudinal direction thereof. One turning shaft 72 is journaled in a bearing 73, while the other turning shaft 72 is coupled to the rotor not shown of a pulse motor 74. Accordingly, the inclination angle of the beam shifter 71 can be adjusted stepwise by energizing the pulse motor 74. The zero order light 4a and first order light 4c stated before permeate through the beam shifter 71 thereby to have the positions of the beams shifted simultaneously, and then pass through a semitransparent mirror or beam splitter prism 24, to form two light spots on a disc 10 via an objective lens 5. The zero order light 4a is for tracking and therefore forms the light spot on the reference guide track 11⁰ or n⁰ of the optical disc 10, while the first order light 4c is for writing or reading and therefore forms the light spot on the data track. Light reflected by the surface of the optical disc 10 has its optical path bent by the semitransparent mirror or beam splitter prism 24, and is focused on the light receiving face of a photodetector 13 by an optical system 80. Tracking information obtained with the photodetector 13 is applied as a feedback signal to the pulse motor 74 through a control portion not shown , and is converted into the rotational angle of the beam shifter 71. In case of shifting the tracking light spot of the zero order light 4a onto the adjacent reference guide track, it can be immediately moved by altering the inclination angle Fig. 10 is a schematic arrangement diagram of a recording playback apparatus according to another embodiment of the present invention. The main point of this embodiment differing from the embodiment of Fig. 6 is that a reflector 75 is used in lieu of the beam shifter 71 and is advanced rectilinearly or turned every predetermined movement value. More specifically, the zero order light 4a and the first order light 4c having emerged from the A O light diffracter 4 are reflected by the reflector 75 and are passed through the semitransparent mirror or beam splitter prism 24 as well as the objective lens 5. When, as described above, the reflector 75 is advanced rectilinearly or turned to change its position, the incident positions of the zero order light 4a and first order light 4c upon the objective lens 5 change, and the tracking in the next area is performed on the optical disc 10. For example, a linear pulse motor, an electromagnetic solenoid or a torsion vibrator is employed as drive means for rectilinearly advancing or turning the reflector 75. In the embodiment of Fig. 6 or the embodiment of Fig. 10, when the frequency ν to be applied to the A O light diffracter 4 is controlled to f₁ Δf₁ in correspondence with the particular data track position as illustrated in Fig. 5 a or 5 b , the light spot can be set at a desired data track position. The utilization efficiency of light is favorable in the case where, as in these embodiments, the A O light diffracter is used as beam division means for dividing one parallel beam into a plurality of beams, thereby to divide the parallel beam into zero order light and first order light, so as to employ the zero order light for tracking and the diffracted first order light for writing or reading.
