## Description
The present invention relates to nuclear magnetic resonance NMR sample investigation and, more particularly, to method and apparatus for the inversion of the magnetization by non linear adiabatic fast passage AFP to minimize the radio frequency RF power dissipated in the sample to be investigated. Many NMR techniques, such as inversion recovery, spin echo and the like which may be utilized to provide a human viewable image of a sample, require the inversion of the magnetization M vector. NMR magnetization inversion is usually achieved by application of a 180 , or a π radian, RF pulse at the NMR resonance, or Larmor, frequency. However, use of a 180 inverting pulse requires a high degree of homogeneity in both the static magnetic field and the RF magnetic field if relatively low distortion of the final image is to be generated. It is well known that the magnetization vector inversion technique called adiabatic fast passage AFP can generally produce magnetization inversion which is much less sensitive to inhomogeneity in either or both of the main static magnetic field B₀ or the RF magnetic field B₁. The AFP inversion technique applies a strong RF pulse while sweeping either the static magnetic field magnitude B₀ or the RF field instantaneous frequency ω linearly through resonance while meeting the condition, first described by Bloch in 1946, that Document J. Chem. Phys. 79 9 1 NOVEMBER 1983, pages 4643, 4644 Broadband population inversion by phase modulated pulses J. Baum et al., describes a method for producing a complete inversion by adiabatic fast passage using a nonlinear sweep of the radiofrequency field. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide novel method and apparatus for obtaining complete inversion of the magnetization, in NMR apparatus having at least potential inhomogeneity in at least one of the main static magnetic field and radio frequency magnetic field, utilizing a non linear adiabatic fast passage frequency sweep. In accordance with the present invention, a method and apparatus, respectively, for complete inversion of magnetization by adiabatic fast passage during an NMR experiment on a sample having a nuclear specie with a Larmor frequency ω₀, comprises the provisions as claimed in claims 1 and 6, respectively. Preferred embodiments of the invention are claimed in the subclaims. Further embodiments and other objects of the present invention will become apparent upon a reading of the following detailed description, when considered in conjunction with the drawings. Referring initially to Figure 1a, the total effective magnetic field When the AFP inversion sweep commences, the RF magnetic field vector Referring now to Figure 1b, one form of apparatus 10 for providing the adiabatic fast passage inversion frequency sweep provides a substantially constant amplitude, linearly changing swept frequency RF signal at an output 10a, to an RF excitation amplifier and antenna not shown for reasons of simplicity which forms a portion of a magnetic resonance imaging system. In the prior art, a ramp generator 11 generates a substantially linear ramp voltage signal V The substantially linear AFP sweep magnetization inversion method of the prior art is thus summarized in Figure 2a, wherein time t is plotted along abscissa 26 and frequency Referring now to Figure 2b, wherein elapsed sweep time t We have found that the use of a highly non linear tangential frequency sweep is considerably more power efficient than the substantially linear frequency sweep hitherto utilized for adiabatic fast passage inversion of the magnetization vector. We restate the Bloch condition, in slightly different form, as We have also found that, by restating the equation 5 Bloch condition as Referring now to Figure 3b, the magnitude of the Z axis magnetization M The second form tangential RF sweep, wherein Referring now to Figure 4a, the final Z axis magnetization M Referring now to Figure 4b, the final Z axis magnetization value M Figure 4c illustrates a comparison between predicted and actual results obtained in an NMR imaging system. A small vial phantom was placed in the main static magnetic field B₀ of the NMR system and an inversion recovery pulse sequence was run, with the response signal from the nuclei of the material in the phantom vial being read out immediately after inversion, so that the response signal amplitude was a direct measure of the completeness of Z axis magnetization inversion. The amplitude of the inverting pulse was varied to produce errors in the RF magnetic field B₁ amplitude. In this Figure, wherein the final magnetization value M Figure 4d illustrates the effect of a main static magnetic field B₀ error, approximated by offsetting the frequency ω₀ of the inverting pulse by a known amount Δω₀. Final Z axis magnetization magnitude M Magnetization inversion by a non linear, tangential frequency sweep for adiabatic fast passage will provide essentially complete magnetization inversion in an inversion time interval on the same order of magnitude as the time interval required for a 180 RF π pulse magnetization inversion, and will be considerably less sensitive to inhomogeneities or changes in the main static magnetic field B₀ and or RF magnetic field B₁. While several presently preferred embodiments of our novel non linear tangential adiabatic fast passage frequency sweep for magnetization inversion have been described in detail herein, many modifications and variations will now become apparent to those skilled in the art. As one example, the linear ramp generator means can now be subject to modification to provide a non linear ramp signal having the desired first or second tangential form. Similarly, it is within the scope of our novel AFP inversion frequency sweeps to have any sweep beginning at a higher frequency
