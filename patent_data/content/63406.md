# A power supply circuit.

## Abstract
A power supply and buffer circuit 10 for a temperature control system has an input side switchable between a low input impedance mode 30 and a high input impedance mode 40 . The power supply and buffer circuit 10 in both of these states provides a power output for a temperature monitoring device such as one including logic elements. The power supply and buffer circuit 10 forms an interface between the temperature monitoring device and the remain der of the temperature control system so that a temperature monitoring device and a power supply and buffer circuit 10 directly replaces a conventional bimetallic switch type thermostat and then the power supply and buffer circuit looks to the rest of the system just like the replaced bimetallic switch and yet in all states the power supply and buffer circuit 10 provides a power output for the temperature monitoring device.
