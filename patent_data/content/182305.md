# Read only memory.

## Abstract
This read only memory comprises a plurality of memory cells 1,1 . . . N, M arranged in an array having N rows and M columns and consisting essentially of a single transistor, N word lines WL1 . . . WLN , each connected to the base of the transistors of said M memory cells in a discrete one of said N rows of memory cells M bit lines BL1 . . . BLM , each associated with N memory cells 1,1 . . . N,M in a discrete one of said M columns of memory cells, at least one of said M bit lines BL1 . . . BLM being connected to one or more of the emitters of the transistors of said M associated memory cells of said one, or more bit line BL1 . . . BLM . The read only memory further comprises a bit line bleeder current generator T6 . . . T9, R2 . . . R4 connected to said M bit lines BL1 . . . BLM and maintaining a constant current in at least certain ones of said bit lines BL1 . . . BLM , a controllable read circuit T1 . . . T5, R1 connected to said N word lines WL1 . . . WLN and M bit lines BL1 . . . BLM for reading at least any predetermined one of said M x N array of memory cells, a sense amplifier T13 . . . T15, R5 . . . R8, SD1 for electrically manifesting the binary bit stored in the predetermined one of said M x N array of memory cells being read, and an isolation circuit T10 . . . T12 interconnecting said sense amplifier and said M x N array of memory cells 1,1 . . . N, m and reducting the capacitive impedance load on said sense amplifier T 13 . . . T15, R5 . . . R8, SD1 , whereby the read time of a read operation is materially reducted and the electrical manifestation is materially enhanced.
