## Description
DESCRIPTION A BRIDGE TYPE CO ORDINATE MEASUItlNG MACHINE. This invention relates to a bridge type co ordinate measuring machine CMM for measuring the dimensions of a workpiece. A bridge type co ordinate measuring machine is generally comprised of a base, a bridge moveably mounted to the base, a carriage moveably mounted to the upper portion of the bridge, a probe moveably mounted to the carriage and a measuring and computation system that responds to movement of the probe for measuring the dimensions of a workpiece located on the upper surface of the base. Examples of bridge type co ordinate measuring machines may be found in U.S. patents 3,749,501 entitled MeasuringMachine issued July 31, 1973 and 3,840,993 entitled Co ordinate Measuring Machine issued October 15, 1974. The important functions of a co ordinate measuring machine are its accurate measurement and its repeatability i.e. ability to repeat or obtain the same measurement from the same workpiece.In a bridge type co ordinate measuring machine accuracy and repeatability may be adversely affected by vibration and relative movement between the uprights of the bridge. Poor stiffness or rigidity of the bridge permits relative movement between the uprights of the bridge while height, spacing and stiffness all affect resonant frequency, which if low, makes the measuring probe mounted on the bridge more susceptible to vibrations. One approach to minimizing or dampening the effect of vibrations on a CMM has been to mount the CMM on an air bag apparatus or large concrete platform or increase the mass of the bridge uprights. These approaches are expensive, space consuming and only isolate external vibrations i.e., ground vibrations.Internal vibrations e.g., caused by electro mechanical servo mechanisms mounted on the machine, would not be isolated or dampened. One approach to minimizing the effect of relative movement between the bridge uprights is discussed in the 3,749,501 patent where a position indicator is located on each upright. However, this increases the cost for the positional and measurement apparatus of the C and still does not address the problem of an undesirable low resonant frequency that can be present in a bridge structure e.g. a resonant frequency below 20 Hertz can adversely effect the measuring accuracy of a CMM. Another approach to improving the accuracy of aCMM is having a square bridge with a portal. Such a CNM is described in Russian patent 621,955 issuedAugust 30, 1978. Accordingly, the accuracy of the measurements made by a bridge type co ordinate measuring machine may be adversely affected by poor rigidity and vibrations because of a low resonant frequency of the bridge.This is especially true of a bridge type CMM used for measuring large workpieces, such as an automobile body or engine, because of the height and spacing of the uprights of such a bridge e.g. about one to two metres high with one and a half to two and a half metre spacing. The invention is a bridge type coordinate measuring machine that has a closed loop bridge configuration that encircles the upper surface of a measuring machine base upon which a workpiece is placed for measurement and is characterized by a guideway located on each side of the base and bearings dn the bridge that coact upwardly, downwardly and inwardly against the guideways. In one variation of the invention it is preferable to have the lower member of the bridge, that is connected to the uprights, located above the ways on the base, along which the bridge moves. With the lower horizontal connecting member of the bridge above the ways, rather than below the ways, the distance between the upper and lower horizontal bridge members is shortened without changing the work space available between the upper bridge member and the upper surface of the base. This arrangement provides for easy assembly of the bridge onto the base. The machine of the present invention may result in one or more of the following advantages i improvement of the measuring accuracy of a CMM used for measuring large workpieces such as automobile engine blocks and automobile body parts ii improvement of the rigidity of the bridge of a CMM iii reduction in the relative movement between the uprights of the bridge of a CMM, especially when the uprights have a height greater than 1 metre iv lowering of the effect of vibrations on the probe mounted on the bridge of a CMM by increasing the resonant frequency of the bridge v minimizing of the need for an expensive system to isolate the measuring probe of a CMM from external vibrations vi elimination of the sag effect that a heavy workpiece, placed in the upper surface of the base, has upon the ways. The invention will now be further described by way of example, with reference to and as illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which Figures 1 and 2 are perspective views of a bridge type co ordinate measuring machine incorporating the principles of this inv7t2Ã³Snj 9 Figure 3 is a cutaway view of a CMM showing one arrangement of the bridge mounted to the base of a CMM and Figures 4 and 5 are mounting arrangements of the bridge onto the base of a CMM. Referring now to the drawings, Figure 1 illustrates a bridge type co ordinate measuring machine of the type having a base 10, a bridge 20 moveably mounted to the base 10, a carriage 50 moveably mounted to the bridge 20, and a probe 30 moveably mounted tQ the carriage 50. The base 10 includes an upper surface 11 upon which a workpiece not shown to be measured is located, and guideways 12,13. The base 10 is divided into an upper table portion 14 separated from the lower portion by legs 15. Rubber feet 16 at the bottom of the base 10, minimize the effect af external vibrations on theCMM. This arrangement of the guideways 12,13 and legs 15 provides space, if desired, for a motor and suitable drive mechanism for moving the bridge 20 to be located at the centre of the base 10.The bridge 20 includes two uprights 21,22 connected together by an upper member 23 and a lower member 24. Moveably mounted on the upper member 23 of the bridge 20 is a carriage 50 which has moveably mounted thereto a probe shaft 31 having a probe 30 at one end thereof. The probe 30 is generally of the type that, upon contact with a piece to be measured, provides a signal to an appropriate computation and measuring apparatus. One example of such a probe may be found in U.S. Patent 4,270,275 entitled Probes and issued June 6, 1981.The bridge 20 is moveably mounted to the base 10 along guideways 12,13, the surfaces of which interface with bearings 41 mounted in respective channels 25 in the bridge 20. Preferably, air bearings 41 are used to facilitate movement of the bridge 20 along the guideways 12,13 of the base 10. Movement of the bridge, carriage and probe shaft 31 allows the probe to move and take measurements in three dimensions.Electrical or mechanical means responsive to movement of the probe indicate the position of the probe in 3 co ordinates. and, when required, calculate measurements e.g., The Warner and Swasey Company,Sheffield Measurement Division measurement processor model MP3. Figure 2 illustrates how the carriage 50 is moveably mounted to the upper member 23 of the bridge 20 along guideways 26, 27, 28, the surfaces of which interface with bearings 55 in respective channels 51, 52, 53 in the carriage 50. The probe 30 is mounted to the bridge 20 for movement along two axes and is moveable along a third axis by movement of the bridge. Mounting arrangements for the probe and carriage are described in further detail in the 3,749,501 and 3,840,993 patents. Mechanical or preferably air bearings 55 are used to facilitate movement of the carriage 50 relative to the bridge 20. Also shown is the arrangement of the upper and lower bearings 41 of the bridge 20 that coact with the surfaces of one of the guideways 12 of the base 10. Figure 3 illustrates further details of how the air bearings 41, located in channels 25 in the bridge 20, interface with the surfaces ofthe guide ways 12, 13 of the base 10. In this embodiment of the invention, the lower member 24 of the bridge 20 is located below the bearings 41 and below the table portion 14 of the base 10. The upper table portion 14 of the base 10 is supported by only three legs 15.This provides better vibrational and deflectional isolation than would four legs i.e., one in each corner of the table 14. Figure 4 illustrates an alternate embodiment of the invention wherein the bridge 20 has two lower connecting members 24,29 with the bearings 41 coacting with the guideways 12,13 of the base 10 located between the two lower members 24,29 of the bridge 20. Figure 5 illustrates further details of how the air bearings 41, located in channels 25 in the bridge 20, interface with the surfaces of the guide ways 12, 13 of the base 10. In this preferred embodiment, the lower member 24 of the bridge 20 is located above the ways 12,13 and below the table portion 14 of the base io. The upper table portion 14 of the base 10 is suppo rted by only three legs 15. This provides better vibrational and deflectional isolation than would four legs i.e., one in each corner of the table 14.
