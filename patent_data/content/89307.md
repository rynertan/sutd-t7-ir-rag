# A pneumatic tire.

## Abstract
A pneumatic radial passenger tire having a tread portion provided with a pair of tread edges 14 spaced apart axially of the tire, the tread portion being provided with a plurality of main grooves 16 associated with each tread edge spaced circumferentially apart. Each of the main grooves following substantially identical paths axially inwardly and circum ferentially of the tire. Each main groove having an axially outer end 18 which opens outwardly of the tread edge 14 and an axially inner edge 20 which terminates at a distance from its associated tread edge of at least forty percent 40 of the tread width. Each main groove having a first branch 22 and a second branch 24 extending therefrom in a generally opposite circumferential direction from which said main grooves 16 extend. The first branch 22 extends from its main groove 16 towards and terminating in communication with the next circumferentially adjacent groove. Each second branch 24 extends from its main groove 16 past the next circumferentially adjacent main groove towards at least and in close proximity with the second circumferentially adjacent main groove.
