# Terminal generation of dynamically redefinable character sets.

## Abstract
A graphic display terminal is arranged to receive drawing instructions containing the description of a display character. The terminal, under control in dependent of the source, translates each received draw ing instruction into a picture description bit pattern conforming to the characteristics of the terminal display device 7 . The interpreted bits are then stored in a graphic repertory 10 for subsequent retrieval under control of code received from the source. In this man ner dynamically redefinable character sets may be cre ated and used without regard to a particular terminal implementation.
