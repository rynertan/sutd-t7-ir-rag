# Scaffolding.

## Abstract
A modular block is the key component of scaffolding for use in restricted working spaces such as are encountered in the building of coke ovens. The scaffolding comprises a plurality of columns 8 spaced at regular intervals along the length of the working space 9 and each built up from a set of modular blocks 12 to 15 . The modular blocks are preferably of a framed construction, injection moulded from a high density thermoplastic polymer, and structured to give high resistance to crushing. The blocks 12 to 15 of each set are all of the same external transverse horizontal dimensions and each is fashioned at its underside with a depending peripheral flange 16 and at its upper side with an inset peripheral ledge 17 . The modular blocks 12 to 15 of each set differ in flange and ledge widths with the ledge width of each greater than the flange width and the peripheral flange 16 of each upper block 13, 14 and 15 respectively in a column 8 snugly fitting on to the peripheral ledge 17 of the block 12, 13 and 14 respectively immediately therebelow in the column.

## Description
SCAFFOLDING This invention relates to scaffolding, and more especially to scaffolding for use in restricted working spaces such as are encountered in the building of coke ovens. It has hitherto been customary in the building of coke ovens to use scaffolding of the kind comprising spaced parallel skeletal frames made up of two vertical tubular poles or risers interspaced by transverse tubular poles or ledgers, successive frames being mutually tied by cross and diagonal tubular poles bridging therebetween, and a working platform being provided by timber battens supported on corresponding transverse poles or ledgers of the frames. Scaffolding of the kind aforesaid has to be erected by a recognised scaffolding organisation within the limits of their standard products and the adaptability thereof is limited. It can be erected only in lifts or levels dictated by lengths of vertical poles or risers between transverse poles or ledgers of standard frames and building or construction work is interrupted while new lifts or levels are installed. Scaffolding of the kind aforesaid cannot be made totally stable in itself in coke oven constructions, because of therestricted working space, and requires additional shoring to walls by putlogs as they are being built. Moreover, the working platform has to be formed from standard scaffold boards nine inches in width and this frequently leaves a gap within the oven wall space, with a consequent safety problem. The object of the present invention is to provide scaffolding for use in restricted working spaces which does not have the disadvantages implicit in the preceding paragraph of scaffolding of the kind aforesaid. In accordance with the present invention scaffolding for use in a restricted working space is characterized in that the working platform is supported on columns spaced at intervals lengthwise of the restricted working space and each built up from a set of modular blocks all of the same external transverse horizontal dimensions and each fashioned at its underside with a depending peripheral flange and at its upper side with an inset peripheral ledge, the modular blocks of each set dithering in flange and ledge widths with the ledge width of each greater than the flange width and the peripheral flange of each upper block snugly fitting on to the peripheral ledge of the block immediately therebelow in the respective column. An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is a perspective view from above and to one side and end of scaffolding in accordance with the invention Fig. 2 is an end elevation on a smaller scale of the scaffolding of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a transverse vertical sectional view on yet another scale, through the lower part of one of the columns of the scaffolding and Fig. 4 is an end elevation, in the direction of the arrow IV of Fig. 1, looking on to an intermediate column of the scaffolding and showing part of the working platform and its substructure. Referring now to the drawings, the scaffolding comprises a plurality of columns 8 five in the embodiment shown spaced at regular intervals along the length of the working space 9 between walls 10 and 11 of a coke oven under construction. Each column 8 is built up from a set of modular blocks denoted 12 to 15 in the upwards direction. While there are four modular blocks in each column in the drawing, it will be manifest that the number thereof will increase as construction work progresses. The modular blocks 12 to 15 are of a framed construction and are injection moulded from a high density thermoplastic polymer material and structured to give high resistance to crushing.The blocks 12 to 15 are all of the same external transverse horizontal dimensions and each is fashioned at its underside with a depending peripheral flange 16 and at its upper side with an inset peripheral ledge 17 , the modular blocks 12 to 15 of each set differing in flange and ledge widths with the ledge width of each greater than the flange width and the peripheral flange of each upper block 13 , 14 and 15 , respectively in a column 8 snugly fitting on to the peripheral ledge of the block 12 , 13 and 14 , respectively, immediately therebelow in the column. The working platform is made up of rectangular boards 20 , 21 , 22 and 23 of width the full length of the columns 8 , i.e. the transverse horizontal dimension of the latter widthwise of the working space 9 . The lengths of the boards 20 to 23 are dictated by the widths of the columns, i.e. the transverse horizontal dimension of the latter lengthwise of the working space 9 , and the spacing between the columns 8 , the end boards 20 and 23 being of length to extend from the outer face of the respective end columns 8 to midway across the respective adjacent column 8 and the intermediate boards 21 and 22 being of length to extend from midway across a respective intermediate column 8 to midway across an adjacent intermediate column 8 . Each of the boards 20 to 23 is strengthened at its underside by two rectangular section beams or bars 25 and 26 of the full length of the respective individual board, the beams or bars 25 and 26 being spaced somewhat inwardly of and extending parallel to the respective sides of the individual boards. The boards 20 to 23 are screwed or bolted to the beams or bars 25 and 26 . Base boards 27 of the same areal dimensions as the columns 8 are screwed to the undersidesof the beams or bars 25 and 26 flush with the ends of the latter and at appropriate intervals therealong to match the intervals between adjacent columns 8 , the base boards 27 to be seated on the intermediate columns 8 being halved longitudinally with the respective halves 27A and 27B Fig. 4 flush with the respective ends of the beams or bars 25 and 26 .Strips 24 of the same length as the base boards 27 are screwed to the sides of the latter to depend on edge from the bars or beams 25 and 26 and flank the upper ends of the columns when the working platform is set down thereon. It will be noted from Fig. 1 that strips 24 are not provided at the extreme ends of the platform substructure. The platform is securely locked at each of its ends to the permanent steel support structure of the coke oven in order to inhibit any tendency of the scaffolding to lean in the direction of its length. There is normally no necessity for locking the columns 8 to the floor but this could readily be effected, if required. When the working platform is to be raised to a new level, it is simply lifted from the columns 8 and the height of the latter increased by the addition thereto of further modular blocks with flanges 16 and ledges 17 of appropriate widths, whereupon the platform is again set down thereon.
