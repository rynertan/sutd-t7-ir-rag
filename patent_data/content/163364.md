# Controlled inductive coupling device.

## Abstract
An inductive coupling device 1 is provided wherein the transmission of energy through the device is controlled by the application of a steady magnetic field within the magneti cally permeable core 6 of the device, transmission being inhibited at high magnetic field intensity and restored when the magnetic field intensity is reduced to a low value. The device is especially advantageous for the safe coupling of ignition elements, such as blasting detonators, to an a.c. firing energy source.
