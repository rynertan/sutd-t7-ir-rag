# Piston position detector.

## Abstract
Piston position detector for generating an electrical signal varying linearly with piston travel of a piston ma chine. The device comprises a metal cylinder 6 rotating about an eccentric axis 7 synchronously with the crank shaft of the piston machine, the ratio of eccentricity 9 to cylinder radius being substantially equal to the ratio of crank length to connecting rod length of the piston ma chine. The cylinder surface is faced by the probe 10 of an eddy current distance meter, the arrangement being such that the desired linear relation is obtained.
