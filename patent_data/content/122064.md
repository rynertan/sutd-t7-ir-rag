# Endless belt member for a continuously variable transmission.

## Abstract
A continuously variable transmission means having block members 19 , each block member 19 having longitudinal projections 30, 31 causing the rotating radius of the block members 19 to be the same as the rotating radius of an end less carrier 60 , the block members 19 and endless carrier 60 forming a belt 10 which extends between a driving pulley 1 and a driven pulley 2 . When a portion of the belt 10 is in a transition area between a straight extension between the pul leys 1, 2 and moving toward contacting a peripheral portion on one of the pulleys 1, 2 , the sliding movement between ad jacent block members 19 and the carrier 60 is obviated due to the rotating radius of the block members 19 being equiva lent to the radius of the carrier 60 .
