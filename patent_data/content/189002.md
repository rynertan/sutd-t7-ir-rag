## Description
The invention relates to medicaments suitable for the treatment of gastrointestinal disturbances containing bicyclic heterocyclic carboxylic acid esters and amides of cyclic alcohols or amines having nitrogen as a ring atom. These compounds are referred to hereinafter as compounds of the invention. Belgian Patent Nos. 897,117 900,425 and 901,274 disclose some of such acids and amides which are stated to have serotonin M antagonistic activity also known as 5 HT₃ antagonism . The invention relates especially to the use of compounds of formula I wherein the group CO Y D is in one of the positions 3, 4 or 5 of the bicyclic ring The essential antagonistic action against 5 HT of the preferred compound ICS 205 930, indol 3 yl carboxylic acid endo 8 methyl 8 aza bicyclo 3,2,1 oct 3 yl ester on the rabbit vagus, rabbit heart and guinea pig ileum has been described P. Donatsch et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 1984, 81, 348 , and also its topical application to humans as the first 5 HT₃ antagonist. It was stated to be a competitive antagonist of the 5 HT₃ receptors in the guinea pig ileum on the basis of the effect of the compound in counteracting 5 HT induced spasms, these spasms being prolonged and permanent contractions. Moreover, no analysis was disclosed of its action in the guinea pig ileum. Several drugs e.g. metoclopramide are known for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders gut motility disorders . Action has been ascribed to opiates e.g. loperamide , dopaminergic compounds e.g. metoclopramide although for most drugs the mode of action is not well understood see J. R. Malegeleda Scand. J. Gastroenterology, 19, Suppl. European Patent Publication 13138 discloses benzoic acid amides of piperidylamines having an alkylene bridge across ring positions 2 and 6. The compounds are stated to be active inter alia in increasing the intragastic pressure in the rat, in reversing the apomorphine induced delay in gastric emptying in the rat, and inhibiting the apormorphine induced emetic effect in the rat. The compounds are indicated to be dopamine antagonists and useful in the treatment of impaired gastrointestinal motility, such as retarded gastric emptying, dyspepsia, flatulence, oesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer and emesis. The compounds of the present invention in general do not significantly affect apomorphine induced symptoms. They show on the other hand a long lasting and potent effect in the treatment of serotonin induced gastrointestinal disturbances by action on 5 HT₃ receptors. The compounds of the invention have thus a different mechanism of action to that stated for those in European Patent Publication 13138 and are well tolerated. Peristaltic movements Peristaltis are coordinated contractions and are necessary for the proper functioning of the gastrointestinal system. We have now found that activation of 5 HT₃ receptors is involved in provocation of abnormal peristaltic movements and associated gastrointestinal disorders of motility and secretion. Also we have found that serotonin antagonists are useful in decreasing increased peristaltic movements in the intestines and increasing decreased peristaltic movements in the stomach, and are hence useful in the treatment of disorders of gastric motility. We have further found that reflexes responsible for different kinds of intestinal reactions such as smooth muscle contractions, secretion by mucosal cells and or dilation of intestinal blood vessels, a pre requisite for the secreation of fluids, are stimulated by stimulation of 5 HT₃ receptors located on afferent sensory neurons by 5 HT₃ released on the serosal side and are blocked by 5 HT₃ antagonists. Preferred compounds of the invention include The action of the compounds of the invention is shown in the following tests The compounds of the invention facilitate field stimulation induced contractions in muscle strips from different parts of the guinea pig stomach and are therefore indicated to increase decreased peristaltic movements in the stomach and to enhance gastric emptying in vivo. The test is effected as follows The compounds of the invention are active at about 10 ⁷ M to about 10 ⁹ Molar and induce frequency related increases in contraction responses. Compound E produced a maximal response at 10 ⁸ M and was 100 times more active than metoclopramide. The compounds of the invention also induce gastric emptying as indicated in standard in vivo tests, e.g. in conscious guinea pigs having stomachs made atonic i.e. having decreased peristaltic movements by fasting and wherein the passage of glass spheroids was observed by X ray techniques. The experiment is effected as follows Six guinea pigs were used at each dose level of drug and responses compared to those of guinea pigs receiving the appropriate vehicle. The significance of differences between drug and control responses was assessed using the Mann Whitney U test. The compounds of the invention are active at doses of about 0.01 to about 1 mg kg i.p. in enhancing gastric emptying. Compound E was about 50 times more active than metoclopramide. The effect of the compounds increasing gastric emptying indicates an increased tonus on gastrointestinal tract. The compounds of the invention are also useful in inhibiting increased peristaltic movements in the intestines as indicated in the following tests. In a further test the inhibition of the increase in gastrointestinal motility induced by 5 hydroxytryptophan 5 HTP by the compounds of the invention was observed. Male NMRI mice 18 32 g in weight are deprived of food 20 hours before the test. Water is not limited. The animals are separated by a barrier from their straw and access to feces. At the beginning of the test the animals are separated in individual single cages and water is removed. All animals were treated with the test compound or saline. I.p. administration was used. Injection volume was 0.1 ml 10 g. 30 minutes after pre treatment 5 HTP or saline was administered. Injection volume 0.1 ml 10 g. Dose 3 mg kg. At the same time charcoal was administered perorally 10 suspension in water 0.1 ml 10g . 45 minutes after the start of the experiment the animals were killed. The intestines from the stomach to the rectum were examined. For each animal the transit distance of the front of the charcoal meal along the intestine was measured. The distance was ascertained as a percentage of the whole intestinal length. Groups of at least 3 animals were used. The compounds of the invention inhibit 5 HTP induced motility at doses of about 10 to 100 µg kg i.p. In a further test the compounds are shown to inhibit cholera toxin induced secretory diarrhea which leads to increased perstaltic motility. Male NMRI mice 20 30 g were deprived of food for 24 hours, but had free access to water. For the duration of the experiment water was subsequently withdrawn. Saline or the test compound were administered intraperitoneally. Four dose levels of each drug were investigated and each dose was given to 5 animals. One hour after pre treatment with the drug the animals were challenged with 200 µg of pure cholera toxin p.o. through a tube to each stomach followed by 2 ml of the above Tyrode solution. Three hours later the administration of the test compounds was repeated. Four hours after the cholera toxin challenge the animals were killed and the content of the whole intestine determined by weighing. The intestinal contents are usually increased under the influence of cholera toxin. This effect was reduced by 50 by the test compounds, in particular by 50 at a dose of 100 to 500 micrograms kg. An increase in the dose of compound E did not lead to a reduction in the stomach contents. The isolated longitudinal muscle of the guinea pig ileum with its adhering myenteric plexus is a well established model which permits investigation of the mechanism of action of various neurtransmitters. It does not, however, indicate by itself action of the compounds on peristaltic movements. Male guinea pigs 200 400 g were killed by a blow on the head and exsanguinated. A length of small intestine was removed about 2 cm from the ileo caecal valve. The mesentery was carefully removed and the ileum was stretched over a glass rod. By stroking tangentially away from the mesenteric attachment with a wad of cotton wool, the longitudinal muscle layer was separated and stripped from the unterlying circular muscle. Longitudinal muscle strips, 3 4 cm length, were mounted in a 10 ml organ bath containing Tyrode solution at 37 C and bubbled with 5 carbon dioxide in oxygen. The Tyrode solution was of the following composition mmol 1 NaCl, 137.0 CaCl₂, 1.8 KCl, 2.7 MgCl₂, 1.05 NaHCO₃, 11.9 NaH₂PO₄, 0.4 glucose, 5.6. The strips were placed under a resting tension of 500 mg. Contractions were recorded with an isotonic pendulum lever. After equilibration for 30 min a set concentration of carbachol was applied in 10 ml intervals until a consistant reaction was achieved. Non cumulative concentration response curves for 5 HT were established by adding increasing concentrations of the agonist to the organ bath at intervals of at least 15 min. Preceding experiments showed that the intervals were long enough to avoid tachyphylaxis. Each concentration was left in contact with the tissue for 1 min. Each strip was only used to record two concentration response curves the first for 5 HT alone and the second for 5 HT in the presence of a set concentration of antagonist, each strip thus serving as its own control. Antagonists were allowed to preequilibrate for at least 10 min prior to addition of 5 HT. The contractions expressed as percentage of the maximal response to 5 HT obtained from several preparations were plotted as mean values in order to obtain log concentration response curves. Inhibition constants were expressed in the form of pA₂ values which were graphically determined according to conventional methods Arunlakshana and Schild, 1959. Mc Kay 1978 . In this test 5 HT elicits a concentration dependent contractile effect. 5 HT induces its major contractile effects in the longitudinal muscle strip of the guinea pig ileum by releasing substance P from nerve endings within this tissue. Its effect is mediated by two different 5 HT receptors. At low concentrations 5 HT activates a neuronal receptor which causes substance P release. The liberated substance P activates neuronal substance P receptors and this causes the release of acetylcholine which subsequently activates muscarinic receptors located on smooth muscle cells and brings about contraction. At higher concentrations 5 HT activates a second neuronal receptor which results in release of sufficient quantities of substance P to cause activation of substance P receptors on smooth muscle cells and thereby cause contraction. The compounds of the invention block preferentially the low affinity 5 HT receptors thereby inhibiting 5 HT induced contraction e.g. at concentrations from about 10 ⁷ to about 10 ⁹ mol litre. In this test the ratio between the pA₂ value and the pD ₂ value is conveniently greater than 100, more preferably 1000. The compounds have little affinity for the high affinity 5 HT receptor indicated to be responsible for controlling secretion and motility processes involving acetylcholine release, but have greater affinity for the low affinity serotonin receptor sub type which is indicated to be involved in pathophysiological abnormal peristaltic movements conditions such as gastroparesis lack of stomach motility or diarrhea. The compounds of the invention preferentially inhibit the 5 HT reflex without affecting the basal reflex activity and an increase in peristaltic movements. This is in contrast to drugs like atropine which paralyse the whole reflex, and metoclopramide which has dopamine agonist action. In the charcoal meal test in the rat at doses of over 50 mg kg s.c. of the compounds of the invention the influence on normal gastric motility is not significant. The compounds of the invention have insignificant action on dopamine binding sites, e.g. having an IC₅₀ of 100 mM litre or more using tritiated haloperidol. Gastrointestinal disorders which result from increased peristaltic movements in the intestinal tract or from decreased peristaltic movements in the stomach are therefore indicated to be treated by blockade of 5 HT₃ neuronal receptors. The compounds of the invention are indicated for use in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. The compounds also inhibit or prevent the action of 5 HT on low affinity 5 HT receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, and therefore are indicated for use in the treatment of gastroparesis or disturbances of motility. They are also indicated for use in gastrointestinal disorders where an abnormal increase in the synthesis or liberation of 5 HT from the enterochromaffin cells or neurons has taken place without significantly affecting basal secretion or motility. They are also indicated to be well tolerated. The compounds of the invention are therefore useful in the treatment of gastrointestinal disturbances which require antagonism to 5 HT₃ receptors. The medicaments prepared according to the invention containing compounds of formula I are suitable for the treatment of gastro intestinal disturbances selected from gastritis, peptic ulcer, biliary dyskinesia, spastic colon, appendicitis, irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn s disease, ulcerative colitis, carcinoid syndrome and diarrhea of different genesis, e.g. secretory diarrhea, bacteria induced diarrhea, choleric diarrhea, traveller s diarrhea, psychogenic diarrhea or oesophageal motility disturbances, achalasis, hiatus hernia, cardia insufficiency, gastrooesophageal and gastroduodenal reflux, stomach hypotonia, pylorus hyperplasia, paralytic ileus and Hirschsprung s disease. For the above indications, the exact dosage of compounds of formula I will, of course, vary depending on the compound employed, mode of administration and treatment disired. In general, satisfactory results are obtained in doses from 0.01 to 10 mg kg of compounds of formula I. For the larger primates, in particular humans, an indicated daily dosage is in the range from 0.5 mg to 500 mg e.g. 20 to 200, or 20 to 100 mg or 20 to 400 mg , of a compound of formula I conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses 2 to 4 times a day. Unit dosage forms contain, for example, from 0.1 mg to 250 mg of the compound. If desired, the medicaments may be administered in a single dose for acute therapy. From compounds of formula I compounds E and F are the preferred compounds. The compounds of formula I in form of medicaments may be administered in similar manner to known standards for use in these indications. The suitable daily dosage for a particular compound will depend on a number of factors, such as its relative potency of activity. On the basis of the activity of the compound E in the above tests, an indicated daily dose for the compound E is from 5 to 20 mg p.o. for larger primates such as humans. The compounds of formula I may be present in the medicaments in free base form or in pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt form or in a quaternary ammonium salt form. Such salts may be prepared in conventional manner and are in general known. They exhibit the same order of activity as the free base form and medicaments comprise a compound of formula I in free base or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt form or quaternary ammonium salt form in association with pharmaceutical carrier or diluent. Such medicaments may be manufactured in conventional manner. The specific compounds maintained hereinafter are preferred to be present in the medicaments in the salt form mentioned in the above Belgian patents, e.g. Compound E as the hydrochloride. The compounds F and G have previously only been disclosed in the free base form. We have now found that compounds F and G are preferably used e.g. in medicaments in the form of the hydrochloride of compound F m.pt. 242 243 C and hydrogen maleate of compound G m.pt. 171 172 C . These forms have been found to have especially advantageous properties, e.g. from the solubility and stability points of view. The medicaments may be administered by any conventional route, in particular enterally, preferably orally, e.g. in the form of tablets or capsules or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers and diluents for oral administration include polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, mannitol, lactose etc. granulating agents, and disintegrating agents such as starch and algenic acid, binding agents such as stearic and gelatine, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate.
