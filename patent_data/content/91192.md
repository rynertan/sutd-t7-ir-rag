# Servo control apparatus and method of controlling the rotational velocity and phase of a rotating mechanism.

## Abstract
The scanner servo includes a velocity loop as well as a position loop, and by virtue of the fact that it is controlled by a microprocessor 30 in a unique way, has extraordinary accuracy because the resolving power of the servo is essentially that of the microprocessor itself. The interrupts to the microprocessor occur in sequence with a first interrupt causing the microprocessor to cease current activity, store all required information in a stack register and thereafter wait until a subsequent interrupt occurs which enables it to immediately act to perform control operations with respect to the scanner servo. This enables the velocity loop to perform the vast majority of the work required by the servo and as a result of this, the phase closed servo loop operates as a positioning loop in the true sense.
