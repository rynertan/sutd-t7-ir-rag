# Apparatus for fuel vapor recovery.

## Abstract
A filler neck assembly is mounted to a fueling port at one end and to a fuel tank through a tank entry nipple at the opposite end, which assembly provides a fuel path into the tank and a vapor recovery path out of the tank while being serviced from a fuel dispensing nozzle having vapor recovery means. The filler neck comprises a fuel delivery tube con nected to the fueling port and to the inside of the tank through a baffle within the tank entry nipple. The baffle securely seats the tube within the tank. The fuel delivery tube is coaxially mounted within the bore of an outer tube having ribs on the inside surface of its bore, the outer tube also being connected to the fueling port and to the tank entry nipple. In a second embodiment the ribs are on the outside surface of the inner fuel delivery tube while the bore of the outer tube is a smooth surface. In either embodiment the tubes are connected to the fueling port and to the inside of the tank entry nipple and the relationship of the two tubes and the tank baffle is such as to provide a vapor path between the tubes from the tank to the dispensing nozzle vapor recovery means via the valleys definedby ribs such that the vapor may be returned to the source supply of fuel.
