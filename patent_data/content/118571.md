## Description
INHIBITOR OF ALDOSE REDUCTASE The present invention relates to an inhibitor of aldose reductase hereinafter referred to as AR containing a flavone derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an effective ingredient. Complications of diabetes such as cataract and diseases of the retina and the kidney are caused by an unnecessary and harmful accumulation of the corresponding polyols derived from sugars by AR. For instance, sugar cataract is caused by turbidity of a lens which is caused by unnecessary and harmful accumulation of the corresponding sugar alcohols derived from glucose and galactose by AR which exists in a lens of an eyeball.Accordingly, it is essential to inhibit the enzyme activity of AR being a direct cause of the complications as strong as possible in order to effectively prevent, reduce or treat the complications. There hitherto have been provided many compounds such as alrestatin and sorbinil as effective ingredients of inhibitors of AR. The most potent example of those inhibitors was quercitrin which is one of flavone derivatives having the following formula I EMI1.1 Quercitrin, however, is not potent enough to inhibit AR activity. As a result of extensive study on dozens of flavone derivatives to find more potent inhibitors of AR by utilizing AR from rat and bovine lenses, it has now been found that 3 ,4 dihydroxy 5,6,7,8tetramethoxyflavone hereinafter referred to as LARI and the salt thereof has a particularly potent inhibitory activity against AR. In accordance with the present invention, there can be provided a pharmaceutical composition having a particularly potent inhibitory activity against AR containing, as the effective ingredient, a flavone derivative having the following formula II EMI2.1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the flavone derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Though all the dozens of flavone derivatives including the above mentioned quercitrin obtained by chemical synthesis have a flavone skeleton, there is a large difference in inhibitory activities against AR of the above flavone derivatives depending on the kind and number of the binding groups such as hydroxyl group, methoxyl group or acetoxyl group, and the binding position. The compound 11 or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is a typical example of inhibitors of AR having the most potent inhibitory activity against AR. LARI inhibits rat lens AR hereinafter referred to as RLAR with a concentration of inhibitor needed to elicit 50 inhibition hereinafter referred to as IC50 l value of 3.6 x 10 M and inhibits bovine lens AR hereinafter referred to as BLAR with an IC50 value of 1.8 x 10 M, while quercitrin inhibits RLAR and BLAR with IC50 values of 4.9 x 10 M and 3.3 x 10 M, 6pI, respectively. The inhibitory activity against AR of LARI is about 17 times as potent as that of quercitrin. A process for preparing LARI being an effective ingredient of the inhibitor of the present invention can be summarized as follows LARI can be prepared by hydrogenolysis of 3 ,4 bis benzyloxy 5,6,7,8tetramethoxyflavone prepared from 2 hydroxy 3,4,5,6 tetramethoxyacetophenone employed as a starting material. The salt of LARI with Na, K, NH4, Mg, and the like can be easily obtained in a usual manner. LARI or the salt thereof has a highly potent inhibitory activity against AR and the inhibitor of the present invention containing LARI as an effective ingredient has an excellent effect on preventing, reducing or treating the complications of diabetes. The inhibitor of the present invention can be formulated by a usual manner in a form of tablet, powder, syrup and liquid for injections or ophthalmic solution with conventional pharmaceutical carriers or media and administered both orally and parenterally. Examples of the carrier or medium are, for instance, excipients, binders, lubricants, coloring agents, perfumes, emulsifying agents, dispersing agents, and the like.If necessary, sterilized water, vegetable oil or harmless organic solvent can be used with the above carrier or medium. Though the usual dosage is 100 mg. or less kg.body weight day as a flavone derivative to adult, the preferable dosage is determined by physicians doctors according to conditions of patients. The present invention is more specifically described and explained by means of the followingExamples. It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the Examples and various changes and modifications may be made in the invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. Example 1 Preparation of 3 ,4 dihydroxy 5,6,7,8 tetramethoxyflavone LARI 1 Preparation ofw 3,4 bis benzyloxy benzoyll 2 hydroxy 3,4,5,6 tetramethoxyacetophenone To 1.55 g. of 2 hydroxy 3,4,5,6 tetramethoxyacetophenone was added 2.82 g. of3,4 bis benzyloxy benzoyl chloride and 10 ml. of pyridine and the mixture was heated at 120 0C. for 2 hours. The resulting reaction mixture was poured into a mixture of ice and hydrochloric acid and the precipitated oily material was extracted with ether. The ether phase was washed with a diluted hydrochloric acid, an aqueous sodium carbonate solution and water, and then dried.After distilling away ether, the resulting oily residue was dried in a desiccator to give a crude ester. Into 15 ml. of pyridine was dissolved the obtained ester and added 4 g. of powdered pottasium hydroxide. After the resulting mixture was heated at 60 C. for 4 hours with stirring, the reaction mixture was poured into a mixture of water and hydrochloric acid and the precipitated oily material was extracted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate phase was washed with a diluted hydrochloric acid, an aqueous sodium carbonate solution and water, and then dried. The solvent was distilled away to give 3.16 g. of oily crude w 3, 4 bis benzyloxy benzoyl 2 hydroxy 3,4,5, 6 tetramethoxyacetophenone. 2 Preparation of 3 ,4 bis benzyloxy 5,6,7,8 tetramethoxyf lavone Into 15 to 20 ml. of acetic acid was dissolved 2.90 g. of crude w 3,4 bis benzyloxy benzoyl 2 hydroxy 3,4,5,6 tetramethoxyacetophenone obtained in Example 1 and added 3 g. of anhydrous sodium acetate. The resulting mixture was refluxed for 4 hours and added water for separating the precipitate.

DEAE Sephacel and SephadexG 75 were purchased from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals.Matrex gel red A was purchased from the Amicon Co. All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. 1 Materials Rat lenses were removed from eyes of rats of the Wistar strain weighing 200 to 250 g. Bovine eyes were obtained from a local abattoir, and the lenses were removed and frozen until needed. 2 Preparation of Inhibitor solution All compounds to be subjected to examination were dissolved in propylene glycol being a useful solvent of low toxicity for some water insoluble drugs. A 10 3plI solution was prepared and diluted to the desired concentration with propylene glycol. To the reaction mixture were added aliquots of the diluted solution to yield concentrations of 10 8M to 10 M and a propylene glycol concentration of 1 . 3 Assay of AR activity AR assays were conducted according to the procedure of Hayman and Kinoshita J. Biol. Chem. 240, p. 877 1965 , except for the addition of ammonium sulfate instead of lithium sulfate to the reaction mixture. Assays were performed at 300C. in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.2 containing 0.4 M ammonium sulfate, 10 mM DL glyceraldehyde and 0.16 mM NADPH and the enzyme 0.010 to 0.016 unit in a total volume of 1.0 ml. The effects of inhibitors on the enzyme activity were determined in the reaction mixture containing 10 p1. of each inhibitor solution at the desired concentration.The blank reference to correct for non specific reduction of NADPH contained all of the above compounds except the the above DL glyceraldehyde. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the above DL glyceraldehyde, and the rate of NADPH oxidation was followed by recording the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. on a Gilford model 250 spectrophotometer. 4 Purification of lens AR BLAR and RLAR were purified according to the method of Inagaki et al Archs. Biochem. Biophys. 216, p. 337 1982 . Briefly, a 40 to 75 ammonium sulfate fraction was subjected to chromatography onDEAE Sephacel, followed by two column chromatographic steps, i.e. affinity chromatography using Matrix gel redA and gel filtration on Sephadex G 75. In the procedure, a key step was affinity chromatography on Ma trex gel redA. BLAR adsorbed on the gel was eluted with 0.33 mM NADPH, elution of RLAR adsorbed on the gel was effected by means of a linear gradient of NaCl O to 1.0 M . BLAR and RLAR were purified over 12,000 fold 4.8 units mg.protein and 380 fold 4.7 units mg. protein , respectively, and used for determining IC50 values. 5 Determination of IC50 The concentration of inhibitor needed to elicit a 50 inhibition IC50 was determined according to the method of Kador et al Docum.
