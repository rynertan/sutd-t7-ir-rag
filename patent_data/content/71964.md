# Enhanced gas separation by selective adsorption.

## Abstract
Gas separation is facilitated by imposing cyclic gas flow and pressure variations on a gas mixture in an absorption columm from the opposite ends thereof. By employing specified relative volume displacements and phase angles for such cyclic variations, the productivity of desired product is enhanced.
