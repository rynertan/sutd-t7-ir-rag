# A semidonductor device having an interconnection structure.

## Abstract
Two polycrystalline silicon tracks 7, 8 located at a relative distance of the order of submicrons which contact the subjacent semiconductor body 1 with a pn junction formed therein, are connected to each other via a metal silicide track 21 . The resulting shortcircuiting of the pn junction does not influence the operation of the circuit, for example, a memory cell, realized in the semiconductor body. By providing beforehand the whole conductor pattern with an oxide layer 10 in which a contact hole 39 is formed at the area of the shortcircuit 21 , the latter can be provided in a self aligning manner.
