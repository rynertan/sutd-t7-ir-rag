Compounds of the formula IV are described in our copending U.K. Application Number 8103350. Suitable protected derivatives of the group R are those conventional in the art, for example groups cleavable by hydrolysis such as formate or groups cleavable by hydrogenation such as benzyloxycarbonyloxy and p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyloxy. This reaction may be performed in any solvent that is substantially inert during the reaction, for example tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, dioxan, hexamethyl phosphoramide, dimethoxyethane or dimethoxydiethyl ether.Of these solvents dimethylformamide is preferred.Alternatively we have found it useful to use a phase transfer catalysts such as tetra n butyl ammonium bromide, cetyl benzyl dimethylammonium chloride and cetyltriethylammonium chloride suitable solvents include halogenated water immiscible solvents such as chloroform in the presence of water. The reaction is normally performed at ambient or depressed temperature, for example 20 C to 70 C, and preferably between 0 C and 50 C.

Of these triethylanine is preferred. Preferably the base is present in an aiiount of at least 0.9 equivalents, more preferably between 1.0 and 1.2 equivalents per niole of the thiol compound. Instead of using a base in the reaction a reactive derivative of the thiol may be used, preferably the reactive derivative is a salt of the thiol, in particular an alkali metal salt such as sodium or potassium.

The carboxyl group may be regenerated from any of the above sters by usual methods appropriate to the particular Ra group, for example, acid and base catalysed hydrolysis, or by enzymically catalysed hydrolysis, or by hydrogenation. The hydrolysis must of course be carried out under conditions to which the groups on the rest of the molecule are stable. When it is desired to produce a compound of formula II in the form of a free acid or salt by the process of this invention, a compound of formula IV is generally employed wherein Ra is a carboxyl blocking group.
