# MULITIPLE STAGE DEVICE FOR CONDENSATE REMOVAL FROM A STEAM PIPING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A condensate drainage device for a steam system which includes a series connected arrangement of orifice type devices particularly suitable for relatively small condensate drainage capacity. The orifice type devices are selected for installation in housings or bodies having advantageously placed heat exchanger fins which cooperate with the size of orifice devices installed for desired condensate drainage over a range of different steam system pressure and volumetric capacities requirements.
