# Biochemical conversion processes.

## Abstract
A method for enhancing and improving the rate and amount of bioconvension of a first chemical contained in an aqueous medium by a microbial population suitable therefor, characterised by treating an aqueous mixture of the microbial population at appropriate conditions and time period with an effective amount for the purpose of a second chemical which is structurally or biochemically analogous to the first chemical, and which second chemical, because of its analogous structure to the first chemical, permits the microbial population to adapt to the chemical to thereby affect the population in such a manner that its bioconversion capacity for the first chemical is increased without a substantial attendant increase in population.
