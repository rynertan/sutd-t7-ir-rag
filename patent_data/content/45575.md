# Process for extruding liquid crystal polymer.

## Abstract
The present invention provides an improved process for extruding liquid crystal polymer. The process comprises the steps of providing a fluid stream of liquid crystal polymer wherein the stream has a flow pattern comprising substan tial shear flow converting the flow of the fluid stream of liquid crystal polymer to a substantially elongational flow in the substantial absence of shear flow and extruding the fluid stream of liquid crystal polymer to form a shaped article having the polymer molecules oriented substantially parallel to the flow direction. The resulting articles are self reinforcing, having mechanical properties superior to con ventional extruded liquid crystal polymer articles and com parable to those of articles formed from fiber reinforced isotropic polymeric materials. In a preferred embodiment, the flow of the fluid stream of liquid crystal polymer is converted to a substantially elongational flow by passing the fluid stream of liquid crystal polymer through at least one grid 9 having a plurality of converging passages e.g., cone shaped or trumpet shaped holes .
