# BRAKE PAD FOR DISK BRAKES

## Abstract
A brake pad for friction brakes of the disk brake type is provided with a brake lining 7 mounted on a support means 8 , such as to be pressable against a brake disk 2 . The support means carries a centrally placed pressure distri butor 5 for translating pressing force to the brake pad 3 . The support means includes a first 9 and a second 10 part between which a liquid filled balancing chamber 11 is ar ranged. Force translation between the first and second parts is intended to take place substantially via the liquid in the balancing chamber 11 , so that good surface engagement is enabled between the brake disk 2 and lining 7 , also for large pressing force and when the brake pad has large exten sion.
