# A stacker for folded sheets.

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for continuous collecting, compres sing and stacking folded multiple sheet signatures from a press fly end, wherein horizontally conveyed, overlapped signatures are streamtransferred from in feed to vertical stacking position, the apparatus being characterized by a crusher station and a floating compressor station the latter of which has opposed tensioned conveyor belts which are retained in a face to face uniformly flat, negative angular relationship by multiple seriesmounted rollers. The rollers are in compression contact with uppermost floating conveyor belts whereby compression is obtained through the signatures indirectly to tensioned lower conveyor belts, the signatures being thus continuously moved in a stream from a precise, endwise overlapping relationship, to a vertical endwise stacked relationship within a stacking receiver. To enhance the transfer function, a signature kicking apparatus engages each signatue as it emanates from the floating conveyors, thereby forcing the signatures vertically upward against a stripper bar in the receiver.
