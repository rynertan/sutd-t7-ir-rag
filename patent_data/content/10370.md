# Forming permanent bends in convoluted reinforced flexible tubing.

## Abstract
A method of forming a permanent curve in a length of convoluted wire reinforced flexible plastics tubing 1 com prises the steps of first flexing the chosen region of the tube 1 into a curve whose radius is tighter than that eventually desired, forcibly holding said region in said tighter than desired curve, applying to the tube an internal pressure which is insufficient to burst the tube but which is high enough to strain the wire reinforcement 2 , the tube material, 1 or both, in the bend region beyond its or their elastic limit maintaining said internal pressure for a finite period of time releasing the pressure and finally releasing the tube 1 from its preheld curve.
