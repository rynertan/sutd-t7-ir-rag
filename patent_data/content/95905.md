# A vehicle stabilising system.

## Abstract
A stabilising system for a vehicle carrying a load support ing platform 10 , to prevent the platform from tilting when the load is unevenly distributed about the longitudinal centre line of the vehicle, the system comprising a pair of jacks 17 which are pivotally attached to the platform 10 at the sides thereof outside the adjacent wheels 15 . The jacks carry inwardly extending foot plates 18 . The jacks are lowered behind the vehicle wheels which are then driven in reverse so that the tyres ride up onto the foot plates 18 . In this position the jacks extend vertically to the ground and support their associated wheels thus limiting the tilting of the platform 10 . Means are provided to withdraw the jacks to their inoperative positions for travelling. The stabilising system is self engaging by revers ing the vehicle after releasing the jacks.
