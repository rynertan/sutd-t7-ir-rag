## Description
The present invention relates to hydrocracking catalysts comprising non zeolitic molecular sieves and to processes employing such hydrocracking catalysts. The literature on such catalysts and processes is quite extensive. Certain technical areas have been addressed as of particular interest as is readily apparent based on the large numbers of patents on certain technical topics, e.g., the use of certain zeolites in hydrocracking catalysts. Representatives of the patents in this area are those relating to the use of ZSM type zeolites in hydrocracking and include U.S. Patent No. 3,894,934 ZSM 5 U.S. Patent No. 3,871,993 ZSM 5, ZSM 11, ZSM 12 and ZSM 21 U.S. Patent No. 3,702,886 ZSM 5 and U.S. Patent No. 3,758,403 ZSM 5 in combination with zeolite Y of and U.S. Patent No. 3,972,983 ZSM 20 . Although the aforementioned patents on the use of ZSM type zeolites in hydrocracking catalysts are of interest, the use of these zeolites has not been of significant commercial interest to date. The commercially significant activity in the hydrocracking area has been for the most part directed to further elaboration on the basic hydrocracking technology which has arisen in relation to zeolite Y, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,130,007. The development of hydrocracking catalysts based on a Y type zeolite has taken many directions. Illustrative of the various processes which have arisen are those disclosed in the following patents Although there has been extensive development of Y type hydrocracking catalysts there has been little development of truly new hydrocracking catalysts based on the development of new molecular sieve components. This paradox, the lack of new catalytic materials despite the sizable economic interest, is readily understood by an appreciation of the fact that the work horse of the commercial hydrocracking business is zeolite Y. As a result, the patent literature discloses the clear preference towards improving zeolite Y. The existence of zeolite Y and its use as a catalyst for hydrocracking processes is now well accepted if not, in fact, legendary. Still, the state of the art relating to zeolite Y and its use in hydrocracking catalysts has been generally limited to ion exchange techniques, aluminum extraction techniques, catalyst formulation techniques and to secondary treatment processes which tend to remove aluminum from zeolite Y. The instant invention is distinguished from the hydrocracking catalysts and processes of the prior art by employing selected non zeolitic molecular sieves which may be employed alone or in conjunction with the catalysts traditionally employed in hydrocracking processes. These non zeolitic molecular sieves are unique in their ability to provide products with product distributions different from those obtained by use of catalysts derived from zeolitic aluminosilicates.

FIG. 13 is a plot of the C₃ yield as a function of conversion for Catalyst A and Catalyst B. The present invention relates to hydrocracking catalysts and to hydrocracking employing such catalysts. The catalysts comprise at least one non zeolitic molecular sieve, as hereinafter described, at least one hydrogenation catalyst noble or base metal component and, optionally, particles of a traditional hydrocracking catalyst as heretofore employed and having catalytic activity for hydrocracking hydrocarbon feedstocks at effective hydrocracking conditions, e.g. particles of a traditional hydrocracking catalyst containing a zeolitic aluminosilicate s of the type generally employed in such hydrocracking catalysts. The non zeolitic molecular sieves employed in the instant invention are characterized in their calcined form by an adsorption of oxygen of at least 4 percent by weight at a partial pressure of 0.133 bar 100 torr and a temperature of 186 C and an adsorption of isobutane of at least 2 percent by weight at a partial pressure of 0.665 bar and a temperature of 20 C. The traditional catalyst component, e.g., a zeolitic aluminosilicate, if any, is characterized as being a hydrocracking catalyst component, such as heretofore traditionally employed in hydrocracking processes, e.g., the various forms of zeolite Y, silica alumina, and hydrogenation components. The non zeolitic molecular sieves employed in this invention are unique in that such are not zeolitic aluminosilicates See The present invention relates to hydrocracking wherein high boiling hydrocarbon feedstocks are converted to lower boiling products by cracking the high boiling hydrocarbon feedstock components and hydrogenating unsaturates in the present product. Hydrocracking processes and the effective conditions for carrying them out are well known in the art see It has been found that the use of specific non zeolitic molecular sieves provide different product distributions when such non zeolitic molecular sieves associated with a hydrogenation component are employed and, optionally, when employed in conjunction with conventional hydrocracking catalysts having activity at effective hydrocracking conditions. Heretofore, the zeolite containing hydrocracking catalysts of the prior art have required that certain penalties be endured for the optimization of particular process variables or product characteristics, e.g., octane. For example, an improvement in gasoline octane of the products, as indicated by an increased ratio of isoparaffins to normal paraffins, has been observed to occur with a concurrent decrease in gasoline yield and in feed conversion when zeolitic aluminosilicate based catalysts are employed. The isoparaffin to normal paraffin ratio in the gasoline product has long been employed as an indication of higher octane products and its increase or decrease used as an indication of the octane of the gasoline product. The increase in the isoparaffin in the light gasoline product boiling below 85.1 C 185 F relative to the normal paraffins occurs without increasing or significantly increasing the loss in gasoline yield and feed stock conversion and is of significant commercial importance. This increase in the isoparaffin to normal paraffin ratio in the light gasoline fraction is particularly significant, since this fraction is not generally subjected to further processing to improve its octane number. The non zeolitic molecular sieves employed in the instant invention are selected from the hereinafter described group of non zeolitic molecular sieves as being characterized in their calcined form by an adsorption of oxygen of at least 4 percent by weight at a partial pressure of 0.133 bar 100 torr and a temperature of 186 C and are characterized in their calcined form by an adsorption of isobutane of at least 2 percent by weight at a partial pressure of 0.665 bar 500 torr and a temperature of 20 C. The non zeolitic molecular sieves employed in the instant invention are preferably characterized by the aforementioned adsorption criteria and also characterized by an adsorption of triethylamine from zero to less than 5 percent by weight, preferably less than 3 percent by weight, at a partial pressure of 3.46 mbar 2.6 torr and a temperature of 22 C.

The NZ MSs employed herein are characterized by the aforementioned adsorption criteria. Certain NZ MS species which may be employed herein are designated in one or more of the aforementioned subclasses of the class of NZ MS by a n designation of 11, 14, 17, 18, 25, 31, 33, 34, 35, 39, 40, 44 and 47.

The above characterization of the NZ MSs employed in the instant invention relates to an adsorption characterization that is carried out on a NZ MS which has been subjected to a post synthesis treatment, e.g., calcination or chemical treatment, to remove a substantial portion of the template R which is present as a result of synthesis. Although a particular NZ MS is characterized herein by reference to its adsorption of isobutane or triethylamine as being to the adsorption characteristics of the NZ MS in its calcined form, the instant invention necessarily includes the use of a non calcined or modified NZ MSs which are characterized by such adsorption in the modified or calcined form, since upon use of such a non calcined NZ MS in the instant process at effective hydrocracking conditions the NZ MS may be calcined or hydrothermally treated As discussed, above it has been found that this class of NZ MS provides product distributions not observed by use of traditional hydrocracking catalysts containing zeolitic aluminosilicate components. Heretofore, the catalysts of the prior art containing zeolite have generally exhibited a decrease in gasoline yield and or conversion for the optimization of a particular process variable or product characteristic e.g., octane of the gasoline product. Such penalties are reduced or eliminated by use of the instant catalysts. An increase in the isoparaffin to normal paraffins ratio is desirable in gasoline products and an increase is an indication of higher octane products. In addition to the above improvement in the octane of the gasoline products, the improvement in octane permits the use of base metal catalysts in processes where noble metal catalysts were heretofore required to obtain high octane products. Since base metal catalysts are generally more resistant to feed contaminants, sulfur containing organic compounds, the instant invention provides more resistant catalysts without the octane penalty heretofore associated with base metal catalysts. When noble metal catalysts are employed with the instant NZ MS s the instant invention further provides an improvement in the isoparaffin content of the gasoline products. The NZ MSs of the instant invention may be employed in conjunction with traditional hydrocracking catalysts and accordingly, optionally, a zeolitic aluminosilicate component may be employed in conjunction with the NZ MS containing catalysts. The zeolitic aluminosilicate component of such catalysts may be any aluminosilicate heretofore employed as a component in hydrocracking catalysts.

Another zeolitic aluminosilicate employable herein is LZ 210 , described in E.P.C. Publication No. 82,211 published June 29, 1983. In one embodiment the silica to alumino mole ratio is between about 7 and about 11 and preferably between about 8 and about 10. Hydrocracking catalysts containing LZ 210 are disclosed in EP A 124,120 and such may be employed herein as the optional traditional hydrocracking component. The term ZSM type zeolites is generally employed in the art to refer to those zeolites denominated by the nomenclature ZSM n where n is an integer. The ZSM type aluminosilicates include but are not limited to ZSM 5, ZSM 11, ZSM 12, ZSM 23, ZSM 35, ZSM 38, ZSM 48 and other similar materials. ZSM 5 is described in greater detail in U.S. Patent No. 3,702,886 and US E 29,948. ZSM 11 is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,709,979. ZSM 12 is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,832,449. ZSM 23 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,076,842. ZSM 35 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,016,245. ZSM 38 is more particularly describing U.S. Patent No. 4,046,859. ZSM 48 is more particularly described in U.S. Patent No. 4,423,021. In addition, crystalline silicates such as silicalite U.S.Patent No. 4,061,724 may be employed with the NZ MSs of the instant invention. The catalysts of the instant invention comprise at least one NZ MS, as above characterized, and, optionally, may also contain one or more traditional hydrocracking catalysts, including zeolitic aluminosilicate components and hydrogenation cracking components such as nickel, and tungsten sulfide and the like. The relative amount of the NZ MS component or traditional hydrocracking catalyst component, if any, will depend at least in part, on the selected crude oil feedstock and on the desired product distribution to be obtained therefrom, but in all instances an effective amount of at least one NZ MS is employed. When a zeolitic aluminosilicate is employed as a part of the traditional hydrocracking component the relative weight ratio of the zeolitic aluminosilicate to the NZ MS is generally between 1 10 and 500 1, desirably between 1 10 and 200 1, preferably between 1 2 and 50 1, and most preferably is between 1 1 and 20 1. The zeolitic aluminosilicate and NZ MS may be ion exchanged with a selected cation s and or thermally treated either before or after mixture with each other or after such have been added separately or concurrently to one or more inorganic oxide matrix components. When the NZ MS molecular sieves are ion exchanged such are preferably exchanged with a hydrogen forming cation species, e.g., NH 4, H , quaternary ammonium cations, etc. The NZ MS preferably has at least part of its cations as hydrogen forming cation species. Any ion exchange, impregnation and or occlusion of the NZ MS and or zeolitic aluminosilicate s , if any, may be carried out by contacting such with a solution of at least one cation, including those selected from the group of cations consisting of ammonium, Group IIA, Group IIIA, Group IIIB to VIIB and rare earth cations selected from the group consisting of cerium, lanthenum, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, godolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium and mixtures thereof. The exact nature of the relationship of rare earth cations and the NZ MSs and their effect on the activity and or selectivity of the NZ MS containing catalyst is not clearly understood at present. The cation s , e.g., rare earth cation, may replace at least a portion of the cations initially present in the zeolitic aluminosilicate and or NZ MS or may be present as impregnated or occluded species. Such cations may be present in an effective amount which may be between 0.1 weight percent and 20 weight percent, typically between 0.5 and 10 weight percent, based on the weight of the starting zeolitic aluminosilicate and or NZ MS. The hydrocracking catalysts of this invention contain an effective amount of at least one hydrogenation component of the type commonly employed in hydrocracking catalysts. The hydrogenation catalyst component is generally selected from the group of hydrogenation catalysts consisting of one or more metals of Group VI B and Group VIII, including the salts, complexes and solutions containing such metals. The hydrogenation catalyst is preferably selected from the group of metals, salts and complexes of the group consisting of at least one of platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium and mixtures thereof or the group consisting of at least one of nickel, molybdenum, cobalt, tungsten, titanium, chromium and mixtures thereof. As recognized in the art, the noble and base metals will not generally be employed in the same catalyst system although such are not excluded from the scope of this invention. Reference to the catalytically active metal or metals is intended to encompass such metal or metals in the elemental state or in some form such as an oxide, sulfide, halide, carboxylate and the like. The hydrogenetion component is present in an effective amount to provide the hydrogenation function of the hydrocracking catalyst. When the hydrogenation catalyst is a noble metal it is generally present in an amount between 0.05 and 1.5 by weight based on the total weight of the hydrocracking catalyst, including the weight of any binder or matrix material which may be present, as hereinafter discussed, although effective amounts outside this range may be employed. Although effective amounts in excess of 1.5 percent by weight may be employed, the preferred effective amount of the noble metal hydrogenation catalyst is between 0.3 and 1.2 by weight. When the hydrogenation catalyst is a base metal s the effective amount will generally be between 1.0 and 30 percent by weight or more of the base metal, expressed as the oxide s , based on the total weight of the hydrocracking catalyst, although effective amounts outside this range may be employed. The final form of the hydrogenation component of the hydrocracking catalyst is not narrowly limited herein but may be a metal oxide, metal sulfide or other catalytically active form. Since sulfur is typically present in the hydrocarbon feedstock being treated, the actual form of some of the hydrogenation component s may well in some cases be at least in part a sulfide due to The hydrogenation components can be incorporated into the overall catalyst composition by any one of numerous procedures. They can be added either to the NZ MS component, zeolitic aluminosilicate component, if any, or to any metal oxide or to a combination thereof by ion exchange, impregnation, occlusion and the like. In the alternative, multiple hydrogenation components two or more may be added as powders in formulation of the catalyst. They may be added by co mulling, impregnation, or ion exchange whereby one or more may be added to NZ MS and or zeolitic aluminosilicate. For example, noble or base metal compounds, such as the sulfides, oxides or water soluble salts, can be added by co mulling, impregnation or precipitation before the composite is finally calcined. In the alternative these components can be added to the finished particle by impregnation with an aqueous, alcoholic, hydrocarbon, or other nonaqueous solution or soluble compounds or precursors. Impregnation or co mulling are generally the preferred techniques when the hydrogenation component is a base metal while ion exchange techniques are generally preferred when noble metals are employed as the hydrogenation catalyst. Although the hydrogenation components can be combined with the NZ MS and or zeolitic aluminosilicate, if any, as the oxides, that is generally not the case. They are usually added as a metal salt which can be thermally converted to the corresponding oxide in an oxidizing atmosphere or reduced to the metal with hydrogen or other reducing agent. The composition can be sulfided by reaction with a sulfur donor such as carbon disulfide, hydrogen sulfide, hydrocarbon thiols, elemental sulfur, and the like, described above. The above oxidizing or sulfiding processes are generally carried out on catalyst compositions which have been partially dried as desired , tableted, pelleted, extruded with binder or matrix , or formed by other means and then calcined, e.g., at a temperature above 315.5 C 600 F , usually above 426.7 C 800 F . It is well known in the art that hydrocracking catalysts, are generally employed with a binder material or, as commonly referred to, with an inorganic oxide matrix which can be inert or also catalytically active. For example inorganic matrixes such as silica, alumina silica alumina, silica zirconia, silica magnesia, alumina boria, alumina titania and the like and mixtures thereof may be employed. An inorganic oxide need not always be employed such as in the case of a preform containing the NZ MS or may be employed in an amount between 1 and 95 by weight, preferably between 10 and 80 by weight, based on the total weight of the hydrocracking composition. The term crude oil feedstock is used herein to denominate any crude oil feedstock or portion thereof and includes full range crude oils from primary, secondary or tertiary recovery from conventional or offshore oil fields and to the myriad of feedstocks derived therefrom. Crude oil feedstocks may also be syncrudes such as those that can be derived from coal, shale oil, tar sands and bitumens. The crude oil feedstock may be virgin straight run or generated synthetically by blending. Such crude oil feedstocks are traditionally desalted prior to use since sodium chloride is known to be a poison in many hydrocracking operations. Further, the term crude oil feedstocks is intended to include component parts of crude oils which have heretofore been generally employed as feedstocks or potential feeds and includes feeds such as distillate gas oils, heavy vacuum gas oils, VGO, atmospheric and vacuum resids, syncrudes, pulverized coal and fractions boiling above the traditional end of the gasoline boiling range which generally includes compounds containing greater than about eleven carbon atoms and combinations thereof. The feedstocks employed in hydrocracking generally have boiling points between 204.4 C 400 F and 482.2 C 900 F . In hydrocracking processes the hydrocarbon feedstock to be charged to the hydrocracking unit typically boils above 148.9 C 300 F , preferably between 204.4 C 400 F and 648.8 C 1200 F and more preferably between 204.4 C 400 F and 482.2 C 900 F. The hydrocarbon feed may be derived from many sources, as above discussed, including catalytic cracking processes coking processes fractionators from crude oil hydrocracking pyrolysis processes just to name a few. When operating a hydrocracking process to maximize gasoline production, the typical feedstock currently in commercial use has an end boiling point not greater than 426.7 C 800 F . Typically, a light catalytic cycle oil, or a light virgin gas oil, or mixtures thereof, boiling in the range of from 148.9 C 300 F to 426.7 C 800 F employed as a feedstock. The feed may be pre treated in a hydrotreater to effect hydrodenitrification and or hydrodesulfurization. The feed may have a significant sulfur content, present as hydrogen sulfide, ranging from 0.1 to 3 weight percent, and the nitrogen content, present as ammonia, may be present in an amount up to 4000 parts per million or more. Temperature, space velocity, and other process variables may be adjusted to compensate for the effects of nitrogen on the hydrocracking catalyst activity. The feedstock is contacted in the hydrocracking reaction zone with the hydrocracking catalyst in the presence of hydrogen containing gas and or a hydrogen generating compound. Hydrogen is consumed in the hydrocracking process and an excess of hydrogen is typically maintained in the reaction zone. Advantageously, a hydrogen to oil feed ratio or at least 28,317 m³ 1,000 standard cubic feet of hydrogen per 158,75 ℓ barrel of feed SCFB is employed, and the hydrogen to oil ratio may range up to 20,000 SCFB, preferably, 4,000 to 12,000 SCFB is employed. The hydrocracking reaction zone is typically operated under conditions of elevated temperature and pressure. The total hydrocracking pressure is usually between 28.57 bar 400 psig and 276.6 bar 4,000 pounds per square inch gauge psig and, preferably, between 35.46 bar 500 psig and 138.81 bar 2000 psig . The hydrocracking reaction is exothermic and a temperature rise occurs across the catalyst bed. Therefore, the inlet temperature to the hydrocracking reaction zone may be 12.2 C to 4.4 C 10 to 40 F lower than the exit temperature. The average hydrocracking catalyst bed temperature is between 232.2 C 450 F and 426.7 C 800 F depending on the presence or absence of NH₃ and the catalyst s age. The liquid hourly space velocity LHSV typically is between 0.2 and 5 volume of feed per hour per volume of catalyst, and preferably between 0.25 and 4 LHSV. The following examples were carried out to demonstrate the use of the hydrocracking catalysts and hydrocracking processes of the instant invention and are not intended to be limiting thereof Hydrocracking catalysts were prepared as described in the following examples and tested for their utility as hydrocracking catalysts. The catalysts were employed as hydrocracking catalysts in a first stage hydrocracking process. A selected catalyst was evaluated for hydrocracking by contacting the hydrocarbon feed gas oil feed boiling between 166.7 C 332 F and 456,1 C 853 F ASTM test method D 2887 and containing 5000 ppm sulfur and 2000 ppm nitrogen with the selected catalyst. The feedstock has a density of 0.8341g cc at 15,6 C 60 F . The sulfur and nitrogen are present by adding 0.5 weight percent sulfur in the form of thiophene and 0.2 weight percent nitrogen in the form of t butylamine to the feedstock, wherein the weight percents were based on the total weight of the feedstock. The hydrocracking process was carried out at a pressure of 100.92 bar 1450 psig and an temperature between 362.8 C 685 F and 376.1 C 709 F and at a LHSV liquid hourly space velocity of 1.7. Hydrogen was introduced at a rate of 8 x 28.317 m³ 8000 Standard Cubic Feet of hydrogen per 158.75 ℓ barrel of feedstock. The hydrocracking experiments were carried out by introducing a selected feedstock to a stainless steel reactor having an axial thermowell. The temperature in the reactor was monitored by thermocouple in the thermowell. The catalyst was in the form of extrudates and was placed in the reactor and mixed with quartz chips to minimize reactor hot spots. The hydrocarbon feedstock employed in the following examples was a gas oil having an IBP Initial Boiling Point of 166,7 C 332 F , a FBP Final Boiling Point of 456,1 C 853 F and an API Gravity of 37.9. The feedstock contained less than 0.1 weight percent total nitrogen. Chemical analysis of the feedstock gave A reference catalyst Catalyst A and two catalysts according to this invention Catalyst B and Catalyst C were prepared as follows. All weights are on an anhydrous basis unless otherwise designated. Catalyst A was prepared using a zeolitic aluminoslilicate denominated LZ 210. The LZ 210 was prepared according to the disclosure of E.P.C. Publication No. 82,211 and had a SiO₂ to Al₂O₃ ratio of 9.0, was steamed at 600 C in 100 steam for 1 hour and was ammonium exchanged by refluxing for 1 hour 1 pound of LZ 210 per pound of NH₄N0₃ provided as a 10 percent by weight aqueous solution . Catalyst A was formed into a catalyst by mixing 140 grams of LZ 210 and 60 grams of a pseudoboehmite alumina peptized with 4.2 milliliters of concentrated nitric acid in 60 ml. of water and then mulling the mixture for 10 minutes. The mixture was formed into 1 16 inch extrudates, dried at 100 C for about 10 hours and calcined at 500 C in air for 2 hours. The calcination at 500 C was carried out in a stepwise manner by heating the catalyst to 220 C over a one hour period, heating the catalyst at 220 C for 1.5 hours, heating the catalyst from 220 C to 500 C over a one hour period and then heating the catalyst at 500 C for 2 hours. The calcined extrudates were pore filled with a Ni NO₃ ₂ 6H₂0 and ammonium metatungstate solution by mixing and then drying the resulting mixture. The final Catalyst A was prepared to contain the following weight percent wt. of oxides 5 NiO, 20 WO₃, 52.5 LZ 210 and 22.5 alumina. Chemical analysis of Catalyst A for Ni0 and W0₃ gave 4.7 wt. NiO and 20.8 wt. W0₃. Catalyst B was prepared by employing SAPO 11 and LZ 210 in the formulation of a hydrocracking catalyst. SAPO 11 was prepared according to example 17 of U.S. Patent No. 4,440,871 except that the digestion time was 24 hours and was employed in the as synthesized form. The LZ 210 zeolite was the same steamed and ammonium exchanged LZ 210 employed in Catalyst A. Catalyst B was prepared by mulling 15.0 grams of SAPO 11 and 105 grams of the LZ 210 zeolitic aluminosilicate employed in Catalyst A. A solution containing 42.4 grams of ammonium metatungstate and 33.93 grams of Ni NO₃ ₂ 6H₂0 in 100 cubic centimeters cc of water was added to the mixture of SAPO 11 and LZ 210. Pseudobeohmite alumina 30.0 grams peptized by mixing with 4.2 milliliter of concentrated nitric acid in 60 milliliters in water was added to the above mixture and the resulting mixture extruded to give 1 16 inch extrudates. The extrudates were dried and calcined at 500 C as described for Catalyst A. Catalyst B was prepared to contain the following weight percent oxides of 5.0 Ni0, 20 W0₃, 52.5 LZ 210, 7.5 SAPO 11 and 15 Al₂0₃. Chemical analysis of Catalyst B for Ni0 and W0₃ gave 4 wt. Ni0 and 16 wt. W0₃. Catalyst C was prepared by employing SAPO 34 and LZ 210 to formulate the catalyst. SAPO 34 was prepared according to the procedure described in examples 32 to 38 of U.S. Patent No. 4,440,871. The LZ 210 was the same LZ 210 employed in the preparation of Catalyst A. Catalyst C was prepared by mixing 25.08 grams of SAPO 34 and 175 grams of LZ 210. The mixture was mulled for fifteen minutes and 53.8 grams of the same peptized alumina employed in Catalyst B added. The resulting mixture was then mixed for fifteen minutes. Water was then added to this mixture to form an extrudable mixture and 1 16 inch extrudates formed. The calcined extrudates were pore filled by mixing a solution containing 19.39 grams of Ni N0₃ ₂ 6H₂0 and 24.2 grams of ammonium tungstate in 53 cc of water. The extrudates were then dried and calcined at 500 C as described above for Catalyst A. Catalyst C was prepared to contain the following weight percent of oxides 5 Ni0 20 W0₃, 52.5 LZ 210, 7.5 SAPO 34 and 15 alumina. Chemical analysis of Catalyst C for Ni0 and W0₃ gave 4.99 wt. Ni0 and 20.32 wt. W0₃. The catalysts prepared in examples 1 to 3 Catalysts A, B and C were evaluated as hydrocracking catalysts according to the above described procedure over a series of conversions as set forth below n Tables A, B and C. The products were analyzed and the light gasoline MON Motor Octane Number and RON Research Octane Number calculated using a volume average of C₅ and C₆ products using the octane values in ASTM report Knocking Characterization of Pure Hydrocarbons , Technical Publication No. 225, 1958 . The MON and RON were calculated using the compounds measured in the light gasoline fraction and include the following components 2 methylbutane n pentane 2,3 dimethylbutane 2 methylpentane 3 methylpentane n hexane methylcyclopentane 2,4 dimethylbutane cyclohexane and benzene. The Conversion is the weight percent of the feedstock converted to products boiling below 215.5 C 420 F . The following products as weight percent based on feedstock are reported in Tables A, B and C C₃ products containing three carbon atoms C₁ to C₄ the products containing one to four carbon atoms C₅ to 85.1 C 185 F products containing at least 5 carbon atoms and boiling below 85.1 C 185 F C185 420 products boiling from 85.1 C 185 F to 215.5 C 420 F and C₅ to 215.5 C 420 F products containing at least 5 carbon atoms and boiling under 215.5 C 420 F . The C₅, C₆, C₇, C₈ and C₉ products are reported below. The following products were measured in each case C₅ n pentane and 2 methylbutane C₆ n hexane, 2,3 dimethylbutane, 2 methylpentane and 3 methylpentane C₇ n heptane, 2 methylhexane, 3 methylhexane and 2,4 dimethylpentane C₈ n octane, 2,2,3 trimethylpentane, 2,4 dimethylhexane 2,3 dimethylhexane, 2 methylheptane, 3,4 dimethylhexane and 3 methylheptane C₉ n nonane, 2,4 dimethylheptane, 2,6 dimethylheptane, 2,5 dimethylheptane, 4 methyloctane, 2 methyloctane and 3 methyloctane. The products are reported on a weight basis. The products are determined by the simulated distillation described in ASTM test method 2887. Comparison of the product distribution obtained using Catalyst A and those obtained using Catalysts B and C demonstrate the improved octane number of the light gasoline fraction C₅ to 85.1 C 185 F obtained using the catalyst of this invention when compared at similar conversion. Further, the C₅ and C₆ hydrocarbon iso normal ratio increased for Catalysts B and C. Since iso alkanes have higher octane numbers, the product obtained by use of Catalysts B and C have improved calculated octane numbers. The data in Tables A, B and C are graphically depicted in FIGS. 1 to 13 and demonstrate the benefits obtained by use of the catalysts of the instant invention in hydrocracking processes. FIGS. 1 and 2 show a comparison between Catalysts A, B and C of the light gasoline yield C₅ 85.1 C C₅ 185 F as a function of conversion. Catalysts B and C produced similar or higher yields of the light gasoline product as compared to that obtained by use of reference Catalyst A. FIGS. 3 and 4 compares the calculated RON Research Octane Number of the light gasoline fractions obtained by use of Catalyst A, B and C. Catalysts B and C produced light gasoline fractions having higher RON values as compared to the light gasoline fractions produced by use of Catalyst A. FIG. 5 compares the yield of the heavy gasoline fraction C₅ to 215.5 C C₅ to 420 F as a function of conversion for Catalyst A and C and shows that the reference catalyst produced more heavy gasoline product. FIG. 6 compares yield of the heavy gasoline fraction as a function of conversion for Catalysts A and Catalyst B. Surprisingly, the yield of the heavy gasoline fraction is similar to reference Catalyst A while the RON of the light gasoline fraction is improved with Catalyst B. FIGS. 7, 8, 9 and 10 compare the iso to normal ratios of the C₅ and C₆ hydrocarbons produced by use of Catalysts A, B and C. In each of these cases, Catalysts B and C produced products having a higher iso to normal ratio than the products produced by use of Catalyst A. FIG. 11 compares the iso to normal ratio of the C₅, C₆, C₇, C₈ and C₉ hydrocarbons as a function of carbon number for Catalyst A and Catalyst B. The products obtained using Catalyst B showed a higher iso to normal ratio for C₅, C₆, C₇, C₈ and C₉ hydrocarbons, thus indicating higher octane products. FIGS. 12 and 13 show the yield of C₃ products as a function of conversion for Catalysts A, B and C. Catalyst C showed a slight increase in C₃ products, as compared to Catalyst A, while Catalyst B was similar to Catalyst A in the yield of C₃ products. Thus, the above results demonstrate that the RON of the light gasoline fraction was improved by use of Catalyst B and Catalyst C and the iso to normal ratio of C₅ to C₉ products increased while the yield of the light gasoline and heavy gasoline fractions remained substantially unchanged or increased. Thus the octane number of the light gasoline fraction obtained using the SAPO containing catalyst was increased relative to the same catalyst but without a SAPO component. The results also indicate that Catalyst B containing SAPO 11 was superior to Catalyst C containing SAPO 34 in its improvement of the octane number of the light gasoline products without a gasoline yield loss. SAPO 11 is characterized by the above discussed adsorption of isobutane while SAPO 34 is not and, accordingly, SAPO 11 is in the preferred class of NZ MSs employed in this invention. A catalyst was prepared employing SAPO 11 to demonstrate the hydrocracking and dewaxing functionality of the catalysts of this invention. SAPO 11 was prepared according to the procedure described in example 18 of U.S. Patent NO. 4,440,871, except the final molar ratio of di n propylamine to Al₂O₃ was 1.0 to 1. The catalyst was prepared by mixing 150 grams of SAPO 11 with 100 grams of Kaiser medium density alumina and a sufficient amount of water to form an extrudate mixture paste . The mixture was extruded into 1 16 inch extrudates and dried in air at 100 C for 16 hours. The extrudates were then calcined in air at 480 C for 2 hours. The extrudates 153 gram were then mixed pore filled with 150 cc of an aqueous solution containing 40.0 grams of nickel nitrate hexahydrate and 48.8 grams of ammonium metatungstate. The mixture was then dried for 16 hours at 100 C and then calcined in air at 480 C for 2 hours. The catalyst was prepared to contain, given as the weight percent oxide 5 wt. NiO 23 wt. WO₃ 36 wt. SAPO 11 and 36 Al₂O₃. Chemical analysis for NiO and WO₃ gave 5.4 wt. NiO and 23.0 wt. WO₃. The catalyst was evaluated by contacting a selected feedstock with hydrogen at a total pressure of 138.8 bar 2000 psig at a Liquid Hourly Space Velocity LHSV of one and a hydrogen flow rate of 10,000 SCFB Standard Cubic Feed per Barrel at temperatures between about 371.1 C 700 F and 448.9 C 840 F . Products boiling below 315.5 C 600 F were collected and evaluated and the conversion given based on these products. The feedstock employed in this example was a vacuum gas oil having an IBP Initial Boiling Point of 293.3 C 560 F and a FBP Final Boiling Point of 620.0 C 1148 F both determined by ASTM test method D 2887 , API Gravity of 22.3 and having a pour point of greater than 35.0 C 95 F . The feedstock was characterized by the following physical and chemical characteristics The reactor effluents were collected and the fraction of the feed weight basis converted to products boiling below 315.5 C 600 F determined by simulated distillation. The conversion is reported as the weight percent of feedstock converted to products boiling below 315 C 600 F . The pour points were determined according to ASTM test method D 97 66 on the reactor effluent after maintaining the effluent at about 54.5 C 130 F during its collection. The conversion and pour point were as follows. The above data demonstrate the conversion of the higher boiling feedstock to lower boiling products in the presence of hydrogen and that such products are characterized by a lower pour point than the initial feedstock.
