# IMPROVEMENTS IN AND RELATING TO ELECTRICAL POWER SUPPLIES

## Abstract
A power supply suitable for energising an isolation ampli fier requiring its input section to be isolated electrically from its output section. The power supply consists of a primary circuit, which, when energised by an electrical supply, converts the electrical energy to infrared radiation, and a secondary circuit which includes a solar cell 1 or cells arranged to receive the infrared radiation. Electrical energy is generated by the solar cell or cells when irradiated. The primary circuit of the power supply includes a plurality of infrared emitting diodes 2 which are energised electrically to provide infrared radiation. The cur rent produced by the solar cell or cells in response to the radi ation is applied to a regulating circuit.
