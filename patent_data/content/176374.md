# Illuminating means for electrophotographic copier apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention concerns an electrostatic copying machine with an imaging system within the housing includ ing a rotary electrophotographic member, means for charg ing progressive areas of the electrophotographic member, means for selectively discharging the electrophotographic member progressively to apply a latent image thereon, means progressively illuminating and prolecting and project ing the pattern of an original patterned member to the progressively charged areas of the electrophotographic member means for toning the latent image progressively means for progressively transferring the toned image to a carrier medium sheet moving synchronously with said electrophotographic member and means for moving the sheet after transfer out of the front wall of the housing a transparent platen in the top wall, least one lamp arranged transverse of the top wall below the platen and laterally thereof illuminating the original member through the platen from the bottom thereof and means for changing the axial aspect of the lamp to vary the illumination of the original member thereby.
