Also disclosed are the 11 substituted estrone, 11 substituted estradiol, 3 acyloxy and 3hydroxy steroids XIX, XX, XXI, XXII, XIXEt, XX Et, XXI Et and XXII Et . DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The 11 hydroxy 19 norandrostenediones A are known to those skilled in the art or can be readily prepared from known steroids by methods well known to those skilled in the art. The 11 hydroxy 19 norandrostenedlones A are oxidized to the corresponding 11 keto 19norandrostenedione B by methods well known to those skilled in the art using such reagents as chromium trioxide, N bromoacetamide in pyridine or lead tetra acetate, see Steroid Reactions, edited by C.Djerassi, Holden Day, Inc., San Francisco, 1963, Chapter 2. Either 11a or 11p hydroxy steroids may be used as both produce the same 11keto compound B . The 11 keto 19 norandrostenediones B are 3,11,17 triones and therefore preferably have the 3 and 17 keto functionality protected prior to further reaction at C1l. The selective protection of carbonyl groups is well known to those skilled in the art, see SteroidReactions, supra, Chapter 1. It is preferred that the 3 and 17 keto functionality be protected as the 3,17 bisethylene glycol ketal to produce the protected 11 keto steroid C . The protected ll keto steroid C is then converted to a 11 methoxymethylene steroid D by a Wittig reaction with methoxymethyltriphenylphosphonium chloride, see Preparation 3 and 3 .The reaction of the protected 11 keto steroid C with the methoxymethyltrtphenylphosphonium chloride must be performed under strictly dry conditions in an inert atmosphere preferably dry nitrogen . The phosphonium salt is dried under reduced pressure at about 600 for about 20 hr. The equipment is dried at about 1100 for at least 24 hr. The organic solvents such as toluene, benzene, diethyl ether or THF should be from a freshly opened bottle or dried and freshly distilled. The 11 methoxymethylene steroid D is converted to the corresponding 11p formyl steroid I in which the protecting groups atC3 and C17 have been removed by reaction with an acid. Inorganic as well as organic acids are operable, but inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric are preferred. Acetic, trifluoroacetic, benzoic, p fluorobenzolc, p methylbenzoic, nltrobenzoic o, m and p acids are all operable. The reaction is preferably conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere at 20 250 though higher and lower temperatures are operable. The 11ss formyl steroid I is transformed into the corresponding 11ss difluoromethyl II , E fluoromethylene III and Z 11fluoromethylene steroid Z by reaction with a fluorinating agent.The fluorinating agents include, for example diethylaminosulfur trifluoride DAST , sulfur tetrafluoride catalyzed with hydrogen fluoride and selenium tetrafluoride as is well known to those skilled in the art. DAST is the preferred fluorinating agent. The 113 formyl I starting material is dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent such as methylene chloride, toluene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, acetonitrile, pyridine, or mixtures thereof. The mixture is degassed and placed under an Inert atmosphere, preferably nitrogen. The fluorinating agent is added. The mixture is stirred at 10.700, preferably 20 250 until the reaction is complete as measured by TLC .Additional n uorinating agent may have to be added if necessary. The reaction may take 2 96 hr depending on temperature, fluorinating agent, the particular lip fornyl compound, solvent s etc. When the reaction is complete water and ice and an organic solvent are added.The organic layer is separated, washed, dried and concentrated to give a solid. The solid is chromatographed on a silica gel column. The appropriate fractions are pooled and concentrated to give the 11ss difluoromethyl steroid II , the E 11 fluoromethylene steroid III and the Z 41 fluoromethylene steroid Z and further purified as necessary by crystallization. For a good discussion of the nomenclature E and Z regarding the cis trans stereochemistry of double bonded compound see J. Chem. Documentation 8, 30 1968 . In the fluorinating reaction both the 1113 difluoromethyl II , E 11 fluoromethylene III and Z 11 fluoromethylene products Z are produced, the ratio of which will vary depending on which solvent is used. For example, If acetonitrile with a little water is used the predominate product is the E .11 fluoromethylene steroid III . The E isomer is always produced in greater amounts than the corresponding Z isomer. With acetonitrile, while the E isomer still predominates, the Z isomer is produced in a higher ratio than with other solvents and it is produced to the extent that it can be isolated. The 11ss difluoromethyl steroid II , and the E 11fluoromethylene steroid III are both 17 keto steroids which for optimum pharmacologlcal activity are converted to the corresponding 17 hydroxy 17 substituted compounds VII, VIII, XVII, XVIII, VII ,VIII , XVII and XVIII respectively . Prior to converting the 17keto group to the desired 17ss hydroxy 17 alpha substituent, the 3 keto group must be protected. It can be protected as an enol ether, enamine, ketal or thio ketal as is well known to those skilled in the art. See, Steroid Reactions, supra, Chapter 1.The steroids of the present invention are 19 nor or estrones and protection of the C3 ketone as an enol ether, enamine or ketal results in a mixture of A4,A5 and AS lo Isomers of the C3 protected 11ss difluoromethyl II , and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids III . The thio ether protecting group is preferred with the 11ss difluoromethyl series because it is produced selectively at C3 In high yfeld. The enol ether, enamine and ketal C3 protecting groups are operable, but are produced in low yield and are difficult to purify because of the double bond isomers A5 and a5 10 . The thio ketal products are obtained pure from the reaction mixture.Therefore, the thio ketal is the preferred protecting group when producing the C3 protected 11 .difluoromethyl and E 11fluoromethylene steroids IV and IV respectively . Enamines are good protecting groups because they form selectively at C3. When the protecting group is an enamine, it is preferred that it be the pyrrolidine enamine. With the E and Z isomers in the fluoromethylene series IV and IV , it is preferred that the C3 protecting group be an enamine. The C3 protected 11ss difluoromethyl, E .11.fluoromethylene steroids IV and IV are then reacted with the appropriate reagent, as is well known to those skilled in the art, to produce the corresponding 17ss hydroxy 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoro methylene steroids V and V respectively . For example, to produce 17 alpha ethynyl 17ss hydroxy 11ss di fl uoromethyl or E 11 fl uoromethyl ene steroids V and V respectively where R17 is an ethynyl group C CH , the C3 protected 11ss difluoromethyl or E 11 fluoromethylene steroid IV and IV respectively are reacted with acetylene in the usual manner, see Example 4.To produce the 17fl hydroxy l7a propynyl steroids V and V where R17 is an alkynyl group such as propynyl C C CH3 the C3 protected 11ss difluoromethyl or E 11 fluoromethylene steroid IV and IV respectively is reacted with the appropriate propynyl Grignard reagent as is well known to those skilled in the art, see Example 6. Similarly, the 17 ketone can be reacted with methyl Grignard reagent and other lower alkyl Grignard reagents to afford the 17 alpha methyl or lower alkyl derivatives V andV . The 17 ketone can also be reduced with agents such as sodium borohydride in alcohol at 00 to give the 17ss hydroxy 11ss difluoro methyl or E 11 fluoromethylene steroids V and V where R17 is a hydrogen atom.The free 17ss hydroxyl group can be esterified or etherified by known procedures. The 17ss hydroxy 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids V and V can be converted to the corresponding 17 substituted ether or ester 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroid VI and VI by methods well known to those skilled in the art for forming ethers and esters. Ethers can be formed by reaction of the 17ss hydroxy steroid V and V with an alkyl halide such as methyl iodide in the usual manner, see Example 8, 40 and 42.Likewise, 17ss hydroxy steroids V and V can be esterified by reaction with pyridine preferably catalyzed with dimethylaminopyridine and the appropriate anhydride see Examples 36 and 38 . Both the 17ss hydroxy 11 difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethyl ene steroids V and V and the 17ss substituted 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids VI and VI can be converted to the corresponding 3 unsubstituted 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11fluoromethylene steroid VII and VII by the process of Examples 10 and 11 respectively. The thiol ketal protecting group at Cs is removed by use of sodium and ammonia. For a more detailed explanation of the removal of the C3 protecting thiol ketal group, see Steroids 30, 481 1977 , In particular page 504.Even though both t3 and A4 3unsubstituted 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene VII andVII steroids are produced, only the 4 isomer has sufficient biological activity to be useful for the pharmacological utility disclosed. The thiol ketal protecting group at C3 may be hydrolyzed off from the 17ss hydroxy V and V as well as the 17ss substituted VI and VI steroids to produce the corresponding A4 3 keto 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids VIII and VIII by reaction with methyl iodide, water and acetone. See Examples 5, 7, 9, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41 and 43. An alternative method of producing the 3 unsubstituted 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids VII and VII is set forth in Chart E. The process involves starting with the C3 protected 118 di fl uo romethyl and E 11 fl uoromethyl ene steroids IV and IV and protecting the Cl7 ketone functionality as the ketal to produce the 3,17 diprotected 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11fluoromethylene steroids IX and IX , selectively reducing off the C3 thiol ketal protecting group to produce the C17 protected 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids X and X .Here it is useful to protect the steroid at C3 as the thio ketal to maintain the A4 double bond and the C17 ketone as the ketal so that the C3 protecting group can be selectively eliminated producing theC17 protected 11ss difluoromethyl or E 11 fluoromethyl ene steroid X and X . In this reaction also produced is the A3 protected 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids XI and XI .The mixture of the C17 protected X and X and a3 protected XI andXI steroids is further reacted, as a mixture, by removal of the C17ketal protecting group by methods well known to those skilled in the art to produce the 3 unsubstituted 17 keto 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids XII and XII as well as the correspond ing A3 11 dIfluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids XIII and XIII .Next the 3 unsubstituted 17 keto 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroid XII and XII is reacted such that the 17 keto group is transformed to the corresponding 17 substituted 17fl hydroxy functionality to produce the desired 3 unsubstituted 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroid VII and VII . The 17p hydroxy group can then be transformed to the corresponding ether or ester as was described previously. Hence, there are two alterna tive procedures to produce the 3 unsubstituted 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids VII and VII starting with C3protected 11 difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids IV and IV respectively . Charts F and F disclose the transformation of 11ss difluoro methyl 17 keto steroid II and E 11 fluoromethylene 17 keto steroid III to the corresponding 5 10 3 keto 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids XVII and XVII and the 4,9 11ss di fluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids XVIII and XVIII .The appropriate 17 keto steroid II or III has the C3 ketone protected as the ketal. By using the ketal as a protecting group rather than the thlol ketal, mixtures of the 5 10 isomer XIV andXIV and t5 isomer XV and XV are produced as previously discussed.The transformation of the 11 keto steroid B to the protected 11 keto steroid C uses ethylene glycol, p TSA at reflux for 3 6 hr to produce the 3,17 bis ketal, see Preparation 2 and Example 24. The transformation of the 11ss difluoromethyl 17 keto steroid II to the 5 10 17 keto 11ss difluoromethyl steroid XIV and 5 17 keto 11ss d ifluoromethyl steroid XV uses only 25 the amount of p TSA as used in Preparation 2 and Example 24 and the reaction Is conducted at 0 250 to minimize the amount of bis ketal formation, see Example 19.The 5 10 17 keto llss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethyl ene steroids XIV and XIV are next reacted as previously described to transform the 17 keto group to appropriate propargyl alcohol at C17 to produce the 5 10 C3 protected 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fl uoromethyl ene steroid XVI and XVI . Upon removal of the C3 ketal protecting group to produce the 3 keto functionality, a 5 10 3 keto 11ss difluorome thyl or E 11 fluoromethylene steroid XVII and XVII is formed.The ketal is hydrolyzed without isomerization of the double bond, seeSynthesis 63 1978 . The 5 10 3 keto 11ss difluoromethyl or E 11 fluoromethylene steroid XVII and XVII Is converted to the corresponding 4,9 diene by bromination, dehydrobromination as described in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 82, 2402 1960 to obtain the A4 9 lle difluoromethyl or E 11.fluoromethylene steroid XVIII and XVIII . Just as the 17 keto 11ss difluoromethyl steroids II and the E 11 fluoromethyl steroids III are converted to the corresponding pharmacologically active 17ss hydroxy 17 alpha substituted compounds VII,VII , VIII, VIII , XVII, XVII , XVIII and XVIII by the processes described above, similarly the 17 keto Z 11 fEuoromethylene steroid Z is converted to the corresponding 17 3 hydroxy 17.substltuted pharmacologically active steroids VII , VIII , XVII and XVIII . The 13ss ethyl steroids Et are produced similarly to the 13ss methyl steroids. A 13ss ethyl 11 hydroxy steroid A Et is oxidized to a 13ss ethyl 11 keto steroid B Et which is then transformed to a protected 13ss ethyl 11 keto steroid C Et which is then transformed to a 138 ethyl ll methoxymethyiene steroid D Et and ultimately to a 13ss ethyl 11ss formyl steroid 1 Et , see Examples 59 and 60. The 13ss ethyl 11ss formyl steroid I Et is fluorinated to produce a mixture of 13ss ethyl 11ss difluoromethyl II Et , 13ss ethy E 11 fluoromethylene III Et and 13ss ethyl Z 11 fluoromethylene Z Et, see Chart B Et.The 13ss Et 11ss difluoromethyl II Et , E 11 fluoromethylene III Et and Z .11 fluoromethylene Z Et are converted to the correspondingC3 protected form IV Et , see Chart C Et, where R11 represents the 11ss difluoromethyl, E 11 fluoromethylene and Z 11 fluoromethylene group, see Chart D Et. The 13ss ethyl steroid intermediates II Et,III Et, Z Et, IV Et are transformed to the pharmacologically active 13ss ethyl steroids VII Et, VIII Et, XVII Et and XVIII Et by the same process chemistry as the corresponding 13ss methyl steroids II, III,Z, IV, IV and IV , see Charts D Et thru I Et. The process chemistry of the present invention involves the use of reactions well known to those skilled In the art. These reactions, each well known to those skilled in the art, are arranged in a novel manner to produce the novel compounds of the present invention. The 11ss fonmyl I , 11ss difluoromethyl II, IV and XII and the E 11.fluoromethylene III, IV and XII steroids are intermediates useful in production of the pharmacologically active 11ss difluoro methyl VII, VIII, XVII and XVIII and E 11 fluoromethylene VII ,VIII , XVII and XVIII steroids. The Z 11 fluoromethylene Z, IV and XII steroids are useful as intermediates in the production of the pharmacologically active Z 11 fluoromethylene VII , VIII , XVII and XVIII steroids. The 13B ethyl steroids II Et, III Et, Z Et, IV Et and XII Et are useful as intermediates in the production of the pharmacologically active 13B ethyl VII Et, VIII Et, XVII Et and XVIII Et steroids. The 11ss difluoromethyl II and II Et , E 11 fluoromethylene III and III Et and Z 11 fluoromethylene Z and Z Et steroids are converted to the corresponding 11 substituted estrone XIX and XIX Et as is well known to those skilled in the art. The 11 substituted estrone XIX and XIX Et is transformed to the corresponding 11 substituted estradiol XX and XX Et with a ketone reducing agent as is well known to those skilled in the art. SeeSteroid Reactions, Carl Djerassi, Holden Day Inc., San Francisco 1963,Chapter 1. Preferred is sodium borohydride. The 4 3 keto 11ss difluoromethyl, 4 3 keto E 11 fluoromethylene and t4 3 keto Z 11 fluoromethylene steroids VIII,VIII , VIII and VIII Et are transformed to the corresponding 3ss hydroxy steroid XXII and XXII Et by way of the enol acylate intermediate, the 3 acyloxy steroid XXI and XXI Et is reduced by sodium borohydride in aqueous ethanol as is well known to those skilled in the art. The 11 substituted estrone XIX and XIX Et are useful both as an intermediate in production of the pharmacologically active 11 substituted estradiol XX and XX Et and also because of its own pharmacological activity. The 3 acyloxy steroids XXI and XXI Et are useful as intermediates in the production of the pharmacologically active 3ss hydroxy steroid XXII and XXII Et . The 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids VII,VIII, XVII, XVIII, VII , VIII , XVII and XVIII respectively have progestational, antiprogestational and male and female antifertility activity and therefore are useful for pregnancy salvage and menopausal therapy and as male and female contraceptive agents in humans and other mammals. The 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids VII, VIII, XVII, XVIII, VII , VIII , XVII and XVIII respectively may be used either individually or in combination with each other. The 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids VII,VIII, XVII, XVIII, VII , VIII , XVII and XVIII which have female progestational activity and are useful in treating pregnancy salavage and menopausal therapy as progestins are those 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11.fluoromathylene steroids VII, VIII, XVII, XVIII, VII , VIII , XVI I and XVIII which have similar activity to progesterone in the following tests DAO diamine oxidase , McPhail, pregnancy maintenance in castrated laboratory animals as is well known to those skilled in the art, see for DAO Assay, A New Progestational Assay UterineDiamine Oxidase, Fertility and Sterility 1976 by M.

The 11 3 difluoromethyl and E .11.fluoromethylene steroids VII, VII I, XVII, XVIII, VII , VIII , , XVII and XVIII useful for treating pregnancy salvage or in menopausal therapy are administered so that the female mammal receives about 0.002 to about 0.50 mg kg day or for a 50 kg female, the amount would be about 0.1 to about 25 mg day, preferably from about 1 to about 5 mg day. The 11 3 difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids VII,VIII, XVII, XVIII, VII , VIII , XVII and XVIII respectively which have either progestational or anti progestational activity are useful as male and female contraceptive agents and are used to provide reversible contraception for male and female mammals post puberty which are selected from the group consisting of man, male dog, tom, bull, stallion, ram, boar, male rat and male mouse and their female counterparts. With regards to the human, there are many instances in which the female cannot take various types of chemical contraceptive agents and does not or cannot use various physical contraceptive devices such as IUD IUCD or diaphragm. In addition, many women do not wish to rely on non prescription over the counter foams, gels and cream chemical contraceptive agents. Therefore, there are numerous instances in which it would be highly desirable to have a reliable reversible contraceptive agent for men. This is particularly true in view of the fact that the only reversible contraceptive agent for man is a mechanical device prophylactic which has the distinct disadvantage of low efficacy. In addition, there is the disadvantage of mechanical devices of having to interrupt intercourse to properly position the device. The useful warm blooded animals can be divided into two groups domesticated dog, tom and commercial bull, stallion, ram and boar .The domesticated male animals usually cohabitate with the females.The commercial male animals are usually separated from the females because either it is desired that the particular males not fertilize the females so that artificial insemination may be used, or even if the particular males are well suited to fertilizing the females it may be desired that they not do so at the present time. The use of the methods of the present invention permits one to allow both the domestic and commercial male and females to cohabitate without sterilization of either sex and without unwanted pregnancies and still retain the flexibility of fertili7ing the female when desired either with a desired male or by artificial insemination. With regards to the rodents, the rat and mouse, it is highly desirable of course to be able to eradicate or control the populations of these rodents with the methods of the present invention. These rodents can be controlled and or eradicated by decreasing the fertility of these rodents by use of the methods of the present invention. This of course would not eliminate the rodents which are present, but only future rodents which these animals might conceive, thereby decreasing future populations of these undesirable animals. The 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids VII,VIII, XVII, XVIII, VII , VIII , XVII and XVIII which are useful as male contraceptive agents are those which depress gonadotropins In castrated laboratory animals. See, Fed. Proc. 18, 1057 1959 . The 11ss difluoromethyl steroids VII, VI II, XVII and XVIII are administered such that the male mammal receives about 0.01 to about 1.0 mg kg day. For a 70 kg male, the amount would be about 0.7 to about 70 mg day. The E fluoromethylene steroids VII , VIII , XVII , XVIII which are useful as male contraceptive agents are administered such that the male mammal receives about 0.001 to about 1.0 mg kg day. for a 70 kg male, the amount would be about 0.07 to about 70 mg day. The 11fl difluoromethyl steroids VII, VI II, XVII and XVIII useful as female contraceptive agents are those 11p difluoromethyl steroids VII, VIII, XVII and XVIII with anti progestational activity, i.e., those compounds which inhibit the action of progesterone in the following tests DAO, nuclear translocation, expression of uteroglobin gene, and most importantly interruption of pregnancy in laboratory animals as is well known to those skilled in the art, see for DAO assay supra. Those llss difluoromethyl steroids VII, VIII, XVII and XVIII are administered such that the female mammal receives about 0.01 to about 1.0 mg kg day. For a 50 kg female, the amount would be about 0.5 to about 50 mgiday. The E 11 fluoromethylene steroids VII , VIII , XVII andXVIII which are useful as female contraceptive agents are those E 11 fluoromethylene steroids VII , VIII , XVII and XVIII which have anti progestational activity as identified supra and which are ad.inistered such that the female mammal receives about 0.001 to about 1.0 mg kg day. For a 50 kg female, the amount would be about 0.05 to about 50 mg day. The exact dose of the 11 difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethyl. ene steroids VII, VIII, XVII, XVIII, VII , VIII , XVII and XVIII respectively will depend on the particular compound, the weight, age, and physical condition of the particular patient to be treated. The 118 difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids VII, VIII, XVII, XVIII, VII , VIII , XVII and XVIII respectively contraceptive agents administered by oral, parenteral, in sustained release form, intrauterine, Sntravaginal means in the appropriate dosage forms. Oral dosage forms include both solid and liquid. The solid dosage forms include tablets compressed, tablet triturates, enteric coated, sugar coated, film coated and multiple compressed , capsules hard and soft gelatin , treats, bait, veterinary premix and animal feed. The liquid oral dosage forms include, for example, aqueous solutions elixirs and syrups , emulsions, and suspensions. In the parenteral sustained release form, the actlve Ingredient is slowly released over a prolonged period as is well known to those skilled in the art. These preparations are known as sustained release parenteral forms or depo forms. One method of formulating parenteral depo compositions is to administer the drug dissolved in or suspended in oil. An oleaginous solution or suspension injected intramuscularly provides a depot which slowly releases the drug to tissue fluid and the blood. The oil may be modified by the inclusion of wax or some other water repellant substance such as aluminum stearate which further reduces the release rate of the therapeutically active ingredient. An alternative long acting parenteral composition is one where the relatively water insoluble 11t3 difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids VII, VIII, XVII, XVIII, VII , VIII , XVII and XVIII respectively are suspended in an aqueous medium. The aqueous medium can be modified by the addition of certain hydrocolloids such as gelatin, carboxymethyl cellulose or polyvinylpyrrolidone. The contraceptive steroids of the present invention are quite water insoluble and those which are crystalline lend themselves very well to this type of formulation. Long acting parenteral steroidal compositions in oil are well known to those skilled in the art. For example, see testosterone cypionate USP See Physicians Desk Reference, PDR, 31 edition, 1977, page 1625 nandrolone phenpropionate N.F. PDR, ibid., page 1138 estradiol cypionate injection USP and testosterone enanthate USP PDR, ibid., page 1512 which is advertised as having a duration of action of about 4 weeks. Long acting aqueous parenteral compositions are also well known to those skilled in the art. See British Patents 705,343 and 731,933.Various long acting aqueous parenteral steroidal preparations are well known to those skilled in the art. See British Patent 731,933,Examples 1 4 and methyl prednisol one acetate suspension N.F. PDR, ibid., page 1623 and medroxyprogesterone acetate suspension PDR, ibid., page 1625 . U.S. Patent 4,038,389 discloses and claims aqueous parenteral compositions containing 200 600 mg ml of medroxyprogesterone. The usual therapeutic doge of medroxyprogesterone is 2.5 10 mg, see PDR, ibid., page 1648, where the product is marked in oral tablet form at two dose levels, 2.5 and 10.0 mg. The very high dose of medroxyprogesterone disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,038,389 is obviously because it is in long acting depot form intended to have a duration of action of many weeks. See The Journal of Reproductive Physiology 13, 113 1974 , where the composition claimed in U.S. Patent 4,038,389 had a duration of action of at least 3 months in preventing pregnancy. In 1977 five papers appeared in the journal Contraception, Vol.15, at pages 627, 635, 649, 669 and 679, which show that testosterone can be administered parenterally in a form which will provide effective amounts of testosterone for a period of at least one month. Therefore, the technology is known to those skilled in the art to formulate the 11a difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene contraceptive steroids of the present Invention into depot or long acting parenteral preparations. The depot parenteral preparations should release the male contraceptive steroid at the rate of about 0.01 to about 1.0 mg kg day. An alternative pharmaceutical composition to deliver the 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene contraceptive steroids to the desired animal at a controlled rate over a long period of time is the implant. The technology for formulating the proper implants is well known to those skilled In the art. The J. of Animal Science 35, 251 1972 , in an article by M. L. Ogilvie, describes a polyurethane implant containing mel engesterol acetate which was used in heifers for over four months. John B. Herrick In Animal Nutrition and Health,April 19i7, at page 23, describes a number of growth promotants for beef cattle. Many of these growth promotants are steroids, including testosterone, and are administered by implants. L. L.Ewing et al., in Contraception 13, 583 1976 , describes a method of decreasing sperm counts in male rhesus monkeys by administering testosterone via subdermal dimethylpolysiloxane implants. The implants were left in for 70 days, and the results demonstrate the satisfactory nature of this method. W. E. Johansson et al., in Contraception 13, 287 1976 , describes using dimethylpolysiloxane implants containing a steroid in women for over four months. Further, U.S. Patent 3,896,819 discloses a drug delivery device for administering a drug at a controlled rate for a prolonged period of time. The drug delivery device can be used as an implant, see column 6, starting at line 55. This implant is useful with steroids such as methyl testosterone, see column 19, starting at line 24.The implant should release the 11ss difluoro methyl and E fluoromethylene contraceptive steroids of the present invention at the rate of about 0.01 to about 1.0 mg kg day. The pharmaceutically therapeutically active 11S di fl uo romethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene contraceptive steroids of the present invention are administered orally or parenterally in unit dosage forms or multiple dosage forms. Unit dose forms refer to physically discrete units suitable for human and animal subjects and packaged individually as is known in the art. Each unit dose contains a predetermined quantity of the therapeutically active compound sufff cient to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier, vehicle or diluent.Examples of unit dose forms include ampuls and syringes parenteral and individually packaged tablet or capsule oral solid . Unit dose forms may be administered in fractions or multiples thereof. A multiple dose form is a plurality of identical unit dosage forms packaged in a single container to be administered in segregated unit dose form. Examples of multiple dose forms include vials parenteral and bottles of tablets of capsules oral solid . Hence, multiple dose forms is a multiple of unit doses which are not segregated in packaging.The specifications for the unit dosage form and the multiple dosage form are dictated by and directly dependent on a the unique characteristics of the particular llss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroid IV, VIII, XI or XII and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved and b the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such a therapeutically active compound for reversible contraception. The individual oral solid pharmaceutical dosage forms, tablets and capsules, are packaged individually unit dose or in quantity multiple dose containers , for examples bottles of 50, 100, 500, 1,000 or 5,000. The amount of the llss difluoromethyl and E I1fluoromethylene steroid VII, VIII, XVII, XVIII, VII , VIII , XVII and XVIII. respectively per dosage unit tablet or capsule is adjusted so that the tablet or capsule, a fraction or multiple thereof, provides the patient with an effective amount. It is preferred that each tablet or capsule contain 1 250 mg of the 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids VII, VIII, XVI I, XVIII, VII ,. VIII , XVII and XVIII respectively .The exact dosage depends on the particular compound, the age, weight, physical condition and particular patient or animal, as is known to those skilled in the art. Tablets and capsules are given in sufficient number and frequency to obtain the desired contraceptive effect. U.S. Patent 4,252,798 describes various dosage forms useful for a male contraceptive agent. While that patent describes dosage forms useful for a male contraceptive agent, those forms are equally applicable to the female contraceptive steroids of the present invention. U.S. Patent 4,252,798 has a thorough discussion of sustained release tablets and capsules, tablet formulations used to treat dogs, cats and rabbits, treats, bait, liquid dosage forms, veterinary premixes, and animal feed compositions. Following cessation of administration of the 118 difiuoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids VII, VIII, XVII, XVIII, VII ,VIII , XVII and XVIII respectively , or at the end of the metering out of the parenteral sustained release formulation, contraception will be maintained only for a very short period, and gradually, the animal s ability to fertilize or be fertilized returns to normal. The 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethyl ene steroids VII, VIII, XVII, XVIII, VII , VIII , XVII and XVIII are also useful for treating benign prostatic hypertrophy BPH in humans. The steroids are administered in the dosage forms described above and in the dosages previously described. Biological Information in the form of progesterone receptor relative binding affinity data determined according to the procedure of D. Philibert et al, Endocrinology 101, 1850 1977 set forth inTABLE 1 discloses the 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids to be useful as progestins. Biological information in the form of DAO assay data set forth inTABLE 1 discloses the antiprogestational activity of the 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethylene steroids. DAO assay data can be determined according to the procedure of C. H. Spilman et al.Reproductive Processes and Contraception, Plenum Publishing Cop., 1981, p 5030. The Z 11 fluoromethylene steroids VII , VIII , XVII andXVIII are useful in the same way and in the same manner as the corresponding 11ss difluoromethyl and E 11 fluoromethyl ene steroids VII, VIII, XVII, XVIII, VII , VIII , XVII and XVIII . The 13ss ethyl 11ss difluoromethyl, E 11fluoromethylene and Z 11 fluoromethylene steroids VII Et , VIII Et, XVII Et and XVIII Et are useful in the same way and in the same manner as the corresponding 13ss methyl steroids VII, VIII, XVII, XVIII, VII , VIII , XVII ,XVIII , VII , VIII , XVII and XVIII . The 11 substituted estradiol XX , 3ss hydroxy XXII , 13ss 11substituted estradiol XX Et and 13ss 11 substituted 3ss hydroxy XXII Et steroids are useful in the same way and same manner as the corresponding 11ss difluoromethyl, E 11 fluoromethylene and 2 11 fluoromethylene steroids VII, VIII, XVII, XVIII, VII , VIII ,XVII , XVIII , VII , VIII , XVII and XVIII .
