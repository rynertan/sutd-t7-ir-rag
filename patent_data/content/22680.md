## Description
Document handling apparatus and method The present invention relates to document handling apparatus and methods for plurally recirculating a set of simplex original documents to a copier to be copied onto both sides of copy sheets to form pre collated duplex copy sets, by circulating the documents in reverse descending serial page N to 1 order beginning with the last sheet N in the document and ending with the first sheet 1 in the document set. As xerographic and other copiers increase in speed, and become more automatic, it is increasingly important to provide higher speed yet more reliable and more automatic handling of both the copy sheets and the individual original documents being copied.The providing of duplex copying capabilities and precollation copying capabilities greatly complicates and increases the copier document and copy sheet handling complexities. The term duplex copying may be more specifically defined into several different, individually known, copying modes. In duplex duplex copying, both sides of a duplex document sheet which has images on both sides are copied onto both sides of a single copy sheet. In duplex simplex copying, both sides of a duplex document are copied onto only one side of two successive copy sheets. In simplex duplex copying, to which the present invention particularly relates, the images of two successive simplex document sheets, which have images on only one side, are copied onto opposite sides of a single copy sheet. In the printing industry, as opposed to the copier industry, twosided copying may be referred to as backing up rather than duplex copying. a a set of duplex documents or copy sheets, odd pages 1, 3, 5, etc., will typically appear on the first sides, with even pages 2, 4, 6, etc., on the second sides, respectively. If there are an odd number of pages in the set of duplex sheets the backside of the last sheet will typically be blank empty . In contrast, in a set of simplex document or copy sheets, the number of the sheet will typically also correspond to the page number. Thus, an odd number of simplex document sheets will normally have an odd number of page images. The duplex copying of the copy sheets for either duplex duplex or simplex duplex copying may be done by first making in the copier processor a set of simplexed copy sheets printed only on their first sides of only the odd or the even document pages and temporarily storing those simplex copy sheets in a duplex buffer tray, and then feeding them back through the same copying processor for a second pass printing of the opposite order even or odd page document images on the opposite sides of the copy sheets. Such systems may be referred to as sequential or dual pass duplexing systems. Examples of such systems for handling the copy sheets being duplexed are shown in U. S. PatentsNos. 3,615,129, issued October 26, 1971 to W. A. Drawe, et al. 3,645,615, issued February 29, 1972, toM. R. Spear, Jr. and 3,851,754, issued October 15, 1974, to E. E. Drexler et al. on duplex duplex. Of particular interest as disclosing a duplex copying system which is also a pre collation copying system are U. S. Patents Nos. 3,630,607, issued December 28, 1971, to H. Korn and 4,116,558, issued September 26, 1978, by the same assignee in the name of J. A. Adamek et al.. The present invention is an improvement over said Adamek Patent No. 4,116,558 for automatically achieving copying and storage of even page numbered copies of simplex documents in the duplex buffer tray to avoid variable output inversion or copying of a blank page when an odd number of simplex documents are being duplex copied, as indicated in that patent to be desirable, and for achieving this feature under the further difficulty of copying the documents in reverse decending serial page order with a different type of document handling system. The description beginning with the last paragraph of Column 8 of said Adamek U.S. Patent is particularly noted by way of background for this application. A desirable feature for a copier is to provide automatic document recirculation for pre collation copying. As discussed, for example, in detail in U. S.Patent No. 3,963,345, issued June 15, 1976, to D. J.Stemmle, et al., at Columns 1 4, and the above citedAdamek patent, such pre collation copying systems provide a number of important advantages. The copies exit the copier in pre collated sets, and do not require subsequent sorting in a sorter or collator. Any desired number of such copy sets may be made by making a corresponding number of recirculations of the document set in collated order past a copying station and copying each document once each time it recirculates. On line finishing and or removal of the completed copy sets may be provided while additional copy sets are being made from the same document set. However, a disadvantage of pre collation copying systems is that the documents must all be repeatedly circulated, and copied in a pre determined order only once in each circulation, by a number of circulations equivalent to the desired number of copy sets. Thus, it may be seen that increased document handling is necessitated for a pre collation copying system, as compared to a conventional post collation copying system. Maximizing document handling automation and copying cycle efficiency is particularly important in precollation copying. If the document handler cannot circulate and copy documents in coordination with the copy sheets in the correct order, the total copying time for each copy set will be increased. In a post collation copying system, all the desired copies are made at one time from each document page and collated by being placed in separate sorter bins. The document set need only be circulated once and multiply copied to fill bins of the copy sheet sorter or collator with the corresponding number of copy sets desired. However, the number of copy sets which can be made in one circulation is limited by the number of available bins, and the sorter adds space and complexity and is not well suited for on line finishing. Some examples of art relating to pre collation document handling systems of the type disclosed herein, in which each document sheet is withdrawn from the bottom of a document set stack for copying once in each circulation and then returned to the top of the document stack for repeated copying circulations include German Patentschrift 1,128,295, 25 October 1962 and U. S. Patents Re. 27,976, originally U. S.3,499,710, issued March 10, 1970 to L. W. Sahley U.S.3,536,320, issued October 27, 1970, to D. R. Derby U. S. 3,552,739, issued January 5, 1971, to R. R.Roberts, et al. U. S. 3,556,511, issued January 19, 1971, to A. Howard, et al. U. S. 3,888,579, issuedJune 10, 1975, to V. Rodek et al. and U. S.3,937,454, issued February 10, 1976, to R. H. Colwill.A recent example of a pre collation copying system of this type, with circuitry and switches for counting the number of documents recirculated and for counting the completion of each set circulation, and face up loading of the document stack, is shown in U. S. PatentNo. 4,076,408, issued February 28, 1978, to M. G. Reid et al., and in the U. S. Patent Office Defensive Publication T957,006 of April 5, 1977, based on applicationSerial No. 671,865, also filed March 30, 1976, byM.G. Reid, et al.. Other examples of document sheet sensors are disclosed in U. S. Patent 3,790,158, issuedFebruary 5, 1974, to J. E. Summers et al.. A recent example of an N to 1 order duplex or simplex pre collation copying document recirculation system is disclosed in article No. 16332, pp. 49 52 of the November 1977 issue of Research Disclosure , published by Industrial Opportunities, Ltd., Homewell,Havant, Hampshire, U. K.. A corresponding U. S. application No. 813,041, was filed July 5, 1977 and its equivalent U. K. application No. 2,000,749A was published 17 January 1979. Further examples of copier systems with document and sheet handling control systems are described in U. S. Patent Nos. 4,062,061, issued December 6, 1977, to P. J. Batchelor et al. 4,078,787, issued March 14, 1978, to L. E. Burlew et al. 4,099,150, issued July 4, 1978, to J. L. Conin 4,123,155, issued October 31, 1978, to W. L.

Document handling apparatus according to the invention is characterized by odd even determining means for automatically determining whether there are an odd or an even number of original documents in said document set before they are copied, and copying control means, controlled by said odd even determining means, to inhibit copying of the last, or next to last, and alternate subsequent documents on the first copying circulation of said document set in response to a determination by said odd even determining means whether there is an odd or even number of original documents in said set, to provide properly collated output duplex copy sets. Preferably said odd even determining means comprises means to circulate the document set once before it is copied and count the number of sheets in that non copying circulation. A method according to the invention is characterised by the steps of automatically determining whether there are an odd or an even number of simplex original documents in said document set by counting the simplex documents as they are so circulated before they are copied in the first copying circulation of the document set, copying in said N to.l order only the last Nth and subsequent alternate simplex documents or alternatively only copying the next to last N minus 1 and subsequent alternate simplex documents automatically in response to said determining of whether there are an odd or even number of simplex documents in said set, and in all intermediate copying circulations of the document set, copying all of said simplex documents in said N to 1 order, and in the last copying circulation of the document set, copying the alternate simplex documents not copied on said first copying circ ulation, to provide properly collated output duplex copy sets with consistent copy output inversion. It is a preferred feature of tie invention to place a set of simplex original document sheets in a collated face up stack of 1 to N page order which are individually circulated from the bottom of the stack to the platen of a copier and back to the top of said stack in N to 1 order, with N being the page number of the bottom page of said document stack, wherein said odd even determining means determines whether N is an odd or even page number, and wherein if N is an odd number, the document sheets are copied in the first copying circulation as controlled by said copying control means in the copying order sequenceN minus 1, N minus 3, N minus 5, etc., up to the total number of document sheets in said document set, and in at least the second copying circulation all the document pages are copied and the Nth document page is first copied on only one side of a copy sheet as a simplex copy and in the last copying circulation that same document set is copied in the copying sequenceN, N minus 2, N minus 4, etc., and wherein if N is an even number, the documents are copied in the first copying circulation in the order N, N minus 2, N minus 4, etc., and copied on the last copying circulation in the order N minus 1, N minus 3, N minus 5, etc.. In order that the invention may be more readily understood reference will now be made to the accompanying drawing in which the single figure is a partial side view of an exemplary copier and a document feeder therefor incorporating the present invention. Referring to the exemplary copier 10 shown in the Figure, and its exemplary automatic document feeding unit 20, it will be appreciated that various other recirculating document feeding units and copiers may be utilized with the present invention, including various ones disclosed in the above cited references. In the recirculating document handler RDH 20 here, individual original documents are sequentially fed from the bottom of a stack of documents placed by the operator face up in the document storage area or stacking tray 24 to the imaging station 26, which is the conventional platen of the copier 10, to be conventionally imaged onto a photoreceptor 12 for the making of copies in a conventional xerographic manner.The document handler 20 has conventional switches such as 29 for sensing and counting the individual documents fed from the tray 24, i.e., counting the number of document sheets circulated. A conventional resettable bail and its associated switch 31 indicates the completion of each circulation of the complete document set and then is automatically reset on the top of the stack before the next circulation. The document feeder 20 is selected or adapted to serially sequentially feed the documents, which may.be conventional sizes and weights of sheets of paper or plastic containing information indicia to be copied, e.g., printed or typed letters, drawings, prints, photographs, etc.. A bottom feeder 32 feeds the bottom document sheet, on demand, to a platen belt 30 which moves the document into registration over the copier platen. In this document feeder 20 each document is inverted as it is fed from the tray 24 to the imaging station 26 around a first inverting path 40. After the document has thus been turned over once at 40 and copied, there is a decision gate 60 in the document path after the downstream end of the platen belt 30 here, comprising pivotable deflector fingers, which determines the further recirculatory movement of the documents through a selected one of two different return transport paths back to the tray 24. These two paths are a first simplex transport path 54 and a second duplex transport path 58. The second or duplex transport path 58 returns the documents to their storage area 24 for restacking with effectively only a single inversion. In contrast, the first or simplex transport path 54 transports the documents around a second inverting path 54 and returns them to the same restacking tray after having been inverted twice. Therefore, the solenoid or other actuation of the selector gate 60 determines whether the documents are recirculated with a total of one or two inversions. With two inversions the simplex path 54 the same sides of the documents are exposed in each circulation and are restacked in the tray 24 in each circulation in their original orientation. With one inversion the duplex path 58 the documents are restacked in the tray 24 inverted from their previous orientation, which provides for copying of the opposite sides or faces of the documents on their next circulation. This is only used for copying duplex documents. The exemplary duplex path transport 58 here is provided by a reversable three roller sheet inverter as shown. Both the simplex transport 54 and duplex transport 58 continuously restack the sheets after they are copied on the top of the stack of sheets in the tray 24. Thus, continuous multiple recirculations for precollation copying can be provided. The exemplary copier 10 processor and its controller 100 will be described in further detail.It provides duplex or simplex pre collated copy sets from either duplex or simplex original documents copied by the RDH 20. Two separate copy sheet trays 106 and 107 are provided here to feed clean copy sheets onto which the images of the documents are to be printed.The control of sheet feeding is by the machine controller 100. The controller 100 is preferably of the known programmable microprocessor type exemplified by the patents cited in the introduction, which conventionally also controls all of the other machine functions described herein including the operation of the document feeder, the document and copy sheet gates, feeder drives, etc.. For pre printed or blank covers or other noncopy inserts additional inserter trays such as 108 can be provided, if desired, for direct output without printing, but interleaved with the copies. The copy sheets are fed from trays 106 or 107 to the conventional xerographic transfer station 112 for imaging one side thereof, then to the conventional fusing station 114. From there, depending on the position of a duplex selector finger or gate 118, the copy sheets will be deflected either into a duplex buffer intermediate storage tray 116 for duplex copies, or into the copy output path of the copier via an output transport 126. The copy sheets stacked into the duplex tray 116 are stacked image face up in the order in which they were copied. The duplex tray 116 here includes a bounce reverser 120 and jogger normal force wheels 122 for assisting the stacking of copy sheets therein and assistance in bottom feeding from the duplex tray 116 by a bottom feeder 124. For duplex copying the previously simplexed copy sheets in the tray 116 are fed by the feeder 124 back to the transfer station 112 for the imaging of their second or opposite side page image. Such now duplexed copy sheets are then fed out past the now opened gate 118 into the same output transport 126. The output transport 126 transports the finished copy sheets to an output tray, or, preferably, to a finishing station 140 for the stapling, stitching, gluing, binding, and or off set stacking of the completed, precollated, copy sets. The copy sheet may be stacked in the finisher in a compilier tray in the order produced without an inverter with the system disclosed here. By way of further background, a known problem with reproducing machines which must do both simplexing and duplexing is the maintaining of proper collation of the copy sheets in the output tray. For example, for simplex copy sheets generated in reverse serial order, the copy sheets would be properly collated if they are output stacked in that order N to 1 , and stacked face up in the output tray. Thus, when the operator picks up the stacked set of completed copy sheets, it will be in the proper forward serial page order 1 to N from the top of the stack to the bottom.The same is true for duplex copies, wth the additional requirement that a lower document page number be on the top of the copy sheet and the next higher document page number be on the bottom of the same copy sheet, so that the completed duplex copy set is in the order 1 2 3 4 5 6 etc.. A difficulty is that most dual pass duplex copying systems inherently have an inversion of a duplex copy sheet within the processor as the duplex copy sheet is returned to the transfer station from the duplex tray for the printing of the second side image onto the back of the duplex copy sheet.Thus, typically a duplexed copy sheet receives one more inversion than a simplexed copy sheet. Accordingly, the output path for a simplex copy sheets is typically different i.e., contains one more or one less inversions than the output path for duplex copy sheets in order to maintain the proper collation order of the output sheets. It is known that this creates a particular problem when there is an odd number of document pages to be copied onto a duplex copy set. In that case, the last page of the set of duplexed copies is really a simplex copy, because with an odd number of original document pages the last copy sheet page in the copy set will only have an image on one side thereof, and the other side will be blank. It is known from the above cited Adamak patent, for example, to be undesirable to run this last duplex copy sheet page through the transfer station for the pseudo printing of a blank image on the backside thereof in order to obtain an additional inversion, since this wastes processing time and also can cause undesirable background contamination of the blank backside of this last page sheet. This can be avoided by printing a last odd page of the duplex copy set on only one side of a clean copy sheet fed from a copy sheet tray, rather than from the duplex buffer tray, i.e., only running this particular copy sheet through the processor once. However, this results in the last duplex copy sheet having a different number of inversions, and, therefore, apparently requiring its inversion in order to maintain its collation with the rest of the duplex copy sheets if copied in forward serial order. This inversion adds an additional time delay and potential paper jam site, as well as the additional expense of the inverter mechanism. Further, in order to treat the last duplex page differently, it is necessary to know whether an odd or even page number document is being copied. That is easy to know if the documents are copied from page 1, in forward serial order, but not if the first document copied is the last sheet of an unknown number of documents. With the present system, these problems are overcome, and the last odd page of the duplex document set can be copied on only one side of a clean sheet fed from a copy sheet tray and fed out to the copier output without an additional inverter being required. Assume, as one example here, a five page five sheet simplex document set, from which 10 pre collated copy sets are desired. This is accomplished here with 12 document set circulations. A first non copying circulation of this document set determines with a count of the sheet sensor switch 29 in conjunction with bail switch 31 whether there are an odd or even number of documents. Determining that the number of document pages is odd in this example, i.e., that the last document N is 5, the copier controller 100 in the next second circulation of the document set skips the first and subsequent alternate documents and copies only the even pages 4 and 2, in that order i.e., copies only pages N minus 1 and N minus 3 and places those even page copy sheets in the duplex buffer tray 116. The other document sheets are circulated in this first copying circulation, but their copying is inhibited and no corresponding copy sheet is fed for them in this first copying circulation. On the next 9 document circulations in this 10 set example intermediate circulations 3 to 11 all the documents are copied in the N to 1 order, i.e., 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. However, the copy sheets for page 5 is fed from the copy sheet tray 107 or 106 not the duplex buffer tray 116 and after receiving page 5 on only one side thereof is directly outputted, as a simplex copy. Page 5 is thus face up in the output to the finisher 140, and the first copy sheet out. Document page 4 is then copied on a sheet fed from the copy tray 107 or 106 and fed into the duplex buffer tray 116. The next copy sheet is fed from the bottom of the duplex tray 116. This is the copy sheet on which page 4 had been printed in the previous circulation.Document page 3 is printed on its opposite face, and, due to the inherent inversion in the processor output path, this second copy sheet out is placed in the output path with its page 3 side face up and its page 4 side face down on top of the preceeding page 5 copy sheet.The next even document page, page 2, is also copied on a clean copy sheet from tray 106 or 107 and fed into the duplex tray 116 on top of the preceeding page 4.The last copy sheet in each set is fed from the duplex tray 116 and it receives the document page 1 image on the opposite side of the previous page 2 image and is likewise outputted. Thus, in each of these 9 document circulations a complete duplexed outputted copy set is provided stacked in the finisher 140 in the proper collated order 1 2 3 4 5 blank and meanwhile the duplex tray 116 has been refilled with another evenside buffer set. On the last 12th document set circulation in this example the above copying sequence is changed in that none of the even document pages, 2 and 4 in this example, are copied. Thus, the duplex buffer tray 116 is emptied out, and not refilled, on the last copying circulation, and the final lOth copy set is provided, as taught by the above cited Adamak patent. If, in the above example, there had been an even number of documents, e.g. 4, the copier controller would change the copying sequence and not skip the first and subsequent alternate documents being recirculated in the first copying circulation. Rather, it would skip pages 3 and 1, the second and alternate documents, to copy only the even pages 2 and 4 in the first circulation. On the second copying circulation it would feed the first copy sheet page 4 to the duplex tray, not to the output, since it is an even page to be duplexed, as described above. If, in the above example, there had been only one copy set requested punched into the copy count selector switch rather than 10, then only the first and second and last document circulations described above would be utilized. There would be no intermediate circulations in which all documents were copied. It may be seen that by the combination here of reverse document page order copying but with automatic feeding of only even page copies into the duplex tray, and the feeding of those even page copies back to the processor in the order in which they were copied on their first sides, that proper output collation is maintained even though the last odd document page copy is effectively simplexed. To express it another way, with this system, no separate or additional inverter is required for effectively simplexing the last duplex copy sheet when there is an odd number of document pages. Further, this same document handler and copier can be alternatively utilized to produce fully simplexed copy sets from the same simplex documents if desired, and these simplex copy sheets will also be in the proper collated output order, i.e., output stacked in N to 1 order, but face up, so as to form proper 1 to N page order copy sets. It is important to note that with this system, that the odd image page number which is placed on the second side of the copy sheet being duplexed is the preceeding lower page number, not the succeeding higher page number. That is, page 3 is printed on the backside of page 4 and not page 5. This is essential for maintaining proper collation here, where the copy sheet is outputted with the last printed side up.This would be true of a straight through paper path bottom transfer copier as well as the disclosed top transfer copier with one inversion in the output path from the transfer station to the finisher. The present system automatically accomplishes, with this particular reverse serial order copying system, the placement of the next lower odd page number on the back of each copy sheet bearing the immediately previous higher even page number. It is also important to note that the present system properly and consistently handles letterhead or other pre printed or pre punched copy sheet stock or forms for duplex copying for either an odd or even number of duplex, or an even number of simplexJoriginals. In printing onto letterhead paper, page one, the odd page, must be printed on the front or letterhead side, not the back sides, of the copy sheet. For pre punched sheets the binder holes must be on the left side of the odd pages. With the present system these restricted copy sheets can desirably always be placed face up in either of the copy sheet trays, yet will always be properly duplexed, since the proper even page sides are always printed on the back of the copy sheets first as they are fed from the copy trays, and then the odd document pages are copied onto the front sides of the copy sheets as they are fed from the duplex tray. Briefly re describing the disclosed simplex duplex copying system, it will be seen that it does not require a separate or variable copy output sheet inverter yet provides proper page order collated output of all copies, even for those copiers like the Xerox 4000 or 5400 which have an inherent inversion in the paper path output after transfer rather than a straight through paper path . Such a paper path is disclosed here. There is no feeding of a blank side copy sheet through the processor for the back of a last odd copy page, or its inversion. The documents are always circulated in N to 1 order i.e., reverse serial page order in all circulations. For this purpose, the simplex document set here is placed face up in the tray of a document handler which bottom feeds the documents to the platen. Before copying is initiated, the document set is first initially circulated in one non copying circulation during which the number of documents is counted. If an even number of simplex documents is counted on this first pre count circulation, then on the second and first copying circulation the documents are copied in the order N, N minus 2, N minus 4, N minus 6, etc.. That is, when the pre count circulation determines that the last document is an even document, then all even documents only are copied in the second document circulation by copying every other document in reverse order starting with the very last document N. The odd document pages are circulated, but not copied. In contrast, if an odd number of documents is counted in the pre count cycle, then the last sheet N of the document set and the alternate subsequent documents are not copied on the second circulation and the copyin stream. Thus, the duplex documents are also first run through a single dummy non copying circulation, but with inversion to restack the documents inverted in the DH tray from their initial orientation. Thus, the even sides of the duplex documents are copied on the second first copying circulation and placed in the duplex tray so that the proper page order sequence can be provided in the output of the duplex copy sheets without an inverter. On all subsequent circulations up to the final one every duplex document sheet is copied on one side and then inverted before restacking as described in the above cited U. S. applicationsSerial Nos. 825,743 and 825,751 but in reverse serial order . That is, all the odd sides are copied on the third second copying circulation onto the opposite sides of the buffer set fed from the duplex tray, then all the even sides are copied in the fourth circulation and placed in the duplex tray, etc., etc.. The duplex documents are inverted during all but the last circulation. On the last duplex document copying pass the documents are all copied but are not inverted. Therefore, they are automatically re collated in the document handler tray during this last copying circulation. To improve copy efficiency, an additional feature may be provided if there are only two simplex documents in the document set. With only two simplex documents, there is only one copy sheet in each duplex copy set, so collation is not required. If only two document sheets are counted in the document set during the non copying first circulation, the copying control 100 causes the copier 10 to make multiple rather than single copies of these first and second document sheets in the first copying circulation. That is, the copier automatically switches to a nonprecollation duplex copying mode in which the selected number of copies, but limited to the duplex tray 116 capacity is made from each document while it is held on the platen without circulation, and all these copy sheets are stored into the duplex tray and then the next document is multiply copied onto their opposite sides. If the number of copy counter selected copies exceeds the duplex tray capacity, the two documents are re circulated for copying, e.g., for 60 duplex copies of two documents with a 25 sheet capacity duplex tray, 25 copies are made in the first circulation, 25 in the second and ten in the third.
