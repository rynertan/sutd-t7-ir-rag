## Description
HIGH SPEED IGFET SENSE AMPLIFIER LATCH BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates generally to semiconductor memory circuits which require sensinq against a fixed reference voltaqe and, more particularly, to an improved insulated qate fild effect transistor IGFET sense amplifier suitable for use in conjunction with a read only memory ROM .2. Description of the Prior Art U.S. Patent No. 4,123,799 entitled A High Speed IGFETSense Amplifier Latch describes a latching type sense amplifier to be used in conjunction with a static IGFET random access memory RAM . A pair of depletion mode devices serve as load devices for the latch and as means for couplinq a pair of bit lines to the sense amplifier.Prior to sensinq, the bit lines and the switching nodes of the latch are precharaed and balanced. The selection of a memory cell induces a small differential voltage across the bit lines, causing one of the load devices to be more conductive than the other.When the latch is enabled, regenerative amplification causes the latch to seek one of two stable states as determined by the relative conductivities of the two load devices thereby latching the state of the data stored in the selected memory cell. The selection of a ROM memory cell does not result in the production of a differential voltage. It merely provides a discharqe path for a data voltage node. It was first believed that the sense amplifier of the above cited patent could still be utilized by couplinq one of the input load devices to the data voltaqe node and by couplina the other indus load device to a reference voltaqe. However, this resulted in an inability to control the voltaqe at the switching nodes of the latch. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a sense amplifier for an IGFET read only memory which is highly sensitive to the difference between the bit line voltage and a reference voltage. It is a further object of the invention to provide a sense amplifier for an IGFET read only memory which can amplify and latch the state of a selected memory cell very shortly after selection of the cell. It is yet another object of the invention to provide a sense amplifier for an IGFET read only memory which uses depletion mode field effect transistors to isolate the switching nodes of the latch from the bit line and the reference voltaqe. Finally, it is an object of the invention to provide a monolithically integrable sense amplifier which permits data stored in a read only memory to be sensed at a hiqh rate of speed over a wide range of ambient temperature conditions. According to a broad aspect of the invention there is provided a sense amplifier coupled to a source of supply voltage for receiving a reference voltage and a voltage data signal from a memory cell, comprising a cross coupled latching circuit containing first and second switching nodes first means for prechargina and clamping said switching nodes at a firs t voltage having a maximum which is a predetermined fraction of said supply voltaqe and first and second switching devices coupled to said latching circuit for couplinq said data sianal and said reference voltaqe to said latchinq circuit and for providinq differential load impedances for forcinq said latching circuit into one of two states. The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be better understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanyinq drawings, in which BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a sense amplifier according to the present invention and Figure 2 is a timing diagram which demonstrates the operation of the sense amplifier shown in Figure 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referrinq to FIGURE 1, there is shown a memory circuit which includes a read only memory 2, a bit line represented by conductor 4, a reference voltage generator 6, pre charge circuitry 8 and a sense amplifier 10 having a first input coupled to the data bit line 4 and havinq a second input coupled to the reference voltage VR . The memory 2 may be comprised of a plurality of columns e.g. 12, 14, 16 and a plurality of rows e.g. 18, 20, 22 . The intersections of each of the columns and rows may or may not be occupied by a transistor such as is shown at 24 depending on whether particular location in memory 2 is to represent a binary ONE or ZERO i.e. the presence of a transistor represents a ONE at that location in memory. A particular location is accessed by selectively energizing a particular row and column as is well known in the art.InFIGURE 1, a particular column is energized by applying a column select signal to the gate electrode of a particular column select transistor, for example 26, the current conducting path of which is in series with column select line 12. The drain electrode of each of the column select transistors is coupled to bit line 4. The pre charge circuitry 8 is coupled between VDD and the bit line 4 at node 30, and comprises first and second series connected field effect transistors 32 and 34 respectively. The gate electrode of transistor 32 is coupled to its drain electrode, and the gate electrode of transistor 34 is coupled to a source of clock signals CL.The junction of the source of transistor 32 and the drain of transistor 34 is denoted by node 36. The reference voltage VR is generated at the junction of two resistors 40 and 42, preferably polysilicon, coupled in series between VDD and ground. If resistors 40 and 42 are equal, a reference voltaqe of VDD 2 approximately 2.5 volts will be generated. Bit line 4 is coupled to the gate electrode of depletion mode IGFET device 44, and the reference voltageVR is connected to the gate electrode of depletion modeIGFET device 46. Depletion mode devices 44 and 46 couple bit line 4 and VR to switching nodes 48 and 50 of sense amplifier 10. Node 48 is coupled to the drain of device 52 and also to the gate of device 54. Similarly, node 50 is coupled to the drain of device 54 and to the gate of device 52. The source of device 52 is common to the source of device 54 at node 56. Device 58, coupled between node 56 and ground, is used to enable sense amplifier 10, and is controlled by a delayed inverted clock voltage CLDLYD applied to terminal 60. Also coupled to nodes 48 and 50 of sense amplifier 10 are devices 62 64 and 66. The gate electrodes of devices 62, 64 and 66 are all connected to node 68, the voltage of which is controlled by the clock voltage CL approximately 5 volts . The drain terminals of devices 44, 46, 62, and 64 are all connected to node 36 by means of conductor 70. Nodes 48 and 50 serve as the true and complement outputs of sense amplifier circuit 10, and supply the data sensed from the memory cell to circuitrv external from the memory circuit. The operation of the preferred embodiment will now be described with the aid of the timing diagram shown inFIGURE 2. Prior to selection of a memory cell, the clock signal CL becomes hiqh 5 volts as is shown in FIGURE 2a thus activating precharge circuitry 8. That is, the clock signal CL turns on transistor 34 during this precharge phase. Because transistor 32 is coupled with its gate tied to its drain, the voltage at node 36 becomes fixed at VDD V THRESHOLD or approximately 3.5 volts. The voltaqe at node 30 increases until it reaches some predetermined voltage which is a few millivolts greater than the reference voltage VR. This situation is shown in that portion of FIGURE 2c corresponding to the precharqe period. When CL is at a high level 5 volts devices 62, 64 and 66 are also rendered conductive. This has the effect of clamping the voltaae at nodes 48 and 50 to the voltage at node 36 3.5 volts . This is shown in FIGURE 2d where the solid curve represents the voltage at node 48 and the dotted curve represents the voltage at node 50. Thus, no matter how hard depletion sense devices 4 or 46 are driven during precharge, neither nodes 48 nor 50 can deviate from the voltage at node 36 assuming CL is a full level swing clock. This voltage clamping is critical to the operation since the sense amplifier inputs are not normally equalized, the first being coupled to VR and the second beinq susceptible to clock coupling transients.The arranqeinent shown in FIGURE 1 eliminates consideration of voltage differences or voltage equalization prior to the clock CLDLYD going high. Since the inverted complement of the clock signal CLDLyD r supplied to the gate of device 58 via terminal 60, is low device 5 is non conductive and no current is supplied to the source terminals of devices 52 and 54. During the precharqing of sense amplifier circuit 10, depletion mode devices 44 and 46 are conducting. However, devices 62 and 64 are much larqer than load devices 44 and 46. Thus, from a transient point of view, precharge devices 62 and 64 dominate over devices 44 and 46 in setting the voltages on nodes 48 and 50 when enabled by clock voltage CL. Immediately prior to enabling the sense amplifier, the voltages at the source terminals of devices 44 and 46 are equal because device 66 is shorting node 48 to node 50. When CL goes low at time tl FIGURE 2a , transistors 62, 64 and 66 turn off disconnecting nodes 48 and 50. This permits node 48 to be controlled by the impedance of device 44 which is dependent upon the voltage at node 30. Similarly, node 50 is controlled by the impedance of transistor 46 which is dependent upon the reference voltage VR. When the clock CL qoes low, memory 2 may be accessed.If the accessed location is programmed i.e. contains a transistor such as at 24 the voltage at node 30 will begin to discharge. The CLDLYD signal is delayed sufficiently to allow the voltage at node 30 to fall belowVR by approximately 100 millivolts. This may take typically between 20 and 100 nanoseconds depending on circuit characteristics. As is shown in FIGURES 2b and 2c, when a small differential voltage has been created between bit line 4 and VR, the sense amplifier 10 is enabled by taking CLDLyD high at time t2. At this time, devices 62, 64 and 66 are all turned off. Device 58, having a source coupled to ground and a drain coupled to node 56, turns on and allows current to flow through devices 52 and 54. Once enabled, devices 52 and 54 begin to pull current through load devices 44 and 46. Load device 44 has a hiqher impedance than load device 46 and a larqer voltage will be developed across the drain and source terminals of device 44 than that developed across device 46 since the gate voltage of device 44 is slightly lower than that of device 46. The voltage at node 48 becomes lower than the voltage at node 50.As the voltage at node 48 moves toward ground, device 54 will conduct less and less current until the regenerative action of the circuit results in device 54 being made totally nonconducting while device 52 continues to conduct. The voltage on node 36 will be pulled to ground potential by the low impedance path through devices 52 and 58 while the voltage at node 50 will be pulled up to the voltaae at node 36 3.2 volts . Because the logical state of the memory cell has now been latched in the sense amplifier, the column and row select voltages can now be removed without affecting the voltages on nodes 48 and 50. To prepare for the next sense cycle, the clock voltage CL shown in FIGURE 2a is again taken to a high level and the process repeated. Using a similar analysis, if the addressed location was not programmed, then the voltage at node 30 would remain higher than the reference voltage. In this case, when the sense amplifier is enabled, node 50 would go to ground and node 48 would be pulled up to 3.5 volts the voltage at node 36 . Inverters 72 and 74 are coupled to nodes 48 and 50 for supplying the DATA OUT and DATA OUT siqnals and for restoring the 3.5 volt signals to VDD. For the sake of completeness, the following represents suitable dimensions for the MOS devices shown in FIGURE 1.
