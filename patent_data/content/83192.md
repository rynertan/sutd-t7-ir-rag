# Fuel cell stack.

## Abstract
A fuel cell stack has a plurality of stacked unit cells, each consisting of a pair of gas diffusion electrodes with a matrix containing an electrolyte solution interposed between them, with an interconnector 21 having a fuel gas passage 25 on one surface and an oxidizing gas agent passage 24 on the other surface interposed between each pair of adjacent unit cells. One out of every three to five interconnectors 21 is a one piece molded product which has at least one cooling pipe 23 embedded in it and which provides an excellent cooling effect. The fuel cell stack stably provides a high output voltage over a long period of operation time.
