# MACHINE TOOL INCLUDING A TOOL TRANSFER MECHANISM

## Abstract
A tool 19 selected from a tool storage matrix 16 is held at an exchange position Ex in readiness for exchange with a tool mounted on a work head 10 which is movable along a main beam 13 in a Y machining direction. A carriage 71 is movable along a subsidiary beam 70 in a direction parallel to the Y ma chining direction and carries a pair of tool grippers 77. During a tool change, one of the grippers 77 takes the tool from the ex change position Ex and holds the latter while the carriage 71 moves to the work head 10 where it latches onto the latter by means of a latch device 79 Fig. 9 . The other gripper 77 then removes the tool from the work head 10, whereupon said one gripper inserts the replacement tool in the work head. The car riage 71 then unlatches from the work head 10 and moves away therefrom, so that said other gripper 77 can return the re moved tool to the exchange position Ex. In order that tools can also be exchanged in a right angle head 15 when the latter is attached to the work head 10, the grippers 77 are each capable of an angular wrist action movement.
