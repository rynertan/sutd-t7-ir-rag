## Description
DescriptionConcealed Aerator Which Seals Against A Spout When Inserted ThereinTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to aerators insertable into a female threaded spout.Background ArtIn the past, aerators that are insertable into the end of a spout through which liquidMpressure flows have been designed in various ways to be concealed within the spout.The present inventor has, in fact, taught numerous concealed aerators in certain of his foreign and United States patents.In United Kingdom Patent 1 189 550, Figures 4 through 7 illustrate concealed aerators. In each depicted embodiment in the UK patent, the aerator is threaded at its upstream end and does not show a spout which is female threaded at the most downstream portion. A large portion of commercial aerators are not concealed and are coupled to the female threading of a spout at the most downstream portion thereof. Accordingly, the aerators shown in UK patent 1 189 550 have not been substitutable with a number of commercial aerators of the unconcealed variety.In addition, the outer diameters of the aerators of the prior British patent were not specified as having standard male threads, corresponding to those of common conventional unconcealed aerators, thus further underscoring the lack of substitutability of the concealed aerators and known unconcealed aerators. Further, the British patent does not teach the extending of the aerator upstream from the threading and, hence, does not teach an upstream portion of smaller diameter than the threaded downstream portion of the aerator. Thus, although useful and valuable in its intended illustrated embodiments the invention pictured in UK patent 1,189,550 lacked substitutability in various instances.In U.S. Patent 3,067,951 an at least partly concealedAghnides aerator is disclosed. As in the British patent, this U.S. Patent does not teach an unthreaded upstream extension. The entire length of the concealed portion of this prior aerator is threaded and coupled to the length of female threading in the spout. Like UK Patent 1,189,550, this patented embodiment does not house any portion of the aerator above the threaded portion of the aerator and is, to that extent, limited in application.U.S. Patent 3,298,614, also to Aghnides, shows a concealed aerator in Figure 5 which does extend upward into the spout beyond the threading. However, this embodiment relies on only the threading to achieve sealing and does not show the aerator of Figure 5 inserted into a spout having a smaller inner diameter upstream from the threaded spout end.It is noted that the UK Patent 1,189,550 teaches an annular shoulder 28 of transverse wall 13 which abuts the spout 25 . In Aghnides 951 a perforated disc 61 abuts the spout 60 . However, in both instances the internal structure of the aerator contacts the spout. Pressure is thus applied to the transverse wall or disc upon insertion of the aerator.Finally, U.S. Patent 3,014,667 to McLean et al illustrates in Figure 9 a flow control device in an aerator. TheMcLean device does not teach an aerator insertable into a spout threaded at its most downstream end. The McLean et al device also clusters the aerator 82 downstream from the threads, while a flow control element 84 is coupled to the aerator and placed upstream of the threads. McLean et al do not disclose how to extend an aerator upward into a smaller diameter portion of a spout in order to achieve concealment thereof, or to increase flow length in the aerator, when the aerator is coupled to threads at the most downstream portion of the spout. Accordingly, substitutability with standard threaded, unconcealed aerators is not sought.That is, as with other prior concealable aerators, the McLean et al device does not indicate that its male threading conforms to the standard threading of unconcealed aerators.In reviewing the above references, it is thus noted that the prior patents a do not feature aerator substitutability in size and b do not provide sealing by an element carried on an annular ledge formed by the interfacing of the upstream portion and threaded downstream portion of an aerator the downstream portion having a larger outer diameter.It is also noted that the prior references do not provide the structure or dimensions of elements for a concealed aerator which would yield the same flow characteristics of a conventional unconcealed aerator. This is, of course, significant where various governments have provided regulations controlling flow characteristics. McLean et al employ a separate flow control element, but do not discuss how to define substitutable flow characteristics with the aerator alone. None of the references specify the relative dimensions of the spout and aerator required for such substitutable flow and none provide for a jet forming element with longitudinal channels therethrough where the channels discreetly increase in cross section down stream in order to achieve conventional flow characteristics. Further, the references which do not extend the aerator length also do not allow for a screen in the aerator to be displaced longitudinally upward and downward when a coin used for screwing and unscrewing the aerator is inserted into the lower end of the aerator.In examining various prior aerators, one will note that sealing the aerator when inserted in a spout is a significant feature. Typically, an aerator includes one tubular member which abuts the end of the spout or a shelf along the interior of the spout at a location where the spout reduces in diameter in the upstream direction. In some instances, an inner tubular member is encircled by an outer tubular member with an air gap therebetween however, as shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,270,965, only the inner tubular member seals against the spout. Although satisfactory in some applications, it has been found that such sealing may not be adequate with some aerator designs which embody inner tubular members encircled by outer tubular members, especially in a concealed or partly concealed embodiment.To prevent water leaking downstream into an air channel between the two concentric tubular members and to prevent air leaking upstream, the forming of a tight seal is a distinct benefit in an aerator.Disclosure of InventionThe present invention is directed to a partially or fully concealed aerator which is screwably coupable to female threading at the most downstream portion of a spout.Through the spout fluid to be aerated flows under pressure. According to the invention, the female threading is a standard threading which corresponds to conventional, unconcealed aerators. Upstream from the female threading of the spout is an upstream pipe portion of smaller inner diameter than the female threaded downstream pipe portion of the spout. The present aerator is dimensioned to fit in such a spout, the aerator having standard male threading and having a reduced diameter upstream therefrom. It is thus an object of the invention to provide a concealed aerator which fits into a spout which can also accommodate a standard, unconcealed aerator.In addition, it is an object of the invention to enhance sealing of the substitutable concealed aerator against the spout by defining an annular ledge interfacing between threaded the upstream unthreaded portion and downstream portion of the aerator and including an annular sealing element on the ledge. Inasmuch as in the United States and abroad the threading of most existing and new faucets is at present standard female threads having an inner diameter of 23.00 mm. 13 16 27 TPI , an object of the invention is the creation of an aerator having male threads which will fit said standard female threads and which is partially or entirely concealable, to permit easy replacement of old aerators and to avoid any changes with regard to said female threads and to the dimensions upstream said threads in the manufacture of new faucet spouts. In aerators entirely concealed, it is also an object of the invention to provide effective means for screwing the aerator to and from the spout. Indents are provided at the bottom of the aerator into which a coin is insertable.When inserted, the coin enters a longitudinal cavity within the aerator. A screen contained in a shell is either a pushed upward in the cavity by the coin during insertion thereof, the screen returning to a lower position when the coin is removed, or b fixedly coupled far enough upstream in the cavity so that the coin is insertable without contacting the shell containing the screen. In the first instance, means are provided for limiting the downstream travel of the shell. In one embodiment, the invention is a totally concealed aerator. In another embodiment, a partially concealed aerator is provided. In this invention, partially concealed means that the aerator includes a a male threaded portion which is screwable into female threading at the most downstream pipe portion of a spout, b an unthreaded portion upstream from the male threaded portion, and c an unthreaded portion downstream from the male threaded portion, wherein only the unthreaded downstream portion is not concealed. To further facilitate fabrication, assembly, and installation and to decrease cost, the aerator is formed of molded plastic various portions of the aerator being combined into an integral structure. Also, in a specific embodiment, the plastic may be transparent with metal interspersed therein if desired. Further, in a specific embodiment of a partially concealed aerator, the unthreaded downstream portion is contained within a metal sleeve or housing which, to cover a conventional aerator, would have to be twice as big and cost correspondingly more. Also in the partially concealed aerator form of the invention, it is preferred that the inner diameter of the portion of the aerator downstream from the threading exceed the inner diameter of the portion upstream from the threading. This achieves the object of enhanced flow characteristics. Still further, one embodiment ofthe invention includes an inner tubular member with windows therein and an outer tubular member with air channels therein, the concentric members being spaced apart and coupled by arcuate members positioned in the space therebetween at angular intervals. Between adjacent arcuate members is air space which connects the air channels to the windows to provide an air passageway from outside the aerator into a chamber circumscribed by the inner tubular member. The inner tubular member has an upstream surface and the outer tubular member has an upstream surface. To close off the air space between the two concentric members, a washer lies on the upstream surface of the inner tubular member and on the upstream surface of the outer tubular member1 the washer covering the air space between the two members.When the aerator is screwed into the spout, the washer is pressed between a shelf within the spout and the respective upstream surfaces of the inner tubular member and the outer tubular member. Further, in this embodiment, a disc with apertures therein is disposed upstream of the inner tubular poriton, the disc being dimensioned to fit within an upstream pipe portion of the spout that has a reduced diameter relative to the downstream end of the spout which is female threaded. The inner tubular portion has a larger diameter than the disc and is preferably larger than the reduced diameter of the upstream pipe portion of the spout.To further enhance sealing, the washer is dimensioned so that its inner peripheral surface seats against the outer peripheral surface of the disc when the washer is pressed between a the annular shelf of the spout i.e. where the spout diameter changes and b the two upstream surfaces. Accordingly, a tight seal for an aerator that is at least partly concealed with at least part of the disc positioned upstream of the female threading in the upstream pipe portion of the spout and includes concentric inner and outer tubular members is provided.Brief description of the drawingsFigure 1 is an illustration of a prior art unconcealed aerator which is inserted in a spout of a given diameter.Figure 2 is an illustration of a fully concealed aerator which is insertable into a spout having standard female threading at its most downstream portion.Figure 3 is a partial bottom view of the aerator illustrated in figure 2.Figure 4 is a front cutaway view of a partly concealed aerator including two concentric, spaced apart tubular members, the left half of the view being taken along line AB of figure 6 and the right half of the view being taken along line BC.Figure 5 is a front cutaway view of an embodiment of an aerator according to the invention.Figure 6 is a partial top view and Figure 7 is a section view along line 10 10 of figure 5.Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention Referring to Figure 1, a spout 100 is shown having an upstream portion 102 and a female threaded downstream pipe portion 104 . The female threaded portion 104 has a standard female threading of approximately 23.5mm. Shown inserted into the most downstream portion of 104 is a conventional, unconcealed aerator 106 having a standard male threading 108 which is complementary with the female threading at the spout end. That is, the male threading 108 has an outer diameter of approximately 23.5mm. Examining the upstream pipe portion 102 of the spout 100 , it is noted that the inner diameter thereof is significantly less than the inner diameter of the female threading provided along the inner surface of the downstream pipe portion 104 .In this regard it is noted that an annular surface 110 , which is transverse to the longitudinal axis A of the spout 100 , is defined along the inner contour of the spout 100 . To provide sealing of the conventional, unconcealed aerator 106 , an annular washer 112 is provided. Hence, the annular washer 112 provides one measure of sealing and the threading provides a second measure of sealing Referring to Figure 2, a partially concealed aerator 400 is illustrated in which the upstream pipe portion 402 of spout 403 is not maximized. That is, the spout 403 has the same dimension as that shown in Figure 1, which is conventionally provided. A A tubular element 410 in the Figure 2 embodiment includes a first length 412 , a second length 416 and a third length 418 , the first length 412 having standard male threading and being interposed between the unthreaded second tubular length 416 which is upstream therefrom and the unthreaded third tubular length 418 which is downstream therefrom. The third tubular length 418 , if desired, can be encased or housed in a metal sleeve 420 .Along the inner wall 422 of the tubular length 410 are a plurality of longitudinal ribs 424 . Contained within the ribs are longitudinally extending curtains 426 having longitudinal slits 427 therebetween. The curtains 426 encircle the screen 406 , air entering the slits 427 between the curtains 426 to provide aeration of the liquid passing through the screen 406 . The screen 406 is held in place by prongs 428 which project inwardly from the ribs 424 at the downstream end thereof. The slits 427 are large enough to permit air to flow in but not sufficiently large that water flows out therefrom. As an alternative to the prongs 428 the screen 406 may be coupled in place by ultrasonic treatment or other means. As an alternative, the wall 418 of Figure 2 may be eliminated and the sleeve 420 may directly encircle the ribs 424.The downstreammost end of the sleeve 420 is then turned inwardly sufficiently to form a desired tubular outlet orifice which guides the bubbly stream discharging from the aerator 400.By increasing the spacing between ribs 424, a larger inflow of air can be made to enter the aerator 400 between the ribs 424. In examining Figure 2 further, it may be noted that bridge elements 500 therein differ from the bridge elements inFigure 4 in that elements 500 permit water to flow in only one side of each bridge element 500. The type of bridge element may be interchanged as desired. Figure 3, a bottom view of Figure 2, shows the spout 403 , the metal encasing 420 of the third tubular length 418 , a plurality of the longitudinal ribs 424 as well as the curtains 426 , and the prongs 428 . Examining the jet forming means 404 , it is noted that a plurality of bridge elements 500 are provided. Bridge elements 500 are also provided in the Figure 2 andFigure 4 embodiments . The bridge elements 500 may have various configurations as suggested by the embodiments disclosed above. As previously indicated the dimensions of the invention in the various embodiments are significant. In theFigure 2 embodiment, in particular, the aerator 208 has the following preferable dimensions. The inner wall 246 preferably has an inner diameter of 19mm, while the inner diameter of the longitudinal ribs 24 are 17.25mm. The outer diameter of the shell 234 is preferably 17mm, the thickness of the shell 234 being .2mm. The jet forming means 230 has three rows of channels 472 at center to center distances of 4mm, 9nix, and 14mm including 14 channels 472 in the outer row and 5 channels in the inner row.Entrance openings 470 to each channel 472 has a cross section of .5mm x .5mm whereas the cross section of each channel 472 is a constant lmm x lmm having, as previously noted, a length of 3.5mm. The screen 236 has 40 wires per inch, each wire having a diameter of .01 inches. Preferably the screen 236 includes 2 layers separated from each other by lmm. With the above indicated dimensions, the totally concealed aerator 208 of Figure 2 provides a rate of flow of 2.6 gallons per minute at 80 pounds back pressure, which conforms with the water saving regulations of various states in the United States. Similarly, the embodiments shown in Figures4 and 5 also conform to the appropriate state regulations standards when properly dimensioned. In the aerator of Figure 4 for instance, the jet forming disc 504 may have two rows of chambers aligned at center to center distances of 12.0 mm and 6.0 mm.In such a disc 504 , a total of 16 chambers were provided, each of which had a cross section of 1.0 x 1.0 mm. These chambers were each 2.0 mm high and were topped each by a bridge open on both sides, each entrance opening so formed being 0.6 x 0.6 mm. Thus, an aerator of this invention, whether partially or entirely concealed, may embody such a disc have a second tubular length of a diameter of 16.00 mm or less and fit new as well as existing spouts. Referring now to Figure 4, a nearly entirely concealed aerator 502 is depicted. At the upstream end of the aerator 502 is a disc 504 having bridge elements 500 which open into apertures 506. Extending downstreamward from the disc 504 is an inner tubular member 510. Specifically, member 510 includes an annular rim 512 which flares radially outwardly from the downstreammost portion 514 of the disc 504 and a plurality of ribs 516 which are angularly spaced about the axis 0.The ribs 516 circumscribe a chamber 518 into which water enters from the disc 504. The spaces between ribs 516 represent windows to the chamber 518. Encircling the rim 512 and spaced radially outwardly therefrom is an outer tubular member 520. The outer tubular member 520 includes a male threaded ring 522 and a plurality of webs 524 protruding inwardly from the inner peripheral surface of the ring 522 at angularly spaced intervals. Preferably, the ring 522 has an inwardly bent flange portion 526 at its most upstream end. The male threaded ring 522 is shown to be complementary with the standard female threading of spout 530 at a downstream pipe portion 532 thereof. An upstream pipe portion 534 has a relatively reduced diameter, the upstream pipe portion 534 and downstream pipe portion 532 meeting at an annular shelf 538. Preferably, the shelf 538 lies in a plane orthogonal to the axis 0. Examination of the space between the inner tubular member 510 and the outer tubular member 520 shows that the two members are coupled together by arcuate members 540 which have corresponding arcuate air spaces 542 therebetween. See also arcuate members 630,632 and 642 of the Figure fi embodiment with air spaces c d a b therebetween . The arcuate members 540 and air spaces 542 extend downstream from the space between the rim 512 and flange 526 to an annular retaining element 546 for screens 548. The screens 548 are preferably 50 x 50 wires where each wire has a diameter of .009 . The retaining element 546 is held between ribs 516 and webs 524, To insert the aerator 502, a stem 550 is provided which can receive a coin 552. As the coin 552 advances from position 552 to 552 , the aerator 502 screws into the spout 530.As this occurs, the upstream surface 560 of the flange 526 and the upstream surface 562 of the rim 512 press against a washer 564 which is sandwiched between said surfaces 560, 562 and the annular shelf 538. Preferably, the washer 564 is a flat rubber washer as described in previous embodiments and the upstream surfaces 560 and 562 preferably lie along a common plane which is orthogonal to the axis of the aerator 502 shown as 0 . In Figure 7, the washer 564 seats against the outer peripheral surface of the disc 504 when the washer 564 is pressed against the shelf 538. This is preferable in that not only do the two upstream surfaces 560 and 562 make a seal but the disc 504 also forms a seal peripherally. At this point, it may be noted that the washer 564 may be omitted if desired, thereby providing a direct dual seal of the upstream surfaces 560 and 562 against the shelf 538.In this variation it must be realized that the outer diameter of the rim 512 must exceed the diameter of the upstream pipe portion 534 so that the dual seal can be effected. This limitation is of course not a requirement where the washer 564 is provided. A review of the aerator 502 of Figure 4 shows that the openings 506 of the disc 504 are entirely upstream of the female threaded portion 532 of. the spout 530. The aerator 600 of Figure 8 is similar to the Figure 4 embodiment, except that the openings 602 are in three, rather than two concentric rows of preferably 50 chambers, each chamber having a .6 mm x .6 mm cross section and a height of 2 mm each opening 602 has a bridge element 604 which directs water into the disc 606 from only one side having preferable opening dimensions of .6 mm width by .7 mm height the openings 602 extend axially down to the rim 605 from the upstream pipe portion 607 to the downstream pipe portion 608 of the spout 610 and, rather than insertion by means of a coin, an axially extended outer tubular member 612 with knurled ends 614 is provided for screwing in the aerator 600. The screens in Figure 8 are preferably 40 x 40 wires of .009 diameter because of the third screen. In this embodiment also, the outer row of openings has preferably 22 chambers, the middle 17, and the inner 11 at center to center distances of 14.5, 11, and 7 mm respectively. The embodiment of Figure 5 is also depicted in Figures 6 and 7, Figure 6 representing a partial top view and Figure 7 representing a section view along line 10 10. In Figure 6, three concentric rows of openings 602 are shown, together with arcuate spaces abcd positioned at angularly spaced intervals, 900 in Figure 6. The upper end of webs 630 and 632 are shown in Figure 5. When inserted into the spout 610, the upstream surface 634 of the flange 636 of the aerator 600 presses against a washer 638 the air spaces abcd between arcuate web members 630 and 642 and between arcuate web members 642 and 632 being sealed by the washer 638. Turning now to Figure 7, air is shown entering between web members, e.g. 630 and 642. Furthermore, ribs 650 through 656 are shown disposed radially inward from the web members 630, 642, 632, and 658 respectively. The ribs 650 through 656 hold the screen 660 in position.
