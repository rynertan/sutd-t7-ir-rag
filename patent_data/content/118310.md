# PLANT AND METHOD FOR TREATING SOLID WASTE MATERIAL

## Abstract
A system for handling and pyrolyzing municipal solid waste material the pyrolyzing being performed in coke ovens 20 of the type used in the steel industry. The municipal solid waste material is shredded 11 to produce a particle size of approximately four inches. The shredded waste material is conveyed to a splitter arrangement 13 wherein the flow of waste material is divided into selectable flows of 50 50 or 25 25 25 25. Each such flow is terminated at a respective bale making machine 15 where the waste material is formed into bales of predetermined dimensions and bulk density. The bales are then inspected for defects and defective bales are removed from the conveying system 17 . The remaining bales are conveyed to an accumulating dock area 19 where they are counted and accumulated, and loaded into magazines capable of holding a predetermined number of bales constituting a complete oven charge. A ram device drives the bales from the magazine into the coke ovens. Mechanism is provided for automatically opening the door of the coke oven prior to loading the charge therein, applying a sealant thereto, and sealably closing the door after loading. The charge of baled municipal solid waste is pyrolyzed and a variety of useful products are generated which can be used to perpetuate the process or which can be stored and sold commercially.
