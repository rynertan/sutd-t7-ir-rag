The device includes an outer garment 14 which has a waist aperture 16 for fitting around the body of a small animal 12 , a pair of leg apertures 18 and 20 for fitting around the legs of the animal, and a tail aperture 22 . The waist aper ture 16 and the leg apertures 18 and 20 include a resilient material or band 28 and 30 for assuring that the apertures fit snugly around the animal s body and legs respectively. The tail aperture 22 is particularly located and of such a size that the anal opening of the animal is not covered. The outer garment 14 further includes a first portion 32 of an attaching means such as a snap or Velcro fastener at a first location which is adjacent the tail aperture 22 and in between the leg apertures 18 and 20 . Also included is another first portion 34 of an attaching means located adjacent the waist aperture 16 . A disposable pad 36 is fit within the outer garment 14 as an absorbent layer 38 and a liquid impervious layer 40 . A second portion 54 of an attaching means which cooperates with either of the first portions 32 or 34 on the garment 14 is used to hold the disposable pad in a first location. When placed in the first position, attaching edge 50 is adjacent the tail aperture 22 , and the free edge 52 is directed toward the waist aperture 16 . In this position, the garment and disposable pad is particularly suitable for collecting the urine and es trous discharge of a female animal. Alternately, the dispos able pad 36 may be located with the portion 54 of the attaching means connected to the first first portion 34 such that the free end 52 is directed towards the tail aperture 22 and the attaching edge is adjacent the waste aperture 16 . In this position, the outer garment and disposable pad are particularly suitable for collecting and absorbing the urine discharge of a male animal.
