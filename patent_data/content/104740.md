# Broad band surface acoustic wave edge deposited transducer.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method for fabricating and structure for a broad band surface acoustic wave SAW edge deposited transducer EDT 10 capable of frequencies in excess of 1 GHz and bandwidths in the hundreds of MHz. The method and apparatus allows fabrication of such a transducer on a semiconductor substrate 12 which is either non piezoelectric or weakly piezoelectric. The substrate is formed such as to have a sharp, smooth edge 20 formed by the intersection of its top 18 and a side surface 16 . A passivation layer 24 is deposited on the side surface of the substrate followed by a starter layer 34 to provide adhesion and nucleation sites. An inner metallic gold, for example electrode 26 is then deposited on the starter layer followed by a transducer layer 40 being deposited on the inner metallic electrode. An outer metallic electrode 36 is then deposited on the transducer layer a predetermined distance below the top surface of the substrate. When the transducer is excited, bulk longituolnal waves are generated in the transducer layer which couple to the longitudinal component of the surface wave in the substrate causing the SAW mode to propagate away from the transducer 10 .
