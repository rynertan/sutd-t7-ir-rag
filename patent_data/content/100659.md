## Description
TITLE PROCESS FOR MAKING RANEY NICKEL COATED CATHODE, AND PRODUCT THEREOF BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a process for making an improved low hydrogen overvoltage cathode of the Raney nickel type for use in chloralkali electrolysis, and to the cathode so made. Cathodes of the Raney nickel type are known.in the art, e.g., U.S. 4,116,804, U.S. 4,169,025 andU.S. 4,251,344. However, Raney nickel coated cathodes of the prior art, while initially exhibiting good performance characteristics, suffer certain defects. Such Raney nickel coating on the cathode substrate has been of low durability, i.e., easily mechanically damaged and lost even by, e.g., water jets. For example, when such a cathode is used in a diaphragm type chforalkali cell wherein an asbestos diaphragm is deposited directly onto the cathode surface, such diaphragm gradually loses its permeability due to clogging of the pores, usually after about 9 to 15 months, and must be removed and replaced removal is ordinarily accomplished by spraying with jets of water, and during such spraying, the jets of water have caused loss of some of the Raney nickel by flaking or spalling.When the replacement diaphragm is deposited and baked, ordinarily at 3550C in air for 4 hours, some deactivation of the Raney nickel coating by oxidation occurs. This progressive spalling and deactivation of Raney nickel after multiple washes and bakes is responsible for a progressive loss of the voltage benefit provided by the Raney nickel, i.e., the operating voltage of the cathode progressively increases and approaches the operating voltage of the cathode substrate. Accordingly, it is a principal object of this invention to provide an improved Raney nickel coated cathode having a more durable Raney nickel surface than those previously known, and a process for making same. Other objects will appear hereinafter. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Briefly, according to the present invention, there is provided a process for making a durable, low hydrogen overvoltage cathode for chloralkali use which comprises applying a nickel aluminum alloy composition containing 56 to 59 i by weight of nickel onto a suitable cathode substrate by plasma spraying, followed by leaching with caustic to remove aluminum. More specifically, there is provided in accordance with the invention a process for making a low hydrogen overvoltage cathode for a chloralkali cell which comprises a plasma spraying a coating of a nickel aluminum alloy composition containing 56 to 59 by wt. nickel onto a foraminous substrate of iron, ferrous alloy, nickel or nickel alloy, and b leaching aluminum from said coating by contacting the article prepared in step a with a caustic solution. There are also provided in accordance with the invention a Raney nickel coated cathode made by said process, a chloralkali cell containing said cathode, and a process for electrolysis of an alkali metal chloride in said cell. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the present invention a selected nickel aluminum alloy composition is applied to an electrically conductive cathode substrate by plasma spraying. It is a requirement of the present invention that the nickel aluminum alloy composition employed for deposition on the cathode substrate contain about 56 to 59 by wt. nickel. Nickel aluminum alloys in this composition range contain the intermetallic compound Ni Al as the predominant phase, but also contain minor amounts of NiAl and NiA13, the exact amounts of these varying with the specific overall composition. Preferably, the nickel aluminum alloy composition contains 56.5 to 57.5 by wt.nickel, most preferably substantially 57 by wt.nickel. The nickel aluminum alloy is suitably employed in the form of particles or granules, preferably 36 to 90 microns 165 to 400 mesh in size, more preferably 36 to 53 microns 270 to 400 mesh in size. The electrically conductive cathode substrate can have various configurations, e.g., flat, tubular, fingers, etc., but in any case should be foraminous, e.g., woven wire screen, expanded sheet metal or punched sheet metal. Iron, ferrous alloys such as mild steel and stainless steel, nickel and nickel alloys are particularly suitable materials for this substrate. It is another requirement of the present invention that the nickel aluminum alloy composition be deposited on the cathode substrate with the use of plasma spraying, also termed plasma arc spraying.Plasma spraying is a known technique for depositing metal particles onto a substrate. Briefly, streams of a gas and the metal particles are separately fed to a spray nozzle. torch , and there is an electrical power input to the gas stream which ionizes the gas recombination of the positive ions and electrons in the gas stream after mixing with the metal particles releases energy which heats and partially melts the metal particles, and the partially melted metal particles adhere to the substrate on contact with it. Various gases, including nitrogen and argon, are suitable gases for this purpose. Argon is a preferred gas. The power input need only be sufficient to partially melt the metal particles, e.g. 20 to 30 kilowatts in apparatus df ordinary size. In most cases it is preferred to coat the fabricated cathode component rather than to coat the foraminous sheet material used to fabricate the cathode, because welding and other assembly techniques are more easily accomplished with the substrate in the uncoated condition. Also, it is best to clean the surface of the substrate before coating, as by sandblasting, or blasting with other grit such as alumina. The cathodes of this invention can be either one side or two side coated. However if only one side is coated it is preferred to coat the side which will face the membrane or diaphragm in order to obtain the maximum reduction in cell voltage. Thickness of the nickel aluminum alloy coating applied to the cathode substrate of about 13 to 508 microns 0.5 to 20 mils is suitable, and is preferably about 127 to 254 microns 5 to 10 mils . Following deposition of the nickel aluminum alloy composition on the substrate, the Raney nickel surface is developed by contacting the coated article with any strong base such as a caustic solution so as to leach aluminum from the coating. The concentration of the caustic is not critical aqueous caustic solution containing 5 to 15 by wt. NaOH is suitable for this purpose, and 5 hours to 1 day is adequate time for the leaching. A 10 by wt. aqueous caustic solution for 16 hours is typical. Similarly, the temperature for leaching is not critical temperatures from room temperature up to the boilihg point of the caustic solution are suitable. For coatings of indicated thickness, about 70 to 90 of the aluminum will ordinarily be removed during such leaching some aluminum appears to remain even after.much longer leaching time, but is believed not to be deleterious to performance of the resulting cathode.This leaching step is also referred to as activation, and can be carried out prior to or after assembly of the cell. The Raney nickel cathode so made, if permitted to dry, heats up upon contact with air, due to the pyrophoric character of Raney nickel. The Raney nickel coated cathode so made not only exhibits low hydrogen overvoltage, but the coating has improved durability against flaking and spalling, as is shown hereinbelow in Example 9 andComparative Examples B, C and D. As shown therein, the nickel aluminum alloy composition applied as the coating in the process of the present invention provides an activated Raney nickel cathode surface which unexpectedly is much more resistant against spalling and flaking than those derived from alloys which contain 55 by wt. nickel or less, which spall at a commercially unacceptable rate. Also as shown therein, although all the compositions tested initially showed good reductions in hydrogen overvoltage, the improvement in hydrogen overvoltage unexpectedly was maintained at a higher level following wash bake cycles in the case of the nickel aluminum alloy composition applied as the coating in the process of the present invention than did those containing lesser 55 by wt. nickel and lower and greater 62 by wt. nickel amounts of nickel. The cathode made by the process herein can be used as the cathode in known types of electrochemical cells which comprise a cathode compartment a cathode disposed within said cathode compartment, an anode compartment, an anode disposed within said anode compartment, and a separator disposed between the anode and cathode compartments.It is especially useful in chloralkali cells of such description. The separator can be, e.g., a liquid permeable diaphragm such diaphragm can be fabricated of, e.g., asbestos fibers or perfluorinated polymer fibers. The separator can alternatively be a membrane, e.g., of highly fluorinated or perfluorinated ion exchange polymer membrane of such polymer containing sulfonate and or carboxylate groups is now well known in the chloralkali art, e.g., U.S. 4,192,725, U.S. 4,065,366 andU.S. 4,178,218. As is now known in this art, such membrane cells can be operated in both narrow gap 1 3 mm spacing from anode to cathode and zero gap both electrodes in contact with the membrane configurations. In a chloralkali process for electrolysis of an alkali metal chloride such as sodium chloride in such a cell, an aqueous alkali metal chloride solution is introduced into the anode compartment, an electric current is passed through the cell, an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution is removed from the cathode compartment and chlorine is removed from the anode compartment. In a membrane cell, water or dilute alkali metal hydroxide at startup is generally introduced into the cathode compartment, and spent alkali metal chloride solution is removed from the anode compartment. In a diaphragfl cd of the unreacted alkali metal chloride solution percolates through the diaphragm into the cathode compartment, and is removed along with the product caustic. The present invention has numerous advantages when compared to the prior art. These include 1 high resistance to flaking, spalling and mechanical damage of the activated coating 2 resistance to oxidizing atmospheres, such as heating in air, e.g., during baking of a diaphragm thereon 3 low hydrogen overvoltage compared to mild steel cathodes and Ni cathodes 4 good tolerance to moderate amounts of contamination by iron overplating 5 a variety of substrates including mild steel, stainless steel and nickel can be used 6 low cost and convenient application to preconstructed cathode components and 7 the substrate is rarely heated above 2000C, so that warping is minimal. To further illustrate the innovative aspects of the present invention, the following examples are provided. In the examples, abbreviations are used as follows PTFE refers to polytetrafluoroethylene TFE EVE refers to a copolymer of tetrafluoro ethylene and methyl perfluoro 4,7 dioxa 5 methyl 8 nonenoate TFE PSEPVE refers to a copolymer of tetra fluoroethylene and perfluoro 3,6 dioxa 4 methyl 7 octenesulfonyl fluoride EW refers to equivalent weight.

The cell had anode and cathode compartments separated by a membrane of a perfluorinated ion exchange polymer having sulfonate groups the area of membrane in use was circular, 3.5 cm in diameter. The anode was a platinum screen. A reference standard calomel electrode and the cathode to be tested were placed in the cathode compartment, with the calomel electrode as close as possible to, or in contact with, the cathode under test.The anode compartment was filled with a sodium chloride solution 250g NaCl liter of solution the cathode compartment was filled with a sodium chloride sodium hydroxide solution containing about 13 sodium hydroxide 3 liters of the aboveNaCl solution, 1.5 liters water and 585g NaOH .Electrolysis was carried out at a current density of 15.5 A dm2 at ca. 90 C, until stable electrode potentials were attained. The difference in potential between the test cathode and reference calomel electrode was measured with a high impedance digital voltmeter at intervals throughout the electrolysis period. The performance was compared against an uncoated mild steel cathode, and the results given below are reported as the millivolts advantage for the coated cathode vs. mild steel. Each test cathode was then subjected to a sequence of water spray at 1.03 x 107 Pa 1500 psi for 3 minutes on each side of the cathode to simulate the conditions of removal of a spent asbestos diaphragm and baking at 3550C for 4 hours to simulate the baking a newly applied asbestos diaphragm, even though no asbestos was actually removed or deposited. The amount of Raney nickel coating which spalled off during the water spraying was collected by filtration and weighed. The cell performance of the washed and baked cathode was again evaluated.This sequence was carried out ten times for each test cathode. The results are summarized in Tables I andII.
