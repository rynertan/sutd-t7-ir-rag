# Ignition system for post mixed burner.

## Abstract
Post mixed burner apparatus capable of igniting a combustible gas mixture of fuel and oxidant discharged from the burner comprising a first passage means for supplying fuel gas and a second passage means for supplying oxidant gas, both of said passage means 1, 2 terminating at the discharge end 4 of the apparatus. An igniting system consisting of the two electrically conductive passage means 1, 2 . The second passage means being spaced from the first passage means such that the breakdown voltage between the both passage means 1, 2 is lowest at the discharge end 4 of the apparatus, whereby the electrical discharge occurs only across the space between the both passage means 1, 2 at the discharge end 4 .
