## Description
MEMBRANE GAS SEPARATION PROCESSES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention pertains to membrane gas separation processes where there is at least one permeating gaseous species present which may be unduly detrimental to the utility of a polymeric membrane for the intended gas separation. The viability of the use of polymeric membranes for gas separat Qn, as compared to other separation procedures such as absorption, adsorption, and liquefaction, often depends on the cost of the permeation apparatus and its operating cost. Such cost factors include energy consumption, degree of selectivity of separation whioh is desired, the total pressure drop of gas components through the permeation apparatus which can be tolerated in conducting the separation procedure, the size and ease of use of such permeation apparatus, and especially the useful life of membranes in the operating environment.In order for selective separation of the one or more desired components in a gaseous stream by the use of polymeric gas separation membranes to be commercially attractive, the membranes must provide an adequately selective separation of one or more desired components at a suffi ciently high flux. That is, the selective permeation rate of the desired permeating gas species per unit of membrane surface area must be sufficiently high. Moreover, the membranes must also be capable of withstanding the environmental conditions to which they may be subjected during the separation operation, so that the useful life of membranes used to effect the separation is economically attractive. Polymeric gas separation membranes are often prepared in flat film and in hollow fiber form. Flat film membranes may not be as attractive as other membrane configurations due to the need for film membranes to be supported to withstand operating conditions such as high pressure differentials and due to the overall complexity of the permeation apparatus containing flat film membranes.Membranes in the configuration of hollow fibers avoid many of the deficiencies of flat film membranes for many separation operations.Hollow fiber membranes are generally self supporting, even under operating conditions of high differential pressures, and can provide a substantially greater amount of membrane surface area per unit volume of separation apparatus than that which may be provided by flat film membranes. Thus membrane separation apparatus containing hollow fiber membranes may be attractive from the standpoint of convenience, size and reduced complexity of design. However, in order to provide permeation apparatus which is commercially viable on an economic basis, any membrane, even if inherently capable of providing desired selectivities of separation, fluxes and strength, must also be capable of maintaining these desired properties over an extended period of time in what may be an adverse operating environment. This extended period of time is denoted the useful life of the membrane. A particularly convenient analytical characteristic of polymeric gas permeable membranes includes the permeability of the membrane for a specific gas through the membrane. The permeability a of a membrane for gas al of a gas mixture through a membrane of thickness Q is the volume of gas, referred to standard temperature and pressure STP , which passes through the membrane per unit of surface area of membrane, per unit of time, per unit of differential partial pressure of the permeating species across the thickness of the membrane.One method for expressing permeabilities is cubic centimeters STP per square centimeter of membrane area per second per differential partial pressure of 1 centimeter of mercury across the membrane thickness cm STP cmê sec cmHg . Unless otherwise noted, all permeabilities are reported herein at standard temperatures and pressures of 15.60C. and 1 bar, respectively. The permeabilities are reported in gas permeation units GPU , which are cm3 sTp cm2 sec cmHg x iO6 thus 1 GPU is 1 x 106 cm3 STP cm2 sec cmHg. Another convenient relationship for express ing gas permeation characteristics of membranes is separation factor.A separation factor, a b, for a membrane for a given pair of gases a and b is defined as the ratio of the permeability Pa t L of a membrane of thickness t for a gas a of a gas mixture to the permeability Pblt of the same membrane to gas b . In practice, separation factor with respect to a given pair of gases for a given membrane can be determined by employing numerous techniques which provide sufficient information for calculation of permeabilities for each. of the gases. Several of the many techniques available for determining permeabilities and separation factors are disclosed by Hwang, petal., Techniques ofChemistry, Volume VII, Membranes in Separations, John Wiley Sons, 1974, at Chapter 12, pages 296 322. Measurements can be made for pure gas permeation or for blend gas permeation, However, experience has shown that the measured permeability of a membrane for a gas species is higher for pure gas permeation than for blend gas permeation. In general, it is more desirable to determine gas permeation characteristics for blend gases, since the permeabilities and separation factors more closely predict actual membrane gas separation performance characteristics. Ideally it is preferred to have a polymeric membrane with no deterioration of permeability with time However, deterioration of permeability is generally observed, resulting in less than desirable membrane performance. Accordingly much effort has been directed to developing polymeric membrane materials with enhanced permeation stability. Effort has also been directed to determining operating environments which produce the highest permeation performance as measured in terms of permeability and separation factor, with the lowest deterioration of permeability. A particularly valuable analytical tool for evaluating the stability of polymeric membrane permeability properties is the measurement of permeability creep. Permeability creep is defined as the time rate of change of permeability of a particular gas species through a membrane. A convenient method for determining permeability creep is provided by the slope of the relationship of the logarithm of permeability of a species through the membrane as a function of the logarithm of time. See, for instance, Figure 1, which is a log log plot of permeability o a membrane of thickness t for species i P1 l , versus time t .Experience has shown that such a relationship is conveniently approximated by a straight line whose negative slope defines permeability creep according to the following relationship, illustrated by Figure 1.EMI4.1 Since units of the fractions of the logarithms cancel, permeability creep is a dimensionless number. And, if permeability diminishes with time as it usually does , permeability creep is a negative number, for instance 0.1. The permeability ate changes with time may also be expressed as an exponential function of the form PaIL 2 Pa l 1 t2It1 m, where Pa l 2 is the permeability of the membrane of thickness z for gas a at time t2 Pa IL 1 is the permeability of the same membrane of thickness ç for the same gas a at an earlier time 11t110 and m is the slope of a logarithmic plot of permeability versus time. The value of m represents permeability creep. Since the economic viability of membrane separation processes depends to a significant degree on the performance of the membrane system with time, permeability creep is a key indicator of the useful life of the membrane as illustrated in the following Table I. TABLE I PERMEABILITY, P g 2 CGPUI Time in OperationPermeability any elapsed time unit Creep m 1 12 60 0.01 100 GPU 98 GPU 96 GPU 0.03 100 93 88 0.07 100 84 75 0.10 100 78 66 0.20 100 61 44 The data in Table I illustrate that a membrane having a permeability creep of 0.20 would be generally undesirable as compared to a membrane having a permeability creep of 0.01. That is, the economic life of a membrane having a permeability creep of 0.20 deferiorates significantly within a short time for instance, by about 40X between time increments 1 and 12.On the other hand, the economic life of a membrane having a permeability creep of 0.01 would experience only minor deterioration in a similar time period for instance, about 2Z between time increments 1 and Often gas mixtures for which a membrane gas separation is desired may contain one or more species which may be detrimental to the operating characteristics of the polymeric membranes, for instance to the permeability of gases through the membrane. Such species may adversely affect the polymeric membrane for instance, by solvation, plasticization, or swelling. Often the adverse effect on the polymeric membrane may be a significant reduction in permeability, a significant reduction in strength of the membrane, or a reduction in selectivity of the membrane for one desired permeating gas over the other permeating gases.The adverse effects may be rapidly catastrophic or may be manifested in a gradual degradation of desired properties over time. Accordingly such adverse effects can often be monitored by measuring permeability creep. The adversely affecting species may be present in trace amounts or may even be present in significantly high quantities.For instance, in the case of a membrane gas separation process for the recovery of hydrogen from industrial gas streams such as purge streams from an ammonia synthesis loop, the adversely affecting species may be ammonia, NH3. In othe cases, such as the membrane gas separation of hydrogen from a refinery purge stream, the adversely affecting species may be an aromatic species such as toluene. Depending on the particular membrane, adversely affecting species, such as ammonia, an aromatic species, or water, may be detrimental to the membrane even if the concentration, as measured in terms of partial pressure, of the adversely affecting species is relatively low. In other cases for instance in the separation of an acid gas such as carbon dioxide or hydrogen sulfide from hydrocarbon gases such as methane the acid gas is often present in substantial concentrations and is the predominant permeating species. Unfortunately, an acid gas, such as carbon dioxide or hydrogen sulfide, can have an adverse effect on a polymeric membrane of such material as, for instance, polysulfone. In this regard it is known oChat an acid gas, such as carbon dioxide, can under some conditions plasticize an otherwise rigid structure of a polymeric material such as polysulfone.A membrane of plasticized polymeric material is expected to deform under th 0stress of differentials in pressure imposed across the membrane to effect permeation. For instance, it has been found that when a polymeric hollow fiber membrane is exposed to a feed gas mixture of carbon dioxide and methane, the permeability of carbon dioxide PCO2 l and the permeability of methane PCH Q tend to decrease as the partial CH4 pressure of carbon dioxide is increased from, for instance, about 2 8 kg cmê to about 8.4 kg cmê. Moreover, it has been found that certain polymeric hollow fiber membranes when exposed to high concentrations of carbon dioxide in the feed gas mixture for extended periods of time will exhibit undesirable permeability creep, for instance, in the range of 0.1 or even more negative. What has been discovered is that polymeric membranes can be successfully operated to separate adversely affecting gas species from a gaseous mixture under conditions previously expected to be adverse with little permeability creep and with enhanced permeability. For instance, by the membrane separation process of this discovery, an adversely affecting species such as an acid gas like carbon dioxide can be advantageously separated from a hydrocarbon gas like methane by selective permeation through a polymeric membrane not only without the previously expected adverse effect of high permeability creep, but also with enhanced permeability of carbon dioxide and enhanced separation factor of carbon dioxide to methane. The effect of specific adversely affecting species varies, of course, depending on the polymeric membrane utilized. Some polymeric membranes are inherently more resistant to some otherwise adversely affecting species than to others. Moreover, some polymeric membranes have been shown to tolerate higher levels of otherwise adversely affecting species. What has been discovered is a process for advantageously separating an adversely affecting species by selective permeation through a polymeric membrane which exhibits substantial permeability creep, for instance, more negative than about 0.1, when exposed to critical partial pressures of the adversely affecting species. The term critical partial pressure as used herein means the gas phase concentration which describes the relationship of the permeability creep characteristics of the polymeric membrane when exposed to potentially adversely affecting gas species. The term critical partial pressure defines the gas phase concentration of an adversely affecting species at or above which the polymeric membrane will exhibit permeability creep more negative than about 0.1. Similarly, it is intended that a membrane exposed to a potentially adversely affecting species at less than the critical partial pressure will exhibit permeability creep to a substantially lesser degree, i.e., the permeability creep will generally be less negative than about 0.1. As used herein, the term critical partial pressure is intended to have no relationship to the term critical pressure , which relates to the physical constant which characterizes the pressure above which a gas cannot be liquified by a decrease in temperature. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a membrane permeation process for separating at least one gas in a gaseous mixture from at least one other gas in said gaseous mixture by selective permeation and providing a permeate gas mixture enriched in said at least one gas comprising a contacting a feed side surface of a polymeric membrane with a gaseous mixture, said membrane exhibiting selectivity to the permeation of at least one gas of said gaseous mixture and said membrane having a permeability creep more negative than about 0.1 when exposed to critical partial pressures of said at least one gas b permeating a gas mixture enriched in said at least one gas into and through the membrane to a permeate side of said membrane, said permeating being effected by maintaining the partial pressure of said at least one gas at the feed side surface of the membrane higher than the partial pressure of said at least one gas at the permeate side of the membrane c removing a non permeate gas mixture depleted in said at least one gas from the feed side surface of the membrane and d removing a permeate gas mixture enriched in said at least one gas from the permeate side of the membrane at a sufficiently 3. high rate that the partial pressure of said at least one gas at the permeate side of the membrane is maintained at a partial pressure less than the critical partial pressure of said at least one gas such that the permeability creep of the membrane is less negative than 0.1. The process of this invention further relates to a membrane separation process for separating at least one gas from a gaseous feed mixture containing at least one other gas which is an adversely affecting species. Such membrane separation process comprises a contacting a feed side surface of a polymeric membrane with a gaseous mixture, said membrane exhibiting selectivity to the permeation of at least one gas of said gaseous mixture and said membrane having a permeability creep more negative than about 0.1 when exposed to critical partial pressures of at least one other aas of said gaseous mixture b permeating a gas mixture enriched in said at least one gas and containing an amount of said at least one other gas into and through the membrane to a permeate side of said membrane, said permeating being effected by maintaining the partial pressure of said at least one gas at the feed side surface of the membrane higher than the partial pressure of said at least one gas at the permeate side of the membrane c removing a non permeate gas mixture depleted in said at least one gas from the feed side surface of the membrane and d removing a permeate gas mixture enriched in said at least one gas and containing an amount of said at least one other gas from the permeate side of the membrane at a sufficiently high rate that the partial pressure of said at least one other gas at the permeate side of the membrane is maintained at a partial pressure less than the critical partial pressure of said at least one other gas such that the permeability creep of the membrane is less negative than 0.1. A preferred aspect of this invention relates to a membrane separation process for separating carbon dioxide from a feed gas mixture comprising carbon dioxide and methane comprising a contacting a feed side surface of a multicomponent hollow fiber membrane with the feed gas mixture, said multicomponent hollow fiber membrane exhibiting selectivity to the permeation of carbon dioxide over that of methane and said multicomponent hollow fiber membrane having a permeability creep more negative than about 0.1 when exposed to critical partial pressures of carbon dioxide b permeating a carbon dioxide enriched gas mixture into, and through to a permeate side of, said multicomponent hollow fiber membrane, said permeating being effected by maintaining the partial pressure of carbon dioxide at the feed side surface of said multicomponent hollow fiber membrane higher than the partial pressure of carbon dioxide at the permeate side of said multicomponent hollow fiber membrane c removing a carbon dioxide depleted non permeate gas mixture from the feed side surface of said multicomponent hollow fiber membrane and d removing a carbon dioxide enriched permeate gas mixture from the permeate side of said multicomponent hollow fiber membrane at a sufficiently high rate that the partial pressure of carbon dioxide at the permeate side of said multicomponent hollow fiber membrane is maintained at a partial pressure less than the critical partial pressure of carbon dioxide such that the permeability creep of the multicomponent hollow fiber membrane is less negative than .1 . DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The process of this invention is advantageously useful in membrane gas separations where the gaseous mixture contacting the polymeric membrane contains potentially adversely affecting gas species which may be present at the permeate side of the membrane at critical partial pressures. Such potentially adversely affecting gas species may be a desired permeating gas species or simply a contaminant gas which happens to be permeated with the desired permeating gas species. Such potentially adversely affecting gas species may be condensible within the polymeric membrane and may promote significant permeability creep in the membrane for the desired permeating species by presence at the permeate side of the membrane at critical partial pressure. The process of this invention is useful for membrane gas separations where the potentially adversely affecting gas species is a gas such as water an aromatic gas like benzene, toluene or xylene a sulfur containing gas like hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, sulfur trioxide, carbonyl sulfide, or methyl mercaptan a nitrogen containing gas such as ammonia, a nitrogen oxide or a cyanogen gas a carbon containing gas such as carbon dioxide or other substituted methyl gases or combinations of such gases and the like. The process of this invention is particularly advantageous for separating acid gas components such as carbon dioxide andlor hydrogen sulfide from a gas mixture containing hydrocarbon gases for instance, methane, ethane, propane, butane, etc. The polymeric membranes useful in the process of this invention comprise polymeric membranes in flat film or hollow fiber form. Anisotropic membranes are generally more useful for membrane gas separations. Such anisotropic membranes have a thin, dense layer, usually on at least one surface of the membrane, which comprises an open cellular support matrix. It is generally desirable that the thin, dense layer be on the outer surface of the anisotropic polymeric hollow fiber membranes.The preferred anisotropic polymeric hollow fiber membranes useful in this invention are multicomponent membranes comprising a coating in occluding contact with a porous separation membrane of material which exhibits selective permeation of at least one gas of the gaseous mixture over that of one or more remaining gases in the gaseous mixture. Such multicomponent membranes are described in United States Patent 4,230,463, issuedOctober 28, 1980. Other hollow fiber membranes useful in the process of this invention can be provided by a number of techniques known to those skilled in the hollow fiber membrane art. Particularly useful procedures for preparing such membranes are set forth by Brooks, et al., in Belgian Patent 882,475, granted September 29, 1980.The polymeric material comprising such membranes is preferably selected on the basis of its separation capabilities, for instance, its ability to provide the desired selectivity of separation in a suitable permeate flux while maintaining sufficient strength and chemical resistance, particularly with respect to the components of the fluid streams intended to be treated using the membrane. The selective permeation of many fluids, including gases, in many polymers has been reported. In these reported permeations, the mechanism of the separation apparently involves an interaction with the material of the membrane. Hence widely differing separation capabilities can be achieved by the use of different polymers. For instance, polyacrylonitrile permits nitrogen to permeate over ten times as quickly as methane whereas in a polysulfone membrane methane may permeate slightly more quickly than nitrogen. Typical polymers which may be suitable for making membranes useful in the process of this invention include substituted and unsubstituted polymers selected from polysulfones polyethersulfones poly styrenes , including styrene containing copolymers such as acrylonitrile styrene copolymers and styrene vinylbenzylhalide copolymers polyzarbonates cellulosic polymers, such as cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose propionate, ethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, nitrocellulose, etc. polyamides and polyimides, including aryl polyamides and aryl polyimides polyethers polyacetal polyCarylene oxides such as poly phenylene oxide and polyCxylylene oxide poly esteramide d socyanate polyurethanes polyesters including polyarylates , such as polyEethylene terephthalate , polyCalkyl methacrylates , polyCalkyl acrylates , poly phenylene terephthalate , etc. polysulfides polymers from monomers having alpha olefinic unsaturation other than mentioned above, such as polyvinyls, e.g., poly vinyl chloride , poly vinyl fluoride , poly vinylidene chloride , polyCvinylidene fluoride , poly vinyl alcohol polyvinyl esters such as poly vinyl acetate and polyCvinyl propionate , polyvinyl pyridines , poly vinyl pyrrolidones , poly vinyl ethers , polyvinyl ketones poly vinyl aldehydes such as poly vinyl formal and polyvinyl butyral , poly vinyl amines , polyvinyl phosphates , and polyvinyl sulfates polyallyls poly benzobenzimidazole polyhydrazides polyoxadiazoles polytriazoles poWy benzimidazole polycarbodii mides polyphosphazines, etc. and interpolymers including block interpolymers containing repeating units from the above, such as terpolymers of acrylonitrile vinyl bromide sodium salt of parasulfophenylmethallyl ethers and grafts and blends containing any of the foregoing.Typical substituents providing substituted polymers include halogens such as fluorine, chlorine and bromine hydroxyl groups lower alkyl groups lower alkoxy groups monocyclic aryl lower acryl groups etc. One class of polymers which may be attractive for many gas separations are copolymers of styrene and acrylonitrile, or terpolymers containing styrene and acrylonitrile. Frequently the styrene is up to about 60 or 70, say, about 10 to 50 mole percent of the total monomer in the polymer. Advantageously the acrylonitrile monomer comprises at least about ZO, e.g., about 20 to 90, often about 30 to 80 mole percent of the polymer. Other monomers which may be employed with styrene and acrylonitrile to provide, for instance, terpolymers, include olefinic monomers such as butene, butadiene, methylacrylate, methylmethacrylate, maleic anhydride, and the like. Other monomers which may be. employed include vinyl chloride.The copolymers or terpolymers of styrene and acrylonitrile often have an average molecular weight of at least about 25,000 or 50,000 say about 75,000 to 500,000 or more. One of the preferred polymers for anisotropic membranes is polysulfone, due to its strength, chemical resistance and relatively good gas separation capabilities. Typical polysulfones are characterized by having a polymeric backbone comprised of the repeating structural unit EMI13.1 where R and R1 can be the same or different and are aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbyl containing moieties, say, of 1 to about 40 carbon atoms, wherein the sulfur in the sulfonyl group is bonded to aliphatic or aromatic carbon atoms, and the polysulfone has an average molecular weight suitable for film or fiber formation, often at least about 8,000 or 10,000. When the polysulfone is not crosslinked, the molecular weight of the polysulfone is generally less than about 500,000 and is frequently less than about 100,000. The relating units may be bonded i.e., R and R1 may be bonded by carbon to carbon bonds or through various linking groups such asEMI13.2 Particularly advantageous polysulfones are those in which at least one of R and R comprises an aromatic hydrocarbyl containing moiety and the sulfonyl moiety is bonded to at least one aromatic carbon atom. Common aromatic hydrocarbyl containing moieties comprise phenylene and substituted phenylene moieties, bisphenyl and substitutedbisphenyl moieties, bisphenyl methane and substituted bisphenyl methane moieties having the nucleusEMI13.3 substituted and unsubstituted bisphenyl ethers of formulaEMI14.1 wherein X is oxygen or sulfur and the like.In the depicted bisphenyl methane and bisphenyl ether moieties, R3 to R12 represent substituents which may be the same or different and have the structureEMI14.2 wherein X1 and Xz are the same or different and are hydrogen or halogen Ce.g., fluorine, chlorine, and bromine p is O or an integer e.g., of 1 to about 6 and Z is hydrogen, halogen e.g., fluorine, chlorine and bromine , Y qR13 in which q is O or 1 Y is O , SO, SSO,EMI14.3 orEMI14.4 and13 is hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted or unsubstituted alkyl, say, of 1 to about 8 carbon atoms, or substituted or unsubstituted aryl, say, monocyclic orbicyclic of about 6 to 15 carbon atoms , heterocyclic with the heteroatom being at least one of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur and being monocyclic or bicyclic with about 5 to 15 ring atoms, sulfato and sulfono, especially lower alkyl containing or monocyclic or bicyclic aryl containing sulfato or sulfono, phosphorous containing moieties such as phosphino and phosphato and phosphono, especially lower alkyl containing or monocyclic or bicyclic aryl containing phosphato or phosphono, amine including primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary amines often containing lower alkyl or monocyclic or bicyclic aryl moieties, isothioureyl, thioureyl, guanidyl, trialkylsilyl, trialkyistannyl, trialkyiplumbyl, dialkylstibinyl, etc. Frequently the substituents on the phenylene groups of the bisphenyl methane and bisphenyl ether moieties are provided as at least one of R3 to R6, and W to R10 are hydrogen. The polysulfones having aromatic hydrocarbyl ontaining moieties in general possess good thermal stability, are resistant to chemical attack, and have an excellent combination of toughness and flexibility. Useful polysulfones are sold under trade names such as P 1700 and P 3500 by Union Carbide. Both commercial products are bisphenot methane derived polysulfones specifically, bisphenolA derived having a linear chain of the general formulaEMI15.1 where n, representing the degree of polymerization, is about 50 to 80. PolyEarylene ether sulfones are also advantageous. Polyether sulfones having the structureEMI15.2 are available from ICS, Ltd., Great Britain, and are also useful.Still other useful polysulfones could be prepared through polymer modifications, for example, by cross linking, grafting, quarternization, etc. Other advantageous polymers include polyimides and polyphenylene oxides, including substituted polyphenylene oxides such as brominated polyphenylene oxides. Polymeric membranes useful in this invention are generally assembled into a permeator which allows for proper distribution of the feed gas mixture to the feed side surface of the membrane for effective separation and removal of the non permeate and permeate gases. Polymeric membranes in hollow fiber form are particularly attractive in that the hollow fibers are generally self supporting, even at relatively high differential pressures, and provide a greater amount of membrane surface area per unit volume of permeator than that which may be provided by flat film membranes. Thus permeators containing hollow fiber membranes may be attractive from the standpoint of convenience, size and reduced complexity in design.Commercially attractive permeators must be able to withstand the operating conditions to which they may be subjected during separation operations and should be relatively non conplex and easily assembtable to facilitate manufacturing.A variety of permeator desig ns utilizing hollow fiber membranes hhve been developed for separation operations. Generally hollow fiber membranes are arranged in the form of a bundle embedded in at least one tube sheet which is sealed in a permeator shell.Among the useful designs are those disclosed by Rosenblatt InUnited States Patent 3,616,928 Maxwell, et al., in United StatesPatent 3,339,341 McLain in United States Patent 3,422,008 Caracciolo in United States Patent 3,528,553 Mcflamara, et al., inUnited States Patent 3,702,658 and King, et al., in United StatesPatent 4,315,819. The membrane separation processes of this invention are useful for numerous gas separation applications, since the polymeric membrane can be selected from a very large group of materials depending on the permeation properties of the material for the desired gas separation. Illustrative of such gas separation applications are hydrogen separations from gas mixtures containing, for instance, nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, argon, ammonia or aromatic species carbon dioxide andlor hydrogen sulfide separation from gas mixtures containing, for instance, hydrocarbon gases like methane, ethane, and the like and carbon dioxide separations from fossil fuel combustion gases which may contain water, nitrogen and nitrogen oxides, among other gases. The process of this invention is advantageously useful in separating acid gas such as carbon dioxide andlor hydrogen sulfide from gas mixtures of, for instance, hydrocarbon gases such as methane, ethane, propane, and the like. Such gas mixtures are common in the petroleum and natural gas industries. For instance, in enhanced oil recovery processes utilizing carbon dioxide flooding, the casinghead gas from wellheads often comprises predominantly carbon dioxide and methane. It is desirable to separate these two gases, for instance, so that carbon dioxide can be reinjected for further enhanced oil recovery and so that methane can be provided for natural gas pipelines. In other instances, natural gas reservoirs often contain substantial quantities of carbon dioxide andlor hydrogen sulfide which must be removed before the predominantly methane containing hydrocarbon gas can be utilized. In still a further instance, it is possible to recover substantial quantities of methane by separating the carbon dioxide and methane Containing gas present in mature landfills. Traditionally the required separations for removing gases such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide have included amine scrubbing, physical absorption and cryogenic processes, among others. Membrane gas separations can provide an economically attractive alternative for, or adjunct to, such traditional processes. However, gases such as carbon dioxide andlor hydrogen sulfide often adversely affect the economic life of polymeric membranes useful in such membrane separation processes, resulting in significant permeability creep of otherwise desirable polymeric membranes. By the use of the process of this invention, the membrane gas separation of acid gas species such as carbon dioxide andlor hydrogen sulfide can be advantageously effected without the detrimental effects of permeability creep when the partial pressure of such acid gas species is maintained below the critical partial pressure of the acid gas species such that oermeabilitr.creeD for the polymeric membrane is less negative than 0.1. For instance, a multicomponent hollow fiber membrane comprising a coating of polysitoxane in occluding contact with a porous anisotropic hollow fiber membrane of polysulfone can be used to separate carbon dioxide from a mixture of carbon dioxide and methane by selective permeation of the carbon dioxide.However, it has been observed that such multicomponent hollow fiber membranes will exhibit a permeability creep more negative than about 0.1 when the partial pressure of carbon dioxide on the permeate side of the membrane is greater than the critical partial pressure of carbon dioxide for instance, about 217 psia 15 kglcm2 , or even lower. Moreover, a permeability creep of about 0.1 has been observed for the same multicomponent hollow fiber membrane when the partial pressure of carbon dioxide at the permeate side of the membrane is at 100 psia 7.03 kg cm2 .On the other hand, when the same multicomponent hollow fiber membrane is used in a membrane separation process such that the partial pressure of carbon dioxide at the permeate side of the membrane is maintained below the critical partial pressure of carbon dioxide, for instance, at 73.4 psia 5.16 kg cmê , the membrane will exhibit a permeability creep generally less negative than 0.1, say about 0.02. The following examples are provided to assist in the under standing of the invention and are not in limitation of the invention. EXAMPLE S This example illustrates the tendency of a membrane to exhibit diminished performance characteristics when exposed to increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the range from about 18 volume X to about 36 volume X in a feed gas mixture. A permeator was prepared utilizing multicomponent hollow fiber membranes comprising a coating of polysiloxane Dow CorningSylgard 184 in occluding contact with a porous anisotropic hollow fiber membrane of polysulfone Union Carbide P 3500 . One end of a bundle of the hollow fiber membranes was sealed in a cured epoxy resin tuEe sheet such that the bores of the hollow fiber membranes communicated through the tube sheet. The other end of the hollow fiber membrane was sealed. The assembly of the bundle of hollow fiber membranes and tube sheet was sealed into an elongated tubular steel shell, having an inlet port and longitudinally distant outlet port to provide axial flow of a feed gas mixture through the shell in contact with the exterior surface of the hollow fiber membranes.A port was also provided to allow permeate gas to be evacuated from the bores of the hollow fiber membranes. A feed gas mixture was flowed through the permeator at about 6 SCFM 47.2 cm thin under conditions stated in Table II. Feed gas mixtures of carbon dioxide and hydrocarbon gases were provided, with carbon dioxide partial pressure ranging from about 40 psia 2.8 kg cm2 to about 80 psia 5.6 kg cm2 .

EXAMPLE II This example illustrates the significantly adverse levels of permeability creep of a membrane when exposed to high concentrations of carbon dioxide. A permeator utilizing multicomponent hollow fiber membranes was prepared as in Example I. A feed gas mixture of 70 volume X carbon dioxide and 30 volume methane was provided to the permeators which was operated under conditions stated in Table III. The permeabilities of the membrane for carbon dioxide decreased with time, as shown in Table III.

EXAMPLE III This example illustrates the process of this invention where stable membrane permeation is achieved. Two permeators utilizing multicomponent hollow fiber membranes were prepared as in Example I. Membrane gas separations of feed gas mixtures comprising carbon dioxide and methane were simultaneously performed for 17 days after stable operation was established, under average process conditions set forth in Table IV. The permeability of the multicomponent hollow fiber membranes for carbon dioxide were calculated from data measurements and are set forth in Table V. The permeability creep was determined to be 0.1 for permeator A, which operated with the permeate gas mixture having a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 100 psia 7.03 kg cm2 on the bore side surface of the multicomponent hollow fiber membrane. The permeability creep was determined to be 0.02, or essentially 0 cwrsidering experimental error in the measured data, forpermeatnr B, which operated with a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 73.4 psia 5.16 kg cmê on the bore side surface of the multicomponent hollow fiber membrane.

After stable operation was achieved, the permeability of the multicomponent hollow fiber membrane for carbon dioxide was calculated from permeability data measurements which are set forth in Table VI. The permeability creep was determined to be essentially 0, indicating stable membrane performance.
