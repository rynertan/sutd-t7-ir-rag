# Windscreen wiper autonomous device.

## Abstract
The device is provided with two probes S1 and S2 that are placed on the external side of the windscreen of a vehicle and comprise a comb shaped element 100 and a linear element 101, both of which are conductors. The former is opposite and close to a further comb shaped element 102 that is subjected to a positive potential Q derived from the dashboard of the vehicle, while the element 101 is a greater distance away from the comb shaped element 102. When the rain closes the contact between the element 102 and probe S1 or S2, the said probes create signals that are suitably recognized by a control circuit of the windscreen wiper motor MT that comprises a detection regulation circuit CP which, through a control circuit CT, attends to transferring suitable signals to a pilot interface IP for the motor MT to be operated at the first or at the second speed or for it to be halted.

## Description
Windscreen wipar autonomous aperation deviceThe invention relates t a device which, using special probes placed on the windscreen of the vehicle and able to supply suitable signals in the event of rain, can cause, via a detection regulation circuit, a control circuit dolmstreav of the former, and a pilot interface, every one of the functions of the windscreen wiper motor to operate in a fully autonomous fashion.As is knows, when rain falls, vehicle windscreen wipers are operated at one or more speeds by the user him or herself.The switching on and off of the windscreen wipers, as also varying the speed thereof, are tasks entrusted solely to the user.The main object of the invention is, therefore, to allow windscreen wipers to operate in a filly autonomous fashion, without the user having to operate or ary the speed of the windscreen wipers when it is raining.Another object of the invention is to make available an electronic device able, in practice, to cause the functions peculiar to the windscreen wipers to be carried out in a particularly simple way.A further important object of the invention is that of permitting the operating signals to be recognized through the natural element causing the operation, namely water.The invention, as characterized by the Claims, thus solves excellently the problem of achieving the fully autonomous operation of the windscreen wiper motor when it rains. it the use of the said device herein it is envisaged t 9 t e probes placec on the windscreen rall within the radius of action of the wiper blades, t le result is achieved, on account of the special conformation of the said probes and the for of constraction of the said electronic cirout interposed between the said probes and the windscreen wiper rotor, of the circuit placed downstream of the probes bein energized only when it is raining and, if it is so wised, cf the windscreen wipers being operated at more than one speed.The main adventages are obvicusly that the driver of the vehicle is freed from having to operate or regulate, at the time rain is falling, the windscreen wipers, without his or her vision being minimally obstructed since the said probes are made of extremely thin condution material.Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the detailed description that follows, illustrated purely as an unlimited example on the accompanying drawings, in which e Figure 1 outlines the device in question Pigure 2 showe a first embodiment for operation the wind screen wipers at one single speed Figure 3 shows, as an example, a first construction of the circuit of the device in question, whereby the wind screen wipers are able to operate at two speeds Pigure 4 show a simplified solution alternative to that depicted in Figure 3 1 Figures 5a and 5b show two possible solutions for the ar rangeent of the probes on the windscreen of the vehicle. ith reference to the above mentiened drawings, the devioe in question advantageously utilizes, in part, the orthodox circuit for manually operated windscreen wipers.The said orthodox circuit envisages provision being made for a hand operated lever for switching on the windscreen wipers, constituted by a double throw switch C2 C2 in which the configuration of the contact C2, connected to the posit ive potential Z derived from the dashboard of the vehicle, varies from a first inactive position MO, with the contact 01 earthing the supply to a motor ViT through what is called an internal switch C3 of the said motor, to a second active position in which the contact C2 supplies the potential n to the motor ffiT, wit the contact 2 open.In the case depicted in Figure 2, where the device operates at one speed cnly, one single active position M1 is provided for the contact 02, while as regards Figures 3 and 4 provision is made for twe active positions M1 and M2 for the first and second speed, respectively. luring the rotation of the motor T, the internal switch C3 is put alternately to earth and in contact with the positive potential BT of the battery.The main operating characteristic of the device morning the subject of the invention is that it is designed to operate in an autonomous fashion and not in the orthodox manual way.Entrusted with the changeover from manual to autonomous op eration is a main switch CA, connected to the positive potential Q on the dashboard, the configuration of which varies from a position N in which the potertial Q is connected to the said contact 73 or nual lever, to a position in which the potential . is carried to a corrb shaped conductor element 102 mounted on the windscreen Figures 5a and 5b .The said element 102 faces another comb shaped element 100 that defines the probe S1. In the case of operation at Lore than one speed, 2 robe D2 is constituted by a linear element 101 spaced a greater distance away from the conb shaped element 102 than the probe S1 or element 100. In tis way, when the rain closes at least one of the contacts between S1 and the element 102, the probe Si is able to create a corresponding signal.When heavier rain is fall ing that succeeds in closing the contact between the element 102 and the probe S2, a fresh signal characteristic of the second speed of the windscreen wipers is created. a said main switch C also supplies the entire electronic control circuit of the motor T. In the case illustrated in Figure 2, that is to say when the wipers operate only at the said first speed, the electronic circuit referred to above is constituted b an amplifier CPA, the input of which picks up the signal created by the probe S1, while the output of nice supplies a signal K when the probe S1 is alive to a control circuit OT constituted by an ordinary transistor amplifier T1 whose output is supplied to a relayRC provided to control a pilot interface IP that also con tains the said orthodox manual operation circuit. When excited, the relay RC causes, in particular, the changeover of a double throw switch Ca Ca from the inactive position shown in Figure 2, in which the contact Ca is open and the contact Ca connects the internal switch 3 te earth, to the active position in which the contactCa is open and the contact Ca places the moter MT in com munication with the pesitive potential BT of teh battery, via the s id contort C2 . n he active position of the double throw switch Ca Ca , the windscreen wipers start operatin autonomcuslg as a function of the continuous cycles supplied by the internal switch C3, for as long as the probe 1 stays alive.Once it is no longer energized, namely when the rain has ceased, the said double throw switch returns to the inactive position and when the inter nal switch C3 is in the position depicted in Figure 2, the motor stops running. en The device in question is provided for operation at two or mcre speeds and there are, for example, the probesC1 and S2 in the compesition thereof, the device, shown diagrammatically in Figure 1,can take the form illustrated in either Figure 3 or Figune 4. either the resistive nor the capacitive elements kave been numbered in the said figures since it was felt unnecessary tc do so. In the case illustrated in Figure 3, the detection regulation crcuit Cr ascertains, through the probes S1 and S2 at the inputs thereof, the state of these and, through suitable signals X4 and X5 forthcoming from the pilot interface IT, also ascertains whether the motorMT is set at the first or second speed and, on the basis of the information detected, is able to supply to the do stream control circuit CT, suitable signals X1, X2 and X3 which, through the transistor amplifiers 22, T3 and T4, res pectively, of the circuit CT, place the pilot interface IP in a condition to set in motion the motor MT at the first or second speed, or to stop it turning. In particular, the pilot interface Ii is provided with a Switch CA1, in series with the contect C2 , which opens when the switch n is in position A. 4 witch CA2, in series with the internal switch C3 and earthed both normally and when non operative, opens when the switch CA is in position A.A pair of thyristors TY1 and TY2 are connected in series to the potentiel ET of the battery and are also connected to the first speed winding of the motor MT. The said thy risters are placed in the conducting state by the said signal K1 and, in particular, thyristor I1 also by the signal and they supply the said signal X4 to a detection blockBR that utilizes a transistor n5 and is part of the said circuit CP. In particular, the thyristor TY1 is connected in parallel to the internal switch C3.A third thyristor m r3, that conducts thro the signal X2, is placed bet we the second speed winding of the rotor MT and the cen tral node between the thyristors TY1 and T2. The thyristorTY3 supplies the second speed signal X5 to the detection block BR.When one of the two probes S1 or S2 is energized, the said state is carried to one of the pins of an integrated cir cuit INT2 supplied stably by a power source AS via the pot ential and a diode D5. The power source, the integrated cirauit and, as stated above, the detection block BR, are all part of the circuit CP. If, for example, the active probe is S1, the integrated circuit places in the conduct ing state, through the signal X1 and the amplifier 22, the thyristors TY1 and TY2, through the diodes D7 and D9.In way, the motor KT runs at the first speed and, together with the windscreen, the wipers also clean the probe Si. Cl ld, Furing the l st phase of the aycle, cther water have fallen en to the probe suffcient to be an annoyance to the driver , the windsereen wipers are kept in operation, as they are on each similar coeasion. In this way, constant and or intermittent operation is achiaved to suit the requirements.If, instead, the ra close also the circuit between the element 102 and the probe 52, the device attends to varying the windscreen wiper speed from the rain is heavy encugh to first tr the second speed and, in turn, to returning to the fimst speed as soen as the rain decreases in intensity.hen, in particular, the probe S2 is also energized, the thyristers TY3 and TY1 are placed in the conducting state, with the other thyrister to longer cenducting since the motor t has already been brought to a standstill through the signal X3 coming from the integrated circuit, n and through the diodes D1, D2 D3, D4 and the matching transistor T6. The signal X3 stops the motor KT both for a change in the speed and when it has stopped raining. nis is on aecount of the fact of the relay RC being energized and closing a switch C that is earthed and connected to the switch C2 in the autonomous cperation position.It should also be stated that a circuital closure in the conduction of the thyristor TY3 through the diode D1 is brought about by the thyristor TY1 through the diode D8 the said thyristor 71 then being alternately shortcircuited by the contact C3.The integrated circuit LT is, therefore, able to effect, from one moment to another, a Sully autonomous control on the circuit through the signals coming form the probes and the windings of the motor. It is alsc pointed out that in order to halt the motor KT, if the sapply to the dashbar rd is turned off, it is necessary for there to be a contaet t3 which, through a diode D6, can carry the potential P of the battery to the control circuit CT. The contact 3 clcses with the switch CA in position A.In the case depicted in Figure 4, where use is made of the same integrated circuit, the same power source and the same det ation block, there are, in addition to the said switch 1, a pari of switches C and C placed in the active positi by the ralay RC which, tis tine, attends to stopping the mator MT onl when deenergized. The inactive position of the switches C and C is that shown in Figure 4 in which switch C is open and switch C is earthed.In the active position, instead, switch C is closed on to the potential of the battery and switch C is concurs in the presence of one of the signals ri, X2 or X3 that are carried, amplified, through the diodes D12 or D13 te the relay RC. hould this condition not arise, then obviously the relay RC is inactive. Use is also made in the said case of two thyristors TY2 and TY3, identical to those described previously and having exactly the Salve funct ions, thyrister TY2 being placed in series with the switchC . In the active position of the circuit, with the switch C closed, the motor is run at the first or at the second speed depending on whether the thyristor to be placed in conduction is TY2 or TY3.It is apparent that when the switch CA is turned to the M position, the motor T is subjected to normal manual control. Modification to the circuits of a technical practical nature and uses which though different, adopt the same concepts, such as for example the closing and opening of folding roofs when it starts to rain, obviously fall within the framework of protection afforded to the invention as described above and claimed hereinafter.
