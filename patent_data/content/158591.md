# Apparatus for silo clean out.

## Abstract
An apparatus for cleaning out material which remains within a confined space, such as silos, hoppers and the like, is disclosed. The apparatus includes a power driven device for impacting the material which is hung up within the silo to loosen it and allow it to fall downwardly of the silo. The device for impacting the material is suspended from and powered by a cable hose which is reeled onto a drum supported above the material in the silo. The drum is rotatable to payout or rewind the cable hose in positioning the impacting device in the area of the material to be loosened. The apparatus includes provision for automatical ly reciprocating the impacting device along the material face and in the event of a material avalanche, releasing the drum to allow the impacting device to fall downwardly with the flowing material.
