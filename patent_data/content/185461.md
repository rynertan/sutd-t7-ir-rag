# Shackle mechanisms, especially for handcuffs.

## Abstract
An arrest handcuff has the usual ratchet and pawl mechanism for closing the wrist aperture. In order to deadlock the pawl 10 a runner 16 is shifted by means of a manual push button 22 extending from the back face of the runner so that a stump 19 on the runner then overlies the nose 23 of the pawl. To release the deadlocking and pivot the pawl clear of the ratchet the runner 16 must be shifted to the left, which movement is normally blocked by a lever pack 25 operating on the runner stump 21 . A correct key, however, can lift the levers and turn the runner back. If the option to deadlock the pawl is not taken up in any particular arrest situation the pawl still remains engaged with the ratchet under its spring bias 13 and the correct key is still needed to perform a leftward movement of the runner to lift the pawl from the ratchet.
