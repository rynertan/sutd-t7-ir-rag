# ANTIGEN DETECTION RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS

## Abstract
An antigen associated with the pathogenesis of rheuma toid arthritis is detected in vitro in an essentially untreated human bodily fluid by a method which includes the steps of a obtaining the antigen in a purified form b obtaining a readily detectable anti immunoglobulin factor which shows no cross reaction with the antigen c treating the antigen with the bodily fluid so that antibodies for the antigen which are present in the fluid will complex with the antigen, and d treating the treated antigen with the readily detect able anti immunoglobulin factor so that the anti immunoglobulin factor binds only to complexed antibodies, whereby the presence of bound anti immunoglobulin factor and hence of complexed antibodies can be detected. The method can be performed using a kit which comprises a base surface having adsorbed thereupon a sample of the said antigen, and a readily detectable anti immunoglobulin factor. In particular, the method is suited for detection of an FC antigen.
