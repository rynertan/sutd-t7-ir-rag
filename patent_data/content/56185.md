# IMPROVEMENTS IN GAS SUSPENSION SYSTEMS FOR VEHICLES

## Abstract
A vehicle gas suspension system consits of a sus pension unit 21 , a high pressure reservoir 1 , a low pressure reservoir 2 and an electrically driven pump 3 . Control valves 18 and 22 are disposed in connec tion lines 19 and 23 between the unit 21 and the reservoirs 1 and 2 for respectively controlling the flow of gas to and from the suspension unit 21 so as to maintain the ride height of the vehicle at a suitably adjusted attitude irrespective of vehicle loading. The pump comprises a tubular barrel 9 , a valve at one end of the barrel 9 , and a piston 7 and flexible seal 8 which reciprocate in the barrel 9 reservoirs 1 and 2 . A vacuum relief valve 25 in the wall of the low pres sure reservoir 2 allows air to be drawn into the reser voir 2 from the atmosphere, and a dump valve 28 opens to allow gas to flow from the high pressure re servoir 1 to the low pressure reservoir 2 when a maximum permitted pressure is reached in the high pressure reservoir 1 .
