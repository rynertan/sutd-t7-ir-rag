## Description
HIGH EFFICIENCY CATALYST AND PROCESS FOR POLYMERIZING OLEFINS This invention relates to a new catalyst composition useful for initiating and promoting polymerization of a olefins and to a polymerization process employing such a catalyst composition. The present invention provides a catalytic reaction product of A a complex of a trivalent titanium compound with an electron donor, B an organomagnesium component selected from 1 an organomagnesium compound or 2 a complex of an organomagnesium compound and an organometallic compound in an amount sufficient to solubilize the organomagnesium compound in hydrocarbon and C a halide source selected from 1 an active non metallic halide, said non metallic halide corresponding to the formula R X wherein R is hydrogen or an organic group at least as active as sec butyl and X is halogen or 2 a metallic halide corresponding to the formula MR X wherein M is y a a a metal of Group 3a or 4a of Mendeleev s Periodic Table ofElements, R is a monovalent organic radical, X is halogen, y is a number corresponding to the valence of M and a is a number from 1 to y provided that the proportions o f the foregoing components of said catalytic reaction product being such that the atomic ratio of Mg Ti is from 1 1 to 2000 1, the atomic ratio of Al Ti is from 0.1 1 to 2000 1 and the atomic ratio of Mg X is from 0.01 1 to 1 1. The invention also provides a process for polymerizing at least one a olefin under conditions characteristic of Ziegler polymerization wherein the aforementioned reaction product is preferably employed as the sole catalyst. Olefin polymers produced in accordance with the process of this invention contain low amounts of catalyst residues and tend to be highly uniform. The invention is most advantageously practiced in a polymerization process wherein an a olefin is polymerized, generally in the presence of hydrogen as a molecular weight control agent, in a polymerization zone containing an inert diluent and the catalytic reaction product. Especially advantageous is the copolymerization of ethylene with higher a olefins using the catalytic reaction product of this invention. The polymerization process is most beneficially carried out under inert atmosphere and relatively low temperature and pressure, although very high pressures are optionally employed. Olefins which are suitably homopolymerized or copolymerized in the practice of this invention are generally the aliphatic a monoolefins or a diolefins having from 2 to 18 carbon atoms. Such a olefins include, for example, ethylene, propylene, butene l, pentene l, 3 methylbutene l, hexene l, octene l, dodecene l, octadecene l, butadiene, isoprene and 1,7 octadiene. The olefins may be copolymerized with other a olefins and or with small amounts, i.e., up to 25 weight percent based on the polymer, of other ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as styrene, a methylstyrene and similar ethylenically unsaturated monomers which do not destroy conventional Ziegler catalysts.Most benefits are realized in the polymerization of aliphatic a monoolefins, particularly ethylene and mixtures of ethylene and up to 50, especially from 0.5 to 40, weight percent of propylene, butene l, 1,7 octadiene or similar higher a olefin, based on total monomer. Electron donating compounds suitably employed include, for example, aliphatic alcohols, e.g., isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, n propyl alcohol, butanol and others having from 2 to 10 carbon atoms ethers having 2 to 20 carbon atoms, ketones having 3 to 20 carbon atoms amines having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms aldehydes or olefins having 2 to 20 carbon atoms and water. Preferably, the trivalent titanium complex is represented by the empirical formula TiZ3 L wherein Z is halide, and L is an electron donating compound such as water or an organic electron donor, e.g., alcohol, ether ketone, amine or olefin, and x is a whole number from 1 to 6. Usually, the organic electron donor has from 1 to 12 carbon atoms and donates an unshared pair of electrons to the complex. In the most preferred complexes, Z is chloride or bromide, most preferably chloride and L is alcohol, especially an aliphatic alcohol having 2 to 8 carbon atoms and most preferably 3 to 6 carbon atoms such as isopropyl alcohol, n propyl alcohol, n butyl alcohol and isobutyl alcohol.While the exact structure of the complex is not known, it is believed to contain 3 valence bonds to the halide ions and 1 to 6, preferably 2 to 4 coordination bonds to the electron donating compound. The titanium halide complex is most advantageously prepared by heating the trivalent titanium halide dispersed in the electron donating compound under nitrogen or similar inert atmosphere. Usually the formation of the complex is visually indicated by a definite change in color. For example, when the dark purple a TiC13 is heated in anhydrous isopropyl alcohol under nitrogen, complex formation is indicated by the formation of a brilliant blue solution.In preferred complexes, the complex is normally solid. In addition to an a TiCl3, the A, y and S crystalline forms of titanium trichloride are advantageously employed in the preparation of the complex. Also suitable are, for example, titanium tribromide and titanium fluoride.Of the foregoing, the y and a forms of titanium trichloride are preferred. The preferred organomagnesium component is a hydrocarbon soluble complex illustrated by the formula MgRµ 2 S y wherein R is hydrocarbyl, M is aluminum, zinc y or mixtures thereof and x is 0.001 to 10, especially from 0.15 to 2.5 and y denotes the number of hydrocarbyl groups which corresponds to the valence of M. As used herein, hydrocarbyl is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical. Preferably, hydrocarbyl is alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkenyl and similar hydrocarbon radicals having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, with alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms being especially preferred. This complex is prepared by reacting particulate magnesium such as magnesium turnings, or magnesium particles with about a stoichiometric amount of hydrocarbyl halide, illustrated as R X.The resulting hydrocarbon insoluble MgR 2 is solubilized by adding the organometallic compound such as A1R 3 or mixtures thereof with ZnRM2. The amount of organometallic compounds which is added to the MgR 2 to form the organomagnesium complex should be enough to solubilize a significant amount of MgR 2, e.g., at least 5 weight percent of MgR 2 is solubilized. It is preferred to solubilize at least 50 weight percent of theMgR 2 and especially preferred to solubilize all of MaR 2. When employing a mixture of AIR 3 and ZnR 2 to solubilize MgR 2, the atomic ratio of Zn to Al is from 3000 1 to 0.1 1, preferably from 350 1 to 1 1. In order to obtain maximum catalyst efficiency at polymerization temperatures above 1800C, it is desirable to minimize the amount of aluminum in the complex as well as in the total catalyst. Accordingly, for catalysts having Al Ti atomic ratios less than 120 1, it is desirable to have a Mg A1 atomic ratio more than 0.3 1, preferably from 0.5 1 to 10 1.In suitable complexes, organometallic compounds other than A1R ZnR 2 or mixtures thereof which also solubilize the organomagnesium compound in hydrocarbon are employed in beneficial amounts, usually an amount sufficient to produce at atomic ratio of 0.01 1 to 10 1 of metal of the organometallic compounds to magnesium. Examples of such other organometallic compounds include boron trialkyls such as boron triethyl, alkyl silanes such as dimethyl silane and tetraethyl silane, alkyl tin and alkyl phosphorous compounds. Alternative to the aforementioned solubilized magnesium complexes, it is also advantageous to employ organomagnesium compounds as the organomagnesium component.Such compounds, although often insoluble in hydrocarbon, are suitably employed. These compounds can be rendered soluble in hydrocarbon by addition of ether, amine, etc., although such solubilizing agents often reduce the activity of the catalyst. Recently, such compounds have been made hydrocarbon soluble without using such catalyst poisons, e.g., as taught in U.S. Patent 3,646,231. The more recent hydrocarbon solubilized organomagnesium compounds are the most desirable if an organomagnesium compound is to be used as the organomagnesium component. Preferably the organomagnesium compound is a dihydrocarbylmagnesium such as the magnesium dialkyls and the magnesium diaryls. Exemplary suitable magnesium dialkyls include dibutylmagnesium particularly di n butyl magnesium and n butyl sec butyl magnesium, dipropylmagnesium, diethylmagnesium, dihexylmagnesium, propylbutylmagnesium and others wherein alkyl has from 1 to 20 carbon atoms.Exemplary suitable magnesium diaryls include diphenylmagnesium, dibenzylmagnesium, and ditolylmagnesium, with the dialkylmagnesiums such as dibutylmagnesium, being especially preferred. Suitable organomagnesium compounds include alkyl and aryl magnesium alkoxides and aryloxides and aryl and alkyl magnesium halides with the halogen free organomagnesium compounds being more desirable. The preferred halide sources are the active non metallic halides of the formula set forth hereinbefore including hydrogen halides and active organic halides such as t alkyl halides, allyl halides, benzyl halides and other active hydrocarbyl halides wherein hydrocarbyl is as defined hereinbefore. By an active organic halide is meant a hydrocarbyl halide that contains a labile halogen at least as active, i.e., as easily lost to another compound, as the halogen of sec butyl chloride and preferably as active as t butyl chloride. In addition to the organic monohalides, it is understood that organic dihalides, trihalides and other polyhalides that are active as defined hereinbefore are also suitably employed.Preferred active non metallic halides include, for example, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, t butyl chloride, t amyl bromide, allyl chloride, benzyl chloride, crotyl chloride, methylvinyl carbinyl chloride, a phenylethyl bromide and diphenyl methyl chloride. Most preferred are hydrogen chloride, t butyl chloride, allyl chloride and benzyl chloride. Suitable metallic halides as set forth by formula hereinbefore are organometallic halides and metal halides wherein the metal is in Group 3a or 4a of Mendeleev sPeriodic Table of Elements. Preferred metallic halides are aluminum halides of the formula Aln 3aX a wherein R is hydrocarbyl such as alkyl, X is halogen and a is a number from 1 to 3. More preferred are alkylaluminum halides such as ethylaluminum sesquichioride, diethylaluminum chloride, ethylaluminum dichloride, and diethylalmninum bromide, with ethylaluminum dichloride being especially preferred. Alternatively, a metal halide such as aluminum trichloride or a combination of aluminum trichloride with an alkyl aluminum halide or a trialkyl aluminum compound may be suitably employed. The organic moieties of the organomagnesium, e.g., R , and the organic moieties of the halide source, e.g., R and R , are suitably any other organic radical provided that they do not contain functional groups that poison conventional Ziegler catalysts. Preferably such organic moieties do not contain active hydrogen, i.e., those sufficiently active to react with the Zerewitinoff reagent. In order to maximize catalyst efficiency, the catalyst is prepared by mixing the components of the catalyst in an inert liquid diluent in the following especially preferred order organomagnesium, titanium complex and halide source. Somewhat less preferred is the order of addition wherein the organomagnesium component is first added to an inert liquid diluent followed by the addition of the halide source and then the titanium complex.Suitable, but least preferred, is the order of addition wherein 1 the halide source is first combined with the titanium complex and then with the organomagnesium or 2 all three components are added and mixed simultaneously.The foregoing catalyst components are combined in proportions sufficient to provide an atomic ratio of Mg Ti in the range from 1 1 to 2000 1, preferably from 10 1 to 100 1, most preferably from 20 1 to 80 1 an atomic ratio of Mg X in the range from 0.01 1 to 1 1, preferably from 0.2 1 to 0.7 1, most preferably from 0.4 1 to 0.6 1. In cases wherein neither the organomagnesium component nor the halide source contains aluminum, it is desirable to include in the total catalyst an aluminum compound such as an alkyl aluminum compound, e.g., a trialkyl aluminum, an alkyl aluminum halide or an aluminum halide.If polymerization temperatures below 1800C are employed, the atomic ratio of Al Ti may be from 0.1 1 to 2000 1, preferably 1 1 to 200 1. However, when polymerization tenperatures above 1800C are employed, the aluminum compound is used in proportions such that the Mg A1 ratio is more than 0.3 1, preferably from 0.5 1 to 10 1, and Al Ti ratio is less than 120 1, preferably less than 75 1. The use of very low amounts of aluminum, however, necessitates the use of high purity solvents or diluents in the polymerization zone.Further, other components present in the zone should be essentially free of impurities which react with aluminum alkyls. Otherwise additional organo aluminum must be used to react with such impurities. Moreover, in the catalyst the aluminum compound should be in the form of trialkyl aluminum or alkyl aluminum halide provided that the alkyl aluminum halide be substantially free of alkyl aluminum halide. The foregoing catalytic reaction products are preferably carried out in the presence of an inert diluent.The concentrations of catalyst components are preferably such that when the three essential components of the catalytic reaction product are combined, the resultant slurry is from 0.005 to 0.1 molar moles liter with respect to magnesium. Suitable inert organic diluents include, for example, liquefied ethane, propane, isobutane, n butane, n hexane, the various isomeric hexanes, isooctane, paraffinic mixtures of alkanes having from 8 to 9 carbon atoms, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, dimethylcyclohexane, dodecane, industrial solvents composed of saturated or aromatic hydrocarbons such as kerosene, naphthas, etc., especially when freed of any olefin compounds and other impurities, and especially those having boiling points in the range from 500 to 2000C.Also included as suitable inert diluents are, for example, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, cumene and decalin. Mixing of the catalyst components to Provide the desired catalytic reaction product is advantageously carried out under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, argon or other inert gas at temperatures in the range from 100 to 2000C, preferably from 0 to 1000C. The period of mixing is not considered to be critical as it is found that a sufficient catalyst composition most often occurs within about 1 minute or less. In the preparation of the catalytic reaction product, it is not necessary to separate hydrocarbon soluble components from hydrocarbon insoluble components of the reaction product. Polymerization is effected by adding a catalytic amount of the catalyst composition to a polymerization zone containing olefin monomer, or vice versa. The polymerization zone is maintained at temperatures in the range from o to 3000C, preferably at solution polymerization temperatures, e.g., from 1300 to 2500C for a residence time of about a minute to several days, preferably 1S minutes to 2 hours.It is generally desirable to carry out the polymerization in the absence of moisture and oxygen and a catalytic amount of the catalytic reaction product is generally within the range from 0.0001 to 0.1 millimoles titanium per liter of diluent. The most advantageous catalyst concentration will depend upon polymerization conditions such as temperature, pressure, solvent and presence of catalyst poisons and the foregoing range is given to obtain maximum catalyst yields in weight of polymer per unit weight of titanium. In the polymerization process, a carrier, which may be an inert organic diluent or solvent or excess monomer, is generally employed. In order to realize the full benefit of the high efficiency catalyst of the present invention, care must be taken to avoid over saturation of the solvent with polymer.If such saturation occurs before the catalyst becomes depleted, the full efficiency of the catalyst is not realized. For best results, it is preferred that the amount of polymer in the carrier not exceed 50 weight percent based on the total weight of the reaction mixture. The polymerization pressures preferably employed are relatively low, e.g., from 50 to 1000 psig 3.5 to 70 kg sq. cm gauge , especially from 100 to 600 psig 7 to 42 kg sq. cm gauge . However, polymerization within the scope of the present invention can occur at pressures from atmospheric up to pressures determined by the capabilities of the polymerization equipment.During polymerization it is desirable to stir the polymerization recipe to obtain better temperature control and to maintain uniform polymerization mixtures and throughout the polymerization zone. In order to optimize yields in the polymerization of ethylene, it is preferable to maintain an ethylene concentration in the solvent in the range from 1 to 10 weight percent, most advantageously 1.2 to 2 weight percent. To achieve this when an excess of ethylene is fed into the system, a portion of the ethylene can be vented. Hydrogen is often employed in the practice of this invention to lower molecular weight of the resultant polymer. It is beneficial to employ hydrogen in concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 1 mole per mole of monomer.The larger amounts of hydrogen within this range are found to produce generally lower molecular weight polymers.Hydrogen can be added with a monomer stream to the polymerization vessel or separately added to the vessel before, during or after addition of the monomer to the polymerization vessel, but during or before the addition of the catalyst. The monomer or mixture of monomers is contacted with the catalytic reaction product in any conventional manner, preferably by bringing the catalytic reaction product and monomer together with intimate agitation provided by suitable stirring or other means. Agitation can be continued during polymerization, or in some instances, the polymerization can be allowed to remain unstirred while polymerization takes place. In the case OL more rapid reactions with more active catalysts, means can be provided for refluxing monomer and solvent, if any of the latter is present and thus remove the heat of reaction.In any event, adequate means should be provided for dissipating the exothermic heat of polymerization. If desired, the monomer can be brought in the vapor phase into contact with the catalytic reaction product, in the presence or absence of liquid material. The polymerization can be effected in the batch manner, or in a continuous manner, such as, for example, by passing the reaction mixture through an elongated reaction tube which is contacted externally with suitable cooling medium to maintain the desired reaction temperature, or by passing the reaction mixture through an equilibrium overflow reactor or a series of the same. The polymer is readily recovered from the polymerization mixture by driving off unreacted monomer and solvent, if any is employed. No further removal of impuri ties is required. Thus, a significant advantage of the present invention is the elimination of the catalyst residue removal steps. In some instances, however, it may be desirable to add a small amount of a catalyst deactivating reagent of the types conventionally employed for deactivating Ziegler catalysts. The resultant polymer is found to contain insignificant amounts of catalyst residue and to possess a very narrow molecular weight distribution. The following examples further illustrate the invention. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. In the following examples, the catalyst preparations are carried out in the absence of oxygen or water in a nitrogen filled 120 ml serum bottle. The catalyst components are used as diluted solutions in either n heptane or Isopar a mixture of saturated isoparaffins having 8 to 9 carbon atoms . The polymerization reactions are carried out in a five liter stainless steel stirred batch reactor at 1500C unless otherwise stated.In such polymerization reactions two liters of dry oxygen free Isopar are added to the reactor and heated to 1500C. The reactor is vented to about 25 psig 1.75 kg sq. cm gauge and 15 to 20 psi 1.05 to 1.4 kg sq. cm of hydrogen is added for polymer molecular weight control. Then, 120 psi 8.4 kg sq. cm of ethylene is added to the reactor and the ethylene pressure is set to maintain the reactor pressure at 160 psig 11.2 kg sq. cm gauge . The catalyst is then pressured into the reactor using nitrogen and the reactor temperature is maintained for the desired polymerization time. The polymerization reactor contents are dumped into a stainless steel beaker and allowed to cool. The resulting slurry is filtered and the polymer dried and weighed. The ethylene consumption during polymerization is recorded with a DP cell which shows the rate of polymerization and the amount of polymer produced. Catalyst efficiencies are reported as grams of polyethylene per gram of titanium, g.PE g.Ti.Example 1 A catalyst is prepared by adding with stirring 0.43 ml of 0.688 M di n butyl magnesium.l 6 triethylaluminum in Isopar E to 48.5 mo of E . To this solution is added 0.66 ml of titanium complex which is 0.0076 M based on Ti in Isopar E This complex is prepared by heating 20 g of a TiC13 in 800 ml of isopropanol to a temperature of 80 C until a brilliant blue solution is formed. To the resultant slurry are added 0.41 ml of 0.92 M ethylaluminum dichloride in cyclohexane. A 10 ml aliquot 0.0010 mmoles Ti of the resulting reaction product is added to the polymerization reactor. After 37 minutes, 248 grams of linear polyethylene is formed to give a catalyst efficiency of 5.7 x 106 g.PE g.Ti.Example 2 A catalyst is prepared by adding 81.61 ml ofIsopar Ear, and 1.49 ml of 0.516 M di n butyl magnesium.2 triethylaluminum in Isopar A to a serium bottle. To the resultant solution is added, in order, 1.9 ml of a slurry of the titanium complex described in Example 1 which is 0.0081 M with respect to Ti in Isopar E and 15 ml of 0.113 M HC1 in Isopar . Ten milliliters of this catalyst 0.0015 mmoles Ti is added to the polymerization reactor and after 30 minutes the reactor contents are collected. The yield of polymer is 158 grams indicating a catalyst efficiency of 2.2 x 106 g.PE g.Ti.Example 3 Following the general operating procedure described hereinbefore, several catalysts are prepared and polymerization runs are made. Unless otherwise indicated, the total catalyst concentration in the polymerization reactor is 0.001 millimolar based on Ti and the polymerization temperature is 1500C.

As the octadiene is increased from 0.1 to 20.0 ml in 2 liters of solvent, the catalyst efficiency decreases from 2.32 x 106 to 0.38 x 106 g of polymer per g of Ti.Also as the octadiene is increased, the molecular weight distribution of the polymer is broadened and the environmental stress crack resistance of the polymer is improved.Example 5 Again using a catalyst prepared in accordance with Example 1, a polymerization run is carried out in accordance with the general operating procedure except that 45 g of butene l is employed in 2 liters of IsoparThe catalyst a portion corresponding to 0.0045 mmole ofTi is added to the reaction vessel and after 33 minutes 303 g of polymer is obtained indicating a catalyst efficiency of 1.4 x 106 g of polymer per g of Ti. The polymer has a very narrow molecular weight distribution and a low peak molecular weight. I the polymerization temperature is lowered to 800C, a polymer having a broader molecular weight distribution and higher molecular weight is obtained with the recovered polymer exhibiting rubbery characteristics. Example 6 Using a catalyst prepared as in Example 1, a polymerization run is carried out in accordance with the general operating procedure except that 100 psig 7 kg sq.cm gauge of propylene is introduced into the reactor followed by an introduction of 200 psig 14 kg sq. cm gauge of ethylene and polynerization is effected at 750C. After 50 minutes, 188 g of rubbery ethylene propylene copolymer is obtained indicating a catalyst efficiency of 0.44 x 106 g of copolymer per g of Ti. If the propylene pressure is reduced to 120 psig 8.4 kg sq. cm gauge , the ethylene pressure is reduced to 162 psig 11.34 kg sq. cm gauge and polymerization carried out at 1000C, the catalyst efficiency is 0.47 x 106 g of copolymer per g of Ti and the resulting copolymer is very tough and has good clarity.
