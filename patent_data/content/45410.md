# Process for fabricating stable holograms.

## Abstract
An improved method for fabricating a light weight dichromated gelatin hologram package on plastic or glass substrates is provided. The prior art cover plate protecting the gelatin layer is eliminated by depositing on the gelatin a material providing a barrier to atmospheric moisture and possessing abrasion resistant properties. In one embodi ment, the photosensitive gelatin layer is deposited on a plastic substrate employing at least one subbing layer which provides a barrier to atmospheric moisture. Protection of the gelatin layer is provided by a plasma deposited silicon nitride film thereon.
