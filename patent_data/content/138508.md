## Description
This invention relates to a process for the transformation of Major emphasis in molecular cloning has been directed to prokaryotes, particularly In view of the cited difficulties, In recognition of the above mentioned difficulties with prokaryotes as host organisms, attention shifted to eukaryotes, and specifically yeasts, as host organisms. Yeasts of industrial importance, are non toxic and can be grown to very high densities. Some species are well analyzed genetically and some species can secrete proteins. The first transformation of a yeast, Hinnen Sjostak Orr Weaver A highly efficient system for transformation of There has now been found a process for the transformation of The novel plasmids or vectors, the terms are used interchangeably herein described in this application have several characteristics in common a bacterial replicon which permits their amplification in In general, for purposes of this invention, the production of useful vectors is based upon preparation of hybrid vectors i.e., vectors which function physiologically in a heterologous microorganism i.e., any species other than As those skilled in the art will recognize, the formation of vectors containing more than one gene of yeast origin increases the likelihood of forming, from said vectors, integrants i.e., transformants comprising said vectors, and especially of integrants having more than one gene. The presence of multiple genes, of course, increases and improves the ability to detect the presence of the vector in a yeast. Integration is achieved with circular, linear and gapped linear forms of said vectors. Linear and gapped linear vectors integrate with higher efficiency than do circular vectors. The vectors desirably, therefore, have a unique restriction site i.e., a site not present in the original microbial DNA vector or elsewhere in the The value of the vectors of this invention is based upon the presence therein of a selectable genetic marker, detectable in and functional in It is generally preferred to employ a Also valuable for the preparation of vectors useful in this invention are fragments of Using the novel vectors described herein, random segments of In general a bacterial, e.g. The herein described plasmids are useful as vectors in recombinant DNA methodology. Various genes can be inserted into them by, for example, cleaving them with a suitable restriction endonuclease to provide linear DNA having ligatable termini followed by reacting said linear DNA with an exogenous gene having ligatable termini. The resulting plasmids are then transformed into a suitable host microorganism, e.g. yeasts such as Additionally, the herein described plasmids afford means for improving fermentation characteristics of microorganisms, especially of The vectors, e.g. plasmids or cosmids, needed for this purpose can be constructed by techniques familiar to those skilled in the art of recombinant DNA technology. The Plasmid pLD25 replicates autonomously in Plasmids pLD21 and pLD23 described below, each of which carries the Plasmid pLD25 contains a fragment of Plasmid pLD28 also replicates autonomously in Plasmids pLD25 and pLD28 are shuttle vectors for Plasmid pLD40, described below, was constructed by inserting into the EcoR1 site of pBR322 a small segment containing the Plasmid pLD25 contains selectable genetic markers for Plasmid pLD40, also a subclone of pLD25, was constructed by insertion of the 2.3 or 2.4kb EcoRI partial digest fragment from pLD25 into the EcoRI site of pBR322.

The taxonomic study of CBS 599, the type culture for the species Since strain PC 30827 requires leucine and uracil J. R. DeZeeuw , both leucine ethyl ester and uracil at concentrations of 149 mg L and 20 mg L, respectively, were added to the following defined media basal medium for assimilation of carbon compounds, the broth for assimilation of potassium nitrate, the vitamin free broth for growth and the broth for testing the effect of vitamins on growth stimulation. Leucine ethyl ester as compared to leucine is slowly utilized as a carbon source. The other media were organic in nature and should support growth without the supplements. In strain CBS 599 the above mentioned defined media with and without the supplements were also used. As shown in the descriptions which follow, the cultures shared most of the cultural and morphological characteristics in common. A few differences were noticed. For example, the streak culture of strain CBS 599 on glucose yeast extract peptone agar was slightly roughened or slightly wrinkled, that of strain PC 30827 finely wrinkled. Strain PC 30827 showed poor growth on corn meal agar and produced less true mycelium when compared with strain CBS 599. In strain CBS 599, the results in which the defined media were supplemented with leucine ethyl ester and uracil were the same as those without the supplements except that citric acid was utilized without the supplements but not in the medium with the supplements. This indicates that the supplements were not used as either carbon or nitrogen sources thus their addition to the defined media for strain PC 30827 is acceptable. Compared with strain CBS 599, strain PC 30827 showed no to weak rather than good growth on succinic acid, D glucitol, and glycerol no rather than weak growth on vitamin free medium and salicin no to weak rather than good growth on thiamine for growth stimulation. Strain PC 30827 failed to grow on L sorbose whereas the reverse was true for strain CBS 599. The several differences in biochemical tests between strain PC 30827 and CBS 599 were quantitative in nature. The mutant strain PC 30827 shared most of the biochemical tests in common with the type culture CBS 599. when the results were used in a key to the species of Insertion of pLD25 into each of Chromosomal DNA from The novel plasmid pLD25 of this invention was constructed by ligation of linearized pBR322 with a partial Sau3A digest of The second component of pLD25 is obtained by subjecting the chromosomal DNA of The size of the DNA fragments is not critical to the process of this invention. The critical aspect as regards said DNA fragments is that they contain all or a sufficient part of the detectable marker, e.g. the The vector DNA and the partial Sau3A digest of The ligation mixture is first transformed into Plasmid minipreparations made from the rare leucine prototrophic transformants and analyzed by digestion with HindIII and SalI are found to contain the expected 3.7 kb fragment from pBR322 and 2 large fragments indicating an insert size of approximately 6.6 kb. Additionally, a small fragment from the SalI site of pBR322 to the nearer SalI site of the insert see Figure 3 was found. Comparison of Southern blot hybridizations Southern, J. Mol. Biol.

Yeast minimal medium, SD, contained 0.67 Bacto yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and 2 dextrose. Synthetic complete medium contained 870 mg l of powdered stock supplements made by grinding the following together in a mortar and pestle 2 g each of adenine sulfate, uracil, tryptophan, histidine HCl, arginine HCl and methionine, 3 g tyrosine, 6 g leucine, 5 g phenylalanine, 20 g threonine, 3 g lysine. For nutritional testing or selection, the appropriate ingredient was left out of complete medium. Forty eight ampicillin plates containing approximately 1.4 x 10⁴ Any A mixture of 2 ug each of pLD25 and YEp24 ATCC 37051 was incubated at 37 C with 6.25 units of SalI in 50 ul of SalI buffer for 1.5 hours. The digest was then extracted with an equal volume of phenol followed by three extractions with ether 1.5 ml. . The DNA was precipitated by addition of sufficient sodium chloride and absolute ethanol to give 0.1M sodium chloride and 70 ethanol concentration. The DNA was removed and dissolved in an equal volume of TE buffer. Ten µl of the DNA solution was then treated with T4 DNA ligase in 20 µl reaction volume for one hour at 14 C. Selection for the desired recombinant plasmid was carried out by transforming A partial EcoRI digest of pLD25 was carried out by treating approximately 25 micrograms of pLD25 with 20 units of restriction enzyme in 200 microliters and removing aliquots at 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 minutes. At each timepoint, 20 of the total volume was placed in gel sample buffer containing 33mM EDTA after dilution to stop the reaction. The timepoints were run on a gel and the desired band migrating slightly slower than the 2.3 kb lambda HindIII size standard was excised with a razor blade. The band was electroeluted in a dialysis bag and purified on a mini column Schleicher and Schuell Elutip D , as directed by the supplier. The vector used to clone the To test if other alleles of The first step comprised construction of a gene library of Sau3A partial digests of To obtain a high frequency of transformation and also to target the molecules in the library to integrate at the A 50 ml. culture of After 3 days a total of approximately 10,000 colonies grew on the leucine deficient media. The negative control plate done in parallel to the transformation experiment no DNA was used on these cells that were otherwise treated identically to the transformed cells contained no growing leucine independent colonies. The 36 transformation plates were replica plated to uracil deficient synthetic media. Only one colony that was uracil independent was found the next day. This colony was further processed to recover the A 50 ml. YPD culture of the first uracil independent transformant was grown overnight and harvested for DNA preparation using the phenol chloroform and protease method as described previously. Approximately 3 micrograms 7 of this chromosomal DNA preparation were digested to completion with the enzyme ApaI, followed by extractions with phenol, phenol chloroform and chloroform isoamyl alcohol and then ethanol precipitation. This DNA was ligated with T4 DNA ligase in a total volume of 80 microliters. Ten microliters of this reaction was used to transform 100 microliters of competent To verify that the plasmid did, in fact, contain the DNA was prepared from the A few micrograms of the DNA thus isolated was digested with the enzyme KpnI the same enzyme used to make the transformant , phenol extracted, purified on a Schleicher and Schuell Elutip D minicolumn following the manufacturer s directions and then ligated using T4 DNA ligase. Ligations at both medium more than 50 micrograms DNA per ml and low less than 10 micrograms ml concentrations were successful in the ensuing bacterial transformation.
