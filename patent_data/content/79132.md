# Process for the production of oxygenated hydrocarbons by the catalytic conversion of synthesis gas.

## Abstract
An oxygenated hydrocarbon product comprising metha nol and ethanol is produced by hydrogenating carbon monoxide at a temperature in the range 150 to 450 C and a pressure in the range 1 to 700 bars in the presence as catalyst of a supported mixture of the metals rhodium, silver, zirconium and molybdenum and optionally also one or more of the metals iron, manganese, rhenium, tungsten, ruthe nium, chromium, thorium and potassium. The preferred support is silica.
