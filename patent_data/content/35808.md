# Current measuring arrangement with overload protection.

## Abstract
A current measuring arrangement including a measuring resistor 4 can simply be protected against excess currents by means of a PTC resistor 16 and an amplifier circuit 11 . This protection is self restoring in contradistinction to the conven tional series connected safety fuse 3 . The amplifier circuit 11 , the PTC resistor 16 and the measuring resistor 4 may be arranged so that the property of zero voltage drop of a known circuit arrangement is maintained.
