# Water soluble glass compositions.

## Abstract
A water soluble glass has a dissolution rate that is distinctly pH sensitive, the ratio of dissolution rates between pH2 and pH6 being greater than 15 to 1. The glass incorporates phosphorus pentoxide as the glass former at a concentration not exceeding 48 mole , and an alkali metal oxide at a concentration rate exceeding 43 mole . The glass may be used in the fabrication of a tablet or bolus.
