# Dial and pointer electrical instrument.

## Abstract
In order to allow a wide range of instruments to be assembled from standard modules, there is provided a range of different diameter housings 10 with their glasses 11 spun in and sealed by an O ring 12. A housing can be trimmed to length as required. Different types of panel mountings can be fixed over the front rim of the housing 10. One of a range of standard movements 30 is mounted between plates 33 and 34 matched to the housing diameter and retained therein by releasable catches 40. The catches may be turnbuttons cooperating with pegs 23 projecting inside the housing. Alternatively, leaf spring catches slidable radially outwardly on the plate 34 can engage in an annular groove inside the housing 10 and be locked in position by clamp screws. The rear end of the housing 10 is plugged by an O ring sealed base which carries either a terminal part connector structure only or also a range scaling circuit enabling the same movement to handle different input signal ranges. The pointer 37 on an offset arm 38 sweeps over a scale 35, 36 which can be hub lit. For small instruments where cylindrical space available radially inside the arm 38 is small, bulbs are mounted in a radially offset position where the needle does not sweep of a transparent body to direct light radially inwardly to a 45 surface where internal reflection directs the light axially along a cylindrical lens part from which the light diffuses radially over the scale Alternatively, the 45 surface can be omitted by locating the bulbs close to the axis in a recess through which the bulbs can be withdrawn in the radial direction.
