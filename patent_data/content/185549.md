# Tracking control system for optical record disc information reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A tracking control system for an optical disc information reproducing apparatus in which information stored in an optical disc 16 as a series of recesses or pits arranged in concentric tracks or in a single spiral track is read out during rotation of the optical disc 16 by a scanning spot 18 of a light beam, the system comprising a light source 12 for generating the light beam used for scanning the track, means for applying the scanning spot 18 of the light beam to a selected track location, a transducer 26 , for converting an optical signal detected by the scanning spot into an electric signal bearing a tracking error information, means for controlling the scanning spot applying means in response to the tracking error information signal, thereby causing the scanning spot to scan the selected track location accurately, means for transferring the tracking error information signal to the contolling means, a transfer characteristics of the transferring means being variable, means for limiting a slew rate of the tracking error information signal, means for subtracting an output of the slew rate limiting means from the tracking error information signal, and means for lowering the transfer characteristics of the controlling means in response to an output of the subtracting means, thereby causing the controlling means being irresponsive to the tracking error information signal.
