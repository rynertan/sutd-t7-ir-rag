# Joint grouting tool.

## Abstract
A joint grouting tool has a mounting body 2 carried at the end of a handle 1, and incorporating a cavity which receives a grouting iron 9. The grouting iron 9 is fixed in place by a captive bolt 10. The tool is rolled over brickwork on wheels 4 carried on a shaft 3 so that the projecting portion of the grouting iron 9 enters a joint to compress and smooth grouting material therein. Excess material in the joint can be raked out as a preliminary step by using the tool in an inverted position so that the tip 14 of a raking tool 12 enters the joint in the brickwork.
