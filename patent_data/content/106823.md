## Abstract
A casting nozzle 1 at metallurgical processes, through which nozzle a metal bath is intended to flow out, where gas, such as argon or nitrogen gas or a mixture of gas and powderous material, is intended by means of an injection lance or the like to be injected into the bath in connection to the nozzle. The casting nozzle according to the invention is especial ly characterized, in that the through hole 2 of the nozzle 1 has substantially conic shape, with a cross sectional area increasing in the intended flow direction.
