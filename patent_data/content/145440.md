# Process of preparing a silver halide emulsion.

## Abstract
A silver halide emulsion combining the advantages of a strongly monodisperse character with a high silver iodide con tent can be prepared by mixing a water soluble silver salt solu tion with a water soluble halide solution in the presence of a protective colloid, and thereby forming silver halide grains con sisting essentially of silver iodobromide when a tetrazaindene compound is made present during formation of the silver ha lide grains.
