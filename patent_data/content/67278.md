# Externally coated hermetic seals for use with electrochemical cells.

## Abstract
An electrochemical cell system assembled in a closed housing in which said housing has a protruding terminal 36 electronically insulated from and hermetically sealed to said housing using a layer of insulating material e.g., glass or ceramic and wherein the exposed external interfacial areas 46, 48 of the insulating material 40 terminal 36 and the insulating material 40 cell housing, and preferably also the exposed external area of the insulating material 40 are coated with a layer of nonconductive, water resistant, pro tective material 50 e.g., wax or asphalt so as to prevent seal corrosion and electrolyte leakage from the cell when it is exposed to a high humidity environment.
