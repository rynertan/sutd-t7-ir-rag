# RATCHET WRENCH

## Abstract
A ratchet wrench incorporates a gear drive mechanism which includes a non driving interval in the reverse direc tion of rotation of the handle 60 of the wrench. Within that interval handle engagement with a toggle type switch 25, 26 can occur for reversing the ratcheting direction, this handle engagement of the ratcheting mechanism being by twisting the handle out of alignment with the mounting struc ture 22d of the handle. Non circular circumscribing inside wall surfaces 50a of a wedging device integral with the handle as viewed in tranverse cross section engage and wedge a roller 47a against the rounded surface of the drive shaft 15 . Thus, while the roller is wedged, reverse direc tion turning of the handle causes the drive shaft to turn to flip the toggle like switch mechanism, thereby reversing the ratcheting direction of the ratchet wrench.
