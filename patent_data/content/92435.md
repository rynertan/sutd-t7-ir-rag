## Description
A Method of, and a Susceptor for use in, Vapour Deposition of Films. This invention relates to the field of vapour deposition of films on substrates, and in particular, though not exclusively to the vapour deposition of epitaxial films, for example silicon and like films, on exposed surfaces of materials, such as silicon wafer substrates commonly used in the electronics industry. In known vapour deposition methods, gaseous chemical reactants are brought into contact with heated substrates in a reactor. Uniform heating of the substrates is required to obtain high quality films. The most common technique of heating is radio frequency RF induction heating of a conducting susceptor or wafer carrier positioned within the reaction chamber, which has walls of non conducting or insulating materials. It is well known to use RF heating of a graphite susceptor coated with silicon carbide SiC within a quartz reaction chamber for depositing epitaxial silicon films. It is very difficult to keep a susceptor at uniform temperature, throughout the process of raising and lowering the temperature. For example, during the temperature elevation, the high voltage side of the RF induction coil or the lower course of reactants stream may reach a specified temperature too quickly. Portions of the substrate wafer on the susceptor will be at different temperatures. Inequality of temperature causes crystal defects or slip and lack of uniform thickness. Such defects and lack of uniformity cause leakage current, low breakdown voltages, and poor yield of semiconductor devices. Referring to Figure 1, which illustrates a known method, substrate wafers 2 are placed on the flat surface of a susceptor 1.In this case, if portions of the susceptor are at different temperatures or the substrate wafer 2 is in non uniform contact with the susceptor, the substrate may also not be at a uniform temperature. U.S. Patent No. 3,594,227 shows rotating substrate holders having circular recesses which, it is stated, result in a very uniform thin film deposition.However, complicated mechanisms are required to rotate the susceptor assembly. On the other hand, Japanese patent publication 50 12971 shows a simple way of uniform heating.As shown in Figure 2, the susceptor body 3 has a concave surface 4 which gently slopes from the edge toward the centre. The substrate 5 is placed on the concaved surface 4. Heat conducts through the contact points of susceptor body 3 and substrate 5 and by radiation from the concave surface 4 to the back surface of substrate 5. Another prior art device is shown in Figure 3. In this device, the recess has a step 4 a to support the substrate 5 and heat is conducted through the contact surface of step 4 a and substrate 5 and radiated from the concave surface 4 to the back surface of substrate 5 . These prior art susceptors are simple and effective for a particular region of the substrate wafer. Nowadays larger substrate wafers are required to increase productivity and the prior art methods are then not sufficient. Accordingly, one aspect of the invention provides a method of depositing a film on a generally planar semiconductor wafer comprising the steps of supporting the semiconductor wafer in a recess on a susceptor, so that a major part of the wafer does not contact the susceptor, and is substantially parallel to and adjacent to a bottom surface of the recess placing the susceptor with the wafer in a reactor heating the wafer to a temperature suitable for epitaxial deposition and introducing gaseous reactants into reactor, so that deposition can take place. Accordingly, another aspect of the invention provides a susceptor for use in depositing a film on at least one semiconductor wafer supported on the susceptor, comprising a body portion at least one recess in an upper surface of the body portion, for receiving respectively the at least one semiconductor wafer a step in the recess for supporting the at least one wafer so that a major part of the wafer does not contact the body and is substantially parallel and adjacent to a bottom surface of the recess. This invention thus provides a method and susceptor for producing epitaxial films whereby a uniform temperature may be established and maintained over the major part of the surface area of the substrate wafers while it is treated with gases. A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings Figure 1 is a partly cutaway, perspective view of substrate wafers on a prior art susceptor Figure 2 is a sectional view of a prior art susceptor Figure 3 is a sectional view of another prior art susceptor Figure 4 is a sectional view of the preferred embodiment of this invention Figure 5 is a sectional view illustrating slip in the substrate wafer Figure 6 is a temperature profile across a wafer using the preferred embodiment Figure 7A is a view of half of the front surface of the processed wafer Figure 7B is a view of half of the back surface of the processed wafer Figure 8A is a graph of the distribution of total slip length of sample wafers produced by the preferred embodiment and Figure 8B is a graph of the distribution of total slip length of sample wafers produced by the Figure 3 prior art. Referring to Figure 4 and subsequent figures, a susceptor 10 has a recess 12 at the surface of susceptor body 11. It is to be understood that body 11 typically has a plurality of such recesses 12 over its surface, and such recesses can be differing shapes but preferably are circular. The recess 12 has a step 13 which supports the edge of wafer 15, and a bottom surface 14 which is parallel to the top surface of step 13. The upper part of the recess 12, about the step 13, has a diameter Z1 which is slightly larger than the diameter of wafer 15. The diameter Z2 of the lower part of the recess 12 measured from the inner edge of step 13 is slightly smaller than the diameter of wafer 15. Therefore, wafer 15 can be placed on and supported by the step 13 within the recess 12.The body 11 is advantageously made of graphite coated with silicon carbide SiC by the Chemical Vapour Deposition CVD method to a thickness of about 10 A14 The SiC coating prevents impurities from evolving from the material when it is heated from 1000 12500C during the epitaxial reaction. One reason that opening diameter Z1 is slightly larger than the diameter of wafer 15 is to facilitate the positioning of wafer 15 in the recess 12 and to facilitate its subsequent removal. A second reason is to prevent strain on the wafer 15 caused by expansion due to heating during the reaction process. Unless the recess is sufficiently larger than the wafer, such strain can occur. The size of the lower part of the recess 12, having diameter Z2 defined by the, inner edge of step 13, is chosen so that the edge of wafer 15 is supported, and so that preferably the upper edge portion of step 13 extends under wafer 15 for about 5t of the wafer s diameter. The depthX1 from the top surface of the body 11 to the upper surface of supporting step 13 is chosen to equal the thickness of wafer 15. This construction aliows smooth and even flow of the reactant gases, to ensure uniform contact with wafer 15 and prevent temperature loss from wafer 15. The depth X2 from the upper surface of supporting step 13 to the bottom or recess 14 depends primarily on the diameter of wafer 15 and to a less extent on the type of gaseous reactant. When the depth X2 is too large, the heat energy transmitted from susceptor 10 to wafer 15 is insufficient and it is impossible to raise the temperature of substrate wafer 15 uniformly or sufficiently. On the other hand, when the depth X2 is too small, it is difficult to keep the temperature uniform over the surface of wafer 15 thereby resulting in stress or crystal defect. The temperature of the process should be selected corresponding to the reactant gas, shown in Table 1 for example. Table 1 Reactant Gas Temperature SiC14 12000C SiHC13 11500C SiH 2Cl2 1l000C SiH4 10000C In operation, after putting the substrate wafer 15 on the supporting step 13 of susceptor 10, susceptor 10 is positioned in a conventional reactor. RF energy is applied to a coil surrounding the reactor and the susceptor 10 is heated. This heat energy is transmitted from the supporting step 13 of the susceptor to the edge portion of wafer 15, and from the bottom 14 of recess 12 to the back surface of wafer 15. The temperature of the edge portion of wafer 15 rises rapidly, and heat conduction occurs through the full thickness of the wafer and from the edge to the centre.Gaseous reactant is then introduced into the reactor. Using this embodiment of the present invention a uniform rise of temperature occurs over the whole wafer 15.As shown by the sectional view of Figure 5, any slip is restricted to the edge region of the wafer. Furthermore, heat stress by the heat rise of wafer 15 is absorbed in the edge region so the appearance of slip is eliminated other than in the edge portion. An example reaction arrangement will now be described wherein the dimensions of the susceptor recess are selected to be X1 650 a nearly equal to the thickness of substrate wafer X2 80 sxm Zl 102 mm diameter of wafer is 100 mm Z2 90 mm Gaseous reactants are SiC 4 and H2 Reaction formula is SiC 4 2H Si 4HC1 In actuality, the reaction is more complex.Depending upon reactant concentration, temperature, pressure and reactor geometry, various side reactions can also occur. The temperature distribution profile using an arrangement as suggested above is shown in Figure 6. That is, the susceptor is heated to 12300C, the edge wafer 15 contacting the susceptor is at 1210 C and the area of wafer 15 not touching the susceptor surface is at 118O0c , after a steady state is reached. Figure 7A shows half of the front top surface of wafer 15 after this epitaxial process. Slips are confined to the marginal area, in particular the area over that which was in contact with the susceptor 10. Figure 7B shows half of the back surface of wafer 15. A thin film of poly silicon occurs on the edge area which was in contact with the susceptor 10. It seems that the high temperature of this area causes growth of the thin film from the gaseous reactant which diffused to the back side of the wafer 15. However, the thickness of the film on the back side is 0.1 Am at most in the case of reactant being SiC 4 at temperature 1200 C, while the thickness of film on the front surface is 10 m. This thin film does not affect the subsequent processings of the wafer, for example, warp or slip does not occur in oxidation or diffusion process and shears in masking or poor contact are not affected during the photo engraving process. Table 2 shows the comparison with the prior art of the ratio of slip free area , which is defined as follows 1. Cover all slips in visual inspection by respective 2.5mmx2.5mm squares which is the typical size of a bi polarIC.2. Sum the area covered by square, as a .3. Size of all is A .4. Ratio of slip free area is 100 x A a A g Table 2 Ratio of Type of Susceptor Slip Free Area This embodiment 95 o 100 Flat surface 40 50 Fig. 1 Concaved surface ss0 o 70 Fig. 3 This table shows an effectiveness of this invention. Sirtl etching inspection, which is a well known examination technique for crystal defect, supports the effectiveness of this invention. Under a Sirtl etching inspection, the prior art shows worse results than the visual inspection shown in the above table, while the described embodiment keeps equal ratio to the visual inspection. Figures 8A and 8B show another interesting comparison with the prior art. They show the distribution of total slip length, which is defined as the sum total of each slip length of one substrate wafer, by visual inspection. Figure 8A shows the results of visually inspecting 24 samples made by this embodiment. Figure 8B shows the results produced by the prior art illustrated inFigure 3 for which 32 samples were inspected. A distribution pattern of the embodiment of this invention has a peak at low slip length. On the other hand, the prior art Figure 3 has a distribution pattern with a peak in the middle, and both peak and average values are higher than for a described embodiment. In summary, what has been disclosed is a novel method and susceptor for vapour deposition in general and for an epitaxial reaction which produces epitaxial material of high quality and excellent uniformity. In particular surface imperfections in the epitaxial film such as slip are substantially eliminated.
