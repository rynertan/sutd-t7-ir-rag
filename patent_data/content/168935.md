# Transport conveyor for conical objects.

## Abstract
A transport conveyor 1 for empty conical winding tubes includes a recirculating band system 3 to drive jammed tubes 2 for rotation in a direction causing them to roll along the chute of the conveyor 1 . Every alternate tube 2 is reversed by means of holding pin 6 and a rotating shoe 7 . A fin 8 upstanding from the conveyor floor supports all the tubes with their axes parallel.
