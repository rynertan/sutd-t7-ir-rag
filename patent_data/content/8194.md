# Ethynyl terminated epoxy resin derivatives and process for making the same.

## Abstract
Novel thermosetting oligomers are formed by reacting epoxy prepolymers with aminoarylacetylenes. When heated to 170 C or above, these oligomers undergo acetylenic po lymerization to form resins which exhibit superior thermal and hydrolytic stability when compared to conventionally cured epoxy resins.
