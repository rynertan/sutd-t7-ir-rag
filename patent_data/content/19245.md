# Device control system.

## Abstract
The disclosed control system employs the serving electronic stored program PBX 100 to regulate the operation of devices located at of sites in accordance with one or more modes of operation as offered by an algorithm stored in the PBX memory. Each site is equipped equipping each guest room or office with a control circuit EC00 to regulate the operation of the devices located in that room. These control circuits EC00 ECn are activated by the presence of an audio frequency on the telephone line T00, R00 associated with the site. To minimize the impact of this scheme on the traffic capacity of the PBX time division switching network, all activated control circuits are concurrently connected to a single time slot, which supplies the required audio frequency.
