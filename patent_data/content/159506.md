# Apparatus for band compression processing of a picture signal.

## Abstract
An apparatus for band compression processing of a picture signal which generates forecasting error signal block 3 and movement vector block 1 and updates only the movement vector during a comb out operation. During comb out processing, a picture signal is recirculated block 5 while the movement vector is produced and accumulated block 11 . At the end of the comb out processing, the change in the movement vector from the accumulated vec tor is within a desired range. Therefore, a scale of circuit does not increase for detecting the movement vector after the comb out operation.
