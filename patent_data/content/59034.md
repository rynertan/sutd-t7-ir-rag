## Description
A PROCESS FOR PRODUCING COPOLYMERS OF ETHYLENE WITH a OLEFINS The present invention relates to a process for copolymerizing ethylene with one or more a olefins or for copolymerizing ethylene, one or more a olefins and one or more polyenes. The term copolymerization , as used herein, means, except where the context otherwise requires, polymerization of three or more monomers, as well as the simple polymerization of two different monomers. The process of the invention produces aolefin copolymers having excellent processability and physical properties. Although many types of catalyst have been proposed for producing amorphous copolymers of olefins, the so called Ziegler catalysts are particularly effective.It is generally known that good results can be achieved using a Ziegler type catalyst comprising an organoaluminium compound and a vanadium compound, particularly a trivalent to pentavalent vanadium compound soluble in an inert organic solvent. However, most of the vanadium containing catalyst systems of this type, although exhibiting a very high activity in initial stages of the polymerization, exhibit a rapid drop in activity after a relatively short period of time and also have a low catalyst efficiency. In order to improve this low catalyst efficiency, many catalysts activators have been proposed. The most effective of these activators are generally considered to be the alkyl esters of trichloroacetic and tribromoacetic acids as described, for example, inJapanese Patent Publication No. 15052 68 , the ethylene glycol monoalkyl ether esters, particularly monoethyl ether esters e.g. those sold under the Trade Mark CELLOSOLVE of trichloroacetic acid or tribromoacetic acid e.g. as described in Japanese Patent ApplicationKokai i.e as laid open to public inspection No. 5288 78 and esters of perchl orocrotoni c acid e.g. as described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 9390 79 , since these improve catalyst efficiency considerably. These catalyst activators, however, when used in copolymerization, provide polymers having a narrower molecular weight distribution than that achieved using the ordinary catalyst systems comprising an organoaluminium compound and a vanadium compound. In addition, these tend to give rise to a decrease in green strength, an increase in creep and an ensuing increase in cold flow. Moreover, the use of these catalyst activators gives rise to serious operational difficulties, such as lowering of the processability of the resulting polymers when mixing, rolling, extruding etc. It is, therefore, important, when using these catalyst activators, to develop a technique to improve heat resistance, processability and mechanical strength of the resulting copolymers. Cold flow properties, green strength and roll processability of a polymer are physical properties intimately associated with the molecular weight distribution of the polymer, but it is not possible to control or improve processability simply by controlling the molecular weight distribution. We have now discovered a way of using catalyst activators of the type described above yet still produce a copolymer having excellent mechanical properties such as high creep resistance and lower cold flow and excellent processability. Accordingly, the present invention consists in a process for producing a copolymer of ethylene and an a olefin of formula CH2 CHR in which R represents a straight or branched chain C1 C6 alkyl group or of ethylene, said a olefin and a linear or cyclic di ene or higher polyene having non conjugated double bonds by polymerization in an inert organic solvent, characterized in that the polymerization is conducted in the presence of a an organoaluminium compound of formula R A1X 3 n in which R represents a C1 C20 hydrocarbon radical, X represents a halogen atom or an alkoxy group and n is a number such that 1 n 3, and b a trivalent to pentavalent vanadium compound soluble in an inert organic solvent, and c as catalyst activator, an ester of a halogenated organic acid, in two reactors connected in series while keeping the reactors at different temperature levels. By carrying out the process of the invention under the preferred conditions described in more detail hereafter, it is possible to produce copolymers, terpolymers and higher copolymers having excellent processability. The organoaluminium compounds to be used as one of the catalyst components in the process of the present invention are represented by the general formula R nAlX 3 n and include trialkylaluminiums, dialkylaluminium monohalides, alkylaluminium dihalides, alkylaluminium sesquihalides and dialkylaluminium monoalkoxides. Specific examples of such organoaluminium compounds include triethylaluminium, triisopropylalumini.um, triisobutylaluminium, trihexylaluminium, diethylaluminium chloride, diethylaluminium bromide, ethylaluminium dichloride, ethyl aluminium sesquichloride, diisobutylaluminium chloride, isobutylaluminium sesquichloride and isobutylalumnium dichloride. A single one of these compounds may be used or it is possible to use two or more thereof. The other catalyst component is a trivalent to pentavalent vanadium compound which is soluble in an inert organic solvent and such compounds include vanadium halides, vanadium oxyhalides, chelate complexes of vanadium with oxygen containing compounds and vanadic acid esters. Specific examples of such compounds include vanadium tetrachloride, vanadium oxytrichloride, vanadium trisacetylacetonate, vanadium oxytrisacetylacetonate, vanadic acid triethoxide, vanadic acid diethoxychloride, vanadium acid ethoxydichloride, vanadic acid tributoxide, vanadic acid dibutoxychl oride and vanadic acid butoxydi chloride. A single one of these compounds may be used or it is possible to use two or more of them. The catalyst activators used in the process of the invention are esters of halogenated organic acids, particularly alkyl trichloroacetates, alkyl tribromoacetates, esters of ethylene glycol monoalkyl particularly monoethyl ethers with trichloroacetic acid and alkyl perchlorocrotonates. Specific examples of these compounds include methyl trichloroacetate, ethyl trichloroacetate, methyl tribromoacetate, ethyl tribromoacetate, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether trichloroacetate, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether tribromoacetate, butyl perchlorocrotonate and methyl perchlorocrotonate. a Olefins which can be used in the process of the invention are represented by the general formulaCH2 CHR and include, for example, propylene, butene 1, pentene 1, hexene 1 and 4 methylpentene 1. Linear or cyclic non conjugated dienes or higher polyenes, which are an optional third component of the polymer include, for example, 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene, 5 methylene 2 norbornene, 1,4 hexadiene, 1,6 octadiene, dicyclopentadiene, cyclopentadiene, 5 isopropenyl 2norbornene and methyl tetrahydroindene. Of these compounds, particularly preferred are 1,4 hexadiene hereinafter referred to as 1,4 HD , dicyclopentadiene hereinafter referred to as DCPD and 5 ethylidene 2norbornene hereinafter referred to as ENB . The inert organic solvent which is used as a reaction solvent in the process of the invention is preferably a hydrocarbon or halogenated hydrocarbon, such compounds being well known for use in this type of reaction, and examples include hexane, heptane, kerosene, cyclohexane, benzene, chloroform, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethane and perchloroethylene. In order to produce copolymers having excellent processability in accordance with the process of the present invention, it is important to establish properly a number of process conditions, specifically polymerization temperatures in the two reactors which is, of course, an essential feature of the present invention amounts of polymers to be formed in the two reactors and the amount of molecular weight regulator used. The temperature difference between the first and second stage reactors in the process of the invention can vary over a wide range but, in order to achieve suitable control over the polymerization and production economy, we prefer that the difference should be within the range from 50C to 4O0C, preferably from 50C to 3O0C. In addition, most favourable results can be achieved by keeping the polymerization temperatures in the first and second stages at from 10 C to 60 C and at from 500C to 1O00C, more preferably from 25 C to 60 C and from 550into 8O0C, respectively. It is well known that this type of polymerization reaction is normally effected in the presence of a molecular weight regulator and likewise the process of the present invention is preferably effected in the presence of such a compound. The molecular weight regulator may be fed either into the first stage reactor only or into both the first and the second stage reactors, but the former is the more effective. Although it is not yet clear why copolymers having excellent processability are produced by keeping the polymerization temperatures in the first and second stages at different levels and preferably within the respective ranges mentioned above, and although we do not wish to be limited by any theory, it is thought that the copolymers produced in the first and second stages differ in their polymer structure and molecular weight, although the compositions of the copolymers, in terms of amounts and proportions of the monomer components, are the same. When the polymerization temperatures of the first and second stages are kept the same copolymers having the excellent processability of the present invention cannot be obtained and even when the temperatures are outside the preferred ranges, it is difficult to achieve such good copolymers. Although a polymerization temperature in the first stage higher than 6O0C will also give a copolymer having excellent processability, the catalyst efficiency drops considerably at the same time, thus giving rise to the disadvantage of higher catalyst cost. The ratio of the amount of copolymer produced in the first stage to that produced in the second stage can vary over a wide range, but the ratio is preferably within the range of from 3 1 to 1 3, more preferably from 2.5 1 to 1 2.5. Processability of copolymers, in general, can be somewhat improved by producing two copolymers having the same characteristic structural values i.e. content of a olefin constituents, iodine value and Mooney viscosity as the copolymer obtained by the process of this invention at two different polymerization temperatures for example at 400C and at 600C and blending together the two copolymers. This approach, however, gives rise to additional labour costs for blending and, in addition, is not so effective for improving processability as is the process of the invention. The catalyst activator c may be added in a variety of ways in the process of the invention. For example, it may be added by itself or in admixture with one or more of the catalyst components and it may be added all at once at the beginning of the polymerization process or continuously or discontinuously throughout the polymerization. The amount of catalyst activator to be used may vary over a wide range, but we prefer that it should not exceed an amount equimolar with respect to the organoaluminium compound. Accor dingy, the preferred molar ratio of organoaluminium compound to catalyst activator is from 100 1 to 2 1.The preferred molar ratio of catalyst activator to vanadium compound is from 1 0.1 to 1 100, more preferably from 1 1 to 1 30. As already noted, the process of the invention can be carried out in the presence of a molecular weight regulator to produce a copolymer of ethylene and an a olefin optionally with a polene compound having any particular desired molecular weight. Molecular weight regulators commonly used in this type of process are diethylamine, pyridine N oxide and hydrogen, of which hydrogen is especially preferred. The amount of molecular weight regulator to be used can easily be chosen based on principles well known to those skilled in the art, depending upon the desired molecular weight of the copolymer. The preferred polymerization pressure in the process of this invention is from 1 to 50 kg cm2, more preferably from 1 to 30 kg cm2. The process of the invention enables solution copolymerization to be carried out with ease in a conventional solvent in which the copolymer is soluble to produce a copolymer having an ethylene content as high as 90 mole . When the process of the invention is carried out under the preferred conditions described above, it is possible to produce ethylenela olefin copolymers and ethylene a olefin polyene terpolymers having low cold flow and high resistance to compression deformation as well as excellent processability during various conventional procedures such as mixing, rolling, extrusion and calendering. The invention is further illustrated by the following non limiting Examples. EXAMPLE 1 Continuous copolymerization was carried out in two 10 litre SUS autoclaves, each equipped with a stirrer and connected in series. To the bottom of the first stage reactor were continuously fed 4.5 kg hour of hexane, as the polymerization solvent 0.34 kg hour of ethylene, 1.36 kg hour of propylene and 30 gjhour of ENB, as monomers 0.01 mole of hydrogen, as molecular weight regulator and 1.3 g hour of ethylaluminium sesquichloride EASC , 0.13 g hour of vanadium trichloride and 0.65 g hour of butyl perchlorocrotonate BPCC . The temperature in this reactor was kept at 500C. The resulting polymer solution was then continuously fed to the second stage reactor, in which polymerization was conducted at 600C, whilst continuously feeding 2.3 kg hour of hexane, 0.14 kg hour of ethylene, 10 g hour of ENB, 0.8 g hour of EASC, 0.08 g hour of vanadium oxytrichloride and 0.4 g hour of NPCC. After adding polypropylene glycol of molecular weight about 2,000 as a polymerization stopping agent to the polymerization solution, the resulting copolymer was separated by steam stripping and then dried, giving the copolymer at the rate of 750 glhour. The copolymer had a propylene content of 43.7 weight , an iodine value of 8.5 and a Mooney viscosity my1 4 at 1210C of 66. The percentage. of compression deformation was very low at 5.1 and the processability when mixing and rolling was excellent. The percentage of compression deformation was determined by measuring the deformation of test pieces after allowing them to stand for 60 minutes at 500C under a load of 0.19 kg cm2 using a small heat distortion testing machine manufactured by Ueshima Seisakujo .The test pieces were pressed sheets having a diameter of 30 mm and a thickness of 10 mm, which were used for the test after being heated at 700C for 30 minutes.

The properties and processabilities of the copolymers produced were evaluated in the following ways Measurement of percentage compression deformation This was done as described in Example 1. The copolymers obtained in Examples 1 5 all have low percentages of compression deformation in other words low cold flow as compared with the copolymers obtained in Comparative Examples 1 5, thus indicating that the resistance to compression deformation is much improved by the process of this invention.Mixing processability The mixing processability of each copolymer was evaluated by measuring the folding endurance of a compound containing the polymer prepared by mixing in a BR type Banbury mixer, followed by vulcanization under the following conditions. The measured folding endurance was regarded as a measure of the uniformity of dispersion of the carbon black, which depends upon the mixing processability of the copolymer. Mixing conditions Percentage of volume of mixer filled 75 , front rotor with compound 57.5 back rotor 51.2 r.p.m. Mixing temperature 700C at start, 1500C at maximumMixing time 5 minutes, charged at a time Compounding formulation EPDM 100 parts by weightCarbon black Seast 3 60 parts by weightProcess oil Sonic R 1000 10 parts by weightZnO 5 parts by weightStearic acid 1 part by weightVulcanization acceleratorEMI18.1 tb Sokushinol SEP TS SEP SEP 1 SEP part SEP by SEP weight tb Sokushinol SEP M SEP SEP SEP mixed SEP by SEP 0.25 SEP part SEP by SEP weight tb SEP roll tb SEP milling tb Sulphur 1 part by weight Vulcanization Temperature 1600C Period Controlled so that the modulus values of test pieces might become identical. Measurement Measured at 300C in accordance with JIS K 6301. JIS means Japanese Industrial Standard . Comparison was made between the copolymer ofExample 3 and that of Comparative Example 2 and between the copolymers of Examples 4 and 5 and those of Comparative Examples 3, 4 and 5. The folding endurance values for Example 3 and for Comparative Example 2 were 670 and 420 folds respectively. Those for Example 4 and Comparative Examples 3, 4 and 5 were 2550, 1500, 1700 and 1550 folds, respectively. Those for Examples 2 and 5 and for ComparativeExamples 1 and 2 were 680, 660, 530 and 570 folds, respectively. From this it can be seen that the copolymers produced by the process of the invention have superior folding endurance. Since the better the dispersion of fillers such as carbon black , the higher is the folding endurance, the copolymers produced by the process of the invention have excellent mixing processability.Rolling processability The rolling processability of each copolymer was evaluated using a 8 inch 20.32 cm two roll mixing mill and observing the behaviour of sample stock as it wound round the rolls at a roll surface temperature of 50 C and with a gap of 2 mm between the rolls.The results are shown in the foregoing Table, in which the symbols employed for this evaluation are as follows 0 No. bagging of the stock was observed and the stock wound round the front roll A a little bagging was observed x severe bagging was served and the stock wound around the back roll. The same compounding formulation was used as in the evaluation of mixing processability.Extrusion processability This was evaluated by mixing each sample compound in a BR type Banbury mixer, extruding the resulting compounds through a 45 mm diameter extruder and anASTM Garvey dice, and then observing the surface appearance of the extrudates. The compounding formulation was the same as that used in the evaluation of mixing processability and the resu lts are reported in the foregoingTable using the following symbols o The extrudate had a smooth surface the extrudate had a slightly coarse surface x the extrudate had a markedly coarse surface. ,A comparison between the copolymers of Examples 1 and 2 and that of Comparative Example 2 showed that the surface of the extrudate of Comparative Example 2 was extremely coarse and that, whilst the extrudates of Examples 1 and 2 had somewhat coarse surfaces, these were much better than that of Comparative Example 2.Calenderinq processability This evaluation was effected by mixing each sample compound in a BR type Banbury mixer front rotor 57.5 back rotor 51.2 r.p.m. x 4 minutes , calendering the resulting compound through a four roll 8 inch 20.32 cm calender the surface temperatures of the rolls were 980C, 950C, 9O0C and 850C at a speed of 7 metres minute and observing the appearance of the resulting sheets.The results are reported in the foregoing Table using the following codes o The sheet had occluded no bubbles and had a smooth surface the sheet had occluded a small number of bubbles and had a slightly coarse surface x the sheet had occluded many bubbles and had a coarse surface. The compounding formulation used was parts by weight EPDM 100 Carbon black HAF 70 Inorganic filler 35 Softening agent Processing aid 14 Stearic acid 2.5 ZnO 5Accelerating agents Sokushinol BZ 1.5 Sokushinol TT 0.5 Sokushinol M 0.5 Sokushinol CZ 1.0 Sulphur 1.2 Comparing the copolymer of Example 4 with those of Comparative Examples 3 and 4, the calendered sheet of Example 4 had occluded no bubbles and had a smooth surface, whereas that of Comparative Example 3 had occluded a large number of bubbles and had a coarse surface whilst that of Comparative Example 4 had occluded a small number of bubbles and had a slightly coarse surface, thus indicating the superiority of the copolymer of Example 4 in calendering processability.
