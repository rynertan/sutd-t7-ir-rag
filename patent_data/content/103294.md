# N alkylindolylidene and N alkylbenzothiazolylidene alkanones as sensitizers for photopolymer compositions.

## Abstract
Photopolymerizable compositions comprising a at least one ethylenically unsaturated compound, b at least one pho toinitiator or photoinitiator system, c sensitizing amount of an N alkylindolylidene or N alkylbenzothiazolylidene alkanone as defined, and optionally d at least one organic polymeric bin der. The compositions, in layer form are useful in printing plates, litho films, photoresists, solder mask and for making image proofs. The products show sensitization to visible light.
