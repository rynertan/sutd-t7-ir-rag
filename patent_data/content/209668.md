# Thin film electroluminescence devices and process for producing the same.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a thin film EL device com prising an electrode layer, an emitting layer and an electrode layer formed on a substrate one over another, and an insulat ing layer interposed between the three layers, the emitting layer containing atoms of a rare earth element and fluorine atoms in its host material, the atom ratio F RE of the fluorine atoms F to the rear earth atoms RE being adjusted to the range of 0.5 to 2.5, and a process for producing the EL device being char acterized in that the emitting layer is prepared by forming a film under a condition substantially free from oxygen gas and or moisture and subjecting the film to a heat treatment at a temperature of 200 C to 700 C so that the host material of the emitting layer contains atoms of a rare earth element RE and fluorine atoms F in an adjusted atom raito F RE in the range of 0.5 to 2.5. The present invention affords a thin film EL device which emits, for example, a green luminescence with a high bright ness.
