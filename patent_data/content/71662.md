## Description
Method for manufacturing low density rubber foamed body The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a low density foamed body containing rubber as a main constituent. A conventional method for manufacturing foamed rubber is known according to which a mixture containing rubber, a foaming agent, and a crosslinking agent is fed into a mold, the mold is heated to foam the mixture, and the produced foamed body is released from the mold.However, with a foamed body manufactured according to this method, an expansion ratio of only about 3 to 6 and a density of about 0.15 to 0.3 are obtainable. It has thus been difficult with this method to either increase the expansion ratio or to decrease the density.When the foaming agent is used in a great amount to raise the expansion ratio, the foaming pressure within the mold rises excessively when the mold is heated.Then, when the mold is opened, the foamed body immediately expands, explodes and is scattered away. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for manufacturing a low density rubber foamed body. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method for manufacturing a rubber foamed body which has a low density as well as a low shrinking property. In order to achieve these and other objects, there is provided according to the present invention a method for manufacturing a low density rubber foamed body comprising the steps of forming a sheet from a mixture of 100 parts by weight of natural rubber or a synthetic rubber, 10 to 80 parts by weight of a foaming agent, and 0.5 to 15 by weight of a crosslinking agent enclosing said sheet within a mold and heating said mold under pressure from the exterior to thereby foam said sheet forcibly cooling said mold and releasing a foamed body from said mold. When 10 to 60 parts by weight of a thermoplastic synthetic resin are further added to the mixture in the method of the present invention described above, a rubber foamed body of low density and low shrinking property is obtainable. In accordance with the present invention, a large amount of the foaming agent may be used while preventing the drawbacks of the prior art technique such as explosion or scattering of the foamed body when the mold is opened, so that a low density rubber foamed body may be provided. A lower shrinking property may be achieved by further adding a thermoplastic synthetic resin to the raw material mixture containing natural or the synthetic rubber, the foaming agent and the crosslinking agent. The low density rubber foamed bodies obtained according to the present invention are preferably used for various kinds of cushion materials, substitutes for springs, buoys, automobile parts, heat insulators, impact absorbers, and so on. The raw material rubber to be used in this invention may be natural rubber or any kind of synthetic rubber.Examples of such synthetic rubbers include acrylonitrilebutadiene rubber NBR , chloroprene rubber CR , isoprene rubber IR , styrene butadiene rubber SBR , and ethylene propylenediene copolymer rubber EPDM .The foaming agent to be mixed with the rubber material may be any foaming agent which is used for manufacturing conventional rubber foamed bodies and may, for example, include azodicarbonamide, dinitrosopentamethylenetetramine, p toluenesulfonylhydrazine, azobisisobutyronitrile, diazoaminobenzene, and toluenesulfonyl semicarbazide.The foaming agent is used in the amount of 10 to 80 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the raw material rubber, although the preferred amount varies depending upon the kind of natural or synthetic rubber to be used as the main constituent and the density of the desired foamed body. When this amount is smaller than 10 parts by weight, a sufficiently highly foamed body may not be obtained. When this amount exceeds 80 parts by weight, the foamed body may cause breakdown, or a foamed body having adequate impact resilience may not be obtained. The method also requires a crosslinking agent in addition to the foaming agent. Preferable crosslinking agents may include sulfur, zinc oxide, and organic peroxides.Examples of organic peroxides may include dicumylperoxide, 2,5 dimethyl 2,5di tert. butyl peroxide, 1,3 bis tert. butylperoxyisopropyl benzene, m octaldecylazidoformate, and tert. butylperoxycumene. Although the amount of the crosslinking agent as mentioned above may differ depending upon the raw material rubber used, the kind and amount of foaming agent used and other conditions, it is preferably within the range of 0.5 to 15 parts by weight based on 100 parts of the raw material rubber.In addition to the foaming agent and the crosslinking agent, various other additives may optionally be added.For example, there may be added a filler such as carbon black, clay, and calcium carbonate a foaming auxiliary such as urea, stearic acid, lauric acid, and salicylic acid a metal oxide such as zinc oxide and a colorant.An antioxidant may also be included. The thermoplastic synthetic resin preferably used in the present invention may include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer resin, a polyamide resin and an acrylic resin. If the amount of the thermoplastic synthetic resin does not reach 10 parts by weight, satisfactory prevention of shrinkage may not be achieved. If this amount exceeds 60 parts by weight, the rubbery resilience is degraded, resulting in an unsatisfactory product. The raw material mixture is well kneaded in a kneader such as a roll or a mixer and is formed into a sheet. For kneading the raw material, the components other than the crosslinking agent are first well kneaded with a roll at a surface temperature of 20 to 1200C for about 15 to 60 minutes. After the crosslinking agent is added to the mixture, further kneading is performed for 5 minutes to provide a final raw material rubber sheet. Although the rubber sheet must have a thickness such that it may be put in a mold, a plurality of such rubber sheets may also be put in a single mold. Therefore, the thickness of the rubber sheet need not be the same as the size of the cavity of the mold. The raw material rubber sheet thus obtained is placed in a mold, the lid of the mold is closed, and the mold is pressed from the upper and lower sides.The raw material rubber sheet is placed in the mold so that the rubber sheet substantially fills the cavity of the mold. The shape of the mold may be arbitrary.However, after the mold is heated under pressure for foaming the sheet and the mold is opened, the foamed body abruptly pops out of the mold while expanding in volume. Therefore, the mold preferably does not have projections within the cavity and has an upwardly flared opening. For pressing the mold from the upper and lower sides thereof, a press machine may be used.According to a further preferable method, the upper and lower halves of the mold are prefixed to the press machine, and the opening and closing of the mold is performed by vertically displacing these upper and lower halves. When placing the raw material rubber sheet which has been subjected to kneading into the mold, the sheet need not be aged in advance. Thus, the sheet may be placed directly in the mold where it is subjected to heat and pressure according to the present invention. According to the conventional method for manufacturing the rubber foamed body, in order to foam the rubber sheet which has been kneaded, aging for about 24 hours has been required before the sheet may be heated under pressure as an essential step of the method. However, this aging step is not necessary according to the present invention.Even when the raw material rubber sheet is subjected to the foaming step immediately after kneading, phenomena such as foam nonuniformity and breakdown do not occur, and continuous production is possible. After the raw material has been placed within the mold, the mold is then heated under pressure for crosslinking and foaming. Although the heating temperature is mainly determined by the decomposition temperature of the foaming agent used, it is usually 130 to 2000C. The pressure to be exerted on the mold is sufficient when it is within a range of 100 to 200 kg cm2. After foaming has proceeded substantially, the mold is cooled. The cooling temperature changes according to the raw material rubber used, the kind and amount of the foaming agent used, the kind and amount of the crosslinking agent used, and other conditions.However, it is within a range of about 50 to 1000C.The cooling method adopts forcible cooling rather than natural cooling and may, for example, adopt the process of circulating water through the jacket of the mold.Circulation of air may alternatively be adopted for this purpose. When this cooling is performed, the gas pressure generated within the mold during the heating and foaming step is reduced and the bonding between the polymer molecules is also sufficiently maintained. The mold is opened under this condition. Upon opening the mold, the rubber foamed body pops out of the mold without exploding, and the volume of the foamed body instantaneously increases more than about 15 times the original volume. Thus, the low density rubber foamed body of the present invention is obtained. The density of the resultant rubber foamed body is reduced to about 0.12 or lower. The present invention will be more clearly understood from the following description made with reference to the examples.Example 1Acrylonitrile butadiene rubber NBR 100 parts by weightCarbon black 20 parts by weightStearic acid 3.0 parts by weightProcess oil 10 parts by weightDioctylphthalate 10 parts by weightAzodicarbonamide 25 parts by weightZinc oxide 5 parts by weightAntioxidant 1.5 parts by weightSulfur 0.5 part by weight 2,2,4 trimethyl 1,2 dihydroquinoline The components above excluding sulfur were kneaded for 55 minutes with a roll having a surface temperature of 30 C.

Three such pieces were placed in a mold having a cavity 150 mm in length, 230 mm in width, and 12 mm in depth.After closing the mold with a lid, the mold was pressed from the upper and lower sides thereof at a 2 pressure of 170 kg cm with a press machine. Heated vapor was introduced in the jacket of the mold to heat the sides of the mold to 1700C, and the mold was kept at this temperature for 10 minutes. The heated vapor in the jacket was removed, and water was then introduced.After 5 minutes, the mold temperature was 850C.
