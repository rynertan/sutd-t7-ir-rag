# Keying system and method of keying for electrical connectors.

## Abstract
First 4 and second 6 connector housings are keyed to each other by means of identical parts 46 which can serve as either keys or keyway plugs. The identical parts 46 are produced as a continuous strip 45 comprising a carrier strip 48 from which the parts 46 extend at spaced apart intervals. In the practice of the invention, a section of strip is used which has a number of parts 46 thereon equal to the number of keying positions in the connector assembly. One or more of the identical parts 46 are removed from the strip 45 and assembled to the first housing 4 . Thereafter the remaining parts on the strip 45 are aligned with the keying positions on the second housing 6 and assembled to the second housing 6 . The carrier strip 48 can then be separated from the remaining identical parts.
