Am. Chem. Soc. 89, 1919 et sequ. 1967 1. The therapeutic activity thereof, or of related compounds, is, however, neither disclosed nor suggested by the prior art.Accordingly, the active compounds of the novel therapeutic compositions of the invention are defined by the following general formula EMI2.1 wherein A is hydrogen, lower alkyl, fluoro or fluoro substituted methyl Rlis hydrogen, lower alkyl, or an acyl radical of a carboxylic acid having up to 12 carbon atoms W is H,H H, lower alkyl H,a OR2 , with R2 being hydrogen or an acyl radical of a carboxylic acid having up to 12 carbon atoms or CHT, with T being hydrogen, lower

or OR3 together with Q represents an alkylidenedioxy or alkylorthoalkanoate grouping and when Q is hydroxy and R3 is hydrogen, the 17a,20 20,21 bismethylenedioxy derivatives thereof.Claimed as per se novel compounds of the invention are the compounds of general formula I with the exception of the 21 acetate and 3,21 diacetate of 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8,14 hexaene 3,17a,21 triol 20 one.Lower alkyl groups included within the definitions of A,R1 and W are preferably those having up to four carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, sec.butyl, and tert. butyl, although higher homologs such as pentyl and hexyl fall within the scope of this invention.The acyl radicals of carboxylic acids having up to twelve carbon atoms included within the definitions of R,, R2, R3 and R4 may be saturated or unsaturated, straight chain or branched chain aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or cycloaliphaticaliphatic, aromatic, aryl aliphatic, or alkyl aromatic, and may be substituted, e.g., by hydroxy, aryloxy, alkoxy containing from 1 to 5 carbon atoms or halogen.Typical ester groups of the l9 nor pregnahexaenes of the formulations of our invention are thus derived from carboxylic acids such as alkanoic acids exemplified by acetic, propionic, trimethylacetic, butyric, isobutyric, valeric, isovaleric, caproic, tert.butylacetic, enanthic, caprylic, capric, cyclopentylpropionic,

i.e. hydrocarbon radicals having preferably up to 4 carbon atoms including radicals such as methylene, ethylidene, n propylidene, isopropylidene, n butylidene, and sec. butylidene.The l9 nor pregnahexaene 20 ones of this invention are crystalline solids, usually white to off white in color, which are insoluble in water and soluble in most organic solvents, particularly in acetone, dioxane, dimethylformamide, and dimethylsulfoxide, although of limited solubility in non polar solvents such as dialkylethers and alkylhydrocarbons.The l9 nor pregnahexaene 20 ones of formula m exhibit antimitotic activity and, in particular, are useful in the treatment and control of psoriasis.Useful l9 nor pregnahexaene 20 ones of formula I include 16a methyl l9 nor pregna 1,3 ,5 10 ,6 ,8,14 hexaene 3,l7a,2l triol 20 one 21 acetate and the 6 methyl, 6 fluoro, 6 difluoromethyl and 6 trifluoromethyl derivates thereof, as well as the 16 desmethyl analogs and the 16ss methyl epimers thereof 16a hydroxy substituted compounds of formula I and ester and 16a,17a alkylidenedioxy derivatives thereof such as 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8,14 hexaene 3,16a,17a,21 tetrol 20 one 16,21 diacetate and 16a,17a isopropylidenedioxy 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8, 14 hexaene 3, 21 diol 20 one 21 acetate 16 alkylidene substituted compounds of formula I such as 16 methylene 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8,14 hexaene 3,17 alpha ,21 triol 20 one 21 acetate and the 3 acetate and 3 methyl ether derivatives thereof and the 15 chloro derivatives of the foregoing.Of the compounds of formula I, especially useful for the treatment of psoriasis are the 16a alkyl substituted compounds i.e. compounds of formula I wherein W is H,a alkyl , preferred compounds being the 16a methyl 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8,14 hexaene 20 ones of the general formulaEMI5.1 wherein R1, R3 and R4 are as defined above for formula I . Among the compounds of formula II , particularly useful antipsoriatic agents are those wherein R4 is hydrogen and, of these, especially those wherein R3 is hydrogen or acetyl. Of the foregoing, a particularly preferred species is 16a methy l9 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8,14 hexaene 3,17a,21 triol 20 one 21 acetate, which exhibits superior anti mitotic activity at topical doses as low as 20 micrograms when administered topically to mice in which epidermal mitosis has been stimulated by prior application of croton oil.Further preferred compounds of formula II include the 3 acetate and 3 benzoate ester and the 3 methyl ether derivatives of the former 16a methyl 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8,14 hexaene 3,17a,21 triol 20 one and the 21 propionate, 17 propionate and 17,21di n butyrate ester derivatives of the latter.The l9 nor pregnahexaene 20 ones of formula I are conveniently prepared from the corresponding 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 , 6, 8 pentaene 20 ones by dehydrogenation in position 14, most suitably by reaction with a molar equivalent of 2,3dichloro 5,6 dicyanobenzoquinone DDQ in an aprotic solvent usually dioxane in an essentially neutral medium. Alternatively, an appropriate ll unsubstituted pregna 1,4,6,8,14pentaene 3 one can be subjected to aromatization e.g. by means of a weak base, desirably in the presence of a soluble halide salt such as lithium chloride , or an appropriate 9a,11ss dihalogeno pregna 1,4,6 triene 3 one can be subjected to concomitant didehydrohalogenation and aromatization a specific embodiment being concomitant 6 dehydrogenation, didehydrochlorination and aromatization of an appropriate 9a,11ss dichloro pregna 1,4 diene 3 one, suitably in situ, at elevated temperatures, by means of DDQ as dehydrogenating agent and in the presence of an acid in an aprotic solvent . Isolation of the respective l9 nor pregnahexaene20 ones is then effected by methods well known in the steroid art.When the above 14 dehydrogenation of a 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8 pentaene 20 one precursor is carried out in the presence of at least a molar equivalent of hydrogen chloride and with about two molar equivalents of DDQ, there are formed the respective 15 chloro 19 nor pregnahexaene 20 ones of formula I .Thus, for example, reaction of 16a methyl 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8 pentaene 3,17a,21 triol 20 one 21 acetate in dioxane with at least a molar equivalent of hydrogen chloride and with about two molar equivalents ofDDQ yields 15 chloro 16a methyl 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8,14 hexaene 3,17a,21 triol 20 one 21 acetate, having anti mitotic activity. Similarly, by substituting hydrogen bromide for hydrogen chloride, the respective 15 bromo compounds are obtained. Alternatively, a 15 chloro or bromo substituent may be introduced by reacting the respective 15 unsubstituted 1,3,5 10 ,6,8,14 hexaene with halogenating agents such as molecular chlorine or bromine, or N halo imides e.g. N halosuccinimide , or hydrogen halide in the presence of DDQ.The foregoing process utilizing hydrogen chloride and DDQ for preparing the 15 chloro substituted compounds of this invention is preferably carried out at room temperature although temperatures in the range of from about OO to 1000C maybe employed and in dioxane although other aprotic solvents may be used, particularly ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, diethylether and diglyme . When carried out at room temperature, the reaction is usually complete in 30 minutes as determined by thin layer chromatography, although at lower temperatures it may take up to 24 hours before complete conversion of a l9 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8 pentaene 20 one to the corresponding 15 chloro 14 dehydro compound has been effected.Although, in our process, only a molar equivalent of hydrogen chloride is required per mole of the pregnapentaene 20 one starting compound, we prefer to use large excesses of hydrogen chloride e.g. a saturated solution of hydrogen chloride in dioxane since the rate of reaction is thereby increased and the pro cess is completed in thirty minutes or less.Many of the l9 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8 pentaene 20 o intermediates from which the l9 nor pregnahexaene 20 ones of this invention may be obtained are known in the art e.g. described in U.S. Patent Specifications Nos. 3,182,057 and 3,182,075 and have been prepared by reaction of a 9 alpha ,11S dichloro 1,4 pregnadiene 17a, 21 diol 3,20 dione 21 alkanoate e.g. 16 alpha methyl 9 alpha , 11ss dichloro 1,4 pregnadiene 17 alpha ,21 diol 3,20 dione 21 acetate with a weak base, preferably in the presence of lithium chloride. Weak bases useful in this process are pyridine, collidine, lutidine and, preferably, dimethylformamide.Other 19 nor pregnapentaene 20 one intermediates may also be prepared from the corresponding 9a,11ss dichloro 1,4 pregnadiene 3,20 diones in similar manner.The 9 alpha ,11ss dichloro 1,4 pregnadiene 17 alpha ,21 diol 3,20 dione precursors to the 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8 pentaene 20 one intermediates are also knownin the art and may be prepared from the corresponding 9 11 dehydro derivatives according to procedures such as described in U.S. Patents Nos.2,894,963 and 3,009,933.When preparing a 16 alkylidene compound of formula I i.e. a compound wherein W is CHT one may start with a 9 alpha ,11ss dichloro 16 alkylidene 1,4 pregnadiene 17 alpha ,21 diol 3,20 dione 21 lower alkanoate precursor and convert it to a 16 alkylidene 19 nor pregna 1,3 10 , 6,8 pensaene and thence to the 14 dehydro analog of formula I according so the process described hereinalove. Alternatively to minimize side reactions which occur when halogenating a 16 methylene 17 alpha hydroxy 1,4,9,11 pregnatriene 3,20 dione, one may protect the 17a hydroxyl function thereof, e.g. by esterifica tint, after introduction of jYe 9 11 double bond.

It is preferred to utilize lower alkanoate ester derivatives usually acetates of the 19 nor pregnapentaene 20 one intermediates, thereby producing the 19 norpregnahexaene 20 ones of formulae I and II as 21 alkanoates, usually 21 acetates the corresponding 21 free hydroxy compound is then easily obtained from the 21 alkanoate via known hydrolytic procedures, such as with aqueous sodium bicarbonate in methanol or by utilizing diastase enzyme of malt in aqueous ethanol using known procedures.In general, when a 21 mono lower alkanoate or a 17,21 dilower alkanoate derivative of a 3 ree hydroxy 19 nor pregna hexaene 20 one of formula I is desired, it is preferable to use as starting compound a l9 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8 pentaene 20 one intermediate containing the desired 21 mono alkanoate or 17,21 di alkanoate ester function prior to reaction with DDQ.A 17 mono lower alkanoate ester derivative of a 3 fr hydroxy 19 nor pregnahexaene 20 one of formula I may be prepared by reaction of the respective 17 free hydroxy compound e.g. 16a methyl 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8,14 hexaene 3,17a,21 triol 20 one in an aprotic solvent e.g. dimethylsulfoxide with at least one molar equivalent of a tri lower alkyl orthoester e.g. triethylorthopropionate in the presence of a strong acid e.g. p toluenesulfonic acid followed by hydrolytic cleavage of the resulting 17a,21 orthoester by means of aqueous acid e.g. aqueous acetic acid , thence se paration and isolation of the 17 mono ester using known techniques, usually including chromatographic methods, whereby there is obtained a 17 mono alkanoate e.g. the 17 propionate ..By this procedure, there is usually also produced some of the corresponding 21 mono alkanoate derivatives e.g. the 21 propionate which may also be isolated via chromatographic techniques.A 3,17 diester derivative of formula I is conveniently prepared from a corresponding 3 tEree hydroxy 17a,21 ortho ester obtainable as described hereinabove by reaction thereof with an acid anhydride or acid halide in pyridine e.g. acetic anhydride in pyridine to form the corresponding 3 esterified hydroxy 17a,21 orthoester, which, after hydrolytic cleavage of the 17a,21 orthoester group by means of aqueous acetic acid, yields a 3,17 diester of formula I .The 3,21 diester derivatives of formula I are conveniently prepared from the corresponding 21 monoesters the 3,17a,21 triesters may be prepared from the corresponding 17a,21 or 3,17a diesters utilizing conventional esterification techniques.To prepare a 3 monoester derivative of formula I it is often necessary to protect the 21 hydroxyl group e.g. by an ether derivative such as the 21 methoxyethoxymethyl ether in the 9 alpha ,11ss dichloro 1,4 pregnadiene 3,21 dione precursor e.g. by reaction of 16a mthl 9a,lls dichloro 1,4 pregnadiene 17 alpha ,21 diol 3,20 dione with N,N,N triethyl N methoxyethoxymethyl ammonium chloride in acetonitr e prior to reaction thereof with a weak base in the pressure of lithium chloride to produce the corresponding 3 free hy xy l9 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8 pentaene 20 one e.g. 16a methyl 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8 pentaene 3,17 alpha ,21 triol 20 one 21 methoxyethoxymethyl ether .

The method of use aspect of this invention resides in elici ting a mitotic inhibitory response in a warm blooded animal having a disease characterized by rapid cell proliferation, which comprises administering to said animal a non toxic, mitotic inhibitory effective amount of a 19 nor pregnahexaene 20 one of formula I defined hereinabove, usually together with a non toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, parti cularly in the treatment and control of proliferative skin diseases, primarily for the treatment of psoriasis via the topical route. Psoriasis is characterized by increased epidermipoiesis associated with a high mitotic rate, rapid cell turnover and altered keratinization. The psoriatic epidermis can be nor malized by slowing down cell growth through inhibiting mito sis. All drugs currently used in psoriasis therapy are known to directly or indirectly reduce epidermal mitotic activity. Although there is no animal model for psoriasis, many of these same drugs have been reported to have a similar effect in models of epidermal hyperplasia which simulate psoriasis in laboratory animals. Topically effective anti psoriatic drugs, including corti costeroids, anthralin, coal tar and 5 fluorouracil, while relatively free of systemic side effects, cause local adverse reactions. Thus, corticosteroid therapy causes skin atrophy, telangiectasia and the formation of striae, while anthralin and 5 fluorouracil are skin irritants and require close clinical supervision for optimal therapeu tic benefit. Anthralin can also cause staining of the skin. It has now been discovered that compounds according to gene ral formula I particularly 16a methyl 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8,14 hexaene 3,17a,21 triol 20 one 21 acetate reduce epidermal mitotic acitivty without causing signifi cant local or systemic hormonal or toxic effects when applied topically to the skin of mice in which epidermal mitosis has been stimulated. Specifically, when treated by a procedure modified from S. Belman and W. Troll, Cancer Research 32 450 454 1972 , the 19 nor pregnahexaene 20 ones of this invention, particu larly the 16a methyl derivatives of formula II , reduce cro ton oil stimulated epidermal mitosis in mice when applied topically. Moreover, they are non irritating without causing hormonal side effects, which is surprising in view of the 19 nor pregnahexaene 20 one structure containing an aromatic A ring such as in many estrogens, and a corticoid side chain such as in potent topical anti inflammatory agents. In the foregoing test, croton oil is applied topically to shaved mice, thus accelerating mitosia. A 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8,14 hexaene 3,17a,21 triol 20 one of this in vention is applied topically to the stimulated site, then 24 hours later portions of the treated skin are excised for histologic processing, mitotic figures per thousand basal interfollicular epidermal cells being counted in a light microscope. Epidermal mitotic counts from treated mice are compared to counts from lesion controls for statistically significant differences with an analysis of variance. The mitotic count for each compound tested is expressed as per r cent reduction of mitoses compared with the number of mitoses on the skin of mice treated with croton oil alone.In general, it was discovered that the 19 nor pregnahexaene 20 ones of this invention formula I significantly reduce cro ton oil stimulated epidermal mitosis. For example, the 16a methyl 19 nor pregnahexaene 20 ones of formula II usually exhibit over 60 inhibitions of mitoses at a 2 mg topical dose. 16a Methyl l9 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8,14 hexaene 3,17a,21 triol 20 one 21 acetate a preferred compound of the invention exhibits about 80 reduction of mitosis even at a topical dose as low as 0.2 mg which is approximately 10 times greater than the mitotic reduction exhibited by an equal quantity i.e. 0.2 mg of betamethasone dipropionate a known anti psoriatic agent in the same animal model.The anti mitotic activity is also demonstrated by similar tests in mice whereby increased epidermal mitosis is produced by ultraviolet irradiation according to procedures modified from A. DuVivier and R.B. Stoughton, J. InvestigativeDermatology, 65 233 237 1975 . In these tests, it was demonstrated that the 19 nor pregnahexaene 20 ones of this invention, particularly 16a methyl 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8, 14 hexaene 3,17a,21 triol 20 one 21 acetate, significantly reduce epidermal mitotic rate following 1, 5 or 9 topical applications each with 0.02 mg, 0.10 mg, and 0.5 mg doses to ultraviolet stimulated hairless mouse epidermis, advantageously causing an epidermal thinning effect after multiple applications when the effect became equivalent to that demonstrated by steroidal anti psoriatic agents such as betamethasone valerate. Since the compounds of this invention such as defined by formulae I and iI do not cause estrogenic or other hormonal or toxic effects when applied topically as demonstrated by tests in mice continued applications of a 19 nor pregnahexaene 20 one of this invention will not cause irritation or staining of the skin or skin atrophy as caused by known anti psoriatic agents.The foregoing mode of antipsoriatic activity of the 19 nor pregnahexaene 20 ones of this invention is different from that demonstrated by known steroidal anti psoriatic agents such as betamethasone valerate which, when applied topically to ultraviolet stimulated hairless mouse epidermis at doses equal to those of our l9 nor pregnahexaene 20 ones e.g. 16a methyl 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8,14 hexaene 3,17a,21 triol 20 one 21 acetate first cause an epidermal thinning without reduction of mitoses.The 19 nor pregnahexaene 20 ones of this invention, particularly 16a methyl 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8,14 hexaene 3,17a,21 tricl 20 one 21 acetate, have also been found to exhibit anti mitotic activity when administered orally or parenterally to mice, without causing significant local or systemic hormonal or toxic effects.In view of the anti mitotic and anti acanthotic i.e., reduction of epidermal thickening activity as tested in mice , of the l9 nor pregnahexaene 20 ones of this invention, parti cularly when applied topically, the invention includes the concept of treating and controlling psoriasis which comprises applying topically to the affected area, in a concentration effective for the treatment of psoriasis, a 19 nor pregnahexaene 20 one of formula I , usefully together with a nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.Preferred anti psoriatic agents of this invention are the 16 methyl 19 norpregnahexaene 20 ones, especially the 16a methyl compounds of formula II , particularly 16a methyl 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8,14 hexaene 3,17a,21 triol 20 one 21 acetate and the 3 acetate, 3 benzoate and 15 chloro derivatives thereof. Included within the term topically applying are applica tins onto the skin surface whereby the compounds of the in vention are effective in the treatment and control of skin diseases characterized by rapid and or abnormal cell prolifera tion, e.g. psoriasis aerosol application and subcutaneous injection application whereby they are effective in the treat ment of locaepidermal disorders. Conveniently, a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a 19 nor pregnahexaene 20 one of formula I , preferably a 16a methyl compound of formula II , such asl6a methyl 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8,14 hexaene 3,17a,21 triol 20 one 21 ace tate, in a non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, usually in concentrations from about 0.0001 percent to about 5 percent, preferably from about 0.1 percent to about one percent, is applied several times daily to skin affected by psoriasis until the psoriatic condition has improved. Topical applications may then be continued at less frequent inter vals e.g. once a day to control mitoses in order to pre vent return of severe psoriatic conditions.In general, appli cation is in any topical form including creams, lotions, aerosols and ointments, prepared by combining the active in gredient with conventional pharmaceutical diluents and car riers as used in topical formulations comprising steroids conveniently in a liquid solvent, preferably in a water miscible liquid carrier made up of hydrophylic liquids having a high s6lvating action, e.g. a solution of 16a methyl 19 nor pregna l,3,5 10 ,6,S,14 hexaene 3,17a,21 triol 20 one 21 acetate in polyethyleneglycol. Thus, the pharmaceutical formulation aspect of this inven tion resides in the concept of a pharmaceutical cqulpooition, preferably for topical application, comprising an anti psoria tically effective amount of a l9 nor pregnahexaene 20 one of formula I together with a non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferred are topical formulations comprising 16a methyl 19 nor pregnahexaene 20 ones of formula II , particularly 16 a methyl derivatives thereof having a free hydroxyl function at C 17, pharmaceutical formulations comprising. 16a methyl 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8,14 hexaene 3,17a 21, triol 20 one 21 acetate being particularly valuable.The pharmaceutical formulations may be made according to known procedures, some of which are described in detail hereinbelow. Typical formulations include ointments, lotions, creams, sprays, powders, drops e.g. ear drops , suppositories, and aerosols. Ointments and creams nay, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and or gelling agents. Such bases may, thus, for example, include water and or an oil such as liquid paraffin or a vegetable oil such as peanut oil or castor oil . Thickening agents which may be used according to the nature of the base include soft paraffin, aluminium stearate, cetostearyl alcohol, polyethyleneglycols, woolfat, hydrogenated lanolin, beeswax, etc.Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will, in general, also include one or more of the following, namely, stabilizing agents, emulsifying agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, coloring agents, perfumes and the like. Powders may be formed with the aid of any suitable powder base, e.g.talc, lactose, starch, etc. Drops may be formulated with an aqueous base or non aqueous base, also comprising one or more dispersing agents, suspending agents, solubilizing agents, etc.The topical pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may also include one or more preservatives or bacteriostatic agents, e.g. methyl hydroxybenzoate, propyl hydroxybenzoate, chlorocresol, benzalkonium chloride, etc. They may also contain other active ingredients such as antimicrobial agents, particularly antibiotics.The inventive concept also includes pharmaceutical formulations for oral or parenteral administration, obtainable by standard procedures and comprising an anti mitotic amount of a 19 nor pregna 1,3,5 10 ,6,8,14 hexaene 20 one of formula I together with a non toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.The proportion of active steroid in the topical coppsitions according to the invention depends on the precise type of formulations to be prepared,but will generally be within the range of from 0.0001 to 5 by weight. Generally, however, for most types of topical preparations the proportions of active steroid used will be within the range of from 0.1 to 3 and preferably 0.1 to 1 . Based upon studies in mice, when administered systemically, preferably parenterally, the dosage necessary to produce an anti mitotic response is in the range of from about 1 to about 100 mg per kilogram body weight. The following Formulations exemplify some of the dosage forms in Which the anti mitotic agents of our invention may be awployed.
