They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly.Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about 0.1 to 99S by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid inert diluent s . More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Table V Weight Percent Active ingredient Diluent s Surfactant s Wettable Powders 20 90 0 74 1 10Oil Suspensions, 3 50 40 95 0 15Emulsions, Solutions. including EmulsifiableConcentrates Aqueous Suspension 10 50 40 84 1 20Dusts 1 25 70 99 0 5Granules and Pellets 0.1 95 5 99.9 0 15High Strength 90 99 0 10 0 2Compositions Active ingredient plus at least one of a surfactant or a diluent equals 100 weight percent. Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can.of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are some times desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents andCarriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books. Caldwell, NewJersey, but other solids, either mined or manufactured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed., lnterscience, New York, 1950. Solubility under 0.1 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at OOC. McCutcheon s Detergents andEmulsifiers Annual . MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood.New Jersey. as well as Sisely and Wood. Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents , Chemical Publishing Co.,Inc., New York. 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foaming, caking. corrosion, microbiological growth, etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Little, U.S. Patent 3.060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E.Browning. Agglomerationµ, Chemical Engineering.

Utility Test results show that the compounds of the present invention are active herbicides. They are useful for the selective pre or postemergence weed control in crops, especially in rice, cotton, sugar beets and soybeans. The rates of application for the compounds of the invention are determined by a number of factors.including the crop species involved, the types of weeds to be controlled. weather and climate, formulations selected, mode of application, amount of foliage present, etc. In general terms, the subject compounds should be applied at levels of around 0.03 to 10 kg ha, the lower rates being suggested for use on lighter soils and or those having a low organic matter content or for situations where only short term persistence is required or for situations where the weed species are easily controlled postemergence. The compounds of this invention are particularly useful for the control of weeds in rice. They may be used for both paddy and dryland rice. They may be applied postemergence to dryland rice. They may also be applied to paddy rice after transplanting as a spray or granule. The application may be made from 0 to 2 leaf stage of barnyardgrass growth. Rates of 0.03 to 1 kg ha will provide weed control. The rate selected for use will depend on the method and timing of application, chemical used, size of weeds, soil type. and other factors. One with ordinary skill in the art can select the rate for any given situation. The compounds are particularly useful for the control of barnyardgrass Echinochloa crusgalli . a pernicious weed in rice culture, but may also provide complete or partial control of other weeds, particularly gramineous weeds. in rice. The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with any other commercial herbicide, examples of which are those of the triazine, triazole.uracil, urea, amide, diphenylether, carbamate, bipyridylium and sulfonylurea types. In particular. the compounds of this invention may be mixed with other rice herbicides to provide a broader spectrum of weed control, extended control or other benefits. They are especially useful for use in conjunction with sulfonylureas selective in rice such as 2 4,6 dimethoxypyrimidin 2 yl aminocarbonylj aminosulfonylmethyl benzoic acid, methyl ester. 5 E 4, 6 dimethoxypyrimidin 2 yl aminocarbonyl amino sulfonyl l methylpyrazole 4 carboxylic acid, ethyl ester, N 4. 6 dimethoxy 2 pyrimidinyl aminocarbonyl 3 pentafluoro l propenyl 2 thiophenesulfonamide. 3 l chloro 2,2 difluoroethenyl N t 4,6 dimethoxy 2 pyrimidinyl aminocarbonyl 2 thiophenesulfonamide, 3 chloro 5 C4,6 dimethoxy 2 pyrimidinyl aminocar bonyl aminosulfonyl l methyl lH pyrazole 4 carboxylic acid, methyl ester and 3 chloro 5 4 methoxy 6 methylpyrimidin 2 yl aminocarbonyliaminosulfonyli 1 methyl lH pyrazole 4 carboxylic acid, methyl ester.
