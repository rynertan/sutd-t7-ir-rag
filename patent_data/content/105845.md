## Description
APPARATUS FOR PUMPING THE BLOOD IN EXTRACORPOREALDIALYSIS THROUGH AN ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY This invention relates to an apparatus for pumping the blood especially apted to be used in extracor poreal dialysis through an artificial kidney. All know apparatus used for pumping the blood, for instance in extracorporeal dialysis, even if able to operate satisfactori ly may often cause alterations of the blood owing to the crushing of the blood corpucles. This crushing for instance is likely to take place in the pumps used at present for pumping the blood in the extracorporeal dialysis system, namely peristaItic pumps. This invention is intended to provide a pumping apparatus wherein this drawback is overcome. The pumping apparatus of the invention comprises a rigid housing consisting of two identical shells or caps of elongated form joined at their peripheral edges, which edges sealingly hold therebetween the periphery of a resilient membrane dividing the space inside the housing into t.woFidentical chambers. Each elongated cap has two pipe fittings. The apparatus of invention is shown in a preferred application wherein the same is connected in the circuit of a extracorporeal dialysis sistem between a pneumatic machine and dialyzer. More precisely a first chamber is connected to the dialyzer through a pipe fitting thereof and the other chamber is connected to the pneumatic machine through a pipe fitting thereof. The other pipe fitting of the one chamber can be used to introduce any proper medicine into the blood while the other pipe fitting of the other chamber can be connected to any suitable instrument. In operation, the pneumatic machine created alternatively a vacuum and a pressure in the other chamber causing the resilient membrane to deflect in and out in respect of this chamber. Consequently the volume of the first chamber is correspondingly increased or descreased alter natively. This variation of the volume of the first chamber causes the blood of the patient, to be subjected to extracorporeal dialysis and connected to the dialyzer through a drawing chamber, to be sucked into the dialyzer, to be dialyzed and then to be returned to the patient. The apparatus of the invention has one more advantageous.feature, namely that only a needle can be used both for drawing the blood out of the patient and returning the same to the latter after the dialysis.has taken place. The apparatus of the invention will be now described more particularly with.reference to the accompayning drawing wherein fig. 1 is a sectional view of the apparatus and fig. 2 shows diagrammatically an extracorporeal dialysis system including the apparatus shown in fig. 1. Referring firstly to fig. 1 the pumping apparatus of the invention comprises substantially a rigid housing 10 and an inner membrane 11. Rigid housing 10 consists of a first rigid elongated cap 12 and a second rigid elongated cap 13 identical with cap 12. The peripheral edge 14 of cap 12 and peripheral edge 15 of cap 13 are suitably firmly joined toge ther and they sealingly hold therebetween the perriphery 16 of resilient membrane 11 consequently resilient membrane 11 divides the inner space of the housing into two identical chambers referred to by numerals 18 and 19. First cap 12 has two pipe fittings referred to by references 20 and 21 and second cap 13 has two pipe fittings referred to by references 22 and 23. As illustrated in fig. 2, chamber 18 of the apparatus of the invention is connected to dialyzerDL for instance, through pipe fitting 20 and hose 24, and chamber,19 is connected to pneumatic machine PM, for instance, through pipe fitting 22 and hose 25. As shown for sake of completeness, dialyzerDL is connected to a vein of the patient arm PA by means of a needle NL through drawing chamber DC. As stated above, pipe fitting 21 can be used to introduce in the patient blood any proper medicine while pipe fitting 23 can be used for connecting chamber 19 to any suitable instrument,as a manometer. In operation pneumaticimachine PM timely creates, alternatively, a vacuum and a pressure in cham ber 19 through hose 25 and consequently resilient membrane 11 is alternatively deflected in this chamber, as shown in full line and out thereof as shown in dotted line . These deflections of resilient membrane 11 al t,ernatively increase and decrease the volume of chamber 18 that is sealed off chamber 19, which chamber 18 consequently performs a pumping action on the blood of the patient through hose 26, drawing chamber DC, hose 27 and needle NL. The operation of pneumatic machine PM and dia lyzer DL is timed and accordingly the blood to be dialyzed is sucked into dialyzer DL, dialyzed therein, and then returned to the patient. It will be appreciated that by making use of the apparatus of the invention, the blood circulation, i.e. chamber 18, hose 24 dialyzer DL , hose 25, drawing chamber DC hose 27, needle NL, is completely separate from the gas circulation, i.e. chamber 19, hose 25 and pneumatic machine PM. Furthermore it will be appreciated that the simmetric shape of caps 12 and 13 makes the apparatus capable to be inverted in the dialysis system, i.e.chamber 18 can be connected to pneumatic..machine PM and chamber 19 can be connected to dialyzer DL without affecting the apparatus operation. This feature makes it impossible lo make mistakes in connecting the apparatus to the dialyzer system. The pneumatic machine PMldialyzer DL and dra wing chamber DC are well known in the art and will not be described here. It will be understood that the structure details of this apparatus can be modified in respect of what setforth and partially illustrated, without de parting from the scope and concepts of the inven tion.
