## Description
HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDSThis invention relates to certain novel substituted pyrazoline compounds, their preparation, formulations containing them, and the use of such compounds or formulations in medicine.1 Phenyl 2 pyrazolines wherein the phenyl ring is substituted in the 3 position by a tbutyl, carboxy or trifluoromethyl group, or in the 4 position by a halo or methoxy group, are disclosed as anti inflammatory agents in European Patent Specification 0 055 418.We have now found that the novel l phenyl 2 pyrazolines of formula I as defined hereinbelow having one of a certain class of sulphur or oxygen containing substituents in the 3 position of the phenyl ring and, optionally one or more further substituents unexpectedly inhibit the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism both in vitro and in vivo. These novel compounds are useful as anti inflammatory, anti allergic, analgesic or anti pyretic agents, or agents for use in the prevention of tissue rejection.Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula I EMI1.1 whereinY is a group selected from alkylthio, alkenylthio, arylthio, alkylsulphinyl, alkenylsulphinyl, arylsulphinyl, alkylsulphonyl, alkenylsulphonyl, arylsulphonyl, alkoxy, alkenyloxy, or aryloxy, in which group any hydrogen atom is optionally replaced by a halogen atom each X is the same or different and is independently selected from alkylthio, alkenylthio, arylthio, alkylsulphinyl, arylsulphinyl, alkenylsulphinyl, alkylsulphonyl, alkenylsulphonyl, arylsulphonyl, alkoxy, alkenyloxy, aryloxy, alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, trihaloalkyl, or halogen n is O to 4 R1 is hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aralkyl or aryI R2 is hydrogen, alkyl, acyl of 1 4 carbon atoms, aroyl of 6 10 carbon atoms or alkoxycarbonyl orR1 and R2 together representEMI2.1 where X is a suitable substituent and m is 0 5 andR3 and R4 are the same or different and each represents hydrogen or alkyl provided that when R1 is other than hydrogen, R2 is not acyl or aroyl and the pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salts thereof.In formula I and throughout the specification the following definitions apply unless the context otherwise requires a The term alkyl , either alone, or when included as part of another group, for example, alkoxy, shall be taken to refer to an alkyl or cycloalkyl group having from I to 6 carbon atoms, and, preferably, 1 to 4 carbon atoms. b The terms alkenyl and alkynyl either alone or as part of another group shall be taken to refer to alkenyl and alkynyl groups each of which has from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, and preferably 3 or 4 carbon atoms. c The term ttacyl shall be taken to refer to a radical of formula RaCO wherein Ra is hydrogen or an aliphatic moiety. Examples of acyl groups include formyl, acetyl and propionyl. td The term aroyl shall be taken to refer to a radical of formula RbCO wherein Rb is an aryl or aryl containing moiety such as phenyl or benzyl. e The term aralkyl shall be taken to refer to an alkyl group substituted by one or more aryl groups. f The term aryl group , either alone or as part of another group, for example aralkyl, shall unless otherwise specified be taken to refer to an monocyclic or polycyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic ring system of from 5 to 10 atoms, selected from carbon, oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen, which may optionally be substituted by one or more suitable substituents. Examples of aryl groups include, phenyl, pyridyl, quinolyl and naphthyl particularly preferred is phenyl. g Suitable substituents include those known to persons skilled in the art for the substitution of aromatic ring systems, for example, halo, alkyl, trihaloalkyl, carboxy, alkoxy, hydroxy, alkylthio, amino optionally substituted by one or more alkyl groups , alkysulphinyl and alkylsulphonyl the alkyl group of which may optionally be substituted by one or more halogen atoms .Since the compounds of formula I inhibit the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, they exhibit some of the properties of the non steroidal or aspirinlike anti inflammatory drugs, such as reduction of erythema, oedema and pain associated with prostaglandins leading to good symptomatic relief. However, aspirin like drugs are nbt effective against the leucocyte mediated aspects of chronic inflammatory disease, since they do not inhibit leukcotriene formation.Anti inflammatory corticosteroids indirectly inhibit the production of both prostaglandins and leukotrienes which could, in part, account for their superior therapeutic effects. However, steroid treatment is associated with serious local or systemic side effects and prolonged administration is contra indicated in many inflammatory conditions.The present invention fulfils the need for a non steroid anti inflammatory compound which inhibits the synthesis of leukotrienes and prostaglandins, and which is free from steroid related toxicity.In addition, the compounds of formula I exhibit low levels of toxicity and favourable therapeutic indices. Compounds of formula I , or pharmaceutically acceptable formulations thereof, may therefore be administered at low dosages to achieve a therapeutically effective level of anti inflammatory activity. Included within the scope of the compounds of formula I and their pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salts are those wherein RÚ is other than aralkyl and R2 is other than aroyl. Within this subclass are those compounds and salts wherein both R1 and R2 are hydrogen, and also those where Y is alkylthio and or n is 0, and R3 and R4 are preferably hydrogen.Preferred compounds of formula I and their pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salts include those wherein Y is alkylthio or trihalo alkysulphonyl, n is 0, R1 is other than aryl, R2 is other than alkoxycarbonyl and R3 and R4 are both hydrogen.Particularly preferred are those compounds and salts wherein Y is alkylthio, n is 0, R1 is hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or benzyl wherein benzyl is optionally substituted in the benzene ring by one or more suitable substituents such as alkoxy, eg. methoxy R2 is other than alkoxycarbonyl and R3 and R4 are both hydrogen.An especially preferred compound of formula I is that compound where n is 0, Y is methylthio, and R1, R2, R3 and R4 are each hydrogen ie. 1 3 methylthiophenyl 3 amino 2 pyrazoline, and its pharmacologically acceptable acid addtion salts.Other compounds of formula I include the following compounds and their pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salts N l 3 methylthiophenyl 2 pyrazolin 3 yl lf ormamide 3 methylamino 1 3 methylthiophenyI 2 p yrazoline 3 amino I 3 trifluoromethylsulphonyl phenylj 2 pyrazoline 3 amino 1 3 methoxyphenyl 2 pyrazoline N r1 3 methylthiophenyl 2 pyrazolin 3 yJ acetamide 1 3 methylthiophenyl 3 2 propynylamino 2 pyrazoline l 3 methylthiophenyl 3 2 propenylamino 2 pyrazoline 3 4 methoxybenzylamino 1 3 methylthiophenyl 2 pyrazoline When used in medicine, the acid addition salts of a compound of formula I should be both pharmacologically and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, but non acceptable salts may conveniently be used to prepare the bases of such acceptable salts and are not excluded from the scope of this invention.
