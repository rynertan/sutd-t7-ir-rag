In Fig. 1, I A, I B, II A, IT B ..... represent record tracks, in whichI A, II A, III A, show loci drawn by a head A while I B, II B, III B, ..... show loci drawn by a head B with an azimuth angle of 6 not shown between the head A and the head B. I T 2 1 3 represent line numbers with symbols R and B representing chrominance signals in the corresponding lines.For aPAL signal, phase of a R Y signal is reversed for each line with R representing a positive R Y signal and B representing a negative R Y signal. For a SECAM signal, the R Y signal and te B Y signal are transmitted alternately for each line with R representing the transmission of the R Y signal and B representing theB Y signal. A symbol aH represents the amount of offset of a horizontal synchronizing signal between adjacent tracks. In the VHS system PAL SECAM signalVTR, a H is set to 1.5. Under this condition, a track pitch Tp is equal to 49 pm and a tape speed is equal to 23.4 mm second. In the VHS system PAL SECAM signal VTR, the horizontal synchronizing signals of the adjacent tracks are arranged side by side and the adjacent chrominance signals are also arranged side by side. That is, R is next to R, and B is next to B. A special reproduction mode still, slow motion, fast forward and reverse reproduction modes such a VTR is now explained. Figs. 2, 3 and 4 show loci of the heads in the still reproduction mode, fast forward reproduction mode and reverse reproduction mode, respectively, in which commat represents a reproduced locus by the head A and represents a reproduced locus by the head B. In Fig. 2, the heads A and B draw the same locus. Since the azimuth angle is provided between the head A and the head B as described above, the head A reproduces only the signal of the locus drawn by the head A and the head B reproduces only the signal of the locus drawn by the head B. Accordingly, in Figs. 2 to 14, the signals in the hatched areas are reproduced.InFig. 2, the head A reproduces the signal in the hatched area and the head B reproduces the signal in the hatched area B. In the special reproduction mode, the recorded locus is jumped during a reproduction cycle by one head or the signal sequence is different from that of normal reproduction mode when the heads are switched from one to the other. Those conditions are classified as follows 1 During one reproduction cycle by one head, the locus is jumped two recorded loci ahead in the fast forward reproduction mode . In Fig. 3, the locus is jumped from the locus I A to the locus II A for the head A, and from the locus III B to the locus IV B for the head B. 2 In the switching of the heads, the locus is p. jumped to one recorded locus ahead in the still slow motion, fast forward and reverse reproduction modes . In Fig. 2, the locus is jumped from the locusI B for the head B to the locus II A for the head A, and in Fig. 4 the locus is jumped from the locus III A for the head A to the locus III B for the head B. 3 In the switching of the heads, the locus is jumped three recorded locus ahead in the fast forward reproduction mode . In Fig. 3, the locus is jumped from the locus .II A for the head A to the locus III B for the head B. 4 In the switching of the heads, the locus is jumped one locus behind in the still, slow and reverse reproduction modes . In Fig. 2, the locus is jumped from the locus II A for the head A to the locus I B for the head B, and in Fig. 4 the locus is jumped from the locus II B for the head B to the locus II A for the head A. 5 During one reproduction cycle by one head, the locus is jumped two recorded loci behind in the still, slow and reverse reproduction modes . In Fig. 4, the locus is jumped from the locusIV A for the head A to the locus III A, from the locus II A to the locus I A, and from the locus III B for the head B to the locus II B. In the above five cases, the continuity of the horizontal synchronizing signal and the continuity of the chrominance signal are important. If the continuity of the horizontal synchronizing signal is lacked, a skew distortion appears on the image screen.The continuity of the chrominance signal is discussed below. In the PAL SECAM signal, the chrominance signal is switched for each line. In the PAL system, the phase of the carrier wave for the R Y signal is reversed for each line, and in the SECAM system the R Y signal and the B Y signal are alternately transmitted for each line. Accordingly, if the sequence of the chrominance signals is reversed in the middle or the beginning of a field, a chrominance discrimination circuit of a television receiver operates improperly or takes long time for pull in so that the color does not appear on the picture image or color phase is disturbed in the middle or top of the picture image. The above five cases are discussed for aVTR for the recorded pattern shown in Fig. 1. Since one field is recorded in each track in the recorded pattern of Fig. 1, the number tH of lines recorded in one track is equal to 312.5. In the case 1 and 5 , since the horizontal synchronizing signals and the chrominance signals are arranged side by sides in the recorded pattern, the continuity of the horizontal synchronizing signal and the continuity of the chrominance signal are maintained. In the case 2 , since the switching of the heads is effected in the exactly same manner as the normal reproduction mode, the continuity of the horizontal synchronizing signal p. and the continuity of the chrominance signal are maintained. In the case 3 , the signal reproduced in the switching of the heads is skipped by two tracks plus 2 aH lines. In the jump from II A to III B in Fig. 3, the tracks II B and III A, and the lines II 312 andII 313 1 2 line of the track II A and the lines III313 1 2 line and III 314 of the track III B are skipped so that the line is jumped from the line II 311 to the line III 315. Accordingly, the total number of lines skipped is equal to 2 tH 2 aH 628 where aH 1.5 tH 312.5 .Since this number is an even number, the continuity of the horizontal synchronizing signal and the continuity of the chrominance signal are maintained. In the case 4 , in the switching of the heads, the signal reproduced is jumped one track behind and 2 aH lines behind. In the jump from II A to I B in Fig. 2, it jumps from the line II 314 in the track II A to the line I 312 in the track I B. That is, it jumps back by 2 tH 2 aH 628 lines. In the jump from the track II B to the track II A in Fig. 4, it also jumps back by 2 tH 2 a H 628 lines. Since those numbers are even, the continuity of the horizontal synchronizing signal and the continuity of the chrominance signal are maintained. Thus, in the VTR for the recorded pattern as shown in Fig. 1, the continuity of the horizontal synchronizing signal and the continuity of the chrominance signal are always maintained even in the p special reproduction mode. Referring to Fig. 5, a basic block diagram for the signal processing of the VHS system PAL SECAM signal VTR is briefly explained. In Fig. 5, numeral 1 denotes a video signal input terminal, 2 a low pass filter, 3 a band pass filter, 4 a frequency modulator, 5 a frequency converter, 6 an adder, 7 a head, 8 a high pass filter, 9 a low pass filter, 10 a frequency demodulator, 11 a frequency converter, 12 an adder and 13 a video signal output terminal. A video signal applied to the input terminal 1 is fed to the low pass filter 2 and the band pass filter 3 where it is divided into a brightness signal and a carrier chrominance signal. The brightness signal is frequency modulated in the frequency modulator 4 and then fed to the adder 6.On the other hand, the carrier chrominance signal is converted to a low frequency signal in the frequency converter 5 and it is superimposed on the frequency modulated wave in the adder 6 for recording on a tape by the head 7. During the low frequency conversion, the signal is processed in accordance with the PAL system or the SECAM system. The signal reproduced by the head 7 is fed to the high pass filter 8 and the low pass filter 9 where it is separated to a frequency modulated wave of the brightness signal and a low frequency converted carrier chrominance signal. The frequency modulated wave is fed to the frequency demodulator 10 where it is demodulated to produce a reproduced brightness signal, which is fed to the adder 12. On the other hand, the low frequency converted carrier chrominance signal is reconverted to the initial frequency signal by the frequency converter 11 and it is combined with the reproduced brightness signal in the adder 12 to reproduce a video signal at the output terminal 13. In the course of reconverting the carrier chrominance signal to the original frequency signal in the frequency converter 11, the signal is processed in accordance with the PAL system or the SECAM system. The present invention provides a method for maintaining the continultles of the horizontal synchronizing signal and the chrominance signal in the special reproduction mode by increasing the density of the pattern shown in Fig. 1 or changing it to a different pattern. As explained in conjunction with Figs. 2 to 4, there are five cases in which the discontinuity of the signal may occur in the special reproduction mode. The a H and the continuities of the horizontal synchronizing signal and the chrominance signal for a given pattern are explained for each of the above cases. In the case 1 , in the switching of the track, the signal jumps 2 tH 2 a H lines ahead. In the case 5 , it jumps 2 tH 2 aH lines behind. In the switching of the head, in the case 2 , the signal jumps in the exactly same manner as the normal reproduction mode so that the continuities of the horizontal synchronizing signal and the chrominance signal are maintained for any pattern.In the case of 3 , the signal jumps 2 tH 2 aH lines ahead, and in the case of 4 it jumps 2 tH 2 aH lines behind. Accordingly, the requirement for the continuity of the horiontal synchronizing signal under those conditions is that the number of lines skipped ahead or behind is an integer, that is, 2 tH 2 a H is an integer That is, tH aH k 2 where k is an integer In the system in which one field is recorded in each track, aH n 2 where n is an integer The requirement for the continuity of the chrominance signal is that 2 tH 2 a H is an even number, that is, tH a H is an integer.That is, t a H k where k is an integer In the system in which one field is recorded in each track, aH 2n 1 2 where n is an integer When tH aH 2k 1 2, the continuity of the horizontal synchronizing signal is maintained in the special reproduction mode although the continuity of the chrominance signal is not maintained, and the compensation for the discontinuity of the chrominance signal in the special reproduction mode is relatively easy to attain. When tH aK 2k 1 2 and the one field per track recording system is used, aH n where n is an integer . Thus, in the one field per track recording system, if a recording density is increased over that of the recorded pattern shown in Fig. 1, a pattern which can maintain the continuities of the horizontal synchronizing signal and the chrominance signal in the special reproduction mode is obtained only when a11 0.5. In the case of a H 0.5, however, the tape speed is 7.8 mm second and the track pitch Tp is 16 um, which extremely degrade the qualities of sound and picture.On the other hand, when aH 1.0 the tape speed is 15.6 mm second and the track pitch T is 32 ism , the p requirement for the continuity of the horizontal synchronizing signal in the special reproduction mode is met but the requirement for the continuity of the chrominance signal is not met. This equally applies to the cases where a H is an integer. The present invention provides a method for maintaining the continuities of the horizontal synchronizing signal and the chrominance signal in the special reproduction mode for any recorded pattern in which tH a H f k. Specifically described below in a method for maintaining the continuity in the one field per track recording system for the pattern of a H n where n is an integer including the case of aH 1.0 and any , pattern of aH n 2 including the case of aH 0.75 Cwhere the tape speed is reduced to one half for high density recording. In the following description, the one field per track recording system is considered unless otherwise specified. An example of the occurrence of the discontinuity of the horizontal synchronizing signal and the chrominance signal is now explained for the case of aH 0.75. Fig. 6 shows a recorded pattern where a H 0.75. In Fig. 6, the tracks, the lines and the chrominance signals are designated in the same manner as in Fig. 1. Figs. 7, 8 and 9 show the loci of the head in the still reproduction mode, the fast forward reproduction mode and the reverse reproduction mode, respectively, for the recorded pattern shown in Fig. 6.Figs. 10, 11 and 12 show the sequences of the horizontal synchronizing signals and the chrominance signals, and the reproduced envelope waveform, in the still reproduction mode, the fast forward reproduction mode and the reverse reproduction mode, respectively. Figs. 7, 8 and 9 correspond to Figs. 2, 3 and 4, respectively, where alpha H 1.5 and the symbols designate in the same way. In the recorded pattern where aH f n 2, the continuities of the horizontal synchronizing signal and the chrominance signal are not maintained in the special reproduction mode except the case 2 . Those special reproduction modes are considered with reference toFigs. 7 to 12.The case of 1 of the special reproduced tion mode corresponds to the fast forward reproduction mode in Figs. 8 and 11 in which the head A moves from the hatched track I A to the track II A at point a in Fig. 11 and the head B moves from the tac track III B to ne track IV B Cat point b in Fig. 11 . In this case, since the horizontal synchronizing signals and the chrominance signals are not arranged side by side, respectively, in the tracks A and in the tracks B, the discontinuities occur. The number of lines skipped at the discontinuity point is equal to 2 tH 2 a11 626.5 where aH 0.75 and tH 312.5 as described above. At the point a inFig. 11, the skip occurs from the middle of the line I 3 CR to the middle of the line II 4 R , and at the point b the skip occurs from the middle of the lineIII 622 B to the middle of the line IV 623 B . The space between the horizontal synchronizing signals in the skip is equal to 0.5 H where H is a unit of line period . As to the chrominance signals, they are spaced by 0.5 H at the point a where the skip occurs from the line I 2 CB to the line II 5 B , and spaced by 0.5 H at the point b where the skip occurs from the lineIII 621 R to the line IV 624 R .In any case, the chrominance signal after the discontinuity point is in advance by 0.5 H retarded by 1.5 H with respect to the chrominance signal before the discontinuity signal, to compare with the case where the continuity is maintained.The case 3 corresponds to a switching point point c in Fig. 11 from the locus II A of the head A to the locus III B of the head 3 in Figs. 8 and 11. In this case, the number of lines skipped is 525.5 lines C 2 tH 2 aH, where a H 0.75 and tH 312.5 or those lines from the last one quarter of the line II 312 to the first one quarter of the line III 314. Thus, like the case 1 above, the discontinuity takes place. At the point c where the skip occurs from the end of the line II 311 to the beginning of the line III 315, the horizontal synchronizing signals are spaced by 1.5 H and the chrominance signals are spaced by 1.5 H in the course of the skip from B to R.Again, like the case 1 above, the chrominance signal after the discontinuity point is advanced by 0.5 H retarded by 1.5 H with respect to the chrominance signal before the discontinuity point, to compare with the case where the continuity is maintained. The case 4 corresponds to the switching point point d in Fig. 10 from the locus II A of the head A to the locus I B of the head B in Figs. 7 and 10. In this case, the skip occurs from the one quarter point of the line II 314 back to the three quarter point of the line I 312, that is, the number of lines skipped back is 626.5 lines 2 tH 2 aH, where a H 0.75 and tH 312.5 .At the point d where the skip occurs from the end of the line II 313 to the beginning of the line I 313, the horizontal synchronizing signals are spaced by 0.5 H and the chrominance signals are spaced by 0.5 H in the course of the skip p. from B to R. The chrominance signal after the discontinuity point is advanced by 1.5 H retarded by 0.5 H with respect to the chrominance signal before the discontinuity signal, to compare with the case where the continuity is maintained. The case 5 above corresponds to the switch at point e in Fig. 12 from the locus IV A of the head A to the locus III A, the switch from the locus II A to the locus I A and the switch at point f in Fig. 12 from the locus III B of the head B to the locus IT B, in Figs. 9 and 12. Like the case 4 above, the discontinuity occurs.At the point e where the switch occurs from the end of the line IV 311 to the beginning of the line III 312, the horizontal synchronizing signals are spaced by 1.5 H and the chrominance signals are spaced by 1.5 H in the course of the switch from B to B. Again, like in the case 4 above, the chrominance signal after the discontinuity point is advanced by 1.5 H retarded by 0.5 H with respect to the chrominance signal after the discontinuity point, to compare with the case where the continuity is maintained. The same is true for the point f. The conditions at the discontinuity point discussed above may be generalized as follows. When the number of lines included in one track is given by tH CtH 312.5 in the previous examples , 2 tH aH lines are skipped forward in the cases 1 and 3 of the special reproduction mode, and 2 tH aH lines are p skipped backward in the cases 4 and 5 . If the number 2CtH a of lines skipped forward or backward is an integer, the horizontal synchronizing signal is continuous at that point, and if it is an even number the chrominance signal is also continuous.Accordingly, the cases 1 and 3 are equivalent to the case where the horizontal synchronizing signal is skipped by 2 tH a m lines Cwhere m is an integer at the track switching point and the chrominance signal is skipped by 2 tH aH 2Q lines where Q is an integer .The case 4 is equivalent to the case where the horizontal synchronizing signal is skipped back by 2ctH aH m lines and the chrominance signal is skipped back by 2CtH a 2Q lines. This means that in the cases 1 and 3 the horizontal synchronizing signal after the discontinuity point is advanced by 2CtH aH m lines with respect to the horizontal synchronizing signal before the discontinuity point and the chrominance signal after the discontinuity signal is advanced by 2 tH QH 2Z lines.For the cases 4 and 5 , it means that the signals after the discontinuity point are retarded by 2 tH alpha H m lines for the horizontal synchronizing signal and by 2 tH a11 2Q lines for the chrominance signal, with respect to the signals before the discontinuity point.When this is applied to the case where a H 0.75, 2 tH alpha H is equal to 626.5 and assuming that m 626 and 2l 626, the horizontal synchronizing signal is advanced by 0.5 H and the chrominance signal is advanced by 0.5 H after the discontinuity point in the cases 1 and 3 , and the horizontal signal is retarded by 0.5 H and the chrominance signal is retarded by 0.5 H after the discontinuity point in the cases 4 and 5 . This corresponds to the results obtained above. Considering a pattern where a11 5 6, 2 tH aH is equal to 525 2 3. When m 625 and 2l 626, the horizontal synchronizing signal and the chrominance signal advance by C2 3 H after the discontinuity point .in the cases 1 and 3 , and they reatrd by 2 3 H in the cases 4 and 5 . In the pattern in which a11 1.0, 2 tH aH is equal to 627 and assuming that m 627 and 2l 626, the horizontal synchronizing signal is advanced by zeroH that is, the continuity is not destroyed and the chrominance signal is advanced by 1.0 H after the discontinuity point in the cases 1 and 3 , and the horizontal synchronizing signal is retarded by zero H that is, the discontinuity is not destroyed and the chrominance signal is retarded by 1.0 H after the discontinuity point in the cases 4 and 5 . Thus, when a H 0.75, the horizontal synchro . nizing signal and the chrominance signal are advanced by 0.5 H after the discontinuity point in the cases 1 and 3 . Accordingly, the continuity is maintained by delaying the both signals after the discontinuity point by 0.5 H. In the cases 4 and 5 , both signals are retarded by 0.5 H. Accordingly, the continuity is maintained by advancing the both signals after the discontinuity point by 0.5 H. When aH 5 6, the continuity of both signals is maintained by retarding both signals after the discontinuity point by 2 3 H in the cases 1 and 3 and advancing both signals after the discontinuity point by 2 3 H in the cases 4 and 5 .When a H 1.0, 0 the continuity of the horizontal synchronizing signal is not lost in any case of the cases 1 , 3 , 4 and 5 . Accordingly, the continuity is maintained by retarding only the chrominance signal by 1.0 H in the cases 1 and 3 and also retarding it by 1.0 H which is equivalent to advance by 1.0 H in the cases 14 and 5 . Based on the consideration given above, the present invention provides a method for maintaining the continuities of the horizontal synchronizing signal and the chrominance signal in the special reproduction mode for patterns of any aH where tH aH f k. One embodiment where aH 0.75 is shown in Fig. 13 and waveforms in the circuit of Fig. 13 are shown in Fig. 14. InFig. 13, numerals 1 13 denote the same elements as those shown in Fig. 5 and they function in the same manner.Numeral 14 denotes a 0.5 H delay line, 15 a switch, 16 a 0.5 H delay line, 17 a 1.0 H delay line, 18 a 1.5 H delay line, 19 a switch, 20 an envelope detector, 21 a pulse generator, 22 and 23 flip flops, and 24 a reproduction mode identification signal input p.terminal. Numerals 25 29 2 of the signal waveforms shown in Fig. 14 correspond to the numerals shown in Fig. 13. The waveforms 29 1 and 29 2 correspond to the waveform 29 in the fast forward reproduction mode and the slow, still and reverse reproduction modes, respectively. The reproduce and demodulated brightness signal Cthe output signal of the frequency demodulator 105 is applied to terminals a and a2 of the switch 15 directly and through the 0.5 H delay line 14, respectively.On the other hand, the reproduced chrominance signal which has been reconverted to the original frequency the output signal of the frequency converter 11 is applied to terminals bl, b2, b3 and b of the switch 19 directly and through the C.5 , . delay line 16, the 1.0 H delay line 17 and the 1.5 H delay line 13, respectively.The switches 15 and 19 are controlled by the output signals of the flip flops 22 and 23. The brightness signal at the output of the switch 15 and the chrominance signal at the output of the switch 19 are combined in the adder 12 which produces a reproduced video signal at the output terminal 13. As shown in Figs. 10 12, the envelope of the reproduced signal falls at the points where the discontinuity of the horizontal synchronizing signal and the chrominance signal occur in the special reproduction mode. Accordingly, by applying the reproduced signal 25 from the head 7 to the envelope detector 20 and detecting the envelope, the signal 26 is produced.The signal 26 is then fed to,the pulse generator 21 which produces pulse signals 27 which indicate the falling points of the envelope, that is, the discontinuity points of the horizontal synchronizing signal and the chrominance signal. The signals 27 are applied to the flip flop 22 which produces a switching control signal 28 which in turn is fed to the flip flop 23, which produces a switching control signal 29. The switch 15 is controlled by the signal 28 so that it selects the terminal a1 when the signal 28 is LOW and the terminal a2 when the signal 28 is HIGH. The switch 19 is controlled by the signals 28 and 29 so that is selects the terminals in the following manner.EMI20.1 tb Signal SEP 28 SEP Signal SEP 29 SEP Terminal SEP Selected tb SEP LOW SEP LOW SEP b1 tb SEP HIGH SEP LOW SEP b2 tb SEP LOW SEP HIGH SEP b3 tb SEP HIGH SEP HIGH tb applied to the terminal 24 is a signal for identifying 1 normal reproduction mode, 2 fast forward reproduction mode and 3 slow motion, still and reverse reproduction mode. The flip flops 22 and 23 are controlled such that the signals 28 and 29 are bothLOW in the normal reproduction mode 1 , the signals 28 and 29 have a relationship as shown by 29 1 in Fig.14 the flip flop 23 is driven by the fall of the signal 28 in 2 fast forward reproduction mode 2 , and the signals 28 and 29 have a relationship as shown by 29 2 in Fig. 14 the flip flop 23 is driven by thg rise of the signal 28 in the slow, still and reverse reproduction mode 3 . Thus, in the normal reproduction mode 1 , the switch 15 always selects the terminal a1 and the switch 19 always selects the terminal b1 so that the exactly same reproduced video signal as that in the case of Fig. 5 is produced at the output terminal 13. In the fast forward reproduction mode 2 , the switches 15 and 19 selects the terminals in a manner shown in the table below during the periods 30 34 shown in Fig. 14.EMI21.1 tb SEP Switch SEP 15 SEP Switch SEP 1 SEP tb Period SEP Brightness SEP Signal SEP Chrominance SEP Signal tb SEP Delay SEP Delay tb SEP 30 SEP al SEP O SEP bl SEP 0 tb SEP 31 SEP a2 SEP 0.5 SEP H SEP b2 SEP 0.5 SEP H tb SEP 32 SEP al SEP O SEP b3 SEP 1.0 SEP H tb SEP 33 SEP a2 SEP 0.5 SEP H SEP b4 SEP 1.5 SEP H tb SEP 34 SEP al SEP 0 SEP bl SEP 0 tb Thus, at every discontinuity point, the brightness signal is delayed by 0.5 H 1 H delay being equivalent to zero delay and the chrominance signal is delayed by 0.5 H 2 H delay being equivalent to zero delay .In the cases 1 and 3 of the special reproduction mode where ah 0.75, the horizontal synchronizing signal is advanced by 0.5 H and the chrominance signal is advanced by 0.5 H at every discontinuity point and the discontinuity point in the fast forward reproduction mode corresponds to the case 1 or case 3 . Accordingly, the continuities of the horizontal synchronizing signal and the chrominance signal can be maintained by the switching operation described above. In the slow, still and reverse reproduction mode 3 , the switches 15 and 19 select the terminals in a manner shown in the table below during the periods 30 34 shown in Fig. 114.

Accordingly, the continuities of the horizontal synchronizing signal and the chrominance signal can be maintained by the switching operation described above. Thus, proper horizontaal synchronizing signal and proper chrominance signal can be reproduced in any case of, the special reproduction mode. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 13, the brightness signal is delayed by zero or 0.5 H and the chrominance signal is delayed by 0, 0.5 H, 1.0 H or 1.5 H. The brightness signal may be delayed an integer multiple of H more and the chrominance signal may be delayed an integer multiple of 2 H more. Alternatively, .the delays may be such that the relative delays in the periods 30 34 meet the requirement that a difference of delay between the brightness signal and the chrominance signal is equal to an integer multiple of 1 H e.g. the brightness signal is delayed by 0.3 H and 0.8 H or an integer multiple of 1 H more and the chrominance signal is delayed by 0.3 H, 0.8 H, 1.3 H and 1.8 H or an integer multiple of 2 H more .When the delays of the brightness signal and the chrominance signal are equal, vertical offset of the brightness signal and the chrominance signal is eliminated. The positions at which the brightness signal and the chrominance signal are delayed need not be limited to those shown in Fig. 13. The brightness signal may be delayed at the input or the output of the high pass filter 8 or it may be delayed by modulating the demodulated signal with a high frequency signalAlternatively, the brightness signal and the chrominance p signal may be simultaneously delayed at the output of the head 7, or the demodulated brightness signal and the frequency reconverted chrominance signal may be combined in the adder 12 and the cqmbined signal may be delayed directly or after being modulated with a high frequency signal , or a portion of the brightness signal and the chrominance signal may be delayed and the portion of the chrominance signal may be further delayed. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 13, the case where aH 0.75 is considered. The present invention is applicable to any aH tH aH k so long as the delays of the brightness signal and the chrominance signal and the switching operation of the delays are properly selected. For example, for the pattern where aH 5 6, the switching operation may be carried out in the manner shown in Fig. 15. In Fig. 15, numerals 10 13, 21 and 24 denote the same elements as those shown in Fig. 13. Numeral 35 denotes a 2 3 H delay line and numeral 36 denotes a 1 3 H delay line. They correspond to the delay line 14 shown in Fig. 13. Numeral 37 denotes a switch which corresponds to the switch 15. Numeral 38 denotes a 2 3 H delay line and numeral 39 denotes a 4 3 H delay line. They correspond to the delay lines 18. Numeral 40 denotes a switch which corresponds to the switch 19. Numeral 41 denotes a counter which corresponds to the flip flops 22 and 23. As described above, when aH 5 6, the horizontal synchronizing signal and the chrominance signal are advanced by 2 3 H at every discontinuity point in the fast forward reproduction mode.Accordingly, by selecting the terminals of the switches 37 and 40 in the sequence of 1 02, 3 c1 ... and dl, d2, d3, d1 . by the output signals of the counter 41, the horizontal synchronizing signal and the chrominance signal which are continuous to the outputs of the switches can be produced. In the slow, still and reverse reproduction modes, the signals are retarded by 2 3 H at every discontinuity point. Accordingly, by selecting the terminals of the switches 37 and 40 in the sequence of c1, c2, c3, cl, and dl, d2, d3, d1, ..... by the output signals of the counter 41, the horizontal synchronizing signal and the chrominance signal which are continuous to the outputs of the switches can be produced. In the slow, still and reverse reproduction modes, the signals are delayed by 2 3 H at every discontinuity point. Accordingly, by selecting the terminals of the switches 37 and 40 in the sequence of 3 2 1 c3 ..... and d3, d2, dl, d3 ..... by the 3, output signals of the counter 41, the continuous signals can be produced. The counter 41 is controlled by the reproduction mode identification signal applied to the terminal 24 so that in the normal reproduction mode the switches 37 and 40 always select the control signals at the terminals cl and dl and in the special reproduction mode they select the control signals for effecting the switching operations described above, as the case maw be.When aH 5 6, a modification similar to that described for the case of a H 0.75 is possible. Assuming that the number 9f lines per track is tH for any aH, the switching. in the fast forward reproduction mode may be effected such that the brightness signal is retarded by 2 tH .a m lines and the chrominance signal is retarded by 2 tH a11 2Q lines at every discontinuity point and the switching in the slow, still and reverse reproduction modes may be effected such that the brightness signal is advanced by 2 tH H m lines and chrominance signal is advanced by 2 tH aH 2R1 lines at every discontinuity point. Fig. 16 shows another modification for delaying the signal. In Fig. 16, numerals 10 13, 21, 24 and 41 denote the same elements as those shown inFig. 15. Numerals 42 and 43 denote variable delay lines and numerals 44 and 45 denote control signal generators.In the normal reproduction mode, the counter 41 is controlled by the reproduction mode identification signal applied to the terminal 24 so that the output signals of the control signal generators 44 and 45 function to maintain the delays of the variable delay lines 42 and 43 at zero or constant delays. In the fast forward reproduction mode, the counter 41 responds to the signal applied to the terminal 24 to count up the output signals 27 in Fig. 14 of the pulse generator 21 so that the output signal of the control signal p generator 44 functions to increment the delay of the variable delay line 42 by 2 tH aH m lines each time the pulse generator 21 generates a pulse. The delay may be reset before the delay exceeds 1 H.The output signal of the control signal generator 45 functions to increment the delay of the variable delay line 43 by 2 tH aH 2R1 lines each time the pulse generator 21 generates a pulse. The delay may be reset before the delay exceeds 2 H. In this manner, in the fast forward reproduction mode, the brightness signal is delayed by 2 tH a11 m lines and the chrominance signal is delayed by 2 tH aH 2 lines at every discontinuity point so that the continuous signals are produced at the output terminal 13.In the slow, still and reverse reproduction modes, in response to the signal applied to the terminal 24, the delay of the variable delay line 42 is decremented by 2 tH aH m lines and the delay of the variable delay line 43 is decremented by E2 tH aK 2Q lines each time the pulse generator 21 generates a pulse. In this manner, the continuous signals are produced at the output terminal 13. The explanation set forth above refers to the case where two heads are arranged at the angle of 1800 to each other. When one of the heads is offset from the 1800 line so that the signals on the adjacent two tracks are arranged side by side, the explanation set forth above is equally applicable because the loci p recorded by the head A are reproduced by only the headA and the loci recorded by the head B are reproduced by only the head B. It is also applicable when one of the heads is offset by any angle. Fig. 17 shows a tape pattern when one of the heads is offset from the 1800 line by an angle corresponding to 0.75 H and aH 0.75. The explanation set forth above refers to the patterns where the direction of head rotation in the normal reproduction mode and the direction of tape travel are same. When the directions are opposite to each other, a H is negative and the explanation set forth above is equally applicable. Fig. 18 shows a recorded pattern where aH 1.0. In Fig. 18, numerals of the tracks, lines and chrominance signals represent the same ones as those shown in Fig. 1. Figs. 19, 20 and 21 show head loci for that pattern in the still reproduction mode, fast forward reproduction mode and reverse reproduction mode, respectively, and Figs. 22, 23 and 24 show the positions of the horizontal synchronizing signals, the sequences of the chrominance signals in the horizontal signals and the changes in the envelope waveforms, of the reproduced signals in the still reproduction mode, fast forward reproduction mode and reverse reproduction mode, respectively. They correspond to Figs. 7 9 andFigs. 10 12 where aH 0.75 and the symbols denote the same things.When aH is an integer, the continuity of the horizontal synchronizing signal is always p maintained in the special reproduction mode as seen from the above explanation and the reproduced signal waveforms but the continuity of the chrominance signal is lost in the special reproduction mode except the case 2 . Therefore, the chrominance signal is delayed by 1.0 H or advanced by 1.0 H after the discontinuity point to maintain the continuity. That is, the sequence of the chrominance signal may be reversed after the discontinuity point. Figs. 25 and 26 show block diagrams of an .embodiment where a H 1.0. Numerals 1 13 denote the same elements as those shown in Fig. 5 and they function in the same manner. Therefore, they are not explained here. In Fig. 25, numeral 46 denotes a 1 H delay iine, 47 an envelope detector, 48 a pulse generator, 49 an integrator, 50 an inhibit circuit, 51 a flip flop, 52 a switch and 53 a reproduction mode identification signal input terminal. The operation of the circuit is explained with reference to Fig. 27. In the reproduction operation, the reproduced brightness signal from the frequency demodulator 10 is applied to the adder 12. On the other hand, a portion of the carrier chrominance signal which has been reconverted to the original frequency by the frequency converter 11 is applied to the switch 52 directly. Another portion of the carrier chrominance signal is applied to the switch 21 through the 1H delay line 46.A portion 54 Fig. 27 of the reproduced p carrier signal from the head amplifier is applied to the envelope detector 47 where it is detected to produce the waveform 55, which is then applied to the pulse generator 48, which produces pulses at the minimum points of the envelope, that is, at the points where the reproduced carrier signal disappears so that the waveform 56 is produced as a detection signal which indicates the time points at which the sequence of the chrominance signal changes. The waveforms 56 is applied to the integrator 49 which produces the signal waveform 57. In the reproduction operation, the signal disappears not at only one minimum point of the envelope but the envelope detector senses noises or other affects by transient at the time of the switching of the heads over several to tens horizontal scan periods around the minimum point. AE a result, a number of small pulses are generated around the desired pulse 62. In order to prevent those noise pulses from occurring, the waveform 56 is applied to the integrator 49 which produces a single pulse to prevent the mulfunction in the succeeding stage. The resulting pulse 57 is applied to the inhibit circuit 50 an output of which is applied to the flip flop 51.If the waveform 57 from the integrator 49 is directly applied to the flip flop 51, the flipflop 51 may mulfunction by the affect of the signal 63 which is produced in the waveform 57 by dropout or other disturbance shown by 61 in the waveform 54 .Accordingly, the inhibit circuit 50 is provided to prevent erroneous control signal from being generated.That is during the period 64 in which the inhibit circuit 50 produces the output signal 58, the signal 63 is inhibited from being applied to the flip flop 51.This can te attained by selecting the falling time constant of the monostable multivibrator to an appropriate valve which is related to the cycle of the falling points of the envelope. The signal 59 from the flip flop 51 is utilized as the control signal, which is applied to the switch 52 to alternately select the non delayed main reproduced carrier chrominance signal and the 1 H delayed carrier chrominance signal. After the continuity of the chrominance signal has been corrected in this manner, the chrominance signal is applied to the adder 12 where it is combined with the reproduced brightness signal and the combined signal is produced at the output terminal 13 as the reproduced video signal. The above explanation relates to the special reproduction mode including the still, slow, fast forward and reverse reproduction modes.In the normal reproduction mode, the operation of the flipflop 51 is stopped by the identification signal applied to the reproduction mode identification signal input terminal 53 so that the control signal is not generated and either one of the non delayed main reproduced carrier chrominance signal or the the 1 H delayed carrier chrominance signal is always transmitted. In an embodiment shown in Fig. 26, a dropout compensator 60 is used in place of the envelope detector 47 and the pulse generator 48 shown in Fig. 25 and those pulses of the dropout detection signal which indicates the dropout periods in the dropout compensator 50 which correspond to the portions at which the sequence of the chrominance signals differs are applied to the integrator 49 to correct the sequence of the chrominance signals. The peripheral circuit is identical to that shown in Fig. 25. Referring to Fig. 28, the control signals from the flip flop and the manner in which the actual chrominance signals are arranged in proper continuous sequence are explained. Fig. 28 illustrates the case of fast forward reproduction mode shown in Fig. 23. The operation is similar for the other special reproduction mode. The waveform 65 shows the change of envelope of the reproduced carrier. At the portions a, c, b and g at which the sequence of the chrominance signals differs, that is, at the falling points of the envelope waveform, the control signal 66 is produced from the flip flop as explained above. The chrominance signal sequence for the non delayed main reproduced carrier chrominance signal is shown by 67, the chrominance signal sequence for the 1 H delayed carrier chrominance signal is shown by 68, and the carrier chrominance signal output 1 which has been corrected for the chrominance signal sequence is shown by 69. The carrier p chrominance signal output 1 69 is explained below.Let us assume that the main signal is selected until the first discontinuity point a, the delayed signal is then selected until the second discontinuity point c, the main signal is then selected until the third disconti nuity point b, the delayed signal is then selected until the fourth discontinuity point 9 and thereafter the signals are alternately selected. The requirement for the continuity of the chrominance signal sequence is that either odd numbered lines or the even numbered lines in the overall stream of the chrominance signal sequence are fixed to either R or B such as R, B, R, B,R, B, ,.... for each line.Accordingly, assuming that the line including the first discontinuity point a isR and the line including the point a is B, the chrominance signal sequence around that meets the requirement for the continuity of the chrominance signal. Actually, the line including the point a and the line including the point a include information of both R and B and hence proper color phase does not appear on the television. However, since this occurs only for two line periods and it is of no problem when it is visually sensed. The lines including the second discontinuity point c are both B and the chrominance signal sequence of the lines around those lines is also proper. Assuming that the line including the third discontinuity point b is R and the line including the point b is B, it meets the requirement like in the p case of the first discontinuity point.Although the color phase is abnormal for only two line periods, it does not pose a problem. The lines including the fourth discontinuity point C are both B and the chrominance signal sequence around those lines are proper. As described above, the chrominánce signal sequence is continuous as a whole although the lines of abnormal color phase are partially included. The carrier chrominance signal output 2 designated 70 shows a case where the relationship between the control signal and the switching is opposite to that of 69.The delayed signal is selected until the first discontinuity point a, the main signal is then selected until the second discontinuity point c, the delayed signal is then selected until the third discontinuity point b and the main signal is then selected until the fourth discontinuity point 9 and thereafter the signals are alternately selected. In the period including the discontinuity point a, both lines are B and the chrominance signal sequence around those lines is proper. Assuming that the line including the second discontinuity point c is R and the line including the point c is B, the sequence is proper except the abnormal color phase for only two line periods as is the case for the output signal 1. The lines including the third discontinuity point b are both B and the chrominance signal sequence around those lines are proper.Assuming that the line including the fourth p discontinuity point 9 is R and the line including thd point g is B, the sequence is proper except the abnormality in only two line periods. If the output of.the control signal should be reversed or the switch should be operated reversely by some reason, it does not raise a problem whether the beginning of the chrominance signal sequence is the primary signal or the delayed signal because the operation by the carrier chrominance signal output 2 70 is corrected in the same manner as in the operation by the carrier chrominance signal output 1 69 . While the fast forward reproduction mode has been explained above, the correction can be made in the still reproduction mode of Fig. 22 and the reverse reproduction mode ofFig. 24 so that the carrier chrominance signal having the continuous chrominance signal sequence can be produced. In the embodiment explained above, the main signal is directly applied while the delayed signal is delayed by one horizontal scan period. Since the chrominance signal sequence does not change when the carrier chrominance signal is delayed by an even multiple of one horizontal scan period, the delayed signal may be delayed longer than the above period by an even multiple of one horizontal scan period. Alternatively, both carrier chrominance signals may be delayed such that a difference between the delay times is equal to an odd multiple of one horizontal scan period.For example, p the main signal may be delayed by one horizontal scan period and the delayed signal may be delayed by two horizontal scan periods, or the main signal may be delayed by two horizontal scan periods while the delayed signal may be delayed by one horizontal scan cycle. In this manner, when the time difference between the two carrier chrominance signals selected is equal to an odd multiple of one horizontal scan period, the carrier chrominance signal having the continuous chrominance signal sequence can be produced.When the two heads are not arranged along the 1800 line but one of the heads is offset from the 1800 line so that the signals only on the two adjacent tracks are arranged side by side, the above explanation is equally applicable because the loci recorded by the head A are reproduced only by the head A and the loci recorded by the head B are reproduced only by the head B. The above explanation is also applicable when one of the heads is offset by any angle. The discontinuity point in the special reproduction mode can be detected by the envelope detection or the output of the dropout compensator, or both of them, as described above. For a PAL system VTR, it may be detected by an APC error signal from an APC circuit and an AFC output signal. This will be explained below.This is also applicable to a pattern of a11 n 2 including aH 0.75 and a pattern of ash n including aH 1.0. p In the PAL system color television signal recording and reproducing apparatus, the APC error signal which is generated by the APC circuit which is one of the chrominance signal processing circuits is positive or negative when the phase of R Y signal is positive CR signal and negative or positive when the phase of the R Y signal is positive B signal . Thus, the polarity of the error signal changes depending on whether the R Y signal is R signal or B signal.During the period in which the chrominance signal sequence is .continuous, the APC error signal becomes alternately positive and negative, and at the discontinuity point of the chrominance signal the R signal follows to theR signal or the Signal follows to the B signal and the positive APC error signal follows to the positiveAPC error signal or the negative APC signal follows to the negative APC error signal. Thus, the signals of the same polarity are produced continuously. In the present embodiment, the discontinuity of the chrominance signal sequence is detected by theAPC error signal to effect the reversal operation described above in order to correct the chrominance signal sequence and reproduce stable chrominance signal. Fig. 29 shows a block diagram of one embodiment where aH n. Numerals 1 13 denote the same elements as those shown in Fig. 5 and hence they are not explained here. Numeral 46 denotes a 1 H delay line, 52 a switch, 71 an APC circuit, 72 a wave reformer, 73 an AFC circuit, 74 a gate signal generator, 75 a gate circuit, 76 an integration hold circuit, 77 a wave reformer and 78 a horizontal synchronizing signal input terminal. The operation is now explained with reference to waveforms shown in Fig. 30. The reproduced brightness signal from the frequency demodulator 10 is applied to the adder 12. On the other hand, a portion of the reproduced carrier chrominance signal which has been reconverted to the original frequency by the frequency converter 11 is applied directly to one contact of the switch 52 and another portion of the reproduced carrier chrominance signal is applied to the other contact of the switch 52 through the 1 H delay line 46. The reproduced carrier chrominance signal not passed through the 1 H delay line 46 is called a main carrier chrominance signal and the reproduced carrier chrominance signal passed through the 1 H delay line 46 is called a delayed carrier chrominance signal.One of the main carrier chrominance signal and the delayed carrier chrominance signal is selected by the switch 52 and the selected signal is applied to the adder 12 where it is combined with the reproduced brightness signal and the combined signal is produced at the output terminal 13 as a reproduced video signal. The control signals for controlling the switch 52 are generated in the following manner.Assuming that the reproduced carrier chrominance p signal shown by 301 in Fig. 30 is produced from the frequency converter 11 in the special reproduction mode, it is also applied to the APC, circuit 71 In the APC error signal 302 in Fig. 30 produced by the APC circuit, the pulses of the same polarity appear continuously at the discontinuity points hand i in Fig. 30 of the chrominance signal, as explained above. The resulting APC error signal 302 in Fig. 30 is applied to the wave reformer 72 where it is converted to a stable square wave as shown by 303 in Fig. 30 and the .square wave is then applied to the gate circuit 75.On the other hand, the AFC output signal 304 in Fig. 30 which is in synchronism with the horizontal synchronizing signal and produced by the AFC circuit 73 which is controlled by the reproduced horizontal synchronizing signal applied to the terminal 78 is applied to the gate signal generator 74, which generates a gate signal 305 in Fig. 30 having width and timing which are sufficient to gate the pulse portion of the reformed signal 303 in Fig. 30 of the APC error signal at one horizontal scan period interval. The gate signal generator 74 may be flip flops or monostable multivibrators or any other appropriate elements. The resulting gate signal t305 in Fig. 30 is applied to the gate circuit 75, which gates the pulse portion of the reformed signal 303 in Fig. 30 .The gated output signal 306 in Fig. 30 is applied to the integration hold circuit 76 which produce the hold signal 307 in, Fig. 30 , which is then applied to the wave reformer 77 to produce the control signal 308 in Fig. 30 . The polarity of the control signal 308 in Fig. 30 is reversed each time the discontinuity point of the chrominance signal appears. The control signal 308 inFig. 30 functions in the same manner as the control signal 59 Fig. 25 in the previous embodiment. Accordingly, the carrier chrominance signal having the continuous chrominance signal sequence can be produced in the still, slow, fast forward and reverse reproduction mode. In the normal operation mode, the switch 52 is controlled such that only one of the main carrier chrominance signal and the delayed carrier chrominance signal is selected. Fig. 31 shows a block diagram of another embodiment which uses the APC error signal and the AFC output signal. The numerals 1 13 denote the same elements as those shown in Fig. 5 and hence they are not explained here. Numeral 46 denotes a 1 H delay line, 52 a switch, 71 an APC circuit, 79 a wave reformer, 78 a reproduced horizontal synchronizing signal input terminal, 73 an AFC circuit, 80 a data signal generator and 81 a D type flip flop. The operation is now explained with reference to the waveforms shown in Fig. 32. The reproduced brightness signal from the frequency demodulator 10 is applied to the adder 12. On the other hand, a portion of the reproduced carrier chrominance signal which has p been reconverted to the original frequency by the frequency converter 11 is applied directly to the switch 52 and another portion of the reproduced carrier chrominance signal is applied. to the switch 52 after having been delayed by one horizontal scan period by the 1 H delay line 46.The reproduced carrier chrominance signal not passed through the 1 H delay line 46 is called the main carrier chrominance signal and the reproduced carrier chrominance signal passed through the 1 H delay line 46 is called the delayed carrier chror,,i nance signal. Either one of the main carrier chrominance signal or the delayed carrier chrominance signal is selected by the switch 52 and the selected signal is applied to the adder 12 and the combined signal is produced at the output terminal 13 as a reproduced video signal. The control signal for controlling the switch 52 is generated in the following manner. Assuming that the reproduced carrier chrominance signal as shown by 321 in Fig. 32 is produced by the frequency converter 11 in the special reproductibn mode, it is also applied to the APC circuit 71. In the APC error signal 322 in Fig. 32 produced by the APC circuit 71, the error signals of the same polarity appear continuously at the discontinuity ponts h and i in Fig. 32 of the chrominance signal, as described above. The resulting APC error signal t322 in Fig. 32 is applied to the wave reformer 79, which converts it to a stable square wave clock signal having only positive polarity edges of the error signal as shown by 323 in Fig. 32.The square wave is then applied to a clock input terminal of the D type flip flop 81 a square wave having negative edges may be used . On the other hand, the signal 324 in Fig. 32 which is in synchronism with the horizontal synchronizing signal and produced by theAFC circuit 73 which is controlled by the reproduced horizontal synchronizing signal applied to the terminal78 is applied to the data signal generator 80, which generates a data signal 325 in Fig. 32 having width and timing which are sufficient to be read by the clock signal t323 in Fig. 32 and which is generated at two horizontal scan period interval. The data signal may be generated by flip flops or monostable multivibrators.The generated data signal 325 in Fig. 32 is applied to a data inpu terminal of the D type flip flop 81 so that data is read by the clock signal 323 in Fig. 32 . The resulting output signal is used as the control signal. In the D type flip flop 81, if the data isHIGH level when the data signal 325 in Fig. 32 in read by the clock signal 323 in Fig. 32 , the flipflop output is HIGH level and the initial data is retained irrespective of the input data signal until the next clock signal is applied, and if the data when the next clock signal is applied is HIGH level the output remains HIGH level and if the data is LOW level the output changes to LOW level and this output is retained until the next clock signal is applied. When.the clock signal shown by 323 in Fig. 32 and the data signal shown by 325 in Fig. 32 are used, the output signal control signal of the flip flop 81 appears as shown by 326 in Fig. 32. While the D type flip flop is used in the present embodiment to generate the control signal, any other means may be used so long as the data signal is read by the clock signal, the output is produced in accordance with the data signal, and the output does not change between one clock and the next clock irrespective of the input data signal and the initial output Is retained. The resulting control signal C326 in PIg. 32 controls the switch 52 as do the signal 308 in Fig. 30 and the signal 59 in Fig. 25 to produce the continuous carrier chrominance s a in the special reproductIon mode.Various methods for detecting the discontInuity point are available as described above and combination of those methods may be employed to enhance the accuracy. While the delay lines are primarily used as the delay elements in the embodiments described above, other delay elements such as CCD may be used. As described herein above, according to the present invention, the higher recording density than in the conventional recording and reproducing apparatus can be attained in the PAL or SECAM color television signal recording and reproducing apparatus, and high quality of color video signal and very stable television image can be produced in the normal reproduction mode as well in any case of the special reproduction mode including the still, slow, fast forward including faster case than the illustrated embodiment and reverse including faster reverse mode than the illustrated embodiment reproduction modes.
