# Side lobe suppressing unit for a pulse radar apparatus.

## Abstract
In a pulse radar apparatus the receiver comprises a main transmission channel 1 connected to a directional antenna 3 and an interference canceller 2 connected to said channel 1 for selecting target returns obtained through the major lobe of the antenna radiation pattern. The canceller 2 contains an auxiliary transmission channel 5 connected to an omnidirectional antenna 7 for the intermediate frequency detection of target returns and of signals com posed of noise and or continuous wave interference signals a subtraction unit 14 and a phase and amplitude compensating network 6 having two circuit arrangements 17 and 23 , one for the in phase output signal and one for the quadrature output signal of the auxiliary transmission channel 5 for generating output signals for the subtraction unit 14 . Each circuit arrangement 17 and 23 consists of a first mixer 18 connected to the subtraction unit 17 and the auxiliary transmission channel 5 , a filter 20 connected to the first mixer 18 , and a second mixer 22 connected to the filter 20 and the auxiliary transmission channel 5 .
