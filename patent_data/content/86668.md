# IMPROVED VEHICLE ROOF INSTALLATION

## Abstract
A vehicle roof cover 1 is formed as a suitably contoured and dimensioned polymer sheet e.g. of glass reinforced plastic and not as hitherto in a thin vinyl layer. It is thick enough to accept suitable shaping to remove undesired features of the underlying panel whether of accident or design or to add de sired features or surface finish of expensive appearance. It may be used for customising or damage repair in a valuable form of the invention the sheet 1 is apertured at 2 to accept a sun roof panel operable by a mechanism mounted on the sheet, and not directly on the vehicle roof panel of possibly unsuitable conformation.
