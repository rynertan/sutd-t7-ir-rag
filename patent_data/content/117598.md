# Method and apparatus for determining the image transfer quality of an imaging system.

## Abstract
A method of, and apparatus for, determining the image transfer quality of an imaging system on the basis of the sig nal to noise ratio. A reference pattern comprising at least two different portions is presented to an input of the system. One portion provides a television output signal which is a measure for the noise, and another portion provides a tele vision output signal comprising the same amount of noise in a combination with an image signal component. The tele vision output signals are compared to determine the signal to noise ratio.
