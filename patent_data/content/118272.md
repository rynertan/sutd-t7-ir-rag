# Mechanically coupled electrical filter.

## Abstract
A mechanically coupled electrical filter comprises two longitudinal mode vibrators 20a, 20b mechanically coupled together by a coupler 52. Each of the vibrators 20a, 20b is set up with a piezoelectric ceramic member 11a, 11b and constant modulus alloy members 21a, 21a , 21b, 21b mounted separately on its top and bottom surfaces. The two constant modulus alloy members 21a, 21a 21b, 21b on each ceramic member 11a, 11b have the same configuration, a frequency temperature characteristic opposite to that of the piezoelectric ceramic member 11a, 11b, and have their centres aligned with the centre of the piezoelectric ceramic member 11a 11b. Such configurations of the two longitud nal mode vibrators 20a, 20b suppress higher order harmonic and spurious vibrations and so filter out these components. In use an electrical signal is applied across the alloy members 21a, 21a of the input side vibrator 20a and results in its resonating at its fundamental frequency. This vibration is then mechanically coupled to the output side vibrator 20b with the result that it then resonates at substantially only its fundamental frequency. The mechanical vibration of the output side vibrator 20b generates an output electrical signal across its alloy members 21b, 21b which is substantially only at the fundamental frequency.
