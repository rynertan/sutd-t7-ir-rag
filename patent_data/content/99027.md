# Jig apparatus for use with industrial robots.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a jig apparatus for use with industrial robots, designed so that in processing work on a multikind and small and medium quantity production basis, when work to be automtically welded, soldered, painted or press worked is changed from one type to another, a jig table for clamping the work can be efficiently removably exchangeably mounted. To this end, the technical arrangement of the invention comprises a jig table for clamping work, and a slide disk adapted to be slid back and forth on guide rails laid on an installation stand placed on a whorkshop floor to carry in and out work with respect to a welding, soldering, press working or other industrial robot, wherein in order to removably assemble the jig table from above to the slide disk so that they can be integrally moved back and forth, a pawl disk fixed to the upper surface of the slide table and a second pawl disk fixed to the lower surface of the table in opposed relation to the first pawl disk are removably engaged with each other by means of turnable hook segments fitted on the outer peripheral surfaces of the two pawl disks, while a centering guide post fixedly erected on the center of the paw disk on the slide disk is removably fitted in the central opening in the pawl disk on the table through point contact between balls in a ball retainer fitted on the guide post and a centering guide bushing fitted in the central opening, the ball retainer being constantly subjected to an upward resilient force.
