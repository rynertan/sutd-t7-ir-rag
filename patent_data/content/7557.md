# Decontamination machine for decontaminating nuclear steam generator channel heads.

## Abstract
A decontamination machine comprises a first assembly including a vertical post 12 and a carriage track 13 with a movable carriage 14 thereon, the carriage track 13 being pivotally secured to the upper end portion of the post 12 so that the assembly can be collapsed to a size permitting entry into the channel head 1 through a manway 6 , with the assembly being sufficiently light in weight to permit its instal lation in the channel head 1 by no more than two individuals. The machine includes a horizontal support beam 20 and a curved track 23 which are separably secured to the vertical post 12 and to the outer end of the carriage track 13 so that a generally quadrantally shaped frame is provided. The car riage track 13 carries an adjustable decontamination blaster means 26 . Means are provided for moving the carriage along the carriage track 13 and for swinging the carriage track 13 both horizontally and vertically in the frame so that the decontamination means 26 has the capability of sweep ing past substantially all of the interiorly facing walls in the channel head 1 . Decontamination by remote operation becomes possible with this machine.
