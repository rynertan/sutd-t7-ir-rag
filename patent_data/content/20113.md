## Description
SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1 Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, more particularly to a metal insulator semiconductor hereinafter referred to as an MIS integrated circuit device, such as an MIS memory device used in an electronic computer. 2 Description of the Prior Art In recent years, a large scale integrated circuit, such as a random access memory device, has been manufactured by using MIS technology. This is because the MIS integrated circuit has a simple structure and can be manufactured by a simple manufacturing process, so that the MIS integrated circuit is quite suitable for large scale integration.However, since the area occupied by MIS Field Effect transistors and load elements of the MIS Field Effect transistors in MIS integrated circuit is relatively large, the chip size of the MIS integrated circuit increases greatly according to the increase of degree of integration, so that the probability of defects in the chip becomes large and, consequently, the production yield of the MIS integrated circuits becomes low. For example, a complementary MIS hereinafter referred to as a CMIS memory cell which is used in a conventional CMIS random access memory comprises, as illustrated in Fig. 1, two n channel type transistors Qnl and Qn2 which are driver transistors, two p channel type transistors Qpl and Qp2 which are load transistors of the driver transistors Qnl and Qn2 respectively, and two n channel type transistors Qn3 and Qn4 which are gate transistors. The gate electrodes of the gate transistors Qn3 and Qn4 are connected to a word line WL1 , and the source electrodes of the gate transistors Qn3 and Qn4 are connected to bit lines BL1 and BL1 , respectively.InFig. 1, for example, the logic 11111 state of the memory cell corresponds to the state wherein the potentials at P1 and P2 are low and high, respectively, i.e., the MIS transistors Qnl and Qp2 are conductive and the MIS transistors Qpl and Qn2 are non conductive. Similarly, the logic 0 IIstate of the memory cell of Fig. 1 corresponds to the state wherein the potentials at P1 and P2 are high and low, respectively, i.e., the MIS transistors Qpl and Qn2 are conductive and the MIS transistors Qnl and Qp2 are non conductive. The access operation of this memory cell is well known, and the explanation thereof is omitted herein. Since the memory cell of Fig. 1 uses six MIS transistors, including both n channel MIS transistors and p channel MIS transistors, the cell size thereof is relatively large. Therefore, it is difficult to make a large capacity memory device by using the memory cells of Fig. 1. Fig. 2 illus t ra tes an n channel type MIS memory cell which is used in a conventional MIS random access memory The structure 6f the memory cell of Fig. 2 is the same as that of the memory cell of Fig. 1, except that the load transistors Qpl and Qp2 of Fig. 1 are replaced by high resistance load elements R1 and R2 , which are made of polycrystalline silicon. Each of the high resistance load elements R1 and R2 can be formed in a smaller area on the MIS integrated circuit than that of the transistor Qpl or Qp2 of the memory cell of Fig. 1. However, the area occupied by the high resistance element is not sufficiently small for making the chip size so small that a high productivity of the MIS memory device is attained.Moreover, the high resistance element must be formed through a different manufacturing process from the process of making other polycrystalline silicon conductive layers, so that the manufacturing process of the MIS memory device becomes complicated. In order to reduce the area occupied by each of the load elements of the MIS transistors of an MIS integrated circuit, an MIS integrated circuit is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 53 39087 in which the load element of the MIS transistor consists of a substrate of the MIS integrated circuit and a barrier formed between a drain region of the MIS transistor and the substrate.However, this prior art MIS integrated circuit has a complicated structure and, therefore, the manufacturing process thereof is not simple. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is the principal object of the present invention to reduce the area occupied by the load element of the MIS transistor in the MIS integrated circuit, such as an MIS memory device, so that the degree of integration of theMIS integrated circuit can be increased. It is another object of the present invention to provide an MIS integrated circuit having high density integration which can be manufactured through a very simple manufacturing process. According to the present invention, there is provided an MIS integrated circuit device compirising one or more driver transistors and one or more load elements each of which is connected to one of the driver transistors respectively, characterized in that each of the driver transistors is composed of an MIS transistor formed on a semiconductor substrate portion, and each of the load elements is composed of a reverse biased pn junction which is formed on the semiconductor substrate portion. The present invention will be more clearly understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings.

Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view illustrating an MIS memory cell, as an embodiment of the present invention. Figs. 4, 5 and 6 are partial cross sectional views illustrating a manufacturing process of the MIS memory cell of Fig. 3. Fig. 7 is a cross sectional view illustrating an MIS transistor and a load thereof, as another embodiment of the present invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Fig. 3 illustrates a structure of an MIS memory cell according to the present invention. The memory cell ofFig. 3 is formed by using CMIS technology, although the memory cell of Fig. 3 contains only one type of an MIS transistor, for example n type MIS transistors Qnl and Qn2. Therefore, it is possible to use the memory cell of Fig. 3 in a CMIS memory device in which peripheral circuits, such as address buffers, are constructed by CMIS circuits. InFig. 3, on the surface of a p type well 2 which is formed on an n type silicon semiconductor substrate 1, two n channel type driver transistors Onl and n2 are formed. The transistors Qnl and Qn2 respectively comprise n type source regions 31 and 32, n type drain regions 41 and 42, thin insulator layers 71 and 72 made of silicon dioxide SiO2 , and gate electrodes 51 and 52 which are formed on the insulator layers 71 and 72 respectively. On the n type silicon semiconductor substrate 1, p type load regions 61 and 62 are formed. The n type silicon semiconductor substrate 1 is made of silicon having resistivity of 1 through 10 Slum. Impurity concentration of each of the n type load regions 61 and 62 is about 1020 cm3, Resistivity of n type silicon semiconductor substrate 1 can be about 50 Q cm in order to attain appropriate withstand voltage between the n type silicon semiconductor substrate 1 and the p type well 2. The The n type source regions 31 and 32 are both connected to the ground, the n type drain region 41 is connected to the gate electrode 52 and to the p type load region 62, and the n type drain region 42 is connected to the gate electrode 51 and to the p type load region 61. These connections are performed through conductive layers made, for example, of aluminum. In Fig. 3, the conductive layers are illustrated diagrammatically by connection lines, and detailed illustrations thereof are omitted. The gate transistors Qn3 and Qn4 are also formed on the p type well 2 in a similar manner to the driver tran sistors Qnl and Qn2 t and are connected to the driver n2 transistors Qnl and Qn2. In Fig. 3, illustrations of the gate transistors Qn3 and Qn4 are omitted. 3 In the above mentioned embodiment, the p type load regions 61 and 62 form, with n type silicon semiconductor substrate 1, incomplete pn junctions whose leak current, i.e., backward current, is relatively large. The n type silicon semicondcutor substrate 1 is connected to the positive voltage source Vcc Therefore, these pn junctions serve as load resistors of the driver transistors Qnl and 0n2 Consequently, an equivalent circuit of the structure of Fig. 3 is equal to the circuit of Fig. 2, except that the n type gate transistors Qn3 and Qn4 ofFig. 2 are not included.In the structure of Fig. 3, the backward resistors of the pn junctions formed by the p type load region 61 and the n type substrate 1 and by the p type load region 62 and the n type substrate 1 correspond to the resistors R1 and R2 of Fig. 2, respectively. It is quite easy to make the incomplete, i.e., leaky, pn junctions by the p type load regions 61, 62 and the n type substrate 1. For example, it is done by implanting impurity ions to the p type load regions 61, 62 and then annealing the chip. In order to make the pn junction whose leak current is about several nanoamperes, which is necessary for the operation of the memory cell, annealing temperature and time are controlled to be the appropriate values. It will be understood that, in the above mentioned embodiment of Fig. 3, the areas occupied by the p type load regions 61 and 62 are much smaller than the areas required for forming the p channel type MIS load transistorsQpl and Qp2 of the memory cell illustrated in Fig. 1, and the manufacturing process of the above mentioned pn junctions is much simpler than that of the p channel type MIS load transistors Qpl and Qp2. When compared with the memory cell of Fig. 2, which has the polycrystalline silicon high resistance load elements, the area occupied by the memory cell of Fig. 3 is smaller than that of the memory cell ofFig. 2, and the manufacturing process of the memory cell of Fig. 3 is simpler than that of the memory cell of Fig.2. This is because, in the memory cell of Fig. 2, the polycrystalline silicon load resistors R1 and R2 must be connected to the voltage source Vcc through conductive layers formed on the substrate, while, in the memory cell of Fig. 3, the aforementioned pn junctions are formed by the p type load regions 61, 62 and the n type silicon substrate 1, which is connected to the voltage sourceVcc t so that it is not necessary to form conductive layers connecting between the pn junctions and the voltage source Vcc. With reference to Figs. 4 through 6, the manufacturing process of the CMIS memory device which uses the MIS memroy cell of Fig. 3, according to the present invention, will now be explained. In the following explanation, the process of forming the leaky pn junction will be mainly explained. 1 As illustrated in Fig. 4, one of the n channel type MIS transistors Qn of the memory cell of Fig. 3, a p type load region JB constituting the pn junction with the n type silicon semiconductor substrate 11, and a p channel type MIS transistor Qp of another circuit, such as address buffer circuit, are formed on the substrate 11, by using the well known CMIS technology. In Fig. 4, the n channel type transistor Qn is formed on the p type well 12 which is formed on the n type substrate 11. The reference numeral 13 shows a first insulating layer made of PSG Phospho silicate Glass having apertures used for contacting electrodes, which apertures are formed by using the well known photolithography technology.The surface of the first insulating layer 13 is then smoothed, as illustrated in Fig. 4, by heat treatment. 2 A photoresist film 14 is formed on the surface of the device illustrated in Fig. 4, and a window is formed on the load region JQ by using photolithography technology, as illustrated in Fig. 5. 3 Impurity ions, for example Boron ions B , are implanted in the load region JQ by means of the well known ion implantation method. In this case, the dose of theBoron ion is selected to be, for example, in 0.5 x 1015 15 2 through 1 x 1015 cm , and the acceleration energy of the Boron ion is selected to be, for example, 100 KeV . 4 The implanted impurity ions are activated by means of heat treatment on the condition, for example, that the heating temperature is 500 OC and the heating time is 30 minutes. 5 After removing the photoresist film 14, conductive layers 151 and 152 of, for example, aluminum are formed by means of the well known sputtering or evaporation process. InIn Fig. 6, the conductive layer 151 connects then type drain region of the transistor Qn to the p type load region which forms the leaky pn junction with the n type silicon substrate 11. Lastly, the second insulating layer of PSG 16, which is also a protecting and passivating layer, is formed by means of CVD Chemical Vapor Deposition , and the memory chip is completed. As has been mentioned above, the CMIS device may be constructed on the n type substrate. However, it should be noted that the CMIS device can also be constructed on a p type substrate. In this case, p channel type MIS transistors are formed on the surface of n type well formed on the p type substrate, n channel type MIS transistors are formed on the surface of the p type substrate, and n type load regions are formed on the p type substrate. In the above mentioned embodiment, the CMIS memory device has been explained. However, it is also possible to adapt the present invention to the single channel typeMIS device, such as an n channel type MIS integrated circuit device. For example, as illustrated in Fig. 7, a p type load region 23 is formed on n type well 22 which is formed on p type silicon substrate 21. The p type load region 23 is connected to the gate electrode 24 of an n type MIS transistor Qn formed on the substrate 21 through conductive layer, which is illustrated diagrammatically by a connection line 25, made of aluminum. The positive voltage Vcc is supplied to the p type silicon substrate 21. The pn junction composed by the p type substrate 21 and the n type well 22 is forward biased and the pn junction composed by the p type load region 23 and n type well 22 is reverse biased. The pn junction composed by the p type load region 23 and n type well 22 is made incomplete, i.e., leaky, and is used as the load element of the n typeMIS transistor Qr.
