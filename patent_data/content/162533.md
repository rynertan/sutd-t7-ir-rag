# The detection of human cytomegalovirus specific IgM.

## Abstract
Monoclonal antibodies reactive to immediate early and or early HCMV. The detection of antigens especially HCMV antigens by concentrating them on a support and reacting them with monoclonal antibody. The support may be a ni trocellulose membrane immunodot . Alternatively the sup port may be a bead carrying a different monoclonal antibody, the two antibodies reacting with different epitopic sites on the antigenic protein. The use of HCMV monoclonal antibody in distinguishing between HCMV specific IgM and IgG.
