# CORROSION RESISTANT AUTODEPOSITION COMPOSITION

## Abstract
Compositions comprising from 0.1 to 15 weight per cent of an inhibitor comprising lead chromate or a copre cipitate of lead chromate wherein lead chromate com prises at least 50 weight percent of the coprecipitate allow the use of significantly reduced concentrations of hexa valent chromium rinse in autodeposition coating applica tions while affording good corrosion protection to the coated metal substrate.
