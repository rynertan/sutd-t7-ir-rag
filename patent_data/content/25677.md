## Description
WHEELS This invention relates to a manually adjustable wheel for a high horse power vehicle such as an agricultural tractor. It is known to provide agricultural tractors with manually adjustable wheels whereby the track, i.e the spacing between the driven wheels of the tractor, may be adjusted to suit its use in differing agricultural situations where for example differing widths of rows of crops have to be traversed by the tractor. Such known manually adjustable wheels usually comprise a rim detachably secured to a disc which is itself detachably secured in conventional manner to a hub at the end of a drive shaft. The means for detachably securing the rim to the disc usually comprises a plurality of lugs spaced apart circumferentially around the radially inner surface of the rim. The disc usually comprises a generally circular steel element having a scalloped periphery, the apices of the scallops providing circumferentially spaced apart portions of the disc adjacent the rim which are bolted to the lugs. It is an object of the invention to provide a manually adjustable wheel wherein the amount of material used in the disc is optimised having regard to the required strength of the wheel. According to the invention we provide a manually adjustable wheel for a vehicle, e.g. a tractor, comprising a rim to receive a tyre a plurality of fixing lugs spaced apart around the radially inner periphery of therm a disc arranged for connection to a hub of the vehicle and bolt means detachably securing the disc to the lugs the disc and the lugs being arranged so that the disc may be selectively secured to the lugs in either of two positions characterised in that the disc has substantially the shape of a square with the corners cut off so that the disc has an irregular octagonal shape having four longer sides and four shorter sides arranged alternately around the periphery of the octagon and in that the bolt means are located along the shorter sides of the disc only. The bolt means may comprise two bolts passing through the disc at each of the shorter sides thereof. The lugs may be of generally top hat section and arranged either with their channels extending parallel to the rotary axis of the wheel or at right angles to such rotary axis. Alternatively, each lug may be of Z shaped configuration when viewed radially of the rim so that the outer limbs of each Z are mutually displaced in a direction parallel to the rotary axis of the wheel, each limb having two bolt holes therein. The bolts and bolt holes may have mutually engaging formations to prevent rotation of the bolts in the holes. The features of the invention will become apparent from the following description given herein solely by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein FIGURES 1 and 2 are axial views of manually adjustable wheels constructed in accordance with the prior art FIGURE 3 is an axial view of a manually adjustable wheel constructed in accordance with one embodiment of the invention FIGURE 4 is a cross sectional view on the line 4 4 of Figure 3 FIGURE 5 is a cross sectional view on the line 5 5 of Figure 4 FIGURE 6 is an axial view of a manually adjustable wheel constructed in accordance with a second embodiment of the invention FIGURE 7 is a cross sectional view on the line 7 7 of Figure 6 FIGURE 8 is an axial view of a manually adjustable wheel constructed in accordance with a third embodiment of the invention and FIGURE 9 is a cross sectional view on the line 9 9 of Figure 8. Figures 1 and 2 of the drawings show manually adjustable tractor wheels as constructed by prior art methods. Thus, referring to Figure 1, it will be seen that the wheel rim 10 is provided on its radially inner surface with a set of eight equi distantly spaced apart lugs 12 welded to the rim. The disc 14, which is detachably secured to the rim lugs 12 by means of bolts 16, is of generally circular configuration but has a scalloped periphery with the apices of the scallops providing portions adjacent the rim which are boltable to the lugs. Figure 2 of the drawings shows a similar construction of wheel wherein six circumferentially spaced lugs 112 are provided on the rim 110 to which six corresponding portions of a generally circular disc 114 are boltable. In each case the variation in track is obtained by 1 varying the surface of the disc which is in contact with the hub and 2 varying the ends of the lugs against which the disc abuts. In each of the constructions shown in Figures 1 and 2 the construction of the disc 14 is extremely wasteful of metal since it is generally circular and is usually produced as a steel stamping out of a square or rectangular blank. A manually adjustable wheel in accordance with a first embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Figures 3 to 5 and, referring to Figure 3 it will be seen that the disc 20 in this construction is of substantially square configuration, the corner portions 22 of which are locally configured to an arcuate edge complementary to the radially inner surface of the rim 24. The shape of the disc is that of an irregular octagon having four long sides 20a and four short sides constituted by the corner portions 22, the long.and short sides occurring alternately around the periphery of the disc. Production of such a square disc from a square or rectangular blank is evidently not very wasteful of material and indeed the total amount of material present in the disc can be reduced in comparison with that used in the discs of the prior art. To secure the rim 24 to the disc 20 four equi distantly circumferentially spaced lugs 26 are welded to the radially inner surface of the rim 24. As will be seen in Figures 4 and 5 each lug 26 is of generally Z shaped configuration when viewed radially of the wheel and is produced from an arcuate sheet metal blank subsequently bent to the Z shape with end flanges 28 for stiffening the lug. The outer limbs of the Z of the lug thus provides two axially displaced mounting brackets 30 32 for the disc, and the radially outer edge of each of these brackets is welded to the rim as clearly shown at 34 in Figure 5. Although welds 34 are shown on both sides of each bracket 30 and 32 it may be convenient only to provide the welds 34 at the left hand side of the bracket as shown in Figure 5. Each of the two mounting brackets 30 32 of each lug is provided with two rectangular apertures 35 whereby bolts 36 having squares under their heads may be utilised for securing the rim 24 to the disc 20. The brackets 30 of all the lugs 26 are axially aligned i.e. lie in a single plane perpendicular to the rotary axis of the wheel and the brackets 32 of all the lugs 26 are also axially aligned in a plane displaced from the plane of the brackets 30. The circumferential distance between the lugs, and the size and shape of the sides 20a and corner portions 22 of the disc, are chosen so that, when it is required to de mount the rim from the disc, the bolts 36 may be withdrawn and the rim rotated and withdrawn axially of the disc. Sufficient elearance will be provided between the disc edge at the portions 22 and the rim to ensure that the disc edge does not to foul the welds 34. The bolt apertures 35 are positioned as close to the rim as possible to avoid.imparting excessive bending to the lugs when the disc is bolted thereto. As shown in Figures 3 and 4 of the drawings a set of eight fixing holes 38 is provided adjacent the centre of the disc 20 whereby the wheel may be secured to the hub of a drive shaft in conventional manner. Additional holes 40 spaced radially outwardly of the disc from the hub fixing holes 38 are provided for the attachment of weights as is known in agricultural applications. As shown in Figures 4 and 5 the disc 20 comprises a central planar section 42 which is securable to the hub with a transition portion 44 adjacent the fixing holes 38 for the purposes of stiffening the disc. A conic section 46 of the disc extends from this transition portion 44 to a radially outer planar portion 48, which is securable to the rim lugs 26. The thickness of the metal in the disc 20 is uniform throughout. The variation in the track of a vehicle fitted with the wheels described may be effected as follows. Referring toFigures.4 and 5 it will be seen that the disc 20 is bolted to the brackets 30. The bolts 36 can be withdrawn and the rim turned to clear the lugs from the corner portions 22 and then the corner portions 22 could be bolted to the brackets 32.Obviously the vehicle would have to be jacked up during this procedure. The disc is shown in Figure 4 diverging towards the right in that figure. The disc and the rim could be assembled with the disc diverging towards the left in that figure and engaged either with the brackets 30 or 32. It will thus be seen that there is a number of different configurations which will vary the track of the vehicle fitted with the wheels. Referring now to Figures 6 and 7, these show a second embodiment of the invention. There is a disc 50 secured to a rim 51. The disc has a central planar portion or nave 52 and a conical portion 53 leading to a portion 54 which is perpendicular to the rotary axis 55 of the wheel. The disc is made from a square blank and as shown in Figure 6 is generally octagonal in shape haying four longer sides 56 which alternate, around the periphery of the disc, with shorter sides 57. It will be noted that the longer sides 56 are slightly concave towards the centre of the disc while the shorter sides 57 are convex towards the centre of the disc. Secured to the radially inner periphery of the rim are eight lugs 58. These lugs are generally of top hat section and provide, referring to one of the lugs, a channel having sides 59, a base 60 and flanges 60a. The flanges 60a are welded to the rim and the channel in the lug extends generally parallel to the rotary axis of the wheel and receives a bolt 61 which passes through the lug and through an aperture 62 in the disc. Each bolt has a head 63 which is prevented from turning by a rib 64 under the head which fits in the channel of the lug as shown in Figure 7, and carries a nut and washer 65 and 66 respectively. It will be noted that the apertures 62 and the bolts 61 are located on the shorter sides only of the disc. Variation in track of a vehicle having wheels as shown in Figures 6 and 7 is obtained in the same way as described above either by reversing the disc 50 and or, by arranging the part 54 of the disc at. one side or the other of the lugs 58. Referring now to Figures 8 and 9, these show a third embodiment of the invention comprising a disc 70 and a rim 71. As shown in Figure 8, the disc has been made from a square blank and has four longer sides 72 and four shorter sides 73 so that it has the shape of an irregular octagon. It will be noted that the longer sides 72 are slightly concave towards the centre of the disc while the shorter sides 73 are slightly convex relative to the centre of the disc. The rim is secured to the disc by lugs and bolts as before. The lugs are indicated at 74 and as shown in Figure 9 are of top hat cross section having a base 75, side walls .76 and flanges 77. The flanges 77 are welded to the rim so that the channels in the top hat section extend perpendicular to the rotary axis of the wheel. Each lug is strengthened by a gusset plate 78. Still referring to Figure 8, the disc 70 has a central portion 79 adapted to be secured to the hub of a vehicle via apertures 90 and bolts or studs not shown , it then has a portion 80 which is perpendicular to the rotary axis of the wheel but displaced from the portion 79, outwardly of the.portion 80 is a conical portion 81 which then leads to a portion 82 perpendicular to the rotary axis of the wheel.The portions 82 provide the shorter sides 73. The disc is secured to the wheel by bolts 83 which have squared portions 84 on their shanks to engage in square section holes 85 in the walls 76 of a lug, each bolt having a threaded portion 86 to receive a nut 87 and washer 88. It will be noted that the bolts 83 pass through apertures 89 in the disc and that these apertures are located in the shorter sides 73. Variation in track of a vehicle having wheels as shown in Figures 8 and 9 is obtained as before either by reversing the position of the disc and or by changing the side wall of the lug against which the portions 82 of the disc abut. It will be seen that the invention provides a number of embodiment of wheels, specially for tractors, in which the discs can be made from square blanks with very little waste in material as compared with the considerable waste in material involved where the blanks are circular as shown inFigures 1 and 2 which relate to the prior art.
