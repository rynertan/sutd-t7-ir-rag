## Description
The invention relates to a television transmission system capable of transmitting a high resolution television signal. The document Electronics International Volume 57, No. 10, Hay 1984, pages 48, 50, New York High Definition TV scheme exploits inability of eye to detect all details of moving images discloses television transmitter techniques for transmitting a high resolution signal, said techniques comprising converting said high resolution television signal into a first and a second transmission signal in which said first transmission signal is compatible with a standard television receiver, and simultaneously transmitting said first and second transmission signals over two separate television channels. This document is silent about the implementation. The described techniques are only suitable to increase the horizontal resolution. One of the most disturbing characteristics of present day television is its inadequate vertical resolution which manifests on large displays by the viewer being able to discern the individual raster lines. Various systems have been proposed having an increased number of vertical scanning lines. However, these systems are not feasible as they require an excessive amount of bandwidth e.g. 30 MHz . Other systems have been proposed in which additional lines are transmitted over a separate channel or are generated in the television receiver by interpolation. e.g. S.M.P.T.E. Journal, vol. 93, no.8, Aug 1984, pp. 726 729, Scarsdale, New Jersey, US J.S. NADAN et al. Signal Processing for wide screen television The smart receiver All the above systems require an increase in cost allocated to both the broadcaster as well as the consumer. This brings into play the marketing of the new television system. It has been shown that increased resolution alone may not be sufficient to offset the increase in cost of a television receiver to the consumer. The object of the present invention is to provide a wide image high resolution television transmission system compatible with existing television receivers in which increases in both the perceived horizontal and vertical resolutions are balanced. According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a method of transmitting a high resolution televion signal forming picture frames having a width which is wider than that of a standard aspect ratio picture frame and having a bandwidth greater than that of a standard television signal, said high resolution television signal including a multiple of m scanning lines, where m is a standard number of scanning lines said method comprising converting said high resolution television signal into a first and a second transmission signal in which at least the first transmission signal is compatible with a standard television receiver said conversion comprising the steps of According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a television transmitter for transmitting a high resolution television signal forming picture frames having a width which is wider than that of a standard aspect ratio picture frame and having a bandwidth greater than that of a standard television signal, said high resolution television signal including a multiple of m scanning lines, where m is a standard number of scanning lines, said transmitter including According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided a television receiver for receiving a transmitted high resolution television signal forming picture frames having a width which is wider than that of a standard aspect ratio picture frame and having a bandwidth greater than that of a standard television signal, said high resolution television signal including a multiple of m scanning lines, where m is a standard number of scanning lines, said television receiver including The subject invention is inter alia based on the recognition that there is a practical limit above which the human vision system is unable to perceive small, rapidly moving objects in a picture. Hence it is possible to attain twice the perceived horizontal resolution in only two channels of bandwidth by refreshing high spatial frequency information at a rate less than the picture frame rate. In the view of the above, an embodiment of the television system of the subject invention is further characterized in that the high frequency band is divided, by frequency, into p sections, where p is an integer, the sections being multiplexed into the second transmission signal, whereby each one of the sections is included in a respective picture frame formed by the second transmission signal. In this embodiment the high frequency band in its entirety is included in p successive picture frames. The subject invention is further based on the recognition that the required bandwidth of a system increases in proportion with the square of the number of lines. For this reason, it is preferable to use the minimum number of lines in order to minimize the bandwidth required and or use the minimum number of standard broadcast channels. It has been found that the perceived vertical resolution of a television picture can be increased not only by increasing the actual number of lines, but by also retaining the standard signal format for transmission, i.e. two fields forming a picture frame in which the lines therein interlaced, and by forming, prior to display, intervening lines in each field by spatial and temporal interpolation. This effectively generates a sequential display in which each of the fields forms a complete picture frame. Based on the above, an embodiment of the television receiver of the subject invention is characterized in that said television receiver further comprises an interlace to sequential converter coupled to said adding means for generating intervening lines between the lines in each field of said reconstructed high resolution television signal thereby effectively generating a sequentially scanned picture frame having a frame rate which is twice that of said standard television signal. With the above and additional objects and advantages in mind as will hereinafter appear, the subject invention will be described by way of non limiting examples with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows a television transmission system incorporating the subject invention Figure 2 shows a respresentation of a display obtainable with the present invention Figures 3A 3C show graphically the conversion of a high resolution television signal, on a display, into two standard television signals, on display Figures 4A 4C show, graphically, the temporal multiplexing and the subsequent build up of the high resolution television signal Figure 5 shows, in block diagram form, an embodiment for converting the high resolution television signal into two transmission signals Figures 6A 6C show, in block diagram form, embodiments for a spatio temporal converter and Figure 7 shows, in block diagram form, an embodiment for reconstructing the high resolution television signal from the two transmission signals. A television transmission system in accordance with the present invention is shown in Figure 1. A television camera 1 is adapted to generate a high resolution television signal and contains circuitry for converting the signal into a first and a second transmission signal of which at least the first transmission signal conforms with, for example, the NTSC television standard. The first television signal is then applied to a first transmitter 3 with its associated transmission channel, shown here as antenna 4, while the second transmission signal is simultaneously applied to a second transmitter 5 with its transmission channel, shown as antenna 6. In the event a standard broadcast is contemplated, a switch 7 is inserted before the second transmitter 5 and interrupts any signals thereto. The first transmission signal is viewable on a standard television receiver 8 having a single tuner. However, with a high resolution television receiver 9, both transmission signals may be simultaneously received, respectively by the two tuners therein and thereupon reconverted into the high resolution television signal. As illustrated in Figure 2, the subject television transmission system generates a high resolution television signal for forming a picture on display having an aspect ratio of 16 9. This is in contrast with the standard displayed picture having an aspect ratio of 4 3 which is conveniently shown in the centre of the wider display picture. This 16 9 aspect ratio is selected to support the simultaneously viewing of two standard 4 3 aspect ratio signals, without overlap, on the same display. Each picture frame of the high resolution television signal is not only wider than the standard television picture frame, but also includes, in the present embodiment, 25 more scanning lines and has a significantly higher bandwidth. For the NTSC standard, this results in 657 scanning lines, each having a time duration of approximately 42 µs, and a bandwidth of 14.0 MHz as opposed to 4.2 MHz for the active video signal. As indicated in the non prepublished US patent No. 4.613.903, in order to transmit the signal over the standard television channels, it is necessary to convert the high resolution television signal into at least two transmission signals compatible with the relevant standard, which transmission signals are then simultaneously transmitted over separate standard television channels. Figures 3A, 3B and 3C show picture frames resulting from the display of the high resolution television signal and of the two transmission signals, respectively. In order to conform to standard television channel limitations, e.g. 525 lines frame each line having a duration of approximately 52.5 µs, and a bandwidth of 4.2 MHz, the central portion of A of the high resolution picture frame Figure 3A , corresponding to the aspect ratio of a standard television picture frame, is separated from the rest of the high resolution picture frame, bandwidth limited to 7.0 MHz, and the number of lines therein converted to that of the relevant standard e.g. 525 lines . The signal then forms a first of the two transmission signals Figure 3B and is viewable on a standard receiver, albeit with the standard width and resolution. The remaining portions of the high resolution television signal are combined and form a second of the two transmission signals which may also be viewable on a standard television receiver Figure 3C . In order to double the horizontal resolution, the bandwidth of the high resolution television signal of the present embodiment, having 657 scanning lines per picture frame and a 16 9 aspect ratio, would be 3 1 3 times that of an NTSC channel. This is not acceptable as it would then require four NTSC channels. It has been found that human vision requires a finite period of time to perceive changes in images. In general, the difficulty in perceiving an image increases as its subtended spatial angle decreases and or its rate of motion increases. The operational impact of this is that it is unnecessary to transmit the high spatial frequency information in pictures at the standard NTSC 30 frames per second rate. The required transmission bandwidth may be significantly reduced without affecting the perceived horizontal resolution by transmitting low spatial information below 7.0 MHz at the standard frame rate, and refreshing high spatial frequency information above 7.0 MHz below the standard frame rate. Figures 4A 4C each show graphically the bandwidth envelopes for ten consecutive television picture frames a j . Figure 4A represents an original high resolution television signal having a bandwidth of 14.0 MHz. In each of the ten picture frames, that portion above 7.0 MHz is divided into five frequency bands. Figure 4B represents the bandwidth envelope for that part of the second television tranmission signal used to transmit the high frequency information. The number within this frequency band, in each bandwidth envelope frame, relates to the actual frequency band in the original high resolution signal. In a high resolution television receiver, these frequency bands are stored, along with the rest of the signal and over the course of several television picture frames, then high spatial frequency information is built up and refreshed as shown in Figure 4C. Table 1 illustrates three methods with which the various frequency bands may be refreshed. In a method A, each of the frequency bands are refreshed at the rate of 6 Hz, i.e. once every five picture frames. The ensuing description of the preferred embodiment is based on this method for purposes of illustration only. Methods B and C show various other weighted rates of refresh. Method C is much closer to the optimum for human vision wherein the lower frequency bands of the high spatial frequency information are refreshed at a higher rate than the upper frequency bands thereof. Figure 5 shows, in block diagram form, an embodiment for converting a high resolution television signal into two transmission signals. The active video portion of the high resolution signal is applied to an analog to digital converter ADC 10. The digital output from ADC 10 is then applied to a lowpass filter 12 having a cut off frequency of 7.0 MHz, the output therefrom being applied to a line scan converter 14. Line scan converter 14 transforms the 657 lines per frame digitized and filtered high resolution television signal into 525 lines per frame, for example by converting every five lines a, b, c, d, e in the 657 line signal into four lines a, f, g, h, in accordance with the relationships a a, f 3b c 4, g c d w and h d 3e 4. Line scan converter 14 may be of any suitable type known in the art, for example, the interpolator disclosed in US Patent Re. 31.460, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The output from line scan converter 14 is applied to a demultiplexer 16 which is suitably clocked such that the portions of the converted signal constituting the areas A, B1 and B2 shown in Figure 3A appear, respectively, at the three outputs thereof. The output corresponding to the area A is then applied to a 5 3 time expander 18, which may be a buffer memory and which lengthens each of the lines in area A to the standard 52.5 µs and also reduces the bandwidth to the standard 4.2 MHz, and then is applied to a digital to analog converter DAC 20 for application to a first television transmitter not shown as the first transmission signal. The output from ADC is also applied to a high pass filter having a cut off frequency of 7.0 MHz, and then to a spatio temporal converter 24, which selects portions of the high spatial frequency information applied thereto for multiplexing into the second transmission signal. To this end, the output from spatio temporal converter 24 is applied to a multiplexer 26. Multiplexer 26 also receives every fifth line in the digitized high resolution television signal, identified as line b in the line scan converter 14. Each line b, which has a duration of approximately 42 µs, is then cut in half in formatter 28 and each half is subjected to a 5 3 time expansion in the time expander 30. In the time expander 18, the bandwidth of each half of line b is reduced to 4.2 MHz while the time duration is increased to approximately 35 µs. This signal is then applied to multiplexer 26. Multiplexer 26 may then be clocked at the standard line frequency f There are various ways in which the spatio temporal converter 25 may be arranged. In figure 6A, the signal from highpass filter 22 is divided into half line segments in formatter 40. These segments are the frequency converted in converter 42 to lie within the bandwidth 0 7.0 MHz. This down converted signal, comprising half line segments, is then subjected to a 5 3 time expansion in time expander 44, making each half line segment approximately 35 µs in duration with a bandwidth of 4.2 MHz. The output of time expander 44 is then applied to a five output demultiplexer 46 clocked at 2 1 2 times the standard line frequency f Figure 6B shows a second embodiment of the spatio temporal converter 24. The signal from highpass filter 22 is divided into half line segments in formatter 40. The output from formatter 40 is applied in parallel to bandpass filters 48 and 50 which have the passbands 7.0 10.5 MHz and 10.5 14.0 MHz, respectively. The outputs of these filters 48 and 50 are frequency converted to the frequency range 0 3.5 MHz in the frequency converters 52 and 54, respectively, and then subjected to a 5 3 time expansion in time expanders 56 and 58, respectively. The half line segments at the respective outputs of time expanders 56 and 58 are 35 µs in duration and occupy the frequency band 0 2.1 MHz. These half line segments are then applied to demultiplexers 60 and 62, respectively, which each have five outputs and are clocked at the rate 2 1 2 times f Figure 6C shows another embodiment of the spatio temporal converter 24. The signal from high pass filter 22 is applied to a programmable bandpass filter and frequency converter 70. The programmable filter converter 70 divides the signal applied thereto into selected frequency bands and then frequency converts these selected bands to a single frequency band. In this example, the high spatial information occupying the frequency band 7.0 14.0 MHz is divided into five selected frequency bands, for example, 7.0 8.4 MHz, 8.4 9.8 MHz, 9.8 11.2 MHz, 11.2 12.6 MHz and 12.6 14.0 MHz. Each of these frequency bands, when selected, is frequency converted to the frequency band 0 1.4 MHz. The programmable filter converter 70 cycles through the selected frequency bands at the standard picture frame rate 1 2 f The output from the programmable filter converter 70 is then subjected to a 3 1 time compression in time compressor 72 which reduces the duration of each line to 14 µs and increases the bandwidth to 4.2 MHz. A first formatter 74 is used to divide each of the compressed lines in half. A second formatter 76 then combines every five of the input half lines into a new line, which results in a signal having 262 lines frame, with a line duration of 35 µs and a bandwidth of 4.2 MHz. Figure 7 shows, in block diagram form, an embodiment for reconstructing the high resolution television signal from the two transmission signals. The active video portions of the first and the second transmission signals are applied to respective analog to digital converters ADC 80 and 82. The output of ADC 82 is then applied to a demultiplexer 84 which provides at two of its three outputs, signals representative of areas B1 and B2. These two signals, along with the output signal from ADC 80 representing area A, are applied to a multiplexer 86 for forming a low resolution television signal having 525 lines frame and an aspect ratio of 16 9. The third output of demultiplexer 84, containing the lines b and the multiplexed high frequency information, is applied to a demultiplexer 88 having two outputs. The output of demultiplexer 88 containing the lines b is applied to a 5 3 time compressor 90 and a formatter 92, which combines every two half line segments in the signal b into a single line. The output of multiplexer 86 is also applied to a 5 3 time compressor 94 and, along with the output of formatter 92, is applied to a line scan converter 96 which is the complement to line scan converter 14. This line scan converter 96 converts four input lines a, f, g, h from multiplexer 86 and line b from demultiplexer 88 into the original five lines a e in accordance with the relationships a a, b b, c 4f 3b, d 2g c, and e 4h d 3. The other output of demultiplexer 88 containing the multiplexed high frequency information is applied to a spatio temporal converter 98. Spatio temporal converter 98 is the complement to the spatio temporal converter 24 and converts the multiplexed high frequency information back into its original format for combination with the low frequency information. The output signal from the line scan converter 96 and the output signal from the spatio temporal converter 98 are applied to a frame store 100 which combines the two signals and provides a high resolution television signal at the output thereof. In order to double the perceived vertical resolution, this signal is then applied to an interlace to sequential scan converter 102 which generates additional lines between the lines of the signal applied thereto, thereby, in effect, converting the two field interlaced 657 line signal having a picture frame rate of 30 hertz, into sequentially scanned 60 hertz picture frames each having substantially 657 lines. Scan converter 102 may be of any suitable design, for example, that disclosed in US A 4.468.693 of Fujita et al, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Numerous alterations to the structure disclosed herein will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art. However, it is to be understood that the present disclosures relate to a preferred embodiment of the invention which is for purposes of illustration only not be construed as a limitation of the invention.
