## Description
FIGURE 1 is a schematic drawing of a prokaryotic plasmid with a viral mediator sequence and a promoter regulatory sequence inserted therein. Exogenous DNA has been expressed in higher eukaryotic cells by a variety of methods, principally as either a defective virus vector or by direct introduction of DNA containing a selectable marker. Defective virus vectors consist of exogenous DNA linked to a subset of viral genes, typically containing at least a viral origin of replication and a portion of the structural protein coding information of the virus. These vectors are introduced into eukaryotic cells and rescued with a helper virus. The resulting mixture of virus contains both defective viruses, linked to exogenous DNA, and helper virus. Defective SV 40 vectors are the best examples of current defective virus vectors. A variety of exogenous DNAs have been expressed in SV 40 derived vectors Goff, SP. and Berg, P.

Gene expression of exogenous DNA directly introduced into eukaryotic cells was initially achieved by transformation of thymidine kinase deficient TK cells to a TK phenotype by the herpes simplex virus HSV thymidine kinase gene, Bacchetti, S., and Graham, F.L.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76, 5714 5718 1979 Recently, a herpes virus derived defective virus vector has been described by Spaete, R.R. and Frenkel, N., Cell 30, 295 304 1982 . This vector, like the SV 40 derived vectors, is propagated as a defective virus in an HSV population. The cloning vector described in the present invention is a plasmid which is recognized in HSV infected eukaryotic cells as viral, allowing expression of exogenous DNA as though the sequences were HSV DNA. In addition, the vector is capable of directing expression in the absence of HSV infection. The general strategy for the construction of the eukaryotic expression vector is to insert a PvuII fragment containing the coding segments for the HSV tk gene into the pBR322 plasmid as a promoter regulatory sequence. The BamHI N fragment from the F strain of HSV is then inserted as a viral mediator sequence into the resulting plasmid at the unique BamHI site. The gene to be expressed is inserted into a restriction endonuclease site on the PvuII fragment and the resulting plasmid is in turn used to transform an eukaryotic cell. The gene is expressed with or without viral mediation. This invention encompasses an eukaryotic expression vector constructed from a prokaryotic plasmid by inserting a viral mediator sequence contained in the BamHI N fragment of HSV DNA and a promoter regulatory sequence with a restriction endonuclease site for inserting a gene to be expressed. The gene to be expressed is inserted in a restriction endonuclease site in the HSV promoter regulator sequence. Thus, the invention includes the eukaryotic expression vector, the eukaryotic expression vector with the gene inserted as well as the viral mediator DNA sequence which is contained in the BamHI N fragment of HSV DNA. In a preferred embodiment, the prokaryotic plasmid is pBR322 the HSV promoter regulatory sequence is a PvuII fragment of HSV DNA coding for the thymidine kinase gene and associated promoter regulatory sequence with a restriction endonuclease site between the promoter and the initiator codon the first adenine thymine guanine ATG sequence of the thymidine kinase gene, inserted in a PvuII site of the prokaryotic plasmid and the HSV mediator sequence is the BamHI N fragment of HSV DNA inserted into a BamHI site of the prokaryotic plasmid. Those skilled in the genetic engineering arts will recognize a wide variety of genes such as genes for hepatitis A, B, core and Non A Non B antigens which can be expressed by this expression vector. The BamHI N fragment of HSV allows the maintenance of DNA sequences, contained within the expression vector, in eukaryotic cells. Inclusion of the BamHI N fragment into an eukaryotic expression vector permits the vector to be maintained as an extrachromosomal element within eukaryotic cells. The extrachromosomal state can be maintained for at least thirty cell generations, at low copy number, and thus the BamHI N fragment must contain an origin of replication recognizable by eukaryotic DNA polymerases. Thus the function of the BamHI N fragment is entirely independent of any function these sequences serve in HSV replication or gene expression. A BamHI N fragment of HSV DNA is inserted in the BamHI site of the pBR322 plasmid as the HSV mediator sequence and a PvuII fragment of HSV DNA coding for the thymidine kinase gene is inserted into the PvuII site of the pBR322 plasmid as the promotor regulatory sequence. A gene to be expressed, such as the gene for the hepatitis B virus surface antigen, is conveniently inserted into the BglII site in the PvuII insert. When baby hamster kidney cells are transformed with this later vector and infected with herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B surface HBsAg antigen is produced at a rate of 10⁴ 10⁵ molecules per cell. When this expression vector and a selectable gene such as HSV thimidine kinase tk gene are introduced into mouse cells which are thymidine kinase negative Ltk cells , a cell line is established which is capable of gene expression HBsAg without virus. The invention is illustrated by the hereinafter set out examples and the examples are not intended to limit the invention. Those skilled in the genetic engineering arts will recognize that DNA segments obtained from a viral source and used for the mediator sequence and the promoter sequence can be synthesized. Restriction endonucleases were obtained from Bethesda Research Laboratories and New England Bio Labs and digestions carried out by methods recommended by the manufacturer. T4 DNA ligase made from T4 infected The pBR322 plasmid is propagatged in A commercially available Bethesda Research Laboratories BamHI Q fragment of HSV hereinafter referred to as pHVS 106 is purified as described above and digested with PvuII . The digested plasmid DNA is extracted with phenol chloroform, ethanol precipitated, and resuspended in ligation buffer 50 mM Tris pH 7.8, 10 mM MgCl₂, 20 mM dithiothreitol DTT , 1 mM adenosine triphosphate ATP , 50 microgram ml bovine serum albumin . The pBR322 plasmid is similarly digested with PvuII , phenol chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated and resuspended in TE. The PvuII digested pBR322 DNA is incubated with calf alkaline phosphatase CAP at a concentration of 0.5 units CAP microgram DNA for 30 minutes at 37 C. The phosphatased DNA is phenol chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated and resuspended in ligation buffer. This DNA is ligated with the PvuII digested HSV tk plasmid at a ratio of 1 1 with 10 units T4 DNA ligase ul reaction mixture, for 16 hours at 16 C. The ligated DNA is diluted 1 1 with TCM 10 mM Tris pH 7.0, 10 mM CaCl₂ 10 mM MgSO₄ and used to transform calcium treated HSV DNA is prepared from infected Hep 2 cells a continuous human cell line established from epidermoid carcinoma tissue from the larynx by sodium iodide density gradient centrifugation of Hep 2 cell lysates in the presence of ethidium bromide Walboomers, J.M.M. and Ter Schegget, J., Virology 74, 256 258 1976 . The viral DNA 1.0 ug is digested with BamHI and ligated to BamHI digested pBR322 0.1 ug at a concentration of 100 ug ml with 1 unit ligase ul reaction at 16 C for 3 hours, diluted 1 5 with ligation buffer and the ligation continued for an additional 15 hours. The ligated DNA is diluted 1 1 with TCM and used to transform calcium treated The pBHVtk2 plasmid with the promoter regulatory sequence is then propagated in The eukaryotic expression vector is diagramatically represented in FIGURE 1. FIGURE 1 represents a pBR322 plasmid with PstI, EcoRI, PvuII and BamHI N restriction endonuclease sites with HSV tk gene promoter regulatory sequence inserted at the PvuII site and the HSV BamHI N fragment inserted at the BamHI site. PvuII, BamHI , EcoRI, PstI, BglII , HincII and KpnI represent sites on the plasmid cleaved by the restriction endonuclease enzyme abbreviated by the respective symbol IRL Press Limited, Falconberg Court, London W1V 5FG, V.K. pp 117 . The utility of the eukaryotic expression vector is demonstated by the ability to direct synthesis of HBsAg in baby hamster kidney cells BHK after insertion of HBsAg coding sequence into the expression vector and transformation of BHK cells, followed by infection of the BHK cells with HSV. The HBsAg coding sequences are isolated by BamHI digestion of a recombinant plasmid containing the hepatitis B virus genome. The digested plasmid is electrophoresed on 5 polyacrylamide gels and the DNA visualized by ethidium bromide staining and UV illumination. The portion of the gels containing the 1.3 kilobase pair kbp fragment is sliced out, placed in a small dialysis bag with 0.1X TBE 50mMTris borate pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA and electrophoresed in TBE until the ethidium bromide stained DNA has migrated out of the gel slice and onto the dialyse bag. Electrophoretic polarity is reversed for 30 seconds, the DNA removed, concentrated by ethanol precipitation, and resuspended in ligation buffer. The eukaryotic expression vector is digested with BglII , phenol extracted, ethanol precipitated and resuspended in TE. The digested DNA is incubated with CAP 0.5 units ug DNA at 37 C for 30 minutes, phenol extracted and ethanol precipitated. The phosphatased eukaryotic expression vector is resuspended in ligation buffer and ligated to the 1.3 kbp HBsAg fragment at a ratio of 1 1 with T4 DNA ligase 1 unit ul reaction mix at a concentration of 100 ug DNA ml for 16 hours at 16 C. The ligated DNA is diluted 1 1 with TCM and used to transform calcium treated The restriction plasmid is identified by the presence of a unique XbaI restriction endonuclease site within a 3.3 kbp kilobase pairs PvuII fragment. This construction results in two types of inserts, one with the 5 end of the HBsAg coding sequences immediately adjacent to the tk promoter, and one in the opposite orientation. These plasmids were propagated in Ten micrograms of the plasmid with the HBsAg coding sequence adjacent the tk promoter are added to 1.0 ml HeBS 8 g l NaCl, 0.37 g l KCl, 0.25 g l Na₂ HPO₄.12H₂O, 1.0 g l Dextrose, 5.0 g l Hepes, pH 7.1 , mixed well and 2.5 M CaCl₂ added to a final concentration of 0.125 M while a gentle stream of air is bubbled through the mixture during addition of CaCl₂ and for an additional 30 seconds. The DNA is allowed to precipitate for 30 minutes at room temperature and 0.5 ml is added to 25cm² dishes of baby hamster kidney cells BHK . The cells are incubated with the DNA precipitate with gentle rocking at 37 C for 30 minutes and at 37 C without rocking for 30 minutes, 5 ml of EC 5 Eagles minimal media with 5 calf serum are added to each plate, and incubation continued for 3 hours at 37 C. Four hours after addition of the DNA, the culture medium is removed, cells are washed 1x with EC 5, and 1.0 ml of 25 dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO in Heps is added to each plate for 4 minutes at room temperature. The 25 DMSO is removed, dishes washed 2x with EC 5 and the cells incubated in EC 5 medium. The cells are infected with HSV 0.1PFU ml 24 hours after addition of DNA and the infection allowed to proceed for 48 hours. HBsAg is isolated from the culture fluids by high speed centrifugation 3 hours at 100,000 x g , resuspended as a 10x concentrate of the original volume and assayed with the Ausria II 125 HBsAg detection kit Abbott Laboratories as recommended by the manufacturer. HBsAg is routinely detected at levels ranging from 10⁴ 10⁵ molecules cell. The utility of the eukaryotic expression vector as a virus independent expression vector is demonstrated by the ability to direct synthesis of HBsAg in mouse L thymidine kinase negative Ltk cells after co insertion into the cells of both the eukaryotic expression vector and the eukaryotic expression vector with the coding sequence for HBsAg inserted and subsequent selection of cells containing the thymide kinase positive tk phenotype. In this instance the coding sequences of the expression vector serve as a selectable gene for isolation of those cells containing the tk phenotype. Note that in this instance, any selection gene could be used in place of pBHVntk2, e.g., oncogenes, neomycin kanamycin resitance. These cells express surface antigen in the absence of virus. The level of surface antigen synthesis can be amplified by infection with HSV. Mouse Ltk cells were propagated in Dulbecco s minimal medium supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum DMEM 10 and containing 25 ug ml bromodeoxyuridine BUdR . Cells used for transformation were passaged once in DMEM without BUdR prior to insertion of DNA. Five micrograms of the eukaryotic expression vector and 5 ug of that vector with the HBsAg coding sequence inserted are added to 1.0 ml HeBS, mixed well, and CaCl₂ is added to a final concentration of 0.125 M while a gentle stream of air is bubbled through the mixture during addition of CaCl₂ and for an additional 30 seconds. The DNA is allowed to precipitate for 30 minutes at room temperature and 0.5 ml added to 25cm² dishes of Ltk cells. The cells are incubated with the DNA precipitate for 1 hour at 37 C , and 5 ml of DMEM containing 5 fetal calf serum DMEM 5 are added and incubation is continued for 3 hours at 37 C. Four hours after addition of the DNA, the culture medium is removed and the cells are washed 2x with DMEM 5. The transformed cells are incubated for an additional 24 hours in DMEM 5 at which time the growth medium is changed to selective HAT medium DMEM 10 containing 15.0 ug ml hypoxanthine, 0.2 ug ml methotrexate, 5.0 ug ml thymidine . Cells are maintained in HAT medium for 2 3 weeks until tk clones are apparent. At this point a continuous cell line is established by trypinization of the clones and propagation in HAT medium, or single cell cloned lines obtained by limiting dilution of trypsinized cells in 96 well microtiter tissue culture trays. The cell lines are assayed for HBsAg as described in Example 1. HBsAg in synthesized in continuous cell lines at approximately 10³ 10⁴ molecules cell 48 hours and can be amplified to approximately 10⁴ 10⁵ molecule cell by infection with HSV. Levels of HbsAg from single cell cloned lines, expressing HBsAg, are approximately ten fold higher than the parent continuous cell line.
