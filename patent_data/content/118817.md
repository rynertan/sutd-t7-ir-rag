# Process for the preparation of an isomeric composition of 1 2,6,6 trimethylcyclohexyl hexan 3 ol, use of the obtained composition and intermediate carbinols.

## Abstract
Process for the preparation of ansomeric composition of cis and trans 1 2,6,6 trimethylcyclohexyl hexan 3 ol con sisting of a predominant amount, but not less than about 60 by weight of the trans isomer and a definite amount, but not more than 40 by weight of the cis isomer. The process uses hex 1 yn 3 ol and 2,6,6 trimethylcyclohexanone as starting materials. Utilization of the obtained composition as perfume ingre dients.
