# Method of producing a composite material composed of a matrix and an amorphous material.

## Abstract
A composite material composed of a matrix and an amorphous material of a desired disposition state is pro duced by positioning a given shape of crystals, of a type easily transformable to the amorphous state by irradiation with a particle ray, on the surface and or the interior of the matrix, at a predetermined position, and irradiating the crystals by the particle ray under an irradiation condition for transforming the crystals preferentially to the amorphous state.
