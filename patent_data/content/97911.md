# Projectile Fuze.

## Abstract
A fuze for firing the explosive charge of a projectile is disclosed which comprises in combination a firing mechan ism 12 , including a firing pin 13 , mounted resiliently in said projectile for rearward axial movement of the pin to fire the charge, a probe 20 , including forward and rearward ends and an integral shear washer 23 between the ends, mounted in the projectile with the forward end positioned to receive impact from media traversed by the projectile, with the rearward end slightly spaced forward of the firing mechanism, the washer normally preventing movement of the probe toward the mechanism, so that impact of the fuze with a rigid target shears the washer and enables the probe to engage the mechanism and thereby cause firing of the projectile.
