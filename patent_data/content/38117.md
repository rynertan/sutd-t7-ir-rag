## Description
METHODS FOR PREPARING ANTI HYPERTENSIVE AGENTS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Angiotensin converting enzyme peptidyldipeptide hydrolase, hereinafter referred to as ACE occupies a central role in the physiology of hypertension. The enzyme is capable of converting the decapeptide angiotensin I, having the sequence AspArgValTyrIleHisProPheHisLeu to an octapeptide, angiotensin II, by catalyzing the hydrolysis of angiotensin I s penultimate peptide bond, and thereby effecting the removal of the carboxyl terminal HisLeu. The symbols for various chemical entities are explained in the following table ACE Angiotensin converting enzyme Ala L alanine Arg L arginine Asp L aspartic acid Boc t butyloxycarbonyl. Bpoc 2 4 biphenyl 2 propyloxycarbonyl Bz benzoyl Cbo benzyloxycarbonyl DdZ N alpha , alpha dimethyl 3,5 dimethyloxycarbonyl Gly glycine His L histidine Ile L isoleucine Leu L leucine Phe L phenylalanine Ppoc 2 phenylisopropyloxycarbonyl Pro L proline Pro L 3,4 dehydroproline Ser L s erine Trp L tryptophan Tyr L tyrosine Val L valine Angiotensin II is a powerful pressor blood pressure elevating agent. In addition to its direct pressor effect, angiotensin II stimulates release of aldosterone which tends to elevate blood pressure by causing retention of extracellular salt and fluids. Angiotensin TI is found in measurable amount in the blood of normal humans.Howev er, it is found at elevated concentrations in the blood of patients with renal hypertension. The level of ACE activity is ordinarily in excess, in both normal and hypertensive humans, of the amount needed to maintain observed levels of angiotensin II. However, it has been found that significant blood pre ssure lowering is achieved in hypertensive patients by treatment with ACE inhibitors. LGavras, I., et al., New Engl. T. Med. 291, 817 1974 . The role of ACE in the pathogenesis of hypertension has prompted a search for inhibitors of the enzyme that could act as antihypertensive drugs. See for example U.S. Patents 3,891,616, 3,947,575, 4,052,511 and 4,053,651. The reactivity of ACE varies markedly depending on the substrate.Many peptides which are called inhibitors of the enzymatic conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II are in fact substrates having a lower Michaelis constant Km than angiotensinI. Such peptides are more properly termed competitive substrates. Numerous synthetic peptide derivatives have been shown to be ACE inhibitors by Ondetti, et al. in U.S. Patent 3,832,337 issued August 27, 1974. A highly effective inhibitor, with high biological activity when orally administered, is D 3 mercapto 2 methylpropanoyl L proline, designated 5Q14225, disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,046,889 toOndetti et al., issued September 6, 1977, and in scientific articles by Cushman, D.W. et al., Biochemistry 16, 5484 1977 , and by Ondetti, M. et al., Scienc 196, 441 1977 .The inhibitor SQ14225 reportedly has an I50 value of 2.3 x 10 8M. The 150 value reported by Cushman, et al., suprs is the concentration of inhibitor re qui red to produce 50 inhibition of the enzyme under a standard assay system containing substrate at a lev el substantially above Km It will be understood that 150 values are directly comparable when all potential factors affecting the reaction are kept constant.These factors include the source of enzyme, its purity, the substrate used and its con ce ntra tio n, and the composition of the assay buffer. All 150 data reported herein have been performed with the same assay system and same enzyme human urinary ACE and with an approxirnately 1 2 K level of sub m strate and are therefore internally consistent. The mode of action of So14225 has been based upon a model of the active site of ACE developed by analogy with the better known related enzyme, carboxypeptidase A. The active site was postulated to have a cationic site for binding the carboxyl end group of the substrate and a pocket or cleft capable of binding the side chain of the C terminal amino acid and providing especially tight binding for the heterocyclic ring of a terminal proline residue. A similar pocket for the penultimate amino acid residue was postulated, and the published data suggested a rather stringent steric requirement, since the D form of the inhi bitor was substantially more potent than its stereoisomer or the 3 methyl and unsubstituted analogs.The sulfhydryl group on the inhibitor, postulated to be bound at the active site near the catalytic center, was believed to play a central role in inactivation of the enzyme by combining with the zinc moiety known to be essential for catalytic activity. Substituents on the sulfhydryl, such as a methyl group, and an S acetyl derivative, substantially reduced potency of the inhibitor. See Cushman, D.W., et al.,Biochemistry, supTa. In vitro study of the mechanism by which SU14225 and its analogs act to inhibit ACE has been somewhat hampered by the instability of these molecules under ambient conditions. For example, it has been observed that a fresh aqueous solution of concentration, e.g., 1 mg per ml of SQ14225 at a pH of about 8 becomes substantially less active upon standing for as little as 30 minutes, and that activity continues to decrease as the solution stands for longer periods. It is believed that this loss in activity is mainly the result of dimerization of SQ14Z25 occurring at the sulfhy dryl end groups, whereby a disulfide is formed which is la rgely inactive as an inhibitor.Since the free sulfhydryl group is highly reactive and may be readily oxidized to polar acidic moieties such as sulfone and sulfoxide groups, it may also be that the obserived in vitro loss of activity of aqueous solutions of SQ14225 on standing is in some part a consequ pence of one or more such oxidation reactions, with formation of sulfone or sulfoxide which does not function effectively as an inhibitor for ACE. Such reports of SQ14225 clinical testing as are clirrently available, some of which refer to the compound urder the name Captopril , suggest that the product is sufficiently stable in the normal gastric and intestinal environments of most patients to be an effective inhibitor for ACE when administered orally. It is not yet clear, however, whether there may be a group of patients for which SQ14225 is substantially ineffective. Because of the high reactivity of the free sulfhydryl groups serum, could readily form mixed disulfides with SQ14225, cellular pro tein s, peptides or other free sulfhydryl group containing substances in the gastric or intestinal environments, in addition to the possibility for dimer formation or oxidative degradation reactions.A mixed disulfide with protein may be antigenic and, indeed, occasion al allergic reactions have been clinically observed. See Gavras, et al., kew England J. Med. 298,991 1978 . Disulfides and oxidative degradaticiaproducts of SQ14225 if formed, may at best be expected to be largely ineffective as inhibitors. It may be postulated accordingly that dose response to acylation may vary with conditions of administration and among individual patients. Moreover, in at least some patients, unwanted side effects may occur and maintenance of an effective concentration of the inhibitor in the body may be difficult to control. Thioester comp ounds generally are thought to be highly reactive in that the thioester linkage is readily hydrolyzable to a sulfhydryl moiety and a carboxylic moiety. Thioesters are accordingly often. used as active ester intermediates for groups, as under mild conditions. Such tyrocidin e.g, acetylthio have been used as. blo cking groups in the above cited Ondetti, et al. patents. Thioester intermediates are also postulated to occur in. the biosynthesis of cyclic peptides such as See or gramicidin. S. Lipmann, F, in Accounts Chem. Res. 6, 367 1973 . Compounds related to SQ14225 have been disclosed by Ondetti, et al., U.S. Patents 4,046,889, 4,052,511, 4,053,651, 4,113,715 and 4,154,840. Of interest are disclosed analogs of SQ14225 having the five membered heterocyclic ring of proline replaced by a four or a sixmembered ring. The inhibitory potencies of such analogs relative to SQ14225 are not disclosed Substitu tion ofD proline for L proline is reported to drastically reduce inhibitory potency of 3 mercapto propanoyl amino acids Cushma, D.W., et al., supra . To date, the effect of the amino acid to the left of the sulfur in the thioester compounds has not been determined. It is thought that this amino acid functions as an additional recognition site for the enzyme. If this is true, it would be expected that a compound with an amino acid here would be a better inhibitor. Applicants have found that various amino acids are effective and that the hydroxypro lines, pruline L , and D.L 3,4 dehydroproline, thiazolidine 4 carboxylic acid and L 5 oxo proline derivatives are all effective anti hypertensive agents and have high inhibitory potency for ACE. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a plurality of methods for preparing compounds having the formula EMI5.1 Formula I .wherein. R is hydrogen, formyl, acetyl, propanoyl, butanoly, phenylacetyl,phenylporpanoyl, benzoyl, cyclopentane carbonyl, tert butyloxycarbonyl, cyclopentanecarbonyl L lysyl, pyro L glutamyl L lysyl, L lysyl, L arginyl or pyro L glutamyl A is phenylalanyl, alanyl, trytophyl, tyrosyl, isoleucyl, leucyl, glycyl, histidyl, or valyl, the a amino group thereof being in amide linkage with R R1 is hydrogen or methyl R2 is L proline, L 3,4 dehydroproline, D,L 3,4 dehydrorroline, L 3 h ydroxyproline, L 4 hydroxyproline, L thia volidin e 4 carboxylic acid, or L 5 o xo proline, the imino group thereof being in. imide linkage with the adjacentEMI6.1 n is O or 1, such that when n is 0, R1 is methyl and where n 1 and R1 is methyl theEMI6.2 moiety is in the D configuration. These compounds are inhibitors of ACE and are use ful as orally effective anti hypertensive agents. For convenience, all of the following methods have been described in terms of the steps required to prepare the compound where R is benzoyl, A,is phenylalanyl, R1 is methyl,R2 is L proline and n is 1, i.e. N alpha 3 N alpha benzoylphenylanyl thio 2 D methylpropanoyl L proline. However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that other compounds can be made by substituting the desired groups for those used to illustrate the processes where appropriate. For example,L 3, 4 denydroproline, D,L 3,4 dehydroprolne, L 3 hydroxyproline, L 4 hydroxyproline, L thiazolidine 4 carboxylic acid or L 5 oxo proline can be substituted for L proline in all of the methods described below. All of the amino acids listed for A can be similarly substituted for phenylalanine in these methods.Other desired compounds can be made by making the appropriate substitutions unless indicated otherwise below.
