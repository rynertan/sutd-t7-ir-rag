# Self setting or water settable isocyanate compositions and methods for their formation.

## Abstract
Self setting compositions are formed by bringing into admixture an organic polyisocyanate, a non ionic surface active agent devoid of isocyanate reactive groups, an alkaline filler and water. Preferred alkaline fillers are portland cement, calcium oxide and hydrated lime. A plasticiser is preferably incorporated in the composition. Waste material, for example liquid or particulate radioactive wastes may be formed into a self setting composition for consolidation and disposal. A particulate extender may be incorporated in the self setting composition to give a product useful for example as a floor screed or cavity filler.
