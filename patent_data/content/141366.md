# RAPID RATE SINTERING OF CERAMICS

## Abstract
High strength, fine grain multi phase substantially crys talline sintered ceramic bodies are produced by a process comprising the steps of cold pressing, followed by sintering at a high temperature, the temperature increase to maximum sintering temperature being accomplished by the use of a heating rate in excess of about 100 C minute.
