# GAS SENSORS AND METHODS OF THEIR FABRICATION GAS SENSORS AND METHODS OF THEIR FABRICATION

## Abstract
A gas sensor has a detector element of tin IV oxide and either aluminium silicate or bismuth oxide. Palladium II chloride may be included with the aluminium silicate. Where aluminium silicate is included the sensor is selectively sensitive to methane. Where bismuth oxide is included the sensor is selectively sensitive to carbon monoxide. The constituents of the detector element may be mixed in powdered form with distilled water to form a paste which is applied across a pair of platinum electrode pads on an alumina substrate and sintered. A separate heater element may also be provided.
