# INDUSTRIAL MANIPULATOR

## Abstract
An industrial manipulator, e.g. electric robot, is provided having a self contained, closed system counter balance means for applying a gravity countering force to a load carry ing driven member 15, 55, 61 which is movable up and down. The self contained, closed system, hydro pneumatic counter balance means comprise an accumulator 19, 51, 72 , having a variable volume of compressed air applying a force to a hydraulic oil, in closed circuit fluid connection 20, 40, 52, 74 to a hydraulic cylinder charged with hydraulic oil and having a piston rod 23, 32, 54, 67 linked to the driven member 15, 55, 61 for applying a gravity countering forces to the member. Motion of the driven member 15, 55, 61 pro duces a variation in the volume of compressed air and, there fore, the pressure of the compressed air in the accumulator 19, 51, 72 exerting a force on the hydraulic oil. Advantage ously, the robot does not require an external source of pres surised fluid and external controls for operating the gravity countering means.
