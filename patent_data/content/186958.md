# Digital data processor for matrix vector multiplication.

## Abstract
A digital data processor for matrix vector multiplication is provided, and comprises a systolic array 10 of bit level, synchronously clock activated processing cells 12 each con nected to its row and column neighbours. On each clock cycle, each cell 12 multiplies an input bit of a respective vector coefficient by a respective matrix coefficient equal to 1, 1 or 0, and adds it to cumulative sum and carry input bits. Input vector coefficient bits pass along respective array rows through one cell 12 per clock cycle. Contributions to matrix vector product bits are accumulated in array columns. Input to and output from the array 10 is bit serial, word parallel, lsb leading, and temporally skewed. Transforms such as the discrete Fourier transform may be implemented by a two channel device 150 , in which each channel contains two processors of the invention with an inter vening bit serial multiplier. Processors of the invention may be replicated to implement multuplication by larger matrices.
