# Label machine and method for forming tape sections from an endless tape strip.

## Abstract
A label machine for forming individual labels 36 from an endless tape strip 31 . The machine includes a novel label removal device 15 which uses compressed air to insure removal of each label to a collection station 16 after it is cut from the endless strip, thereby pre venting hang up of labels at the machine s cutter as sembly 26 . The machine also includes a novel tape feed mechanism that provides accurate label length con trol, thereby preventing waste of tape. These mechanisms are preferably used in combination with a printer head, the novel tape feed and label removal mechanisms co operating to prevent printing errors between leading and trailing labels cut from the endless tape strip.
