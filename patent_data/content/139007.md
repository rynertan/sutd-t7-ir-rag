# APPARATUS FOR FORMING CONTINUOUS BODY WITH HOLE.

## Abstract
Apparatus for forming a continuous body 98 which has at least one hole 99 . The apparatus consists of a tubular member 13 of a cross sectional configuration such that it defines the outer peripheral surface of the continuous body a hole forming member 15 which fits the hole and a material delivering means 27 which delivers a material 95 such as resin mortar which can be forced into the area between the tubular member and the hole forming member, so that it sets there integrally. As the tubular member and the hole forming member advance, a continous body formed by the set material is left behind. At least the portion of the hole forming member behind a predetermined position can be rotated by a driving device 18 , to make it possible to prevent the material combining with the hole forming member.
