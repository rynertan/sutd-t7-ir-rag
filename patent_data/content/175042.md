## Description
System for differential discharge of suspended toilet tanksThe invention concerns a system for discharge of suspended toilet tanks, whether incorporated in the toilet or on the wall, able to effect differential water discharges.The current applicant has a previous patent, deposited in Italy as no. 48198 A 82, which claims the realization of a siphon system for high toilet tanks characterized by the fact that pressing the Pneumatic button cuases only a few liters of water to be discharged first, sufficient for cleaning the toilet by removing urine only, and that pressing said button again causes complete discharge of the entire tank, in case a complete cleaning is required.The aim of this invention is to realize the same function of differential discharge so as to achieve a considerable saving of water for any type of suspended tank system, characterized by a structure completely different from that of the siphon system and so unable to make use of the typical functional solutions of the siphon systems. This aim is achieved with a system consisting of a preferably cylindrical body, equipped at the base with a float ring or the like, in correspondence to the opening for water discharge to the toilet, said body having mounted on it a structure, with its own float ring, which can block the upper opening of the cylindrical body itself and is equipped with a hook lever or the like, operated by a float so that on pulling up the discharge cord typical of suspended systems, following the floating of said hook lever, operated by the float on the water filling the tank, only the upper structure is raised and so water is discharged only from the filling level of the tank at the upper edge of the cylindrical body, corresponding to only a few liters however letting said cord fall back allows the upper structure to be joined to the cylindrical body, with the result that a successive discharge operation performed by another pull up on the cord, cause both componenets tb be raised up and so the water outlet to be opened on the bottom of the tank, with conseauent discharge of the entire contents.Said pulling up of the cord may be effected, in low suspended tanks, that is incorporated in the toilet, with a known knob or button system, and in high wall tanks, with a nylon cord device or the like, operated by a lever, which can advantageously replace the traditional pneumatic system, which has a button which is too rigid and so difficult to operate.In one variation, the added float may act on a two component multiple lever instead of the hook lever, so as to cause the direct differential opening of the seal plug of the tank, causing in succession first the discharge oft few liters of water and then the total discharge, with no need for the presence of said cylindrical body and said upper structure.The invention is shown in two exemplificative and non limiting embodiments in the attached figures, which show figure 3, the complete axonometric vi.ew of the embodiment with the hook lever float figures 2, 3 and 4 axonometric views √èf the operational phases of the embodimetn in figure 1 figure 5, the schematic view of the embodiment in the previous figures, with a button to operate a nylon pull cord figures 6, 7, 8 and 9, side views of the operational phases of the embodiment with the multiple lever float.Figures 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 show in detail the cylindrical body 1 with float ring 2 or other structure, equipped with upper edge 3, closed with an internal seal, from the corresponding lower edge of structure 4, with float ring 5, to which is attaehed the hook lever 7, connected to rod 8 of float 9 the cord 10 allows elements 1 and 4 to be pulled up, sliding vetically around central axis 11, in order to discharge water, in succession, through the upper edge 3 and the discharge outlet 12 on the bottom of the tank 13.By means of a linear shift or of rotation, the outer lever 14 causes a nylon steel or similar cord to be pulled down, sliding in sheath 15, allowing the cord 10 to be raised and so the system to be operated in the high tank 13 variant.In the embodiment in figures 6, 7,8 and 9, the float 9 is connected to linear lever 16 which, by means of its shaped end 17, regulates the position and operation of the coupled 1 near lever 18, which with its end groove 19 acts on ball 20, at the top of the vertical rod 21 for raising and lowering the top with cord 10 or the like, in order to close the discharge outlet 12 of the tank 13.The operation of the invention in the embodiment shown in figures 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 may be described as follows in rest conditions, the float 9 is raised by the level to which the tank 13 is filled, as in figure 2, and since it is connected by rod 8 to the hook lever 7 it causes rotation around the fulcrumand so the release of structure 4 with respect to cylindrical body 1, so that raising the cord 10, directly in low tanks or by means of button or external lever 14 and the nylon cord in high ones, causes only structure 4 to be raised, as in figure 3, effecting discharge of the liquid present from the level to which the tank 13 is filled to the upper edge 3 of the cylindrical body 1, corresponding to a few liters sufficient for the elimination of urine from the toilet.When said cord 10 is released, the known device for filling the tank 13 restores the maximum level i a few seconds, preparingthe system for a new discharge of limited size.On the other hand, a second pull on the cord 10 after the first causes the hook lever 7, no longer supported and inclined by the float 9, to fall vertical by the force of gravity, leading to attachment to the edge 3 of the cylindrical body 1, and tb coupling with the upper structure 4 so that both are raised, uncovering the opening of discharge outlet 12 through which all the water is discharged, while floats 2 and 5 support said elements 1 and 4 during the fall of the water. In the embodiments shown in figures 6, 7, 8 and 9, raising rod 21 in a known and traditionalvzv causes the ball 20 to strike the end groove 19 of lever 18 and rotate around the fulcrum of lever 18 itself, which is in contact on the other end with the end 17 of lever 16, which however, having float 9 on the other side comprising a ball moveable around a lower rotation point, when the water level drops as it is discharged from opening 2 which is no longer closed by top 22, at a certain point falls by the force of gravity, since it is no longer supported by the water, and causes by means of lever 16 and coupled lever 18, a violent impulse downwards of ball 20 and so of rod 21, which pulling the top 22 closes the discharge opening 12 after having allowed the outlet of a small quantity of liquid. A second pull of rod 21, before the float 9 riseswith the level of the water up to the maximum value as in figure 8, causes complete discharge as in figure 9, when required.A further characteristic of the invention 8 consists of the possibility of adjusting the body 1 with respect to the float ring 2, and analogously of that of structure 4 with respect to float 5, or the position of lever 16 with respect to its support, in order to vary the height with respect to the Claims 1. System for differential discharge comprising two hollow structures sliding around a central axis so that a first pull upwards raises only the upper portion to cause discharge of the water present in the tank up to the upper edge of the lower portion, and the consequent fall of a hook lever, no longer supported by its float so that a subsequent pull after a short time, causes the coupled rise of the two portions, connected by said hook, to allow complete discharge. 2. System for differential discharge according to claim 1 characterized by the presence of the cylindrical body 1 with float ring 2 or other structure , equipped with upper edge 3, closed with an internal seal, from the corresponding lower edge of structure 4, with float ring 5, to which is attached the hook lever 7, connected to rod 8 of float 9 the cord 10 allows elements 1 and 4 to be pulled up, sliding vertically around central axis 11, in order to discharge water, in succession, through the upper edge 3 and the discharge outlet 12 on the bottom of the tank 13.
