## Description
The present invention relates to anti viral use of certain pyrimidine derivatives and to such novel derivatives. U.K. Patent Specification No. 1523865 and U.S. Patent No. 4,199,574 describe a broad class of purine derivatives containing an acyclic side chain in the 9 position, i.e., the position normally occupied by a sugar moiety in a purine nucleoside. These derivatives have been found to have antiviral activity against several DNA viruses of the herpes virus group, including herpes simplex, varicella zoster and Epstein Barr viruses. Among these derivatives, 9 2 hydroxyethoxymethyl guanine otherwise known as acyclovir has been found to have particularly good activity against herpes simplex viruses both On the other hand a number of pyrimidine derivatives having the same acyclic chain as acyclovir in the 1 position, i.e. the position normally occupied by a sugar moiety in a pyrimidine nucleoside, have been reported as having little or no activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 It has now surprisingly been found that 1 2 hydroxy 1 hydroxymethyl methoxymethyl cytosine, which may be represented by the formula I and its physiologically acceptable salts and esters thereof including physiologically acceptable salts of such esters , are useful in the treatment of certain viral infections as described below. Physiologically acceptable salts of the compound of formula I which may be conveniently used in therapy include physiologically acceptable salts of organic acids such as lactic, acetic, malic or p toluenesulphuric acid as well as physiologically acceptable salts of mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid. The compound of formula I and the physiologically acceptable salts and esters and salts of such esters thereof are especialy useful in the treatment of diseases caused by various DNA viruses, and in particular cytomegalovirus CMV , Epstein Barr virus EBV , varicella zoster virus VZV and Hepatitis B virus. CMV causes encephalitis, mental retardation, blindness and deafness in newborns, pneumonitis in bone marrow transplant recipients and renal transplant recipients, thrombocytopenia purpura, CMV mononucleosis and hepatitis EBV causes infectious mononucleosis VZV causes chicken pox, pneumonitis, encephalitis, intravascular coagulopathy, disseminated zoster, hepatitis, shingles and keratitis. Hepatitis B virus is a DNA virus which is one of the causative agents of human hepatitis. In addition to its use in human medical therapy the compound of formula I its salts, esters and salts of such esters can be administered to other animals for the treatment or prophylaxis of viral diseases, e.g. in other mammals. The method herein includes inhibiting the replication of CMV, EBV or VZV or hepatitis B virus in host cells of a mammal which comprises applying an effective virus replication inhibiting amount of the compound of formula I , or a physiologically acceptable salt or ester and salts of such esters thereof, to the infected cells. According to a further feature of the present invention there is provided the compound of formula I and physiologically acceptable salts and esters and salts of such esters thereof for use in the therapy, e.g., treatment or prophylaxis, of a viral disease in an animal, e.g., a mammal such as man. The compound of formula I or its physiologically acceptable salts, esters and salts of such esters may be prepared by any of the methods known in the art for the preparation of the same or similar compounds e.g. as described hereinafter. The invention further provides the use of the compound of formula I or its physiologically acceptable salts, esters and salts of such esters in the manufacture of a medication for the treatment of DNA virus infections, particularly hepatitis B, VZV, EBV or CMV. It has also surprisingly been found that oral administration of an ester, particularly the dipivalate ester, of the compound of formula I gives rise to substantially higher body fluid levels of the compound of formula I than does the oral administration of the compound of formula I itself, as demonstrated by urine levels in mice and rats. The present invention further provides as novel compounds the physiologically acceptable esters of the compound of formula I and physiologically acceptable salts of such esters. The novel compounds of this aspect of the invention may be represented for example by formula II wherein R¹ and R² may be the same or different and each is selected from hydrogen and COR wherein R is selected from hydrogen, branched or straight chain or cyclic including polycyclic alkyl containing 1 12 carbons, phenyl or naphthyl α or β wherein said phenyl and naphthyl may be substituted with 1 3 substituents selected from C₁ ₄ alkyl, C₁ ₄ alkoxy and halo, providing that only one of R¹ and R² may be hydrogen, or R¹ and R² together with the oxygens to which they are attached form a carbonate moiety, and physiologically acceptable salts thereof. Preferred compounds of formula II are those wherein R¹ and R² are COR and R is branched or straight chain alkyl containing 1 8 carbons or phenyl optionally substituted with 1 3 substituents selected from C₁ ₄ alkyl, C₁ ₄ alkoxy and halo, and physiologically acceptable salts thereof. Most preferred are those compounds of formula II wherein R¹ and R² are COR and R is branched or straight chain alkyl containing 1 4 carbons, e.g. As used herein halo includes fluoro, chloro and bromo. Salts of the compound of formula II which may be conveniently used in therapy include physiologically acceptable salts of organic acids such as lactic, acetic, malic or p toluenesulphonic acid as well as physiologically acceptable salts of mineral acids such as hydrochloric or sulphuric acid. In a further aspect of the present invention is provided the use of compounds of formula II or physiologically acceptable salts thereof in the manufacture of a medication for the treatment of DNA virus infections, particularly VZV, EBV, CMV and hepatitis B virus infections. The compounds of formula II may be prepared in conventional manner, e.g., using techniques as described in the Examples. The present invention further provides a process for the preparation of compounds of formula II as defined above and physiologically acceptable salts thereof which comprises With regard to process a above, the group X is advantageously a halo group, and the reaction is conveniently effected under basic conditions, e.g., in the presence of potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide. With regard to process b , this may involve for example In the case of i , the precursor group R³ may be for example an azido group which can be converted into the desired amino group by catalytic hydrogenation preferably in the presence of palladium charcoal, for example in an organic solvent medium such as methanol. The azido compound may be prepared for example from either a a corresponding alkylthio e.g., methylthio or alkylsulfonyl compound by reaction with an alkali metal e.g., sodium azide in an organic solvent medium such as aqueous ethanol, conveniently at an elevated temperature, e.g., up to about 80 C, or b a corresponding halo e.g., chloro compound by reaction with an alkali metal e.g., lithium azide in an organic solvent medium such as dimethylformamide conveniently at room temperature. Further alternatives for the precursor group R³ include for example With regard to process c , this may be effected for example by treatment of the compound of formula VI with a xanthine oxidase enzyme. The compound of formula VI may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula with a compound of formula IV under appropriate conditions, e.g., in dimethylformamide solution. With regard to process d , this may comprise for example, esterification or transesterification of a compound of formula I , as hereinbefore defined, with an appropriate esterifying agent, e.g., an acid halide preferably chloride or anhydride, in a basic medium such as dimethylformamide pyridine, or when transesterification is to be effected a lower alkyl ester in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate. When the desired ester of formula II is the carbonate, process d is conveniently used wherein reaction is effected between a compound of formula I and phosgene in a basic medium or a dialkyl carbonate in the presence of a base. Alternatively Y in formula VII may each represent a halogen atom and the compound of formula VII is reacted with an excess of a compound formula MOCOR in which M represents an alkali metal such as potassium, conveniently in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide at an elevated temperature. As a further alternative Y may each represent an optionally substituted e.g. nitro substituted benzyloxy group which may be converted into the desired group by treatment with the appropriate acid anhydride of formula RCO ₂O, conveniently in the presence of a Lewis acid. With regard to process e this may be effected for example by reaction of a compound of formula wherein R is as defined above with a compound of formula conveniently in the presence of an alkali metal alkoxide such as sodium ethoxide. The compound of formula I and its physiologically acceptable salts and esters including physysiologically acceptable salts of such esters hereafter collectively referred to as the active ingredients may be administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated, suitable routes including oral, rectal, nasal, topical including buccal and sublingual , vaginal and parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural . It will be appreciated that the preferred route may vary with, for example, the condition of the recipient. For each of the above indicated utilities and indications the amount required of an active ingredient as above defined will depend upon a number of factors including the severity of the condition to be treated and the identity of the recipient and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. In general, however, for each of these utilities and indications, a suitable, effective dose will be in the range 0.1 to 250 mg per kilogram body weight of recipient per day, preferably in the range 1 to 100 mg per kilogram body weight per day and most preferably in the range 5 to 20 mg per kilogram body weight per day an optimum dose is about 15 mg per kilogram body weight per day unless otherwise indicated all weights of active ingredient are calculated as the parent compound of formula I for salts thereof the figures would be increased proportionately. The desired dose is preferably presented as two, three, four or more sub doses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day. These sub doses may be adminstered in unit dosage forms, for example, containing 10 to 1000 mg, preferably 20 to 500 mg and most preferably 100 to 400 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form. While it is possible for the active ingredients to be administered alone it is preferable to present them as pharmaceutical formulations. The formulations, both for veterinary and for human use, of the present invention comprise at least one active ingredient, as above defined, together with one or more acceptable carriers thereof and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier s must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipients thereof. The formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical including buccal and sublingual , vaginal or parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient as a powder or granules as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non aqueous liquid or as an oil in water liquid emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste. A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. For infections of the eye or other external tissues, e.g., mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient in an amount of, for example, 0.075 to 20 w w, preferably 0.2 to 15 w w and most preferably 0.5 to 10 w w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil in water cream base. If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example, at least 30 w w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e. an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3 diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Example of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethylsulphoxide and related analogues. The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier otherwise known as an emulgent , it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier s with or without stabilizer s make up the so called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and or fat make up the so called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations. Emulgents and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the present invention include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono stearate and sodium lauryl sulphate. The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties, since the solubility of the active compound in most oils likely to be used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations is very low. Thus the cream should preferably be a non greasy, non staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono or dibasic alkyl esters such as di isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2 ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the last three being preferrred esters. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required. Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils can be used. Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is preferably present in such formulations in a concentration of 0.5 to 20 , advantageously 0.5 to 10 particularly about 1.5 w w. Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavoured basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia and mouth washes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier. Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate. Formulations suitable for nasal administration wherein the carrier is a solid include a coarse powder having a particle size for example in the range 20 to 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration as for example a nasal spray or as nasal drops, include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient. Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient and aqueous and non aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit dose or multi dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze dried lyophilized condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient. It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above the formulations of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavouring agents.

In antiviral tests the compound of formula I was found to have surprisingly good activity against CMV, EBV and VZV. A mixture of 5.1 g 0.013 M of 2 bromomethoxy 1,3 bis 0 benzoyl glycerol, 2.2 g 0.013 M of 2,4 diethoxypyrimidine in 26 ml of dry dichloromethane and 1.98 g 0.014 M anhydrous potassium carbonate was stirred at room temperature overnight. The mixture was filtered and the inorganic salts washed with benzene. The combined filtrate and washings were evaporated The clear oil was heated in a bomb with 80 ml of freshly prepared, saturated methanolic ammonia at 95 C for 18 hours. The evaporated mixture was purified by column chromatography on silica gel. Elution with 5 methanol in dichloromethane yielded, on evaporation, 1.1 g of benzamide. Elution with 1 1 methanol dichloromethane, gave on evaporation, 2.0 g of solid which on recrystallization from ethanol acetonitrile yielded 1.75 g of 1 2 hydroxy 1 hydroxymethyl ethoxymethyl cytosine, mp 145 148 C, 67 yield . The compound gave satisfactory elemental analysis and the C¹³ NMR and ultraviolet spectra were consistent with the desired structure. A mixture of 2.0 g 1.31 x 10 ² M of N⁴ acetylcytosine, 1.33 g of ammonium sulfate and 90 ml of hexamethyldisilazane was refluxed under nitrogen with stirring for 18 hours. The excess solvent was removed by flash evaporation and the residual oil dissolved in 50 ml of dry benzene. To this solution was added 5.15 g 1.31x10 ²M of 2 bromomethoxy 1,3 bis 0 benzoyl glycerol and the resulting orange solution refluxed on a steam bath for 18 hours. The reaction solution was evaporated A mixture of cytosine 0.666 g and hexamethyldisilazane 4.5 ml was refluxed one hour under nitrogen with magnetic stirring. The resulting clear solution was evaporated A mixture of 1,3 dichloro 2 methoxymethoxy propane 181.1 g , potassium acetate 308 g , and 18 crown 6 19.0 g in dry dimethylsulfoxide 500 ml was stirred at 77 C for 18 hours. The resulting two phase system was cooled to room temperature, which caused the lower layer to partially solidify. The mixture was filtered and the filtrate evaporated To a cooled 0 C solution of 2 methoxymethoxy 1,3 propanediyl diacetate 25.0 g in acetic anhydride 33.1 ml was added dropwise boron trifluoride etherate 5.2 ml over a 10 minute period. The resultant yellow solution was stirred 5 hours at 0 C and then poured into a suspension of sodium bicarbonate 29.5 g in H₂O 200 ml at 0 C. The mixture was stirred until the foaming subsided, then extracted four times with 100 ml portions of ether. The combined ethereal extracts were washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to give a yellow oil 21.3 g 75 . The ¹H NMR spectrum was consistent with the desired product, 2 acetoxymethoxy 1,3 propanediyl diacetate. A solution of 2 acetoxymethoxy 1,3 propanediyl diacetate 21.3 g , trimethylsilybromide 46 ml and dry dichloromethane 200 ml was refluxed for 18 hours. The solution was flash evaporated to yield 21.5 g 93 of a pale yellow liquid whose ¹H NMR spectrum was consistent with the desired structure, 2 bromomethoxy 1,3 propanediyl diacetate. A mixture of cytosine 1.03 g and hexamethyldisilazane 6.7 ml was refluxed for 1.75 hours. The solution was evaporated A mixture of 1,3 dichloro 2 methoxymethoxy propane 17.3 g , potassium pivalate 56.1 g and dry dimethylsulfoxide 400 ml was stirred with heating at 70 C internal temperature for 18 hours. After standing at room temperature for four days, the mixture was filtered and the filtrate evaporated A solution of 2 methoxymethoxy 1,3 propanediyl dipivalate 29.0 g and acetic anhydride 11 ml was chilled in an ice bath to 0 C, and boron trifluoride ethereate 2.86 ml was added dropwise to the solution with stirring at 0 C over a 3 hour period. A solution was poured into 160 ml ice and water containing 128 g of sodium bicarbonate. The mixture was stirred until the ice melted and then extracted three times with equal volumes of ether. The combined ether extracts were washed with a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate, and the ethereal layer dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated at 60 C. The resulting colorless oil, 2 acetoxymethoxy 1,3 propanediyl dipivalate 26.4 g, 84 , was analysed by ¹H and ¹³C NMR and showed 99 purity. A solution of 2 acetoxymethoxy 1,3 propanediyl dipivalate 26.4 g , dry dichloromethane 124 ml and trimethylsilyl bromide 30.1 ml was refluxed for two hours, then evaporated A mixture of cytosine 6.5 g and hexamethyldisilazane 43 ml was refluxed with magnetic stirring for one hour. The solution was evaporated The compound of formula II was administered to 28 male CD 1 mice by gavage. The dose was 44.5 mg per kg of body weight and was in suspension in 5 Tween 80 at a concentration of 5 mg ml. No signs of toxicity were observed in any of the mice. Tablets were prepared from the foregoing ingredients by wet granulation followed by compression. Confluent monolayers of human diploid fibroblast cells i.e., human foreskin fibroblast cells were infected with 200 300 µL of a suspension containing 50 100 human CMV infectious virions per culture well and allowed to incubate for 90 minutes at 37 degrees C in a CO₂ incubator. Unadsorbed virus was then removed by aspiration and appropriate concentrations of 1 2 hydroxy 1 hydroxymethyl ethoxymethyl cytosine were added in Eagle s Minimal Essential Media containing 2 fetal calf serum in an agarose overlay 0.6 . The assay plates were incubated at 37 degrees C in a CO₂ incubator for 8 days to allow plaque development. The monolayers were then fixed with 10 formalin in phosphate buffered saline and stained wth 0.8 crystal violet. The plaques were counted at 3x magnification using a Bausch and Lomb dissecting microscope, and the data were analysed by SAS Probit SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, N.C., U.S.A. to give the following results 1 2 Hydroxy 1 hydroxymethyl ethoxymethyl cytosine was assayed for activity against Epstein Barr Virus EBV using an adaptaion of the procedure described in
