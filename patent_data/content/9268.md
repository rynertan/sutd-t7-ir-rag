# Process for cross linking shaped non polar synthetic resins and electric objects insulated with said crosslinked resins.

## Abstract
Non polar synthetic resins are cross linked by mixing the resin with a peroxide having a formula illustrated in the accompanying drawing and exposing the mixture to a high frequency alternating current field in the absence of any polar auxiliary substance other than said peroxide. The polymers thus cured have favourable electrical properties and are very suitable to be used as insulating material for electrical cables.
