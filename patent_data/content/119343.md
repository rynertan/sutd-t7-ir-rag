# Turbine engine seal and method for repair thereof.

## Abstract
A method for repairing turbine engine seals and a product manufactured in accordance with the method are provided. A worn or damaged honeycomb seal is removed from a backing plate together with a portion of the surface of the plate. The plate is restored to substantially its original thickness by a low pressure plasma spraying operation which may be followed by further machining to arrive at the required plate thickness. A new seal is then brazed thereon. The finished product will include the backing plate 12 , a low pressure plasma sprayed coated surface 32 and a honeycomb seal 14 brazed to the coated surface.
