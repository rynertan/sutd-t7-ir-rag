# Cartridge respirator with service life indicator.

## Abstract
Improvements in respirators and particularly in respir ators containing visually observable indicator means for indicating the end of the service life of respirator cartridges for use in atmospheres containing hazardous vapors and or gases are disclosed. The present invention utilizes a colorimetric indicator in sheet form which is positioned along the inner transparent sidewall 14 of the respirator cartridge 12 . This indicator reveals the remaining capacity of the entire sorbent bed 24 rather than the condition of a small volume near the probe or window. The colorimetric indicators in the present invention undergo irreversible color changes when subjected to the gases to be detected.
