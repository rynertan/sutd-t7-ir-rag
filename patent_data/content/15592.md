# Light sensitive silver halide materials comprising fluorine containing surfactants.

## Abstract
Fluorine containing surfactants according to formula Rf X n A L Z wherein Rf is a short chain fluorine con taining group derived from hexafluoropropylene or trifluoro chloroethylene, X is O , S , or SO₂ , n is at least 2, the Rf groups being same or different, L is a monovalent bond or a bivalent bridging group such as COO alkylene, CONR¹ alkylene or SO₂NR¹ alkylene, wherein R¹ is hy drogen or C₁ C₅ alkyl, and Z represents a hydrophilic polyoxyethylene group or a hydrophilic group such as
