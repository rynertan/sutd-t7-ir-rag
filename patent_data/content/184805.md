## Description
The present invention relates to a demodulator and, more particularly, to a demodulator for demodulating a quadrature amplitude modulated signal. A quadrature amplitude modulation QAM system features a unique capability of transmitting a large amount of data per unit frequency of the occupied bandwidth of a carrier passband and, for this reason, it has been extensively used for large capacity radio communications in which the occupied frequency bandwidth is severely restricted. EP A 01188119 relates to a demodulator for demodulating a QAM signal including an orthogonal detector which detects a four phase modulated signal, which is one of QAM signals, to produce two demodulated signals, and two analog to digital AD converters which discriminate respectively the two demodulated signals responsive to a clock to produce two different data signals each. The data signals from one of the AD converters and the clock are applied to a control circuit which then generates a control signal. A voltage controlled oscillator VCO oscillates the clock having a frequency which is controlled by the control signal. Of the two data signals outputted by each of the AD converters, at least one serves as an error signal representative of a deviation of the value of the associated demodulated signal at a sampling point of the AD converter from a normal value normal level . In a demodulator designed for use with QAM signals, the influence of insignificant deviations of the sampling point may be compensated for by use of an adaptive transversal equalizer of the type described in, for example, Papers dedicated to The 1984 National Meeting of The Communications Section of The Institute of Electronics and Communication Engineers of Japan, Fascicle 3 1984 10 , pp. 3 23 and 24. An adaptive transversal equalizer is capable of compensating for distortions due to delay and attenuation in a transmission path by automatic control and in conformity to particular conditions of the transmission path. The tap constant of such a special equalizer is determined by use of the previously mentioned error signal. Where the prior art demodulator is used in combination with an adaptive transversal equalizer, the above stated error signal bifunctions as an error signal adapted to control a clock synchronizing circuit of the demodulator and an error signal adapted to control the equalizer. In such a condition, a control loop associated with the demodulator and a control loop associated with the equalizer affect each other to become astatic, the equalizer significantly deteriorating the demodulation eye pattern. Stated another way, should the prior art demodulator be used together with an adaptive transversal equalizer, the control over the demodulator and that over the equalizer might each be prevented from converging to the optimum point. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a modulator which is free from the above described drawback and operable normally even if used with an adaptive transversal equalizer. It is another object of the present invention to provide a generally improved demodulator. A demodulator for demodulating a quadrature amplitude modulated signal of the present invention comprises an othogonal detector for detecting the quadrature amplitude modulated signal to produce a first and a second demodulated signals, a first clock generator for regenerating a signal which is synchronous to a clock out of transition points of the quadrature amplitude modulated signal or the first demodulated signal, a first phase shifter for shifting a phase of an output signal of the first clock generator to produce a first clock signal, a first analog to digital converter for discriminating the first demodulated signal responsive to the first clock signal to produce a first group of data signals, a second clock generator for producing a second clock signal a frequency or a phase of which is controlled by a control signal, a second analog to digital converter for discriminating the second demodulated signal responsive to the second clock signal to produce a second group of data signals, and a control circuit for gating and logically processing the second group of data signals to produce the control signal. In accordance with the present invention, a demodulator for demodulating a QAM signal which is usable in combination with an adaptive transversal equalizer is provided. Controls over the demodulator and the equalizer are each converged to an optimum point so that the sampling points of two analog to digital converters of the demodulator are optimumly controlled. For a limited occupied bandwidth of a carrier passband, a large amount of data may be transmitted with distortions due to delay and attenuation inherent in a transmission path compensated for. The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description taken with the accompanying drawings.

While the demodulator of the present invention is susceptible of numerous physical embodiments, depending upon the environment and requirements of use, substantial numbers of the herein shown and described embodiments have been made, tested and used, and all have performed in an eminently satisfactory manner. To better understand the present invention, a brief reference will be made to a prior art demodulator, as known from EP A 0118119, shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, a prior art demodulator, generally 10, includes an orthogonal detector 12 for detecting a four phase modulated signal 1, to produce two level demodulated signals P₁ and Q₁. Two bit analog to digital AD converters 14 and 16 discriminate respectively the demodulated signals P₁, and Q₁, each responsive to a clock C, thereby each producing two data signals D₁, and E. The outputs D₁, and E of the AD converter 14 and the clock C are routed to a control circuit 18, which then produces a signal V₁. A voltage controlled oscillator VCO 20 oscillates the clock C having a frequency which is controlled by the signal V₁. The data signal D₁ is the major signal indicative of a particular one of two levels which the demodulated signal P₁, or Q₁ assumes at a sampling point of the AD converter 14 or 16 associated with the signals P₁, or Q₁. The data signal E, on the other hand, is representative of a deviation error of the value of the demodulated signal P₁, or Q₁, from a normal value normal level at the sampling point. The control circuit 18 and the VCO 20 in combination constitute a clock synchronizing circuit which logically manipulates the data signals D1 and E outputted by the AD converter 14 for setting up clock synchronization. This clock synchronizing circuit operates with the same principle as that of a clock synchronizing circuit which is disclosed in Papers of the 1984 National Meeting of the Communications Section of the Institute of Electronics and Communication Engineers of Japan, Fascicle 3 1984 10 , pp. 3 22. The control circuit 18 and the VCO 20 are operated as follows. The demodulated signal P₁ applied to the AD converter 14 has undergone some bandwidth limitation. Hence, when the sampling point of the AD converter 14 is deviated from the optimum one, the value of the demodulated signal is deviated from the normal value normal level so that the data signal E appears as an error signal. Assuming three sequential sampling points T In this particular example, the AD converter 16 is also clocked by the VCO 20. It sometimes occurs that the clocks in the demodulated signals P₁ and Q₁ become deviated in phase from each other due to incompleteness of a modulator, which produces the four phase modulated signal I₁. To cope with this occurrence, another set of control circuit 18 and VCO 20 may be installed and so arranged as to prepare a clock using the data signals D₁ and E outputted by the AD converter 16. This exclusive clock applied to the AD converter 16 will positively maintain the sampling points of both of the AD converters 14 and 17 at optimum ones. Meanwhile, an adaptive transversal equalizer of the previously stated kind is usable to compensate for distortions due to delay and attenuation in a transmission path by automatic control and in conformity to particular conditions of the transmission path. This type of equalizer also functions to compensate for insignificant deviations of the sampling point of a demodulator. An error signal for determining a tap constant of an adaptive transversal equalizer is implemented by the data signal E. As previously discussed, the problem with the use the demodulator 10 of Fig. 1 in combination with an adaptive transversal equalizer is that since both the error signal assigned to the clock synchronizing circuit of the demodulator 10 and the error signal assigned to the equalizer are implemented by the data signal E, a control loop of the demodulator and that of the equalizer affect each other to become astatic, the equalizer noticeably deteriorating the demodulation eye pattern. That is, where the prior art demodulator 10 and an adaptive transversal equalizer are used together, their associated controls often fail to converge to optimum points. Various embodiments of a demodulator in accordance with the present invention will be described which constitute a solution to the problem discussed above. Referring to Fig. 2A, a demodulator of the present invention is shown and generally designated by the reference numeral 30. The demodulator 30 includes an orthogonal detector 32 adapted to detect a four phase modulated signal I₁, which has been equalized by an adaptive transversal equalizer 34, to produce two level demodulated signals P₁ and Q₁. A clock generator 36 prepares a signal C₁ by regenerating signal components out of transition points of the demodulated signal P₁ which are synchronous to a clock. A phase shifter 38 shifts the signal C₁ to produce a clock signal C As shown in detail in Fig. 2B, the clock generator 36 is made up of a full wave rectifier 48 for rectifying the demodulated signal P₁, and a phase synchronizing circuit which is made up of a phase comparator 50, a low pass filter 52, and a VCO 54. The phase synchronizing circuit serves to produce the signal C₁ which is synchronous to a clock component contained in an output of the full wave rectifier 48. Since the demodulated signal P₁, although usually void of a line spectrum of a clock component, contains signal transition points with a certain probability, it allows a clock component to develop when subjected to non linear manipulation such as full wave rectification. For this reason, the clock generator 36 successfully regenerates the signal C₁ which is synchronous to the clock out of the transition points of the signal P₁. In Fig. 2A, the phase shifter 38 shifts the phase of the signal C₁ such that the phase of the clock C The equalizer 34 uses the two data signals outputted by the AD converters 40 and 42 as error signals. The control circuit 44 adapted to control the clock C Meanwhile, the phase of the clock C As described above, the construction shown in Fig. 2A allows both the adaptive transversal equalizer 34 and the demodulator 30 to operate each in a normal condition. Referring to Fig. 3, another embodiment of the present invention is shown in a block diagram. In Fig. 3, the same structural elements and signals as those shown in Figs. 2A and 2B are designated by like reference numerals and symbols. The demodulator 60 shown in Fig. 3 is exactly the same in construction and operation as the demodulator 30 of Figs. 2A and 2B except that it has an adaptive transversal equalizer 62 intervening between the orthogonal detector 32 and the AD converters 40 and 42, the equalizer 62 being operable in the baseband. In Fig. 3, while the clock generator 36 is shown as being supplied with the demodulated signal P₁ which has been equalized by the equalizer 62, its operation will not be effected even if the signal P₁ is replaced with the signal which has not been equalized. Referring to Fig. 4, another embodiment of the present invention is shown in a block diagram. A demodulator 70 of Fig. 4, too, is used in combination with an adaptive transversal equalizer, not shown. This particular embodiment differs from that of Fig. 2A in that it includes a clock generator 72 instead of the clock generator 36 and a phase shifter 74 instead of the VCO 46. Specifically, the clock generator 72 is configured by replacing the full wave rectifier 48 of the clock generator 36 of Fig. 2B with a circuit which subjects the four phase modulated signal I₁ to non linear manipulation such as envelope detection. Inasmuch as the four phase modulated signal, too, yields clock components when subjected to non linear manipulation, the clock generator 72 is capable of regenerating the signal C₁ which is synchronous to a clock out of the transition points of the signal I₁. The clock signal C₁ is applied to the phase shifter 38 to become a clock signal C Referring to Fig. 5, a demodulator in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention is shown and generally designated by the reference numeral 80. The demodulator 80, too, is used in combination with an adaptive transversal equalizer, not shown. This particular embodiment is essentially similar to that of Fig. 2A except that the VCO 46 is replaced with a fixed frequency oscillator 82 and a phase shifter 84. The output frequency of the fixed frequency oscillator 82 is substantially equal to the clock frequency. The phase shifter 84 is an infinite phase shifter whose phase shift value increases or decreases in proportion to time, the variation ratio of the phase shift value with respect to time being controlled by the signal V₁. Since the output of the oscillator 82 is controlled in phase by the phase shifter 84 whose variation ratio, as stated above, is controlled by the signal V₁, the phase of the clock signal C Referring to Fig. 6, another embodiment of the present invention is shown in a block diagram. In this particular embodiment, too, a demodulator 90 is used in combination with an adaptive transversal equalizer, not shown. The demodulator 90 is distinguished from the demodulator 30 of Fig. 2 by a clock generator 92 and a phase shifter 74 which are installed in place of the clock generator 36 and the VCO 46 of the latter. As shown, the clock generator 92 is made up of an inverter 94 for inverting the polarity of the signal C₁, a one bit AD converter 96 adapted to discriminate the demodulated signal P₁ responsive to an output of the inverter 94 to thereby produce a data signal F, a logic circuit 98 which produces a signal V₂ responsive to the data signal D₁ outputted by the AD converter 40, the data signal F, and the signal C₁, and a VCO 100 which produces the signal C₁ having a frequency which is controlled by the signal V₂. The phase shift value associated with the phase shifter 38 is controlled, along with the polarity inversion by the inverter 94, such that when the clock C The transition point of the demodulated signal P₁ is positioned intermediate between the optimum sampling points of the AD converter 40. Therefore, assuming that the sampling points of the AD converter 40 are optimumly timed, if the clock C As stated above, the signal V₂ serves as an error signal which responds to any deviation in the output of the inverter 94 from the transition point Applied to the VCO 100, the signal V₂ controls the output of the VCO 100, 1.e. C₁ such that the output of the inverter 94 is locked at the transition point, i.e., time T₀ T₁ 2, thereby synchronizing the signal C₁ to the clock. In short, the clock generator 92 shares the same function as the clock generator 36 of Fig. 2A in that it regenerates a signal C₁ which is synchronous to the demodulated signal P₁ out of the transition points of the demodulated signal P₁. Concerning the clock signal C Referring to Fig. 7, another embodiment of the present invention is shown. A demodulator 110 in accordance with this particular embodiment is used together with an adaptive transversal equalizer, not shown, and constructed to demodulate a sixteen level QAM signal I In the illustrative embodiment, the clock C Referring to Fig. 8, still another embodiment of the present invention is shown. In this particular embodiment, a demodulator 120 is combined with an adaptive transversal equalizer, not shorn, and used to demodulate a sixty four level QAM signal I In this particular embodiment, the demodulator 120 further comprises a carrier synchronizing circuit which gates the data signals D₁ and E from the AD converters 124 and 126 to produce a carrier synchronizing signal CS. As shown in detail in Fig. 9, the carrier synchronizing circuit 130 is made up of an exclusive OR gate 132 having two input terminals to which the data signal D₁ from the AD converter 128 and the data signal E from the AD converter 124 respectively are applied, an exclusive OR gate 134 having two input terminals to which the data signal D₁ from the AD converter 124 and the data signal E from the AD converter 126 respectively are applied, a subtractor 136 to which output signals of the exclusive OR gates 132 and 134 are delivered, a low pass filter 138 to which an output of the subtractor 136 is applied, and a VCO 140 controlled by an output of the filter 138 for generating the carrier synchronizing signal CS. The carrier synchronizing circuit per ce is well known in the art and, therefore, detaild description thereof will be omitted. Referring to Fig. 10, a farther embodiment of the present invention is shown. A demodulator 150 in this particular embodiment is applicable to a case wherein an adaptive transversal equalizer is not used. The demodulator 150 is constructed by replacing the VCO 46 and the phase shifter 38 of the embodiment of Fig. 2A with the phase shifter 74 and another phase shifter 152 which is identical in function with the phase shifter 74, and adding a control circuit 154 for controlling the phase shift value of the phase shifter 152. The control circuit 154 functions in the same manner as the control circuit 44. The control circuit 154 and the phase shifter 152 cooperate to optimumly control the sampling points of the AD converter 40, while the control circuit 44 and the phase shifter 74 cooperate to optimumly control the sampling points of the AD converter 42. As previously discussed in relation to the prior art demodulator, where the demodulator 150 of Fig. 10 is used in combination with an adaptive transversal equalizer, controls over both of them sometimes become astatic. Nevertheless, if the signal V₃ which is applied to the phase shifter 152 is replaced with a fixed voltage signal, the phase shifter 152 will share the same function as the phase shifter 38 of Fig. 2A and allow the demodulator 150 to operate in combination with an adaptive transversal equalizer without falling in astatic conditions. In the aspect of production, only demodulators having the particular configuration of Fig. 7 may be produced with no regard to the joint non joint operation with an adaptive transversal equalizer and, afterwards, modified to any of the other various configurations shown and described at the time of installation. Since such modifications are very easy, standardization of modulators is enhanced to promote cost effective production. Further, in any of the embodiments shown in Figs. 2A and 2B, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, the phase shifter 38 may be replaced with a phase shifter whose phase shift value is controlled by a voltage signal, and a control circuit for generating the voltage signal may be added. This will also contribute a great deal to the standardization of demodulators. While the present invention has been shown and described in relation to a four phase modulated signal, a sixteen level QAM signal and a sixty four level QAM signal, it is similarly applicable to QAM signals having more than sixty four levels and QAM signals of the kind which provide demodulated signals having multiple irregularly spaced levels, e.g. an eight phase modulated signal. In summary, it will be seen that the present invention provides a demodulator which is usable in combination with an adaptive transversal equalizer to promote quality transmission of a large amount of data despite a limited occupied bandwidth of a carrier passband, while compensating for distortions due to delay and attenuation which are inherent in a transmission path. In addition, the present invention facilitates standardization of demodulators and, thereby, cut down in the cost of demodulators.
