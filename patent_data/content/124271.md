## Abstract
Crystalline galloaluminosilicates having an X ray diffrac tion pattern substantially the same as that of an MFI zeolite and a composition in terms of mole ratios of oxides as follows 0.9 0.2 M A process for the production of the crystalline gallo aluminosilicates which comprises crystallising at elevated temperature a gel comprising i a source of silica SiO₂ , ii a source of alumina Al₂O₃ , iii a source of gallia Ga₂O₃ , iv a mineralising agent selected from oxides, hydroxides and salts of alkali and alkaline earth metals X
