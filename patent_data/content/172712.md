# CONTROLLED FORCE VARIABLE RELUCTANCE ACTUATOR

## Abstract
In a controlled force variable reluctance position sensing actuator having a moving element operated by a solenoid 84 the current in the solenoid 84 is controlled by a signal representative of the flux density in the magnetic circuit of the actuator. The signal is produced by a Hall effect device 83 placed in the magnetic circuit, and the current in the solenoid is controlled by controlling its duty cycle although continuous control of the current may also be employed. The position of the moving element is monitored and selectively controlled in response to measured electric and magnetic parameters of the actuator. Alternative embodiments are provided for a constant force actuator, an actuator whose force displacement characteristic is altered, and an actuator in which the force may be selectively controlled.
