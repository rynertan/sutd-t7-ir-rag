# Mop wringing devices.

## Abstract
A mop wringing device has a main frame 2 with a fixed lower support plate 4 and a displaceable upper pressure plate 14 . A toggle link mechanism 32 38 pivots the pressure plate downwards about a rear edge pivot 24, 26 connection to squeeze water from a mop head placed between the two plates. The mechanism comprises a torque bar 34 mounted below the support plate and C form lever arms 36 secured at one end to the bar and connected at the other end to the pressure plate through toggle links 38 . The arrangement allows a wide opening of the plates and a high wringing pressure on the mop head. The pivot connection of the pressure plate comprises upwardly elongate slots 26 for end pivot pins 24 , whereby the pressure plate can tilt to a limited degree to adapt to the thickness of the mop head.
