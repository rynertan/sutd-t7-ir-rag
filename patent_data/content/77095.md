# Copying machine and a control system for the same.

## Abstract
In a copying machine an original to be copied as well as an image element upon which an image of the original can be formed are conveyed by means of syn chronous motors. A voltage supply for a first one of the synchronous motors delivers a voltage having a first A.C. voltage component. Other A.C. voltage components are synchronously derived therefrom for driving the other synchronous motors in synchronism with the first one. Further a pulse generator circuit is connected to the voltage sup ply to generate control pulses for the copying machine at a frequency proportional to the frequency of the first A.C. voltage component. In a programmable control system the control pulses may be used to interrupt a current programme for priority treatment of an interrupt programme.
