# CONTINUOUS PROCESS FOR NEUTRALIZATION OF ALUMINATE SOLUTION TO FORM GELS AND APPARTATUS THEREFOR

## Abstract
Alumina gel is produced on a continuous basis in a stirred reactor into which is bubbled carbon dioxide to neutralize an aluminate solution feeding into the reactor. Careful control of the process parameters, including pH, residence time, temperature and gas flow rate, as well as the geometry of the reactor and other apparatus parameters, can result in the formation of preselected types of gel. When pseudoboehmite is formed in accordance with the invention, alumina gels can be formed with surface areas as high as 300 to 700 square meters per gram.
