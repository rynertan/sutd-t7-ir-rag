# METHOD OF ENUMERATING SEROLOGICALLY SELECTED CELL POPULATIONS

## Abstract
Methods for enumerating cell populations serologically selected from a heterogenous population by contacting the cells with specific antibodies absorbed onto a solid surface, staining the bound cells with a nucleic acid specific fluores cent stain and appropriately illuminating the cells whereup on bulk fluorescence may be detected and the number of cells calculated therefrom.
