## Description
SPECIFICATIONTitle of the Invention A manufacturing method for a printed wiring substrate and a heater therefor,Technical Field This invention relates to a manufacturing method for a printed wiring substrate and a heater therefor which is available for radio receivers or television receivers, and aims at provision of a manufacturing method for a printed wiring substrate, which reduces a temperature rise at the printed wiring substrate as much as possible to ensure curing of an adhesive in a short time.Background Art Generally, when microelectronic parts are mounted on the printed wiring substrate, a method has widely been used, in which a phenolic resin laminated plate 2 with a copper foil pattern 1 is coated with an adhesive 4 as shown in Fig. 1, microelectronic parts to be hereinafter called the chip parts 5 and 6 are placed on the adhesive 4, the adhesive reacts to be cured by heating or both heating and radiation of ultraviolet rays, and the chip parts 5 and 6 are fixed on a printed wiring substrate 3 and thereafter soldered thereto. In this case, epoxy resin series and acrylic resin series mainly are used as the adhesive, and a curing temperature has to be raised in order to use a small sized conveyor type continuous curing apparatus for reduction of curing time period.On the other hand, copper foil is subjected at s.e the surface easily to oxidization as its temperature rises, thereby causing poor soldering. In some cases, an electronic part 7 with lead wires is previously inserted into insertion bores from the surface of printed wiring substrate 3 carrying no chip part, some electronic parts with lead wires being lower in heat resistance.Hence, it has been preferable to cure the adhesive at a high temperature and in a short time and not to heat the printed wiring substrate and electronic parts with lead wires as much as possible. The conventional adhesive curing method and an apparatus therefor, as shown in Fig. 2, have placed a printed wiring substrate 3 on a conveyor 11 and heated it from above by use of far infrared ray heaters 8 and a heater control temperature sensor 9 are fixed to an outer casing 10 of furnace body, the heater control temperature sensor 9 having usually been disposed in a position where an atmosphere under the far infrared ray heaters 8 and above the printed wiring substrate 3 is measurable. Such conventional adhesive curing method, however, heats the printed wiring substrate 3 and electronic part 7 with lead wires simultaneously with heating the adhesive 4, whereby a heating temperature for the printed wiring substrate is limited to thereby create a problem in that it is difficult to reduce an adhesive curing time period.Disclosure of the Invention This invention aims at the provision of a manufacturing method for a printed wiring substrate, comprising processes of placing microelectronic parts on a printed wiring substrate through an adhesive, blowing cold air onto the surface of printed wiring substrate about simultaneously with heating the same from above by use of infrared ray heaters, and soldering the printed wiring substrate. This invention is particularly advantageous in that the influence of cold air minimizes a temperature rise at the printed wiring substrate and moreover the adhesive is curable in a short time. These and other object of the invention will become more apparent in the detailed description and examples which follow.Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 is a sectional view of a printed wiring panel, Fig. 2 is a sectional view of a heating apparatus for a conventional printed wiring substrate, and Figs. 3 and 4 are sectional views of heating apparatus for embodiments of the invention.Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiment Next, an embodiment of the invention will be detailed.Referring to Fig. 3, an embodiment of a manufacturing method for a printed wiring substrate of the invention is shown, in which a printed wiring substrate 3 carrying chip parts is placed on a conveyor 11 and heated from above by use of far infrared ray heaters to thereby cure an adhesive, a heater control sensor 9 being brought into contact with one far infrared ray heater 8 and fixed thereto. An outer casing 10a for the furnace body is provided with a cold air inlet 12 and an exhaust outlet 13, the cold air inlet 12 being directed at its nozzle toward the exhaust outlet 13 so that cold air after cooling the printed wiring substrate 3 is exhausted, through the exhaust outlet 13 not to flow into a working chamber.The exhaust air from the outlet 13 is desirable to be larger in amount than cold air taken in through the inlet 12, and the nozzle thereof should be positioned in the direction of allowing the cold air to effectively strike the surface of printed wiring substrate 3, the cold air being preferable to be cooled by a cooler, but usual air blast need only be available. The printed wiring substrate 3 is adapted to be placed on the conveyor 11 and move continuously leftwardly in the Figure. In this method, when the adhesive below the microelectronic parts is heated, the infrared rays radiated from the heaters 8 have the permeability to reach not only the surface of printed wiring sub strata but also the adhesive below the microelectronic parts, thereby heating the adhesive also.However, the printed wiring substrate 3, which is cooled by cold air, can be restricted in its temperature rise to a minimum, and the adhesive is not struck directly by the cold air thanks to the existence of microelectronic parts. Therefore, the temperature rise at the printed wiring substrate 3 is minimized and the adhesive can sufficiently be heated, thereby enabling to heat the adhesive by the intense infrared rays in a short time. W f S ot c r Next, explanation will be giventon the curing of adhesive in such a manner that the chip parts 5 are loaded on the upper surface of printed wiring substrate 3 and an electrolytic capacitor 14 is inserted into the lower surface of the same so that the substrate 3 is placed on the conveyor 11 and heated from above by the far infrared ray heaters 8. In this case, the heater control temperature sensor 9 is provided in contact with the surface of one far infrared ray heater 8, and a cold air inlet 12 is provided below the printed wiring substrate 3 to prevent the temperature rise at the electrolytic capacitor inferior in heat resistance.In a case where the surface of printed wiring substrate 3 is kept in a temperature of about 1500C for 30 seconds, the air blast from the inlet could keep the surface temperature of electrolytic capacitor under 1000C, but in a case of no air blast, the temperature of the same rose up to 1300C.Thus, the adhesive on the upper surface of substrate 3 can sufficiently be heated to be cured in a short time because the printed wiring substrate 3 is cooled at the lower surface thereof only. The infrared ray heater for the invention is desirable to have a wavel,ength of 20 through 30 pm, such wavelength being given effectively by keeping the surface temperature of heater at a temperature of 300 to 10000C.The embodiment of the invention provides the heater control sensor in contact with the surface of heater, whereby no temperature drop of sensor occurs by the cold air and the infrared rays can properly be selected by intensity and wavelength thereof. The adhesive in use for the invention need only be of heat curing property so that epoxy resin series, acrylic resin series, and phenolic resin series are available. Alternatively, the cold air inlet and exhaust outlet may be plural in number, or be provided above and below the printed wiring substrate 3. Also, the exhaust outlet is preferable to be one or more, but may be replaced by natural exhaust air through an opening at the outer casing of the furnace body. Also, in a case of using both the heating and ultraviolet ray radiation for curing the adhesive, the cold air blast is possible as the same as aforesaid.Industrial Applicability As seen from the above, this invention is characterized in that the microelectronic parts are placed onto the printed wiring substrate through the adhesive, the infrared ray heaters heat the parts from above the printed wiring substrate, and cold air is blown from above or below the printed wiring substrate onto the surface thereof, thereby minimizing a temperature rise at the printed wiring substrate and electronic parts and the adhesive is cured in a short time. Thus, the invention is improvable of reliability and productivity and very effective in practical use.
