# Spot weldable lightweight composite material.

## Abstract
A lightweight composite material consisting of two metal sheets and an intermediate layer consisting of a mixture of resin and graphite and held between the metal sheets, said intermediate layer having a specifically limited thickness and a specifically limited graphite content, and said graphite having a specifically limited particle size distribu tion, is excellent in the spot weldability, bending rigidity, vibration damping property and heat insulating property, and can be expected to be widely used as a material for automobile and further materials for industrial machine and architecture.
