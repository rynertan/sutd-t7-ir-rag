# Process for the preparation of benzoic acid.

## Abstract
A process for the preparing of a benzene monocarboxylic acid by oxidation of a monoalkyl benzene compound in the liquid phase with the aid of a gas containing molecular oxygen in the presence of a catalyst composed of a cobalt and a manganese compound, both of which are soluble in the reaction mixture, with a manganese cobalt atomic ratio bet ween 1 500 and 1 100,000, thus improving the selectivity of the reaction to form the desired benzene monocarboxylic acid.
