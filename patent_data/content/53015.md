## Description
1 PHENYLTHIO 2 AMINOPROPANE DERIVATIVES, THEIR PRODUCTION AND USE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to novel l phenylthio 2aminopropane derivatives having excellent pharmacological actions. 2. Description of the Prior Art Belgian Patent No. 653,101 referes to 2 phenylthioethylamine derivatives including l phenylthio 2 methylaminopropane as having hypertensive, hypotensive and antiepileptic properties. South African Patent No. 67 3108 describes 1 4 chlorophenylthio 2 aminopropane as having an antidepressive activity. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present inventors have succeeded in synthesizing novel l phenylthio 2 aminopropane derivatives of the formula EMI1.1 wherein R1 is halogen R2 is hydrogen or halogen and R3 is methyl, ethyror hydroxyethyl, and have found that these compounds and acid addition salts thereof have outstanding antiobesity and antidiabetic actions. Thus, the present invention provides the novel 1phenylthio 2 aminopropane derivatives I and acid addition salts thereof, which have excellent pharmacological actions.This invention also provides the use of these compounds as medicaments. This invention further provides industrially feasible processes for producing these compounds. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EWBODIMENTS Referring to the above mentioned formula I , the halogen for R1 and R2 includes fluorine, chlorine and bromine. When R2 is halogen, this halogen and the halogen for R1 may be the same or different. Among the compounds I , preferred embodiments are those wherein R3 is methyl or and R1 is chlorine. A preferable specific embodiment in the present invention is l 4 chlorophenylthio 2 methylaminopropane and its physiologically acceptable salts. The compound I of this invention can be produced, for example, according to the following reaction scheme Process IEMI2.1 Process IIEMI3.1 Process mEMI3.2 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above, R4 is hydrogen 5 or formyl, R is acyl and X is a leaving group. In Step A of Process I the thiophenol derivativeXII is reacted with chloroacetone. The reaction can be conducted in a manner known per se at 0 to 20 C in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol in the presence of an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or the like. The resulting compound CII1 can readily be collected in any purified form by distillation or recrystallization. In Step B , the compound tri and the amine of the formula R3NH2 are subjected to condensation under reductive conditions to synthesize the compound I . This reductive amination is preferably performed particularly by use of lithium or sodium cyanoborohydride LiBH3CN or NaBH3CN and usually carried out using, per mole of the compound E , 2 to 20 moles of R3NH2 in the presence of 1 to 3 moles of an acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or acetic acid in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol. The acid may be added to the reaction system in the form of a salt with R3NH2. It is usually preferred that the amount ofLiBH3CN or NaBH3CN be 0.5 to 2 moles per mole of E and the reaction temperature be in the range of from room temperature to the boiling point of the solvent.In the reductive amination, an imine of the formula EMI4.1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above, is first formed and the imine lEE is then reduced to form the desired compound I . Therefore, it is also possible to first synthesize the imine m from the compound z and R3NH2 and then reduce it. In such cases, NaBH4, LiAlH4 and the like can be used as a reducing agent, in addition to the aforementioned ones. In Step C , the compound foe and a primary amine or its N formyl derivative are reacted in the presence of formic acid. This procedure utilizes the so called Leuckaft reaction which is known per se. The reaction may be performed by heating 1 to 20 moles, preferably 5 to 10 moles of a primary amine or its N formyl derivative and 1 to 10 moles of formic acid together with one mole of the compound foe at 120 to 1800C, preferably at 130 to 1700C in the absence of a solvent. The resulting compound IV is subjected, after purification or directly without purification, to hydrolysis in Step D to synthesize the desired product I . The hydrolysis is preferably carried out by heating with a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid. Step E of Process II is carried out by reacting a compound V with a thiophenol derivative II . The leaving group X of the compound V is preferably a halogen which may be any of chlorine, bromine and iodine. It is generally preferred to perform this reaction in a suitable solvent in the presence of a base. As the base, for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, etc. can be used conveniently.Any solvent which does not interfere with the reaction may be used, and the solvent maybe suitably selected, for example, from methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, dioxane, dimethylformamide and their aqueous solution. While the reaction proceeds at 0 to 300C, it may be carried out under heating to the boiling point in order to accelerate the reaction. While the compounds II and V may be used in equimolar amounts, either may be present in a slight excess. The amount of the base used is 1 to 1.2 moles per mole of the compound II , but when the compound V is used in the form of an acid addition salt e.g., hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide , an additional amount of the base should be added to neutralize the acid.When X is chlorine or bromine which is relatively less reactive, the reaction may be carried out in the presence of 0.1 to 1 mole of sodium iodide or potassium iodide per mole of the compound V in order to accelerate the reaction. Regarding Process m, the acyl for R is preferably one shown by the formula COR51 wherein R5 is lower alkyl, aryl, aralkyl or a group of 5 5 its R is lower alkyl, aryl or aralkyl . The lower alkyl represented by R51 or R511 includes those containing 1 4 carbon atoms, such as methyl , ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, 5 n butyl, sec butyl and tert butyl. The aryl for R or R5 is preferably phenyl, and the aralkyl includes phenyl lower C1 2 alkyl containing 7 to 8 carbon atoms, such as benzyl, phenethyl, and a methylbenzyl.When R51 or R5 contains a benzenering, it may have at an optional position or positions on the benzene ring such substituents as methyl, ethyl, methoxy, chlorine,bromine and nitro. In Step I of Process m, a 2 amino l phenylthiopropane derivative IX is acylated by use of an acid halide or anhydride corresponding to the acyl to obtain the compound VII . It is generally advantageous to conduct this acylation in a suitable solvent in the presence of a base. As the base, use is made of, for example, sodium hydrogencarbonate, potassium hydrogencarbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, triethylamine, pyridine or the like. The solvent may be, for example, chloroform, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or dimethoxyethane.While the reaction proceeds smoothly at 20 to 300C, it may be conducted under appropriate heating for accelerating the reaction. A compound VII wherein R5 is a group of COOR5 .. R is as defined above may be produced also by Step F wherein a thiophenol derivative II is reacted with a compound VI . Preferred examples of the leaving group X of the compound VI include, in addition to those exemplified above in connection with the compound V ,alkylor aryl sulfonyloxy groups such as methanesulfonyloxy, benzenesulfonyloxy and p toluenesulfonyloxy. The reactian between the compounds II and VI can be carried out under the same conditions as in the aforesaid Step E . In the alkylation of a compound VII in Step G , the compound VII is first reacted with a suitable base in an anhydrous solvent to give an anion, which is then reacted with a conventional alkylating agent. The base to be used is suitably selected from sodium hydride, sodium amide, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium tbutoxide and the like, and the solvent includes dimethylformamide, methyl sulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethoxyethane and the like. The alkylating agent may be one employed in the conventional alkylation reactions and includes, for example, halides e.g. chloride, bromide or iodide , sulfate ester e.g. dimethylsulfate, diethylsulfate , sulfonate ester e.g. methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate or toluenesulfonate , etc. of the alkyl corresponding to R3.The reaction is usually carried out at o to 400C, but a lower or higher temperature may be employed in order to control the reaction rate. The resulting compound Vm may be subjected to deacylation to form the corresponding compound I Step H The deacylation can readily be performed by use of an acid e.g. hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid or an alkali e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, barium hydroxide , as well as, when R5 is a group of COOR R is aralkyl or t butyl , by the deprotection reaction which is known per se in peptide chemistry.Thus, these groups may be eliminated by reaction with hydrogen bromide acetic acid, and p methoxybenzyl or t butyl 511 for R may be eliminated by use of trifluoroacetic acid or hydrogen chloride organic solvent or hydrogen chlorideacetic acid. In the deacylation reaction in the case c.where R is aralkyl or t butyl, satisfactory results may be obtained by adding anisole, mercaptoethanol, methyl ethyl sulfide or the like so as to suppress side reactions. The thus formed desired compound I can be isolated in the form of a free base or acid addition salt in a manner which is known per se. For example, a free base can be purified and collected by distillation, and an acid addition salt by recrystallization. The acid addition salt is preferably a physiologically acceptable one which includes, for example, inorganic acid salts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate and phosphate and organic salts such as acetate, maleate, fumarate, acid fumarate, succinate, tartrate, citrate and malate. The compound I includes two optically active isomers wherein the absolute configurations at the carbon asterisked in the formula I are the S and R configurations, respectively. It is a matter of course that the present invention encompasses both of these isomers as well as a mixture thereof. If desired, the individual isomers may be prepared. For example, when the reaction in Process II or m is carried out using an optically active isomer eitherS or R configuration as the starting compound V , VI or IX , the compound I can be obtained as the corresponding optically active isomer.Alternatively, if the product is a mixture of these two isomers, it can be separated into the individual optical isomers and purified by the conventional optical resolution method, for example, by forming a salt with an optically active carboxylic acid e.g., d or Q tartaric acid, d or Q malic acid, dcamphoric acid or an optically active sulfonic acid e.g., d camphorsulfonic acid , separating into the individual salts of the isomers by means of recrystallization, then converting each optically active isomer into the free base I and further converting the free base into an appropriate acid addition salt. Of the thus obtained optically active compounds I , those having the S configuration generally exhibit more favorable physiological actions than the isomers having the R configuration. The compounds I and acid addition salts thereof according to this invention exhibit, in animals, particularly mammals e.g. mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, cats, dogs, monkeys, human beings highly special pharmacological actions such as anorectic action, and suppressive effects on postprandial hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and lipogenesis. Obesity or diabetes accompanying obesity is known to be associated with overeating, an increase in body fat, hyperinsulinemia, a decrease in glucose tolerance, etc. Therefore, the compounds of this invention are effective preventive and therapeutic agents for obesity and diabetes.Also, since the compounds of this invention have a low toxicity and do not have an excitative action on the central nervous system, that is a material side. effect commonly found in anorectic agents, they can be used with safety in therapy over a prolonged period of time. In addition, as they are well absorbed by oral administration and have good stability, they can be administered orally or parenterally with safety either as they are or in a pharmaceutical form such as powders, granules, tablets, capsules, injections, etc. wherein the active compound is mixed with appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients and or diluents, for medicinal uses such as those mentioned above.The dosage depends on species, condition, age and weight of the mammals, the administration route and the like, but when the compound is orally administered to an adult human as the prophylactic and therapeutic agent for obesity or diabetes, for example, a daily dose of about 0.1 to 60 mg kg, particularly about 0.2 to 20 mg kg is preferred and it is desirable to divide such daily dose into several portions so as to take at about every meal time. As compounds similar to the compounds of this invention, Belgian Patent No. 653,101 refers to 2 phenylthioethylamine derivatives of the general formula EMI10.1 wherein R is hydrogen, hydrocarbon optionally substituted, hydroxy, alkoxy or halogen, R1 and R2 each are hydrogen, lower hydrocarbon,straight or branched chain,which with the N can form a heterocycle,and R3 is hydrogen or lower hydrocarbon, and acid addition salts thereof, as having hypertensive, hypotensive and antiepileptic properties.But, this patent specifically described only those compounds in which the benzene ring is unsubstituted such as l phenylthio 2 methylaminopropane X , and nothing is referred to therein with respect to antiobesity or antidiabetic action. South African Patent No. 67 3108 describes the antidepressive activity of l 4 chlorophenylthio 2 aminopropane of the formula EMI10.2 but this patent also says nothing about antiobesity or antidiabetic action. According to the inventors study, the compound X exerts no antiobesity or antidiabetic effect and the compound XI has only a weak transient anorectic effect which is of no practical value. In contrast, the compounds of this invention exert strong and long lasting antiobesity and antidiabetic effects because of their having the particular substituent halogen at the particular para position of the benzene ring and having the particular secondary amine type structure. The starting compounds V and VI in Processes II and m can readily be synthesized from alanine according to the following reaction scheme. For example, an alanine derivative of formula XII is reduced and the resulting aminoalcohol XFE is treated with a halogenating agent to give a starting compound V R3 methyl in V in the form of an acid addition salt, while the compound XII is partially reduced and the resulting compound XIV is then sulfonylated to give a compound VI .EMI11.1 wherein R5 is as defined above, R6 is hydrogen, lower alkyl or benzyl, Y is halogen, Z is an alkyl or arylsulfonyloxy. The reduction of a compound XII to synthesize the compound Xm proceeds advantageously by use of lithium aluminum hydride and is usually carried out in a solvent such as ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane or the like, at a temperature in the range of from room temperature to the boiling point of the solvent. The halogenating agents which are used in halogenation of the resulting compound Xm include hydrobromic acid, thionyl chloride, phosphorus tribromide, etc. In the case where hydrobromic acid is used, its aqueous solution is used as it is. When thionyl chloride, phosphorus tribromide or the like is used, an anhydrous inert solvent, for example, chloroform, dichloromethane, benzene, toluene or the like may be used. Other N alkylalaninols may also be synthesized by reduction of an N alkylalanine or its ester which is prepared in the manner described in Canadian Journal ofChemistry, Vol. 49, page 1968 1971 or Vol. 51, page 1915 1973 , or in a similar manner, or by reduction of an Nacylalanine or its ester. Lithium aluminum hydride can be advantageously used also in these reduction reactions. In the partial reduction of an alanine derivative XII to synthesize a compound XIV , the reducing agent used is preferably sodium borohydride when the compound XE is an ester and diborane when XII is a free carboxylic acid. The reduction with sodium borohydride advantageously proceeds in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol at a temperature in the range of from room temperature to the boiling point of the solvent, while the reduction with diborane advantageously proceeds in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethoxyethane or diglyme at a temperature of 0 to 400C to obtain the desired compound XIV . It is also possible to halogenate an alaninol XV which is a reduction product of alanine in the same way as in the reduction of XIE to form a compound XVI , which is then acylated to give a compound VI as shown in the following reaction scheme and the thus obtained compound VI can also be used as a starting material in the present inventionEMI13.1 wherein R5 and Y are as defined above. Another starting compound IX for Process m can be synthesized in the manner described in South AfricanPatent No. 67 3108 or in a manner similar thereto, or by reacting the thiophenol derivative II with the compound XVI in the presence of a base e.g. sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide in an alcohol e.g. methanol or ethanol at from room temperature to the boiling point of the alcohol used. In each case, the use of L alanine or L alaninol leads to the formation of the starting compound V , VIt , VI or IX having the S absolute configuration, and the use of D alanine or D alaninol to the formation of those having the R absolute configuration, while the use of DL alanine or DL alaninol results in the formation of optically inactive compound V , VI , VI or IX . The following pharmacological experiments demonstrate the excellent utility of compounds I according to this invention.A.
