# Apparatus for testing sedimentation rates of liquids.

## Abstract
The apparatus consists of at least one test tube carrier 11,13 defining seats 15,17 for test tubes 1 . The carriers 11,13 are moved by oscillation or rotary motion about a horizontal axis under the influence of time control means, A structure 35 which is vertically movable relative to the test tubes 1 is fitted with individual means 31,33 for the photometric observation of the data relating to each test tubes 1 and is controlled by time control means. Processing and recording means collect data relating to the presence of each test tube 1 , of the presence of a sample, and the level of said sample, for each test tube seat 15,17 .
