# Method for calibrating analytical moisture measuring equipment.

## Abstract
The water of crystallization of a ceramic material, kaoli nite, is used as a standard for calibrating equipment used for measuring the amount of hydrogen in a nuclear fuel pellet. A kaolinite is heated to a temperature sufficient to drive out the water of crystallization in the kaolinite which is a precisely known amount and the amount is measured. Comparison of to the equipment readout with the known values determines the accuracy of equipment calibration. A nuclear fuel pellet is placed in the equipment and exposed to a temperature suff cent to drive off moisture therein after the equipment has been accurately calibrated. The hydrogen content is then measured to provide an accurate indication of total hydrogen content in the pellet.

## Description
METHOD FOR CALIBRATING ANALYTICAL MOISTURE MEASURING EQUIPMENT The invention described herein relates to a method of calibrating analytical hydrogen measuring apparatus for measuring small amounts of water. A conventional nuclear reactor fuel rod of the type used in commercial nuclear reactors comprises a long narrow tube of zircaloy having multiple fuel pellets sealed therein. When the fuel rod is irradiated during operation of the reactor, hydrogen and other gases are released as a by product of the fission process, but these gases are contained in the sealed rod and do not escape to the surrounding uperheated water which ultimately is used to generate steam for power generating purposes. It has been found that excessive hydrogen in the fuel pellets appearing mostly as moisture, causes hydriding of the zircaloy fuel rod when the hydrogen is released from the fuel pellet during operation of the reactor. The resulting corrosive effects of the hydriding may cause a breach in the fuel rod material and result in radioactive particles leaking into the water circulating through the reactor. To overcome this disadvantage, the upper limit set on permissible moisture content in a pellets or more appropriately, the total moisture equivalent of hydrogen in all forms, was set at 10.5 ppm or less for an average of a region of fuel. In the past, the LECO Corporation,St. Joseph Michigan, commercial hydrogen determinator,Model RH1E, was used for measuring hydrogen alone while aCEC Consolidated Electrodynamics Corporation moisture determinator was used for measuring moisture in the moisture content of fuel pellets. The LECO determinator operating temperature is sufficiently high to dissociate water and is therefore capable of measuring the hydrogen content in moisture. However, there is no known method of accurately determining whether the determinator is always operating accurately.The degree of precision needed in measuring finite amounts of hydrogen, both alone and from the water molecule, dictates that a single, high temperature moisture standard be utilized to measure total hydrogen, including moisture, on a LECO hydrogen or other analyzer. It is therefore the principal object of the present invention to provide a standard for the measurement of small amounts of water which can be used to not only qualify the measuring apparatus but also to keep it in a high state of calibration. With this object in view the present invention resides in a method of determining the hydrogen content of nuclear fuel pellets wherein a nuclear fuel pellet whose hydrogen content is to be measured is placed into a hydrogen measuring apparatus in which said pellet is exposed to a temperature sufficient to assure the extraction of moisture from said pellet, and the content of hydrogen in the moisture extracted from said pellet is measured and a readout thereof is provided on said apparatus, characterized in that before the water content of said fuel pellet is measured a compound having a water of cryallization of a known amount is surface dried and sealed in said apparatus and is then heated to the temperature at which the water of crystallizationis driven from the compound, the quantity of hydrogen in the moisture driven from the compound is measured and compared with the quantity of hydrogen known to be in the water of crystallization of said compound and the apparatus is then precisely adjusted so as to provide an accurate reading for the following measuring of the water content of the fuel pellet. Briefly stated, the above disadvantages of the prior art are eliminated by utilizing the water of crystallization in a ceramic material as a reference for qualifying and calibrating apparatus used to measure total hydrogen content in a nuclear fuel pellet. The water of crystallization in the ceramic which amounts to less than one milligram of water is known and, upon exposure to a high temperature in a confined area, the hydrogen in the moisture can be precisely measured for assuring accuracy in the measuring apparatus. After the accuracy in the apparatus is established, the hydrogen content in nuclear fuel pellets can be precisely measured and thus provide a determination of their acceptability. The invention will become more readily apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof shown, by way of example only, in the accompanying drawing wherein The single figure is a graph showing the percent water in 18 samples of kaolinite and are compared statistically to the theoretical value of water known to be in kaolinite. To accurately calibrate an analyzer used for determining hydrogen content in moisture, water itself is unacceptable as a standard because of the uncertainty involved in determining how much water is in fact delivered by equipment used to furnish sample water for reference purposes. The amount of moisture furnished must be previously known in order to ascertain whether the hydrogen detector or determinator is accurately calibrate. Typically, the small amount of moisture expected in a nuclear fuel pellet, which is less than one milligram of water, suggests a standard providing similar amounts of water.Since this amount of moisture is so small, delivery of the water in an appropriately sized container to apparatus used for analyzing the water content, without losing any of the water by evaporation, presents great logistics and control problems. Nevertheless, as the water of crystallization is used as a standard or reference the substance containing the water of crystallization must meet the following requirements a It must not contain or have on its surface, any hydrogen other than that contained in the water of crystallization b The water of crystallization must be capable of being extracted only at high temperatures to make certain that the substance will be dried of all surface moisture before measuring the hydrogen in the water of crystallization c The substance containing the water of crystallization desirably must be in a form which will permit efficient and quick measurement of hydrogen and d It must be non toxic, both at ambient and elevated temperatures at which the water of crystalliza tion is drawn off from the substance. An exploration of substances, compounds and materials capable of satisfying the above requirements showed that many materials contained water of crystallization which could be extracted at elevated temperatures without destroying the material. The most desired substance found was kaolinite, A12O3 SiO2 .2H2O, which is a solid ceramic material having a small ratio of water to compound weight so that a relatively small amount of water could be delivered to the test apparatus without weighing out an unreasonably small quantity of the compound. The kaolinite contains 13.745 .008 water by weight when dried of surface moisture. All the hydrogen in kaolinite is contained in the water of crystallizationoand as a solid, it will have no evaporation losses. The water of crystallization can be dissociated and expelled or extracted from the kaolinite at a high temperature, i.e., above 9000C. This temperature is below the operating temperature of the LECO apparatus used for determining the amount of hydrogen in the water, but still sufficiently high to allow a sample of kaolinite to be dried of surface moisture without driving off the water of crystallization.Kaolinite is non toxic, thus permitting its unrestricted use without the need to implement safeguard procedures to protect operating personnel. When raised to a temperature above 1000 C, the water of crystallization is drivt n oft and the kaolinite changes its crystalline structure to become another non toxic ceramic material, i.e, mullite. To make certain that the LECO apparatus could accurately measure total water content of a standard with no significant difference from the theoretical, assuming an error risk of 5 , tests were conducted on two sets of ten kaolinite samples of various weights. These samples were dried in small amounts enclosed in pre weighed tin capsules and were run on different days. The difference in gross and tare weights of a tin capsule gave the weight of the kaolinite inside and multiplying this weight by 13.745 gave the weight of water that would be extracted.The results in the Figure, LECO Measurement of Fraction H O of Kaolinite , shows that two samples of the second 2 set were eliminated because of experimental error. A correction for the moisture background of the tin capsules was calculated and used in analysis of the data. According to usual procedures, the eighteen LECO measurements were treated as eighteen determinations of a standard, namely the percent H2O in kaolinite, and were compared statistically to the theoretical value, 13.745 H2O. The data shown in Figure 1 is graphed as DVM Theoretical versus DVM Measured in order to show the linearity of the data and to disclose any outliers or samples beyond the test range. The results of the eighteen kaolinite standards shown on the graph include zbVM units which represent the output of the LECO and which can be converted into PPM H2O when multiplied by 63 and divided by sample weight. The ordinate represents the DVM units expected from the water in each kaolinite standard. The abscissa represents the actual DVM reading for each standard.Each LECO DVM was also converted to percent H2O and the average of the eighteen samples was found not to be significantly different, at a 95 confidence level, from the theoretical. In view of both the chemical and physical characteristics of kaolinite, taken together with the ease of making and using samples thereof, it is apparent that it represents an excellent standard for PPM water and for determining the accurate calibration of the hydrogen measuring apparatus. Having thus determined that the LECO hydrogen determinator accurately and precisely measures hydrogen alone and or the hydrogen content in moisture, it also can serve as a means for showing that the LECO apparatus is properly calibrated. As indicated above, the percentage water of crystallization in kaolinite is known and by using a relatively small amount of kaolinite, e.g., about .0007 grams, the water of crystallization can be extracted and the hydrogen content in the moisture accurately determined. To determine the hydrogen content in a nuclear fuel pellet, having dimensions of about .366 inch diameter x .600 inch length, the pellet is dried of moisture and placed in the LECO apparatus and exposed to heat at about 20000C. At these temperatures, the pellet characteristics are such that it fragments as a result of internal pressures and stresses and all of the moisture contained in the pellet is driven off and thus made available to theLECO hydrogen sensors. The hydrogen content in the moisture is thereupon measured and a digital readout on the apparatus visually displays the hydrogen content in the pellet. Although kaolinite is an example of a product having a water of crystallization which can only driven off at a high temperature, and which is used as a standard, it will be apparent that other products or compounds having similar characteristics may perform the function of a standard. One example of such compounds is potassium pyrophosphate which has a water of crystallization of l.l . However, it loses its water content at 3000C but nevertheless may be used as a standard. Terbium sulfate is another compound useful as a standard. It contains 19 water of crystallization and loses it at about 3600C.
