# Apparatus and method for signal processing.

## Abstract
An n dimensional channel code is used in a data transmission system. The alphabet of codewords data symbols comprises a subset of points of a selected coset of a selected lattice. The alphabet includes at least one point of the coset whose norm signal energy is greater than at least one other point of the coset which is excluded from the alphabet.
