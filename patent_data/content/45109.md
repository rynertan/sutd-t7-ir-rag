# Set of electrodes for an apparatus for electrically stunning slaughter cattle.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a set of two electrodes for an apparatus for electrically stunning slaughter cattle, said electrodes extending downwardly and for wardly into the V shaped passage between two endless conveyors, which electrodes 1 according to the in vention have rounded lower edges 4 which smoothly merge into converging inner edges 5 which through a reverse bending 6 merge into a straight portion 7 said electrodes being preferably made from a flat plate shaped such that its angle with respect to a reference plane 9 from top to bottom increases and decreases whilst its distance to a reference plane 9 for the outer edge 3 remains equal in the first one third part of the length then decreases slightly, increases in the center range and decreases again such that said two electro des can engage the animals head like to tumb free finger closed hands.
