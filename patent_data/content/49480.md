# Scroll type fluid compressor unit.

## Abstract
In a scroll type fluid compressor having an orbiting scroll member 14 and a fixed scroll member which forms at least one pair of outer fluid pockets and a center pocket therebe tween for fluid compression, the axial end surfaces of each spiral element of the scroll members have a groove 21 along the spiral curve. At least one closed portion 211 is located along the groove 21 to block fluid flow in the groove. A seal element 22 is loosely fitted in the groove 21 . During operation the compressed fluid flows into the groove 21 to urge the seal element 22 against the end plate 142, 132 of the opposite scroll member 14, 13 so that the axial sealing between the spiral element and the end plate is assured without leakage of fluid along the groove. Also, the closed portion 211 is located along the spiral element at the location where the line contact point where the outer fluid pockets and the central pockets merge to prevent back pressure changes from causing excessive wear of the seal element 22 .
