# Improved backgauge structure.

## Abstract
An improved backgauge structure for a metal working machine 10 as, for example, a press brake 13 with improved rotatable gauging fingers 88 89 that can be rotated 90 and pulled out for replacement but which will not fall out and which are spring loaded so that the gauging fingers 88 89 can pivot upwardly in response to movement of the material and further including a pivoted channel member 76 to which the gauging fingers 88 89 are attached so as to provide improved gauging means.
