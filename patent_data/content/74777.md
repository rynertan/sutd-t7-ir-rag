## Description
ANTIBACTERIAL 6 2 AMINO 2 4 ACYLOXY PHENYL ACETAMIDO PENICILLANOYLOXYMETHYL ESTERS This invention relates to new chemical compounds which are of value as antibacterial agents. More particularly it relates to certain new bis esters of methanediol, in which one hydroxy group of the methanediol has been esterified with the carboxy group of a 6 2 amino 2 4 acyloxyphenylZacetamido penicillanic acid compound and the other hydroxy group has been esterified with the carboxy group of a beta lactamase inhibitor. Said latter beta lactamase inhibitor is one of the type which contains a beta lactam ring as well as a carboxy group. United States patent No. 4,244,951, Belgian patentNo. 887,L73 and published British patent applicationNo. 2,044,255 disclose a variety of bis esters of methanediol of the formulaEMI1.1 and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein R1 represents certain acyl groups and the radical W CC o o represents a radical of a betalactamase inhibitor, W Ct O OH , which contains a beta lactam ring as well as a carboxy group, said compounds of formula I being useful as antibacterial agents.In particular, RÚ can represent a 2 amino 2 t4 hydroxyphenyl acetyl group. however, it has now been found that compounds of the formula I, wherein the group RÚ represents certain 2 amino 3 4 acyloxyphenyl acetyl groups, constitute a new genus of bis esters of methanediol, having outstanding value in the treatement of bacterial infections in mammals.Additionally, compounds of formula I, in which R1 represents certain 2 protcted amino 2 4 acyloxy phenyl acetyl groups, are useful as intermediates to the antibacterial agents of this invention. The antibacterial agents of the present invention are efficiently absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of mammals, and after absorption they are transformed into 6 2 amino 4 hydroxyphenyl acetamido penicillanic acid amoxicillin and a betalactamase inhibitor. 6 2 amino 2 4 hydroxyphenyl acetamido penicillanic acid and 6 2 amio 2 4 acyloxyphenyl acetamido penicillanic acids are known see further United States patents Nos. 2,985,648, 3,520,876 and 4,053,360.Penicillanic acid 1,1 dioxide is known from United States patent No. 4,234,579. In its broadest sense, this invention provides new antibacterial agents of the formulaEMI3.1 the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof and the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts thereof wherein R2 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl having from one to six carbons, alkoxy having from one to six carbons, HOOC CH2 n , HOFOC C CH3 2 3 carboxycyclopentyl, carboxycyclohexyl, R8R9N and a group of the formulaEMI3.2 wherein n is an integer from 0 to 6 R8 and R9 are each selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl having from one to six carbons, penyl and phenyl substituted with fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo, alkyl having from one to four carbons or alkoxy having from one to four carbons, provided that R8 and R9 ae not both hydrogen and R3 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl having one to four carbons, alkoxy having one to four carbons, fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo and cyano and the radical WÚ C O O represents a radical of a beta lactamase inhibitor, WÚ C O OH, which contains a beta lactam ring as well as a carboxy group. Typical examples of the beta lactamase inhibitor radicals, W1 CY OY O , areEMI4.1 wherein R4 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and hydroxymethyl 5. R is selected from the group consisting of chloro, bromo and iodo R6 is selected from the group consisting of CH2 Cl, CH2 O CO CH3 and C O OR11, wherein R11 is alkyl having from one to four carbons and R10 is selected from the group consisting of hydroxy and those radicals known to impart beta lactamase inhibiting activity to clavulanic acid when attached to the corresponding position in clavulanic acid. However, the preferred antibacterial agents of this invention are the compounds of formula II, whereinWÚ C O O is of formula III and R4 is hydrogen. Within this preferred group, especially preferred compounds are those wherein R is said alkyl. An especially preferred individual compound of the invention is the compound of formula II, wherein WÚ C O O of formula III and R4 is hydrogen, and Rê is propyl. This invention also provides compounds of the formulaEMI5.1 wherein WÚ C O O is as defined previously, R is the group R2 but with any free carboxy group therein proteced and X represents certain amino protecting groups. Said compounds of formula VI I are useful as intermediates to said compounds of formula II. In the compounds of formula VII when WÚ C O O is the formula III, wherein R4 is hydrogen, groups which are lsed for X are l methyl 2 alkoxycarbonylvinyl groups, benzyloxycarbonyl and 4 nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl.Especially preferred is l methyl 2 methoxycarbonylvinyl. This invention relates to derivatives of penicillanic acid, which is represented by the following structural formulaEMI6.1 In formula VIII, broken line attachment of a substituent to the bicyclic nucleus indicates that the substituent is below the plane of the bicyclic nucleus, and such a substituent is said to be in the alpha configuration.Conversely, solid line attachment of a substituent to the bicyclic nucleus indicates that the substituent is attached above the plane of the nucleus, and this latter configuration is referred to as the betaconfiguration. Additionally, wavy line attachment of a substituent to the bicyclic nucleus indicates that the substituent is in the alpha configuration or the bea configuration or that a mixture is present. Thus, for example, using this system, the compounds of formulae II and VII, wherein W1 C O O is of the formulaIII and R4 is hydrogen, are named as derivatives of penicillanoyloxymethylpenicillanate IX , in which primed and unprimed locants are used to distinguish between the two ring systems, viz EMI7.1 Additionally, throughout this specification, whenever reference is made to a compound which has a 2 amino 2 substituted acetamido or 2 substituted amino 2 substituted acetamido group at the 6position of a penicillanic acid derivative, it is to be understood that this refers to a compound in which said 2 amino 2 substituted acetamido or 2 substituted amino 2 substituted acetamido has theD configuration. The compounds of formula II, wherein R2 is as defined previously, and W1 C O O is either of the formula III 4 wherein R is hydrogen, the formula IV or the formula V, can be prepared as follows. The phenolic hydroxy group in the appropriate compound of the formulaEMI8.1 wherein X is an amino protecting group, is acylated with either i an activated derivative of a carboxylic acid of the formula R7 C O OH, wherein R7 is the groupRê, other than R8R9N , and with free carboxy groups therein protected ii a carbamoyl chloride of the formula R8R9N C O Cl, provided that neither R8 nor R9 is hydrogen or iii an isocyanate of the formulaR8 N C O, to give the corresponding compound of the formulaEMI8.2 wherein R7 is R7 of R8R9N and W1 C O O is as defined previously.This acylation is followed by removal of the protecting group X, and, if necessary, removal of any protecting group in R . A variety of protecting groups can be used for the croupX. However, the group X must be compatible with the groupWÚ C O O . The group X must be removable using conditions which do not adversely affect the group W C O O . Thus when W1 C O O is of formula III, where R4 is hydrogen, convenient groups for X are l methyl 2 alkoxycarbonylvinyl groups having 1 to 3 carbons in said alkoxy moiety, the benzyloxycarbonyl group and the 4 nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl group. 1 Methyl 2 methoxy carboxyvinyl C CH3 CH COOCH3 is particularly preferred. The acylation of a compound of formula X can be caried out by reacting said compound of formula X with an acid chloride of the formula R7 CO Cl, an acid anhydride of the formula R7 CO 20, said carbamoyl chloride of the formula R8R9N C O Cl or said isocyanate of the formula R8 N C O. The acylation reaction is usually conducted in a reaction inert solvent system.In a typical procedure, from 0.5 to 2.0 molar equivalents, and preferably about 1 molar equivalent, of the 7 acylating agent of formula R7 CO C1, CO 20, R8R9N C O Cl or R8 N C O, is contacted with said compound of formula X, in a reaction inert solvent, in the presence of a tertiary amine, at a temperature in the range from 10 to 300C.Reaction inert solvents which can be used in this acylation are chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as chloroform and dichloromethane ethers, such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran low molecular weight esters, such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate low molecular weight aliphatic ketones, such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone tertiary amides, such as N,N dimethylformamide end N methyl pyrrolidone acetonitrile and mixtures thereof The tertiary amine is normally used in an amount equivalent to the compound of formula Rê CO Cl, Rê CO 2O,R8R9N C O Cl or R8 N C O, and typical tertiary amines which can be used are triethylamine, tributylamine, dilsopropylethylamine, pyridine and 4 dimethylamino pyridine The compounds of formula VII can be isolated by conventional means, such as removal of the solvent by evaporation. They can be purified, if desired, by conventional methods such as recrystallization or chromatography alternatively, the protecting groupX can be removed from the crude acylation product. The protecting group X is removed from a compound of formula VII by a conventional method for that particular protecting group, but due regard must be given to the lability of the beta lactam rings and the methylenedioxy linkage. The l methyl 2 alkoxycarbonylvinyl groups can be removed simply by exposing the compound of formula VII to an aqueous or partially aqueous solvent system at an acidic pH, i.e. a pH from 0.5 to 3. This is conveniently achieved by treating the acylation product with water and one molar equivalent of a strong acid, at room temperature, optionally in the presence of a co solvent.Typical examples of strong acids which can be used are hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, perchloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and sulfonic acids, such as methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acids and naphthalenesulfonic acids. A variety of co solvents can be used, the major requirements of such a solvent being that it is at least partially miscible with water and it does not adversely affect either the starting material or the product. Typical co solvents are low molecular weight ketones, such as acetone and low molecular weight ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran and l,2 dimethoxyethane. The reaction is usually complete within an hour, and the product is isolated by conventional methods.In many instances, it is sufficient simply to remove the co solvent by evaporation in vacuo, remove the alkyl acetoacetate by extractionFwith a water immiscible solvent such as diethyl ether, and then lyophilize the remaining aqueous solution. This affords the requisite compound of formula II as a salt corresponding to the acid which has been added initially. The benzyloxycarbonyl and 4 nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl groups can be removed from a compound of formula VII by catalytic hydrogenolysis. In this case, a compound of formula VII, wherein X is benzyloxycarbonyl or 4 nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, is stirred or shaken under an atmosphere of hydrogen, or hydrogen mixed with an inert diluent such as nitrogen or argon, in the presence of a catalytic amount of a hydrogenolysis catalyst. Convenient solvents for this hydrogenolysis are lower alkanols, such as methanol and isopropanol ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxan low molecular weight esters, such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane and chloroform water and mixtures of these solvents. However, it is usual to choose conditions under which the starting material is soluble. The hydro genolysis is usually carried out at a temperature in the range from 0 to 600C. and at a pressure in the range from 20 to 100 psig, preferably about 50 psig. The catalysts used in this hydrogenolysis reaction are the type of agents known in the art for this kind of transformation, and typical examples are the noble metals, such as nickel, palladium, platinum and rhodium. It is often convenient to suspend the catalyst on an inert support a particularly convenient catalyst is palladium suspended on an inert support such as carbon, e.g. 10 palladium on carbon. When 10 palladium on carbon is used, it is usually used in a weight amount that is 0.5 to 5.0, and preferably about 1 3, times the weight of the compound of formula VII. As indicated hereinbefore, when it is desired to preapare a compound of formula II in which the group Rê possesses a carboxy group, e.g. Rê is HOOC CH2 , it is advantageous to protect said carboxy group during the acylation of the compound of formula X. Convenient groups for achieving this carboxy protection are the benzyi group and the 4 nitrobenzyl group. Accordingly, when it is desired to prepare a compound of formula II in which R2 possesses a carboxy group, it is necessary to remove the carboxy protecting group from the compound of formula VII as well as the protecting group X.As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, whenX is benzyloxycarbonyl or 4 nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, and it is removed by catalytic hydrogenolysis as described previously, the benzyl or 4 nitrobenzyl carboxy protecting groups are removed concomitantly.However, if a non hydrogenolytic method is used to remove the protecting group X, the benzyl or 4 nitrobenzyl protecting groups must be removed in a separate step. In this case they are conveniently removed by hydrogenolysis, using the method described for removal of X as benzyloxycarbonyl or 4 nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl. The oamoszds of formula II, wherein R2 is as defined previously, and WÚ C O O is formula III wherein R4 is hydroxymethyl, or of formula VI, can be prepared as follows. Firstly, the compound of the formulaEMI13.1 is acylated with an activated derivative of a carboxylic acid of the formula R7 C O OH, a carbamoyl chloride of the formula R R N C O C1 or an isocyanate of the formula R8N C O, wherein M is a carboxylate salt forming cation, X is an amino protecting group of the type mentioned earlier and R7, R8 and R9 are as defined previously, to give a compound of the formulaEMI14.1 wherein R7t is R7 or R8R9N . This acylation is carried out in the same manner as described earlier for the acylation of a compound of the formula X with an activated derivative of a car boxylic acid of the formula R7 C O OH, a carbamoyl chloride of the formula R8R9N C O Cl or an isocyanate of the formula R8N C O. Examples for M are sodium, potassium and tetra n butylammonium. Secondly, the compound of the formula XII is converted into an ester of the formulaEMI14.2 wherein Z is a good leaving group, e.g. chloro, bromo or iodo. This is carried out in conventional fashion for this kind of transformation. See, for example,U.S. patents Nos. 3,850,908 and 4,244,951, publishedBritish patent application No. 2,044,255, publishedDutch patent application No 81 00209 and Belgian patent No. . 887,173. Thirdly, the compound of formula XIII is coupled with the appropriate compound of the formula W1 C O OM, wherein w1 C O O and M are as previously indicated. This affords a compound of the formula VII, which is then converted into a compound of formula II by removal of the amino protecting group X, and, if necessar,any carboxy protecting group in R7 , by the methods previously described. The compounds of the formula II will form acid addition salts, and these acid addition salts are considered to be within the scope and purview of this invention. Said acid addition salts are prepared by standard methods for penicillin compounds, for example by combining a solution of the compound of formula II in a suitable solvent e.g. water, ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol, ethanol or butanol with a solution containing a stoichiometric equivalent of the appropriate acid. If the salt precipitates, it is recovered by filtration. Alternatively, it can be recovered by evaporation of the solvent, or, in the case of aqueous solutions, by lyophilization.Of particular value are the sulfate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, nitrate, phosphate, citrate, tartrate, pamoate, perchlorate, sulfosalicylate, benzenesulfonate, 4 toluenesulfonate and 2 naphthalenesulfonate salts. Those compounds of the formula II which have a carboxy group in the group R2 will form base salts, and these base salts are considered to be within the scope and purview of this invention. These salts can be prepared by standard techniques, such as contacting the acidic and basic components, usually in a stoichiometric ratio, in an aqueous, non aqueous or partially aqueous medium, as appropriate. They are then recovered by filtration, by precipitation with a non solvent followed by filtration, by evaporation of the solvent, or in the case of aqueous solutions, by lyophilization, as appropriate.Basic agents which are suitably employed in salt formation belong to both the organic and inorganic types, and they include ammonia, organic amines, alkali metal hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates, hydrides and alkoxides, as well as alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates, hydrides and alkoxides.Representative examples of such bases are primary amines, such as n propylamine, n butylamine, aniline, cyclohexylamine, benzylamine and octylamine secondary amines, such as diethylamine, morpholine, pyrrolidine and piperidine tertiary mines, such as triethylamine, N ethylpiperidine, N metbylmorpholine and 1, 5 diazabicyclo 4.3. 0 non 5 ene hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide and barium hydroxide alkoxides, such as sodium ethoxide and potassium ethoxide hydrides, such as calcium hydride and sodium hydride carbonates, such as potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate bicarbonates, such as sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate and alkali metal salts of long chain fatty acids, such as sodium 2 ethylhexanoate. MMen contemplating therapeutic use for a salt of an antibacterial compound of this invention, it is necessary to use a pharmaceutically acceptable salt however, salts other than these can be used for a variety of purposes. Such purposes include isolating and purifying particular compounds, and interconverting pharmaceutically acceptable salts and their non salt counterparts. The compounds of the formula II, and the salts thereof, can be purified by conventional methods for penicillin compounds, e.g. recrystallization or chromatography, but due regard must be given to the lability of the beta lactam ring systems and the methylenedioxy linkage. Those compounds of formula X which are known are prepared by the known method, and those compounds of formula X which are analogs of known compounds are prepared by methods which are analogous to the known methods. In general, a compound of the formula X is prepared by reaction of a compound of the formulaEMI17.1 wherein X is an amino protecting group and is a carboxylate salt forming cation, with the appropriate compound of the formula W1 C O O CH2 Z, wherein Z is a good leaving group, e.g. chloro, bromo or iodo.Examples of 14 are sodium, potassium and tetra n butylammonium. See further, United States patentNo. 4,244,951, published British patent applicationNo. 2,044,255, published Dutch patent applicationNo. 81 00209 and Belgian patent No. 887,173. Methods for the preparation of the compounds of the formula XI are taught in United States patentsNos. 4,244,951 and 3,325,479. Some of the compounds of the formula h C O O CH2 Z are known compounds and the remainder are analogs of known compounds. Those compounds which are known are prepared by the published procedures, and those compounds which are analogs of known compounds are prepared by methods analogous to the published procedures. In general a salt of the corresponding free acid, WÚ C O OH, is reacted with a compound of the formula Z CH2 ZÚ, wherein ZÚ is a leving group and it is the same as, or a better leaving group than,Z. See further, for example, United States patentNo. 4,244,951, published British patent applicationNo. 2,044,255, published Dutch patent applicationNo. 81 00209 and Belgian patent No. 887,173. For the preparation of the compounds of the formula W1 Ct O OH and their salts, see for example,United States patents Nos. ,234,579, 4,287,181, 4,256,733 and ,110,165 published Dutch patent applicatior No. 81 00209 Belgian patent No. 887,173 and published European patent application No. 13,517. The compounds of formula II possess in vivo antibacterial activity in mammals, and this activity can be demonstrated by standard techniques for penicillin compounds. For example, the compound of formula II is administered to mice in which acute infections have been established by intraperitoneal inoculation with a standardized culture of a pathogenic bacterium Infection severity is standardized such that the mice receive one to ten times theLD100 LD1 00 the minimum inoculation required to consistently kill 100 percent of control mice . At the end of the test, the activity of the compound is assessed by counting the number of survivors which have been challenged by the bacterium and also have received the compound of formula II.The compounds of formula II can be administered by both the oral p.o. and subcutaneous Cs c l route. The in vivo activity of the antibacterial compounds of this invention makes them suitable for the control of bacterial infections in mammals, including man, by both the oral and parenteral modes of administration. The compounds are useful in the control of infections caused by susceptible bacteria in human subjects. A compound of formula II breaks down to 6 2 amino 2 f4 hydroxyphenyl acetamido penicillanic acid amoxicillin and a compound of formula W1 C O OH, e.g. penicillanic acid l,l dioxide sulbactam , after administration to a mammalian subject by both the oral and parenteral route. The compound of formula W1 C O OH then functions as a beta lactamase inhibitor, and it increases the antibacterial effectiveness of the amoxicillin. Thus the compounds of the formula II will find usein the control of bacteria which are susceptible to a 1 1 mixture of amoxicillin and a compound of formula W1 C O OH, e.g. susceptible strains ofEscherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. In determining whether a particular strain ofEscherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus is sensitive to a particular compound of formula II, the in vivo test described earlier can be used. Alternatively, the minimum inhibitory concentration MIC of a 1 1 mixture of amoxicillin and a compound of formula W1 C O OH can be measured. The MIC s can be measured by the procedure recommended by the International Collaborative Study on Antibiotic Sensitivity Testing Ericcson and Sherris, Acta. Pathologica et Microbiologia Scandinav, Supp. 217, Section B 64 68 11971 , which employs brain heart infusion HI agar and the inocula replicating device. Overnight growth tubes are diluted 100 fold for use as the standard inoculum 20,000 10,000 cells in approximately 0.002 ml. are placed on the agar surface 20 ml.of BHI agar dishl. Twelve 2 fold dilutions of the test compound are employed, with initial concentration of the test drug being 200 mcg. ml. Single colonies are disregarded when reading plates after 18 hrs. at 370C. The susceptibility 0tIC of the test organism is accepted as the lowest concentration of compound capable of producing complete inhibition of growth as judged by the naked eye. When using an antibacterial compound of this invention, or a salt thereof, in a m2 m21, particularly man, the compound can be administered alone, or it can be mixed witch other antibiotic substances and or pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents. Said carrier or diluent is chosen on the basis of the intended mode of administration.For example, when considering the oral mode of administration, an antibacterial compound of this invention can be used in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, powders, syrups, elixirs, aqueous solutions and suspensions, and the like, in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice. The proportion21 ratio of active ingredient to carrier will naturally depend on the chemical nature, solubility and stability of the active ingredient, as well as the dosage contemplated. In the case of tablets for or21 use, carriers which are commonly used include lactose, sodium citrate and salts of phosphoric acid. Various disintegrants such as starch, and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc, are commonly used in tablets. For oral administration in capsule form, useful diluents are lactose and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols, e.g. polyethylene glycols having molecular weights of from 2000 to 4000. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and or flavoring agents can be added.For parenteral administration, which includes intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, and intravenous use, sterile solutions of the active ingredient are usually prepared, and the pH of the solutions are suitably adjusted and buffered. For intravenous use, the total concentration of solutes should be controlled to render the preparation isotonic. As indicated earlier, the antibacterial compounds of this invention are of use in human subjects and the daily dosages to be used will not differ significantly from other, clinically used, penicillin antibiotics. The prescribing physician will ultimately determine the appropriate dose for a given human subject, and this can be expected to vary according to the age, weight, and response of the individual patient as well as the nature and the severity of the patient s symptoms. The compounds of this invention will normally be used orally at dosages in the range from 20 to about 100 mg. per kilogram of body weight per day, and parenterally at dosages from about 10 to about 100 mg. per kilogram of body weight per day, usually in divided doses. In some instances it may be necessary to use doses outside these ranges. The following examples and preparations are provided solely for further illustration. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra NMR were measured for solutions in deuterated chldroform .CDCl3 or deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO d6 , and peak positions are reported in parts per million downfield from tetramethylsilane. The following abbreviations for peak shapes are used bs, broad singlet s, singlet d, doublet t, triplet q, quartet, m, multiplet.
