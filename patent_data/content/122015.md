# Air compressor.

## Abstract
An air compressor has a piston 3 reciprocable to compress air within a cylinder 2 . A clutch 16 transmits drive from a drive input shaft 12 driven by external drive means not shown to the piston when compression is required. A piston 27 is arranged to be responsive to pressure resulting from the compressor output and is operable to disenage the clutch 16 and thereby interrupt drive to the compressor piston when said pressure reaches a predetermined value. A passage 37 provides a leakage path for the pressure applied to the piston 27 to enable said pressure to decay in controlled manner when further operation of the piston is required, whereby engagement of the clutch is permitted to occur progressively and shock loadings on the compressor compo nents are minimised.
