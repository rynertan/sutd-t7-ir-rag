# Methods of making Josephson junction devices.

## Abstract
A method of making stable and reliable lead alloy Joseph son junction devices makes use of a method of forming trans versely non conducting metal layers in accordance with the disclosures in European patent applications 83301676.9 and 83305736.7. The base electrodes of the devices are defined by a pat terned layer 21 of transversely non conducting lead alloy, and over this is deposited a layer 23 of lead alloy forming the base electrodes under such conditions that it is transversely non conducting where it overlies the layer 21 . A tunnelling barrier 24 is formed and a transversely non conducting coun ter electrode layer 25 is deposited over this, the layers 23, 24, 25 being formed consecutively without removing the partially formed device from the vacuum chamber. A conduc tive lead 28 makes contact with the layer 25 at an area de fining the tunnelling window, and a contact 36 to the layer 25 makes connection to the base electrode 23 , since the layer 25 is conducting only in the vertical direction. In a modification, the layer 21 is omitted, the base elec trode 23 is of normal conducting material, and the devices are isolated from others on the same substrate by means of grooves 37 , formed, for example, by ion milling.
