# Pigmented printing paste.

## Abstract
A stock emulsion which is a mixture in the form of an o w emulsion consisting essentially of A an alkali thickenable emulsion of a copolymer having a weight average molecular weight of at least 500,000 and being derived from i 2.5 to 40 by weight of an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid containing 3 to 6 carbon atoms, ii 1 to 10 by weight of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer having one crosslinkable functional group selected from the class consisting of the group CHâ‚‚OR wherein R is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a glycidyl group and a hydroxyl group, iii 0 to 3 by weight of a monomer having an ethylenic linkage and at least one sulfonate salt group, and iv 47 to 96.5 by weight of another monomer having an ethylenic linkage, B a basic compound, and C a hydrophobic organic solvent, said mixture containing 3 to 12 by weight of the copolymer and not more than 2 by weight of surface active agents and a colored printing paste for pigment printing comprising the above stock emulsion.
