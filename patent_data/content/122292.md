## Abstract
A data input output apparatus which has a controller 1 , a tape punch 5 , a tape reader 4 and a printer 6 and which can also be operated by commands from a host computer. The printer 6 is provided with a tab set counter 6ca for setting the number of spaces. A predetermined number of spaces is added to the number set in a bit counter 6cc of characters to be printed, and data for printing of a necessary number of spaces is continuously set at the beginning of printing in a print character register 6cg , thereby allowing a predetermined margin to be left at the left end of a printing paper.
