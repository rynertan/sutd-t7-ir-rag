## Description
This invention relates to 2 chloro 3 trifluoromethylbenzaldehyde and to a process for making it. The process for preparing 2 chloro 3 trifluoromethylbenzaldehyde is characterised by the following steps i reacting 2 chloro trifluoromethylbenzene with aC1 C4 alkyl lithium or phenyl lithium, the reaction being carried out in an organic solvent at 6O0C or below ii reacting the product of step i withN,N dimethylformamide DMF at 600C or below and iii reacting the product of step ii with water. Preferred lithiums for use in step i are phenyl, methyl, n butyl, sec. butyl and t butyl lithium. It is most convenient to use n butyl lithium. The preferred organic solvent is dry tetrahydrofuran THF . Step ii is preferably carried out by adding DMF dropwise as a solution in an organic solvent such as dry THF. Steps i and ii must be carried out at low temperature 600c or below and preferably 600 to 800C . Step iii , the reaction with water, is typically carried out at 5 250C. Step iii is most conveniently carried out at room temperature. The product can be isolated and purified conventionally, typically by solvent extraction followed by purification of the crude aldehyde product with sodium bisulphite in a conventional manner.A typical isolation and purification procedure is described in the Example hereinafter. 2 Chloro 3 trifluoromethylbenzaldehyde is especially useful as an intermediate in the preparation of certain pharmaceuticals, namely 4 2 chloro 3 trifluoromethylphenyl 1,4 dShydropyridines which are active calcium antagonists, especially 2 2 aminoethoxymethyl 4 2 chloro 3 trifluoromethylphenyl 3 ethoxy carbonyl 5 methoxycarbonyl 6 methyl l, 4 dihydropyridine. The above process provides a simple, cheap and safe route to 2 chloro 3 trifluoromethylbenzaldehyde in useful yield. The invention is illustrated by the following Example, in which all temperatures are in OC EXAMPLEPreparation of 2 chloro 3 trifluoromethylbenzaldehyde 2 Chloro l trifluoromethylbenzene 5S.15 g was dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran 500 ml and stirred while cooling to 680 under a stream of dry nitrogen. The whole reaction is carried out under dry nitrogen until the addition of distilled water. To this was added n butyl lithium 180 ml of a 1.6 M solution in hexane dropwise keeping the temperature below 60 . After stirring at 680 for a further 2 hours, a solution of dimethylformamide 22 ml in dry tetrahydrofuran 100 ml was added dropwise keeping the temperature below 600. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature slowly over 17 hours and distilled water 200 ml was then added. The organic phase was separated off and the aqueous liquors were extracted with ether 100 ml . The combined ether extracts plus the organic phase were washed with saturated brine, dried MgS04 , filtered and evaporated to give 61.5 g of an orange oil, being the crude title compound. This oil was then added to an aqueous sodium bisulphite solution 65 g in 600 ml distilled water and heated at 60 for 0.5 hours. The solution was extracted with methylene chloride 3 x 100 ml and, after acidification of the aqueous phase with concentrated sulphuric acid to pH 1.0, was heated at 1000 for a further 0.5 hours. The resultant aqueous solution was extracted with methylene chloride 3 x 200 ml and the combined organic extracts were dried MgSOL , filtered and evaporated to give 42 g of a colourless solid which was crystallised from hexane to give the title compound, m.p. 4 4 .
