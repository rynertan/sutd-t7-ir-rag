# A process for the preparation of ethanol.

## Abstract
The preparation of ethanol by catalytic hydration of ethylene to obtain a gaseous reaction mixture which is condensed and washed, yielding an aqueous crude ethanol containing both higher and lower boiling im purities, distilling the aqueous crude ethanol in a first column 2 , discharging a top fraction containing the greater portion of the impurities from the first column 2 , passing the bottom product of the first column 2 d a second distillation column 5 , recovering an etha, nol water azeotrope as a side stream from the upper part of the second column 5 , passing one or more crude streams containing a higher boiling impurities from the lower part of the second column 5 to a third distil lation column 30 , removing a top fraction containing lower boiling impurities from the third colum 30 , dis charging an ethanol containing side stream from the upper part of the third column 30 and removing one more side streams contianing higher boiling impuri ties from a lower part, is characterized in that the top action of the first column 2 is wholly or partly hy drogenated and the hydrogenated product is fractionated to the third column 30 .
