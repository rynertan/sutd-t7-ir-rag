## Abstract
A liquid absorbing laminated structure L which may be used as dressing material or in baby linen, comprises a water permeable facing sheet and a backing sheet having a liquid absorbing material distributed between the sheets. The facing sheet and backing sheet are joined together only at spaced points, lines or areas. The liquid absorbing material may be a hydrocolloidal polymer and may have the property of acting as an adhesive when moistened with water. The spaced points, lines or areas may be provided by the raised portions P of an embossed pattern applied to the sheets. The invention includes processes for the preparation of such liquid absorbing laminates.
