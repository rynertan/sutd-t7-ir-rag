# Integrated semiconductor device including a Bias voltage generator.

## Abstract
An IC semiconductor device includes a bias voltage generator comprising an oscillator OSC , a charge pumping circuit which is driven by the oscillator via a pumping capacitator, and a charge pumping switch 41 . The charge pumping switch 41 is connected in series with the charge pumping circuit. The charge pumping switch is operated by an external electrode PAD . The charge pumping switch is turned OFF by the external electrode substrate leak circuit when measurement of substrate leak current is to be carried out, thereby enabling greater accuracy of measurement.
