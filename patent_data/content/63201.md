## Description
Description of the invention entitled IMPROVEMENTS TO SKIPS FOR CHARGING SCRAP, AAD SKIPS FOR CHARGING SCRAP THUS IMPROVED in the name of DANECO DANIELI FCOLOGIA SpA at Buttrio submitted on under No. This invention concerns improvements to skips for char ging scrap and also skips for charging scrap which adopt said improvements. To be more exact, the improvements concern the possibility of cooling the skips for charging scrap with a Payer of air during the phase when the scrap is pre heated with any desired system. It is known that, in view of the need to save energy in steel mills, the technique of pre heating the scrap is being developed. Said pre heating is carried out either by means of burners using liquid or gaseous fuel and employing air or oxy gen as the supporter of combustion or by means of the employment of the heat dispersed by bidets during their cooling phase or by means of the recovery of fumes generated in the electric furnace and withdrawn from the fourth hole. So as to be able to use these techniques, one of the . problems to be overcome consists of the need to employ skips for the scrap, which whether loose or compressed may be of a a special kind. The problem is caused by the need to prevent deformat ion of the skips taking place owing to the temperature which may be reached by said skips and to resist or lessen the ef fects of the high temperatures reached by tk2 scrap. The usual techniques have recourse to special skips of various kinds. Thus skips exist which have an inner refract ory lining, or which have their walls cooled with water cir culating in an appropriate circumferential jacket, or which are suitable for pre heating the scrap at a low temperature and have their walls cooled with air circulating in an ap propriate circumferential jacket and blown from the outside with suitable nozzles. This invention concerns improvements which enable the. walls of the skips to be cooled with marginal modifications as compared to the normal charging skips. Therefore, the skips which adopt said Improvements are not made of a material resistant to high temperatures nor do they need jackets for the circulation of a cooltng li quid not an inner refractory lining. according to the invention the circumferential walls .of the skips are provided with a plurality of holes like slots or clefts oriented as wished. In this way the gases aspirated from above the skip .draw with them, near the wall of the skip, the substantial ly cooler surrounding air. She invention is therefore embodied in improvements to skips for charging scrap which are used in any desired sys tem for pre heating the scrap, whereby said system can pro vide for suction means cooperating with the skip, said im provements being characterized by the fact that at least . part of the perimeter walls of the skips includes a plural ity of holes oriented as wished. Thts invention also concerns skips for charging scrap which adopt said improvements. The attached table shows a preferential but not rest rtotive lay out of the invention, wherein Fig. I shows a side view of a skip according to the in vention Figs.2 show some possible kinds of holes Figs.3 show some possible orientations of the holes. In any pre heating system, such as the one shown in Fig.I for tnstance, the products of combustton or the fumes asptrated from the electric arc furnace or the hot gases rtsing from the billets cooling off pass through the scrap held in the skip IO from below upwards, moving from a lower chamber II, or other like element, up toxin upper collect ion hood 12. In some cases the flow moves from above downwards and follows a path opposite to the aforesaid path. The hot gases are compelled to follow this path by an aspirator or fan not shown here which arranges for them to be aspirated, whatEver the path may be which they are following. According to the invention the fan aspirating the hot. fumes and or gases provides for the cooling of, the walls of the skip. In fact, at least the wall 14 of the skip IO ts pro vided with holes 13 of any desired shape and size. Said holes 13 can be round, oval, rectangular, square, etc. and they can be laid out tn such a way as to be tn concordance or contrast with, or at right angles to, the flow of the gases or to be oriented in various directions. Fresh atr is aspirated through said holes 13 from the outside. The air which cpmes into the skip IO in this way is not mixed with the fumes but tends to adhere to the inner wall. of the skip and forms a layer which makes tt posstble to obtain a twofold effect of cooltng the skip and insulating.it from high temperature fumes by hindering direct contact.between the fumes and the wall of the skip. The present author has found out by experiments that,. with this system suitably dimensioned and even with a pre .heating temeprature of 500 600 C of the scrap, the temper . aturc of the walls of the skip ts kept at values below 200250 C without any other device being needed. The improvements proposed, therefore, enable at least the following advantages to be obtained pre heating of scrap with normal skips improved according to the invention no complication nor need for modification of the system . of aspiration of fumes or of cooltng the skip. be have descrtbed some variants here, but others are possible. Thus the proportions and sizes can be varied and.it is possible, for instance, to add parts such as shields. or progressive tnlet and or outlet slits tt ts possible to envisage holes 13 having inner rtbs so as to enhance the . turbulence of the atr, etc. These and other variants are ail possible for a technictan tn this field.
