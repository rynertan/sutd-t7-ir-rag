# Methods of manufacturing a dispenser cathode and dispenser cathode manufactured according to the method.

## Abstract
When during the manufacture of a dispenser cathode a cathode body is first manufactured which comprises scan dium oxide, and the emissive material is subsequently provided in the cathode, it is possible to obtain a larger scandium oxide concentration in the cathode surface. This results in a longer life and smaller sensitivity to ion bombardment of the cathode compared with the scandium oxide containing cathodes known so far.
