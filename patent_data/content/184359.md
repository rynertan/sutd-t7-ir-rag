# Measurement of earth porosity at a well.

## Abstract
Earth porosity at a well is measured by irradiating the earth formation with fast neutrons from a source 18 , and using a dual spaced fast epithermal neutron measurement in which the fast neutron popululation is measured at a different source detector spacing 18 to 20 from that used for measuring the epithermal neutron population 18 to 40 .
