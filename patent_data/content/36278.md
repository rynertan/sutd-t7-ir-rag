## Description
DESCRIPTIONPOLYPHENYLENE ETHER RESIN COMPOSITION OF IMPROVED HEAT STABILITY AND SHAPED ARTICLES THEREOF This invention relate. to ti polyphenylene ether resin composition having improved heat stability. Polyphenylene ethers are known resins which are disclosed, for example, in U S Patents 1os. 3306874X 3306875, 3357357, 7 57358 and 4011200 and Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication Iao. 126m0 1975 Since polyphenylene ethers having a mo ecular weight above a certain limit have a high softening point, they are useful in applications which require heat stability. In formulating a polyphenylene ether into resin compositions, however, its high softening point makes it necessary to use higher kneading and extruding temperatures than in the case of other versatile resins, and high temperatures are also required in molding the resin compositions.Moreover, molded articles of the polyphenylene ether resin compositions are frequently used at relatively high temperatures over long periods of time in contrast to those from versatile resins. Because polyphenylene ethers are relatively unstable to heat as is well known, they undergo degradation during extrusion and molding at high temperatures, and result in polyphenylene ether resin compositions and molded articles having degraded properties and or discoloration. These deleterious effects limit widespread utilization of polyphenylene ether resin compositions, and it has been desired to remedy these defects, particularly to improve their heat stability at high temperatures. Various methods have already been proposed for the stabilization of resin compositions containing polyphenylene ethers. These methods are classified into a group involving capping the hydroxyl groups present at the terminals of the polyphenylene ether molecule by acylation, etc., and a group comprising adding various stabilizers to polyphenylene ethers. Known stabilizers used in the latter group include, for example, benzoates U. S. Patent No.3,379,875 , hexa alkylphosphoric triamides or combinations thereof with other compounds U. S.

None of these numerous stabilizers previously proposed have been conducive to the provision of polyphenylene ether resin compositions having fully satisfactory heat stability, particularly at high temperatures, in practical applications0 It is an object of this invention therefore to improve the heat stability of a polyphenylene ether resin composition. Another object of this invention is to provide a polyphenylene ether resin composition having excellent heat stability at high temperatures. Still another object of this invention is to provide a polyphenylene ether resin composition showing inhibited degradation against a long heat history at high temperatures, which can withstand high temperatures during kneading, extrusion and molding and give molded articles having excellent heat stability in long term use at high temperatures.

The grafted polyphenylene ethers used equally to these homopolymers and copolymers in this invention are obtained by grafting vinyl aromatic compounds such as styrene, alpha methylstErene, vinyltoluene and vinylxylene to these homopolymers or copolymers, and include, for example, styrene grafted poly 2,6 dimethyl 1,4 phenylene ether, and a styrene grafted 2,6 dimethylphenol 2, 3,6 trimethylphenol copolymer. Preferably, such grafted polymers have a grafting ratio of about 10 to about 50d o, especially about 20b o to about 40 . Among these polyphenylene ethers, poly 2,6 dimethyl 1,4 phenYlene ether, a 2,6 dimethylphenol 2,3,6 trimethylphenol copolymer, and grafted polyphenylene ethers obtained by grafting styrene to such polymers are especially preferred for use in this invention. The resin matrix in the composition of this invention may be composed of such a polyphenylene ether alone, ora mixture of it with another polymer. The other polymer may be a thermoplastic resin or an elastomer. The thermoplastic resin as referred to herein is a resin containing at least 2Xfo by weight of a recurring structural unit of the following general formula III EMI6.1 wherein R8 represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group, Z represents a halogen atom or a lower alkyl group, and p is O or a positive integer of 1 to 3, in the polymer chain. The lower alkyl group for R8 and Z is, for example, methyl or ethyl, and examples of the halogen atom for Z are chlorine and bromine. Examples of such a thermoplastic resin are polystyrene, a rubber modified polystyrene a high impact polystyrene , a styrene butadiene copolymer, a styrene butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer, a styrene acrylic rubber acryl onitril e copolymer, a styrene alpha metbyl styrene copolymer, and a styrene butadiene block copolymer. At least one such thermoplastic resin can be used in combination with the polyphenylene ether. The thermoplastic resin may be included in the resin matrix in an amount of preferably not more than 9S 0, especially preferably not more than 80 . The elastomer which may be used in this invention is an elastomer in the ordinary sense. Accordingly, the elastomer in this invention, for example, includes polymers having a Young s modulus at ordinary temperature of 105 to 9 dynes cm2 0.1 to 1020 kg cm2 , the Young s modulus being defined at pages 71 to 78 of A. V. Tobolsky, Properties and Structures of Polymers John Wiley Sons,Inc., 1960 . Examples of such an elastomer include polybutadiene, polyisoprene, a nitrile rubber, an ethylene propylene copolymer, an ethylene propylene diene copolymer EPDM , polypentenamer, Thiokol rubbers, polysulfide rubbers, acrylic rubber, a polyurethane rubber, a grafted product formed between a butyl rubber and polyethylene, polyester elastomers, and block copolymers, such as A B A type block copolymers and A B A type block copolymers of diene compounds and vinyl aromatic compounds. In the above A B A type block copolymers andA B A type block copolymers, the terminal blocks A andA are polymer chain blocks of the vinyl aromatic compounds.The central block B in the A B A type block copolymers is a polymer chain block of a conjugated diene, and the central block B in the A B A type block copolymers is a block resulting from the hydrogenation of a polymer chain block of a conjugated diene. In the above description, the diene, diene compound and conjugated diene are used inthe same sense, and may, for example, specifically represent 1,3 butadiene, 2,3 dimethylbutadiene, isoprene, 1,3 pentadiene or a mixture of these The vinyl aromatic compound may, for example, denote styrene, alpha methylstyrene, vinyltoluene, vinyl xylene, ethylvinylxylene, vinylnaphthal ene, or mixtures thereof. Preferably, the aforesaid A B A type block copolymers or A B A type block copolymers are used as the elastomer in this invention The terminal blocks A andA of these block copolymers preferably have a number average molecular eight of about 2,000 to about 100,000, and the central blocks B and B preferably have a number average molecular weight of about 25,000 to about 1,000,000. The elastomer may be included in the resin composition of this invention in an amount of preferably not more than 20 by weight, especially preferably not more than 10 by weight, based on the resin matrix. In the polyphenylene ether resin composition of this invention, the polyphenylene ether may be included in an amount of at least by weight, preferably at least 15 by weight, based on the resin matrix. In the polyphenylene ether resin composition of this invention, the polyphenylene ether resin matrix composed of the polyphenylene ether alone or a mixture of it with tie other polymer contains, dispersed therein, a phosphonous acid or its ester represented by the follow ing formula I EMI8.1 wherein R1 represents an alkyl group, an aryl group which may be substituted by an alkyl group, an aralkyl group which may be substituted by an alkyl group, or a group of the following formula a EMI8.2 in which R4 groups are identical or different alkyl groups, and R2 and R3 are identical or different and each represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an aryl group which may be substituted by an alkyl group, or an aralkyl group which may be substituted by an alkyl group, provided that when E represents the group of formula a , R2 and R3 represent identical or different 2,4 dialkylphenyl groups, which serves to improve the heat stability of the polyphenylene ether. In the definitions of formula I , the alkyl group is preferably an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, amyl, octyl, and decyl. Examples of the aryl or aralkyl group which may be substituted by an alkyl group are phenyl, naphthyl, diphenyl, benzylphenyl, benzyl, triphenylmethyl, methylphenyl, dimethylphenyl, trimethylphenyl and ethylphenyl. The phosphonous acids monophosphonous acids corresponding to general formula I in which R2 and are hydrogen atoms include, for example, the compounds described at page 5 of Gennady M Kosolapoff, Organophosphorus Compounds John Wiley Sons, Inc., 1950 .Specific examples of the phosphonous acids are ethylphosphonous acid, propylphosphonous acid, isopropylphosphonous acid, isobutylphosphonous acid, isoamylphosphonous acid, n octylphosphonous acid, benzylphospho nous acid, triphenylmethylphosphonous acid, phenylphosphonous acid, 3 methylphenylphosphonous acid, 2 methylphenylphosphonous acid, 4methylphenylphosphonous acid, 4ethylphenylphosphonous acid, 2, Ldimethylphenylphosphonous acid, 2,5 dimethylphenylphosphonous acid, 2,4,5 trimethyl phenylphosphonous acid, 2,4, 6 trimethylphenylphosphonous acid, l naphthylphosphonous acid, 2 naphthylphosphonous acid, 4 diphenylphosphonous acid, and 4 benzylphenylphos phonous acid. Monophosphonous acid esters corresponding to general formula I in which R2 and or R3 are other than 3 hydrogen in the above definition can be produced by reacting the aforesaid phosphonous acids with corresponding alcohols or aromatic hydroxy compounds. Examples of these esters include methyl triphenylmethylphosphonite dimethyl, methyl, diisopropyl, dipropyl and diisobutyl phenyl phosphonites diethyl 4 methylphenylphosphonite and diethyl and diphenyl 2,4, 5 trimethylphenylphosphonites. The diphosphonites corresponding to general formula I in which RI represents the group of formula a used in this invention fall into the same category as organic phosphites previously used in that both contain a trivalent phosphorus atom. But the diphosphonites of formula I in which RI represents the group of formula a , are characterized by the fact that because they have much higher hydrolysis resistance than the organic phosphites and possess high heat stability, they do not decompose at high temperatures and they scarcely diissipate by volatilization during molding. Examples of compounds diphosphonites corresponding to general formula I in which RI represents the group of formula a include tetrakis 2,4 di tertO butylphenyl 4,4 biphenylene diphosphonite, tetrakis 2, 4 dimethyl phenyl 4,4 biphenylene diphosphonite, tetrakis 2, 4 diethylphenyl 4, 41 biphenylene diphosphonite, tetrakis 2,4 di n propylphenyl 4,4 biphenylene diphosphonite and tetrakis 2,4 di iso propylphenyl 4,4 biphenylene di phosphonite. These diphosphonites can be prepared, for example, by reacting 4,4 biphenylenediphosphonous acid with the corresponding aromatic hydroxy compounds. The phosphonous acid or its ester represented by general formula I. may be included in an amount of about 0.01 to about 10 parts by weight, preferably about 0005 to about 5 parts by weight, especially preferably about 0.1 to about 3 parts by weight, per 100parts by weight of the resin matrix. The upper limit of this amount for the diphosphonites, however, may be about one seomd of the above specified value in order to obtain the same effect as the phosphonous acids and their monoesters. Accordingly, the diphosphonites may be added in an amount of about 0.01 to about 5 parts by Meight, preferab about 0.05 to about 3 parts by weight, especially preferably about 0.1 to about 1 part by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the resin matri in the resin composition of this invention. Even when these compounds are used in amounts exceeding the above upper limits, the heat stability of the resulting resin composition is not correspondingly improved. Rather, it is frequently deleterious on the properties of the resin composition, resulting in lowered heat distortion temperatures, for example. If the amount of the stabilizer compound is below the specified limit, the heat stability of the resin composition is not improved to the expected extent. The resin composition of this invention shows better heat stability by dispersing both the above phosphonous acid or its ester and at least one sterically hindered phenol in the matrix resin. It is believed that the better heat stability is due to the synergistic action of the two kinds of stabilizer compounds. Examples of sterically hindered phenols which can be effectively used in this invention include monohydric phenols such as 2,6 di tert. butyl p cresol, 2 tert. butyl 4methoxyphenol, 2,4 dinonylphenol, octadecyl 3 3,5 di tert. butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate, diethyl 3,5 di tert. butyl 4hydroxybenzylphosphonate, and 2 3 ,5 di tert. butyl 4 hydroxyanilino 4,6 dioctylthio 1,3,5 triazine dihydric phenols such as 2,2 methylenebis 4 methyl 6 tert. butylphenol , 2,2 methylenebis 4ethyl 6 tert. butylphenol , butylidenebis methyl butylphenol , 4,4 thiobis 6 tert, butyl 5methylphenol , 1, l bis 4hydroxy phenyl cyclohexane, 1, hexanediol bis 3 3, 5 di tert. butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate, 2,2 thiodiethyl bis 3,5 ditert. butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate and N,N hexa methylenebis 3, 5 di tert. butyl 4 hydroxyhydrocinnamide trihydric phenols such as lk3,5 tris 4 tert. butyl 3 hydroxy 2,6 dimethylbenzyl isocyanuric acid, 2,4,6 tris 3 ,5 di tert. butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl 1,3,5 triazine, a trieste of 3, 5 di tert. butyl 4hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid with 1,3,5 tris 2 hydroxyethyl S triazine 2,4,6 lH, 3H, SH trione and 1,1,3 tris 2 methyl 4 hydroxy 5 tert. butylphenyl butane and tetrahydric phenols such as pentaerythri tyltetraki sC 3 3, 5 di t ert . butyl 4 hydroxy phenyl propionate . The sterically hindered phenol may be included in the resin composition of this invention in an amount of about 0.05 to about 10 parts by weight, preferably about 0.1 to about 5 parts by weight, especially preferably about 0.5 to about 3 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the matrix resin. The resin composition of this invention shows much better heat stability by dispersing an organic monophosphite or organic polyphosphite as well as the phosphonous acid or its ester and the sterically hindered phenol in the resin matrix. Examples of effective organic phosphites for use in this invention include organic monophosphites such as triphenyl phosphite, tricresyl phosphite, triisooctyl phosphite, tridecyl phosphite, tri 2 ethylhexyl phosphite, trioctadecyl phosphite, tri octylphenyl phosphite, tri nonylphenyl phosphite, tridodecylthio phosphite, phenyldiethyl phosphine, phenyl di 2 ethylhexyl phosphite, isooctyldiphenyl phosphite, diisooctylmonophenyl phosphite and di 2 ethylhexyl mono isooctylphenyl phosphite and organic polyphosphites such as a phosphite resin of hydrogenated bisphenol A. Among these organic phosphites, the organic polyphosphites are preferred. An organic monophosphite may be used in combination with an organic polypho sphite. The organic phosphite may be included into the resin composition of this invention in an amount of about 0.05 to about 10 parts.by weight, preferably about 0.1 to about 5 parts by weight, especially preferably about 0.5 to about 3 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the resin forming the matrix The resin composition of this invention may further contain various additives depending upon the intended uses.Examples of the additives include lubricants, such as olefin waxes typified by polyethylene wax and polypropylene wax phosphate type fire retardants typified by triphenyl phosphate or tricresyl phosphate bromine type fire retardants typified by decabromobiphenyl pentabromotoluene or decabromobiphenyl ether pigments typified by titanium dioxide or zinc oxide inorganic fillers typified by glass fibers, asbestos, wollastonite, mica or talc and organic fillers typified by carbon fibers. The amounts of these additives vary depending upon their types, but should be within the ranges which do not degrade the heat stability .of the resin composition of this invention. The resin composition of this invention can be easily produced by melt mixing methods known with regard to thermoplastic resins. For example, it can be prepared conveniently by a method which comprises mixing the polyphenylene ether or a mixture of it with another polymer such as a thermoplastic resin or elastomer, with predetermined amounts of the phosphonous acid or its ester, and optionally the sterically hindered phenol and optionally the organic phosphite in a mixer, then kneading the mixture fully in a melt extruder, and pelletizing the resulting homogeneous molten mixture.
