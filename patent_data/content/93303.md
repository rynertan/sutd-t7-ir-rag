# Speech recognition system for an automotive vehicle.

## Abstract
A speech recognition system in which the gain, at which the spoken instruction signal including noise transduced through a microphone 2 is amplified, is adjustably fixed at an appropriate level determined according to the smoothed background noise level obtained after a recognition switch 3 has been released but before a spoken instruction is uttered toward the microphone, in such a way that the gain is inversely proportional to the background noise level. In the system according to the present invention, it is possible to reliably detect a spoken instruction even if background noise level fluctuates intensely just before or after the spoken instruction is uttered toward the microphone. The system comprises a level detector 22 , a sample holding circuit 21, a gain controller 20 , in addition to a conventional speech recognizer 100 .
