## Description
A PROCESS FOR THE INCORPORATION OF FOREIGN DNA INTO THE GENOMEOF MONOCOTYLEDONOUS PLANTSThe invention relates to a process for the incorporation of foreign DNA into the genome of monotyledonous plants, by infecting the plants or incubating the plant protoplasts with bacteria suitable or made suitable for that purpose.A number of bacteria, such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens andAgrobacterium rhizogenes are by nature capable of manipulating plant cells genetically. The said bacteria adhere to the plant cell wall and subsequently introduce a fragment of DNA into the plant cell via a process still unexplained. This DNA fragment the T DNA is as T region in the bacteria a part of a large plasmid 120 150 Mdal. , which in case of A. tumefaciens is calledTi plasmid and in case of A. rhizogenes Ri plasmid. The T DNA is then integrated into the nucleus genome of the plant cell Thomashow, M.F., et al. 1980 , Proc. Nat.Acad.Sci. USA 77 6448 6452 . Genes positioned in the T DNA express therein and see to it that the plant cell will behave like a tumour cell Ooms, C., et al 1981 , Gene 14 3 3 50 .Meanwhile methods have been developed to couple no matter which DNA to the T region in such a way that this can subsequently be introduced into the plant cell simultaneously with the T region Hille, J. et al 1983 ,J. Bacteriol. 154 693 701 and Hoekema, A. et al 1983 , Nature 303 179 180 . From the T region the onc genes can be removed Hille J., et al 1983 , Plant Mol. Biol. 2 155 163 andZambryski, P., et al 1983 , EMBO J. 2 2143 2150 . This results in vectors which are indeed transmitted by the bacteria to the plant cell, but which are no longer oncogeneous Hille, J., et al 1983 , Plant Mol. Boil. 2 155 163 and Zambryski, P., et al 1983 ,EMBO J. 2 2143 2150 .Plant cells transformed with these tamedH vectors can regenerate to plants having new properties encoded by the genes introduced into the T region Zambryski P., et al 1983 ,EMBO J. 2 2143 2150 .If Rhizobium bacteria are provided with plasmids such as meant above, or plasmids derived therefrom, they are also capable of the genetic manipulation of plant cells Hooykaas et al 1977 . Now, it has appeared from experiments with mutants of Agrobacterium and with strains of Rhizobium occurring in nature that in addition to the said plasmids also particular other sequences of the bacterial DNA are necessary, for instance the sequence responsible for the adherence of the bacteria to the cell wall. The above means that Agrobacterium is not the only organism capable of inserting of T DNA into the plant genome.There are other bacteria which are capable hereof if they are provided with the plasmids or derivatives thereof ultimately originating from Agrobacterium. A conditio sine qua non is in this respect that they avail of the necessary attendant DNA sequences such as described above, or functional analogues thereof and that no inherent impediments for the transfer of DNA are present.It also appeared in research work of our group performed earlier that it is not absolutely necessary that the plasmid genes for virulence and the T DNA are actually positioned on plasmids. For instance the T DNA may be situated on the bacterial chromosome, whilst the plasmid genes for cirulence are positioned on an independent plasmid.According to literature data the said systems can be used as a vector only for dicotyledonous plants, since only dicotyledonous plants respond on Agrobacteria with tumour formation Lippincott, J.A. Lippincott, B.B. 1975 , Ann.Rev.Microbiol.29 377 407 . The fact that the cell wall of monocotyledonous plant differs from that of dicotyledonous plants would be the cause Lippincott, J.A. Lippincott, B.B. 1980 .In Bacterial Adherence in Receptors and Redognition E.H. Beachley, ed. , pages 377 396 and Rao, S.S. et al 1982 , Physiol. Plant. 56 374 380 . So, the prevailing opinion is that the said plasmids are not suitable as a vector for the genetic manipulation of monocotyledonous plants Flavell, R. Mathias, R. 1984 , Nature 307 108 109 . But among the monocotyledonous plants there are highly important agricultural and horticultural crops, such as the grains and bulbous plants like tulip, daffodil and lily. The research performed described hereinunder was carried out in order to see whether the prevailing opinion about the absence of possibilities to use the Ti plasmid as a vector for monocotyledonous plants was correct indeed.In this research various species of monocotyledonous plants were infected with A. tumefaciens strans, which either possessed various types of Ti or Ri plasmids separately or accomodated a combination of such plasmids.Surprisingly, it appeared from the experiments that cells of monocotyledonous plants were positively transformed by A. tumefaciens.This showed for the first time that the Ti plasmid or plasmids derived therefrom is suitable for the genetic manipulation of monocotyledonous plants. Experiment In the T DNA in addition to onc genes, which see to phytohormone synthesis coombs G., et al 1981 , Gene 14 33 50 and GarfinkelD.J., et al 1981 , Cell 27 143 153, there are also genes which encode for enzymes which see to the biosynthesis of opines . These are tumour specific amino acidcerivatives, such as octopine and nopaline tempt, J. Goldman, A. 1982 in Molecular Biology of Plant Tumours G. Kahl J. Schell, eds. , pages 427 449.Opines do not occur in normal plant cells and so can be considered as specific indicators for incorporation and expression of T DNA in the plant cell, even if there would not be question of transformation leading to formation of tumour cells. There are various types of T DNA which carry genes for enzymes which see to the biosynthesis of different opines. The most well known are the octopine and resp. nopaline T DNA s.A great number of tests was now carried out in which monocotyledonous plants from the family of Liliaceae Chlorophytum capense and the family of Amaryllidaceae Narcissus cv. Paperwhite were wounded and subsequently infected with various A. tumefaciens strains. The strains used were LBA288 avirulent no Ti plasmid ,LBA1010 contains an octopine Ti plasmid , LBA2318 contains a nopaline Ti plasmid , LBA1020 contains a Ri plasmid , LBA2347 contains a nopaline Ti plasmid Ri plasmid , LBA1516 contains an octopine Ti plasmid with a Vir mutation avirulent . After a few weeks plant material was removed from the infection sites and analysed for opines Otten, L.A.B.M. Schilperoort, R.A. 1978 Biochim. Biophys. Acta 527 497 500 . It is to be remarked that after infection with virulent strains often a slight thickening around the wound was to be observed. Thick tumours were not formed.In the case of infection with avirulent strains no thickening was observed at all. Plant material isolated from non wounded or wounded, but noninfected monocotyledonous plants appeared to contain neither octopine nor nopaline. Opines were not discovered either in plant material isolated from plants infected with the avirulent strains of LBA288 or LBA1516. However, plant cells obtained from wound sites infected with virulent A. tumefaciens strains appeared to contain nearly always opines. After infection with a strain with an octopine Ti plasmid LBA1010 octopine appeared to be present, whilst after infection with strains with a nopaline Ti plasmid LBA2318, LBA2347 nopaline appeared to be present.The results obtained with strain LBA2347 gave the most reproducible positive results. All these data together tender evidence that A. tumefaciens is capable of transmitting T DNA to monocotyledonous plant cells, and furthermore that T DNA genes at any rate those involved for the enzymes in che biosynthesis of opines express in monocotyledonous plant cells Consequently, it can be concluded that the Ti plasmid is suitable as a vector for monocotyledonous plant cells. Furthermore, the conclusion can be drawn that the regulator zones which see to the expression of the opine synthesis are function regions and so suitable as buildingstones for making chimaeric genes which should express in monocotyledonous plant cells.Consequently, the invention relates to a process for incorporating foreign DNA into monocotyledonous plants by infecting the plants or incubating plant protoplasts with bacteria suitable or made suitable for that purpose which avail of one or more tumourinducing plasmids, for instance Ti or Ri plasmids, or derivatives thereof, or parts thereof, originally originating from Agrobacterium bacteria. Preferably, use is made of the Agrobacterium bacteria, which has at least one plasmid which has the Vir region of a Ti tumour inducing plasmid but no T region and at least one other plasmid which has a Ti region with built in it foreign DNA but no Virregion.For the Agrobacterium bacteria, which are suitable for the process according to the invention as well as for the way in which these bacteria can be obtained rights were already claimed in the non prepublished European patent application 84200239.6.For expressing foreign genes in monocotyledonous plant cells use can be made of the regulator regions of T DNA genes, in particular the genes for octopine synthesis and nopaline synthesis.
