# TRIP COMPUTER FOR VEHICLES

## Abstract
A vehicle trip computer 1 11 for detecting the distance traveled by a vehicle and the amount of fuel remaining in the fuel tank and computing and displaying the capable travel distance of the vehicle through the desired computational operations in accordance with the detected data. During the initial period following the connection of the trip computer to the power source, the capable travel distance of the vehicle is computed by using a predetermined initial gas mileage in place of the computed gas mileage. Also, the trip computer does not replace the initial gas mileage with the computed actual gas mileage until the distance traveled by the vehicle exceeds a predetermined distance.
