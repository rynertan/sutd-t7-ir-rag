# Drum brake.

## Abstract
A drum brake 10 includes a rotatable brake drum 16 and a pair of brake shoes 12, 14 which are engageable with the brake drums 16 . A non rotatable backing plate 24 slidably carries the pair of brake shoes 12, 14 . The brake shoes 14, 12 pivotally anchor at one end to a pin 32 secured to the backing plate 24 . An extendible member 36 adjustably spaces apart the other ends 34 of the brake shoes 12, 14 to maintain a desired running clearance between the brake shoes 12, 14 and the brake drum 16 . One of the brake shoes 14 carries a lever 48 which drivingly engages a ratchet wheel 46 of the extendible member 36 . The lever carries a pin 60 which is slidably and rotatably received in an arcuate guide slot 58 of the backing plate 24 . A brake application with forward brake drum rotation causes the lever 48 to slide along the arcuate slot 58 and to remain substantially stationary relative to the extendible member 36 . A reverse brake application causes the one brake shoe 14 to shift in a direction nearly perpendicular to the arcuate guide slot 58 so that the lever 48 is pivoted relative to the extendible member 36 . The lever 48 engages with a successive tooth of the ratchet wheel 46 if the running clearance of the brake is greater than the desired value. An adjustment of the extendible member 36 is effected to diminish the running clearance of the brake to the desired value.
