# Ring spinning or twisting machine having a device for the automatic and simultaneous removal of all full cops.

## Abstract
During the cop forming phase of operation of a ring spinning or twisting machine, yarn 8 is wound onto spools 12 carried by the spindles 1, 4 in order to form cops 11 . At the end of this phase, the yarn 8 associated with each spindle is fastened below the spool by means of several fastening turns 29 thereafter, the full cops 11 are removed with breakage of the yarns 8 . In order to facilitate the operation of cop removal means for automatically and simultaneously removing all of the full cops 11 , yarn separation means 24, 25 are provided that separate the yarns 8 prior to the cop removal means pciking up the full cops 11 . In a preferred embodiment, the yarn separation means 24, 25 is arranged to snap the yarns 8 by downwardly displacing the members 18, 19 around which the fastening turns 29 are wound.
