Example 7Production of 3 D alpha 4 ethyl 2,3 dioxo 1 piperazinecarboxamido oc phenylacetamidol 4 trifluoromethyl 2 azetidinone 1 sulphonic acid tetrabutylammonium saltEMI22.1 In a nitrogen stream, D alpha 4 ethyl 2,3 dioxo 1 piperazinecarboxamido phenylacetic acid 95 mg, 0.28 mM was dissolved in dry methylene chloride, 76 mg of oxalyl chloride and one drop of dimethylformamide were added with ice cooling, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for an hour. The solvent was evaporated off under reduced pressure, and 4 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran were added to obtain an acid chloride solution.Separately, in a nitrogen stream, 3 amino t tri fluoromethyl 2 azetidinone 1 sulphonic acid 30 mg, .15 mM and dimethylaminopyridine 5 mg, 0.04 mM ere dissolved in 1 ml of dry dimethylfornamide, and diisopropylethylamine 55 mg, 0.5 nM was added thereto to obtain a uniform solution. This solution was cooled to 10 to 50C, and the solution of the acid chloride in tetrahydrofuran obtained above was added dropwise thereto. The reaction was effected at 100 to 50C for 30 minutes and further at room temperature for an hour. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was poured into 10 ml of ice water, the pH was adjusted to 6.5 7.0 with aqueous NaHCO3 solution, the tetrahydrofuran was evaporated off under reduced pressure, and the aqueous layer was washed with 10 ml of ethyl acetate. The pH of the aqueous layer was adjusted to 2.5 with 5 hydrochloric acid, and was then washed twice with 10 ml of ethyl acetate.The pH of the aqueous layer was adjusted to 6.5 7.0, then 50 mg of tetrabutylammonium hydrogensulphate were added, the extraction with 15 ml of methylene chloride was conducted three times. The methylene chloride layers were combined, washed with 10 ml of water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, and the solvent was evaporated off. Diethyl ether was added to the residue to precipitate the product, namely 63 mg yield 55 of the crude title compound as an oil. neat 1 IRxmax cm 3300, 2950, 2850, 179O, 1670, 1250, 1150, 1035.

To this reaction mixture was added dropwise a mixed solution of 3 amino 4 trifluoromethyl 2 azetidinone 1 sulphonic acid 102 mg, 0.50 mM , 6 ml of dry methylene chloride and 240 jil of diisopropylethylamine.Reaction was effected at 100C for an hour, and then at room temperature for 2 hours. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was dissolved in 20 ml of ice water, the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with 20 ml of ethyl acetate, and the aqueous layer was concentrated to 5 ml under reduced pressure. The aqueous layer was then purified by column chromatography using Amberlite XAD 2 a highly porous polymer produced by Rohm Haas Co. and a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and water 1 10 as an eluting agent, and by freeze drying to obtain 29 mg yield 15 of the title compound.
