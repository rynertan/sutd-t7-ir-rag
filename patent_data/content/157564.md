# Separation of gaseous mixtures.

## Abstract
A gas can be separated by condensation from a gaseous mixture by exposing the mixture to reduced temperature in a chamber 2 having an outlet 5 . The outlet contains a restric tive structure 9 , such as a sintered glass filter disc, on which a thin film of the condensed liquid forms. Liquid is drawn off through the restrictive structure 9 whilst the film is replen ished so that a barrier layer of the liquid which seals the outlet 5 is continuously maintained. The gas may be ozone made from electrical treatment of oxygen and the resulting liquid ozone may be used for water purification.
