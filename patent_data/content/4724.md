## Abstract
Coalescer cartridge comprises a fixed end support plate, a moveable end support plate attached to an actuating rod and a plurality of fibres or bundles of fibres. Each fibre or bundle is secured at one end to one end plate and at its other end to the other end plate. In use the end plates are positioned close to one another by movement of the rod so that the fibres are compressed together to form a fine network. The cartridge is suitable for use in coalescing emulsions of oil and water and removing any suspended solids. When the cartridge becomes blocked it is easily regenerated by causing relative motion between the end plates to stretch the fibres and open up the network. Contaminants are then removed by flushing with wash liquid.

## Description
SEPARATION EQUIPMENT This invention relates to apparatus and a method for removing contaminants from a liquid. The contaminants may be solid particles and or a second liquid immiscible with but finely dispersed in the first liquid. In operations in which large quantities of oil contaminated water are produced as effluent, e.g., oil refining and washing ships tanks, the feed water is frequently taken from nearby sources, e.g., the sea or a river. After use of the water, the effluent is returned ultimately to a natural source. Before returning effluent directly to a source, or indirectly via a sewage system, contaminating oil must be removed. The converse problem also exists, i.e., the removal of contaminating water from oil. In the production of crude oil from an oilfield it is usual for the oil initially produced to be substantially free from water. However, during the life of the oilfield the proportion of water produced with the crude oil usually increases and a point is reached when it may be desirable to separate the oil from the produced water before transporting the oil from the wellhead either by pipeline or tanker. In both cases, solid particles are usually present together with the contaminated liquid. Several devices for dealing with either or both problems are known, but coalescing cartridges having rigid elements have, in general, proved to be the most popular.These, however, suffer from certain disadvantages. The element, frequently a glass fibre element, acts both as a coalescing medium and as a filter The filtration effect means that the cartridge eventually becomes blocked by the suspended solids removed from the stream under treatment.When this happens, the cartridge must be discarded. This is undesirable, partly because of the cost of cartridges, but even more so on offshore platforms because of the supply, storage and disposal problems entailed. We have now devised equipment which is suitable for improving the quality of either water contaminated with oil or oil contaminated with water and which is compact and easily regenerable by back washing. Thus according to the present invention there is provided a coalescer cartridge for removing contaminants from a liquid which cartridge comprises a fixed first end support plate, a moveable second end support plate moveable relative to the first plate and fixed to an actuating rod, and a plurality of fibres or bundles of fibres, each fibre or bundle being secured at one end to the first end support plate and at its other end to the second end support plate. In use, the end plates are positioned close to one another by movement of the rod so that the fibres are compressed together to form a fine network. Suitable fibre materials include natural and synthetic products such as wool, cotton, viscose, polyamides, polyesters, polyolefins and minerals. In general, fibre diameters are in the range 1 1,000 micron and the fibres are preferably made into bundles up to 30 mm in diameter. The cartridge preferably has a length in the range 1 mm to 1 m in the compressed state and a length in the range 10 mm to 10 m in the stretched state. The cartridge preferably has a length to diameter ratio in the range 1,000 1 to 1 1 in the compressed state. By length in the above context is meant the distance between the end plates. The cartridge is conveniently utilised in equipment comprising a container having an inlet and an outlet, the cartridge being interposed between them. Preferably a settling zone is provided downstream of the coalescer cartridge to allow the coalesced droplets of the previously dispersed phase to settle. Preferably there are two outlets from the settling zone so that separate liquid streams can be discharged. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for coalescing one immiscible liquid finely dispersed in another which method comprises passing a feedstock mixture of the liquids through coalescing equipment as hereinbefore described wherein the coalescer cartridge is in the compressed state, and recovering separated liquids. The method of the invention is particularly suitable for removing crude petroleum and petroleum products from tanker washings and refinery effluent. Normally these contain from 5 to 750 mg of crude petroleum or petroleum products per kg of water. In general, the amount of suspended solids is very variable, however, typical effluents contain 10 to 500 ppm of suspended solids. If solid suspended material is present, this is trapped in the cartridge and does not interfere with the coalescence of the liquids. By altering the material of the fibre and the extent of compression of the cartridge, the degree of filtration can be regulated. In the following discussion of the mechanism of coalescence, a dispersion of traces of oil in water is considered as a typical feedstock for treatment. However, the invention is also applicable to the coalescence of droplets of water dispersed in oil. The flow rate of the contaminated water should be related to the fibre diameter in the beds, the cross sectional area of the beds and the extent of compression of the fibres, so that some turbulence is created in the liquid as it flows through the cartridge but not sufficient turbulence to prevent the deposition of a film of oil on the fibres nor to strip a deposited film off. This favours the movement of oil droplets across the stream lines in the winding passages in the network of the cartridge so that they will collide with the oil film on the fibres and with each other. Droplets colliding with the oil film trap oil which can be collected. Colliding with each other leads to growth in the size of droplets. If the water velocity is too great, however, the resulting increased turbulence strips the oil film from the fibres and breaks up oil droplets, thereby reversing the above effects. Optimum flow rates can be chosen for given cartridge dimensions and fibre diameteres in the cartridge. In general, the hydraulic loading of liquid flowing through the equipment is in the range 15 150 3 3 In use, as stated previously, the cartridge is operated with the fibres compressed. After an extended period of operation the cartridge may become blocked with solids and or liquid causing an unacceptably high pressure drop and reducing the efficiency of coalescence. The cartridge is then easily regenerated by causing relative motion between the end plates to stretch the fibres, and open up the network to a series of relatively wide channels. The contaminants are then removed by flushing with wash liquid to wash them off. The invention is illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawing and examples. The drawing is a diagrammatic representation of a coalescer according to the present invention with the fibres of the cartridge in the stretched condition. A chamber 1 is fitted with an inlet 2 and an outlet 3. Within the chamber a cartridge coalescer comprises a threaded rod 4 to which is fixed a perforated end plate 5. At its other end the rod 4 passes freely through a second perforated end plate 6 fixed in position relative to the chamber 1. Fibres 7 are shown stretched between the end plates 5 and 6. A nut 8 is threaded on to the rod 4 and bears against the end plate 6. In use, the nut 8 is tightened to withdraw the rod and move the end plate 5 closer to the end plate 6 to compress the fibres 7 to the desired extent. Water contaminated with finely dispersed oil enters the chamber 1 through inlet 2 and passes through the perforations in end plate 5 into the network of fibres 7 where coalescence takes place. Larger droplets of oil and water pass out of the chamber through the performations in end plate 6 and flow to a settling zone not shown where the oil and water form separate layers.

Before the run the bed was expanded and ca 5 litres of water passed through in the normal flow direction to flush out oil and solids collected in the bed It was then compressed to a depth of 35 mm.EMI6.2 tb HoursLlpHydraulic SEP SeparatorOil SEP Oil SEP Oil tb on SEP Residence SEP Content SEP Content SEP Removal tb SEP on SEP Loading SEP Time SEP In SEP Out SEP Efficiency tb Stream SEP bars SEP m mê h SEP min SEP mg litremg litre SEP tb SEP SEP 1 SEP 1.4 SEP 53 SEP 5 SEP 455 SEP 9 SEP 98 tb SEP 2¹ SEP 2.0 SEP SEP 79 SEP 3.3 SEP 335 SEP 11 SEP 97 tb SEP 4¹ SEP 2,4 SEP 105 SEP 2.5 SEP 260 SEP 19 SEP 93 tb SEP 6 SEP 2.5 SEP 132 SEP 2 SEP 209 SEP 36 SEP 83 tb The performance of the coalescer deteriorates somewhat at high hydraulic loadings. Example 3 The bed used was that in Example 2, expanded, washed through and recompressed to 25 mm depth. For this run, water was passed at a hydraulic loading 32 of 27 m m h. A solution of oxalic acid was metered in upstream at a rate which gave a concentration of 50 mg litre in the main water flow. This reacted with the natural calcium in the water to give a precipitate of calcium oxalate. This precipitate was removed by the bed to give a clear effluent stream. The pressure drop across the bed rose to 3.6 bar after 1 hour. This run demonstrates that the device is an effective filter unit. Example 4 The bed for this run was that from Example 3, expanded, flushed through and compressed to 25 mm depth. The initial pressure drop was 0.8 bar. This indicates that washing in the expanded state serves to remove solids from the bed. The test procedure was the same as inExample 3 except that oil was also added at the rate of 370 mg litre. The filtrate was again clear, and the oil content of the effluent was only 2 mg litre. This run indicates that the unit can be operated as a combined filter and coalescer, and will coalesce oil in the presence of solids.Coalescer B larger version of Coalescer A Material Wool double knitting Amount 288 quadruple strands 265 mm long extended Bed diameter 75 mm 2 Bed cross sectional area 0.00427 m Separator volume 10.5 litres Example 5 The device was tested on a refinery effluent product in a kerosine washing plant. The effluent was acidic with a pH of 2. The unit operated for 20 hours at a hydraulic loading 32 of 45 m3 m2 h in which time the pressure drop rose from 0.4 to 0.9 bar, as shown in the following Table. In fluent oil concentration varied between 220 and 2,180 mg litre with an average at 1,330 mg litre. The water stream from the coalescer unit ranged from 9 to 23 mg litre with an average of 15 mg litre. This gives an oil removal efficiency of 99 per cent. Of this oil, ca 8 ppm was soluble accounting for the free oil in the effluent ranging from 1 to 15 mg litre with an average of 7 mg litre, or a free oil removal efficiency of 99.5 per cent. This run demonstrates that the device will function satisfactorily on plant effluent.EMI8.1 tb Oil SEP OilContent SEP Oil tb Hours SEP BedDepth SEP AP SEP mg litre SEP Removal tb SEP on SEP Efficiency tb SEP Stream SEP Efficiency tb SEP 0 SEP 265 SEP 0.4 tb SEP 1 SEP 265 SEP 0.4 SEP 220 SEP 16 SEP 93 tb SEP li SEP 103 SEP 0.7 tb SEP 2 SEP 0.7 SEP 160 SEP 13 SEP 92 tb SEP 4 SEP 0.7 SEP 465 SEP 9 SEP 98 tb 20 SEP t0.9 SEP 2180 SEP 23 SEP 99 tb Example 6 Coalescer B was again tested using oil contaminated with water from a separation rig.
