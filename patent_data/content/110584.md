# Machine workhead with magnetic driver.

## Abstract
An electromagnet means is disposed between a pair of bearings rotatably mounting a spindle in the housing of a machine workhead, such as the workhead of a grinding machine. The magnetic flux from the electromagnet means if guided by the spindle extending therethrough to its workpart driving end located outside the housing. Bearing shoes or other means engaging the workpart are connected to the housing so as to complete the magnetic flux path to the electromagnet means through the housing. Nonmagnetic shields are disposed between the bear ings and electromagnet means and housing to prevent wear debris accumulation and etching of the bearing components from magnetic flux effects.
