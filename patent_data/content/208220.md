## Description
CONTROL OF SO EMISSION DE77,872 C1 FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a process for removing a gaseous sulfur compound from a mixture of gases containing sulfur oxides. More particularly, it relates to fluid catalytic cracking under conditions whereby the sulfur oxide content of the regenerator off gas is lowered. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION As is well known to those skilled in the art, when sulfur containing charge hydrocarbons are admitted to a fluid catalytic cracking FCC reactor, the charge is converted to lower boiling products including those falling within the motor fuel boiling range. A portion of the sulfur in the charge hydrocarbon is liberated in the reactor as hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans which may be separated from the FCCU cracked products. A portion of the sulfur is fixed on the coke containing spent catalyst which is passed from the reaction zone to the regeneration zone wherein an oxygen containing gas is provided to regenerate the spent catalyst. The gas formed during regeneration includes oxides of carbon as the coke is burned from the surface of the catalyst.The gas so formed also includes oxides of sulfur principally sulfur dioxide plus some sulfur trioxide and these oxides of the sulfur may be the predominant undesirable species in the regenerator off gas. Economic considerations prevent the effective removal of sulfur oxides from the regenerator off gas and environmental considerations dictate that they be decreased. Prior art attempts include operation under conditions such that the sulfur in the regeneration zone is fixed on the catalyst thereby lowering the SO content of the regener x ator off gas and the sulfur is released as additional mercaptan and hydrogen sulfide in the reaction zone. Here these sulfur compositions may be readily passed to effluent separation operations which would not be the case for sulfur containing gases recovered as regenerator waste gas Illustrative of prior art endeavors in this area include those disclosed in U.S.P. 4,344,926 which issuedAugust 17, 1982 to Texaco Inc. as assignee of Randall H.Petty and Burton H. Bartley the text of which is incorporated herein by reference and the prior art cited therein. It is an object of this invention to provide a process for removing a gaseous sulfur compound from a mixture of gases containing sulfur oxides. Other objects will be apparent to those skilled in the art. STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION In accordance with certain of its aspects, this invention is directed to a process for removing a gaseous sulfur compound from a mixture of gases containing sulfur oxides which comprises contacting said mixture of gases containing sulfur oxides at 8000F 15000F 4270C 8160C with a composite containing a porous refractory support bearing as a first component i at least one of bismuth, chromium, or a rare earth metal, such as cerium and as a second component ii at least one alkali metal. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The mixture of gases which may be treated by the process of this invention include gases which contain sulfur oxides and commonly such gases are found to contain, as the principal oxide of sulfur, sulfur dioxide with lesser quantities of sulfur trioxide. In the preferred embodiment, this invention finds use in connection with fluid catalytic cracking FCC wherein a charge hydrocarbon is subjected to cracking conditions include temperature of 800 F 1200 F 4270C 6490C , typically 9600F 5160C to yield cracked product containing hydrocarbons boiling in the motor fuel boiling range. When the charge to cracking typically a gas oil contains sulfur, a portion of this sulfur is reduced in the reaction zone to hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans which are recovered with the cracked product from which they may readily be separated. During reaction, the fluid catalyst particles become deactivated as they are covered with coke and they also pick up a substantial portion of sulfur. This spent catalyst is passed to a regeneration zone wherein spent catalyst is contacted with oxygen containing gas, typically air, at 11000F 15000F 5950C 8150C , typically 13500F 7320C t and under these conditions, the spent catalyst is regenerated and may thereafter be returned to the reaction zone. During regeneration, the coke content of the spent catalyst is oxidized to form regenerator off gas including carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Sulfur in the spent catalyst is oxidized to form sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide.The content of SOX oxides of sulfur in the regenerator off gas, when the initial sulfur containing charge contains 0.5 w 2.5 W , say 2 wt sulfur, may be as high as 4 w 5 w , say 5 wE of the sulfur content of the charge hydrocarbon to the reaction zone. The SO content of regenerator off gas under these conditions may be 2000 3000 ppm v , say 2500 ppm v . It is a feature of the process of this invention that the SOX content of these sulfur containing gases may be reduced by contacting these gases at 800 F 1500 F 4270C 8150C , preferably 10000F 15000F 595 C 815 C say 1350OF 7320C with a composite containing a porous refractory support bearing as a first component i at least one of bismuth, chromium, or a rare earth metal such as cerium and as a second component ii at least one alkali metal, preferably potassium or sodium or cerium. The porous refractory support which may be employed in practice of the process of this invention may be active or inactive or inert. Typical of such supports may be alumina e.g. gamma alumina , silica, magnesia, silica alumina, silica magnesia, mordenite, zeolites, etc.When toe SOx containing gases are passed from the regeneration zone to a separate conversion zone, the support may be any convenient support whether active or inactive or inert and may be of a particle size comparable to that utilized in fluid bed operations e.g. 20 200 microns or that utilized in fixed bed operations e.g. 0.1 1 inch . Is is, however, preferred in the case of FCC operations, that the support be of particle size suitable for use in FCC operations 20 200 microns . Although it is possible to utilize, as the support for removing gaseous sulfur compounds, the fluidized catalyst which is used inFCC operations, it is preferred that this support be a different phase i.e. even in those instances when it is the same composition as the support for the FCC catalyst or as the FCC catalyst , it is preferred that it be formulated separately and thereafter mixed with the FCC catalyst. Typical equilibrium FCC catalysts may incline that marketed byDavison Chemical Division of W. R. Grace and Company under the trademark CBZ 1 containing a synthetic crystallineY type zeolite in an amorphous silica alumina matrix having the following characteristics TABLE I Cracking Catalyst Property Value Surface Area, mê gm 105 Pore Volume cc gm 0.37 Density, Iblft3 Aerated 47.6 Settled 51.8 Particle Size Distribution, wt. 0 20 microns 0 20 40 microns 0 40 80 microns 22 80 microns 78 Average Particle Size, microns 86 Alumina Content, wt. 37.7 Sodium Content, wt. 0.41 X Ray Metals, wppm Cu 10 Ni 220 Fe 3330 Cr 310 V 370 Zeolite Content, wt. 7.9 parts per million by weight Illustrative porous refractory supports which may be employed in the SO removing compositions of this invention may include a gamma alumina prepared by calcining for 3 hours at 9000F 4820C the Catapal SB brand of high purity alpha alumina monohydrate marketed by ConocoChemicals Division of Continental Oil Company.The gamma alumina product is characterized as follows TABLE II Alumina content 1 wt. 75 Loss on Ignition, wt. 25 Carbon , wt. 0.3 SiO2 , wt. 0.008 Fe203 , wt. 0.005 Na2O , wt. 0.004 Sulfur , wt. 0.01 TiO2 , wt. 0.12 Crystal Structure alpha alumina monohydrate Crystal Structure gamma alumina Surface Area BET 250m2 g Pore Volume 0 100A 0.45cc gm 0 10,000A 0. 50cc gm Loose Bulk Density 49 lb ft Particle Size Distribution 48 445 microns 9 90 microns As received After calcination for 3 hrs. at 9000F 4820C . In the preferred embodiment, the additive composition of the instant invention is prepared as on alumina support separately from the FCC cracking catalyst and it is then mixed with the FCC catalyst to yield a mixture wherein the additive composition of the instant invention is 1 10 w , say 6 w of the total mixture. It is a feature of this invention that the composition contains in addition to the porous refractory support as a first component i at least one of bismuth, chromium, or a rare earth metal such as cerium and as a second component ii at least one alkali metal, preferably potassium sodium, cesium, or rubidium. Preferred compositions contain potassium and cerium or sodium and cerium. These compositions may commonly be prepared by immersing the support, typically gamma alumina of 20 200 micron particle size, in aqueous solutions of water soluble compounds of the component metals. Typical water soluble compounds may include acetates, oxalates, or nitrates of cerium and of the alkali metals e.g. sodium, potassium, or cesium. Bismuth may be added to the alumina as a 7 w solution of Bi NO3 3. 5H2O in water which has been acidified with sufficient nitric acid to form a clear solution. It is possible to add all the metals of the two components separately or in one operation. The rare earth metals include elements of atomic number 57 to 71. This group which is sometimes referred to as a lanthanide series includes lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, samarium, dysprosium, and other elements which are present in small quantities. These metals are difficultly separable from one another and may be available commercially in a mixture containing about 50 w cerium, 20 30 w lanthanum, 154 20 neodymium, 5 6 praeseodymium, and less than about 5 of the remaining rare earth elements.For purposes of the instant invention it is found that mixtures of rare earths may be employed including those commonly available which are naturally occurring mixtures which have not been separated into fractions. Although less desirable because of increased cost, available salts of increased purity of cerium or lanthanum may be employed such as cerium nitrate Ce NO3 3. 6H2O. In one preferred embodiment, it may be desirable to add the alumina support to a solution of alkali metal hydroxide and thereafter to add a solution of the nitrate of bismuth or cerium. The latter metals are precipitated as their hydroxides or oxides. The mix may then be dried, e.g. at 2120F 3000F 1000C 1400C for 1 24 hours, say 15 hours and then crushed to desired size of 50 200 microns. It may then be calcined at 13000F 15000F 7040C 8160C , say 1400OF 760at for 2 36 hours, say 24 hours. More than one metal from each group may be added e.g. Na and K plus Bi and Ce or K plus Bi and Ce it is found, however, that satisfactory i.e. improved results may be achieved by use of one metal from each group e.g.K Ce Na Ce K Bi Na Bi etc. The preferred composition contains potassium and cerium K Ce. It is preferred that the first component tprefer ably bismuth or cerium be present in the total amount of 0.5 10w , preferably 0.5w 5w , more preferably lw 3w of the support, say 3w . The second alkali metal component potassium, sodium, or cesium is preferably present in amount of 0.4 10w , preferably lw 5w , more preferably lw 3w , say 3w of the support. A preferred composition may contain 3w potassium expressed as K plus 3w cerium expressed as Ce on gamma alumina prepared from the CatapalSB alumina. The composition so prepared may in the preferred embodiment be mixed with FCC cracking catalyst and used in an FCCU wherein a sulfur containing charge hydrocarbon is cracked. Illustrative of the charge hydrocarbons may be a straight run gas oil having API gravity of 22.0 26.4 and containing 0.5 2.5 w sulfur. In operation of the FCCU, the charge hydrocarbon is heated to 8000F 12000F 4540C 5380C , say 9600F 5160C at atmospheric pressure, and admitted in vapor phase to the reaction zone a reducing zone wherein it contacts the fluidized powdered cracking catalyst composition which includes the FCC catalyst and the admixed porous refractory support bearing as a first component i at least one of bismuth, chromium, or a rare earth metal such as cerium and as a second component ii at least one alkali metal, preferably potassium, sodium, or cesium. The charge sulfur containing hydrocarbon is cracked to yield vapor containing i lighter hydrocarbons including those boiling in the motor fuel range and ii hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans.This stream is removed from the reaction zone and subjected to separation operations wherein the hydrocarbons are separated from the sulfur containing components. In the reaction zone, there is laid down on the catalyst a deposit of coke carbon in typical amount of 3.5w 5.0w , say 4.2w of the total weight of the catalyst. The catalyst also accumulates solid, sulfur containing material derived from the charge sulfur containing hydrocarbon. Typical sulfur content of the spent catalyst may be 0.03 w 0.04 w , say 0.03 w . The Spent catalyst composition bearing the sulfurcontaining coke is passed to a regeneration zone oxidation zone wherein it is contacted with oxygen containing gas oxygen enriched air or more preferably, air As regeneration proceeds at 1100eF 1500OF 5900C 815 C , say 13500F 7320C and atmospheric pressure, carbon is burned off the catalyst to form carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.When regeneration is carried out in the excess oxygen mode , the amount of air used typically 180 220, say 220 thousand lbs per hour is sufficient to produce a regenerator off gas containing 77 83 parts, say 79 parts of inert e.g. nitrogen gas, 1 7 parts, say 5 parts of oxygen, less than 1 part, of carbon monoxide, and 14 18 parts, say 16 parts of carbon dioxide. The sulfur content of the catalyst particles is also oxidized to form sulfur oxides SO principally sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide. In prior art operation wherein the catalyst composition contains only the FCC catalyst and not the additive composition of this invention , the regenerator off gas may contain 3750 5620, say 4680 w ppm sulfur dioxide and 520 780, say 650 wppm sulfur trioxide, e.g. 1800 2400 ppm v , say 2500 ppm v of sulfur dioxide and 200 300 ppm v , say 250 ppm v of sulfur trioxide. This corresponds to 4 6 , say 5 w of the sulfur which is present in the sulfur containing hydrocarbon charge. In practice of the process of this invention wherein the catalyst composition includes the FCC catalyst plus the additive composition of this invention, the regenerator off gas may contain 281 468 w ppm, say 375 w ppm sulfur dioxide and 39 65 w ppm, say 52wppm sulfur trioxide i.e. 135 225 ppm v , say 180ppm v of sulfur dioxide and 15 25ppm v of sulfur trioxide, say 20 ppm v . This corresponds to 0.3 0.5 w , say 0.4 w of the sulfur that is present in the sulfur containing hydrocarbon charge. In practice of a less preferred embodiment of this invention, the sulfur removing composition containing porous refractory support bearing as a first component i at least one of bismuth, chromium, or a rare earth metal such as cerium and as a second component ii at least one alkali metal, preferably potassium, sodium, or cesium may be absent from the FCC catalyst composition and it may be maintained in a separate bed to which the standard FCC regenerator off gases are passed and wherein the sulfur is fixed in solid form on the sulfur removing composition.When this less preferred embodiment is employed, the fluidized particles which have adsorbed the sulfur at 11000F 15000F 5950C 8150C , say 13500F 7320C are regenerated as by passing an oxygen containing gas over the catalyst at 850 F 10000F 4540C 5380C , say 9200F 4930C at atmospheric pressure. In practice of the process of this invention, much of the sulfur in the regenerator becomes fixed in solid form as sulfate, etc. on the porous refractory support bearing as a first component in at least one of bismuth, chromium, or a rare earth metal such as cerium and as a second component ii at least one alkali metal, preferably potassium, sodium, or cesium. The total sulfur content of the fluidized cracking catalyst composition including the additive may be 0.03 0.04 w , say 0.034 w as S based on total composition. This sulfur bearing regenerated catalyst composition is preferably passed to the reaction zone, wherein, under the conditions of reaction, much of the sulfur thereon is released as hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans. The overall result of this sequence of operations in the typical FCCU is that i 20 35 w , of the 2 w of the sulfur in the charge hydrocarbon is desirably released as hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans in the reaction zone overhead ii 0.3 0.5 wE, of the 2 w of the sulfur in the charge hydrocarbon is found in the regenerator off gas and iii the SOX content of the regenerator off gas is reduced to 150 250 ppm v , say 200 ppm t cf prior operations undesirably yielding 2000 3000ppm v , say 2500ppm v . Practice of the process of this invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from inspection of the following examples wherein, as elsewhere in this specification, all parts are part by weight unless otherwise stated. DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS EXAMPLE I In this example, which represents the best mode presently known of carrying out the process of this invention, the charge alpha aluminum oxide monohydrate 100 parts is Catapal SB alumina marketed by Conoco. This product is pure alumina of 50 200 micron particle size except for the following impurities TABLE Component TiO2 0.12 SiO2 0.008 Foe213 0.005 Carbon 0.36 Sulfur 0.01 Na2O plus all alkali metals 0.004 Water is added to this charge gamma alumina 100 parts to form a paste. There is added thereto with mixing a solution of 4.30 parts of potassium hydroxide in 50 parts of water.A solution containing 50 parts of water and 9.28 parts of cerium nitrate Ce NO3 3. 6H2O is added to the potassium containing alumina, mixing well. The mix is dried at 185 F 2300F 850C 1100C for 15 24 hours and then calcined at 1400OF 7600C for 24 hours. Analysis showed that the composition contained alumina, 3w potassium, and 3w cerium, the latter two percentages based on the alumina.It was then pulverized to 50 200 micron size and mixed with nine times its weight of commercial equilibrium cracking catalyst Davison CBZ 1 brand catalyst containing originally 15wZ rare earth exchanged Y zeolite plus 85w silica alumina. This catalyst composition is evaluated for its SOx emission reduction capacity in a micro activity tester which simulates FCC conditions including the following TABLE Condition Value Reaction Zone Average Temperature OF 960 C 516 Reaction Time . min 10 Catalyst Inventory g 10 Pressure atmospheric Nitrogen Flow rate ml min 175 Catalyst oil wt ratio 3.0Regeneration Zone Complete coke combustion mode Air Flow ml min 175 Average Temperature OF Ca 1300 C 705 Regeneration Time min 15 The charge to the reaction zone, in vapor phase at 9200F 4730C , is a synthetic gas oil containing 2 w sulfur having the following composition TABLE Property .

The results are tabulated in the Table followingExample IX.

The material tested in controlExample VIII is Catapal SB alumina alone and in controlExample IX , the material tested is the equilibrium DavisonCBZ 1 Brand catalyst. The results are as follows TABLE Example Agent SO I 3 R 3 Ce A1203 0.43 29 II 3 Na 3 ce Al2o3 0.48 26 III 3 K 3 Bi A1203 0.57 26 IV 3 Na A1203 0.86 25 V 3 Na 3 Bi Al2O3 0.95 26 VI 4sBi A1203 1.1 27 VII 3 R A1203 0.85 27 VIII A12 3 2.4 29 IX Eq. Davison CBZ 1 4.5 28 Control Examples SO includes sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide in the regenerator off gas, reported as w of the sulfur content of the sulfur containing hydrocarbon charge. H2S includes hydrogen sulfide plus mercaptans in the reactor off gas, reported as w of the sulfur content of the charge sulfur containing hydrocarbon charge. SO concentrations are generally measurable to within an experimental error of 0.1 and the concentrations noted in Examples IV, V, and VII differ by non significant differences. From the above Table, it will be apparent that the following conclusions may be drawn i the compositions of this invention Ex I III and V permit attainment of regenerator off gas containing less than lw SOx which is substantially better than that obtained e.g. by use of pure alumina Ex VIII or catalyst alone Ex IX ii the most satisfactory results achieved Ex I by use of the preferred composition of this invention are two i.e. 0.86 0.43 times better than the best control example Ex IV , íii the results achieved by use of this invention Ex I may be more than ten times 4.5 0.43 better than are attained by use of equilibrium Davison CBZ 1 catalyst etc. EXAMPLES X XI The catalyst composition of Example I and one similar to Example IV but containing 2w Na A1203 both in combination with CBZ 1 were subjected to stability tests, by exposing the mixture to water saturated laboratory air for prolonged times at 13500F. In the case of control Example X , the 2w Na Al2O3 composition, the SO content of regenerator off gas was about 0.74 at day 1 and increased up to about 2.08 at day 6. In contrast, for experimental Example XI using the catalyst of Example I, the 3 k 3 Ce A1203 composition , the SO content was about 0.18 at day 1 and increased only x to about 0.4 at day 8 Results comparable to those attained by Example I may be attained if the catalyst composition contains the following in addition to the 3 w potassium as the first component TABLE Example Composition XII 3 w Bi 3 w Ce on alumina XIII 3 w Cr 3 w Ce on alumina EXAMPLE XIV XV In this pair of comparative examples, FCC operations were carried out using an Isthmus vacuum gas oil containing 1.44 w sulfur utilizing a reactor temperature of 9600F and a regenerator temperature of 13500F. In control Example XIV, the catalyst contained theDavison CBZ 1 brand of commercial catalyst. In experimentalExample XV, the catalyst contained 3 w of additive containing 3 w potassium and 3 wZ cerium on gamma alumina. Using the control system, the 50x content of the regenerator off gas averaged 854 wppm. Using the experimental system, the SO content of the regenerator off gas averaged 566 wppm an improvement of 34 . Although this invention has been illustrated by reference to specific embodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be which clearly fall within the scope of this invention.
