## Description
The invention relates to type recording and or reproducing apparatus, particularly but not exclusively a compact 8 mm VTR with a built in camera, wherein a tape drawn from a tape cassette is wound around a rotary head drum to perform a recording thereon or reproducing therefrom. In previously proposed cassette type VTRs, a tape cassette is mounted on a chassis in such a way that a pair of tape reels are engaged with a pair of reel discs, respectively and then a tape is drawn from the tape cassette by tape loading means to wind the tape around a rotary head drum and, thereafter, a recording or reproducing takes place by the rotary head drum while the tape moves at constant speed along its running path. That is, the tape cassette must be located on the chassis at some distance from the rotary head drum so that the tape cassette or the tape in the tape cassette does not unexpectedly come into contact with a rotary drum located at the top of the rotary head drum. However, to place the tape cassette at a sufficient distance from the rotary head drum, prevents the VTR from being made compact. In order to make the VTR compact, it is therefore, important to diminish the distance between the tape cassette and the rotary head drum. In order to overcome such a problem, it has been proposed to move the rotary head drum so as to bring it near the tape cassette after the tape cassette is installed on the chassis. Thus Patent Specification WO A 8403720 discloses a cassette tape recorder wherein a cassette mounting part is relatively movable with respect to a part mounting a rotary head drum so that during recording or reproducing the drum is advanced into an opening in the tape cassette to reduce the overall size of the recorder. However the rotary head drum is such an important component of the VTR as to be made with considerable accuracy of the order of a few microns. Therefore, if such a constitution is adopted in a practical VTR, unstable factors in tape running are enhanced, and recording and or reproducing precisions are degraded. Hence, the idea mentioned above has not been widely applied to practical VTRs. According to the invention there is provided a tape loading device for cassette type tape recording and or reproducing apparatus comprising Such a construction makes it possible to diminish the distance between the rotary head drum and the tape cassette mounted on the chassis, while maintaining stable tape running and high recording or reproducing precision, in a compact VTR. Thus the tape loading device comprises a fixed chassis on which the rotary head drum is mounted, and a slidable chassis on which the pair of reel discs are mounted, the slidable chassis being slidably mounted on the fixed chassis so that the pair of reel discs can be moved to approach or separate from the rotary head drum after a tape cassette is installed on the movable chassis and the pair of tape reels therein are engaged with the pair of reel discs, the tape cassette being moved by means of the slidable chassis toward the rotary head drum and a tape in the tape cassette being wound around the rotary head drum by a tape loading means. The tape cassette can thus be placed at a sufficient distance at first from a rotary head drum, so that the tape cassette or the tape therein does not come in contact with the rotary head drum and they are not damaged by each other. Thus the rotary head drum is immovable and, instead, the pair of reel discs and the tape cassette mounted thereon are moved toward the rotary head drum by the slidable chassis. The distance between the tape cassette and rotary head drum can be greatly decreased during normal operation, despite maintaining high tape running stability and high recording and reproducing precision. Therefore, the total size of the cassette type recording and or reproducing apparatus can be reduced as much as or more than that of conventional apparatus. In addition, since tape loading means, which are provided on a slidable chassis and are moved integrally therewith, are guided by the guide rails while the tape cassette is moved by the slidable chassis, positioning of the tape loading means with respect to the moving tape cassette can be accurately defined, and a length of the guide rail can be greatly decreased. Therefore, when the tape cassette is mounted on the slidable chassis, the tape in the tape cassette will no longer be damaged due to interference of the tape loading means or due to a unnecessary withdrawal force of the tape loading means. Preferably, the first guide rails on the slidable chassis are formed of a synthetic resin and the tape loading means can be moved smoothly along the first guide rails with a small torque, thus rendering a motor for driving the tape loading means compact in size. The invention is diagrammatically illustrated by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which An 8 mm VTR includes, as illustrated in Figure 6, a slidable chassis 1 formed of a metal plate, such as stainless steel plate, and reinforced by a plurality of ribs 2 formed by bent over peripheries of the metal plate, thereby to obtain a plate which has highly precise flat surfaces. A pair of reel discs, particularly a supply reel disc 3 Referring to Figures 6 to 9, a pair of first guide rails 9 A pair of upper and lower pawls 14 Referring to Figures 1 to 5, a drive mechanism 80 for driving the slidable chassis and the tape loading means has a fixed chassis 17 formed of metal, such as aluminum. Mounted on the upper front end portion of the fixed chassis 17 by way of a drum base 19 is a rotary head drum 18, upper and the lower drums 18 A partially toothed gear 21 is rotatably supported on the upper portion of the fixed chassis 17, and a pin 22 is eccentrically secured on the gear 21 as shown in Figure 5. A guide plate 24 with a guide slot 23, into which the drive pin 22 is inserted from below, is fixed to the lower surface of the slidable chassis 1 with a plurality of screws 25. The guide slot 23 comprises a linear part 23 A drive mechanism 81 for moving the tape loading means 27a and 27b has the following arrangement. Each of the tape loading means 27a and 27b has a vertical roller guide 29, which comprises a roller, and an inclined guide 30, which comprises a fixed pin, and they are mounted on a movable block 28. As shown in Figures 7 to 9, a pair of guide pins 31 A pair of drive plates 32 Rotatably supported on the upper portion of the fixed chassis 17 are a pair of gears 37 As shown in Figures 7 to 9, one of the guide pins 31 As shown in Figures 1, 2 and 5, or Figures 7 to 9, second guide rail means in the form of a pair of positioning stands 46 As shown in Figure 6, a tension detecting pin 51 is pivotally mounted on the front end portion of one side of the slidable chassis 1 through an arm 52 and a pivot 53. A tape drawing pin 54 and a pinch roller 55 are pivotally mounted on the front end portion of the other side of the slidable chassis 1 through respective arms 57 and 56 and respective pivots 59 and 58. The tension detecting pin 51 is connected to a hand brake 60 which is mounted on the slidable chassis 1 to adjust a brake force of the supply reel disc 3 As shown in Figures 1 and 2, a capstan 62 and an impedance roller 63 are rotatably mounted on the fixed chassis 17 at the respective right and left sides of the rotary head drum 18. A reel disc driving mechanism 64 is mounted on the fixed chassis 17 in the intermediate position between the reel disc 3 As shown in Figures 1 and 2, a tape magnetic tape 73 wound around a supply reel 72 Tape loading and tape unloading operations will now be explained with reference to Figures 1 to 9. Before the cassette 71 is installed, the slidable chassis 1 is moved in the direction of arrow In this state, as shown in Figure 3, when the tape cassette 71 is installed on the slidable chassis 1 by a cassette mounting device not shown and supported on the two cassette positioning pins 6 and the two cassette mounting bases 7, the tape loading means 27 Under the above mentioned state, the tape cassette 71 is so placed on the slidable chassis 1 as to have the tape 73 thereof sufficiently separated by a distance ℓ₂ The tape loading operation is performed by driving the drive motor 39 in the normal direction after the cassette 71 is installed. That is, when the motor 39 is rotated in the normal direction, the gears 37 While the pin 22 rotates from the inactive position indicated by chain dotted lines to an intermediate position indicated by dotted lines in Figure 5 by an angle ϑ₃ The reel discs 3 The first guide rails 9 Meanwhile, as the slidable chassis 1 is moved in the direction of arrow The tape 73 in the tape cassette 71 is drawn from the front opening 75 by the vertical roller guides 29 of the tape loading means 27 During this operation, the swing gear 66 of the reel disc driving mechanism 64 is positioned in an intermediate position between the gears 69 After completion of the tape loading operation, the tape 73 is pressed against the capstan 62 by the pinch roller 55 as shown in Figure 2 and run under constant speed along the loading path, so that the tape 73 is paid out from the supply reel 72 In the meantime, the unloading operation of the tape is conducted by the motor 39 being rotated in the reverse direction, in other words, through almost reversing the above mentioned loading operation of the tape, but until the tape loading means 27 The tape cassette 71 is moved together with the reel discs 3 The present invention is not limited to an 8 mm VTR with a built in camera, but can be applied to various other cassette type recording and or reproducing apparatus.
