# IMAGEABLE VAPOR DEPOSITED COLORANT LAYERS

## Abstract
Vapor deposited colorant layers can be used to provide optical density in photoresist imaging articles. The use of organic materials containing carbonyl groups which are not part of carboxyl groups , phenoxy groups, ester groups, or alcohol groups over vapor deposited metal layers improves their mar resistance. These organic materials can improve the properties of the metal layer when used in photoresist imaging films.
