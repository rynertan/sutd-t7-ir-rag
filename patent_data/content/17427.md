# Time delay device and piece of equipment used in combination with such a device.

## Abstract
A time delay device is adapted to cooperate with a firing device. The time delay device comprises a piston 30 for cooperating with the firing device, a spring 34 to move the piston 30 between a first position in which the firing device remains in a non operating condition and a second position in which said firing device is allowed to operate, a retractable pin 35 to hold the piston in the first position, a reservoir 42 of fluid adapted to be acted upon by the piston 30 and communicating with a length of small bore or micro bore tubing 41 whereby upon movement of the piston 30 fluid will be displaced from the reservoir 42 through said tubing 41 , with the rate of movement of the piston 30 , and therefore the time for the piston 30 to move from the first to the second position under the action of said spring 34 , being dictated by the viscosity of the fluid in the reservoir 42 and the length of the tubing 41 . A predetermined time delay is therefore produced between actuation by retractiong of the pin 35 and movement of the piston 30 under the action of said spring 34 to the second position to allow operation of the firing device. A temperature compensating device 52 is also disclosed.
