# A raster display system.

## Abstract
In a computer generated imagery system for producing raster scanned pictures on a display screen, equations defining edges for surface to be depicted in the pictures are calculated at 29L, 29M and 29N. A signal at 29E represents the x and y co ordinates of a particular point on the raster spot which has finite dimensions and when these co ordinates satisfy an equation defined at 29L, 29M or 29N the colour and brightness of the spots are changed according to information entering at 29I, 29P and 29S this information defining required visual characteristics of the picture. The required colour and brightness values are defined by the two outputs of 29R. In order to avoid the production of a stepped edge on the picture when it is required to depict a sloping line the circuitry at 29A is duplicated at 29B, again at 29C and again at 29D. The circuits 29A, B, C and D all receive x and y co ordinates of points at different heights on the raster spot so that they calculate colour and brightness changes to occur at slightly different times when the raster is crossing a sloping line. This time difference depends on the degree of slope and is zero for a vertical line. By averaging the brightness and colour values in circuitry 29T, 29U, 29V and 29W a smoothing effect is obtained thereby eliminating the aforementioned stepped edges without unnecessary loss of detail.
