# Actuation system for a control surface of an aircraft.

## Abstract
An actuation system for rotating a control surface mounted on an aircraft airfoil 12 , the control surface 16 being rotatable about a first axis 20 at an acute angle to the longitudinal axis 14 of the aircraft is disclosed. The invention comprises a first crank 38 having a first end 36 and a second end 40 pivotally mounted to the airfoil 12 and rotatable about a spanwise second axis 44 substantial ly perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 14 of the aircraft. A second crank 50 is pivotally mounted at its first end to the first crank 38 and is rotatable about a third axis 52 which is substantially perpendicular to the second axis. The second end 54 of the second crank 50 is pivotally mounted to the control surface 16 . The second end 54 of the second crank 50 is rotatable about a fourth axis 66 substantially perpendicular to said second and third axes 44 and 52 , respectively. An actuator 30 , substantially aligned with the longitudinal axis 14 of the aircraft 10 , is coupled to the airfoil 12 and to the first end 36 of the first crank 38 . Thus, upon extension or retraction of the actuator 30 in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis 14 of the aircraft 10 the first and second cranks 38 and 50 respectively rotate about the second axis 52 , causing the control surface 16 to rotate about the first axis 44 , and further to rotate relative to each other to accommodate the motion of the second end 54 of the second crank 50 in a plane perpendicular to the first axis 20 caused by its attachment to the control surface 16 .
