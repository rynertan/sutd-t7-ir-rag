# Polyester fibers.

## Abstract
A paper making polyester fibre having a dernier number within the range of from 0.1 to 3.0 and a length within the range of from 5 to 25 mm shows good water dispersibility and permits improved handling efficiency in packing operations using, e.g. a box type staple baling machine due to a reduced degree of smoothness. These fibre properties are expressed by a quantity of resid ual fibres of less than 1000 mg on a flat screen 34 plate when measured by a flat screen method and a packing factor of more than 40, and may be obtained by treating the fibres with a spe cific copolyester composition.
