# Offshore tower structures.

## Abstract
The invention provides an offshore tower structure comprising a base structure for positioning on the sea bed, a central enclosed tubular column 20 containing services such as conductors and risers and extending from the base structure to above the water level, in use, for supporting a service platform 21 and at least three tubular support legs 22, 23, 24 each extending between the base structure at a point spaced apart from the column and an upper portion of the tubular column, the support legs each being rigidly attach able to the base structure and to the column and the base structure providing means for maintaining the spacing between the support legs and the column, in which each support leg is attached to the column by welding and there is means to provide a water tight compartment around the joint from which water can be removed so that the leg can be welded to the column in dry surroundings.
