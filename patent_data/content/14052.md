# Catalyst for the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide, processes for its preparation, and its use.

## Abstract
A catalytic material for the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide at a temperature above 300 C., comprises a catalyst which at reaction conditions is a melt dispersed in an inert porous carrier, the catalyst including sulfatized vanadium ions as the active catalytic component, and two different promoters, the first of which comprises cesium ions, optionally with ions of another alkali metal such as sodium, potassium or rubidium, known to promote vana dium catalysts. The second promoter comprises ions of a metal such as aluminum, magnesium, yttrium or lanthanum, which does not promote formation of inactive V‚Å¥ species and the oxide of which has a heat of formation greater than 100 kcal per oxygen atom and is at least partly solu ble in the heavily sulfatized environment of the melt. Its presence results in a significant increase in activity of the catalytic material compared with material containing only the first promoter.
