# LENTICULAR OPTICAL CONE

## Abstract
Conical lenses of inharmonious, nonparallel surfaces, called lenticular cones, are described. Such cones have two conical surfaces, one concave and the other convex, and their sides are formed by respective cones of different openings. The cone walls are of variable thickness, and can be thinnest near the vertex of the cone, increasing in thickness to a maximum at the base of the cone, or thickest at the vertex of the cone and decreasing in thickness to a minimum at the base of said cone. Optical objectives formed by lenticular optical cones and or conical lenses are also described.
