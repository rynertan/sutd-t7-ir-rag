# Detecting leaks.

## Abstract
The leak detector comprises an annular chamber 11 which leads to a circumferential orifice 14 which in turn leads to an annular duct 21 which is symmetrical about the axis of the detector. Barrier gas is fed to the annular chamber 11 , for example from an annular chamber 18 and emerges from the opening 20 to form a substantially laminar flow. Leaks are detected by means of a signal gas within an enclosure at a pressure slightly in excess of ambient, and the signal gas is detected from leaks via a probe 2 which is connected for example to a mass spectrometer. The curtain 1 is stable and enables uneven surfaces to be tracked.
