# MAGNETIC TRANSDUCER MEANS FOR MEASURING FORCE, IN PARTICULAR THE TRACTION RESISTANCE OF AN AGRICULTURAL TRACTOR.

## Abstract
A tubular flexural bar 15 , consisting of magnetic material, contains an iron core 23 of magnetically soft material, on opposing limbs of which are wound a pair of exciting coils 27,28 . The shaped corners of the iron core 23 make good magnetic contact with the inner surface of the flexural bar 15 . Magnetic flux is induced by the coil excitation in three parts, the first two producing flux which passes through two paths in the flexural bar, whilst a third flux circulates around the core and through the air gap 25 to be detected by a Hall element 26 . When the flexual bar 15 is loaded, its reluctance changes and the first fluxes become unequal, changing the gap flux with a resulting signal from the element 26 being related to the distorting force applied to the flexural bar 15 .
