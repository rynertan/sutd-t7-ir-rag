# PORTAL FRAME STRUCTURES

## Abstract
A portal frame structure is provided comprising a horizontal truss 10 and vertical supports 11, 12 se cured to the respective ends of the truss 10 , the truss 10 being provided with a joint arrangement 13 inter mediate its end, said joint arrangement 13 being such that outside elements 15, 16 of the truss 10 on one side of its neutral axis X X are maintained in com pression in both directions of load on the truss, and that outside truss elements 18, 19 on the other side of said neutral access are subjected to predetermined tension, such that as the load increases in one of said load directions the tension is reduced, and to tension exerted in the other of said load directions. The pre determined tension may be zero, such that the joint arrangement collapses immediately a compressive load is applied. Alternatively, it may have a value such that it reaches zero at any point up to the maximum designed load for a particular building application. The portal frames are for use with cladding secured to the inner side of the frames.
