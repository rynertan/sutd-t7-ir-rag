## Description
The present invention relates to a monolithic optical memory semiconductor laser apparatus in which a recording semiconductor laser device and a replaying semiconductor laser device are incorporated into a single body. Such a device is disclosed in JP A 60 107886. There are optical disc filing apparatus, etc., in which as soon as image information is recorded on an optical disc by a recording semiconductor laser device, it is replayed by a replaying semiconductor laser device and if it is recognized that the image information contains errors, a corrected form is re recorded on the next track of the optical disc. When a recording semiconductor laser device and a replaying semiconductor laser device are monolithically integrated on a single semiconductor substrate, a single optic can be shared for the recording and replaying operations, making the optical disc filing apparatus extremely simple. Generally, it is necessary for a recording semiconductor laser device to produce as high an output power as possible. In order to prevent deterioration of the recording semiconductor laser device in the production of a high output power, the light emitting face of the laser device is covered with a protective film such as alumina Al₂O₃ film, etc., having a thickness of 1 4 λ wherein λ is the wavelength of laser light from the laser device . Since the recording semiconductor laser device and the replaying semiconductor laser device are monolithically formed on a single semiconductor substrate, when the above mentioned protective film is formed on the recording semiconductor laser device, the formation of the protective film on the replaying semiconductor laser device is unavoidable, which causes reflected light from the optical disc, etc., to strike the replaying semiconductor laser device. Due to such reflected light, the resonance frequency wherein τ Given that the reflection index In order to solve the above mentioned problem, it is conceivable to mask the light emitting face of the replaying semiconductor laser device when the above mentioned protective film is formed on the light emitting face of the recording semiconductor laser device. However, such a process is not practical because extremely precise processing is required which makes production cost significantly high. In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an optical memory semiconductor laser apparatus incorporating a recording semiconductor laser device for an optical memory and a replaying semiconductor laser device for an optical memory, therein into a single body, whereby both said recording semiconductor laser device and said replaying semiconductor laser device are of a VSIS laser device comprising a semiconductor substrate with a V channel that is formed through a current blocking layer, the width of the V channel of said replaying semiconductor laser device being smaller than that of the V channel of said recording semiconductor laser device, and that the oscillation threshold current of said replaying semiconductor laser device is smaller than that of said recording semiconductor laser device. In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an optical memory semiconductor laser apparatus comprising a semiconductor substrate, a current blocking layer disposed on said substrate, first and second V channels formed in a parallel manner through said current blocking layer and in said substrate, a cladding layer disposed on said current blocking layer and filling said V channels, an active layer formed above said cladding layer, wherein said first and second V channels function as first and second optical waveguides within said active layer, respectively, wherein said first and second optical waveguides respectively constitute recording and replaying semiconductor laser devices, the width of said second V channel being smaller than that of said first V channel, and the oscillation threshold current of said replaying semiconductor laser device is smaller than that of said recording semiconductor laser device. Thus, the invention described herein makes possible the objects of 1 providing a monolithic semiconductor laser apparatus in which the oscillation threshold current of the replaying semiconductor laser device is smaller than that of the recording semiconductor laser device to thereby heighten the resonance frequency By way of example only, a specific embodiment of the present invention will now be described, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figures 1 and 2 show a monolithic semiconductor laser apparatus 1 of this invention, in which a V channelled substrate inner stripe VSIS recording semiconductor laser device 21 and a VSIS replaying semiconductor laser device 22 are incorporated on a semiconductor substrate The production process of this apparatus is as follows An n GaAs current blocking layer The width As mentioned above, the width W₂ 3 µm of the stripe consisting of the cavity portion of the replaying semiconductor laser device 22 is smaller than the width W₁ 5 µm of the stripe consisting of the cavity portion of the recording semiconductor laser device 21, so that the resonance frequency f₀ of the relaxation oscillation of the replaying semiconductor laser device 22 can be increased, and suppression of the relative intensity noise RIN can be attained as indicated by the operation characteristic curve shown in Figure 3 in which the RIN is about 1 x 10 ¹¹ Hz ¹ at the highest. Since the optical memory semiconductor laser apparatus is designed, as mentioned above, such that the oscillation threshold current of the replaying semiconductor laser device is smaller than that of the recording semiconductor laser device, although a protective film such as an alumina film, etc., is formed not only on the light emitting face of the recording semiconductor laser device, but also on the light emitting face of the replaying semiconductor laser device, the lowering of the oscillation frequency during the operation of the replaying semiconductor laser device due to the said protective film thereon can be compensated.
