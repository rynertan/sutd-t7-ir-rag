# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO TRANSPORTING SYSTEMS FOR ROBOTS

## Abstract
A transporting system for a robot comprises a self propelled wheeled platform 10 which travels along a pair of tracks 12 which establish a path between a series of spaced work stations. Accurate positioning of the platform at the work stations is achieved by a toggle operated 32 to 46 platform mounted mechanism which lifts the platform 10 above the track 12 , using four precisely positioned locator blocks 22, 24, 26 fixed to the tracks 12 at each work station. These blocks provide a reaction and reference surface for the lifting mechanism and have formations 64 or 70 which co operate with formations 66 or 72 on the carriage to cam the carriage into the desired longitudinal and transverse position as the car riage is lifted. The lifting mechanism also functions to fixedly clamp the carriage to the locator blocks once the final position has been achieved. Alternative embodiments permit precise elevational and lateral positioning at predetermined elongated positions along the track, while loosely gripping the elongated locator blocks, thereby permitting the robot to perform opera tions as it moves along the track, while still being precisely positioned and stabilized against overturning tendencies.
