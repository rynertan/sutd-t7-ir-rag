# The use of polymeric alkylenephosphoric acid piperazine derivatives as set retarding compounds for use in cement slurries.

## Abstract
Polymers which are the reaction product of N aminoethylpiperazine and a dihalo or epoxy halo compound are subsequently phosphonomethylated to provide products which are useful as cement set retarders.
