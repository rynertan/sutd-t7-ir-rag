# ORGANOPOLYSILOXANE COMPOUNDS CONTAINING SIC BONDED ALKOXORGANOPOLYSILOXANE COMPOUNDS CONTAINING SIC BONDED ALKOXYSILYLALKYL AND POLYOXYALKYLENE RADICALS YSILYLALKYL AND POLYOXYALKYLENE RADICALS

## Abstract
Organopolysiloxane compounds having both alkoxysily lalkyl radicals and polyoxyalkylene radicals are prepared so that the compounds have a substantially linear structure and at least one of the terminating radicals of the polysiloxane is either an alkoxysilylalkyl radical or a polyoxyalkylene radical. The compounds are particularly useful as a treating agent for conferring hydrophilic properties to a solid substrate.
