# COMPILER FOR A SOURCE PROGRAM, A METHOD OF MAKING THE SAME AND ITS USE

## Abstract
A table driven attribute parser for checking the consisten cy and completeness of attribute assignments in a source program is generated by expressing the syntax rules, seman tic restrictions and default assignments as a single context free grammar compatible with a grammar processor, or parser generator, and processing the context free grammar to generate an attribute parser including a syntax table and a parse driver. The table driven attribute parser is incorporated into a compiler.
