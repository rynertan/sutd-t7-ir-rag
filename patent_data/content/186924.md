# POLYCRYSTALLINE X RAY SPECTROMETER

## Abstract
A wavelength dispersive X ray spectrometer is provid ed with a polycrystalline analyzer for analyzing characteris tic spectra of a sample. The polycrystalline analyzer pro vides a multiple spectrum of characteristic lines which are separated by appropriate pulse height analysis. Each of these sets of characteristic lines of the elements of the sam ple are provided at different dispersion and wavelenght ranges.
