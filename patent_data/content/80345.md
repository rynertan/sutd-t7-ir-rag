# Glass ceramic coatings for use on metal substrates.

## Abstract
A glass ceramic characterised in that it is capable of being fired repeatedly to temperatures of greater than 950 C with out undergoing thermal deformation, it exhibits a coefficient of thermal expansion 25 600 C of from 75 to 150 x 10 ⁷ C , it is essentially free from alkali metal oxides and it comprises expressed in terms of weight percent on the oxide basis from 10 to 60 BaO, from 5 to 30 B₂O₃, from 25 to 40 SiO₂,from 0 to 15 Al₂O₃, from 0 to 15 CaO, from 10 to 35 MgO, from 0 to 16 ZnO and from 5 to 20 Al ₂O₃ CaO ZnO is disclosed. More particular, the present invention relates to such a glass ceramic in the from of a coating on a substrate, for exam ple on a low carbon or titanium stabilized stainless steel. In the case of the glass ceramic in the form of a coating, a process for the production thereof characterised in that it comprises a melting an appropriate batch b cooling the melt to a glass and comminuting the glass to fine particles passing a No. 325 United States Standard Sieve 44 x 10 m c preparing a liquid slurry of the glass particles d applying the slurry as a coating onto a desired sub strate and e firing the coating to a temperature of at least 850 C substantially simultaneously to sinter the glass particles to gether into an integral, essentially non porous coating and to cause extensive crystallization in situ to take place therein is also disclosed. Inter alia, the present materials have improved properties as regards the use thereof in the construction of circuit boards.
