# A microinstruction control storage system.

## Abstract
A microinstruction control storage mechanism includes an addressable read only store and an addressable writeable control store which includes an address mechanism for the transfer, or paging, of blocks of microinstructions from a reserved portion of main storage to the writeable control store as required during data processing. The mechanism also includes means for identifying erroneous microinstruc tions accessed from the read only store and provides a substitute microinstruction address identifying a small num ber of main store addresses reserved for substitute microin structions which is then presented to the addressing mechanism of the writeable control store for transfer of substitute microinstructions to the writeable control store. The main store address generated by the address substitu tion mechanism is a function of several microinstruction addresses associated with the read only store. The substitute address identifying a main store location accesses a microin struction utilized to identify a particular one of several possible erroneous microinstructions, to thereafter access a particular substitute microinstruction for correcting the ori ginal erroneous microinstruction.

## Description
MICROCODE CONTROL OF MICROINSTRUCTION SUBSTITUTIONIN A CONTROL STORE MECHANISMThe present invention relates to a microprogram control store element CSE in a data processing system, and more particularly to a CSE comprised of a read only store ROS and a writeable control store WCS , dynamically changed during data processing by transfer of microcode from main storage to the WCS, and wherein the WCS is utilized to provide a substitute microinstruction for a known erroneous microinstruction accessed from theROS.The following U.S. patents, all assigned to the assignee of the present invention, disclose various elements of a control store mechanism utilizing the present invention 1. U. S. Patent 3,800,293 issued March 26, 1974, entitled Microprogram Control Sub System by T. A. Enger et al. 2. U. S. Patent 3,958,227 issued May 18, 1976, entitled Control Store System With Flexible Control Word Selection by C. W. Evans. 3. U. S. Patent 3,976,865 issued August 24, 1976, entitled Error Detector For An Associative Directory Or Translator by T. A. Enger. 4. U. S. Patent 4,008,460 issued February 15, 1977, entitled Circuit For Implementing A Modified LRU Replacement Algorithm For A Cache by L. R. Bryant et al.In stored program data processing systems, two techniques for control of the data processing system are normally implemented. One involves the design of hardwired sequencers, and the other involves the design of a control store element CSE comprised of storage devices for storing sequences of micro instructions making up microprograms. In either case, machine instructions transferred from main storage to the central processing unit will be interpreted to deter mine the coding of an operation code portion of the instruction to determine the function to be performed such as Add, Subtract,Multiply, etc. When a CSE is utilized, the operation code will normally be utilized to address a storage device to access the first micro instruction of a microprogram effective to execute the function called for by the operation code.An excellent discussion of the various forms that aCSE can take is found in an article entitled Micro programming Perspective and Status by A. J. Agrawala and T. G. Rauscher, IEEE Transactions On Computers,Volume C 23, No. 8, August 1974, Page 817. One form of CSE includes at least two types of storage devices utilized for storing sequences of microinstructions making up microprograms. One type of storage device is a read only store ROS , and the other is a writeable control store WCS . The ROS will be comprised of binary bit patterns which make up addressable microinstructions and which, during operation of the data processing system, will never be altered. In some data processing systems, the ROS may in fact be a permanently configured storage device created during manufacture of the data processing system.Another form of ROS would be a volatile storage device in which information can be stored, as necessary, but once initialized or loaded with microinstructions, will thereafter not be modified during processing functions. On the other hand, a WCS will be an addressable storage device of the read write type wherein microinstructions can be dynamically stored into the storage device and thereafter read or accessed for use, and would be dynamically changed as conditions required during data processing.Examples of this type of CSE configuration are represented by U. S. Patents 3,478,322 and 3,735,363. Contempory data processing systems which include a CSE, also include a central processing unit and a main storage device for the storage of data and programs to be executed by the system. Also included is a processor controller, or console, which provides basic control for the entire system. It is the function of the processor controller, when power is turned on to the data processing system, to load necessary information into the data processing system. The main storage device has a portion reserved for a number of system control data blocks, including all of the microprograms required to operate the system.This reserved portion of main storage is not addressable by program instructions executed by the system, but is primarily addressable by the central processing unit under control of microinstructions. To initialize the data processor, the processor controller will transfer all of the microcode, and other control information required by the system, to the reserved portion of main storage. By utilizing special data paths, the processor controller has the ability to store prespecified information into various registers, triggers, or storage arrays within the central processing unit, including the ROS of the CSE, if theROS is a read write type of storage device. If theROS is a permanent storage device this would not be required.When a WCS is provided, this may be initialized by the processor controller or, as a minimum, the processor controller will store all of the microcode that may be utilized in the WCS into the main storage device. The use of ROS in a CSE is normally for frequently used microcode. Its construction is such that it is very dense and high speed, but is relatively expensive when compared with a WCS. As the design of a data processing system progresses, a point will be reached where all of the microprograms have been written for the frequent processing functions required. A ROS storage device will be manufactured with the permanent bit patterns required to provide the necessary sequence of microinstructions. It is frequently discovered during the data processing system design, or after design has been completed, that certain of the previously created microinstructions in the ROS are erroneous.Another error situation that can occur with the ROS, even after the entire data processing system has been designed and erroneous microinstructions corrected, is that the hardware mechanism of the ROS may develop a failure which is permanent. Also, the creation of microcode that is permanently stored in a ROS is initially dictated by known features, functions and instructions to be executed when the data processing system is designed. New features, changing functions, or newly defined program instructions requiring modifications to the bit patterns of a ROS would require a long and expensive procedure, and systems already in use could not be modified easily. So it is an object of the present invention to provide microcode assisted corrective action in a CSE which is unknown to a user or the remainder of the data processing system, except for a time lapse and in a CSE for a faulty microinstruction read from a ROS utilizing apparatus normally used for transfer of microcode, as needed, from the main store of a data processing system to aWCS.This object of the invention is solved by the features of claim 1.Further features and advantageous embodiments are characterized in the further claims.These advantages of the invention are realized in a data processing system that includes a main storage device, central processing unit, processor controller, and control storage element CSE . The CSE includes, for the storage of microinstructions, a read only store ROS and a writeable control store WCS . The ROS contains a predetermined number of addressable microinstructions. The WCS functions essentially like a high speed buffer, or cache, found between the main store and the CPU of many data pro cessing systems.That is, the WCS contains a small number of microin structions of all of the micro instructions which can be stored in the area reserved in the main store for microcode. The WCS is a fully associative storage device which includes an address directory for identifying and locating microinstructions in the WCS by using the main store address utilized for accessing the main store for the transfer of a group of microinstructions to the WCS. Since the WCS has a limited capacity, a least recently used LRU replacement algorithm is implemented. As new micro instructions are transferred from main store to the WCS, the replacement algorithm identifies the portion of the WCS to be replaced by the new group of micro instructions. The WCS functions in accordance with the teachings of the above identified references 3 and 4.The dynamic, as needed, transfer of groups of micro instructions from main storage to theWCS is similar to data transfer between I O devices and main storage, and is called paging . Therefore, the use of the WCS in this fashion prompts a re naming to pageable control store PCS . The subject invention utilizes the previously defined mechanism to provide corrective action for errors in theCSE. The invention includes a storage device known as a halt array and an address substitution mechanism comprised of two storage arrays. The halt array includes a single bit position associated with each microinstruction that can be addressed in the ROS. As errors are noted in the operation of particular microinstructions read from ROS, maintenance personnel will provide necessary information in the processor controller to cause the associated bit position of the halt array to be changed to a binary 1 The halt array is accessed with the same microinstruction address utilized to access the ROS.When the corresponding bit position is read out and detected as a binary 1, the execution of the faulty microinstruction is prevented. In response to the halt signal from the halt array, the address of the faulty microinstruction in ROS is utilized in an address substitution mechanism which provides an address translation function to address the location in main storage of the microinstruction to be substituted for the faulty microinstruction. When the address substitution mechanism has provided the main store address, the previously definedPCS address directory and transfer mechanism is utilized to cause the substitute microinstruction to be accessed from PCS to provide correct operation for that microinstruction cycle. If the directory indicates a match, PCS already contains the substitute microinstruction and will be immediately accessed. A miss in the directory will initiate a transfer from main storage. Normal processing will resume after the substitute microinstruction has been executed. Maintenance personnel using the processor controller mechanism specify substitute main store addresses which provides the ability to compress the amount of main storage addresses required to identify a particular substitute microinstruction for only the faulty microinstructions addressed from ROS. When the system is initialized, the processor controller data path to theCSE will be utilized to load the current information into the halt array and address substitution mechanism, which provides the translated addresses for accessing main store. In the present invention, only 2K main storage addresses must be reserved to provide substitute microinstructions for any of 8K faulty ROS microinstructions, plus 256 first cycle microinstructions. Further, permanent main storage address information can be stored in the first and second arrays of the address substitution mechanism. The first and second arrays of the address substitution mechanism are accessed with first and second portions of an input binary number which overlap, but is effected by not utilizing the XY branch decode bits used for accessing ROS. The XY branch bits are saved in case the main store address generated is required to provide a substitute microinstruction for more than one erroneous microinstruction in a particular branch group.Maintenance personnel will insert a proper microinstruction in main storage at the address generated, to either provide the substitute microinstruction for a single erroneous microinstruction from ROS, or will insert a microinstruction based on the previously stored XY branch decode bits. The present invention not only resolves more than one microinstruction error in a particular branch group, but also provides corrective action for a first cycle microinstruction word, and is therefore capable of resolving the corrective action required for five faulty microinstructions. The invention is defined with particularity in the appended claims. The above and further objects and advantages of this invention may be better understood by referring to the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in whichFIGURE 1 is a block diagram showing the major components of a control store element CSE .FIGURE 2 is a block diagram showing the addition of the present invention, and its relationship, to certain portions of FIGURE 1.FIGURE 3 is a representation of the main storage address compression achieved utilizing the address substitution mechanisms of the present invention.FIGURE 4 is a block diagram of one implemen tation of an address substitution mechanism. FIGURE 5 is a representation explaining the theory for achieving compression of main store addresses resulting from an address substitution mechanism shown in FIGURE 4. FIGURE 6 is a block diagram of the address substitution mechanism of the present invention providing address translation achieving further main store address compression. FIGURE 7 is a representation of a microinstruction sequence utilized in the address substitution mechanism of FIGURE 6. DETAI1ED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION FIGURE 1 is a block diagram showing the relationship of a Processor Controller 20, Main Storage 21, and a Control Store Element CSE of a contemporary data processing system. Only that portion of a CSE required to understand the present invention is shown. The CSE includes a Control Store Data Register CSDR 22 which stores, for each cycle, a microinstruction received on line 23 from either a Read Only ControlStore ROS 24 or a Pageable Control Store PCS 25. Each microinstruction stored in CSDR 22 includes a number of control fields 26, the decoding of which control the data flow, logic, and arithmetic of a data processing system. In many contemporary data processing systems utilizing a CSE, each microinstruction also includes the information necessary to address the next microinstruction in sequence. The address of the next microinstruction, often referred to in the literature as the next address NA , includes CSDR 22 bit positions 0 through 13. To provide branching capability in a microinstruction sequence, each microinstruction also includes an X branch control field 27.and a Y branch control field 28. The branch control fields 27 and 28 are coded to select a particular data processing machine condition to provide coded information for accomplishing a microprogram branch.The use of the branching capability will be discussed subsequently.An understanding of this capability is completely defined in the above cited Reference 2. The results of the branching capability are effective on a line 29 in FIGURE 1 to select one of four possible microinstructions addressed and accessed from either theROS 24 or PCS 25 to transfer the selected microinstruction on line 3 to the CSDR 22. A microprogrammer who is creating the sequence of microinstructions for the data processing system will have the ability to code each microinstruction in the CSDR 22 to cause address and accessing of microinstructions from either the ROS 24 or PCS 25. This selection is made by the state of NA bit position 0.A binary 0 will cause the remainder of the NA bit positions to be effective at Address Decode ao to effect access and readout of ROS 24. A binary 1 in NA bit position 0 will cause Address Decode 31 associated with PCS 25 to be effective. When NA bit position 0 is a binary 1101 , as signalled on line 32, the gate 33 will be effective to transfer NA bits 1 through 13 on lines 34 to the address decode 30 of ROS 24. When NA bit 0 is a binary 1 , as signalled on line 35, a gate 36 will be enabled to transfer NA bits 1 through 10 on a line 37 to a Pageable Address Directory 38, the function of which will be subsequently described. The signal on line 35 will also enable a gate 39 to transfer NA bits 11 through 13 on line 40 to be part of the address utilized in Address Decode 31 of PCS 25. The remainder of the address utilized in the address decode 31 of PCS 25 is transferred on line 41 from an Encode mechanism 42 associated with thePageable Address Directory 38. The proper operation of the Pageable AddressDirectory 38 requires a replacement algorithm which is provided by an LRU mechanism 43. The function of the Pageable Address Directory 38, Encode mechanism 42, and LRU mechanism 43 are thoroughly described in the above cited References 3 and 4. As indicated earlier, an area 44 is reserved inMain Storage 21 for the microcode which is to be transferred to the PCS 25 as required. The reserved area 44 is loaded with microcode from the ProcessorController 20. Each time a quantity of microcode is to be transferred from Main Storage 21 to PCS 25 on line 45, Main Storage 21 will be addressed by an AddressDecode mechanism 46 to cycle and transfer 512 consecutive 8 bit bytes on line 45 to PCS 25. The 512 bytes are configured to provide 32 microinstructions. These 32 microinstructions are identified as a line of microcode. In accordance with the manner in which the NA bits 1 through 13 are configured, NA bits 11, 12 and 13, along with the final 2 bits provided by the XY branching capability, identify a particular microinstruction within a line of 32 microinstructions. The remainder of the NXA bits are configured to provide identification of segments and lines within segments. That is, NA bits 1 through 5 are capable of identifying 32 segments of microcode and NA bits 6 through 1W are capable of identifying 32 lines within a particular segment of microcode. This addressing capability of NA bits 1 through 13 and the XY branch bits provides an addressing capability of 32K K l,024 microinstructions that could be stored in the reserved area 44. A preferred embodiment for the present invention utilizes less than this capability.In particular, the ROS 24 has been designed to permanently store 8K microinstructions.Therefore, whereas the Address Decode mechanism 30 is shown to be receiving 13 NA bits, only NA bits 3 through 13, along with the XY branch selection, are required to provide access to one of the 8K microinstructions. As shown in FIGURE 1, the PCS 25 is configured to include 32 lines of microcode totaling 1K microinstructions. In accordance with the teaching of the above cited References 3 and 4, each NA specifying a pageable main store address, indicated on line 35, will initiate an associative search in the PageableAddress Directory 38 to determine which line of PCS 25 contains the microcode line being addressed. If the line requested is stored in PCS 25, an associated one of the registers in the Pageable Address Directory 38, indicates the match and its identity will be encoded by Encode mechanism 42 to provide the five address bits required on line 41 to select the proper line in PCS 25. The remainder of the NA bits 11 through 13 will be transferred on line 40 to theAddress Decode mechanism 31 to select a branch group of four microinstructions from the line.The particular one of the microinstructions in the branch group to be transferred on line 23 to CSDR 22 is selected by the XY Branch Decode 29. If the line of pageable microcode identified byNA bits 1 through 10 do not find a match in the PageableAddress Directory 38, a signal on line 48 indicating a Miss will be effective at a gate 49 to transfer theNA bits 1 through 10 on line 50 to the Address Decode mechanism 46 to initiate transfer of the 512 bytes comprising the line of microcode required on line 45 to PCS 25. The LRU mechanism 43, in accordance with the teaching of Reference 4, will select the line ofPCS 25 least recently used to receive and store the line of microcode. The line of PCS 25 selected by the LRU mechanism 43 will cause the next address bits 1 through 10 to be stored in the associated register of the Pageable Address Directory 38. FIGURE 2 is a block diagram that includes certain portions of the apparatus disclosed in FIGURE 1. The same numeric designation has been utilized Additional structure of a CSE in a contemporary data processing system is included in FIGURE 2. A Present AddressRegister 51 stores the complete address, including theXY branch bits, utilized to access a microinstruction for transfer to the CSDR 22. When the Next Address portion 52 of each microinstruction is transferred to the address decoding mechanism 30 or 31 shown in FIGURE 1, it is transferred on line 53 to the Present AddressRegister 51. The Present Address Register 51 therefore retains the address of each microinstruction transferred to, and stored in, CSDR 22 during the cycle that the control fields 26 are effective. Another register shosm in FIGURE 2 is an Auxiliary Address Register 54 which is utilized in the contemporary data processing system to receive, on a line 55, control store address information from a number of other sources during the sequencing of the CSE. Also added to the description of FIGURE 2 is an additional input to the CSE in accordance with the above cited Reference 1 which discloses the concept of a first cycle control store in the CSE. That is, on the first cycle of any machine instruction execution the operation code of the machine instruction is utilized to access a control store element utilized only for the first cycle of machine instruction execution. FIGURE 2 shows a line 56 which receives the OP CODE portion of the machine instruction. When a signal on a line 57 indicates a first cycle of machine instruction execution, the gate 58 will be enabled to transfer the PP CODE bits on line 59 to the Present Address Register 51.Therefore, the Present Address Register 51 will store a representation of the OP CODE on line 56 during the cycle that the microinstruction accessed on the first cycle is stored in the CSDR 22. As indicated previously, there are a number of situations in which there is a desire to change the normal sequencing of previously written microcode stored in the ROS 24 of FIGURE 1. These situations could include the detection of a permanent error in a microinstruction, a particular microinstruction may be proper but other hardware of the data processing system may cause an error condition which must be rectified, the microinstruction accessed from the first cycle control store may be faulty, or the data processing system may be required to respond to an OPCODE of a machine instruction which it was not originally designed to execute.In all of these situations, it is the primary object of the present invention to inhibit the normal functioning of a microinstruction transferred to CSDR 22 and substitute a microinstruction to be accessed from the PCS 25 of FIGURE 1. The apparatus of the subject invention to achieve the above cited result includes a First Cycle HaltArray 60, a ROS Halt Array 61, and an Address Substitute mechanism 62. Each of the arrays 60 and 61 has a single bit storage position for each microinstruction that can conceivably create an error condition. If the OP CODE received on line 56 has eight bit positions, as is standard, the First Cycle Halt Array 60 will have 256 bit storage positions. In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the ROS 24 will store 8K microinstructions, and therefore theROS Halt Array 61 will be comprised of 8K bit storage positions. When either the First Cycle Halt Array 60 or theROS Halt Array 61 is accessed, either by the OP CODE on line 59, or the Next Address portion 52 on line 63, gated by the signal line 32 indicating a ROS 24 address, a binary 1 in the accessed bit storage position will provide a Halt signal on line 64 indicating an error situation, and will be effective on a line 65 to inhibit the operation of the control fields 26 of the microinstruction accessed from either the first cycle control store or the ROS 24 of FIGURE 1. The Processor Controller 20 of FIGURE 1 is utilized during the initialization of the data processing system to provide the proper pattern of binary 1 and binary 0 for the First Cycle Halt Array 60 or the ROS HaltArray 61. This information is created by maintenance personnel, and during the initialization process, will be input to the arrays on lines 66, 67 and 68. As the need for changes to microinstruction execution are noted, the proper bit patterns will be created by maintenance personnel for storage in the halt arrays at the address associated with the microinstruction to be inhibited. When a halt is indicated on signal line 64, the address stored in the Present Address Register 51 of the microinstruction is to be accessed, is transierred on a line 69 through a gate 70 to the Address Substitute mechanism 62. The Address Substitute mechanism 62 will then effect a translation of the address stored in the Present Address Register 51 to a main storage address for transfer on line 71 to the AuxiliaryAddress Register 54. As part of the address translation process, bit position 0 of the Present Address Register 51, shown as a binary 0 at 72, will be translated to a binary 1 shown at 73 in the Auxiliary AddressRegister 54.Thereafter, the address stored in AuxiliaryAddress Register 54, which is a main storage address, will be transferred on line 74 to the PageableAddress Directory 38 to initiate a normal PCS 25 access function as described in connection withFIGURE 1. The Processor Controller 20 of FIGURE 1 is utilized to input information on lines 66 and 75 to provide, during the initialization process, the address in MainStorage 21 of FIGURE 1 of the microinstruction to be substituted for the erroneous microinstruction. The main storage address on line 75, to be associated with the erroneous r.icroinstruction address in PresentAddress Register 51, will be stored in the AddressSubstitute mechanism 62 to thereafter be generated on line 71 whenever the erroneous microinstruction address is utilized. FIGURE 3 shows a number of alternative methods by which main storage addresses for the substitute microinstruction can be created for entry into the AddressSubstitute mechanism 62 of FIGURE 2. One technique would require each of the 8K ROS addresses 76 to be provided with an associated main storage address 77 creating an 8K storage patch area 77. With this arrangement, the only requirement for the Address Substitute mechanism 62 of FIGURE 2 is to convert the address position 72 in the Present Address Register 51 from a binary 0 to a binary 1 in the AuxiliaryAddress Register 54. This alternative creates a very simple Address Substitute mechanism 62, but is very wasteful of main storage address space in that 8K main storage microinstruction addresses must be permanently reserved. Another alternative is shown in FIGURE 3 where the next address liy bits 53 are utilized to address an 8K Address Substitute Table 78. That is, each pcssible 8 ROS address will have an addressable entry in the Address Substitute Table 78 only if the particular address provides access to an erroneous microinstruction. Therefore, the Address Substitute mechanism 62 of FIGURE 2 would not only detect an erroneous microinstruction, but provides the ability to reserve only one main storage position for each badROS position as indicated at 79. Therefore, with the inclusion of a comparatively expensive Address Substitute Table 78, a great deal of compression can be realized in Main Storage 21 with very little space set aside for substitute microinstructions. Preferred forms for the Address Substitute mechanism 62 of FIGURE 2 will be described subsequently, and are represented in FIGURE 3 at 80 and 81. An 8K ROS address space 80 can be compressed to a StoragePatch Area 81 which is a compromise between the amount of main storage addresses that must be reserved for substitute microinstructions, and the expense and efficiency of the address translation performed by the Address Substitute mechanism 62 of FIGURE 2. As represent d, the 8K ROS addresses 80 range from 0000 to 1FFF each position representing a hexadecimal digit comprised of four binary bits , to a StoragePatch Area 81 which ranges from main storage addressesF800 through FFFF, a total of 2K microinstruction addresses.Hexadecimal notation is fairly common, but the particular representation of four binary bits representing a hexadecimal digit is shown in FIGURE 5. FIGURE 4 depicts the Address Substitute mechanism 62 described in Related Application 2, between thePresent Address Register 51 and the Auxiliary AddressRegister 54 shown in FIGURE 2. The Address Substitute mechanism 62 is comprised of a First Translation Array 82 and a Second Translation Array 83. The format of an address to be translated may include a first cycle format shown at 84 or any other ROS address shown at 85. The address of a first cycle microinstruction includes an 8 bit OP CODE in bit positions 4 thrcugh 11. Also shown at 84 is a Mode bit in position 12 which may signify the presence of an OP CODE in a data processing system having, for example, two different instruction sets.The remainder of the bit positions shown at 84 will be a binary 11011. At 85, only bit positions 3 through 15 are needed to signify a ROS address range from 0 through Nç Bit positions 0 through 2 will be a binary 0 in all cases, and signify a ROS address. A translated address is to be inserted in theAuxiliary Address Register 54 from the First andSecond Translation Arrays 82 and 83. Bit positions 0 through 2 comprise a prefix value which, in register 51, signify a ROS address and which will be altered to binary 1 to signify a main storage pageable address to be utilized in the PCS 25 access mechanism of FIGURE 1. The desirable feature of providing compression of main storage addresses is achieved by providing aFirst Translation Array 82 and a Second TranslationArray 83. The two arrays are each addressed utilizing first and second portions of the address information in the Present Address Register 51. That is, FirstTranslation Array 82 is addressed by bit positions 3 through 9, and the Second Translation Array 83 is addressed by bit positions 10 through 15.The addressed positions in each of the arrays 82 and 83 will have been provided with proper main storage addresses as determined by maintenance personnel and received from the Processor Controller 20. The output of the First Translation Array 82 will provide a substitute address in bit positions 3 through 9, and the Second Translation Array 83 will provide substitute address information in bit positions 10 through 15. The substitute address provided to the AuxiliaryAddress Register 54 will then be transferred on line 74 to access the Pageable Address Directory 38 shown in FIGURE 2. FIGURE 5 will be utilized to explain the theory behind the information to be stored into the FirstTranslation Array 82 and Second Translation Array 83 of FIGURE 4, as determined by maintenance personnel when erroneous operation is recognized at particularROS addresses. At the left of FIGURE 5 under the heading Present Address is shown an example of sixteen ROS addresses ranging from 0 through F in hexadecimal notation. The designation of a ROS address is shown by the leftmost binary bit position, all of which are a binary 0 . Erroneous microinstruction operation at addresses 2 , 9 and D are indicated by an asterisk.Under the heading Pageable Address, No Compression the address translation technique whereby only the highest order binary bit position is changed, from binary 0 to binary 1 shows that sixteen main storage addresses must be set aside for substitute microinstructions. At the right of FIGURE 5, under the heading With Com pression, the use of a First Translation Array 82 and Second Translation Array 83 is shown to provide a compression of the number of main storage addresses that must be set aside for substitute microinstructions. As represented in FIGURE 5, the First TranslationArray 82 will be addressed by the first two bits of the present address, and the Second Translation Array 83 will be addressed by the second two bits. The error condition indicated at address number 2 , causes the translation arrays 82 and 83 to be addressed as shown, and provide a translated address output of hexadecimal 0 . A second erroneous address is noted at address 9 . The first and second arrays 82 and 83 will be provided with translated addresses by the maintenance personnel to provide an output of hexadecimal 1 . When a third erroneous microinstruction at address D is recognized, the translated address information provided by the maintenance personnel must provide an output that will distinguish from the output provided when the translation arrays 82 and 83 are accessed by the erroneous address 9 . The first translation array 82 is provided with the required information to create a unique translated address. This is accomplished by changing the location in the first translation array 82 addressed by the first two addressbits to provide an output of 01 . Thereafter, the translated address provided by the translation arrays 82 and 83 will result in a pageable address of hexadecimal 5 for the erroneous ROS address D . The Address Substitute mechanism 62 as implemented in accordance ith FIGURE 4 has achieved unique translation and cornpression of main storage address requirements in an efficient and inexpensive manner. This was through a recognition that only a sub set of 8K possible addresses would require a substitute microinstruction. A substantial reduction in size and cost of the translation arrays 82 and 83 over an SR translation table providing sixteen bit outputs is readily apparent.Each of the arrays 82 and 83 can be readily available and inexpensive 256x8 merry chips, providing sufficient translation capabilities for the number of nicrcisructicns actually needing substitution. The present invention is depicted in FIGURE 6.Once again, a First Translation Array 88 and SecondTranslation Array S9 are provided. Each of these arrays are comprised of 256 locations, each providing an 8 bit output. The arrays 88 and 89 are addressed with 8 bits of the Present Address Register 51 which are provided in an overlapped fashion. That is, address bit positions 3 10 are utilized for addressingFirst Translation Array 88, and address bit positions 6 through 13 are utilized to address the Second Translation Array 89. The embodiment shown in FIGURE 6 differs from that shown in FIGURE 4 in that a third portion of the address in the Present Address Register 51, namely the low order XY branch selection bits are gated by the Halt signal 64 effective at gate 90, to corresponding triggers 91 and 92 for subsequent use. In FIGURE 6, only 2K microinstruction addresses in main storage are set aside for providing a substitute microinstruction for any of the 8K ROS microinstructions and the 256 possible first cycle microinstructions. The Address Substitute mechanism 62 of FIGURE 2, shown in FIGURE 6, differs from FIGURE 4 in that the binary bit patterns in the First Translation Array 88 and Second Translation Array 89 can be made permanent and require no modification as erroneous microinstructions are subsequently detected. As shown, the range of ROS addresses, including addresses created during a first cycle, will range from a hexadecimal 0000 through 1FFF, as depicted at 93 totaling 8K. The 2K main storage addresses set aside in the reserved area 44 of FIGURE 1 are caused to have an address range from F800 shown at 94 to FFFF as shown at 95.These values can be inserted permanently in First Translation Array 88 and Second Translation Array 89, or flexibility can be given to maintenance personnel by allowing them to most efficiently create main storage addresses within these ranges as required. By providing permanent assignments, the maintenance personnel utilizing the ProcessorController 20 of FIGURE 1 will only be required to provide the necessary information to update the FirstCycle Halt Array 60, or ROS Halt Array 61 of FIGURE 2, and create the necessary microinstructions for storage in their proper location in the reserved area 44 ofFIGURE 1. The 2K main storage microinstruction addresses reserved for translated addresses, creates what is known as a synonym problem. That is, the substitute address created in the Auxiliary Address Register 54, to be utilized in the PCS 25 access m thod of FIGURE 1, is associated with four possible ROS microinstructions and one possible first cycle microinstruction 1Cw . The XY branch bits identify a particular microinstruction in a branch group, and are used for addressing the ROS Halt Array 61 of FIGURE 2. If more than one microinstruction in a particular branch group is in error, the address bits 3 through 13 utilized for addressing the First and Second TranslationArrays 88 and 89 will not provide a translated address which identifies the particular microinstruction requiring a substitute microinstruction. The translated address inserted in the AuxiliaryAddress Register 54 will provide access to a microinstruction provided by the maintenance personnel which will be coded as a first type or second type.If only one microinstruction of a branch group is known to be in error, the translated address will access a substitute microinstruction of a first type that can be immediately executed in place of the faulty microinstruction. If a second microinstruction of a branch group is determined to be in error, then maintenance personnel must provide access to a microinstruction of a second type that has properly coded XY branch control fields to provide access to a substitute microinstruction associated with each of the faulty microinstructions in the branch group. In other words, the microinstruction accessed by the translated address through the PCS 25 access mechanism will include, as shown in FIGURE 1, an X branch code field 27 and a Y branch control field 28, which will be coded to sample the binary state of the triggers 91 and 92. This concept is depicted in FIGURE 7. The XY branch bit combinations are shown at the left inFIGURE 7 along with a first cycle word lCW indication.In FIGURE 6, when the First Cycle Halt Array 60 ofFIGURE 2 produces a Halt signal 64 during a first cycle, a trigger 96 will be set which can be subsequently sampled by a microinstruction branch decode control field. As shown in FIGURE 7, two different microinstructions from a particular microinstruction branch group from ROS 24 of FIGURE 1 have been indicated as being in error by an output on line 64 of the ROSHalt Array 61 of FIGURE 2. The branch group identified by address bits 3 through 13 in the PresentAddress Register 51 are shown to provide an output from the First and Second Translation Arrays 88 and 89 providing a translated address F800 utilized for addressing Main Storage 21 of FIGURE 1. The microinstruction located at address F800 will be of the second type, and have an X branch decode field 27 and a Y decode branch field 28 specifying triggers 91 and 92 respectively for testing. The microinstruction located at F800 specifies a next address field F804 which will cause access from PCS 25 of a branch group of microinstructions depicted at 97.The particular one of the microinstructions in the branch group at 97 will be read out to the CSDR 22 based on the binary state of the X trigger 91 and Y trigger 92 of FIGURE 64 For example, if the Halt signal was generated by a microinstruction accessed by XY branch bits shown at 98, the sampling of the X trigger 91 and Y trigger 92 by the microinstruction at location F800 will provide readout into the CSDR 22 of FIGURE 1 of the microinstruction indicated at 99. This is a microinstruction of the first type, and will be the substitute microinstruction providing the fix for the erroneous microinstruction. In a like manner, the microinstruction shown at 100 in the branch group 97 would be transferred to the CSDR 22 as the substitute microinstruction for the one indicated as being in error at 101. If it has been determined that a first cycle word 1cue is in error, shown at 102, the microprogrammer providing the fix for this error condition would have inserted microinstructions into the reserved area 44 of Main Store 21 in FIGURE 1 in which the microinstruction at 103 would be coded as a microinstruction of a third type with a next address field that accesses a branch group of microinstructions depicted at 104. This is required to resolve the possibility that the microinstruction in error is from a ROS 24 branch group with XY branch bits of 00, and therefore one branch decode field must sample the lCW trigger 96. The microinstruction at locationF804 would have an X branch decode field 27 or Y branch decode field 28 which samples the first cycle trigger 96 to provide selection of the microinstruction of a first type noted at 105. The microinstruction shown at 105 would be the microinstruction to be substituted for the erroneous microinstruction encountered during that particular first cycle. In the showing of FIGURE 7, the translated address F800 generated from the First TranslationArray 88 and Second Translation Array 89, when presented to the Pageable Address Directory 38 ofFIGURE 1, would probably create a miss situation requiring access to the reserved area 44 of MainStorage 21. Access to Main Storage 21 returns on line 45 to PCS 25, a line of 32 microinstructions.Therefore, once access has been made for these 32 microinstructions, as shown in FIGURE 7, all of the remaining microinstructions that might be accessed as a result of accessing microinstructions at F800 will find a hit in the Pageable Address Directory 38 ofFIGURE 1, providing immediate access to any of the subsequent microinstructions shown in FIGURE 7. Even though a synonym problem has been created by the apparatus shown in FIGURE 6, one or more microinstructions accessed by the translated address will resolve the synonym situation to identify the proper substitute microinstruction to be utilized. While the invention has been particularly shown and described with references to a plural embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
