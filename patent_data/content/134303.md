# Menthyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate and resolution of the same.

## Abstract
An ester obtained from 2,2 dimethyl cyclopropanecarboxylic acid and optically active menthol, represented by the formula, Unnecessary diastereomeric ester, remained after re solution, can be epimerized selectively on the acid moiety. Combination of the resolution and the epimerization provides an efficient method for production of optically active 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid.
