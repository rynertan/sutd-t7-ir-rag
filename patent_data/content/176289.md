# Video signal memories.

## Abstract
A video signal memory 21 which may, for example, form a field memory in a special effects equipment of a high definition video system, provides storage for n²m video data words and comprises n² memory modules 22 each capable of storing m video data words corresponding respectively to sample values at respective sample positions of a raster display, each memory module 22 being arranged to store one only of the video data words in any square of n by n sample positions of the raster in any one write cycle, and means to write up to n video data words corresponding to n adjacent collinear sample positions of the raster in the video memory 21 in any one write cycle.
