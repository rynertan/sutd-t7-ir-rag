# Improved synthesis of ultra pure high crystallinity silicas.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an improved process for producing ultra pure high crystallinity porous silicas by dealuminating a crystalline aluminosilicate, optionally in the presence of a silicon compound, and calcining the dealuminated product at a high temperature. The dealumination step may be carried out by steam treatment of the aluminosilicate. Unlike conventional processes the present invention does not rely on low alumina aluminosilicates produced from relatively expensive raw materials such as tetraalkyl ammonium hydroxides.

## Description
IMPROVED SYNTHESIS OF ULTRA PURE HIGH CRYSTALLINITY SILICAS The present invention relates to an improved synthesis of ultrapure high crystallinity porous silicas. Hitherto such silicas have been produced directly from aluminium free starting materials and in some cases it is necessary to use the relatively expensive tetraalkyl ammonium species as starting material. Such processes are described for instance in USP 4016724 for silicalite, USP 4104294 for tetraethyl ammonium silicate and byBibby, D.M. et al in Nature, 280 No 5724 , 664 665, 1979 for silicalite II. In each of these cases, the silicas are relatively expensive to produce because of the need to use either aluminium free starting materials or the tetraalkyl ammonium species or both. GoodX ray crystalline materials with low bulk aluminium contents can be prepared by such routes but it is reported that unless exceptional precautions are taken there can be residual aluminium in the framework structure eg see Fyfe, C.A. et al, Nature, 1982, 296, pp 533 5 .A particularly sensitive test used in the case of the MFI type zeolite structures is the resolution of the crystallographically distinctSi zero Al peaks of the 29Si MASNMR spectrum Fyfe, C.A. et al loc.cit which appears proportional to the purity of the SiO2 n framework. Thus siliceous materials which show highly resolvedSi zero Al peaks can be called ultra pure . A further method of preparing highly siliceous porous materials is by dealumination, eg steaming and leaching of aluminosilicates as described in USP 3493519. However, it has proved difficult to prepare ultra pure materials by this route. Silylation eg with silicon tetrachloride has also been used see USP 4273753 and Beyer, H.K. andBelenykaja, I., in Catalysis by Zeolites , Imelik, B. et al., eds ,Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1980, p 203 but silicon tetrachloride is also relatively expensive and is limited to starting materials with pore structures which will allow diffusion of the relatively large silicon tetrachloride molecules therethrough. It has now been found that ultra pure highly crystalline porous silicas can be prepared by a high temperature thermal treatment of previously dealuminated alumino silicates. Accordingly, the present invention is a process for the production of ultra pure, highly crystalline porous silicas from crystalline aluminosilicates which have a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 2 1 characterised in that the aluminosilicate is subjected to a dealumination stage and the dealuminated product is subjected to a thermal treatment at a temperature above 6500C. The aluminosilicates that may be used in the process of the present invention include crystalline aluminosilicates which have a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 2 1, suitably from 5 1 to 1000 1, preferably from 10 1 to 300 1. Specific examples of the types of crystalline aluminosilicates that may be used include zeolites.Zeolites can be defined as natural or synthetic ordered porous crystalline alumino silicates having a framework structure sufficiently open to accommodate at least water molecules. Such structures generally contain a regular array of small voids interconnected by channels or pores. The dimensions of the voids and channels can range from those of water to those of quite large molecules. For a given framework structure, the dimensions of the voids and channels are limited to a small number of values, which can vary from structure to structure. Zeolites are best characterised according to framework structure type, i.e. on the topology of the framework, irrespective of composition, distribution of differentf tetrahedral atoms, cell dimensions and symmetry.A code consisting of three capital letters has been adopted for each known structure type following the recommendations by IUPAC on zeolite nomenclature ChemicalNomenclature, and Formulation of Compositions, of Synthetic and Natural Zeolites, IUPAC yellow booket, 1978 and a compilation of 38 known zeolite structure types has been published by The StructureCommission of the International Zeolite Association Atlas of ZeoliteStructure Types, By Meier, W M and Olsen, D H 1978 , distributed byPolycrystal Book Service, Pittsburgh, Pa, USA . In addition to the groups classified by known structure type, there is a further group of crystalline zeolite materials whose X ray diffraction patterns, sorption, ion exchange and related properties indicate that they do not have known structure types but appear to have new, as yet undetermined structure types.An example of such a material is the novel porous crystalline aluminosilicate designated Theta i and described in our published copending European patent specificationNo 0057049. Other examples can be obtained from ZSM 12 USP 3832449 , ZSM 23 USP 4076842 , ZSM 38 USP 4046859 , ZSM 48 European PatentApplication 15132 , EU 1 European Patent Application 42226 , EU 2 GBApplication 2077709 , Nu l USP 4060590 , Nu 3 European PatentApplication 40016 , Fu l GB 1563345 , ZSM 30 European PatentApplication 41621 , MB 28 European Patent Application 21445 and zeolite Beta USP 3308069 . Resolution of crystallographically distinct peaks in the 29SiNASNMR spectrum is a suitable test for such ultra pure, highly crystalline porous silicas. Such peaks are due to the crystallographically distinct silicon sites in the all silica version of a structure type. Some structure types, e.g. FAU heifer, W M andOlsen D.H, loc.cit. have only one crystallographically distinct silicon site in their all silica version. Thus this paricular test is not applicable to e.g. the FAU type structure though there is no intrinsic chemical reason why the procedures outlined above should not lead to ultra pure, highly crystalline porous silicas having such structure types. The initial dealumination of the aluminosilicate may be carried out by any of the conventional methods known in the art. These may include method where the aluminium species removed from the framework is at least partly replaced by silicon species inherently present in the aluminosilicate often termed healing or by silicon species introduced from an external source in the course of the dealumination reaction often termed substitution .Examples of known processes that may be used include those described for instance in a USP 3442795 hydrolysis of aluminosilicate to detach some of the aluminium atoms from the crystal lattice and physically removing the detached aluminium atoms b USP 4273753 contacting the aluminosilicates with an inorganic halide or oxyhalide at a temperature high enough to volatilize the aluminium halide or oxyhalide formed it is to be noted that if e.g. SiC14 is used, then concomittant substitution of aluminium by silicon in the framework can also occur c USP 3591488 subjecting the aluminosilicate to steam treatment at elevated temperature and removing amorphous alumina so formed by contacting with a dilute mineral acid or an organic chelating agent and d European Patent Application 0082211 subjecting the aluminosilicate to treatment with aqueous solutions of a fluorosilicate salt at controlled values of pH, temperature and concentration which leads to substitution of aluminium in the framework by silicon . The precise treatment s chosen will depend upon the structure type, composition and crystalline order of the starting material. Generally, structures with lower SiO2 A1203 ratios will require milder treatments to avoid structural collapse. In some cases a combination of treatments will be most appropriate. Of these the type of dealumination process described inUSP 3591488 is preferred. That is, the aluminosilicate is initially subjected to a steaming step which is followed subsequently by a washing step with a dilute acid or a chelating agent. The steaming step is carried out by passing a gaseous stream containing from 1 to 100 steam over the aluminosilicate at a temperature from 400 to 7500C for a duration of from 5 minutes to 60 days. The gaseous stream containing steam may contain one or more carrier gases which are inert under the dealumination conditions with respect to the silica product, ie those which do not leave any deposits which can adversely affect the properties of the final product. The pressure used for this steaming step is suitably from 0.1 to 10 bar.In a more preferred embodiment, the steaming step is carried out by passing a gaseous stream containing from 20 to 100 steam, at a temperature from 5300 to 650 C for a period of between 1 and 10 hours and at a pressure of 1 bar absolute. The carrier gas used is preferably selected from one or more of air, oxygen, nitrogen, the noble gases and hydrogen. It should be noted that gases such as methane and carbon tetrachloride which tend to deposit carbon or other elements should be avoided. The steaming step is preferably carried out on an aluminosilicate free of exchanged metal cations. This can be conveniently achieved by one or more acid or ammonium washes prior to steaming. Obviously care must be taken to avoid structural collapse during washing and steaming. Thus, for example, aluminosilicates with low silica to alumina ratios should not be washed under low pH conditions and are preferably initially steamed after only partial exchange of metal cations. It would be clear to those skilled in the art that within the ranges of steaming conditions and parameters specified an increase in the severity of one or more parameters will allow a corresponding reduction in one or more of the remaining parameters. The steaming step may be repeated more than once as necessary. The washing step, which follows the steaming step is suitably carried out by bringing into contact the steam treated aluminosilicate with an agent capable of dissolving or chelating trivalent aluminium released from the lattice framework of the crystalline aluminosilicate during the steaming step. This may be achieved by washing the aluminosilicate resulting from the steaming step with a solution containing one or more agents selected from ammonium compounds, acids and a chelating agent.Examples of complexing agents which are extremely effective in carrying out the process of the present invention include but are not restricted to EDTA ethylediaminetetraacetic acid di tetraethyl ammonium dihydrogen EDTA diammonium dihydrogen EDTA ammonium and manganese EDTA fluorides, such as sodium or ammonium fluoride carboxylic and polycarboxylic acids and acid salts, such as citric acid and ammonium acid citrate mixtures of such complexing agents etc. Various other complexing agents, containing a variety of anionic portions, may also be used in the process of the present invention provided they meet the criteria set forth hereinbefore. For a comprehensive review of complexing agents, see Organic SequesteringAgents by Stanley Chaberek and Arthur E. Martell, published by JohnWiley and Sons, Inc., New York 1959 , and an article entitled Chelation by Harold F. Walton, Scientific American, June 1953, pp 68 76. The agent capable of dissolving or chelating the trivalent aluminium is suitably used in a molar concentration of from 0.01 to 5 preferably from 0.1 to 1. The washing step is suitably carried out by bringing the stgam treated aluminosilicate into contact with the agent between room and reflux temperatures of the solution for a period of 0.5 to 16 hours preferably 1 4 hours. As would be evident, the higher the temperature the shorter the contact time. The washing step may be repeated more than once as is necessary. The combined steaming and washing steps may be repeated more than once as is necessary. The dealuminated product so formed is then subjected to a thermal treatment preferably at a temperature from 650 to 1400 C or higher, provided the temperature is not sufficient to destroy the porous crystalline structure of the dealuminated product, to produce the ultra pure high crystallinity silica. By destruction of porous crystalline structure is meant that the heating within the specified temperature range should be controlled so as to avoid transition to denser crystalline or amorphous, solid or liquid phases e.g.conversion to quartz or melting. The thermal treatment is suitably carried out at a temperature from 800 to 13000C at a pressure of 1 bar absolute. The thermal treatment is suitably carried out in a dry, gaseous atmosphere. The dry gaseous atmosphere should be inert under the reaction conditions. By inert is meant gases which do not deposit carbon on other elements under the thermal treatment conditions. Examples of suitable gases which may be used include dry air, nitrogen, hydrogen, the noble gases and oxygen. Dry air is preferred. The thermal treatment is suitably carried out for a duration of from 5 minutes to 60 days. The resultant product after thermal treatment is the ultra pure high crystallinity porous silica which is substantially free from aluminium atoms or compounds. Such porous silicas are valuable selective sorbents and catalyst supports. The process of the present invention is cheaper, more flexible, and capable of consistently reproducing the ultra pure high crystallinity porous silicas than the processes used hitherto. In particular, the process is effective for producing MFI type silicas also known as silicalite . The present invention is further illustrated with reference to the following Examples.Example 1 a MFI type Zeolite Synthesis In the synthesis of the MFI type zeolite the following reactants were used Sodium hydroxide 14.7g Sodium aluminate 44.7 Diethanolamine 289.9g Ludox AS 40 849.9g 40Z w w colloidal silica Registered Trade Mark Deionised water 1018.4g Sodium hydroxide and sodium aluminate were dissolved in deionised water 350g by warming and stirring for 10 minutes. The solution was then filtered and placed in a 3 litre flask. Diethanolamine was melted and added to this solution and the whole stirred for 10 minutes maintaining the temperature at 400C. The colloidal silica was then diluted with the remainder of the deionised water 678.4g and then slowly added to the mixture in the flask, over a period of 1 hour. During this addition the temperature was maintained at 400C and the mixture, which gradually thickened, stirred continuously. Stirring was continued for 0.5 hr after the silica had been added. The mixture was charged to a 3 litre rocking autoclave which was agitated for 4 hours while the temperature was raised to 1750C. The autoclave was then agitated at this temperature for 7 days. Thereafter the autoclave was opened and the white cyrstalline zeolite which had formed was separated from the mother liquor by filtration. b Pre treatment of Zeolite The crystalline zeolite was then washed thoroughly first with deionised water and then with a 10Z nitric acid solution. Thereafter the acid treated zeolite was washed thorougly with deionised water to remove any traces of acid. This was then dried in an oven at 1000C for 16 hours. The acid washed zeolite had bulk silicon to aluminium molar ratio of 15.3 1 and the framework silicon to aluminium molar ratio measured by 29SiMASNMR spectroscopy was 19 1. c Steam Treatment About 20 gms of this MFI type zeolite in its acid washed form was first steam treated as follows The zeolite was brought into contact with steam at 5800C for 60 hours and then cooled. The resulting steam treated zeolite was then subjected to washing step. d Washing Step The washing step was carried out by first contacting the steam treated material with approximately 10D w w nitric acid solution 106 ml under reflux for 2.5 hours which was then filtered, washed with distilled water and then dried at 1000C for 16 hours. The resultant dried product was then washed for a second time by contacting with 0.67 molar ammonium nitrate solution 100 ml under reflux for 4 hours. The ref fluxed material was then washed with distilled water and then dried at 1000C to give a dealuminated product. e Thermal Treatment The dealuminated product was finally subjected to a thermal treatment step. This involved heating the dealuminated product at 11600C for 16 hours in flowing air after which period it was cooled. Examination of the thermally treated product by 29Si MASNMR spectroscopy revealed a spectrum which showed no evidence of any framework aluminium in the product. The spectrum showed highly resolved and crystallographically distinct Si zero Al peaks consistent with ultra pure highly crystalline silicalite. This fine structure was absent both in the as prepared zeolite after step b above and in the steamed washed zeolite after steps c and d above.Example 2 a MFI type zeolite synthesis In the synthesis of the MFI type zeolite the following reactants were used. Sodium hydroxide 12.8g Sodium aluminate 42.3g Diethanolamine 312.7g Ludox AS40 851.5g Registered Trade Mark Distilled water 1013.3g Sodium hydroxide and sodium aluminate were dissolved in distilled water 339.3g by warming and stirring for 10 minutes. The solution was placed in a 3 litre flask. Diethanolamine was melted and added to this solution and the whole stirred for 10 minutes maintaining the temperature at 400C. The colloidal silica was then diluted with the remainder of the deionised water 674.0g and then slowly added to the mixture in the flask, over a period of 1 hour. During this addition the temperature was maintained at 40 C and the mixture, which gradually thickened, stirred continuously. Stirring was continued for 0.5 hours after the silica had been added.The mixture was charged to a 3 litre rocking autoclave which was agitated while the temperature was raised to 1720C. The autoclave was then agitated at this temperature for 7 days. Thereafter the autoclave was opened and the while crystalline zeolite which had formed was separated from the mother liquor by filtration. The zeolite was dried at 1000C in air for 16 hours. b Pre treatment of Zeolite The crystalline zeolite was washed thoroughly with a 10 nitric acid solution, then dried in an oven at 1000C for 16 hours. The acid washed zeolite had bulk silicon to aluminium molar ratio of 16.9 1 and the framework silicon to aluminium molar ratio measured by 29Si MASNMR spectroscopy was 25 1. About 50g of this zeolite was heated to 5400C at a rate of 400C an hour and maintained at this temperature for 60 hours then cooled.The calcined zeolite was contacted with approximately 10X w w nitric acid solution 350 ml under reflux for 3 hours. The mixture was then filtered and the zeolite residue washed with distilled water and then dried at 1000C for 16 hours. The dried product was contacted with 0.68 molar ammonium nitrate solution 350 ml under reflux for 5 hours. The mixture was then filtered and the zeolite residue washed with distilled water and the dried at 1000C for 16 hours. c Steam Treatment and Washing About 20g of this MFI type zeolite was steamtreated 5 times as follows. Each time the zeolite was brought into contact with steam 20 volume at about 600 to 6400C for 2 to 5 hours then cooled. After each steam treatment the zeolite was subjected to washing steps. After the first steam treatment the zeolite was contacted with 10X w w nitric acid solution under reflux twice, then with 40 w w nitric acid solution under reflux eight times. After filtering for the last time the zeolite residue was washed with distilled water and then dried at 1000C for 16 hours. After the second, third and fourth steam treatments the zeolite was contacted, each time, with iminodiacetic acid approximately 5g in ref fluxing distilled water 125ml for 24 hours and then filtered.The zeolite residue was washed each time with distilled water and then dried at 1000C for 16 hours. After the fifth steam treatment the zeolite was contacted with NH4 2H2EDTA 4.9g in refluxing distilled water 120ml for 4 hours and then filtered. The zeolite residue was wahsed with distilled water and then dried at 100C for 16 hours. d Thermal Treatment The dealuminated product was finally subjected to a thermal treatment step. This involved heating the dealuminated product to 800 C at a rate of 400C an hour and maintaining this temperature for 26 hours in flowing air after which period it was cooled. Examination of the thermally treated product by 29Si MASNMR spectroscopy revealed a spectrum which showed no evidence of any framework aluminium in the product. The spectrum showed well resovled and crystallographically distrinct Si zero Al peaks consistent with ultra pure highly crystalline silicalite. This fine structure was absent both in the as prepared zeolite after step b above and in the steamed and washed zeolite after step c above.Example 3 a Theta 1 was prepared according to European Patent Application No. 0057049 and pretreated according to methods described therein. The framework silicon to aluminium molar ratio measured by 29Si MASNMR spectroscopy was 52t10 1. b Steam Treatment and Washing A sample of this zeolite was brought into contact with steam 20 volume at 5900C for 19 hours and the cooled. The resulting steam treated zeolite was subjected to a washing step by contacting it with approximately 10 w w nitric acid solution 100ml at about 800C for 6.5 hours then filtering. The zeolite reside was washed with distilled water and then dried at 1000C for 16 hours. c Thermal Treatment The dealuminated product was subjected to a thermal treatment step. This inolved heating the dealuminated product to 800 C at a rate of 400C an hour, and maintaining this temperature for 50 hours in air after which period it was cooled. Examination of the thermally treated product by 29Si MASNMR spectroscopy revealed a spectrum which showed no evidence of any framework aluminium in the product. The spectrum showed three well resolved and crystallographicically distinct Si zero Al peaks indicative of a highly silicon rich framework. This fine structure was absent both after steps a and b .
