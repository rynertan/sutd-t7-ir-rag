## Description
DIPHENYL SULFONE COMPOUNDS, AND THEIR PRODUCTION AND USE The present invention relates to diphenyl sulfone compounds, and their production and use. More particularly, it relates to novel diphenyl sulfone compounds bearing a 2chloro 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy group on the benzene ring, and their preparation processes and their use as herbicides. The said diphenyl sulfone compounds are representable by the formula EMI1.1 wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkoxy group and X and Y are, same or different, each a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxy group, a carboxy lower alkoxy group or a lower alkoxycarbonyl lower alkoxy group. Among them, preferred are those of the formula EMI1.2 wherein R is a lower alkoxy group and X isa hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a lower alkyl group or a lower alkoxy group. Particularly preferred are those of the formulas EMI2.1 Throughout the specification, the term lower is intended to mean any group having not more than four carbon atoms, unless otherwise defined. The term halogen may include chlorine, bromine, iodine and fluorine. Some diphenyl sulfone compounds are disclosed in Gazz. Chim. Ital., 91, 223 1961 , but this literature is entirely silent on whether they have any herbicidal activity. It has now been found that the diphenyl sulfone compounds of the formula I exert a strong herbicidal activity against a wide variety of weeds which may cause a serious damage on important crop plants such as rice plant, corn, wheat and soybean by pre emergence treatment as well as post emergence treatment. Namely, when applied to paddy fields by foliar and or soil treatment in pre emergence or post emergence, the diphenyl sulfone compounds I can prevent and exterminate monocotyledonous weeds including Gramineae weeds such as barnyardgrass Echitochloa crus ga lli and annualCyperaceae weeds such as rice flatsedge Cyperus sp. and small flower umbrella plant Cyperus difformis , broadleaved weeds such as false pimpernel Lindernia pyxidaria ,Vandellia angustifolia, Dopatrium junceum, monochoria Monochoria vaginalis , toothcup Rotala indica and Long stemmed waterwort Elatine triandra , perennial weeds such as arrowhead Sagittaria pygmaea , etc. Further, when applied to farmlands by foliar and or soil treatment in pre emergence or post emergence, they prevent and exterminate broad leaved weeds such as common lambsquarters Chenopodium album , velvetleaf Abtilon theophrasti , tall morningglory Ipoea purpurea , redroot pigweed Amaranthus retroflexus and wild buckwheat Polygonum convolvulus , narrow leaved weeds such as flatsedge Cyperus sp. , barnyardgrass Echinochloa crus galli , green foxtail Setaria viridis , large arabgrass Digitaria sanguinalis , fall panicum Panicum dichotomiflorum , goosegrass Eleusine indica , downy brome Bromus tectorum and quackgrass Aqropyron repens , etc. At the practical dose, they do not produce any material phytotoxicity on crop plants such as rice plant, corn, wheat and barley.Thus, they are useful as herbicides applicable to paddy fields and farmlands. Besides, due to their high herbicidal potency and broad herbicidal spectrum, they may be used as herbicides for orchards, non agricultural fields, forests, etc. The diphenyl sulfone compounds I are per novel and may be produced by various procedures, of which typical examples are as follows Procedure A A benzenesulfonyl halide compound of the formula EMI4.1 wherein X1 is a halogen atom e.g. chlorine, bromine is reacted with a benzene compound of the formula EMI4.2 wherein X and Y are each as defined above in the presence of a Lewis acid to give the diphenyl sulfone compound of the formula EMI5.1 wherein X and Y are each as defined above. The starting benzenesulfonyl halide compound VIA is obtainable by reacting 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyldiphenyl ether with chlorosulfonic acid or by reacting 2 chloro 4trifluoromethylphenoxybenzenesulfonic acid with a halogenating agent such as thionyl chloride or phosphorus pentachloride. The reaction between the 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethylphenoxybenzenesulfonyl halide IIA and the benzene compound IIIA may be carried out in the presence of aLewis acid as the catalyst, if necessary, in the coexistence of an inert solvent e.g. dichloroethane, nitrobenzene, carbon disulfide , usually at a temperature of 30 to 1500C, preferably of 50 to 1200C. Examples of the Lewis acid are anhydrous ferric chloride, anhydrous tin chloride, etc. The objective diphenyl sulfone compound tIA is obtainable in a good yield.

The reaction may be carried out by treatment of the diphenyl sulfide compound IIB with an oxidizing agent in an inert solvent e.g. acetic acid, acetone, water usually at a temperature of O to 1200C, preferably of 30 to 1000C. Examples of the oxidizing agent are hydrogen peroxide, manganese peroxide, organic peracids e.g. peracetic acid, m chloroperbenzoic acid , etc. The objective diphenyl sulfone compound IB is obtainable in a good yield. Procedure C A 1,3 diphenoxydiphenyl sulfone compound of the formula EMI7.1 wherein X3 is a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a lower alkyl group or a lower alkoxy group is reacted with an alkanol of the formula R1OH IIIc wherein R1 is a lower alkyl group in the presence of a base to give the diphenyl sulfone compound of the formula EMI7.2 wherein R1 and X3 are each as defined above.

Example I 2. Into polyethylene made pots of 70 cm in surface area, paddy field soil was filled. Seeds of barnyardgrass Panicum.crus galli and broad leaved weeds such.as mono. choria, false pimpernel, toothcup and Dopatrium junceum were mixed into the soil. The pots were flooded with water to make a paddy field condition. In each of the pots, two bulbs of arrowhead were planted. Then, rice plants at the two or three foliate stage were transplanted into the pots.Cultivation was carried out in a greenhouse at 25 to 300C.On the 2nd day after the transplantation, the test compound formulated in an emulsifiable concentrate and diluted with water was applied to the pots in an amount of 10 ml per pot by soil treatment. Cultivation was further continued in the greenhouse. On the 25th day from the soil treatment, the herbicidal effect and the phytotoxicity were determined on the following criteria Herbicidal effect Evaluation Prevention percentage O 0 19 1 20 39 2 40 59 3 60 79 4 80 99 5 100 completely dead Phytotoxicity to rice plants Evaluation Remarks o No phytotoxicity 1 Slight phytotoxicity observed but no material influence on growth 2 Growth once influenced but recovered no material reduction in crop 3 Growth and crop slightly influenced 4 Growth and crop influenced 5 Completely deadThe results are shown in Table 2.
