# Rotatable joint with face seal.

## Abstract
Two relatively rotatable members 11, 14 are sealed by a sealing assembly 21 mounted in a recess 15 in the member 11 . The sealing assembly consists of an annular metal dia phragm 22 consisting of a base portion 25 which is press fined into the recess, a flexible connecting portion 27 and a stiffener portion 26 . Moulded onto the annular diaphragm is a seal ring 23 which seals against the peripheral wall 20 of the recess, covers the diaphragm, and provides a sealing lip 31 which is urged against a confronting surface 18 of the second member 14 under the action of a Belleville spring 24 which acts between a flange 35 on the diaphragm and the stiffener portion 26 of the diaphragm.
