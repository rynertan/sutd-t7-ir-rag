## Description
SEBTTHESIS OF INOTROPIC IMIDAZO 4,5 clPYRIDINE The present invention relates to a process for preparing 2 2 methoxy 4 methylthio phenyl 1 3 H imidazo 4,5 c pyridine of the formulaeEMI1.1 comprising reacting 3,4 diaminopyridine with 2 methoxy4 methylthiobenzoic acid in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride and pyridine at a temperature of about 250C to about 1250C. All temperatures shall be reported herein as degrees Celsius. All units of measurement are reported in weight units, except for liquids, which are reported in volume units. The Formulae I and Ia set forth above represent tautomeric structures. The imidazopyridine having the hydrogen atom on the N l nitrogen atom and having the pyridine nitrogen atom at the 5 position is represented by the compound of Formula I and is properly named 2 2 methoxy 4 methylthio phenyl 3 1H imidazo 4r5 cjpyridine. This compound has a corresponding tautomeric form wherein the hydrogen atom is on the N 3 nitrogen atom Formula Ia and is named 2 2 methoxy 4 methylthio phenyl 3H Ã¬midazo L4 v 5 c i pyriaine. As N unsubstituted compounds, each tautomeric form exists in equilibrium with the other and cannot be prepared or isolated without the presence of the other.For this invention, both forms will be considered together and will be referred to as 2 2 methoxy 4 methylthio phenyl 1 3 H imidazo 4,5 c pyridine. The present invention relates to a process for preparing 2 2 methoxy 4 methyltho phenyl 1 3 H imidazo 4,5 cgpyridine comprising react 3 ,4 diamino pyridine with 2 methoxy 4 methylthiobenzoic acid in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride POCl3 and pyridine.This reaction is represented by the following scheme.EMI2.1 According to the present process, approximately equimolar quantities of 3,4 diaminopyridine and 2 methoxy 4 methylthiobenzoic acid are combined with pyridine in a suitable reaction vessel. The concentration of the starting materials in the pyridine is not critical, but it is preferred to employ a sufficient amount of solvent to keep the two reactants in solution, or a slight excess. Large volumes of solvent are neither necessary nor desirable in the present process. Phosphorus oxychloride is also present in the present process acting as a means of removing the water produced in the process. During the process two molar equivalents of water are generated for each molar equivalent of the limiting starting material present in the reaction mixture. Accordingly, at least two molar equivalents of phosphorus oxychloride are employed in the present process for each molar equivalent of the limiting starting material. Typically, excess amounts of phosphorus oxychloride are employed. The preferred amount of phosphorus oxychloride for use in the present process is about three molar equivalents. Phosphorus oxychloride also reacts with 2 methoxy 4 methylthiobenzoic acid to provide 2 methoxy 4 methylthiobenzoyl chloride, which then reacts with 3,4 diaminopyridine to give the desired product. Since phosphorus oxychloride reacts exothermically with water, it is preferred to add the solution of reactants in pyridine slowly to the solution of phosphorus oxychloride in order to better control the accompanying increase in temperature of the reaction. Pref erably each solution is heated to a temperature in he range of about GOC to about 50 C, more specifically at a temperature of about 500C prior to their combInation. The process of the present invention is substantially complete after about l to 24 hours when conducted at a temperature in the range of about 25 C to about 1250C, more preferably from about 500C to about 800C. Once the process of the present invention is substantially complete, the product may be isolated by combining the reaction mixture with a suitable base such as sodium hydroxide at a cold temperature, that is, in the range of about 20 C to about l50C. The volatile organic constituents are preferably removed by evaporation under vacuum. The product thus prepared is then isolated by vacuum filtration to afford the desired compound in sufficient purity for further synthetic modification without competing adverse side reactions. The product of the present process is typically isolated as the free base which is usually hydrated with one equivalent of water. Hcwever, the product may be isolated as the hydrochloride acid added tion salt, and dried to provide either the anhydrous form or a hydrated form of the molecule. Accordingly, the compounds of formulae I and Ia prepared by the present process encompass both the free base and the hydrochloric acid salt, in both the hydrated and anhydrous forms. The present process has been found to provide the desired compounds in high yield and in pure form. The present process is particularly advantageous due to its operability on a large scale thereby making it suitable for an industrial setting. Known procedures using phosphorus oxychloride do not employ pyridine.The reactions wherein pyridine is absent do not operate acceptably on a large scale because of the use of hot phosphorus oxychloride, which oftentimes results in an uncontrollable exotherm and partial loss of reactants.Pyridine permits the easy control of the present process to enable large scale operation. In the prior process, excess phosphorus oxychloride was difficult to remove even under vacuum, and the addition of water is exothermic and uncontrollable. Also, the pyridine employed in the present process neutralizes the hydrochloric acid which is formed. Accordingly, the product is much easier to isolate as compared with the prior process. The product of the present process, 2 2 methoxy 4 methylthio phenyl I 3 H imidazo 4, 5 c pyridine, may be used as an inotropic agent following isolation from the reaction mixture as described above.However, the product is preferably oxidized to the corresponding sulfoxide derivative, 2 2 methoxy 4 methylsulfinyl phenyl l 3 H imidazo 4,5 c pyridine, a preferred inotropic agent. The use of the product of the present process, and its sulfoxide derivative, is known. See, e.g.European Patent Applications 93,593, 79,083 and 72,926.The compounds are useful as orally effective positive inotropic agents and have minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate While a variety of methods may be employed to oxidize 2 C2 methoxy 4 methI thio phenll 1 3 imidazo L4, 5 c pyridine to 2 2 methoxy 4 methylsul finylphenyl 1 3 H imidazop4,5 cgpyriaine, the reaction is preferably conducted with aqueous hydrogen peroxide and glacial acetic acid. The reaction is conducted at a temperature in the range of about 00C to about 500C for about 1 to about 24 hours, more preferably at a temperature in the range of about 100C to about 300C for a period of about 2 to 10 hours. The product may then be economically and conveniently isolated by forcing the product to precipitate from solution by the addition of isopropanol.The product thus isolated is then collected by vacuum filtration and washed as desired to provide the sulfoxide. The sulfoxide thus prepared is finally converted to the hydrochloride salt according to standard procedures to provide the hydrochloride salt of the sulfoxide. The starting materials employed in the present process are known and either commercially available or readily prepared by procedures well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, 3,4 diamino pyridine may be purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwankee, Wisconsin. The compound 2 methoxy 4 methyl thiobenzonc acid may be purchased from 5SF Dottikon,Dottikon, Switzerland. The following Examples illustrate specific aspects of the present invention.
