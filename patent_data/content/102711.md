# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING FIBRE REINFORCED POLYMER COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
A process of producing a fibre reinforced composition comprising feeding a plurality of contiguous aligned fila ments in the form of a band to a spreader surface so as to form a nip between the band and the spreader surface, supplying a feed of thermoplastics polymer at the nip and impregnating the band of filaments with molten polymer characterised in that at least some of the heat input required to melt the polymer is supplied directly to the filaments. The process enables good impregnation to be achieved using a significantly lower energy input.
