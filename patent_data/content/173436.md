# Improvements in collation assemblies.

## Abstract
Apparatus for collating and stacking building components, for example titles T , has pairs of conveyors 104 with shelves 98 for supporting edges of tiles. The tiles are fed to the shelves by a conveyor 10 and the pairs of conveyors move upwardly in timed relation to locate tiles on the shelves. When all the shelves are full, the pairs of conveyors move downwards and apart to deposit the tiles in a stack on to a support 250, 252 . The timing of this avoids shock loads on the tiles. The stack of components is then banded and removed from the apparatus.
