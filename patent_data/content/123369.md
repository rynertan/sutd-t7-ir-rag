# Battery venting system.

## Abstract
An electric storage battery having a battery gas venting system 18 including an electrolyte trapping chamber 14 an exhaust port 16 for venting battery gases to the ambient atmosphere a porous flame arresting filter 24 between the electrolyte trapping chamber 14 and the port 16 a com bustion chamber 28 adjacent the exhaust port 16 for the controlled combustion of the battery gases a buffer chamber 26 intermediate the porous filter 24 and the combustion chamber 28 a partition 30 separating the combustion and buffer chambers and a relatively small aperture 32 com municating the combustion and buffer chambers one with the other. The aperture 32 between the buffer and combustion chambers preferably has an effective cross sectional area which is no more than about one half the cross sectional area of the exhaust port 16 .
