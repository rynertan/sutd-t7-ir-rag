## Description
Oxidation of Substituted Aromatic Compounds to Art attic Carboxylic Acids THE PRESENT INVENTION relates to the oxidation of substituted aromatic compounds to aromatic carboxylic acids. Aromatic carboxylic acids are important chemical products, the dibasic acids in particular finding a major outlet in the resin and plastic industry. Terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid are important examples of this latter class of compounds and they are commonly produced by the oxidation of the corresponding xylene p xylene and m xylene respectively . The oxidation is carried out using molecular oxygen in the presence of a catalyst, the most widely used being a heavy metal such as cobalt in conjunction with bromine or a bromine containing compound. The solvent for the catalyst and reactants is usually a lower alkanoic acid, acetic acid being almost universally used. An alkanoic acid such as acetic acid although providing an effective solvent has the disadvantage of susceptibility to oxidation which means that solvent is lost as oxides of carbon and must be replaced.The replacement is a significant item in the overall cost of the process. It would be a substantial step forward in the technology of aromatic carboxylic acid production if water could be used as all or as a substantial part of the reaction medium because it is cheap and not susceptible to oxidation. Unfortunately, under the reaction conditions and with the catalyst usually used in the acetic acidsolvent process the use of water as solvent gives a process with very poor yield of an inferior product. The effect of the present invention is so to select the conditions under which the process is operated, particularly with respect to temperature and choice of catalyst, that water may be used as solvent and an acceptable product obtained. Accordingly, the invention is a process for the production of an aromatic carboxylic acid which comprises oxidising by means of molecular oxygen a substituted aromatic compound in the presence of a catalyst comprising a heavy metal compound and bromine or a brominecontaining compound, characterised in that the oxidation is carried out in an essentially aqueous reaction medium at a temperature in the range 200 to 3000C and using a catalyst comprising manganese alone or manganese and a lesser amount of one or more other heavy metals. Preferably the temperature is 2100C to 2600C. The atomic ratio of manganese to other heavy metals is preferably 3 1 to 20 1 more preferably 4 1 to 10 1. The amount of manganese present during the oxidation is subject to wide variation but may lie in the range 20 to 20,000 ppm based on solvent preferably 1000 to 10,000 ppm.The amounts of any heavy metals other than manganese which may be present e.g. vanadium, chromium, iron, molybdenum, a lanthanide e.g.cerium, zirconium, hafnium and, particularly, cobalt and or nickel may lie in the range 10 to 6,000 ppm based on solvent, particularly 100 to 2,000 ppm. The heavy metals may be used, for example, in the form of their inorganic or organic acid salts especially the bromides or lower C1 to C4 alkanoates e.g. acetates. The catalyst also comprises bromine or a bromine containing compound which acts as an oxidation promoter. The bromine may be provided as bromine itself, as hydrogen bromide, as an organic bromine compound e.g. tetrabromoethane or as an inorganic bromide.Suitable bromides, include, for example, bromides of manganese and or other heavy metal s . The amount of bromine present in the process may vary widely but generally lies in the range 500 to 50,000 ppm based on the weight of solvent. Preferably the bromine is provided as hydrogen bromide. The solvent used in the process is essentially water. When p xylene is the substituted aromatic compound terephthalic acid may be provided as solubilising agent before the start of the oxidation reaction but as the reaction proceeds the terephthalic acid which is produced fulfills this function. The pressure under which the process is operated is at least such that a liquid phase is maintained in the reactor and is, for example, up to 200 bar preferably 15 to 150 bar. The molecular oxygen used in the process may be used alone or in admixture with other gases e.g. as air or as a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen with a higher or lower oxygen content than that of air. The aromatic compound is preferably substituted by an alkyl, hyroxyalkyl, or a formyl group. Particularly suitable alkyl groups are lower C1 to C0 alkyl groups e.g. methyl, ethyl and isopropyl groups. Particularly suitable hydro cyal cyl groups are hydroxymethyl groups. One, two or more such groups may be present in the aromatic nucleus and the groups may be the same of different. The aromatic nucleus may, for example, be a benzene or naphthalene nucleus.Particularly suitable aromatic compounds to be oxidised are toluene, ethylbenzene, isopropylbenzene, o , m and p xylene, cumene, pseudocumene, the isomeric diisopropylbenzenes, durene, mesitylene, hydroxymethylbenzene, hydroxyethylbenzene, bis hydroxy methylbenzenes, benzaldehyde and 2,6 dimethylnaphthalene. Suitable aromatic compounds also include those which are already partially oxidised to carboxylic acids and their corresponding esters, for example, the isomeric tolualdehydessp toluic acid, methyl p toluate and p carboxybenzaldehyde, The process of our invention is particularly suitable for the oxidation of p xylene, p tolualdehyde or p toluic acid to terephthalic acid. The separation and purification of the aromatic dibasic acid product of the process may be carried out by known means. Thus the product may be cooled, separated by filtration or by centrifuging and washed with fresh solvent. It may also be subject to a secondary or post oxidation to improve its quality and or it may be catalytically hydrogenated in the presence of a catalyst e.g.platinum to achieve the same object. The invention will now be further described with reference to the following examples in which the apparatus used comprised a titanium autoclave of total capacity 4.5 litres, equipped with a heater, reflux condenser, agitator, gas inlet and outlet, and feed inlet and outlet. The purity of the terephthalic acid product of the process described in the Examples was assessed by measuring its 4 carboxybenzaldehyde content, the latter compound being an intermediate oxidation product ExMtPLES 1 9 54 g p toluic acid was charged to the autoclave along with 1800 ml water, 9.2 ml of 477 w w aqueous HBr and various amounts of cobalt dibromide hexahydrate, manganese dibromide tetrahydrate and nickel dibromide trihydrate to give the metal concentrations indicated in the table. The reaction mixture was then heated under a nitrogen atmosphere to 2150C and a total pressure of 34.5 bar. A mixture of 307. oxygen in nitrogen was then passed through the autoclave at a total flow rate of about 700 1 per hour measured atSTP . After 30 minutes oxidation, a small sample of the reaction mixture was removed from the autoclave. The oxidation was continued for a further 30 minutes and another sample of reaction mixture removed from the autoclave. The samples of reaction mixture were cooled to ambient temperature and the product filtered, washed with water and dried. The dried products were analysed and found to contain the 4 carboxybenzaldehyde 4CBA levels given in the table.EMI4.1 tb SEP Catalyst SEP Metal SEP Levels SEP 4CBA SEP Content SEP of tb SEP in SEP Mother SEP Liquor SEP TA SEP Product tb Example SEP SEP in SEP other SEP Liquor SEP TA SEP Product SEP tb SEP No. tb SEP Mn SEP Co SEP Ni SEP After SEP 30 SEP min SEP After SEP 60 SEP min tb SEP ppm SEP ppm SEP ppm SEP oxidation SEP oxidation tb SEP wt.
