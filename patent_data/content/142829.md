# Method of producing a high purity aluminum lithium mother alloy.

## Abstract
A method of producing high purity aluminum lithium mother alloys essentially free from other alkali metals than lithium, which comprises electroyzing a mixed molten salts consisting of 34 to 64 wt. of lithium chloride and 66 to 36 wt. of potassium chloride, and, optionally, 1 to 20 wt. of sodium chloride based on a combined weight of the aforesaid two components, using solid aluminum as cathodes, and an α β phase aluminum lithium alloy electrode or the alloy coated electrode electrode as the reference electrode, under a current density in the range of 0.005 to 1 A cm², whereby producing aluminum lithium alloys on the cathode. During electrolysing, the potential difference between the cathode and the reference electrode is continuously measured and differenticated with respect to time and at the point of a sud den change in the differentiated value, electrolysing is stop ped.
