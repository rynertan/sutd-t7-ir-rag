# Nozzle for a jet printer and method of producing same.

## Abstract
The invention provides a nozzle for a jet printer and a method of producing same. The nozzle of the invention comprises a housing 1 having an inlet 2 connectable to a source of liquid under pressure and an outlet orifice 3 . The housing 1 comprises an inlet portion 4 and an outlet portion 5 which makes screw threaded or other engagement with the inlet portion 4 whereby the portions 4,5 can be adjusted relative to one another to vary the length of the liquid path between the inlet 2 and the outlet orifice 3 . Vibrating means 8 is provided for applying regular pulses to a stream of liquid issuing from the outlet orifice 3 to cause the stream to break up into drops of repeatable size and spacing. Preferably the housing portions 4,5 are adjusted to adjust the resonant length of the liquid path to the resonant frequency of the vibrating means 8 .
