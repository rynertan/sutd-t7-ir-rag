# ENVELOPE LABELING DEVICE

## Abstract
A label having an adhesive coating and peelably attached to a web of paper is printed by a printer and then peeled off the web of paper by a catching finger mounted on a labeler, which is then angularly moved toward a labeling table. A hammer is raised toward the labeler to apply the label to an envelope supplied to the labeling table.
