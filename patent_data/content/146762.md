# Optical Head.

## Abstract
In an optical head, a semiconductor laser 30 is supported on a base 72 and the base 72 is secured to a hollow frame 74 . A lens barrel 76 for supporting collima tor lens system 32, 34 is disposed in the hollow frame 74 so that the collimator lens system 32, 34 is faced to the semiconductor laser 30 . The frame 74 and lens barrel 76 are secured in point contact securement to each other by studs screwed in dies provided on the frame 74 . The base 72 , lens barrel 76 and frame 74 are made of materials having linear expansion coefficients satisfying either one of inequalities α γ β and β γ α, where α, β and γ are linear expansion coefficients of the base 72 , frame 74 and lens barrel 76 respectively.
