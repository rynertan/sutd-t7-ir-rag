## Description
This invention relates to an apparatus for autmatically winding continuously fed web of e.g. flexible foamed rubber onto a tubular take up member. A web made of flexible foamed rubber, such as urethane foamed rubber, is stored and conveyed by being wound on a tubular member, made of paper, for convenience in handling. Normally, this web is continuously formed in that an elongated block of flexible foamed rubber is levelled into a predetermined thickness of material by means of a blade while it is being moved. As this web is supplied continuously, winding thereof onto a tubular member is preferably effected automatically by a machine. Various winding apparatus have been proposed so far. However, several types of webs are often produced on a same manufacture line and the conventional apparatus cannot deal properly with such conditions. DE U 7,640,482 discloses a device for winding up veneer, which is a rather brittle material tending to break when being pulled around the take up member or roll. Consequently, the means for turning over the forward end of this material consist of a roll chain with a plurality of rolls, which roll chain contacts the material continuously, while it is wound up. Such apparatus would not be applicable to rather soft webs, since the weight of the roll chain resting on the empty take up member would prevent proper threading of the web. DE U 1,889,677 discloses a device for alternatingly winding a web onto two different take up rolls in a quasi continuous operation, comprising a pressing element for pushing the forward end of a web turned over a take up member into contact between the arriving web and the take up member. No means are disclosed how the forward end of the web is wound around one of the take up members at the beginning of the operation. It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus for automatically winding webs of different materials onto take up rolls. In order to resolve such problems as described above, the present invention provides an apparatus as characterized in claim 1. Now, the present invention will be described in connection with a preferred embodiment thereof illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The drawings show a preferred embodiment of the present invention, and in the drawings, Fig. 1 is a perspective view of essential part of a winding apparatus, and Figs. 2 to 5 are side elevational views, in schematic representation of the winding apparatus, illustrating various stages of winding a sheet formed article. A continuously fed sheet formed article 11 of flexible foamed rubber such as urethane foamed rubber is transported across a winding apparatus by a conveyor 10 as a belt 16 extending between a driving drum 12 and a rotary drum 14 of the conveyor 10 is circulated. A transmission roller 18 is supported for movement around the driving drum 12 by means of an arm 17 and has two belt receiving portions 20 and 22. A belt 23 extends between the belt receiving portion 20 of the transmission roller 18 and the driving drum 20 so that the transmission roller 18 may be rotated in the same direction with the driving drum 12. An attaching roller assembly 24 includes a jumping roller 26 and a backup roller 28 supported for rotation in a spaced relationship on a pair of arms 30 and 32. The two rollers 26 and 28 are connected to rotate in the same direction by a belt 33. The backup roller 28 is connected to the belt receiving portion 22 of the transmission roller 18 by another belt 34. Accordingly, the jumping roller 26 and the backup roller 28 are rotated in the same direction with the transmission drum 18 and hence with the driving drum 12. The attaching roller assembly 24 can be moved between a position forwardly of the driving drum 12 and another position above the driving drum 12 by expansion and contraction of a pair of jumping cylinders 36 and 37 connected to the jumping roller 26. The jumping cylinders 36 and 37 may be connected to the jumping roller 26 by means of rings or the like so that they may not prevent rotation of the jumping roller 26. A tubular takeup member 38 in the form of a paper tube or the like for winding a sheet formed article 11 thereon is mounted for movement from and toward the conveyor belt 16 up and down movement in the arrangement shown and for rotation on and between a pair of arms 40 and 42 which are vertically adjustably secured to a frame not shown . The lowermost position of the tubular takeup member 38 is adjusted in accordance with a thickness of a sheet formed article by up or down movement of the arms 40 and 42. A presser 44 is connected to a presser cylinder 46 such that it may be extended in an inclined direction toward a position below the tubular takeup member 38. Now, description will be given of winding of a sheet formed article. A sheet formed article 11 which is supplied continuously from a sheet formed article forming apparatus not shown is transported toward the tubular takeup member 38 on the winding apparatus by the conveyor 10 as seen in Fig. 2. At this instant, the jumping cylinders 36 and 37 are in their expanded positions and the attaching roller assembly 24 is at a position forwardly of the driving drum 12 and hence below the sheet formed article 11. The tubular takeup member 38 is secured to a position in which it is spaced from the conveyor belt 16 by a distance equal to or a little smaller than the thickness of the sheet formed article 11. When the sheet formed article 11 is further transported until an end 11a thereof extends a predetermined length forwardly from the tubular takeup member 38, preferably until the length of the extended end 11a from the tubular takeup member 38 becomes a little greater than the circumference of the tubular takeup member 38, the length is detected by means of a detecting device using an infrared ray or the like. As a result, the cylinders 36 and 37 are contracted as seen in Fig. 3 and the attaching roller assembly 24 is jumped up above the driving drum 12. Thereupon, an end portion of the sheet formed article 11 is jumped up by the jumping roller 26 and is then pressed against the outer periphery of the tubular takeup member 38 by the reversing roller 26 and the backup roller 28 so that it surrounds a forward half peripheral portion of the tubular takeup member 38 and is turned over rearwardly. Then, when the turned over end 11a of the sheet formed article 11 comes to a predetermined position, it is detected by a detecting device and the presser cylinder 46 is operated to expand itself until the presser 44 located at the end of the presser cylinder 46 pushes the end portion 11a of the sheet formed article 11 to a position below the tubular takeup member 38 as seen in Fig. 4. Meanwhile, since the sheet formed article 11 is continuously transported by the conveyor 10 and a portion near the end of thereof is pressed against the outer periphery of the tubular takeup member 38, a rotational force is applied to the tubular takeup member 38 in accordance with transportation of the sheet formed article 11 by the conveyor 10 and the attaching roller assembly 24 so that the tubular takeup member 38 is rotated in integral relationship with the end of the sheet formed article 11. Then, the end 11a of the sheet formed article 11 is wrapped between the tubular takeup member 38 and the sheet formed article 11 on the conveyor 10, thereby completing attaching of the sheet formed article 11 to the tubular takeup member 38.. After completion of attaching, the jumping cylinders 36 and 37 are expanded again so that the attaching roller assembly 24 is moved back to the initial position forwardly of the driving drum 12. Then, the presser cylinder 46 is contracted so that the presser 44 is removed from the position below the tubular takeup member 38 and is moved to a position as seen in Fig. 5 in which it does not interfere with winding of the sheet formed article 11. In this case, the tubular takeup member 38 is contacted with the belt 16 of the conveyor 10 via the sheet formed article 11 wrapped around the tubular takeup member 38 and is thus transported continuously thereby. Accordingly, the tubular takeup member 38 is rotated at a rotational speed equal to the transporting speed of the sheet formed article 11, effecting continuous winding of the sheet formed article 11. Since the tubular takeup member 38 is mounted for movement from and toward the belt 16 of the conveyor 10, it moves upwardly over the driving drum 12 in accordance with the progressively increasing thickness of the sheet formed article 11 wound in layers around the tubular takeup member 38 as winding of the sheet formed article 11 proceeds. As apparent from the foregoing description, according to the invention, a winding apparatus is constituted such that an end portion of a sheet formed article which is continuously transported by a conveyor is turned over to surround a substantially half peripheral portion of a tubular takeup member by means of an attaching roller assembly so that the sheet formed article is pressed against the tubular takeup member and then the turned over end of the sheet formed article is pushed to a position below the tubular takeup member by means of a presser so as to allow automatic winding of the sheet formed article onto the tubular takeup member to be effected by rotation of the tubular takeup member. The winding apparatus of the invention can be accommodated to any change of the thickness of the sheet formed article by varying the lowermost position of the tubular takeup member, that is, the distance from a conveyor belt, when the sheet formed article is to be attached to the tubular takeup member. Meanwhile, the maximum width of sheet formed articles to be wound by the winding apparatus is only limited by the width of the conveyor belt, the width of each roller, and so on. Accordingly, so far as the width of sheet formed articles is within a predetermined fixed range, automatic winding can be continued even if a sheet formed article of a different thickness or width is to be subsequently wound. Also in the case the thickness and width of a sheet formed article to be wound vary continuously, automatic winding is also possible only by adjustment of the lowermost position of the tubular takeup member, that is, the distance from the conveyor belt. As apparent from the foregoing description, a winding apparatus according to the present invention allows automatic winding without being influenced by a material or dimensions of a sheet formed article to be wound and is thus very effective for industrial applications.
