# A METHOD APPARATUS FOR TRANSFERRING DATA FROM A SMALLER TO A LARGER REGISTER

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for transferring data in parallel from a smaller to a larger register is described, in which the larger register comprises a first and a second set of master and slave latches with a one shot employed for clocking the master latches in the first set. In operation, a first word from the smaller register is latched into the first set of master latches in response to an output from the one shot which occurs on the trailing edge of a clock pulse applied to the larger register. On the leading edge of a subsequent clock pulse applied to the larger register, a second data word is latched in the second set of master latches. Immediately thereafter the first and the second set of slave latches are opened for transferring the first and second words at their inputs to their outputs in parallel. Following the transfer of the first and second words to the outputs of the first and second set of slave latches, the slave latches close, latching the first and second words. Immediately thereafter the first and second master latches open to begin the next cycle of data transfer.
