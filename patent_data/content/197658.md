## Abstract
A solid state relay is responsive to a control signal and is used with an impedance load and a source of alternating electrical power. The solid state relay is used to connect and disconnect the load from the source of alternating electrical power. The solid state relay turns on in response to a control signal and to a substantially zero voltage crossing of the alternating electrical power of the source. The solid state relay turns off in response to the control signal and to a substantially zero current crossing of the alternating electric al power of the source.
