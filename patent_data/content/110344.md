## Description
NONAQUEOUS CELLS Field of the Invention The invention relates to a nonaqueous cell comprising an active anode, a nonaqueous electrolyte solution based on at least one organic solvent and a solid cathode comprising manganese dioxide, a binder and a conductive agent.Background of the Invention The development of high energy battery systems requires the compatibility of an electrolyte possessing desirable electrochemical properties with highly reactive anode materials, such as lithium, sodium and the like, and the efficient use of high energy density cathode materials, such as manganese dioxide. The use of aqueous electrolytes is precluded in these systems since the anode materials are sufficiently active to react with water chemically. it has, therefore, been necessary, in order to realize the high energy density obtainable through use of these highly reactive anodes and high energy density cathodes, to turn to the investigation of nonaqueous electrolyte systems and more particularly to nonaqueous electrolyte systems based on organic solvents. The term 1nonaqueous electrolyte1 in the prior art refers to an electrolyte which is composed of a solute, for example, a salt or a complex salt of Group I A, Group II A or Group III A elements of the Periodic Table, dissolved in an appropriate ,nonaqueous organic solvent. Conventional solvents include propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate or butyrolactone. The term Periodic Table as used herein refers to the Periodic Table of theElements as set forth on the inside back cover of the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 60th Edition,CRC Press Inc., Boca Baton, Florida, 1979 1980. Although manganese dioxide has been mentioned as a cathode for cell applications, manganese dioxide inherently contains an unacceptable amount of water, both of the adsorbed and bound absorbed types, which is sufficient to cause anode lithium corrosion along with its associated hydrogen evolution. This type of corrosion that causes gas evolution is a serious problem in sealed cells, particularly in miniature type button cells. In order to maintain battery powered electronic devices as compact as possible, the electronic devices are usually designed with cavities to accommodate the miniature cells as their power source. The cavities are usually made so that a cell can be snugly positioned therein thus making electronic contact with appropriate terminals within the device.A major potential problem in the use of cell powered devices of this nature is that if the gas evolution causes the cell to bulge then the cell could become wedged within the cavity. This could result in damage to the device. Also, if electrolyte leaks from the cell it could cause damage to the device. It is therefore important that the physical dimensions of the cell s housing remain constant during discharge and that the cell will not leak any electrolyte into the device being powered. In order to reduce the water content in manganese dioxide, several process have been developed. For example, US A 4,133,856 discloses a process for producing an MnO2 electrode cathode for nonaqueous cells whereby the XnO2 is initially heated within a range of 350 C to 1300C so as to substantially remove both the adsorbed and bound water and then, after being formed into an electrode with a conductive agent and binder, it is further heated in a range of 2000C to 3500C prior to its assembly into a cell. BritishPatent 1,199,426 also discloses the heat treatment of MnO2 in air at 2500C to 450 C to substantially remove its water component. US A 4,133,856 discloses a process whereby a homogeneous mass of particulate manganese dioxide is heat treated and then contacted with an organic solvent that substantially fills the pores of the manganese dioxide with a layer of the organic solvent which effectively decreases the affinity or propensity of the manganese dioxide for readsorbing moisture. German patent application , DE A 31 12 454 discloses a process whereby the walls of the pores of manganese dioxide are coated by vapor depositing an organic solvent thereon to reduce the manganese dioxide s affinity for adsorbing moisture when exposed to a moisture containing environment for a fixed time period. Although manganese dioxide with reduced water content is better suited for nonaqueous cell systems, it was noted that cells employing this type of active material had a tendency to show increased internal impedance during storage. This condition is accompanied by poor closed circuit voltage, poor high and low temperature shelf life, poor cell voltage maintenance characteristics, poor pulse rate discharge capabilities, etc. It is an object of the present invention to provide a nonaqueous cell employing among other components a manganese dioxide containing solid cathode having a minor amount of an alkaline earth metal hydroxide and or carbonate to suppress or minimize the increase in the internal impedance of the cell which may occur during storage or discharge. Another object of the present invention is to provide a manganese dioxide containing nonaqueous cell having good voltage maintenance and pulse discharge characteristics even after prolonged storage. The foregoing and additional objects will become more fully apparent from the following description.Summary of the Invention The invention is directed to a nonaqueous cell comprising an active anode, a nonaqueous electrolyte solution based on at least one organic solvent and a solid cathode comprising manganese dioxide, a binder and a conductive agent, the improvement wherein the cathode contains at least one compound selected from the group consisting of alkaline earth metal hydroxides such as Mg OH 2, Ca OH 2, Ba OH 2 and Sr OH 2 and alkaline earth metal carbonates, such as MgCO3, CaCO3, BaC03 and SrCO3. Although not wishing to be held to any theory, it is believed that electrolyte degradation occurs in MnO2 containing nonaqueous cells due to the reaction of surface acidic groups on the MnO2 with the organic solvent of the electrolyte. Also, the use of incompletely neutralized salts in preparing the electrolyte solution may also introduce acidic impurities. Moreover, because of the relatively high solubility of these compounds in non aqueous electrolytes, the addition of the selected alkaline earth metal hydroxide and or carbonate is believed to react with the acidic impurities in the cell to neutralize them. This addition to the cell s cathode will effectively suppress build up of internal impedance of the cell which could be caused by electrolyte degradation. The alkaline earth metal compound additive should be incorporated in the MnO2 containing cathode by an amount between about 0.05 and about 10 weight percent based on the dry weight of the cathode, preferably, between about 0.1 and about 3 weight percent and more preferably about 1 weight percent. An amount of the alkaline earth metal compound additive below 0.05 weight percent will not provide sufficierft basicity to effectively neutralize acidic impurities in the cell for the reason discussed above. An amount of the alkaline earth metal compound additive above 10 weight percent would generally provide an excess of basicity for neutralizing the acidic impurities for most cell applications while also decreasing the volume for the active cathode material for given size cells. It will be appreciated that the range of the additive will also depend upon the basicity of the alkaline earth metal compound selected and the type of manganese dioxide employed. Of the alkaline earth metal compounds suitable for this invention, Ca OS 2 and CaC03 are the most preferred. The alkaline earth metal compound additive can be blended directly with the dry cathode mix or it can be added during the aqueous processing of the wet cathode mix. When blended with the dry cathode mix, the alkaline earth metal compound may be selected from alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates and mixtures thereof. The dry mix is then molded into cathode pellets using conventional techniques. When the alkaline earth metal compound additive is added to the wet cathode mix, it may be added in the form of alkaline earth metal hydroxide or carbonate or in the form of an alkaline earth metal compound which will form a hydroxide and or carbonate in an aqueous solution. For example, when alkaline earth metal oxide is added to water its hydration to alkaline earth metal hydroxide is virtually complete. Moreover, a proportion of alkaline earth metal hydroxide, when in aqueous solution, will react with carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere to form alkaline earth metal carbonate. Thus, the initial use of the oxide or hydroxide form in such a wet process may result in a product that is at least part carbonate. A drying step will be required before the cathode mix can be molded. The water inherently contained in both electrolytic and chemical types of manganese dioxide can be substantially removed by various treatments.For example, the manganese dioxide can be heated in air or an inert atmosphere at a temperature of 350etc for about 8 hours or at a lower temperature for a longer period of time. Care should be taken to avoid heating the manganese dioxide above its decomposition temperature which is about OOC in air. In oxygen atmospheres, higher temperatures may be employed. Preferably, the manganese dioxide should be heat treated to remove its water content in the crystal lattice to below about 1 weight percent and then it can be mixed with a conductive agent such as graphite, carbon or the like and a binder such aTeflon trademark for polytetrafluoroethylene , ethylene acrylic acid copolymer or the like to produce a solid cathode. If desired, a small amount of the electrolyte can be incorporated into the manganese dioxide mix. An added possible benefit in the removal of substantially all the water from manganese dioxide is that if small amounts of water are present in the cell s electrolyte then the manganese dioxide will adsorb the main portion of that water from the electrolyte and thereby prevent or substantially delay the reaction of the water with the anode such as lithium. In this situation, the manganese dioxide will act as an extracting agent for the water impurities in the organic solvents. Useful highly active metal anode materials include aluminum, the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and alloys of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals with each other and other metals. The term alloys as used herein and in the appended claims is intended to include mixtures, solid solutions, such as lithium magnesium, and intermetallic compounds, such as lithium monoaluminide. The preferred anode materials are lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium and alloys thereof.

Of the preferred solvents, the best are sulfolane 3 methyl 2 oxazolidone propylene carbonate 1,1and 1,2 dimethoxyethane, and 1,3 dioxolane because they appear more chemically inert to battery components and have wide liquid ranges, and especially because they permit highly efficient utilization of the cathode materials. The best electrolyte for use in this invention is a 3 methyl 2 oxazolidone based electrolyte. Liquid organic 3 methyl 2 oxazolidone, 3Me20x CH2 CH2 O CO N CH3, is an excellent nonaqueous solvent because of its high dielectric constant, chemical inertness to battery components, wide liquid range and low toxicity. However, it has been found that when metal salts are dissolved in liquid 3Me2Ox for the purpose of improving the conductivity of 3Me2Ox, the viscosity of the solution may be too high for its efficient use as an electrolyte for some nonaqueous cell applications other than those requiring very low current drains. Thus, in some applications in accordance with this invention, the addition of a low viscosity cosolvent would be desirable if 3Me2Ox is to be used as an electrolyte for nonaqueous cells which can operate or perform at a high energy density level. The low viscosity cosolvents which can be used along with 3Me20x include tetrahydrofuran THF , methyl substituted tetrahydrofuran Met ThF , dioxolane DIOX , dimethoxyethane DME , dimethyl isoxazole DM1 , diethyl carbonate DEC , ethylene glycol sulfite EGS , dioxane, dimethyl sulfite DMS or the like. Dimethoxyethane DME , and dioxolane DIOX are preferred cosolvents because of their compatibility with metal salts dissolved in liquid 3Me20x and their chemical inertness to cell components. Specifically, the total amount of the low viscosity cosolvent added could be between about 20 and about 80 based on total solvent volume, i.e., exclusive of salute, so as to lower the viscosity to a level suitable for use in a high drain cell. The ionizing solute for use in the invention may be a simple or double salt or mixtures thereof, for example, LiCF3SO3, LIBS, and Lilo4 which will produce an ionically conductive solution when dissolved in one or more solvents.Preferred solutes are complexes of inorganic or organic Lewis acids and inorganic ionizable salts.The only requirements for utility are that the salts, whether simple or complex, be compatible with the solvent or solvents being employed and that they yield a solution which is sufficiently ionically conductive. According to the Lewis or electronic concept of acids and bases, many substances which contain no active hydrogen can act as acids or acceptors of electron doublets. The basic concept is set forth in the chemical literature Journal of the Franklin Institute, Vol. 226 July December, 1938, pages 293 313 by G.N Lewis . A suggested reaction mechanism for the manner in which these complexes function in a solvent is described in detail in U.s. Patent No.3,542,602 wherein it is suggested that the complex or double salt formed between the Lewis acid and the ionizable salt yields an entity which is more stable than either of the components alone. Typical Lewis acids suitable for use in the present invention include aluminum fluoride, aluminum bromide, aluminum chloride, antimony pentachloride, zirconium tetrachloride, phosphorus pentachloride, boron fluoride, boron chloride and boron bromide. Ionizable salts useful in combination with the Lewis acids include lithium fluoride, lithium chloride, lithium bromide, lithium sulfide, sodium fluoride, sodium chloride, sodium bromide, potassium fluoride, potassium chloride and potassium bromide. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the double salts formed by a Lewis acid and an inorganic ionizable salt may be used as such or the individual components may be added to the solvent separately to form the double salt or the resulting ions in situ. One such double salt, for example, is that formed by the combination or aluminum chloride and lithium chloride to yield lithium aluminum tetrachloride.
