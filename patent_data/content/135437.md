# Sinusoidal signal generator, the frequency of which is dependent upon a binary signal, in particular for a modem.

## Abstract
A sinusoidal signal generator having a frequency vari able as a function of a selection signal applied to the generator. A clock generator 1,2 is programmable as a function of the selection signal and adapted to provide a plurality of clock signals having variable frequencies. A D A convertor 7 generates from a difference fixed potential V
