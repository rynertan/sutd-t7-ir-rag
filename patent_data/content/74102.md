# Chemical analyzer equipped with reagent cold storage chamber.

## Abstract
A chemical analyzer is disclosed in which a sample is supplied from a sample cup 12, 13 on a sample table 11 to an array of reaction cups 22 on a reaction table 21 so that the reaction cups contain the same amount of sample, a reagent pipetting nozzle 38, 39 sucks an appropriate reagent solution from an array of reagent tanks 31, 33 and discharges the reagent solution into a corresponding reac tion cup, the sample having reacted with the reagent solution is optically measured by a multi wavelength photometer 27 , a plurality of reagent tanks 31, 33 containing different reagent solutions are placed in a refrigerator 30 with the openings 32, 34 of the reagent tanks being directed upward, the refrigerator 30 is provided with a cover which has holes provided at positions corresponding to the openings 32, 34 of the reagent tanks 31, 33 , these holes are closed by a shutter except when the reagent pipetting nozzle 38, 39 is inserted into these holes, the array of reaction cups 22 is immersed in constant temperature water contained in a reaction bath 23 , the reaction bath 23 is supplied with water which is kept at 37 C in a liquid bath 29 by means of an evaporator 291 and a heater 292 , and a refrigerant from a refrigerating machine 80 passes through an evaporator 301 provided in the refrigerator 30 and the evaporator 291 provided in the liquid bath 29 to be returned to the refrigerating machine 80 .
