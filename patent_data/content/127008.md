# Multi port register implementations.

## Abstract
The present invention is especially directed towards an improved means 24 26 for comparing the address inputs P1 P3 of word decoders 12 14 in a memory array 10 such that, when a compare occurs, selected ones 13 and or 14 of the array word decoders are disabled to prevent a multiple read of identical cells 11 , and selected higher order read heads 22 and or 23 are inhibited while switching the output data onto all of the output lines having the same address as the uninhibited word decoder. The comparator circuit 24, 25, 26 employs a ripple effect and comprises a plurality of exclusive OR circuits 69, 69a, 69b interposed with source follower circuits 72, 73 . Each of the first and last steps of the comparator is an exclusive OR circuit. The comparator circuit is extendable to any size system and results in better power performance as well as a smaller size of the array.
