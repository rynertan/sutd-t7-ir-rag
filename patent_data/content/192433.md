# Optical head for optical data storage and readout.

## Abstract
An optical head 10 for optical storage and readout of information on or from an optical recording medium, by means of emission of a light beam, comprising a single substrate having a waveguide on one of its opposite surfaces, a deflector portion 14 disposed on the substrate to deflect the light beam passing through the waveguide, at an adjustable angle, and a converging portion 16 for converg ing the light beam to be emitted from the waveguide. The converging portion 16 comprises a plurality of convergence electrodes 33 which are disposed on a part of the wave guide. The plurality of convergence electrodes 33 are spaced apart from each other in a direction perpendicular to a direction of propagation of the light beam through the part of the waveguide, such that the part of the waveguide is given, by means of a photoelectric effect, a distribution of refractive index which permits adjustment of a focal point of the converged light beam.
