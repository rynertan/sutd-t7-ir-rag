# Process for the production of sulphenamides.

## Abstract
Benzothiazole 2 sulphenamides are prepared by react ing a 1 mercaptobenzothiazole and a primary or secondary amine with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst, for example a metal phthalocyanine, in a reaction medium consisting of i a mixture of the amine and water in which the amount of water at the outset of the reaction is from 0.2 to 20 of the weight of the mixture, or ii a mixture as defined in i diluted with an inert organic solvent miscible with the mixture, in a proportion of up to two parts by weight of the inert organic solvent per part by weight of the mixture.
