## Description
Improvements relating to manufacture of animal feedstuffsThe invention relates to the manufacture of animal feedstuffs, and particularly to the manufacture of feedstuff blocks which can be eaten by animals and yet are stable in damp conditions and nutritionally valuable.UK Patent Application No. 2,013,471A relates to the preparation of feedstuff blocks which utilise a urea formaldehyde resin as binder and which are cast in a mould. However, we have found that the process for making the blocks which is described in that specification does not facilitate commercial production of blocks since when all the ingredients required to produce a nutritionally balanced block are present, the simple mixing process described in that specification does not produce a satisfactory product.In a feedstuff block a desirable component is magnesium, which is conveniently added as the oxide, but unfortunately magnesium oxide is a strong base and reacts violently with the acid catalyst required to harden urea formaldehyde resin binder. In the process described in UK 2,013,471A this is liable to melt the plastic bowl used due to overheating in patches as a result of rapid reaction occurring before the reactants can be adequately dispersed in the inert diluents. This gives rise to uneven hardening, reduce binder efficiency, renders uniform dispersion impossible and is liable to make the mixture impourable before it is mixed, and in any event will produce a block of poor integrity.We have now devised a process which copes with these difficulties.According to the present invention a process for the manufacture of feedstuff blocks comprises preparing two components to be mixed, one of which is acidic, and the other contains a urea formaldehyde resin and a base to exotherm with the acid, either or both components being a slurry containing solid nutrients and both components being sufficiently liquid to be pumpable, pumping said components in two streams, intimately mixing the two streams and casting or extruding the resultant reacting mixture into the desired form.In this process the intimate pre mixture of resin or acid with nutrient solids, followed by rapid mixing of flowing streams of components produces a homogeneous product but enables the exotherm to be controlled and utilized to accelerate the cure of the resin binder without degradation.As indicated above either or both the components may contain nutrient solids. The extent of the exotherm can be controlled by pre mixing some of the base with the acidic stream prior to the mixing of the two components so that this heat is dissipated of reaction so produced to dissipated before the two components are mixed together. There is no constraint on the type of urea formaldehyde resin used, and liquid or solid resins can be utilized in the process. The amount of resin used in the blocks will generally be above about 5 to ensure good binding and below about 40 to make sure th blocks are not too hard.The other components of the blocks may be selected from materials conventionally used for such purposes which may be organic for example, molasses, carbohydrates, bran and oil cake, and inorganic for example, sodium chloride, calcined magnesite, calcium sulphate, chloride, phosphate, carbonate and other sulphates or phosphates.If desired the blocks can also include other ingredients to supplement particular items in an animal diet, or by way of medication. Examples of ingredients which it may be convenient to include are vitamins, trace elements selenium manganese etc and hormones.The acid catalyst is preferably phosphoric acid, because of the nutritional value of phosphorus but other acids such as sulphuric acid may be used instead.In the present process it will be appreciated that the acid base reaction is used to generate heat to cure the resin rapidly, and sufficient acid must be used to neutralize all the components of the mixture which are basic and leave a calculated excess of acid to catalyse resin cure. In this way it is possible to produce blocks rapidly and consistently with a relatively low cure time so that little production space is needed to store curing blocks.Preferably the two component streams are pumped to a mixing head where they are intimately mixed, and thence the mixture is either cast into moulds or extruded and subsequently cut up into blocks. The invention will now be described in more detail by reference to Examples.Examples 1 and 2In each case to components A and B were prepared, A being basic and B acidic. Where solids were present in component A in Example 1 and both components in Example 2 they were premixed with sufficient liquid to facilitate pumping. The two components were stored separately and came together only during pumping of the mixture into the block moulds when the two components were pumped to two separate inlets of a mixing head and mixed inside the head, wherefromreacting mixture was fed into the moulds, which were open topped cardboard boxes.In Example 2 part of the acid was pre neutralized with calcined magnesite, which was added to the acid with molasses to act as a heat sink.This increased the setting time of the blocks from 5 minutes in Example 1 to 15 minutes in Example 2.The formulations of the components used and analysis of the blocks produced are given below in Table I.
