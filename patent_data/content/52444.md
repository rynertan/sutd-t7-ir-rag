# A process of producing cobalt II chloride.

## Abstract
This invention is concerned with a process for dissolving oxidic trivaient cobalt compounds in hydrochloric acid to produce cobalt II chloride while avoiding the generation of chlorine. It includes the following steps a slurrying in water the trivalent cobalt compound to be dissolved and b treating the resulting slurry with a reduction agent preferably methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid and with hydro chloric acid. The contact of the hydrochloric acid with the slurry should occur in the presence of the reducing agent. The rate of acid addition should be controlled to maintain the slurry at a pH above 1.
