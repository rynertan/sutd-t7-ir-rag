# Shock absorber control unit for use in controlling a vehicle suspension.

## Abstract
A shock absorber control unit for controlling the damp ing force of a shock absorber 10 mounted in a vehicle. The control unit is designed to increase the damping force of the shock absorber 10 when the vehicle steering wheel 14 is rotated from a neutral position to a steered position, and to maintain the normal damping force of the shock absorber 10 when the steering wheel 14 is rotated from the steered position to the neutral position.
