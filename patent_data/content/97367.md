# Split structure type transformer.

## Abstract
A split structure type transformer has a core 1 , upper and lower split up secondary windings 2A, 2B and a primary winding 3 which are wound about the core, a single tap winding 6 16 26 36 having a plurality of tap winding parts 12Na to 15Na, 12Nb to 15Nb 22N to 25N 32N to 35N 42N to 45N and a plurality of tap terminals 11A to 15A, 11B to 15B 31 to 35 41 to 45 , and a single tap selector 5 . The secondary windings are respectively connectable to independent loads, only one end of the tap winding is connected to the primary winding, and the tap terminals are respectively connected to terminals T₁ to T₅ of the tap selector. A pair of tap winding parts connected to the same terminal of the tap selector are arranged adjacently along the axial direction of winding. Each of the tap winding part pairs may be replaced by a single tap winding part 32N to 35N 42N to 45N which is formed by winding a single strand having a crosssectional area which is twice a crosssectional area of a strand used for winding each tap winding part pair.
