# Digital tone control arrangement.

## Abstract
Digital tone control arrangement for a digital audio signal, comprising a recursive digital filter whose transfer function contains as many poles as there are zeros, the recursive filter also comprising a recursive portion and a non recursive portion each receiving filter coefficients which are stored in a memory means. So as to limit the total number of filter coefficients the memory means is divided into a first memory field for storing a first sub group of filter coefficients and into a number of second memory fields in each of which a second subgroup of filter coefficients is stored. By means of a switching device the first subgroup of the filter coefficients is applied either to the non recursive portion or to the recursive portion and a selected second subgroup of filter coefficients is applied to that portion recursive and the non recursive to which the first sub group of filter coefficients is not applied.
