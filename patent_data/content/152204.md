# COATING PROCESS

## Abstract
A substrate is coated with a coating material by rubbing substantially dry, discrete particles of the coating material across the surface of the substrate with a sufficient rate of energy input to cause them to adhere. Preferably, the particles are carried on the surface of a soft, resilient bufffing wheel rotating sufficiently rapidly to give peripheral speeds of from 2 to 200 m s. Exemplified coating materials include metals, metal oxides and plastics.
