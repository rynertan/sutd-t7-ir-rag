# A SHARED LINE RECEIVER

## Abstract
A shared line receiver module, operative to accept phase encoded bits serially from a shared line for pre determined buffering and subsequent transferral in par allel to an input output channel, includes a decoder operative to receive phase transitions of a signal from the shared line for conversion into a predetermined series of logic signals a first memory operative to receive the predetermined series of logic signals for the holding thereof for a predetermined period an ad dress recognizer operative to receive a first byte of the predetermined series of logic signals from the first memory indicating the destination address when avail able for holding thereof for a predetermined period, and an identification address register operative to receive an address from the input output channel for uniquely identifying the shared line receiver, and for comparing with identification address in said address recognized for the predetermined series of logic signals to the input output channel when an address match is obtained.
