# PACKAGING BAG AND METHOD FOR ITS FABRICATION

## Abstract
The invention relates to a cardboard made bag like package and a method for the fabrication thereof. The package is fabricated of two separate cardboard sheets 1, 2 of which the longer and narrower cardboard sheet 1 is double folded along a folding line 5 that forms the package bottom. The shorter and wider cardboard sheet 2 is adhered to one of the folded halves of longer cardboard sheet 1 in order to provide the package with a double wall. from whose top edge the end zone 4 of longer cardboard sheet 1 extends for forming a package closing flap. Side strips 3 of shorter cardboard sheet 2 are folded around the side edges of the other folded half of longer cardboard sheet 1 and adhered to its outer surface. The package can be fabricated at a high rate of production from cardboard webs delivered from supply rollers without cutting waste pieces.
