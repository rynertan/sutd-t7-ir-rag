# INTELLIGENT INTERFACING APPARATUS FOR THE AUTOMATIC MANAGEMENT OF A SWITCHED OR DEDICATED TELECOMMUNICATION LINE

## Abstract
An intelligent interfacing apparatus for the automatic management of a switched or dedicated telecommunica tion line which provides for the data transmission and the exchange of the informations between central and or peri pheral electronic processors, teletypewriters or video ter minals, or generally between logic or smart units even if different from each other, which are installed at different user connected via switched and or dedicated telecom munication lines. The interfacing device can be connected between the telecommunication line and the local station which is thus free from the establishing the telecommuni cation connection also by means of suitable conversion of protocols both towards the telecommunication net work and the called terminal, from exchanging the re quested data, monitoring and checking eventual failures occurred during the transmission, or inside the apparatus translating the format of the data and storing in the me mory the transmitted informations awaiting the recall by the logic unit at any moment. A reduced version of the intelligent interfacing apparatus can give it more trans parencies, leaving some tasks to the user s station mod em s commands .
