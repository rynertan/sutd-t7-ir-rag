# A thermoplastic resin composition having high heat resistance and articles molded therefrom.

## Abstract
A thermoplastic resin composition which has high heat resistance and high molding processability comprises 5 95 by wt. of a copolymer of a vinyl aromatic compound and an imide compound of an α,β unsaturated dicarboxylic acid and 5 95 by wt. of a polyphenylene ether. The addition of up to 90 by wt. of an impact resistance reinforcing agent gives molded articles high impact resistance without affecting the processability or heat resistance of the composition. Articles are molded from the composition by conventional methods.
