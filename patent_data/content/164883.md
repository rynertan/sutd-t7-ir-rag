# A METHOD FOR THE POLYMERIZATION OF A VINYLIC MONOMER

## Abstract
The invention provides an efficient means for preventing deposition of polymer scale on the reactor walls in the so called water polymerization of an ethylenically unsatu rated monomer in an aqueous medium carried out without addition of any emulsifying agent or suspending agent. The inventive method comprises, prior to the introduction of the polymerization mixture into the polymerization reactor, coating the reactor walls with a solution containing an organic dye compound, preferably, with a mixture of a silicic acid compound followed by drying.
