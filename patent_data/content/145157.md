# Thin film magnetic recording media.

## Abstract
A thin film magnetic recording disc is provided wherein a magnetic layer 8 is an alloy of cobalt and platinum disposed on a chromium layer 6 . A barrier layer 10 of chromium is formed on the cobalt platinum film and a wear layer 12 of an oxide of cobalt is provided on the barrier layer. The platinum content in the magnetic film is varied so as to provide a magnetic film with a desired coercivity which is significantly less dependent upon film thickness. This permits the cobalt platinum film thickness to be adjusted to meet a wide range of recording system design parameters. The coercivity of the magnetic film may be deterined primarily by the amount of platinum in the alloy and the saturation magnetization thickness product of the film is determined primarily by the film thickness.
