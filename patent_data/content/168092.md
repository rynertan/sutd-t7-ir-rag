# Rolling element bearing with seals.

## Abstract
It is well known that in case a bearing seal is subjected to severe circumstances e.g. splashing mud and water, to execute the sealing lip in such a way that it rests with high contact forces on its counterface. Higher friction will be generated and consequently higher temperature and wear. These disadvantages are obviated by the claimed seal arrangement which is characterized in that at the outside of the seal 14 a stiff shield 8 is applied which in sectional view is mainly L shaped. The shield 8 with its short leg 9 is fixed on the bearing inner ring 1 . The seal lip 16 rests on a supporting ring 10 of shield 8 . The improvement consists therein that between a bearing ring part 11 and end part of shield 8 a split 12 as well as between shield 8 and seal 14 a space 13 are both present. Due to this arrangement and under influence of centrifugal forces contaminated liquid are circulated in said space 13 to the outside of the bearing via said split 12 forming a sealing by itself as tests have shown.
