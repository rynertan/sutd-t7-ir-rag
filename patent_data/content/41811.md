## Description
1,Improvements relating to Servomotor Casings This invention relates to casings for fluid pressure servomotors and will be described with reference to vacuum suspended brake boosters for the wheel brakes of motor vehicles. Such boosters act to reduce the vehicle driver braking effort required to generate a given braking effect. Vacuum suspended brake boosters usually comprise two annular dished pressings flanged together at their outer rims to form a hollow casing. The booster is divided into two chambers by an annular diaphragm and contains valve means arranged to control a differential pressure across the diaphragm so as to provide a proportionate increase in output load from the booster for a given input load. The load transmitted by the booster is reacted through the casing to a part of the vehicle structure. The operation of such boosters is well known and will not be further described here. One problem with booster casings is that they must be sufficiently rigid to prevent undue flexing during transmission of reaction loads. A second, interelated,problem is that the booster casings must have an acceptable fatigue life. Whilst the attachment points of the booster to the vehicle structure can be placed at a sufficient radius to minimise the bending moment on the casing, the attachment points to the master cylinder are determined by the cylinder flange size and the bending moment is usually much greater. It is not desirable to increase the cylinder flange size since this would increase the weight of the assembly and lead to machining difficulties due to the larger overall diameter of the cylinder.Furthermore, such a change would be a departure from current industry standards and could reduce commonality between master cylinders for servo and non servo applications. It is known to stiffen the booster casing by ribbing the pressing but this can increase the size of the booster in critical installational areas at a time when auto manufacturers are seeking to reduce material weight and component size. It is difficult to achieve an acceptable fatigue strength in the base of a deep pressing,and ribbing compounds this difficulty since additional pressing operations are needed to produce the ribbed casing. The present invention provides an improved booster casing which is lighter than prior art casings and yet has sufficient rigidity to transmit booster reaction loads whilst retaining a good fatigue strength. The casing does not take up greater space than existing designs and is cheaper to manufacture. According to the present invention there is provided a fluid pressure diaphragm servomotor casing having a radial wall stiffened by being made of annular box section. Preferably the radial wall has an internal contour conforming substantially to the configuration of the diaphragm on the respective stroke which approaches closely the radial wall. Other features of the invention are included in the following description of a preferred embodiment shown, by way of example only, on the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a part sectional view through a vacuum suspended brake booster incorporating the invention. Fig. 2 is a transverse section through a stiffening plate according to the invention and Fig. 3 is a view of the plate of Fig. 2 in the direction of arrow A . With reference to Fig. 1 there is shown a conventional vacuum suspended brake booster 11 comprising two dished annular pressings 12,13 flanged together to form a hollow casing. The usual flexible diaphragm 14 dividing the casing into two chambers is supported by a diaphragm plate 15. Coil spring 16 urges the plate 15 and diaphragm 14 against the casing pressing 12. An input rod 17 from a driver s brake pedal not shown and an output rod 18 to a hydraulic master cylinder not shown are provided. Studs 19 and 21 are respectively for attachment to the vehicle bulkhead and to the master cylinder. Pipe fitting 22 is for connection to a vacuum source, usually the vehicle inlet manifold. In use the reaction loads from the master cylinder to the bulkhead are taken from studs 21 to studs 19 through the booster casing. The wall thickness of the casing must be sufficient to prevent flexing under load, particularly over the radial portion. Since the casing is subjected to repeated loadings it must also have an acceptable fatigue life. A stiffening plate 23 is provided in the casing to box the radial portion of the casing wall. The plate 23 may be attached by any convenient method, for example adhesives, spot welding or electron beam welding. Such a box section is inherently very rigid whilst enabling the material thickness to be reduced to approximately half the gauge previously required.Moreover, and with reference to Figs. 2 and 3, the plate 23 may be apertured to increase stiffness and to reduce weight. The box section construction enables the casing pressings to be of simple section so reducing cost of manufacture and resulting in a good fatigue life. The stiffening plate 23 may be internal or external of the booster. The invention is not limited to vacuum suspended boosters but is equally applicable to air suspended and compressed air suspended boosters of a similar construction. Whilst Fig. 1 depicts a direct acting booster it will be clear that the invention is applicable to remote boosters.
