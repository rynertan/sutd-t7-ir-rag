# Brake control mechanism.

## Abstract
A brake control mechanism 14 includes a housing 20 with a stepped bore 22 . A valve member 44 cooperates with a seat 46 to close communication from a master cylinder 10 to a brake assembly 12 when a vehicle is going up a hill. An actuator assembly 78 is operatively coupled to a clutch assembly 16 and is comprised of a plate 50 to control operation of the valve assembly in response to actuation of the clutch assembly 16 . The plate 50 includes a relatively small axial dimension and forms a central opening 54 for receiving the valve member 44 .
