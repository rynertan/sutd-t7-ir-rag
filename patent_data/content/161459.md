## Description
ALCOHOL AMINE ALKOXYLATES This invention relates to detergent compositions and method of making these compositions. More specifically, this invention relates to alcohol amine alkoxylates which function as excellent surfactant materials. The invention likewise provides a method of making such surfactants. It is known in the art that aqueous solutions of cleaning compositions desirably have strong cleaning action.In the theory of detergency, it is believed that in order for an aqueous cleaning system to be effective against oily soil or contaminants, that a hydrophillic and a hydrophobic portion of the surfactant molecule be present in order to ef fectively maintain the oily soil in the aqueous solution during cleaning. Among such well known cleaners are nonionic alcohol surfactants, usually alkoxylated, non ionic surfactants together with an adjunct in order to facilitate cleaning. Ethoxylation of amines is known using basic catalysts. However such materials produce highly colored products containing appreciable amounts of by products.These materials are generally considered amphoteric surfactants but are not generally favored because of expense and low effectiveness as compared to non ionic surfactants. The surface activity of both alcohol ethoxylates and amine ethoxylates are all well known, as set forth inNon Ionic Surfactants, M.J. Schick, Marcell Decker, Inc.New York, 1967 . Representative but non exhaustive examples of the patent art showing ethoxylated amines are U.S. Patents 3,741,912 3,953,382 3,696,057 and 4,276,205. However, all these references contain hydrophobic materials such as propylene oxides, or deal with amines containing a sufficiently large number of carbon atoms that the amine itself acts as a hydrophobic material. Thus all these references conform to accepted surfactant theory in that all these surfactants contain hydrophillic ethylene oxide groups and hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains. When a molecule contains either hydrophobic or hydrophillic groups alone, such molecules are not expected to function as surfactants. Ethoxylates of water soluble amines contain only hydrophillic groups and thus conform to this generally accepted theory. In light of this generally accepted theory, the present invention is distinctly unexpected, in that mixtures of alcohols and water soluble amines which are reacted with ethylene oxide in the presence of an alkali metal basic catalyst produce surfactant products whose surface tension is lower than each individual component alone. These materials contain hydrocarbon groups having no more than 7 carbon atoms and are substantially free of hydrophobic materials. Thus, in accordance with the present invention, I have now discovered a method for producing surfactants comprising ethoxylating a mixture of amine and alcohols with ethylene oxide in the presence of a basic catalyst, wherein a the alcohol is at least one alcohol selected from the group consisting of primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, tertiary alcohols or fluoroalcohols, and b the amine is at least one water soluble amine having a general formula selected from the group consisting ofEMI2.1 wherein X1, X2, and X3 are, independently, hydrogen, CH CH OH R1 are CH2CH CH3 OH, and wherein X4, X5, X6 and R and R are independently, straight branched cyclic or aromatic hydrocarbon groups containing no more than 7 carbon atoms, and where X4, X5 and X6 and RS can be hydrogen, and wherein n and m are less than or equal to 7, and q is less than or equal to 20. Thus the present invention can be carried out utilizing mixtures of the amines described together with all classes of alcohols including fluoro alcohols. However, alkanols are preferably used in the present invention. Use of such materials together with water soluble amines containing 7 or less carbon atoms provide a novel class of surfactants having exceptional surfactant properties. As an additional advantage, these materials will have excellent biodegrading unlike the propylene oxide containing surfactants of the prior art. Surfactants of the present invention can be prepared by reacting a mixture of alcohols and amines with ethylene oxide in the presence of an alkali metal basic catalyst. Preferred alkali metal catalysts are potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide. Mixtures of these catalysts can be used. In forming the surfactants of the present invention, the ethoxylation is carried out at temperatures ranging from about 900C to about 2600C. However, more normal temperatures are from about 1200C to about 2600C. Commercial operations are normally carried out at a temperature range of from about 1500C to about 2500C. The most preferred temperatures are from about 1500C to about 1900C. Normally, the alcohols reacted under the process of the present invention will contain from about 2 to about 36 carbon atoms. However, alcohols containing from about 4 to about 24 carbon atoms are preferred and those containing from about 10 to about 18 carbon atoms are most preferred. The process of the present inxtenslon can be carried out at ambient pressures. However, pressures up to about 100 pounds per square inch gauge can also be used.While pressure or lack of pressure is not a detriment to the process of the present invention, it is simply more convenient to carry out the reaction in a pressure range of from about atmospheric to about 100 psig. The ethoxylations of the present invention are carried out using ethylene oxide. Ethylene oxide useful in the present invention need not be specifically purified to rid it of small amounts of other impurities such as propylene oxide and the like, it being understood that excessive amounts of such contaminants could adversely affect the resultant surfactant. Reaction products can have any desired content of adducted ethylene oxide. For example, ethylene oxide will normally comprise from about 30 to about 80 content based on weight of the total surfactant. However, for most purposes, the content of ethylene oxide will range from about 40 to about 70 by weight. The weight of adducting material present in the reaction is not critical other than the amount necessary to provide sufficient ethylene oxide units to reach the mole adduct level desired for the particular alcohol amine mixture being reacted. In carrying out the process of the present invention, normally from about 0.05 to about 5.0 weight percent alkali metal basic catalyst will be used, based upon the combined weight of alcohol and amine to be reacted. The higher the concentration of catalyst, the more rapidly the reaction goes to completion. However, from a commercial and economical point of view, normally from about 0.1 to about 2 by weight is preferred. While the instant invention is effective with all classes of alcohols, alkanols are preferred. Of the alkanols, primary, secondary, linear and brancilea primary alkanols are the most commonly used and are the preferred alcohols of the present invention. Representative examples of such alcohols are those derived by hydrogenation of natural fats and oils, such as CO and TA alcohols, trademark of and sold by Proctor and Gamble Co., such as CO 124N alcohol, CO 1618 alcohol, and TA 1618 alcohol, and ADOL alcohols, trademark of and sold by Ashland Oil Co., such as ADOL 54 alcohol, ADOL 61 alcohol, ADOL 64 alcohol, ADOL 60 alcohol and ADOL 66 alcohol.Alcohols produced by Ziegler chemistry can also be ethoxylated.Examples of these alcohols are ALFOL alcohols, trademark of and sold by Conoco Inc., such as ALFOL 1012 alcohol, ALFOL 1214 alcohol, ALFOL 1412 alcohol, ALFOL 1618 alcohol, ALFOL 1620 alcohol and EPAL alcohols, trademark of and sold byEthyl Chemicah Co., such as EPAL 1012 alcohol, EPAL 1214 alcohol, EPAL 1418 alcohol.

Thus in a preferred form of the present invention, mixtures of alcohols and water soluble amines are reacted in the presence of an alkali metal catalyst with ethylene oxide to provide a highly unusual surfactant containing essentially no hydrophobic group in the amine portion. Amines useful in the present invention are those of the general formulaEMI8.1 as non exhaustively represented by triethanol amine, diethanolermine, ethanol amine, methyl amine, ethyl amine, pentyl amine1 dimethyl amine, methyl pentyl amine, and methyl hexyl amine EMI8.2 as non exhaustively represented by ethylene diamine, hexamethvlene diamine, and 1,2 diamino cyclohexane and orEMI8.3 as non exhaustively represented by bis hexamethylene triamine, and spermine, wherein X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, R1R, n, m and q are as previously described. Example 1 The following reactants and catalyst were added to a 600 milliliter stainless steel reactor 10.0g of a 12 to 14 carbon atom alcohol Alfol 1214, trademark of and sold by Conoco Inc 30.0 gm triethanol amine and 2.0 grams 45 aqueous KOH.After purging with N2 at 200 cc min., at 1500C, and for 20 minutes, 151g of ethylene oxide 60 was introduced in 42 minutes reaction temperature, 150 50C, ethylene oxide pressure, 60 psig . The product was then cooled to 800C and was neutralized with acetic acid. The product gave surface tension lowering at 250C as indicated in Figure 1. Example 2 An experiment was repeated as in Example 1 with 100 grams of 12 to 1 carbon atom alcohol and 2g of aqueousKOH. The product, which contained 604 ethylene oxide, gave surface tension reduction as depicted in Figure 1.Figure 1 clearly shows that the ethoxylate of alcohol amine mixture is more surface active than the ethoxylate of alcohol alone. Example 3 The following reactants and catalyst were added to a 600 ml stainless steel reactor 70.0 grams of alcohol as described in Example 1, 30.0 grams of methylpentamethylenediamine and 2.0 grams of 45 aqueous KOH. Ethylene oxide 151g, 60 was introduced as described in Example 1.Figure 2 compares surface tension reduction obtained with this product with the reduction obtained with the alcohol ethoxylate prepared in Example 2. Again, the ethoxylate of the alcohol amine mixture shows higher surface activity than the ethoxylate of alcohol alone. While certain embodiments and details have been shown for the purpose of illustrating this invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various changes and modifications may be made herein without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
