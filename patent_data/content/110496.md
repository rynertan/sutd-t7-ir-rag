## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN KETO INTERMEDIATES, THEIR USE AND PREPARATION This invention relates to novel keto intermediates, their preparation and their use in preparing other compounds. A group of octahydropyrazolof3,4 g quinolines is disclosed in United States Patent 4,198,415 issuedApril 15, 1980, and in a divisional application thereof,United States Patent 4,230,861 issued October 28, 1980.Both intermediates and final products are disclosed therein and one reaction sequence so described is as follows EMI1.1 wherein R is H, C1 C3 alkyl, allvl or benzyl, R1 isH or COOZ and Z is Cl C2 alkyl, benzyl, a methylbenzyl, or phenylethyl. The compounds of formulaIIIa or IIIb where R1 is H and R is C1 C3 alkyl or allyl are useful as inhibitors of prolactin secretion and in the treatment of Parkinson s syndrome. The compounds of formula IIIa or IIIb where R and H are H, where R is benzyl or where R1 is COOZ are intermediates. The intermediates are converted by methods disclosed in the above patents to drugs.The reagent used to transform the l substituted 3 permissibly substituted 5 oxodecahydroquinoline I to the intlmediate II is a dimethylformamide acetal such as drmethylformamide dimethylacetal. Surprisingly, in accordance with this invention, it has been discovered that a novel keto intermediate provides a better process route to prepare the compounds of formulae lila and IIIb above. The advantages of using this novel intermediate are that cheaper reagents are used, that higher yields of the final product result, and that no isolation of the keto intermediate is required, although it may be isolated if desired. Thus, in accordance with this invention, an improved method of preparing trans dl 5 substituted 7 permissibly substituted 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9 octahydro lH and 2H pyrazolo 3,4 g quinolines of formulae IIIa andIIIb is set forth in Reaction Scheme I below Reaction Scheme IEMI3.1 wherein R is C1 C3alkyl, allyl or benzyl, R1 is H or COOZ and Z is C1 C2 alkyl, benzyl, a methylbenzyl, or phenylethyl. According to Reaction Scheme I, a trans dl l substituted 3 permissibly substituted 6 oxodeca hydroquinoline I is formvlated with a C1 C6 alkyl formate in the presence of base to yield a trans dl 1 substituted 3 permissibly substituled 6 oxo 7 formyldecahydroquinoline, represented as a series of tautomeric structures IVa d .This intermediate is ordinarily not isolated and characterized as such but is reacted immediately in situ with hydrazine to yield as a mixture of tautomers trans dl substituted 7 permissibly substituted 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9 octahydro lH pyrazolo 3,4 g quinolirle gila and trans dl 5 substituted 7 permissibly substituted 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9 octahydro 2H pyrazolo 3,4 g quinoline IlIb . The formylated product described above as four tautomeric structures IVa d , probably exists predominantly in aqueous solution as the zwitterion IVb . However, all four tautomeric forms are in dynamic equilibrium, and in this specification, if any single structure is pictured or described, the other three are implied and contained herein. Also, resonance structures of various formulae above are also included, such asEMI4.1 The first step of the above reaction is a modification of a Claissen condensation wherein a methylene group activated by an adjacent carbonyl group can be acylated in the presence of base. The base commonly employed is sodium ethylate. However, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, other bases such as the alkali metal t alkoxides and hydrides, specifically, potassium t butoxide, potassium t amylalkoxide, or sodium hydride, can also be used.TheClaissen condensation reaction I IV is also usually carried out in ethanolic solution. As will also be apparent to those skilled in the art, other lower alkanols and similar polar anhydrous solvents can be employed as reaction media. Examples of suitable solvents are tetrahydrofuran THF , diethyl ether, dimethoxyethane, dioxane, dimethylsulfoxide DMSO , dimethylformamide DMF and t butanol. Tetrahydrofuran is preferred as the solvent for the entire process inReaction Scheme I. Although temperature of the reaction is not critical, a range from about 200C. to reflux may be used, with OOC. to room temperature being preferred. In the ring closure step tIV IIIa IIIb , hydrazine is specified but hydrazine hydrate or salts of hydrazine can be used with equal success. Suitable solvents for the ring closure step are water, C1 C4 alkanols, especially t butanol, THF, DMSO, dimethoxyethane, dioxane, and diethyl ether. The reaction can be run at a temperature from about 0 C. to reflux, with room temperature being preferred. It is an advantage of the synthetic route described in Reaction Scheme I that hoth steps of the procedure can be carried out in the same reactor i.e., it can be a one pot process. Thus, solvents suitable for both reactions are preferred such as THF, DSO, t butanol, dimethoxyethane, diethyl ether, and dioxane, especially THF. If desired water or a C1 C4 alkanol can be added to the solvent system. A range of pH from about 13 to about 0 can be used, with a pH of about 9 being preferred. The preferred pH of about 9 is obtained by adding 10 HC1 solution 1 mole to the reaction mixture. Although a temperature range from about 0 C. to reflux can be used, room tempera..ure is preferred. A second advantage is that the yields of the pyrazole tautomers IIIa IIIb are superior to those encountered with the process of the prior art which uses dimethylformamide dimethylacetal as a reagent. A further advantage is that the preferred formylating chemical employed, ethyl formate, is relatively inexpensive compared to dimethylformamide dimethylacetal. It should be pointed out that the numbering of the ketone starting material I is different from that of the pyrazole final product III . Thus, the asymmetric bridgehead carbon adjacent to the quinoline nitrogen is numbered 8a in the ketone while it is numbered 4a in the pyrazole. Furthermore, the other asymmetric bridgehead carbon is numbered 4a in the ketone while it is numbered 8a in the final product. The racemic pairs of formulae IIIa and IIIb are ordinarily referred to as a cis dl pair and a trans dl pair.The configuration of the molecule at C 4a and C 8a in the cis dl pair would be a 4aR,8aS, and 4aS,8aR and for the trans dl pair, 4aR,8aR, and 4aS,BaS. The starting chemical configurations are of course maintained in the synthesis of the pyrazoloquinoline since the Claissen condensation and subsequent ring closure with hydrazine do not affect configuration at these optical centers.Our cofiled Application No.EMI7.1 Agents ref. X 6103 describes a method of separating trans dl l n propyl 6 oxodecahydroquinoline I where R is n propyl and R1 is H into its component stereoisomers la 4aR,R and Tb 4a5,8aS . EMI7.2 The procedure of the present invention is as applicable to the separated isomers Ia and Ib as it was to the trans dl racemate, shown in Reaction Scheme I. The sequence of reactions from Reaction SchemeI is repeated in Reaction Sequence II below using the desired isomer, 4aR,8aR l n propyl 6 oxodecahydroquinoline, to prepare the desired 4aR,8a 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9 octahydro lH and 2H pyrazolo 3,4 g3quinoline. Reaction Sequence IIEMI8.1 An advantage of the process set forth inReaction Scheme II lies in the fact that the trans dl ketone I is resolved and the pure 4aR,8aR stereoisomer Ia cyclized to yield an optically active trans 4aR,8aR octahydropyrazolof3,4 g quinoline, rather than cyclizing the trans dl racemate and resolving the trans dl pyrazoloquinoline. Since one half at least of a racemic mixture is discarded during a resolutionr it is clearly more economical to discard half of a starting material than half of a final product, particularly since organic reactions such as the cyclization of the ketoquinoline to a pyrazoloquinoline are never quantitative. In the following specific examples, which illustrate the present invention, the listed abbreviations are used. THF tetrahydrofuran tlc thin layer chromatography Example 1 One and one half g. of potassium t butoxide was weighed into a dry 250 ml. round bottom flask.Twenty five ml. of THF were added to dissolve the potassium t butoxide. Next, a solution containing 0.81 ml. of ethyl formate, 0.97 g. 0 trans dl l n propyl 6 oxo 1ecahydroqllinoline and 10 ml. of THF were added to the butoxide solution. The reaction mixture was maintained at ambient temperature for about 45 minutes.Two ml. of hydrazine were then added followed by sufficient 15 aqueous hydrochloric acid to lower the pH to about 9. The consequent reaction mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at ambient temperature at which time tIc indicated that no ketone starting material was present.The reaction mixture was then poured into dilute 10 aqueous sodium hydroxide and the alkaline mixture extracted with methylene dichloride equal volume . The extract was dried and the solvent removed by evaporation in vacuo to yield 1.31 g. of a yellow oil comprising crude trans dl 5 n propyl 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9 octahydro lH and 2H pyrazolo 3,4 g quinoline. Example 2 A sufficient amount of 55 suspension of sodium hydride in mineral oil to yield 360 mg. 15 mmoles of sodium hydride was placed in a 25 ml. round bottom flask. The mineral oil was removed from the sodium hydride hy washing three times with hexane. The residual sodium hydride was then suspended in 6 ml. of THF. Ethyl formate 740 mg. plus one drop of anhydrous ethanol were next added followed by 975 mg. of trans dl 1 n propyl6 oxodecahydroquinoline in 4 ml. of THF. The reaction mixture, which began to reflux almost immediately, was maintained at reflux temperature for about 45 minutes after which time tlc showed no remaining starting material. 50 ml. of water and 4 ml. of hydrazine were added and the pH adjusted with dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid to about pH 9. This reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature over night, forming a precipitate.The precipitate consisting of 373 mg. of a white powder, trans dl 5 n propyl 4,4a,5,6,7,B,Ba,9 octahydro lH and 2H pyrazolo 3, 4 g quinoline,melting at 78 840 C.was collected. Analysis Calculated for C13H2lN3 C, 71.19 H, 9.65 N, 19.16 Found C, 70.89 H, 9.15 N, 19.34. Additional material was obtained by pouring the filtrate into dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and extracting this alkaline solution with several portions of methylene dichloride. Concentration of the combined methylene dichloride extracts after drying yielded an additional 623 mg. of a white foam which was purified by chromatography over silica using THF containing a trace of aqueous ammonium hydroxide as the eluant. Early fractions shown to contain the desired pyrazolo 3,4 g quinoline were combined to yield, after evaporation of the solvent, 437 mg. of a colorless oil. This oil was converted to the dihydrochloride salt which melted at about 252 2630C. after recrystallization from a methanol acetone solvent mixture. The above run was repeated except that 125 mg.of trans 4aR, BaR n propyl 6 oxodecahydroquinoline were used and the amounts c L ethyl formate and base sodium hydride in place of potassium t butoxide decreased proportionately. After the reaction was substantially complete, as shown by lack of starting material on tlc analysis, the reaction mixture was poured into dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide and the alkaline mixture extracted with methylene dichloride. Drying of the methylene dichloride extract followed by removal of the solvent in vacuo yielded about 144 mg. of a colorless viscous oil which yielded only a single spot on tlc. The oil was dissolved in methanol and 0.20 N aqueous hydrochloric acid added 3.2 ml. . Concentration of the resulting yellow solution yielded a yellow semi solid material which was dissolved in methanol. The methanol solution was decolorized with carbon and the carbon removed by filtration through celite. Evaporation of the solvent and recrystallization of the resulting residue from a methanol ethyl acetate solvent mixture gave 80 mg.of a butter yellow powder 4aR,8aR 5 n propyl 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9 octahydro lH and 2H pyrazolo 25 3,4 glquinoline a D 121.76 . H2O, c l . Example 3 A solution of 52 g. of optically pure 4aR,BaR l n propyl 6 oxodecahydroouinoline and 79 g. of ethyl formate in 250 ml. of TF was added to a solution of 59.8 g. of potassium t butoxide in 600 ml. of THF previously cooled to about OOC. Gas evolved during the addition. The reaction mixture was stirred at about 0 C. for one half hour and at ambient temperature for an additional hour. Twenty five and six tenths grams of hydrazine were added and the pH of the solution adjusted to pHx9 with 10 aqueous hydrochloric acid about 500 ml. . This reaction mixture was stirred vigorously at ambient temperature for two hours, after which time it was poured into water. The aqueous mixture was made strongly basic pyx13 with dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide. The alkaline mixture was extracted with methylene dichloride, and the methylene dichloride extract separated and dried. Evaporation of the solvent left a yellow foam as a residue which by tlc contained the desired pyrazoloquinoline plus a minor amount of a single impurity.The residue was dissolved in 1 liter of hot methanol to which was added 250 ml. of lN aqueous hydrochloric acid. Concentration of the solution yielded 65.4 g. of 4aR,8aR 5 n propyl 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9 octahydro lH and 2H pyrazolo 3,4 g quinoline hydrochloride as a light yellow solid. Recrystallization from methanol ethyl acetate gave 51.7 g. 768 yield of a 25 slightly yellow granular solid alpha 121.0 25 H2O,c 1 alpha 365 377.40 H2O, c 1 .

THF at 0 C. was added a solution containing 5.0 C3 of trans dl 1 n propyl 6 oxodecahydroquinoline and 2.36 g. of ethyl formate in 25 ml. of THF. The solution was stirred at 0 C. for 15 minutes and then at room temperature for 17 hours.
