# Process for preparing aromatic urethanes.

## Abstract
In a process for preparing an aromatic urethane which comprises reacting an aromatic nitro compound, an organic compound containing at least one hydroxyl group, and carbon monoxide at elevated temperature and pressure in the presence of a catalytic system composed of a catalyst consisting of a platinum metal, a platinum metal compound, and or a platinum metal compound containing compound and a promoter consisting of a Lewis acid and or a Lewis acid containing compound, an organic primary amino compound, a urea compound, a biuret compound, an allophanate compound, or a mixture thereof is added to the reaction system whereby the reaction rate is increased and the yield of the desired product is enhanced. For example, 2,4 diethylcarbamate toluene can be prepared at quantitative yield by reacting 2,4 dinitrotoluene, ethanol, carbon monoxide, and a small amount of aminonitrotoluene at elevated temperature and pressure in the presence of palladium chloride and ferrous chloride pyridine complex.
