# Method of preparing a calibrated drop out disk.

## Abstract
A standardized, calibrated drop out disk is provided to test disk certification equipment. The disk is a previously certified high quality disk having one or more selected tracks thereon upon which data is recorded at a standard level over some portions of the track and at differing levels on other portions of the track known as drop out portions. The magnitude and playback amplitude of the drop out portions is selected to be less than that of the remaining portions of the track. Methods of creating the standardized drop out disk utilizing either varying write currents delivered to the head for the different portions of the track, and or write heads of different width being utilized are also provided. The standar dized drop out disks are utilized to test the sensitivity and accuracy of disk certification equipment as it is used to test production of magnetic disks.
