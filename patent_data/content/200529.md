# Self tightening shaft coupler.

## Abstract
A self tightening shaft coupler 18 includes a rigid, elongate coupling sleeve 20 having an externally com pressible collet 21,22 threaded into each end. The collets engage the ends of the shafts 15,17 which are to be joined such that the shafts are coupled to one another through the coupling sleeve. The threading of the collets and the coupling sleeve is such that rotation of the shafts in a predetermined direction tends to tighten the collets onto the shafts whereby self tightening action is achieved.
