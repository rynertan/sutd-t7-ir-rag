# HEADBAND ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
The device described herein comprises a sweatband adapted to collect sweat from the forehead of a runner or other exerciser into a trough and to direct the collected sweat to run out of the collecting trough through draining means positioned so as to let the collected sweat run out at the side of the wear er s head, preferably near his ears. The sweatband preferably has a lip extending upward and inward from the outer side of the trough, or that side not adjacent to the wearer s forehead, whereby any sloshing or overflow to the collected sweat that might be caused by the motion or jarring of the wearer s body will be avoided. In another preferred modification the side of the sweatband which is adapted to be positioned against the wearer s forehead is advantageously made of a wide strip of material to give more firm positioning against the forehead. Since this will cover a substantial area of the forehead, it is preferable to have substantial openings cut into this strip or have the strip molded with these open areas so that sweat from behind the open areas of the band will be allowed to run down into the collecting groove. In still another preferred modifica tion the forehead may be used to form one side of a trough by having a lower portion of the band pressed tightly against the forehead and an upper portion of the band tilted away from the forehead.
