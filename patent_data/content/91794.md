# Process for preparing 1.6 disubstituted 2 aminobenzimidazoles.

## Abstract
This invention concerns a process for preparing 2 amino 1,5 6 substituted benzimidazole compounds by reacting a 1 unsubstituted 2 amino 5 6 substituted benzimidazole compound with a sulfonyl chloride or a haloalkyl isothiocyanate in the presence of an acid acceptor base, water, and a water miscible nonhydroxylic solvent.
