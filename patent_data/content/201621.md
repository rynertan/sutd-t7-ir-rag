## Description
The invention relates to an apparatus for detection and analysis of anomalies within coal seam formations as well as to a method for detecting such geological anomalies in underground coal seam formations. Coal seams or deposits occurring in layered formations have been distorted by many different types of geological mechanisms. Differential compaction occurring in surrounding layers causes faults, twists and rolls to occur in the seam. Ancient streams have washed coal from beds leaving sand and rock deposits. These deposits, known as alluvial channel sand scours, can cause wahsouts and weak roof. Such seam distortions and rock deposits are physical barriers to mining equipment. Two types of underground mining techniques are extensively used in the coal mining industry. One type, referred to as room and pillar, or continuous mining can mine around many of these barriers. The continuous mining technique is less expensive and requires less manpower. For example, set up generally requires three shifts of eight people. Continuous mining, however, produces only approximately 300 tons per shift. Longwall mining, the other widely used technique, is much mor efficient in uniform coal beds. This method yields production rates averaging 1500 ton per shift. In the United States, the Mining Safety and Health Administration requires that retreating, rather than advancing longwalls be used. On the other hand, in Europe, advancing longwalls are extensively used. Retreating longwalls are set up to mine in the direction of the main entry, whereas advancing longwalls mine away from the main entry. Continuous mining techniques are employed to set up the retreating longwall. From the main entry, two entry ways are mined at right angles to the main entry and on either side of the longwall panel. These entry ways, the head gate entry and tail gate entry respectively, extend the length of the longwall panel. At the end of the panel, a crosscut is made between the head gate and tail gate entries. The wall of the crosscut facing the main entry is the longwall face. The longwall machine is set up along the face with a heading towards the main entry. As the longwall moves forward, the roof caves in over the mined out area. A barrier block of unmined coal is left at the end of the run to support the roof over the main entry. The high yield of longwall mining makes it economically advantageous to use where a long panel can be mined. A typical longwall panel contains from 500,000 to one million tons of coal. The initial investment and set up cost of longwall mining are high. Equipment cost averages many millions of dollars. Longwall set up requires thirty days minimum, at three shifts per day with twelve to fourteen men per shift. Thus, set up expenses are very large as a result and to achieve the low cost production advantage of the longwall method a uniform coal seam is necessary to ensure a long production run. Seam anomalies such as faults, washouts, interbeddings and dikes can cause premature termination of the longwall production run. In many instances, longwalls become ironbound after encountering an anomaly. Removal of such ironbound equipment requires blasting which can damage equipment and exposes miners to extreme danger. Accordingly, if seam anomalies could be detected and analyzed in advance of mining, the mining techniques could be planned for minimum production cost. Where the survey discloses a long continuous coal seam, the low cost longwall technique can be employed. If barriers to longwall mining are discovered the mine engineering department can use continuous mining to mine around the barriers, or the anomalies can be removed, for example by fracking or blasting. Geological surveys for potentially productive coal formations use many well known procedures. These procedures employ a wide variety of technologies. Satellite imaging and photography provide global data for use by mine geologists. However, because of the broad overview of the data they are of no value in determining the mineability of a coal seam. Macrosurvey foot prospecting of surface strata and outcrop features enable geologists to forecast formation characteristics based upon prior knowledge. Surface based seismic and electromagnetic wave propagation procedures are extensively used in geophysical surveys for valuable deposits including oil and gas. These microsurvey techniques, however, are not reliable in examining the detailed structure of a coal seam. Various microsurveying in seam seismic techniques are currently employed to yield useful data concerning seam anomalies. A technique under development in Europe comprises firing shots from sixteen points into a block of 120 geophone groups, each consisting of thirty six geophones. Computerized processing of the seismic data results in the detection of faults. To date, the procedure requires placing charges at 1.5 m 5 ft intervals and requires the installation of extensive cabling. Seismic techniques are primarily intended for advancing, rather than retreating longwalls. Further, this method has not proven to have the capability of resolving channel sand anomalies, especially for partial washouts and smaller, less significant anomalies, nor can they detect roof floor rock conditions. The emerging of the surface based spectral magnetotelluric method with controlled sources may have the capability of seeing into the earth s crust. This method apears to be useful in detecting major faults in layered formations, but cannot resolve detailed seam structure. Downhole drilling has been used to probe longwall blocks. A ten twelve hole pattern drilled 180 m 600 ft into the panel provides samples of the coal in the seam. This method, however, has the disadvantage of covering only a small percentage of the block. Because of this limited coverage this technique is not useful to detect and resolve seam anomalies that may exist in the seam between the boreholes. Surface core drilling and logging remains the most reliable source of seam information. Core sampling provides useful data in mapping stratified mediums. Logging enables probing of the formation in the vicinity of the drill hole. None of the currently used logging methods can detect and resolve seam anomalies that may exist in the seam between the bore holes over distances greater than about fifty feet. In seam horizontal drilling can detect seam anomalies, but is subject to the same coverage limitations of vertical drilling. Horizontal drilling, additionally, is very expensive, averaging twenty cents per ton of coal produced. Electromagnetic technologies have been investigated in an attempt to provide a geophysical method to see within the coal seams. Conventional and synthetic radar techniques have been reported in the literature. Because of the high frequency of the radar, it is exceedingly useful in investigating the geological structure in near proximity to the borehole. Deep seam penetration, however, requires very high transmit power in order to maintain any sort of useful resolution. This is because high frequency signals are attenuated very rapidly with distance in the seam. Accordingly, present radar methods cannot see deep into the seam. Publications by R.J. Lytle, A study conducted by Arthur D. Little, Inc. for the U.S. Bureau of Mines investigated continuous wave medium frequency signal propagation in coal. The results, published by Alfred G. Emslie and Robert L. Lagace in Radio Science , Vol. 11, No. 4, pages 253 261 , April 1976, dealt with the use of electromagnetic waves for communication purposes only. Additionally, errors may be present in the wave propagation equations employed. In a further publication on pages 275 283 in Radio Science of the same volume, borhole measurements of conductivity and dielectric constant in the 300 kHz to 25 MHz frequency range are reported by R. N. Grubb, P. L. Orswell and J. H. Taylor. The configuration of the magnetic dipole axis is chosen parallel to the borehole rather than orthogonal to it, because this gives a field configuration in which the magnetic field is parallel to the borehole and minimizes the effect of the borhole and cables between the dipoles on the measurement. Only the neighborhood of the borehole can be measured and no imaging technique is possible. GB A 1,018,188, issued to Kaiser, discloses a method for testing various media utilizing high frequency radio waves. A well logging method and apparatus is disclosed in EP A 0,105,801, assigned to Schlumberger Limited. The method is not directed to deep seam penetration and imaging, but is used to obtain conductivity and dielectric measurements proximate to a borhole. GB A 2,091,513 describes an apparatus for detection and analysis of anomalies within coal seam formation according to the preamble of claim 1. As electromagnetic radiation radar is used for earth probing and especially coal in situ. Radar impulses produce return signals per transmitted pulse, and selected successive return signals are processed to produce visually any structural inhomogenities within the earth structure. This radar method needs large energies. Other electromagnetic techniques suffer similar range and resolution problems. Nono of the prior art recognized the existance of a coal seam transmission window in the 300 to 800 kHz range. Accordingly, none of the prior art achieved a long range, high resolution imaging of geological anomalies. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide instrumentation and procedures for in seam and surface imaging of coal seam anomalies with a range sufficient to image an entire longwall panel. It is a further object of the present invention to provide instrumentation and procedures to image coal seam anomalies with resolution sufficient to detect faults, full and partial washouts, alluvial channel sand scours, dikes and interbeddings. It is a further object of the present invention to minimize production costs by surface mapping of fault directions, and providing longwall headings where appropriate. It is another object of the present invention to minimize production costs by in seam imaging of longwall panels, after the panel headings have been developed. An additional object of the present invention is to mitigate or eliminate hazards to miners resulting from unexpected geological anomalies. It is another object of the present invention to measure coal seam heights. It is a further object of the present invention to provide detailed in seam imaging of the seam in advance of the longwall. It is a further object of the present invention to predict roof falls. It is a further object of the present invention to verify predicted anomalies by signal strength measuring means. The invention is set out in apparatus claim 1 and in method claim 12 , with appending claims containing further embodiments. Briefly, a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a continuous wave medium frequency transmitter with FM capabilities and equipped with a directional loop antenna, a continuous wave medium frequency receiver equipped with a directional loop antenna and capable of accurately measuring and recording the received signal amplitude and phase shift of the transmitted signal, and data processing means for producing a pictorial representation of the coal seam from the raw data generated. Both the transmitter and the receiver are portable and are designed in two configurations a cylindrical configuration, referred to as a sonde, for insertion down boreholes in a coal seam, and a portable, or entry configuration adaptable for in seam use. The invention further includes survey procedures for imaging structures in coal seams. Two methods of seam imaging are provided with procedure selection dependent on terrain and seam depth. surface based seam imaging with downhole continuity instruments is expected to be used in moderately shallow beds with good surface drilling conditions. In seam imaging with tomographic techniques will be used when a clear picture of the seam structure is required. Combination techniques, utilizing both downhole and in seam measurements may be used for improved resolution as circumstances dictate. The preferred embodiment utilizes continuous wave medium frequency MF signals to achieve high resolution imaging of geophysical anomalies in coal seams with relatively low output power. The medium frequency range is generally defined as being between approximately 300 kHz and approximately 3 MHz. Because the coal seam is bounded above and below by rock with a differing conductivity, at certain signal frequencies electromagnetic energy becomes trapped and will propagate over great distances. This transmission window, or coal seam mode is excited by the tuned loop antennas employed in the preferred embodiment causing the MF signals to travel several hundred meters in the coal seam. Seam anomalies create regions with different electrical constitutive parameters relative to the coal. This electrical contrast between the coal and the anomalous structure gives rise to the imaging method. The contrast will change the wave propagation constant in the region whereby the wave received on the far side of the region can be analyzed to determine structure between the transmitter and receiver. The MF in seam continuity and tomography instruments further employ FM signals with a narrow occupied spectrum bandwidth. The receiving instruments detect and measure the signals with phase locked loop PLL techniques. PLL receivers extend the signal detection threshold well into the noise, thus enhancing operating range. The continuity imaging procedure is used where relatively large electrical contrast between the coal seam and anomalous structure is present. Tomography is applicable when a small electrical contrast exists. Tomography instrumentation can improve resolution by making more spatial measurements, thus overcoming the inherent radar range limitations. The downhole procedure will require a drilling plan that will enable the medium frequency signals to propagate in the seam between boreholes. In this procedure, a plurality of holes are drilled on either side of the seam. The transmitter and receiver probes are inserted into the boreholes on opposite sides of the seam and signal attenuation is measured across the seam. A series of data points is generated by varying the location of the transmitter and receiver across the series of boreholes. Signal attenuation, path attenuation, and phase shift are measured and compared with calculated values to determine if seam anomalies are present. Additionally these data can be reconstructed by computer assisted imaging techniques to provide a pictorial representation of the seam. When a fault is detected additional boreholes are drilled bisecting boreholes in the original drilling plan and further readings are taken to localize the fault. The in seam imaging technique is carried out in a similar manner to the surface based imaging technique except the transmitter and receiver instruments are located in the head and tail gate entries adjacent to the seam. Additionally, the instrumentation can be used to improve mining safety by detecting coal seam fire headings. Fire in the seam affects the coal seam s conductivity and will thus be detected in the same manner as anomalies are detected. Where a fire is known to exist the in seam detection methods are used to localize it so it can be controlled. In another application, communications with trapped miners can be established by equipping the miners with small receivers or transceivers. By drilling in the suspected area of the trapped miner, the downhole instrument can excite the coal seam mode and be used to communicate with the trapped miner. It is an advantage of the present invention that graphical representation of coal seam anomalies are developed by the imaging technique. It is another advantage of the present invention that production costs can be minimized by selecting the appropriate mode of mining the coal. It is a further advantage of the present invention that the imaging can be carried out using a minimum of equipment and a minimum of boreholes. It is a further advantage of the present invention that imaging can be accomplished using a relatively low transmitter power. It is a further advantage of the present invention that mining safety can be improved through the detection of geological anomalies in the working phase. It is yet another advantage that partial washouts caused by alluvial channel sand scour can be detected by the present invention. It is a further advantage that roof floor rock conditions can be determined by the present invention. It is yet another advantage of the present invention that the instrumentation can be used to communicate with trapped miners, thus increasing mining safety. It is a further advantage that coal seam fire headings can be determined with the present invention. It is a further advantage of the present invention that coal seam heights may be measured. It is a further advantage of the present invention that detailed seam images can be obtained in advance of the longwall. It is yet another advantage of the present invention that roof falls can be predicted. It is a further advantage of the present invention that in seam verification of anomalies can be performed. These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after having read the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments as illustrated in the various drawing figures. Fig. 1 illustrates a portable continuous wave medium frequency CW MF receiver for in seam tomographic imaging. As used herein, tomography is a generic term to denote an electromagnetic process of imaging structure in a coal seam using medium frequency MF signals. The imaging process may or may not use the tomography algorithm. The receiver is designated by the general reference character 10 and is of the single conversion, superheterodyne type with a frequency range of 300 to 800 kHz, tunable in five kHz increments. Receiver 10 is designed to automaticaly measure field strength of a transmitted signal, and to convert this measured field strength into a digital signal for subsequent data processing. Receiver 10 includes a tuned loop antenna 11, a distance logging keyboard 12, a magnetic tape recorder 13 and a field strength display 14. Fig. 2 illustrates a continuous wave medium frequency transmitter referred to by the general reference character 20. The transmitter 20 is a class B transmitter with a frequency range of 300 to 800 kHz, tunable in five kHz increments. The output power of transmitter 20 is twenty watts. This is sufficient to provide a range of at least 470 m 1550 feet at 520 kHz, depending on the medium. Transmitter 20 is equipped with a tuned loop antenna 21. The transmitter antenna 21 and the receiver antenna 11 may be constructed, for example, by sandwiching a predetermined number of turns of wire between a pair of flexible elastic strips of plastic material, and securing the strips in a circle. The plastic strips can temporarily deform to allow passage through tight quarters, and may be formed of a flexible plastic sold under the trademark Lexan . The transmitter 20 and receiver 10 are constructed in a configuration adaptable for in seam use as later described herein and illustrated in Fig. 4. In addition to the continuous wave signal capability of receiver 10 and transmitter 20, the transmitter 20 is further designed to generate and transmit narrowband frequency modulation FM signals, and the receiver 10 is further designed to receive narrowband FM signals and to demodulate those signals. This capability allows for phase shift measurements which yields additional useful data in detecting and imaging the geological anomalies. For such measurements, a reference signal must be sent from the transmitter 20 to the receiver 10. This signal is sent through fiber optics cable 22 as shown in Fig. 5. Fiber optics cable 22 is coupled to receiver 10 through reference cable connector 24, and is coupled to transmitter 20 through connector 26. In seam imaging requires access immediately adjacent to the coal seam. In situations where the head and tail gate entries have not been cut, as in the case of advancing longwall mining, or where the bed is moderately shallow with good surface drilling characteristics, surface based imaging employing downhole probes can be used. Fig. 3 illustrates the general configuration of a downhole probe, or sonde and referred to by the general reference character 30. The probe 30 is of a cylindrical configuration for insertion down a standard size borehole. Probe 30 includes an outer hollow structural cylinder 37 of a diameter of about two and one quarter inches. Cylinder 37 may be constructed of a variety of materials, and in the preferred embodiment is of a radiolucent material such as fiberglass. Rotatably mounted within cylinder 37 is a support frame 40. Support frame 40 is a solid cylinder with a longitudinal trough 42 ending at a pair of opposing flat faces 43. Mounted on each of the flat faces 43 is a modular circuit board including antenna heading control 44, modem 45 and either a receiver 46 or a transmitter 47 depending on whether receive or transmit capability is desired of the probe. Located in longitudinal trough 42 are conductors of a tuned loop antenna 48. Because of the directional nature of the radio transmissions through tuned loop antenna 48, means must be provided to mechanically orient the respective antennas of the receiver and transmitter probes to a co planar alignment. This is accomplished by rotating the frame 40 within the outer cylinder 37 by means of a drive motor 49. Drive motor 49 is fixed to the proximal end of cylinder 37 and mechanically coupled to frame 40 whereby frame 40 can be rotated through a full 360 within cylinder 37. In the preferred embodiment, power to drive motor 49 is supplied by six nickel cadmium batteries 50 fixed to the proximal end of support frame 40, just below drive motor 49. cylinder 37 is sealed at its distal end by an end cap 51 and at its proximal end by an end cap 52. End cap 52 contains a standard four pin socket 53 into which is plugged into a cable 54. Cable 54 is the means by which the probe 30 is connected to surface equipment and through which data is sent for the imaging process. Electronic surface equipment for downhole receiver 30 comprises a signal strength display recorder, a modem, and a radio transmitter receiver for sending a reference signal between probes when the probes are operating in the FM mode. To ensure that the probe is centrally located within the borehole, a borehole probe centralizer is fitted to the probe as shown in Fig. 3a. This centralizer includes a proximal end cap 55 which is attached to the probe proximal end cap 52. End cap 55 has a central aperture through which cable 54 may pass. Sleeve 56 fits snugly around the distal end of outer cylinder 40 of probe 30. Attached to both end cap 55 and sleeve 56 are three to four bands 57. These bands 57 are of a strong flexible material such as thin stainless steel. The bands 57 are prestressed to curve convexly outward to contact the inside walls of the borehole. The bands 57 are sufficiently flexible to urge the probe 30 into the borehole s center, and to allow for easy passage of the probe down the borehole. Downhole equipment and surface survey procedures can also be used within the mine, for example, as when unmined seams occur at lower levels than the seam being mined. In this situation, boreholes are drilled from the existing seam to the lower seam and downhole instruments and procedures are employed. The preferred embodiment contemplates modular design of the components of both the downhole probes 30 and the in seam instruments 10 and 20. In this way cost of production is reduced and repair and servicing is simplified. Fig. 4 is a general block diagram of the components, showing the modular design. Table 1 is an equipment identification chart identifying the modular components and Table 2 is a configuration matrix showing the composition of each downhole probe 30 and in seam instrument 10 and 20. Examples of equipment specifications are shown in the following Tables 3 7. Table 3 describes the general system operating parameters. Tables 4 and 5 illustrate the transmitter and receiver specifications, respectively. Table 6 describes the transmitter and receiver antenna characteristics and Table 7 gives the specifications for the modem. Where there is no immediate access to the coal seam, surface imaging is performed using the downhole probes 30 inserted into a series of boreholes around the seam s perimeter. This procedure is represented in Fig. 6. Imaging of the seam is based upon the differential conductivity of coal and the anomalous structure. The conductivity of rock is several orders of magnitude greater than the conductivity of coal. The vertical orientation of the transmitting tuned loop antenna produces a horizontal magnetic field H The tuned loop antennas excite the natural low loss coal seam mode signal in accordance with the following equation 1 where M is the magnetic moment of the transmit antenna, r is the range from the transmitter to the receiver antennas, α is an attenuation constant, h equals the seam height, ε The magnetic moment M is itself dependant on transmit power P Together, these equations indicate that the tuned loop antennas will excite the natural coal seam mode magnetic moment and thus provide the highest magnetic moment resulting in the longest range. Narrow system bandwidth also leads to improved receiver sensitivity and operating range. The receiver sensitivity S 10 dB for a 10 dB IF signal to noise ratio is given by equation 3 where BW Equation 3 thus shows that sensitivity increases as bandwidth decreases. The results of equations 1 , 2 and 3 indicate that continuous wave MF signals are optimum for the geophysical survey instruments. This is because their narrow bandwidth results in signal propagation in coal with the lowest attenuation rate Equation 3 and highest magnetic moment Equations 1 and 2 . The net result is that the operating range of the instruments is maximized at a specified output power. The imaging method is dependent on a comparison of the calculated signal strength with the measured signal strength as determined by the CW, MF instruments. An analysis of the calculated signal strength is helpful to an understanding of the method. To provide a baseline reading for the imaging method, Equation 1 , previously referred to, is used to calculate the expected signal strength in a particular coal seam. This is accomplished by measuring the various parameters at the particular seam and applying these results to Equation 1 . When greater resolution is desired tomographic, rather than continuity imaging techniques are employed. Tomography results in high resolution by employing the lowest attenuation rate frequency and making more frequent spatial measurements. The attenuation rates are measured at each spatial orientation of transmitter and receiver and the resulting data points are analyzed using computer aided imaging techniques to yield a pictorial representation of the anomaly. To obtain good resolution, the distance between the transmitter and receiver should be greater than λ The in seam tomographic imaging method as illustrated in Fig. 5, accordingly is carried out with portable entry receiver 10 and transmitter 20 in a manner determined to maximize resolution. Tuned loop antenna 21 of transmitter 20 is designed to excite the natural coal seam mode azimuthal magnetic field component H Surface based seam imaging equipment is deployed as shown in Fig. 6. The coal seam to be imaged is represented by general reference character 80. It can be seen that a fault 82 is present within the seam. In employing the surface base imaging procedure using a perimeter exploration protocol a plurality of drill holes 84 are drilled along the perimeter of the longwall panels. In the preferred embodiment two adjacent longwall panels, of a combined width of 366m 1200 ft and a length of 1829 m 6000 ft can be imaged with a ten hole drilling plan. Such a drilling plan will detect seam anomalies within the panels. If a fault is detected in the panel a convergent search strategy is required to determine its heading. Such a search strategy is carried out by drilling bisecting boreholes within the perimeter to localize the fault. Surface imaging of the coal seam is accomplished in a manner similar to the in seam imaging procedure. After the series of drill holes have been bored around the perimeter of the longwall panel, the surface probes 30 are inserted down the boreholes 84 to the depth of the coal seam which has been determined from the core samples. Fig. 6 illustrates a vertical displacement fault which results in one end of the coal seam being deeper then the other. Because the signals tend to propagate through the coal, the receiver probe 30 is placed within the coal seam and not necessarily at the same depth as the transmitter probe 30. Downhole probes 30, comprising a receiver probe and a transmitter probe are inserted in opposite drill holes 84. Receiver and transmitter antenna segments 48 are aligned in a co planar manner by means of drive motors 49 located in the end of downhole probes 30. Antenna headings are determined and controlled through the use of surface control units 85 including telemetry and control equipment and a modem. These units, together with the probe control equipment and cabling, are mounted in trucks 86. Continuous wave FM medium frequency CWMF transmissions are made in a manner similar to those made in the in seam imaging procedure and attenuation rate and or phase shift are measured. The process is repeated with the receiver probe 30 and transmitter probe 30 in each of the boreholes 84. This surface procedure may also be carried out from an underground surface. This situation occurs when a lower coal seam is being explored from an existing mined seam. The existing seam floor then becomes the surface into which boreholes are drilled for exploration of the lower seam. The downhole probes 30 are inserted into the boreholes and measurements taken in the normal surface exploration manner. The resultant continuity data are analyzed to determine if areas of increased attenuation are present. Such areas indicate fault zones or other geological anomalies. If sufficient boreholes are drilled, the data can be analyzed using computer aided tomographic imaging techniques to yield a pictorial result as with the in seam procedure. Additionally, floor roof rock characteristics can be determined using continuous wave medium frequency continuity measurements. This procedure is analogous to the downhole seam continuity measurements except the receiver and transmitter probes 30 are positioned above the coal seam ceiling to measure roof conditions, and just below the floor to measure floor conditions. The signals are thus propagated through the surrounding rock, and signal attenuation is measured. In this way a determination respecting the type of rock and resulting roof floor conditions can be made. Roof rock characteristics can also be determined by placing the in seam receiver 10 and transmitter 20 within the tail gate and head gate entries 76 and 78 at very close intervals, for example, on the order of 7.6 m 25 ft and analyzing the resulting data using a backplane and or reconstruction algorithm to develop an isopach map of constant attenuation rates. Fig. 7 illustrates a method for imaging roof rock conditions in a developing entry 100, which is mined between the existing entries 76 and 78. The receiver 10 is placed at a series of locations X₀, X₁...X Fig. 8 illustrates a survey procedure using a single transmitter 20 and multiple receivers 10 placed within the coal seam 70. This procedure speeds up acquisition of the necessary data, and works equally well with a single receiver 10 and multiple transmitters 20 or multiple receivers 10 and transmitters 20. Numerous variations on the in seam and downhole survey techniques can be utilized for specific purposes. As illustrated in Fig. 9, the downhole probes 30 may be used in conjunction with an in seam receiver 10 and or transmitter 20 in a crosshole survey method to obtain high resolution imaging of anomalies that may exist in a virgin local seam 102 next to the developing entry 100. Backplane reconstruction and or tomography algorithms may be used to analyze the resulting data. Fig. 9 also illustrates a method for measuring seam heights along a horizontal in seam drillhole 104. This method makes use of the crosshole method using an in seam transmitter 20, and a downhole type probe 30 which is inserted into the horizontal drillhole 104, which is drilled perpendicular to a transmitter survey line A. The receiver 30 is laterally displaced within the drillhole 104 and signal attenuation readings are taken at various points for each of a plurality of transmitter locations designated as Y₀, Y₁,...Y Anomalies detected by any of the foregoing survey methods can be verified by a comparison of direct and reflected signals. A transmitter, which may be the in seam instrument 20 or the downhole instrument 30, is positioned in the seam 70, as illustrated in Fig. 10, to propagate continuous wave MF signals towards the anomaly 74. A receiver, either the in seam instrument 10 or the downhole probe 30 is positioned adjacent to the transmitter to receive a reflected signal from the anomaly 74. A signal from a transmitter receiver loop antenna 111 is propagated by a first port of a directional coupler 112 and then to the anomaly 74, which reflects part of the signal. The reflected signal enters a second port of the coupler 112 via the antenna 111, and within the coupler 112 a comparison of direct and reflected signal power is made. The presence of the anomaly 74 will cause an increase in reflected power over that reflected by the seam 70. Once an anomaly has been imaged in a coal panel 70, its effect on longwall mining can be ameliorated by separating the longwall into pieces, for example a first piece which would avoid the anomaly and a second piece which would run into it. A take down room and a set up room are mined, using continuous mining techniques, on either side of the anomaly and perpendicular to the longwall heading. The entire longwall is operated until the second part enters the take down room, at which point this part is taken down and reset in the set up room. The first part of the longwall meanwhile continues to operate and is relinked with the second part on the far side of the anomaly. An alternative to allow uninterrupted longwall mining of the panel is to fracture the anomaly by any means known in the art, for example, by fracking with high pressure injections of mud, or high expansion rosins, or by conventional blasting. Boreholes on the order of 518 m 1700 ft or more are costly and time consuming to drill and expensive to case. The lack of casing causes the hole to close after the drill stem is removed. For such boreholes, an alternative embodiment of the probe 30, illustrated in schematic in Fig. 11, may be utilized. These probes, designated by the reference character 120 essentially comprise a loop antenna 48 , a motor 49 mechanically coupled to the antenna 42 for rotating the antenna 42 about a vertical axis, a voltage level calibrator circuit 121 and a cable 122 for coupling to a power and control means 123. The surface power and control unit 123 includes transmitter and or receiver circuitry for delivering signals to or receiving signals from the loop antenna 48 . Both electrical power and intelligence signals are carried from the unit 123 to the probe 120, and intelligence signals are carried back to the unit 123, via the cable 122. The voltage level calibrator circuit 121 generates a precision signal level for calibrating the entire signal path from the antenna to the control means 123. The probe 120 can be left in the borehole for extended time periods while a drilling protocol is completed, and may be used at any time as desired. The probe 120 may also include a security code lock circuit 124 in order to prevent unauthorized use of the probe 100. Typically, the probes 120 will be inserted into the borehole through PVC piping, or they may be inserted directly through the drill stem. The pipe or stem is subsequently removed, leaving the probe 120 in place in the borehole. Various alterations and modifications will no doubt become apparent to those skilled in the art after having read the disclosure. Accordingly, it is intended that the appended claims be interpreted as covering all alterations and modifications as fall within the scope of the invention.
