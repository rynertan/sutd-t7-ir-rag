# VIBRATING SCREENING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A novel vibratory screening apparatus particularly adapted for the wet screening of slurry mixtures containing particles and liquids, and more particularly to the separation of solid particles and liquids utilizes in combination a combined vibratory screening deck having a sieve bend portion upstream of an inclined substantially planar portion to effect substantial dewatering of the slurry mixture as it flows across the screening deck.
