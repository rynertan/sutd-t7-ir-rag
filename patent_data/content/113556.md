# Apparatus and method for pattern location.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for location of a pattern within a digital representation of an image. A video camera 20 scans an image of light reflected from the surface of an object 22 . The analog output 35 of the video camera 20 is digitized to form the digital representation. In order to digitize the analog output 35 a threshold signal 100 is provided. A comparator 40 receives both the threshold signal 100 and the analog output 35 . When the difference between the threshold signal 100 and analog output 35 exceeds a predetermined value the comparator 40 changes its output from one digital level to another until the difference is less than the predetermined value. The threshold signal 100 is produced by an adaptive threshold circuit 110 which integrates the analog output 35 over one scan of the image to form an integrated signal. This integrated signal is normalized and stored in a sample and hold circuit 90 for use in a subsequent scan as the threshold signal 100 . The reference pattern is compared with a preselected search area of the digital representation. After an attempt is made to locate the pattern within the preselected search area, another search area having a size different from the prior preselected search area is selected in response to the location or failure to locate the predetermined pattern within the preselected search area.

## Description
Apparatus and D1ethoa for Location of a Predetermined Pattern Background of the InventionField of the Invention. The invention relates to the location of patterns within an image, and more particularly, the invention relates to the location of patterns by utilizing an apparatus and method adapted to vary the size of the area searched for the pattern.Description of the prior art. Pattern location systems for locating predetermined patterns within an image are known in the art.A type of location system is shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,776,447 issued to Adams et al on December 4, 1973, and entitled Automatic Saniconduetor Bonding Machines . In Adams, an object is located and that information is utilized to position a tool for operation on the object.The object in Adams is a semiconductor integrated circuit, and the tool is the bonding head of wire bonder. In general, a pattern location system determines the location of a pattern within an image by comparing portions of the image with a reference pattern. The image is observed by a video camera. The video camera is positioned to be incident to light reflected from the object. The camera scans the light it receives and produces an analog output Which corres ponies to The image of the object present in the reflected light. Typically the video camera produces a raster scan of the light reflected from the object.The analog output produced by the video camera has an amplitude varying in proportion to the magnitude of the reflected light at the corresponding location within the image. The light reflected from the object is repeatedly electronically scanned by the video camera. The analog output of the video camera is digitized and the digital output produced is usually stored in a memory. then the analog output is digitized, a certain amplitude is selected. The analog output is sampled at a known rate. If the amplitude of the analog output when sampled exceeds the certain amplitude, a digital signal of one level is generated. If the amplitude of the analog output when sampled is less than or equal to the certain amplitude, a digital signal of another level is generated. As the digital signals are generated they form a digital output which is stored into a video memory. The storage of the digital output is such that the relationship between the individual digital and the corresponding location of the digital signal within the image is known and maintained. The digital image within the video memory is com pared with a stored reference image. The comparison is usually repeated as the image within the video memory is shifted relative to the reference image.The best match between the reference image, which is the predetermined pattern, is found by the repeated comparisons. The location of the pattern within the video image is noted and the information transferred to an alignment apparatus. The align apparatus is then actuated and the position of the object relative to a tool is altered. An X Y table can be utilized for this purpose. The motors attached to the table can be actuated and the relative position of the object and tool altered. The motors are usually driven by a displacement device which utilizes the location of the pattern within the stored image to determine the distance and direction of the relative movement necessary to bring the predetermined pattern on the object to a desired position relative to the tool. None of the prior constructions shows an apparatus and method of pattern location utilizing an adaptive threshold for determining if the digital output produced from the analog output of a video camera is of one digital level or another digital level. Summary of the Invention The apparatus and method for pattern location disclosed herein includes a video camera producing an analog output of a scan, which can be a raster scan, of the light incident thereto. The video camera is located along an optical path incident to light reflected from the surface of an object. The surface of the object has several features including a predetermined pattern. It is this predetermined pattern which the apparatus is adapted to locate. As the incident light reflected from the surface of the object is received by the video camera, the camera produces an analog output having an amplitude varying proportionally to the magnitude of the light within the image of the surface at the location within the image corresponding to that section of the analog output.In other words, as the video camera scans the incident light reflected from the object, the analog output produced by the video camera varies in proportion to the magnitude of the light observed by the camera as the image within the incident light is scanned. The analog output of the video camera is connected to the digitizer circuit which converts the analog output to a digital output comprising one of two levels. The analog output is compared to a threshold signal to determine which of the two digital levels the magnitude of the analog output represents. The analog output is also connected to an integrator circuit which produces an output which represents the integral of the magnitude of the analog output of the video camera over time. The integrator can be connected to integrate only a selected portion of the scanned image called hereinafter a window . The integrated output of the integrator is normalized by performing an analog division or fractional multiplying operation which adjusts the integrated output according to the size of the window. The larger the window the larger the divisor to produce a normalized output Which is independent of the size of the window. The integrated and normalized output can be connected through a manually adjustable potentiometer to the input of an analog sample and hold circuit. The sample and hold circuit can be actuated after each scan to output the updated value of the integrated and normalized output. The output of the sample and hold is the threshold signal. That is the integrated and normalized output is latched into the sample and hold circuit to become its output. The threshold signal produced by the example and hold circuit is connected to one input of a comparitor.The other input of the comparitor is connected to the analog output of the video camera. The comparitor produces one digital level when the analog output of the video camera has a preselected relationship with the threshold signal and another digital level when the analog output of the video camera does not have the preselected relationship with the threshold signal. The preselected relationship can be, for example, the difference in magnitude between the analog output and the threshold signal. When the difference in magnitude is equal to or exceeds a certain value, the comparitor produces one digital level, and when the difference in magnitude is less than the certain value1 the other digital level is produced. The output of the comparitor is connected to a video synchronization circuit. The synchronization circuit samples the output of the comparitor at a known rate and in regard to the vertical and horizontal synchronization signals . The serial output of the sampling is loaded into a shift register for conversion to a parallel word format. The parallel words are transferred to and stored into a video memory.The method and arrangement of storage is under computer control to insure that a proper relationship between the storage locations of the parallel words and the image of the surface of the object within the reflected light is maintained. In other words the relationship of each bit of the parallel words and the locations represented by each bit within the image is known. A reference representation of the predetermined pattern is contained in a reference memory. The reference representation can, for example, be loaded into the reference memory from the video memory by direction of an operator during a setup procedure.In fact the operator can select the predetermined pattern. Once the predetermined pattern is selected and stored, the apparatus of the present invention can locate the predetermined pattern on the surfaces of a plurality of objects which are sequentially presented to the view of the video camera. The video memory and the reference memory are connected to a correlator. The correlator compares the reference pattern with the video representation stored in the video memory. The video representation is shifted by the correlator to determine the best match between the video representation and the reference pattern. The best match can be determined by finding the location within the video representation which has the fewest mismatches with the reference pattern. Once the best match is determined the location is stored and the predetermined pattern again located within the video representation utilizing a refined procedure if desired, The refined procedure makes use of the location of the patter n determined in the prior procedure.The relative shifting of the reference pattern and the video representation is less for each attempted match. Prior to performing the refined procedure the computer determines if the accumulated mismatches for the best match is sufficiently small that it representations the results of an actual location of the predetermined pattern on the object. The window discussed above is set by the computer.If the predetermined pattern is within the window, the computer can reduce the area of the window to another preselected size for the next object. If the predetermined pattern is not within the window, then the computer can enlarge the size of the area of the window.Then a new correlation procedure is attempted. This enlarged window size is also used in the correlation procedure for the new object. The apparatus of the present invention can be utilized to locate more than one predetermined pattern on the surface of an object. The first pattern is located and its location is stored within the computer.The second pattern is located, utilizing a different window, and its location is stored within the computer.The computer then determines the differences between the actual location of the patterns and stored reference locations. This allows the computer to calculate the displacement in the X and Y directions and the angular displacement. The displacements are then supplied to a displacement control for an X Y table which supplies relative movement between the object and a tool. If it is not necessary to have the angular displacement then the location apparatus need only locate one predetermined pattern and supply the displacement control with the displacement in theX and Y directions resulting from the location of only that one predetermined pattern. The computer can act as the displacement control if desired. It is an advantage of the present invention to provide an adaptive threshold circuit within a pattern location apparatus. It is another advantage of the present invention to provide an adaptive threshold circuit which is adapted. to determine a proper threshold for comparison to a video analog output during a single scan of a video camera. A further advantage of the present invention is to provide an adaptive threshold circuit which is capable of determining a proper threshold signal for comparison to an analog output from a video camera by integrating a single scan of the analog output. Another advantage of the present invention is to provide a window of a size selected from a plurality of areas for storing the digitized output of the video camera representing the area within the window of the image presented to the camera. An additional advantage of the present invention is to provide a predetermined pattern location apparatus which can locate predetermined patterns of different sizes by storing a reference representation of the predetermined pattern having different sizes as selected. Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1 is a detailed block diagram of an adaptive threshold circuit, Figure 2 is a block diagram of a system for pattern location Figure 3 is a logic diagram of a portion of the operation of the system of Figure 2 and Figure 4 is a logic diagram of a portion of the operation of the system of Figure 2. Description of the Preferred Embodiment With reference to the drawings and in particular to Figure 1 thereof, a video canera 20 is focused to observe an object 22 which can be, for example, a semiconductor integrated circuit. The object 22 is positioned on an X Y table 24 Which is movable by motors 26 and 27. Motors 26 and 27 are connected through lines 30 and 31, respectively, to a displacement control which supplies the necessary positioning signals to motors 26 and 27 through line 30 and 31, respectively. Associated with table 24 is a tool not shown in Figure 1 .Table 24 provides relative movement between the tool and object 22. The purpose of The system shown herein is to locate a predetermined pattern on object 22 to determine any positioning error between the actual position of object 22 relative to the tool and a desired relative position. An example of a tool and various displacement controls are shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,776,447 issued on December 4, 1973, to Adams et al and entitled Automatic Semiconductor Bonding Machine , U.S. Patent No. 4,352,125 issued on September 28, 1982, to Guth and entitled Recognition Apparatus 1 and U.S. Patent two. 3,539,256 issued on November 10, 1970, to Ables and entitled Step and Repeat Camera with ComputerControlled Film Table , which are incorporated by reference herein. Camera 20 can be of the raster scanning t pe and produces an analog output of the light reflected from object 22 during each scan of the plurality of optical scans. As camera 20 scans object 22, the magnitude of the analog output produced is proportional to the light received from the point on object 22 currently being scanned. Thus an image of object 22 which is comprised of the light reflected from object and as shown in Figure 1 the upper surface thereof is converted to analog output of varying amplitude. The analog output of camera 20 is connected through line 35 as an input to a semiconductor switch 37 and a comparitor 40. Switch 37 is closed by a signal on line 43. When switch 37 is closed, the analog output of camera 20 is connected an an input to operational amplifier 48 through line 50. Line 50 is also connected to one side of a capacitor 52. The output of operational amplifier 48 is connected through line 54 to the input of an analog multiplier 56 which is a multiplexing DAC and to the side of capacitor 52 away from its connection to line 50. A semiconductor switch 60 is connected across the sides of capacitor 52. WÇhen switch 50 is closed by a signal on line 62 from the Q input of flip flop 64, capacitor is effectively shorted and the stored charge on the capacitor 54 is discharged through switch 60. 9 This occurs when a new scan is commenced and is initiated by the placement of appropriate signals on lines 68 and 70. The desired result is that switch 60 is closed while the vertical scan signal to camera 20 is being reset to initiate a new scan for a sufficient period to discharge capacitor 52. Analog multiplier 56 also receives inputs through multiline channel 74. Ene analog input from opera tional amplifier 48 connected through line 54 to analog multiplier 56 is multiplied by an amount determined by the digital inputs to analog multiplier 56 through channel 74. The output of analog multi plier 56 is connected through line 78 to one end of a potentiometer 82, which has its other opposite end connected to ground. The contact of potentiometer 82 is connected through line 85 to the input of a sample and hold circuit 90. Sample and hold circuit 90 also receives an input from line 95. The output of sample and hold circuit is connected through line 100 to the negative input of comparitor 40 with line 35 from camera 20 connected to the positive input of comparitor 40. The output of comparitor 40 is connected to line 105. In operation, the adaptive threshold circuit 110 of Figure 1 receives the analog output of camera 20.Switch 37 is closed to allow selected portions of the analog output of camera 20 to be received as inputs by amplifier 48. The selected portions correspond to a cross sectional area of the image reflected from the object 22. In other words, only the analog output from camera 20 corresponding to a selected portion of the surface of object 22 is connected to the input of amplifier 48 under the control of switch 37. The selected area could if desired comprise the entire surface of object 22 or any lesser part thereof.Operational amplifier 48 and capacitor comprise an integrator 114. The output of operational anpli fier 48 after a scan of object 22 is a representation of the entire amount of light reflected from the selected area within the window controlled by switch 37 as received by camera 20. The analog multiplier 56 acts to reduce the amplitude of the signal received from amplifier 48. The fractional value supplied on channel 74 is determined by the size of the window.The analog multiplier 56 comprises a normalizer 117.Thus, amplifier 48 produces an integrated signal and and multiplier 56 produces a normalized signal. The normalized output of multiplier 56 provides an updated value with which the analog output of the camera 20 can be compared. Potentiometer 82 provides a manual adjust for the threshold signal if desired. After the scan is completed, the output of potentiometer 82 is stored into sample and hold circuit 90 for use during the next scan.After the output of potentiometer 82 is stored into sample and hold circuit 90 switch 60 can be closed to reset the integrator 114 for the next scan. us, an adaptive threshold circuit is provided which allows an updated threshold level to be available to comparitor 40 after each scan which allows rapid adjustments to changes in the light level and to differences in the amount of light reflected from different cbjects which replace object 22 but are substantially identical therewith. The output of comparitor 40 is one of two digital levels. The digital level selected is determined by a preselected relationship between the analog output of camera 20 and the threshold signal from sample and hold circuit 90. For example, comparitor 40 can produce a high signal when the magnitude of the analog output of camera 20 is equal to or exceeds the magnitude of the threshold signal from sample and hold circuit 90. Comparitor 40 can then produce a low signal when the magnitude of the analog output of camera 20 is less than the magnitude of the threshold signal of sample and hold circuit 90. As shown in Figure 2, a video synchronization circuit 130 has as outputs lines 43, 68, 70 and 95, and channel 74. A plurality of flt flops 134 is provided within circuit 130 to allow the proper signals to be set thereinto as determined by the logic within circuit 130 as directed by computer 140. The necessary logic within circuit 130 can be standard controller logic with appropriate counters and storage elements or a microcontroller. Channel 74 is also connected to a plurality of flip flops or a register within circuit 130. However, the appropriate sequenceing and or nature of the outputs of circuit 130 to lines 43, 68, 70, and 95, and channel 74 has been discussed above in connection with Figure 1.Line 105 from the output of comparitor 40 Figure 1 is connected to the input of shift register 145. An appropriate clock signal is provided on line 147 to insure that each line of the scan is divided into the proper number of digital signals. The digital signals are clocked into the shift register 145 which is a 74LS347 until it is full and then the contents of the shift register 145 is transferred into the video memory circuit 152 for storage into the video memory 154 as a digital representation of the image observed by camera 20 Figure 1 . The output of shift register 145 is connected to a multiline channel 160. Channel 1 60 is also connected to a bidirectional tri state buffer 165 which is a 74LS245 . It should be noted that certain components have a specific commercial designator associated therewith.The purpose is to provide the reader with additional information as to the nature of the components where appropriate. Channel 160 is connected to bidirectional tri stage buffer 170 within video memory circuit 152 and to bidirectional tri state buffer 173 within reference memory circuit 180. Channel 160 is also connected to registers 185 and 187 located within correlator 195. The buffer 1 65 is also connected to multiline channel 200 on its side away from its connection to channel 160.

CPU 227 is connected through multiline channel 240 to register 243 within video memory circuit 152.CPU 228 is connected through multiline channel 246 to sequencer 250within reference memory circuit 180. The CPU 205 has its data external data lines connected to channel 200. The address lines ofCPU 205 are connected to multi line channel 254.Channel 254 is also connected to video synchronization circuit 130 for storing information for control purposes therein. Channel 254 is connected to multiplexer 256 which is a 74LS157 within video memory circuit 152 and to multiplexer 259 which is a 74us157 . The output of shift register 145 is stored into video memory 154 to form a digital representation of the image observed by camera or at least a portion of the image within a window set by the CPU.The CPU can set through line 266 connected to control buffer 170 the necessary control to allow it to store the output of shift register 145 into video memory 154. Hc ever, in normal operation the sequencer 250, which is a microcontroller cconibined with peripheral logic circuits, performs the task of storing the output of shift register 145 into video memory 154 through line 269 which is connected to one input ofAND gate 272 and to the control input of multiplexer 256. With an appropriate signal on line 269, when video synchronization circuit 130 indicates on line 275 that shift register 145 is full and prepared to transfer information buffer 170 is connected to receive the output of register 145. Sequencer 250 is adapted to provide a nuiriber of control signals to various other elements within the system of Figure 2. The sequencer receives instructi ons from the CPU 205 through channel 246 andCRU 228. The sequencer provides the necessary control signals to address counter 280 through multiline channel 285.These signals would include a clock signal indicating that the counter should increment. The function of buffer 1 73 is controlled by line 290 connected to sequencer 250. The side of buffer 1 73 away from its connection to channel 160 is connected to reference memory 295 and a latch 300 which is an 74LS273 . The latch function of latch 300 is controlled by sequencer 250 through line 305. The sequencer 250 receives inputs from lines 312 and 313 connected to search area unit 316 within video memory circuit 152 and to comparitor 320 within cbrrelator 195.In addition, sequencer 250 has outputs connected through lines 324, 326, and 328 to registers 185 and 187, to accumulator 332 within correlator 195, and to registers 235 and 243, respectively. Sequencer 250 also supplies a carry bit through line 335 to adder 338 within video memory circuit 152. The output of address counter 280 is connected through multi line channel 345 as an input to multiplexer 259 and adder 338. The output of latch 300 is connected through multi line channel 350 as an input to a paral1el exclusìve OR circlet 353 within ccrrelato 195. The search area unit 316 is connected to channel 150 to receive data from the CPU for storage into registers 360 363. The registers 3S0 363 contain the X and Y coordinates for the searer area within the representation stored in video memory 154. The coordinates contain the address of the first X and the first Y memory location to be transferred from video memory 154 through channel 254 to registers 185 and 187. These registers also contain the coordinates of the last memory location to be transferred. When the last part of the representation has been transferred to registers 185 and 187, the search area unit so indicates to sequencer 250 through line 312.The search area unit 31 6 is connected through multiline channel 370 to adder 338 and to register 243. The search area unit 316 supplies the base coordinates to adder 338, which are combined with the address from address counter 280 to produce the appropriate address within video memory 154. The output of adder 338 is connected through multiline channel 375 as an input to multiplexer 256. ltChen selected by sequencer 250 the address produced by adder 338 is connected to the addressirg inputs of video memory 154 through multiplexer 256. The output of multiplexer 256 is connected to the address inputs of video memory 154 tnrough multiline channel 380. The data lines of video memory 154 are connected through multi line channel 385 to the side of buffer 170 away from its connection to channel 160. The addressing inputs of reference memory 295 are connected through multi line channel 390 to the output of multiplexer 259. The data lines of reference memory 295 are connected through multi line channel 395 to the side of buffer 173 away from its connection to channel 160 and as an input to latch 300. The output of search area unit 316 connected to multi line channel 400 is connected to the barrel shifter 405 within correlator 195 as an input. The barrel shifter 405 is connected through multichannel 410 to registers 185 and 187. The output of barrel shifter 405 is connected through multiline channel 415 to exclusive CW circuit 353. The output of exclusive OR circuit 353 is connected to counter 420 through multiline channel 425. The output of counter 420 is connected through multiline channel 430 to accumulator 332. A multiline channel 435 connects the output of accumulator 332 to comparitor 320 and to register 235. In operation, the operator initiated a setup procedure zilch defines the predetermined pattern. A scan of the object is stored into the video memory under the control of computer 140. The operator then positions a cursor on a monitor not shown and defines the predetermined pattern and supplies the size of the predetermined pattern. If more than one predetermined pattern is to be utilized, then the additional pattern is defined by the operator. The computer then stores the predetermined pattern or patterns into reference memory 295. The pattern location system is now ready to locate the predetermined pattern located on an object presented to the camera.When the object is mechanically positioned, the video synchronization circuit is initiated and a scan o the object is stored into the video memory 1 54. The computer loads the search area coordinates into registers 360 363. The sequencer 250 is informed by the computer of the size of the predetermined pattern stores in reference memory 295. The location of the predetermined pattern then begins. The initial part of the search arena is loaded into registers 185 and 187 utilizing the address supplied by the adder 338.The search area unit provides the shifting information to barrel shifter 405. The output of the shifter 405 is compared with the initial part of the predetermined pattern latched into latch 300 by exclusive OR gate 353. The address supplied by the address counter 280 is utilized to address the reference mt llory 295 for latching into latch 300. The number of mitches is located by exclusive OR gate 353 and is counted by counter 420 as the representation in viaeo memory 154 representing a row or column of video.After completing the row or column, the total of the mismatches is summed into accumulator 332. After every row or column is examined, the output of the accumulator is compared with the contents of register 235. If the contents of register 235 is greater than the contents of accumulator, the contents of accumulator 332 is loaded into register 235 and the address of that location within video memory 154 is loaded into register 243. The operation continues until the best match is located. The computer than accesses the registers 243 and 232 to determine if the result meets certain preselected criterion. If the location is determined to be valid, the computer can specify a refined search in which the search area unit has startling coordinates closer to the location in register 243 and a smaller bit shift address output to barrel shifter 405. As shove in Figure 3, a logic diagram describes a portion of the operation of the computer 140 if it is desired to locate two predetermined patterns. This operation begins in logic step 450 and exits step 450 to enter logic state 452. In state 452 the location of the first predetermined pattern is detected if possible. If the location is not found then the logic enters logic step 454. In step 454 the search area is enlarged. The logic then reenters state 452 and another attempt to locate the first predetermined pattern is made. If the pattern is found the logic exits state 453 and enters state 456. In state 456, the location of the second predetermined pattern is detected if possible.If the location is not found then the logic enters logic step 458 where the search area is enlarged. The logic then reenters state 456. If the second predetermined pattern is found the logic exits state 456 and enters step 460.In step 460 the computer calculates the differences between the actual location of the predetermined patterns and the desired location. This information is supplied to the displacement control discussed above.That information includes the X and Y displacement and any angular displacement. The logic then exits step 460 and enters step 462 which ends this procedure. In Figure 4, a logic step 470 begins a procedure of the computer. The logic exits step 470 and enters logic state 472. In state 472 the computer determined if the predetermined pattern was located within the initial search area. If the predetermined pattern was not located within the initial search area, the logic exits state 472 and enters step 474. In step 47L, the search is enlarged to another selected area from a plurality of selectable areas Zor the next object presented to camera 20 Figure 1 .The logic then exits step 474 ana enters step 476 wherein the computer continues witb other procedures. If while the logic is in state 472 the pattern was located within the initial search area, the logic exits state L72 and enters step 478. In step 478 the search area is reduced to another selected area selected from a plurality of selectable search areas.The logic then enters step 476. Having described the invention in connection with certain specific einbodiments thereof, it is to be understood that further modifications may now suggest themselves to those skilled in the art1 it is intended to cover all such modIfications as fall within the scope of the appended claims.
