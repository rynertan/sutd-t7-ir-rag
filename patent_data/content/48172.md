# Process for producing dialkyl phosphorochloridothionates.

## Abstract
A process of producing dialkylphosphorochlorodithion ates of the general formula RO â‚‚ Cl where R is lower alkyl having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms by the chlorination of dialkyl dithiophosphoric acid in which the chlorine added after the addition of from .63 to .86 moles of chlorine per mole of phosphorodithioic acid is diluted with an inert gas. The process improves product yields and purity and provides for simple HCl recovery.
