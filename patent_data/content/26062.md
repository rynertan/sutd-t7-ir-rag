# A heterojunction semiconductor laser.

## Abstract
A heterostructure semiconductor laser 40 is character ized by having a channeled mesa 44 contiguous with the top surface 55 of the laser substrate 52 . The channeled mesa 44 comprises an elongated mesa with an elongated channel 50 formed in the top surface 47, 49 of the mesa structure. The epitaxial growth of semiconductor layers over the chan neled mesa produces layers having uniform thickness with smooth facet like texture and without layer surface irregularities. The channeled mesa may also be employed in the fabrication of nonplanar large optical cavity lasers.
