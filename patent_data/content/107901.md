# Method and apparatus for identifying radar targets.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method of and apparatus for identifying a selected radar target in which an initial interrogation radar pulse is transmitted from a base station and received at the selected target x and any other such radar targets y z at which it is applied to a respective responder causing the responder to generate a monitor response signal x1, x2, y1, y2, z1, z2 with a pulse separation tr not less than the duration of an identification signal. Each said target x, y, z receives one or more monitor response signals x1,.... z2 from the other radar target responders. Any monitor response signals y1, y2, z1, z2 received partly overlapping the monitor response signal x1, x2 of any of said radar targets are detected and a garble flag means set thereat. The base station detects any garbling between monitor response signals received from the selected radar target and any other such radar target whereupon it transmits a supression radar signal to suppress radar targets y, z having different, garble flag conditions from the selected radar target x until all the other radar targets have been suppressed y, z and then transmits at least two, identification signal portion seeking, interrogation radar signals and processes the identification signal portions received from the unsuppressed selected radar target so as to produce a signal containing all of the data concerning the specific individual identity of said selected radar target x.
