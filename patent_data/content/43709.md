# A VEHICLE AND A CONTROL DEVICE FOR CONTROLLING THE OPERATION OF A VEHICLE

## Abstract
A vehicle 10 having a drive engine 11, a fuel injection pump 34 for supplying fuel to the engine at a variable rate, an accelerator pedal 33 for controlling the rate of fuel supplied to the engine, and sensing means 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22 for sens ing various vehicle parameters, comprises a collapsible link 30 connected in the connection 32 between the accelerator pedal 33 and the injector pump 34. The collapsible link 30 has an electro magnetically operated latch for restraining collapsing of the collapsible link 30 under normal conditions. Upon the occurrence of an abnormal or undesirable condition, such as, for example, excessive accelerator pedal depression, the latch will be operative in response to the various sensors to cause the collapsible link 30 to collapse, thereby reducing the maxi mum amount of power available to the driver.
