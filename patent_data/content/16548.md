# Fuel control system for an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
An i.c. engine fuel control system includes a closed loop roughness control, utilizing a roughness sensor circuit 11, 12, 13, 14 , an integrator 15 which integrates the error between the roughness signal and a reference signal and modifies the fuel flow to the engine via a main fuel control 19 with a variable frequency clock 18 . During acceleration and decel eration the closed loop is interrupted by means of a circuit including two differentiators 24, 25 which are sensitive to throttle opening speed demand and actual speed respec tively, and switches 16, 30 controlled by these differen tiators.
