# Rubber steel composite article, e.g. a vehicle tire including at least one steel reinforcing element.

## Abstract
In a vehicle tire, steel reinforcing elements are bonded to vulcanised rubber by an adhesive composition. In order to avoid the problem of failure of adhesion with time arising for instance when brass plated steel is used, bright unplated steel is used, and the adhesive is a rubber free composition comprising a heat reacted resole resin of a phenol and formaldehyde wherein the ratio of phenol to formaldhyde is from 1 1 to 1 6. Up to 60 phr of silica may be included to improve adhesion The rubber may contain up to 30 phr of heat reacted phenolic resin.
