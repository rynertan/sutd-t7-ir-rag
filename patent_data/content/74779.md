# Protected pigments.

## Abstract
Pigments which are unstable at high temperatures are protected by inclusion in zirconium silicate crystals. Im proved protected pigments are produced by the step of precipitating the constituents of the protected pigments from aqueous or non aqueous solution. Especially applicable to pigments for ceramics such as those containing cadmium and pigments for use in plastics where contamination of foodstuffs is to be avoided.
