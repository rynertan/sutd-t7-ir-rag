# ELECTRODE STRUCTURE FOR DISPLAY DEVICE.

## Abstract
Each of the electrodes 5 , 6 , 7 , differing from each other in their degree of rigidity is provided between a cathode 2 and a fluorescent material surface 1 through a connecting spacer 3 , and the electrodes 5 , 6 , 7 , are joined and secured together by firing. In this case, a plurality of kinds of connecting spacers 3 spacers 3 , 3 , 3 , are prepared which differ from each other in thickness ratio between constituent members, i.e., a ground metal 12 , an insulating layer 13 and glass frit 14 within such a range that the quality of each of the constituent members is not changed and there is no change in the distance between the electrodes 5 , 6 , 7 , different in rigidity from each other. Each of the plurality of kinds of connecting spacers 3 is employed, and the electrodes 5 , 6 , 7 , and the connecting spacers 3 are joined and secured together by firing in a state wherein the turning moment is cancelled about the neutral axis of an electrode block constituted by the elec trodes 5 , 6 , 7 , different in rigidity from each other, thereby forming an electrode structure for a display device, it is possible to increase the assembling accurancy of the elec trode block. The electrode structure is extremely advan tageous from the viewpoint of the accuracy of positioning of the electrode block in relation to the fluorescent material surface 1 .
