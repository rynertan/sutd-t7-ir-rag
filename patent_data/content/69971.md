# Gate turn off thyristor stack.

## Abstract
A GTO thyristor stack comprises a pair of GTO thyristors 31, 32 41, 42 in parallel connection and a pair of diodes 34, 35 44, 45 in anti parallel connection therewith. The ele ments in one of the GTO thyristor pair and the diode pair are located in the middle of the stack structure and sandwiched by the elements in the other with all the elements stacked in electrical connection. The stack structure is clamped by a pair of clamper members 62, 63 .
