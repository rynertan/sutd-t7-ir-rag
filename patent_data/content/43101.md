# A process for preparing polyarylene polyethers.

## Abstract
Described herein is an improved process for preparing polyarylene polyethers which comprises the steps of a reacting a dihydric phenol with about a stoichiomet ric amount of an alkali metal, or an alkali metal hydride, hydroxide, alkoxide or alkyl compound in the presence of a solvent comprising a sulfone or sulfoxide or mixtures thereof, to form the alkali metal double salt of the dihydric phenol, b removing water from the mixture by codistillation using an azeotrope forming solvent, and c admixing about an equimolar amount of a dinuclear dihalobenzenoid compound and effecting reaction of the dihalobenzenoid compound and the alkali metal double salt of the dihydric phenol in the sulfone or sulfoxide solvent at temperature above about 100 C and below the decomposi tion temperature of the reactants, the solvent s and the polymer formed, wherein the improvement comprises I adding an increment of the sulfone or sulfoxide solvent to a mixture of dihydric phenol and solvent, and then adding the remainder of the sulfone or sulfoxide solvent during step b or II adding an increment of the sulfone or sulfoxide solvent to a mixture of dihydric phenol and solvent and then adding the remainder of the sulfone or sulfoxide solvent to the mixture simultaneously with the alkali metal or alkali metal hydride, hydroxide, alkoxide or alkyl compound, or III adding an increment of the sulfone or sulfoxide solvent to a mixture of the dihydric phenol and solvent, adding another increment of the sulfone or sulfoxide solvent to the mixture simultaneously with the alkali metal or alkali metal hydride, hydroxide, alkoxide or alkyl compound, and then adding the remainder of the sulfone or sulfoxide solvent during step b or at the end of step b . Optionally, a fractionation column may be used to facilitate reaction system dehydration in step I , or II , or III . Also described herein is a novel polyarylene polyether which has a color factor of less than about 20.
