# PEPTIDE ANTIBODIES AND THEIR USE IN DETECTING ONCOGENE PRODUCTS

## Abstract
Antibodies exhibit specificity toward single amino acid differences between proteins. These antibodies may be pro duced by synthesizing a peptide of the appropriate amino acid sequence contained in the protein, immunizing a host with the peptide, and extracting sera from the host to obtain the antibodies. The antibodies and the desired protein are then immunoprecipiated under conditions of partial dena turation to expose the epitope of the protein. The antibodies may be used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.
