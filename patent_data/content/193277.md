# METHOD OF IN VITRO FERTILIZATION

## Abstract
A method for the treatment of infertility is described in volving recruitment of more than one oocyte by a unique and hitherto undescribed combination of gonadrotropins, the harvest of these ooocytes prior to their spontaneous ovula tion and their fertilization by exposure to sperm in vitro so that the resulting conception can be transferred to the uteri of the donors and so overcome several forms of infertility.
