# Method for making electrical cables.

## Abstract
This invention relates to continuous manufacturing of insulated wire and conductor, and in particular to heating cables having cold ends . A process is described by which predetermined lengths of resistance conductor 4 and of cold end conductor 9 are continuously and alternatively jointed together. After insulation and provision of additional protec tive sheaths the continuous composite conductor is cut into cold and heating cables. A conductor jointing process is described.
