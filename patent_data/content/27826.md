# METHOD OF CONNECTING THE LEADS OF AN ARMATURE COIL TO A COMMUTATOR.

## Abstract
A method of connecting armature coil ends by means of an ultrasonic welding process to a plurality of segments arranged peripherally on a shaft and integrally molded to a commutator. When performing ultrasonic welding of the armature coil ends, the ends are vibrated in a direction that will make the axial component of the vibrating force along the shaft less than the connecting force of the mold ing material to the segments, thereby to connect the arma ture coil to the segments. This method is adapted for con necting the armature winding of a rotary electric machine, such as a starter motor, to the commutator thereof.
