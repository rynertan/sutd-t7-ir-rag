## Description
The present invention relates to a ferroelectric liquid crystal composition and a light switching element making use of the ferroelectric liquid crystal composition. More specifically, this invention relates to a ferroelectric chiral smectic liquid crystal composition having a long helical pitch and a light switching element having a quick response property. Liquid crystal compounds are widely used as display materials but most of such liquid crystal display elements are of a TN display mode, in which a liquid crystal material belonging to a nematic phase is used. Since the TN display mode is of a non emissive type, it has characteristic features that it does not give fatigue to eyes, and works with extremely small power consumption. On the other hand, it has such defects that the response is slow, and that display may not be seen depending upon the angle from which it is viewed. Recently, an attempt to improve the liquid crystal material has been made for obviating these defects, particularly for meeting a demand for a quick response of display device. Application of the light switching effect of the Sc phase to display elements provides three characteristic features superior to those of the TN display mode. The first feature is a very quick response The response time is ¹ ₁₀₀ or less than that of a common TN display mode. The second feature is that it provides a memory effect which makes multiplexing drive easy in cooperation with the above mentioned quick response property. The third feature is an easiness in attaining the gray scale or gradation of brightness. In the case of the TN display mode, since the gray scale is attained by controlling the applied voltage, difficult problems involving the dependence of threshold voltage on temperature and the dependence of response time on voltage are encountered. By contrast, in the case of application of the light switching effect of the Sc phase, the gray scale can be attained easily by controlling the polarity inversion time. Thus the latter is very suitable for graphic display or the like. As display methods, two methods can be considered. One of them is a birefringence type which uses two polarizer plates, and the other is a guest host type which uses dichroic dyes. Since the Sc phase has spontaneous electric polarization, molecules turn over by a π rotation around helical axes thereof as the axes of rotation by inverting the polarity of applied voltage. By filling a liquid crystal composition having a Sc phase into a liquid crystal display cell that has been subjected to a surface treatment for aligning liquid crystal molecules parallel to electrode surface, disposing the liquid crystal cell between two polarizers so arranged in advance that the polarization plane of one of the polarizers is parallel to the director of liquid crystal molecules, and inverting the polarity of applied voltage, a bright range of vision and a dark range of vision which are determined by the angle between the polarization planes can be inter exchanged. On the other hand, when the display is operated by guest host mode, a colored range of vision and a colorless range of vision which are determined by the arrangement of polarization plates can be inter exchanged by inverting the polarity of applied voltage. Ferroelectric chiral smectic liquid crystal compounds known today are exemplified in Table 1 see J. Physique, As is apparent from the foregoing description, the first object of this invention is to provide a chiral smectic liquid crystal composition a showing ferroelectricity in a wide temperature range from around room temperature, b having a large spontaneous electric polarization, and c having a long helical pitch. The second object of this invention is to provide a light switching element capable of quick response. The inventors of the present invention have made investigations on liquid compositions mainly comprising a chiral smectic liquid crystal compound, and, as a result, have unexpectedly found that addition of a liquid crystal compound having a nematic phase and or a smectic C phase to a chiral smectic liquid crystal compound can provide a chiral smectic liquid crystal composition showing ferroelectricity in a wide temperature range from around room temperature. Based on this finding, they have completed the present invention. More specifically, in one aspect of this invention, there is provided Figs. 1 and 2 are diagrams showing the values of spontaneous electric polarization and the reciprocal of helical pitch, respectively, in a binary system of a compound A and a compound B as mentioned in the following Figs. 3 and 4 are diagrams of the same kinds as described above in a binary system of a compound C and a compound D as mentioned in the following DETAILED Examples of a chiral smectic liquid crystal compound to be used in the present invention, which has a helical structure and is represented by the general formula I , include the following compounds, i.e. many compounds having a substituent derived from S 2 methylbutanol, S 1 methylheptanol or R 1 methylheptanol as the group having an asymmetric carbon atom and represented by Y in the formula I . The spontaneous electric polarization is 3 to 5 nC cm², which is not so large, as regards compounds having a substituent derived from S 2 methylbutanol and 50 to 100 nC cm², which is very large, as regards compounds having a substituent derived from S or R 1 methylheptanol. In the above mentioned structural formulae, the asterisks are intended to mean that carbon atoms to which they are attached are asymmetric carbon atoms. Thus, the above mentioned liquid crystal compounds having a helical structure are, of course, optically active compounds. Examples of liquid crystal compounds having only a nematic phase as the liquid phase and no helical structure that can be used in the present invention include the following compounds. Examples of liquid crystal compounds having two phases, a nematic phase and a smectic C phase, and no helical structure that can be used in the present invention include the following compounds. Examples of an optically inactive compound racemate having no helical structure that can be used in the present invention include the following compounds. When a liquid crystal compound having only a nematic phase as the liquid phase is added to a chiral smectic liquid crystal compound in the present invention, the mutual compatibility of these two compounds is good, and a region where the composition obtained shows a cholesteric phase appears on the high temperature side of a region where the composition shows a smectic phase. Accordingly, the region of smectic phase is forced to move toward the low temperature side. Thus the lower limit of the Sc phase is lowered. In this case, it is believed that, since lowering of the upper limit of the Sc phase is moderate as compared with that of the lower limit, the temperature range of the Sc phase spreads. For example, in Example 2 given later where 10 by weight of a liquid crystal compound having a nematic phase was added to a chiral smectic liquid crystal composition, the lower limit of the Sc phase was lowered from 27 C to 19 C, while, by contrast, the upper limit of the Sc phase shifted from 59 C to 56 C, which is no substantial change. Thus the region of Sc phase expands. In many cases, there can be found such a content of a nematic liquid crystal compound to be added that the lower limit of the Sc phase is greatly lowered while the upper limit is hardly lowered or is rather elevated. A preferable content of a nematic compound is 1 to 30 by weight of a resulting chiral smectic liquid crystal composition. The lower limit temperature of the Sc phase scarcely changes in case of an addition of less than 1 of a nematic compound. A content of a nematic compound more than 30 by weight of the composition not only provides an extreme lowering of the upper limit of the Sc phase by width of 10 C or more, but also decreases a spontaneous electric polarization of the composition due to addition of the nematic compound showing no ferroelectricity. Accordingly, addition of more than 30 of a nematic liquid crystal compound is not preferred. When the amount of a nematic liquid crystal compound added is 30 or less, the value of spontaneous electric polarization of the composition obtained is not substantially affected. The helical pitch is slightly elongated by addition of a nematic liquid crystal compound. The clearing point of a nematic liquid crystal compound added is desired to be 70 to 250 C. When a nematic liquid crystal compound having a low clearing point, such as or is used, the upper limit of the Sc phase is lowered. This is not preferable. Appearance of the cholesteric phase in the composition is favorable for obtaining a monodomain cell where liquid crystal molecules are uniformly oriented. Gradual cooling of the composition under an electric field applied easily provides a monodomain. A longer helical pitch in the cholesteric phase is preferred since it provides better orientation. This can be accomplished by mixing a chiral liquid crystal compound having a twist sense of helix right handed and a chiral liquid crystal compound having a twist sense of helix left handed. The effect of use of a liquid crystal compound having a smectic C phase which will be hereinafter abbreviated as an Sc phase and no helical structure will now be explained with reference being made to instances. Figs. 1 and 2 shows the dependencies, on concentration, of the value of spontaneous electric polarization Ps and the reciprocal of helical pitch ¹ p of a binary mixture at a measurement temperature T lower by 15 C than the Sc S and R₁ C₈H₁₇O , namely and As is apparent from Figs. 1 and 2, additivity in accordance with the composition of components can be observed either in the value of spontaneous electric polarization or in the reciprocal of helical pitch. When the compound A concentration is 20 by weight, the spontaneous electric polarization is as large as 8.5 nC cm², and the helical pitch is as very long as 33 µm. This suggests that ferroelectric chiral smectic liquid crystal composition having a long helical pitch can be easily obtained. Figs. 3 and 4 shows the dependencies of Ps and ¹ and R₁ C₈H₁₇O , namely and a compound D corresponding to the formula IV in which R₄ C₈H₁₇O and R₅ C₁₀H₂₁O and having no helical structure, namely As is apparent from Figs. 3 and 4, when the compound C concentration is 30 by weight, the value of spontaneous electric polarization is 1.2 nC cm², and the helical pitch is as very long as 7.1 µm. In the same way as in the instance as mentioned before, this suggests that a ferroelectric chiral smectic liquid crystal composition having a long pitch can be easily obtained. The content of a liquid crystal compound having a Sc phase and no helical structure in the liquid crystal composition of this invention is preferably 5 to 95 by weight, more preferably 10 to 90 by weight. When the content of a liquid crystal compound having a Sc phase and no helical structure exceeds 95 by weight, the spontaneous electric polarization of the composition obtained may be impractically decreased even if a chiral smectic liquid crystal compound having a very large spontaneous electric polarization is used as the other component. On the other hand, when the content of a liquid crystal compound having a Sc phase and no helical structure is less than 5 by weight, lowering of the lower limit temperature in the Sc phase of the composition obtained may be impractically small. Where a compound having not so large spontaneous electric polarization, such as a derivative of 2 methylbutanol, is used as a chiral smectic liquid crystal compound, the content of a compound having no helical structure as the other component is preferably 80 by weight or less when consideration is given to the value of spontaneous polarization of the composition. In the present invention, by addition of a liquid crystal compound having a Sc phase and no helical structure to a chiral smectic liquid crystal compound having a very large spontaneous electric polarization, a liquid crystal composition having an elongated helical pitch and a expanded region of Sc phase can be obtained. In general, many of liquid crystal compounds having a Sc phase and no helical structure are those having a nematic phase on the high temperature side of the Sc phase. Thus addition of a compound of the kind as mentioned above can lower the lower limit temperature of the Sc phase of the composition obtained. Besides the above mentioned advantages, where a chiral smectic liquid crystal compound having a very large spontaneous electric polarization is used as a component Many compounds in which Y is or in the formula I have a large spontaneous electric polarization, such as 80 to 100 nC cm². Thus addition of even a small amount of a ferroelectric liquid crystal compound of the kind as mentioned above can provide a composition having a sufficiently large spontaneous electric polarization. When a chiral smectic liquid crystal compound having not so large a spontaneous electric polarization is to he used as a component, it is necessary to increase the content thereof to some extent. In this case, it is effective for elongating helical pitch of the composition to mix a compound having a twist sense of helix right handed and a compound having a twist sense of helix left handed. In this type of compositions, minute adjustment of the helical pitch can be relatively easily made. As described above, according to the present invention, there can be obtained a chiral smectic liquid crystal composition having a region of Sc phase spreading in a wide temperature range from around room temperature, a large spontaneous electric polarization, and a long helical pitch. A liquid crystal display element capable of a very quick response can be obtained using the liquid crystal composition of this invention as a liquid crystal material. The present invention will be described further by way of examples but it is not offered by way of limitation. In addition values of spontaneous electric polarizations were measured by Sawyer Tower method and helical pitches were obtained by directly measuring with a polarizing microscope, the distance of stripped patterns corresponding to full pitch by using a homogeneously aligned cell.
