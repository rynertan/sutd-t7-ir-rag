## Description
FORMULATIONS OF SYNTHETIC, ORGANIC, OIL SOLUBLE INSECTICIDES HAVING INCREASED EFFECTIVENESS The present invention is directed to a method of increasing the effectiveness of synthetic, organic, oil soluble and water insoluble insecticides and to improved insecticidal compositions. In particular, the insecticidal activity of ultra low volume ULV insecticidal formulations and of low volume emulsion insecticidal formulations is increased. As an alternative approach to searching for new insecticidal agents, it is highly desirable to provide methods of improving the effectiveness of known insecticides. Improving the activity of known pesticides offers advantages of working with compounds having known physical, insecticidal, and toxicological characteristics. Improving the activity of insecticides results in lesser amounts needed to achieve desired effects, and, in turn, lesser amounts available to contaminate the environment. Insecticides are commonly applied to foliage asULV sprays, generally at rates of 0.9 to 18.7 liter hectare, or as more dilute emulsion sprays generally at rates of 18.7 to 935.4 liter hectare. Problems associated with spraying insecticides include loss of solvent, i.e., water, xylene, etc., by evaporation which greatly reduces the spray droplet size, causing loss of the active ingredients to spray drift uneven coverage of treated areas or uneven distribution on the plants and evaporation of the active insecticidal ingredients themselves, especially highly volatile insecticides.These are particularly annoying problems in certain insecticidal formulations where the sprays are delivered in relatively small droplets, having a diameter as small as about 50 microns, to facilitate spray distribution and penetration of the foliage canopy. The present invention provides a method of increasing the insecticidal effectiveness of insecticidal formulations. Additionally, the present invention provides a insecticidal formulations having lower volatilities when compared to known formulations resulting in an increased residual activity and b insecticidal formulations having increased deposition properties, both of these additional effects resulting in the use of lesser amounts of active insecticidal ingredients per hectare. The present invention relates to a method of increasing the effectiveness of insecticidal formulations by adding an effective amount of a polyoxyalkylene additive to insecticides or insecticidal formulations whereby the effectiveness of the insecticide is increased.Effective additives include a polyoxyalkylene polymer corresponding to the formula Y C3H6O n C2H40 rn CzH2z0 tH x Formula I wherein Y represents the residue, after reaction with an alkylene oxide, of an organic compound having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms x represents an integer greater than or equal to three 3 m represents a number greater than or equal to zero 0 with the proviso that C2H40 constitutes no more than 80 percent by weight of the alkylene oxide portion of the molecular t and n each independently represent a number greater than or equal to zero 0 with the proviso that the sum of t n is greater than or equal to eight 8 and z represents an integer greater than or equal to four 4 b polyoxyethyleneoxypropylene glycols, polyoxyethyleneoxybutylene glycols and polyoxyethyleneoxypropyleneoxybutylene glycols having less than 20 percent by weight of the molecule as ethylene oxide and having a molecular weight greater than 1,000 for the propylene oxide, the butylene oxide or propylene oxide butylene oxide portion of the molecule and c mixtures of a and b above. The present invention is also directed to insecticidal formulations containing the above polyoxyalkylene additives. Of particular interest in the practice of the present invention is a method of increasing the insecticidal effectiveness of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos methyl by combining with chlorpyrifos or chlorpyrifos methyl an amount of a polyoxyalkene additive which increases the effectiveness of the chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos methyl. When used herein, the terms insecticide , insecticidal , active, and the like, are meant to refer to synthetic, organic, oil soluble and waterinsoluble insecticides selected from the group consisting of organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids and formamidines, and biologically active compositions containing these insecticides which are effective in killing, preventing or controlling the growth of undesirable pests, i.e., insects. When used herein, the term insecticidal formulation refers to any composition containing an insecticide and a carrier system therefore, and includes concentrates, which are to be diluted before use, such as emulsifiable concentrates, and ready to use compositions, such as ULV formulations. Carrier systems include water, organic solvents, such as, xylene, benzene, methylene chloride, isophorone, dimethylformamide, paraffinic hydrocarbons and vegetable oils and other formulation ingredients, such as, surfactants, stabilizers, antioxidants and emulsifiers. When used herein, the term effective amount , when used to refer to the amount of polyoxyalkylene additive to be added to an insecticide, describes a quantity of additive which, when combined with an insecticide or an insecticidal formulation, increases the effectiveness of such insecticide. The amount of additive required to increase the effectiveness of insecticides will vary but generally is an amount at least about equal to the volume of insecticide present in the insecticidal formulation. It is preferable to add the present additives in amounts in the range of from 1 to 10 times the volumetric amount of insecticide present in the insecticidal formulation and even more preferable in the range of from 1 to 5. The present polyoxyalkylene additives are known compounds and some are commercially available.They are prepared employing procedures well known in the art. Commercially available polyoxyalkylene additives contemplated by the present invention include, for example, POLYGLYCOLR 15 200, POLYGLYCOLR 112 2, PLURONICX L 101, PtURONIC L 81, VORANOL commat , PLURACOL commat , PLURADOTE and TETRONICR polyols. Suitable compositions of Formula I above include those compositions wherein Y is the residue, after removal of the active hydrogen atoms, of a polyhydric alcohol, a sugar or an amine and specifically wherein Y is derived from glycerine, pentaerythritol, arabitol, xylitol, sorbitol, erythritol, trimethylolpropane or ethylenediamine. Preferred polyoxyalkylene polymers of Formula I above include those where Y is derived from glycerine, t is zero and the polyoxyethylene content is from 10 to 80 percent by weight of the molecule. The polyoxyalkylene polymers may be random or block copolymers. Either the polyoxypropylene or the polyoxyethylene may be the terminal group. When t, in Formula I above, is an integer greater than zero then z is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and z is usually an integer four 4 to 12. Preferred polyoxyalkylene additives include the commercially available POLYGLYCOLE 112 2 and POLYGLYCOLD 15 200 polyols and TETRONICE 702 polyether block polymer. The polyoxyethyleneoxypropylene glycols, polyoxyethyleneoxybutylene glycols and polyoxyethyleneoxypropyleneoxybutylene glycols, described above, are all well known compounds and are prepared employing techniques well known in the art. These glycols are commercially available as the PLURONICE series.Preferred glycols are PLURONICE L 101 and PLURONICE L 81 non ionic block co polymers. Insecticides, hereinbefore defined, which are acceptable in the practice of the present invention are those substantially water insoluble and oil soluble insecticides having a vapor pressure of at least 10 7 7 mmHg or higher at commonly encountered growing season or use temperatures, i.e., 15 40 C. Additionally, the insecticides are those which will not react with the present polyoxyalkylene additives. Classes of synthetic, organic, oil soluble insecticides employed in the practice of the present invention are the organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids and formamidines. Suitable insecticides include chlorpyrifos a preferred insecticide , sulprofos, methyl parathion, malathion, chlorpyrifosmethyl, dichlorvos, chlordimeform as the oil soluble base , permethrin, tetramethrin, decamethrin, cypermethrin, cyflualin fenvalerate and O,O dimethyl 0 5methyl 1 2 pyridyl lH 1,2,4 triazol 3 yl phosphorothioate. In the practice of the present invention, the above polyoxyalkylene additives are combined, in an effective amount, with insecticides whereby the effectiveness of the insecticides is increased. The insecticides are then applied to insects or their habitats for insect control. Preferably, the insecticides are applied to valuable plants, i.e., crops, ornamentals, pastures, turf, etc., for the control of undesirable pests. It is especially preferred to apply the present insecticidal formulations to crops. The polyoxyalkylene additives are mixed with insecticides alone, and thereafter applied using well known application techniques, or the additive insecticide combination is further admixed with known agricultural solvents and known agricultural formulating aids before application. The additives are also mixed with commercially available insecticidal formulations before use. While it is not critical to the practice of the present invention, the agricultural solvents are advantageously added to obtain a pesticidal formulation with a desirable viscosity to aid in the sprayability of the insecticidal formulations. Usually the polyoxyalkylene additive is a liquid at ambient room temperature but if the additive is a paste or solid then solvents are employed to obtain a formulation with desirable viscosity characteristics compatible for spray formulations.The optimum viscosity for an insecticidal formulation is readily determinable by one skilled in the art and depends on a variety of factors such as, for example, the particular insecticide s employed in the formulation, the polyoxyalkylene additive present in the formulation, the solvents present in the formulation, the type of equipment being employed in applying the formulation, and the mode of application, ì.e., ULV, emulsion or solution by aerial or ground application. Suitable agricultural solvents are generally water, petroleum solvents, esters, ketones, alcohols, lactones, etc. and include xylene, xylene range aromatic solvents, methylene chloride, l,l,l trichloroethane or combinations of solvents. Other agricultural formulating aids, such as, antioxidants, emulsifiers or surfactants, are also admixed with the insecticidal formulations of the present invention. For example, emulsifiable concentrates, i.e., formulations that are to be mixed with water and applied as an emulsion, normally contain emulsifiers, such as, the following commercially available products ATLOXE 3403 F, 3404 F, 3409 F brand emulsifiers, SPONTOD 140T, SPONTOD 300T, TRITONEX 35 and TRITONE X 45. Emulsifiers are used in the present insecticidal formulations that are emulsifiable concentrates to ensure uniform distribution of the concentrates in water at the time of application. The emulsifiers are added in effective quantities and proportions which are readily determinable to one skilled in the art.Similarly, antioxidants, such as 2,6 di tert butyl para cresol BHT and phenothiazine, or other stabilizers are added in effective quantities and proportions which are readily determinable to one skilled in the art. Insecticides are commercially available generally as formulations containing agricultural carriers, solvents and adjuvants. As a practical matter these commercially available formulations are admixed with the hereinbefore defined polyoxyalkylene additives to provide improved insecticidal formulations according to the present invention. For example, chlorpyrifos is commercially available as LORSBANE 4E insecticide and, when combined with POLYGLYCOLD 112 2 polyol in equal volumetric amounts provides a solution containing about 3 parts by volume additive to 1 part by volume chlorpyrifos active ingredient whereby the insecticidal formulation has an increased effectiveness.Alternatively, insecticides are obtained in substantially pure chemical form, i.e., bulk, technical grade, etc., and formulated by admixing with the present polyoxyalkylene additives and known agricultural solvents and adjuvants. When applying the present insecticidal formulations to crops, the combination of polyoxyalkylene additive and insecticide should be substantially free of any detrimental, i.e., phytotoxic, effects on the crops. The choice of an acceptable additive as far as phytotoxicity to target crops is concerned is readily determinable by one skilled in the art by employing standard biological phytotoxicity screening tests. In one embodiment of the present invention, a synthetic organic, oil soluble insecticide, useful in controlling pests in a valuable crop, is mixed with a polyoxyalkylene additive, hereinbefore described, wherein the polyoxyalkylene additive is present in an amount that is at least about equal to the volumetric amount of the insecticide. The insecticidal formulation is then applied, neat, as a foliar spray to the crop by aircraft or by ground equipment. Alternatively, an emulsifier is added to the formulation and then the formulation is mixed with water and applied to the crop as an emulsion by employing aircraft or ground equipment.When applying the present formulations as oil in water emulsions, they are generally applied as low volume sprays at a rate of 93.54 liters of spray per hectare or less. At greater spray volumes the increased effectiveness of the herein described insecticides is less dramatic. Also, the formulation is mixed with oil and applied employing known techniques. In another embodiment of the present invention, the herein described polyoxyalkylene additives, in combination with an emulsifying agent, are provided as emulsifiable tank mix additives which are to be separately added to the water carrier in the field tanks prior to application of the insecticidal formulations to crops. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a synthetic, organic, oil soluble insecticide, useful in controlling pests in valuable crops, is mixed with a polyoxyalkylene polymer of Formula I which is a block copolymer wherein Y is derived from glycerine x 3 t 0 and the polymer has an average molecular weight of about 4,700 and a ratio of polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene of about 4 1 respectively wherein the polyoxyethylene is the terminal group, commercially available as POLYGLYCOLE 112 2 polyol, or a polyoxyalkylene polymer of Formula I which is a random polymer wherein Y is derived from glycerine x 3 t 0 and the polymer has an average molecular weight of about 2,600 and equal proportions of polyoxypropylene and polyoxyethylene, commercially available as POLYGLYCOLS 15 200 polyol, wherein the polyol is present in an amount that is at least about equal to the volumetric amount of insecticide. The pesticidal formulation is then applied, neat, as an ULV foliar spray to the crop by aircraft or by ground equipment. Alternatively, an emulsifier is added to the formulation and then the formulation is mixed with water and applied to the crop as an emulsion at rates usually less than 93.54 liters spray per hectare, by employing aircraft or ground equipment. In an especially preferred embodiment of the present invention POLYGLYCOLD 112 2 polyol is combined with chlorpyrifos wherein the polyol is present in a volumetric amount at least about equal to the volume of chlorpyrifos. This formulation is then sprayed on a cotton crop by aircraft or ground equipment to provide up to 1.12 kg of chlorpyrifos per hectare of cotton crop. This formulation may be sprayed as an ULV Spray, optionally containing a solvent such as, methylene chloride, or as an oil in water emulsion by adding an emulsifying agent to the formulation and then adding it to water. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, PLURONICE L 101 or L 81 block copolymer is combined with chlorpyrifos wherein the block copolymer is present in an amount at least about equal to the volume of chlorpyrifos. This formulation is then sprayed on valuable crops by aircraft or ground equipment to provide up to 1.12 kg of chlorpyrifos per hectare of crop. This formulation may be sprayed as anULV spray, optionally containing a solvent such as, methylene chloride, or as an oil in water emulsion by adding an emulsifying agent to the formulation and then adding it to water. In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, a polyoxyalkylene polymer of FormulaI which is a block copolymer wherein Y is derived from ethylenediamine x 4 t 0 and the polymer has an average molecular weight of about 4,000 and a ratio of polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene of about 4 1 respectively wherein the polyoxyethylene is the terminal group, commercially available as TETRONICE 702 polyether block polymer, is combined with chlorpyrifos wherein the block copolymer is present in an amount at least about equal to the volume of chlorpyrifos. This formulation is then sprayed on valuable crops by aircraft or ground equipment to provide up to 1.12 kg of chlorpyrifos per hectare of crop.This formulation may be sprayed as an ULV spray, optionally containing a solvent such as methylene chloride, or as an oil in water emulsion by adding an emulsifying agent to the formulation and then adding it to water.
