# Process for preparing aggregated flaked coffee.

## Abstract
Aggregated coffee flake particles comprise a plurality of compressed coffee flakes bonded together wherein at least one of which is a low moisture flake 1 to 3.5 by weight and at least one of which is a high moisture flake 4.5 to 7 by weight are disclosed. The composite flake particles range in thickness from 9 to 16 mills. The flaked coffees provide improved extractability of the water soluble flavor constituents, exhibit high initial aroma levels, and exhibit high bed permeability. Also disclosed is a process for preparing aggregated mixed moisture flaked coffee. The process comprises 1 separately cold grinding dual streams of roast coffee, relatively high moisture and low moisture, respec tively 2 combining of the two ground coffee streams to provide a roll mill feed having a specified particle size distribution and average moisture content, and 3 passing the coffee feed through a roll mill under specific conditions, and 4 screening the roll milled, aggregated flaked coffee to produce a product such that no more than 60 by weight passes through a 30 mesh U.S. Standard screen.
