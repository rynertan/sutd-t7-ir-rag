# Mixed ion exchange resin bed and method of separating cationic from anionic beads.

## Abstract
In a mixed resin ion exchange resin bed a ferromagnetic material is incorporated with each of the ionic beads of one component of the bed containing more than one ionic bead component, such that the one ionic bead component can be separated from the other component by application of a magnetic field. In one embodiment, a ferromagnetic material having a specific Curie temperature is incorporated with one ionic bead component while the other bead component contains a different ferromagnetic material having a different Curie temperature.
