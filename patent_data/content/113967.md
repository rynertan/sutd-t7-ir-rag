# HEAT PRESSURE EXPANSION PROCESS FOR DRYING PURE SUGARS OR STARCH HYDROLYSATES TO PREPARE A FREE FLOWING POWDER

## Abstract
A process for producing a free flowing powdered solid form of a low softening point hygroscopic substance such as a pure sugar or starch hydrolysate comprises heating a concentrated aqueous solution of the substance to a tem perature above its normal boiling point under positive pressure and spraying the solution into a zone, held at a lower temperature and pressure than the solution, through which flows a stream of air or other inert gas.
