# Amusement apparatus.

## Abstract
The basic idea is that a device for playing games should be controlled by players without physical contact with the device, to allow a greater flexibility in the control and use of the device. To this end, each player is provided with a terminal unit 22 which is unconnected to the main device 21 except by means of waves transmitted through the atmosphere, e.g. radio, sound or light waves. The player can operate the unit 22 so as to control some function which eventually leads to the result of the game being recorded, for example on a display 23 on the terminal unit. The terminal unit may transmit signals to the device 21 to allow the player to control the start and or the playing of the game, but a form of apparatus is described in which the player is able to participate actively in a game using a terminal unit which receives signals sent out by the main device and does not need to be equipped with a transmitter.
