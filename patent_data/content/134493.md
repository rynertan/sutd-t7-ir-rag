# SEALING FIBER REINFORCED PLASTICS

## Abstract
High solids thermosetting organic solvent solution coat ing compositions are disclosed which are particularly useful for sealing the pores in fiber reinforced plastics. These compositions contain a mixture of resins comprising 1 from 30 to 70 of one or more hydroxy functional resins having a number average molecular weight of at least about 700, a Gardner bubble viscosity less than about Z₄ measured in methyl ethyl ketone at 90 solids at 25 C., and at least 5 of the hydroxy groups thereof being primary hydroxy groups, 2 from 10 to 70 of low molecular weight epoxy ester made by esterifying one or more resinous polyepoxides having a 1,2 epoxy equivalency of at least 1.2 with an approximately stoichiometric proportion of monocarboxylic fatty acid to provide an essentially epoxy free ester having a Gardner bubble viscosity less than Z₄ at 75 solids in xylol at 25 C., and 3 the balance of the mixture, but not less than 15 thereof, being a curing agent having a plurality of groups reactive with the hydroxy groups in the hydroxy resin and in the epoxy ester.
