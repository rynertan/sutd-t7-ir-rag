# EPOXY RESINS AND EMULSIONS MADE THEREFROM

## Abstract
Tertiary nitrogen containing chain extended epoxy re sins, capable of forming stable aqueous emulsions, may be produced by chain extending an epoxy resin using a tertiary nitrogen containing ether or ester polyol for example, particularly, polycaprolactone which has been polymerisa tion initiated by a tertiary amine polyol such as N methyl diethanolamine. The corresponding amine salt is formed by treatment with an acid for example acetic acid and the resulting cationic polymer may be dispersed in water to form a cationic emulsion capable of being coated onto a substrate by electrodeposition. The chain extended resins, by virtue of their content of free epoxy groups are also usable for cross linking and other uses.
