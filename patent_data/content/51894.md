# Imaging apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus is described for scanning a scene in bands of lines and reconstructing the scene in visible light. Use is made of a prism 1 in which the mirrors 3 make a sequence of various tilt angles with the axis of rotation 2. According to the invention all but one of the mirrors are used for scanning and reconstruction. To achieve this the angular spacing between the scanning and re construction locations S‚ÇÅ, R around the prism is an integral multiple of the angular spacing between ad jacent mirrors, which multiple is not a sub multiple of the total number of mirrors. For all but one of the mir rors, the tilt angle of a mirror at a scanning location differs from the tilt angle of the mirror simultaneously present at a reconstruction location by the same amount and in the same direction.
