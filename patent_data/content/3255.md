## Description
INTERNAL COMBUSTION ELASTIC FLUID GENERATOR BR TURBINE IVIOTOR COliBINATION This invention relates to apparatus and method for the generation of elastic fluids. It further relates to novel turbine engine combinations employing such apparatus. The prior art practise in relation to the generation of elastic fluids such as may be used in conjunction with steam turbines, tor example, appears to be limited to the use of external combustion methods, when using combustible fuels as a source of energy. In order to operate external combustion elastic fluid generators at reasonable thermal efficiencies it is necessary to provide relatively large heat exchange surfaces, and particularly where starting from cold or where there is an intermittent or varying demand, the time lag between demand and supply can be considerable. I have found that elastic fluids may be generated quickly and efficiently by an internal combustion method.In my method a mixture of combustible substances is mixed with a fluid, typically water, in a rotating chamber, and the mixture is combusted so as to raise the temperature in the chamber and generate steam in situ. My invention comprehends an apparatus for effecting the internal combustion whicn comprises a stator and a rotor mounted from the stator for rotary movement with respect thereto. The rotor is provided with means which, together with the peripheral surface of the stator contiguous with the rotor, define a plurality of chambers distributed around the rotor. Inlet means is provided for permitting the supply of a fluid combustible mixture into the chambers, and also the supply of a suitable noncombustible fluid thereto, typically water. Outlet means is further provided for releasing the mixture of combusted products and vaporized non combustible fluid subsequent to the combustion. Additionally ignition means is provided for igniting the combustible fluid mixture, the ignition means being located intermediate the inlet and outlet means. Generally the stator will be a housing for the rotor, with the rotor concentrically mounted within the stator.Preferably the chambers are formed as grooves in the peripheral surface of a cylindrical rotor. In a preferred embodiment, groups of chambers are separated by axially aligned wiper bars let into the surface of the rotor, the bars sealing upon the inner surface of the stator so as to reduce leakage of elastic fluid from the chambers in the combustion area. My invention also comprehends the combination of the combustor with a turbine, where the outlet of the combustor is directly connected to the inlet of the turbine, for example. The combination is particularly suited to relatively small units wherein the turbine may be a single stage impulse turbine for example. In such embodiment the housing of the turbine and the combustor may be in greater part unipartitely formed, and thereby provide a unit with desirable power to weir t ratio. Hydrogen and oxygen are particularly preferred in forming the combustible fluid mixture where the noncombustible fluid is water, as they will combust to form water the effluent from the turbine, where this is used in conjunction with my combustor, may be recycled into the combustor without any undesirable formation of acidic products. In principle any fluid fuel may be employed together with oxygen per se or a source thereof, such as air, for example. Thus hydrocarbons, particularly gases such as lpg. or liquid fractions such as gasoline will generally be suitable. It is also contemplated that chemical systems other than those depending upon an oxidative combustion may provide a suitable heat source for the generation of elastic.fluids. As a non combustible fluid for use in my combustion water will predominately be preferred, although other inert or relatively inert materials may under certain circumstances be preferred. The water may be water per se, or water in the form of steam or mixtures thereof. Thus, depending upon the relative concentrations of combustible and non combustible fluids admitted into the chambers of my combustor, and their heat contents, my combustor may be used as a superheater or a wet steam generator as desired. These aspects of my invention, together with further aspects and advantages such as may be explained or may be apparent to persons skilled in the art, will be more clear from a consideration of a preferred embodiment of my invention which is shown in the accompanying illustrations.In these illustrations Figure 1 is a plan view of my combustor in combination with a turbine Figure 2 is a view along section line 2 2 of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a plan view of the rotor of the turbine in Figure 1 Figure 4 is a side elevation of the rotor of Figure 3 Figure 5 is a plan view of the rotor of the combustor of Figure 1 Figure 6 is a side elevation of the rotor of Figure 5 Figure 7 is an isometric view of an axial sealing bar forming part of the rotor of Figure 5 Figure 8 is an elevation of a lateral sealing ring forming part of the rotor of Figure 5. Referring to the figures in detail, my combustor is identified therein generally by the numeral 10 and a turbine in tandem therewith by the numeral 40. Combustor 10 comprises a stator housing 12 having a cylindric bore opening 14 therein. A cylindrical rotor 16 is mounted from housing 12 by journals 18 to be concentric with bore opening 14. A shaft 20 projects from one side of the rotor 16 to beyond the confines of housing 12. Rotor 36 is provided with a number of axially elongated grooves 22 in its peripheral surface, these grooves bring sealed at each end thereof by rings 24. Rotor 16 is a moderately close tolerance fit within bore 14, so as to form with the wall of the bore a plurality of discrete chambers 25.It appears to be preferable for sealing purposes that the trailing wall of each groove has a greater radial dimension than the leading wall thereof, although other groove profiles are not precluded and may under some circumstances be preferred. A plurality of passage openings 26, 27 and 28 are formed in the wall of housing 12 to form inlets to chambers 25, and a further opening 29 forms an outlet therefrom. plugAn igniter such as a glow plug cr spark projects through the wall of housing 12 into bore 14 intermediate passage opening 26 and outlet opening 29. Passage openings 26, 27 and 28 together form means for introducing water and a combustible fluid mixture into chambers 25. Whilst a single passage opening could be employed, it is preferred for general ease of control to introduce the water and the materials forming the fluid mixture separately into the chambers 25. It is preferred to introduce the water supply to rotor 16 in moderate proximity to outlet opening 29 to provide the maximum residence time for the water.As previously observed, the water may be in the form of water per se, or steam which may be wet or dry, depending upon whether it is desired to employ the combustor 10 primarily as a superheater or as a wet or dry steam generator, the ratio of combustible to non combustible components charged to chambers 25 being suitably selected for the desired purpose. In each instance the enthalpy of the non combustible fluid will be increased. Assuming rotor 16 to be rotating in an anticlockwise direction as shown in Figure 2 by the arrow, one operating cycle of combustor 10 may be considered to commence with the metering into a chamber 25 of a suitable quantity of water through passage 28. As the rotor 16 rotates, the chamber will be successively charged with metered quantities of materials to form a combustive mixture.Typically and preferably, hydrogen is admitted through passage 27, and oxygen and air through passage 26. Further rotation of rotor 16 them moves the charged chamber opposite igniter 30, where the combustible mixture is combusted so as to raise the temperature in chamber 25 and increase the enthalpy of the non combustible fluid. The combusted contents of chamber 24 are then discharged through outlet 29 as the chamber rotates to a position opposite the outlet. The angular relationship between the combustion zone opposite igniter 30 and outlet 29 will be selected according to the nature of the fluid fuel to be combusted, and particularly its flame speed in relation to the residence time in chamber 25 so as to ensure reasonably complete combustion prior to exhaust through outlet 29. It will be appreciated that in this preferred embodiment chambers 25 rotate with constant volume. L do not preclude arrangements such as where rotor 16 is eccentrically mounted and provided with sliding vanes so as to vary the chamber volume as the Rotor rotates, but these appear to be neither necessary nor desirable.The pressure within a chamber 25 may well be slightly negative at the beginning of an operating cycle where water per se is charged through inlet opening 28.However, the steady state operating temperature of rotor 16 may suitably be some 300 400 C, hence the water is quickly transformed, at least partially, into an elastic state, and a positive pressure generated in chamber 25. In the angular zone between the igniter 30 and outlet opening 29 pressures within chamber 25 may be some 50kg cmê or more.In order to reduce leakage of pressure between chambers 25,I provide rotor 16 with wiper bars 32 situated at intervals around the rotor. Thus elongated axial slots 34 are formed in rotor 16 between every three chambers, the wiper bars 32 being radially moveable in the slots. The wiper bars 32 may be spring loaded outwardly, although this is generally not necessary as centrifugal pressure normally ensures good contact between the bars and the wall of bore 14. The outlet 29 of combustor 10 is positioned so as to form the inlet of turbine 40. Turbine 40 is a single stage impulse Lype, and comprises a housing 42 haviny a bore 43 with a rotor 44 Journalled therein, with an output shart 50 pro3ecti beyound tne conrines or housing 42.The housing 12 oi cobustor 10 and housing 42 are formed in major part unipartitely with wall portions common to the combustor and the turbine so as to give a copac and relatively light weight unit with reduced thermal losses The housing may be tormed rrom three parts , as best seen in Figure 1 comprising a manor body portion 45 wherein the bores 14 and 43 are formed integrally with the lert hand bearing supports, and integral end cap and right hand bearing supports 46, 48 for the combustor and turbine respectively, these securing to the major body portion with machine screws 49. In the illustrated form or rotor 16 wherein the combustion chambers 25 have constant volume it is necessary to provide energy from an external source to rotate the rotor. For this purpose I couple the output shaft 50 to shaft 20 of rotor 16 using a chain 53 and sprockets 54,55. In general, the diameter of rotor 16 may be significantly less than that of rotor 44, ratios commonly being in the range of about 5 to 13. Sprockets 54,55 are chosen so as to rotate rotor 16 at approximately 15 to 20 of the linear peripheral speed of that of turbine rotor 44, although a wide range of latitude is possible, depending upon the desired operating characteristics of the combination. Housing 2 is provided with an exhaust opening 57 or pernittin the exhaust OL steam from turbine 40. rhe exhaust steam may be recycled to opening 28, where it is of suitable quailty, or of course it may be employed as a eed cor a second turbine stage should this be desired. Provision for the introduction of cooling water rs also made in housing 42 throuqh inlet opening 59. Whilst the embodiment of my invention wherein the turbine combination has been described has been limited to a simple, one stage impulse turbine, it will be apparent that the invention in its broadest sense is not limited thereto, and almost any engine driven by an elastic fluid may be used in conjunction with my combustor. The scope of my invention is not limited to illustrated embodiment thereof, but rather according to the spirit of the accompanying claims.
