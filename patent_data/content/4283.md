# Tool for applying connectors to flexible cable.

## Abstract
A portable manually operated tool for applying multi contact connectors to flexible flat cable includes a pair of pivoted jaws which include respective connector body and cover holding members. The jaws are opened and closed by manually actuated handles including a locking toggle mechanism. The connector holding members include co operating alignment guides and position stops. One of the connector holding members is mounted for limited movement on one of the jaws to provide for engagement of the alignment guides and to provide even distribution of the clamping force on the connector. The tool also includes a retractable cable cutter and positioning stop as well as a cable alignment and support tray.
