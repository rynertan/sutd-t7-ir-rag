# Method of and apparatus for winding coils.

## Abstract
In an apparatus for winding coils for a stator of a motor, a guide plate 27 with a plurality of guide steps 27a, 27b is disposed movably along a coil former member 1A and is lowered more quickly than the coil former member 1A so that one of the guide steps is located at the border between two adjacent steps of the coil former member 1A. The leading wire can be smoothly led by each guide step without decreasing a winding speed when a winding operation is transferred from a step of the coil former member to an upper step thereof.
