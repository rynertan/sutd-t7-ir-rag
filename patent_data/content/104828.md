# Colour video signal processing.

## Abstract
A filter adaptively filters a PAL or NTSC luminance signal so as to attenuate the high frequency portion of the luminance band, in which the chrominance information lies, when movement is detected. This reduces cross colour in the reproduced picture. Movement is detected by comparing 20 the undelayed luminance signal with this signal delayed 18 by an integral number of lines corresponding substan tially to one field or one picture. The resultant is applied to a ROM 22 which provides a multiplier coefficient to a multiplier 26 at the output of a high pass filter circuit 16 in the luminance channel. The filter may precede a coder or follow a decoder.
