## Description
This invention relates to oxidation catalysts which are useful in treating exhaust gases from various combustors by decomposing hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide contained in the exhaust gases for complete oxidation into carbon dioxide and water vapor and are also useful in treating relatively light liquid hydrocarbons, such as kerosene, gas oil and the like, and hydrocarbons, such as methane, propane and the like, by catalytic combustion with air. The invention also relates to a method for preparing the oxidation catalysts. It is known that the platinum group metals, such as platinum, palladium, rhodium and the like, have the highest activity when used as catalysts for completely oxidizing unburnt hydrocarbons in the presence of air into carbon dioxide and water vapor. However, the platinum group metal catalysts are expensive and not resistant to heat. Thus, when employed at high temperatures not lower than 600 Oxides of base metals such as cobalt, nickel, iron and the like serve as an oxidation catalyst, but are lower in oxidation activity than the platinum group metal catalysts and have a low heat resistance. Thus, these base metal oxides have not been in use as a complete oxidation catalyst. In order to overcome these disadvantages, extensive studies have been made on compound oxides having a perovskite structure because of the high activity for oxidation. These perovskite compound oxides are represented by the formula ABO₃, in which A represents a rare earth metal such as lanthanum, neodymium or the like, and B represents a transition metal such as cobalt, iron, nickel or the like. In addition, the compound oxides of the formula, A¹A²BO₃, in which part of A¹ is replaced by A² wherein A² represents cerium, strontium or the like, are known. The US PS 4.134.852 discloses perovskite type catalysts of the general formula ABO₃, which are used for the purification of automotive exhaust streams. In this formula A is an element such as alkali, alkaline earth or rare earth metals and B represents a transition metal or an element selected from the platinum group metals. A specific example of such catalyst is given as Sr Further it is known in the art, that rare earth elements are collected from ores which usually contain a mixture of various rare earth elements. However, it is very difficult to seperate these rare earth elements from one another, thus inviting high production costs. The proportion in cost of the rare earth elements in perovskite type catalysts is very high. It is an object of the invention to provide oxidation catalysts of perovskite type compound oxides which have high oxidation activity, are highly resistant to heat and which can be obtained much less expensively than known perovskite compound oxides. The object is achieved by an oxidation catalyst of a perovskite type compound oxide of the general formula A¹A²BO₃, in which A¹ represents a mixture of rare earth elements, A² represents at least one element which is selected from alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and rare earth elements and B represents at least one transition metal, A method for preparing an oxidation catalyst of the perovskite type according to the invention comprises The present invention will be better understood by reading the following description in detail. As it is known, the catalytic activity of perovskite compound oxides is chiefly dominated by the transition metal in the B site. The elements in the A¹ and or A² site are necessary only for maintaining the crystal structure of the compound oxide. Studies on the oxidation activity have been made in which a variety of rare earth elements in the A¹ site are used in different combinations to determine the activity. As a result, it has been found that a significant change in the oxidation activity does not take place although slight changes are observed. The perovskite type compound oxides prepared above were subjected to electron spectrometry for chemical analysis ESCA , with the results that the oxidation activity changed with a change in surface atomic ratio of a transition metal and rare earth elements. The term surface atomic ratio used herein is intended to mean an atomic ratio of a transition metal and the total rare earth elements to a depth of 10 ⁶ to 2.10 ⁶ mm 10 to 20 Å as determined by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis. Moreover, it was found that when lanthanum was used as an element in the A¹ site and part of the lanthanum was substituted with an element such as cerium, strontium or the like, which had a valence different from lanthanum, the activity was significantly improved when cerium was used in an amount of 10 atomic percent or strontium was used in an amount of 20 atomic percent. These samples were also subjected ESCA, revealing that the atomic ratio of cobalt and lanthanum on the surfaces was in a maximum and was almost stoichiometric at the highest activity. Based on the above findings, we could solve the problem of the high cost of perovskite type oxidation catalysts using a single rare earth element owing to the difficulty in separation of the element. As described before, the invention provides an oxidation catalyst of the perovskite type compound oxide of the general formula, A¹A²BO₃, in which A¹ is a mixture of rare earth elements collected from an ore, A² is at least one element selected from alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, rare earth elements other than those contained in the mixture, and B represents at least one transition metal. The at least one element should have a valence and an atomic ratio which are different from the mixed rare earth elements. In addition, in order to maintain the perovskite structure, the at least one element should have a tolerance factor, The at least one element, which is replaced by part of the rare earth elements in the A¹ site and whose valence and atomic radius are determined as defined above, may be alkali metals such as Na, K, Li and the like, alkaline earth metals such as Ca, Mg, Sr, and the like, and rare earth elements other than those contained in ores, such as Yb, Eu and the like. The metals or elements indicated above are all useful in the practice of the invention, of which Ce, Sr and Ca are preferred. The atomic ratio in bulk or starting composition of the at least one element is not critical and depends on the composition of the mixed rare earth elements. In other words, the atomic ratio of the bulk or starting composition is determined such that the surface atomic ratio of the transition metal and the mixed rare earth elements is within a range from 1.0 1.0 to 1.1 1.0 and preferably 1 1. The transition metal used in the B site may be cobalt, nickel, iron or mixtures thereof, of which Co is preferably used. For the preparation of the oxidation catalyst of the perovskite type compound oxides, ores containing a mixture of rare earth elements in the form of oxides, e.g. monazite, are provided, from which the mixture is collected by a suitable technique. The mixed oxides are dissolved in mineral acids, such as nitric acid, to which at least one element in the form of salts or an oxide and a transition metal oxide are added. The at least one element and transition metal oxide may be dissolved simultaneously with or after addition of the mixed oxides, or may be added in the form of solutions. The transition metal oxides are added in an amount sufficient to adjust the surface atomic ratio substantially to the stoichiometric ratio after calcination. More particularly, the transition metal oxide is added in an atomic ratio to the mixed rare earth elements of 0.9 1.0 to 1.1 1.0, calculated as the metal and elements, not as oxides. It will be noted, however, that the resulting compound oxide does not have a surface atomic ratio of approximately 1 1 unless the at least one element as A² site is used. This is because oxides of rare earth elements tend to appear on the surface of the compound oxide if the at least one element is not added. In other words, the at least one can suppress the oxides of rare earth elements from appearing on the compound surface, so that the surface atomic ratio of a transition metal and rare earth elements is controlled to be nearly stoichiometric. In order to make a high catalytic activity on the oxide surfaces, it is necessary to achieve substantially a stoichiometric ratio of the transition metal and the mixed rare earth elements in the final perovskite type oxide. If the mixed rare earth elements and transition metals are chemically combined without addition of the at least one element, the ratio of the transition metals and the mixed rare earth elements on the surfaces of the compound oxide may be far away from the stoichiometric ratio. Thus, the catalytic activity becomes poor. To avoid this, at least one element selected from alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and rare earth elements other than those contained in the mixed rare earth elements from ores, is used in place of part of the mixed rare earth elements. The at least one element is preferably added in the form of a solution. For this purpose, salts of the at least one element, which are soluble in water, are preferably used. Examples of the salts include nitrates, sulfates, acetates, hydrochlorides, carbonates and the like. Oxides may also be used. The at least one element is added in an amount of from 5 to 20 mole of the total moles of the mixed rare earth elements. The mixture is finally charged into an alkaline solution under agitation to permit precipitation. The alkaline solution may contain an oxidizing agent, such as hydrogen peroxide, and the oxidizing agent is preferably used because the resulting precipitate is obtained directly in the form of perovskite type oxides if used. Otherwise, hydroxides may be obtained, which will be converted into corresponding oxides by calcination or sintering. The alkalis used in the solution may be sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, aqueous ammonia and the like. The resulting precipitate is washed with water and calcined at 300 to 400 The ores used to make the perovskite type oxides may be any ores comprising a plurality of rare earth elements ordinarily in the form of oxides. A typical ore is monazite. The monazite has generally an oxide composition which comprises La₂O₃, Pr₆O₁₁, Nd₂O₃, Sm₂O₃, CeO₂ and the like. The contents of these oxides vary depending on the place of origin and may predominantly contain La₂O₃, Pr₆O₁₁ and Nd₂O₃. These rare earth elements have tri or higher valences. The transition metals may be iron, cobalt, nickel or mixtures thereof as mentioned before. On mixing with the mixed rare earth element, the transition metal is preferably added to the elements at an atomic ratio of 0.9 1 to 1.1 1. As a result, the surface atomic ratio in the final perovskite type oxide product comes near to a stoichiometric ratio of 1 1. When the transition metals are used as a mixture of two metals, one metal should be less than 30 wt of the mixture. For instance, if cobalt is used as a main metal in the B site, iron or nickel should be used in an amount less than 30 wt . The perovskite type oxide catalyst may be used as it is, or after deposition of carriers in various forms. The oxide catalyst using mixed rare earth elements has a high catalytic activity and a high resistance to heat as will be understood from the following examples. A mixture of oxides of rare earth elements available under the designation of Lex 70 from Santoku Metals Ind. Co., Ltd. was provided as A¹ site elements. The mixture had a composition of 99.6 wt of rare earth element oxides, 0.005 wt of CaO and 0.2 wt of Ig loss. The oxide composition was comprised of 55.34 wt of La₂O₃, 11.63 wt of Pr₆O₁₁, 32.64 wt of Nd₂O₃, 0.37 wt of Sm₂O₃, and below 0.03 wt of CeO₂. Fifty grams of the mixture was dissolved in nitric acid, to which cerium nitrate was added in an amount of 11 , calculated as cerium element, of the total number of moles of the oxide mixture, which was determined from the composition of the oxide mixture. Cobalt oxide was separately dissolved in nitric acid in an amount equal to the average number of moles of the mixed rare earth elements. This solution was added to the first mixture. The mixed solution was added to an excess of a caustic soda solution along with a hydrogen peroxide solution, followed by agitation to form a precipitate. The precipitate was well washed with distilled water and calcined at 400 The powder was charged into a 5 colloidal alumina aqueous dispersion to obtain a slurry and was applied onto a cordierite honeycomb having 1 cell mm² 64 cells inch² in an amount of 8 wt . This catalyst was used to determine an oxidation activity of CO at a space velocity of 18000 hr ¹. The conversion of CO at a reaction temperature of 100 Fifty grams of mixed rare earth elements Lex 70 was dissolved in nitric acid, to which strontium nitrate was added in an amount of 20 mole of an average composition of the mixed rare earth element. To the solution was added cobalt oxide dissolved in nitric acid and used in an equimolar amount corresponding to the average number of moles of the total rare earth elements. The mixed solution was charged into an excess of a caustic soda solution along with a hydrogen peroxide solution under agitation to form a precipitate. The precipitate was well washed with distilled water and calcined at 400 Similar to Examples 1 and 2, 50 g of Lex 70 was dissolved in nitric acid, to which thorium nitrate was added in an amount of 5.8 by mole, which was determined from an average composition of the mixed rare earth element. Cobalt oxide was separately dissolved in nitric acid in an equimolar amount to an average number of moles of the total rare earth elements. This solution was added to the first solution. The mixed solution was charged into an excess of a caustic soda solution along with a hydrogen peroxide solution and agitated to form a precipitate. The precipitate was well washed with distilled water and calcined at 400 Similar to Example 1, 50 g of Lex 70 was dissolved in nitric acid, to which strontium nitrate was added in an amount corresponding to 20 , as strontium atom, of the number of moles determined from an average composition of Lex 70. Cobalt oxide was separately dissolved in nitric acid in such an amount that the number of moles of cobalt atoms was higher by 2 mole than the total number of moles of the rare earth elements. This solution was added to the first solution. The mixed solution ws charged into an excess of a caustic soda solution along with a hydrogen peroxide solution and agitated to form a precipitate. The precipitate was well washed with distilled water and calcined at 400 Similar to Example 1, 50 g of Lex 70 was dissolved in nitric acid, to which cerium nitrate was added in an amount corresponding to 10 , as cerium atom, of the number of moles determined from an average composition of Lex 70. Cobalt oxide was separately dissolved in nitric acid in an amount equal, calculated as cobalt atom, to the total number of moles of the mixed rare earth elements. This solution was added to the first solution. Moreover, ferric nitrate was also dissolved in nitric acid in an amount of 5 based on the total number of moles of the mixed rare earth elements and added to the above solution. The mixed solution was charged into an excess of a caustic soda solution along with a hydrogen peroxide solution and agitated to form a precipitate. The precipitate was well washed with distilled water and calcined at 400 As will be appreciated from the above examples, high oxidation activities are attained in spite of the fact that the mixed rare earth elements which are not uniform in composition are used. The product cost is 1.5 to 2 times less than the cost using a single rare earth element. The perovskite type compound oxides of the invention have a good resistance to heat when determined at a temperature of 900
