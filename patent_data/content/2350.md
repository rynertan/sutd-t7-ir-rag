# A composition suitable for forming a neutralised sulfonated thermoplastic fibre, a process for forming such a fibre and the formed fibre.

## Abstract
A neutralised sulfonated thermoplastic polymer when dissolved in a solvent system, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, so as to form a solution having a Brookfield viscosity at ambient temperature of 1,000 to 200,000 cps. results in a solution suitable for forming fibres. The solution is passed through a spinneret having a plurality of orifices.
