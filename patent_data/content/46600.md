# Heat exchanger for a gaseous and a liquid medium.

## Abstract
A heat exchanger for a gaseous and a liquid medium comprising one or more blocks 26 34 , each being built up from a plurality of pipe screens arranged side by side and formed each by a row of closely adjacent, pipes communicat ing at the bottom and at the top with a collector 3 , the outermost screens 5, 6 being constructed in the form of diaphragm walls with the aid of strips located between the pipes, peripheral screens 8, 9 being arranged at the edges of the pipe screens 1 and also constructed in the form of diaphragm walls, each being formed by a row of vertical pipes adjoining intermediate collectors 13 , each diaphragm wall being connected at the vertical edges in sealing relationship with the adjacent diaphragm wall orthogonal thereto, whilst the collectors and the intermediate collectors are connected by connecting pipes 17 with main collectors 16 .
