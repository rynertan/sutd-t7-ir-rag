## Description
IMPROVED PROCESS FOR SYNTHESIS OF HINDERED AMINE STABILIZERS FOR POLYMERIC MATERIALS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention relates to a process. More specifically, this invention is directed to the synthesis of hindered amines by phase transfer catalyzed condensation of a primary or secondary amine with an a halo acetamide. Description of the Prior Art The increasing use of polymers in the place of the more traditional types of structural materials, e. g. wood, metals, etc. has necessitated the compounding of such polymers with a variety of stabilizers in order to enhance their ability to withstand prolonged exposure to a variety of degradative forces.Degradation of such environmentally sensitive polymers can be caused by exposure to light, heat and or air. Such degradation is usually manifest by either a partial or total loss of structural integrity, changes in light transmission properties, changes in color, loss or reduction in flexibility and or resiliency, or any combination of the above phenomenon. As will be appreciated, the stabilizers which are used in conjunction with the above polymeric materials, in addition to providing protection against such degradative forces, must also be compatible with the aesthetic properties of the polymeric article formed from such materials and be effective at low concentrations. The economics of the marketplace dictate that these stabilizers be relatively inexpensive and capable of preparation from readily available starting materials by simple and straightforward synthesis techniques. The prior art is replete with both patents and technical articles describing various stabilizers suitable for use in structural engineering plastics and in various synthetic fibers. The hindered amine stabilizers are prominently mentioned as suitable in the stabilization of such materials against ultraviolet light degradation. Illustrative of these hindered amines are the decahydroquinolines disclosed in U. S.Patents 3,919,234 3,920,659 3,928,330 4,069,195 and 4,073,770 the 1,5 diazacycloalkan 2 ones disclosed inU. S. Patent 4,207,228 and, the l,4 diazacycloalkan 2ones disclosed in U. S. Patents 4,167,512 and 4,240,961.These hindered amine stabilizers can be prepared in various ways and from various materials. The preparation of the U.V. stabilizers disclosed in U. S. Patents 4,240,961 and 4,190,571 is reportedly achieved by phase transfer catalyzed reaction of certain appropriate starting materials. Phase transfer catalysis initiated synthesis is also reportedly effective in the synthesis of other types of stabilizer namely, the synthesis of antioxidants and compounds which enhance a polymer s resistance to thermal degradation. The first disclosure relating to the phase transfer catalyzed synthesis of this latter class of stabilizers is by Dr. J. T. Lai in a paper presented before the A.C.S.National Meeting on March 19, 1978 in Houston, Texas entitled, Synthesis of a Aminoamides from Phase TransferCatalyzed Reactions . The subject matter of Dr. Lai s paper is also described in copending patent application 916,639 filed June 19, 1978. The title compounds of Dr. Lai s paper are prepared by reaction of aniline, and its para substituted derivatives, with chloroform, acetone and sodium hydroxide in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst. Dr. Lai s synthesis proceeds by reaction of the chloroform with base thereby generating a trichloromethide ion which can subsequently combine with the ketone or aldehyde forming an oxirane intermediate. This intermediate combines with the aniline, or its para substituted derivatives, and optionally, with another primary or secondary amine yielding the desired reaction product. Where the foregoing synthesis is carried out with aniline, or para substituted aniline, only one product will result and such product will be symmetrical. In the event that a primary or secondary amine is also present, in addition to aniline, or a para substituted aniline, the reaction can still be directive for a single product, depending upon the concentration of the primary or secondary amine, a stoichiometric excess being required , relative to the aniline, or para substituted aniline. The product obtained in this latter situation will be asymmetrical in the sense that one end of the resultant compound will be substituted by the aniline and the other end by the primary or secondary amine. In both of the above synthesis, that is the synthesis of symmertrical or asymmetrical compounds in which aniline, or parasubstituted aniline, is a reactant, only one reaction product will result.In the event the foregoing synthesis is repeated without aniline, or a para substituted aniline, being present, the primary or secondary amine in the charge will react with the oxirane intermediate randomly i.e., random attachment at both of the potentially reactive sites yielding a mixture containing four products. It is, thus, readily apparent, that if one desires to use phase transfer catalyzed synthesis of compounds such as described by Lai, aniline, or para substituted aniline, would appear to be a required reactant to avoid the formation of product mixtures, which are both difficult to separate and may contain compounds deficient in the desirable stabilizer activity . But for the limitations imposed by the choice of aniline, or para substituted aniline, as a reactant, the above synthesis would provide both an efficient and desirable process for preparation of useful stabilizer compounds. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is the object of this invention to remedy the above as well as related deficiencies in the prior art. More specifically, it is the principal object of this invention to provide a process which is directive for the synthesis of a substituted acetamides by phase transfer catalyzed reaction of a primary or secondary amine and an a halo acetamide. It is yet another object of this invention to provide a process which is directive for the synthesis of symmetrically substituted hindered amines by phase transfer catalyzed reaction of a primary or secondary amine and an a halo acetamide The above and related objects are achieved by providing a process for the synthesis of polysubstituted a amino acetamides of the formulaEMI4.1 wherein R1 and R4 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl of 1 8 carbon atoms, aryl, cycloalkyl, piperidinyl, hindered piperidinyl and alkalene of 2 6 carbon atoms R2 and R3 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl of 1 6 carbon atoms and R5 is hydrogen or alkyl of 1 6 carbon atoms and can, in conjunction with the acyclic substit uents of R1, form a heterocyclic group pendant from the a carbon by reaction, in the presence of a suitable phase transfer catalyst and alkali, of a primary or secondary amine with an a halo acetamide. The terms asymmetrical and symmetrical as employed herein in the characterization of the substituted acetamide refers to similarity or dissimilarity in the substituents pendent from and or which include the nitrogen atoms at the opposite ends of such compounds.These compounds are useful in the stabilization of photosensitive polymers against the degradative action of ultraviolet light. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION INCLUDING PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The a substituted acetamide described hereinabove can be prepared in accordance with the process of this invention by phase transfer catalyzed reaction, under suitable conditions and in suitable reaction medium, of a primary or secondary amine with an a halo acetamide. The primary and secondary amines suitable for use in this process can be represented by the following formula EMI5.1 wherein R1 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl of 1 8 carbon atoms, aryl, cycloalkyl, piperidinyl, partially or totally hindered piperi dinyl, and alkalene of 2 6 carbon atoms, and 5. R is hydrogen, alkyl of 1 6 carbon atoms and can, in conjunction with the acyclic substituents of R1, form a heterocyclic compound. Representative of the primary and secondary amines which are within the scope of the foregoing formula and suitable for use in the process of this invention include 10 amines, t butylamine, t octylamine, aniline, alkyl substituted aniline i.e. toluidine , isopropyl amine, propyl amine, 4 amino 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl piperidine, allyl amine and, 20 amines, morpholine, N methylaniline, diethyl amine. The a halo acetamides suitable for use in the process of this invention can be represented by the following formula EMI6.1 wherein R2 and R3 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and 4. alkyl of 1 6 carbon atoms R4 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl of 1 8 carbon atoms, aryl, cycloalkyl, piperidinyl, partially or totally hindered piperidinyl, and alkalene of 2 6 carbon atoms and X is chloride or bromide. Representative of the a halo acetamides which are within the scope of the foregoing formula and suitable for use in the process of this invention in dude a chloro a , a dimethyl N phenylacetamide, abromo a,a dimethy N phenylacetamide, a bromo a , a dimethyl acetamide, N,N 1,2 ethane bis a bromo a,a diethyl acetamide , and a,bromo a,a dimethyl N 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinyl acetamide. The overall synthesis involved in the process of this invention involves initially charging a reactor, under the conditions hereinafter set forthwith an appropriate amine, an a halo acetamide, base i.e., an alkali metal hydroxide and phase transfer catalyst, and thereafter heating the contents of the reactor for a predetermined interval. The synthesis proceeds generally as follows EMI7.1 Although the foregoing reaction appears straight forward, the various reactants initially combine with one another to form certain intermediate compounds, which in turn react with one another to form the desired product. It is in the formation of these intermediate compounds which distinguishes this process from that previously disclosed byDr. Lai in his A.C.S. presentation and in his copending application, Serial Number 916,639. Initially, the a halo acetamide, referred to hereinabove, reacts with the sodium hydroxide in the charge to produce an imino a lactone as follows EMI7.2 This intermediate species differs significantly from the oxirane intermediate of the process previously disclosed byLai in that the above imino a lactone has only one potentially reactive site for addition of the primary or secondary amine.Therefore, this imino a lactone and the primary and secondary amines, set forth hereinabove, can only react with one another as follows EMI8.1 As is apparent, the above series of reactions permits the formation of both symmetrical and asymmetrical compounds does not lead to the formation of product mixture since the imino a lactone is only reactive toward the primary and secondary amine at a single site, the tertiary carbon the reaction requires less base for the neutralization of the mineral acid formed incidental to the imino a lactone formation and the reaction is decidedly less exothermic thereby permitting greater freedom of process control.By way of comparison, it will be appreciated that since the reaction of the oxirane intermediate with aniline, and substituted aniline, proceeds spontaneously in the presence of base and phase transfer catalyst and, the reaction temperature must be carefully controlled the reaction temperature being preferably maintained between 0 to 100 C. In contrast to the above, the imino a lacetone intermediate, produced during the process of this invention, reacts only sluggishly with both the primary and secondary amine under ambient laboratory conditions and requires heating of the reactor charge, preferably to a temperature in the range of from about 40 to 1000 C, to drive the reaction, at an acceptable rate, in the direction of the desired product. In the process of this invention, the relative concentration of the reactants to one another, and process conditions of this synthesis should be adequate to insure both a satisfactory rate of reaction and acceptable product yield. In general, the relative molar concentration of primary or secondary amine to a halo acetamide can range from about 1 1 to about 100 1. In the preferred embodiments of this invention, a stoichiometric excess of primary or secondary amine is required to drive the reaction in the direction of the desired product. The concentration of NaOH present as a 50 aqueous solution, or in solid form is generally not critical so long as sufficient base is present to transform the a halo acetamide to the corresponding imino a lactone and neutralize the mineral acid generated during the intermediate phase of the reaction.Good results have been obtained where the molar concentration of NaOH, based upon a 50 aqueous solution , relative to a haloacetamide in the original charge, is in the range of from about 1 5. This relationship, of course, is somewhat misleading since the NaOH solution is preferably added incrementally to the reactor after all the reactants, including phase transfer catalyst, have been charged to the reactor. The phase transfer catalysts which are suitable for use in the process of this invention, include those materials that can generally be described as onion salts of sulfur, or of any element of Group VA of the Periodic Table and which satisfy the following formula RnY X wherein Y is selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, phosphorous and sulfur R can be one or more monovalent organic radicals bonded to Y by covalent linkage X is a counterion and n is an integer from 3 to 4 with the proviso, that when Y is pentavalent, that is nitrogen and phosphorous, then n 4, and when Y is tetravalent, that is sulfur, then n 3. In an analogous manner, onium salts having certain multivalent organic substituents may be useful in this invention. Examples include multivalent organic radicals that include Y in a ring, and those that are bonded to more than one x. More preferred onium salts for use in this invention have the formula RaRbRcRdY X wherein Y is N or P, and Ra Rd are monovalent hydrocarbon radicals preferably selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl, and cycloalkyl moieties or radicals, optionally substituted with suitable heteroatom containing functional groups. The total number of carbon atoms in Ra, R, Rc, and Rd, if the salt is quaternary, should be at least 10 and is preferably in the range from about 15 to 40. No theoretical maximum number of carbon atoms for inclusion in the onium salts exists, although in general, about 70 carbon atoms represents the upper limit imposed by practical limitations. Since the liquid phases involved are both aqueous and organic, the number of the carbon atoms and structure of the onium salts are usually selected to impart to the salt a marked solubility in the organic phase. The onium salt itself is nonreactive with respect to all materials in the reaction mixture except the reactants themselves. Most preferred onium salts are those in which Y is nitrogen and hydrocarbon radicals where Ra is C2H5, and Rb,RC and Rd are each selected from the group consisting of C H n C5H11 mixed C5Hll n C6H13 mixed C6H13 C6H5 C H CH n C8H17 n C12H25 n C18H37 mixed C8 C10 alkyl R1 and the like. However, R1 may also be selected from C2H5, n C3H7 and n C4H9. Various counterions may be used, including Cl Br , I , F , SO4 , HSO4 and the like. Most preferred is Cl The concentration of the onium salts, of the foregoing structure, which are present in the charge need only be sufficient to effectively catalyze the reaction of the amine and the a halo acetamide. In practice, the quantity of catalyst employed is in the range from about 0.01 mol to about 10 mols, and more preferably, for the usual practice of this invention, from about 1 to about 20 mpha mols per 100 mols of primary or secondary amine used. The amount of salt used is not critical, the optimum amount in each case being easily determined by simple trial and error. An amount greater than about 20 mpha is uneconomical and serves no useful purpose. Typically, the foregoing reactants and catalyst are added to a reactor, such as a round bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser, the reactor purged of air with an inert gas, and aqueous NaOH added incrementally while the exotherm of the reaction is initially controlled by immersion of the base of the flask in an ice bath. The reactor is also preferably equipped with a magnetic stirrer.The conditions prevailing during such process can be readily controlled and generally the reaction proceeds at atmospheric pressure. The reaction can proceed satisfactorily at temperatures in the range of from about 200C to about 1000C, and most preferably from 400C to 1000C. Often times one or more of the reactants themselves i.e., the primary or secondary amine can serve as the medium for the conduct of the synthesis of this invention. Alternatively, such synthesis can also be satisfactorily conducted in an organic solvent provided, such solvent is inert toward both the reactants and product of the synthesis under the anticipated reaction conditions.Typical organic solvents which can be used in this process include the common aromatic and paraffinic solvents such as benzene, p xylene, toluene, dichloromethane, chlorobenzene, cyclohexane and the like. Once the desired compound has been prepared from the aforementioned materials in accordance with the above process, it can be readily recovered from the reaction medium by conventional means. The compounds prepared as described above are highly effective in the stabilization of photodegradable polymeric material from the deteriorating effects of ultraviolet light. The term sphotodegradation as used herein is intended as descriptive of any photo induced changes in the physical, chemical and or electrical properties of such organic polymeric materials upon their exposure to sufficient quanities of ultra violet light. Such degradation can typically include cross linking of the polymer, dehydrohalogenation, reduction in chain length, photooxidation and the like.Polymers which are especially sensitive to ultraviolet light degradation are materials which contain unsaturation along their respective backbones, such as cispolyisoprene, styrene butadiene copolymer, vinyl halide polymers, polyolefins, polyacetaldehydes, polyurethanes, ABS resins, polystyrene, polyacrylonitrile, polycarbonates, polyacrylates, poly a alkyl acrylates, varnish, phenolformaldehyde resins, polyepoxides, polyesters, and their respective blends and copolymers. The compounds prepared according to the process of this invention are especially effective in the stabilization of the poly a monoolefins such as pol ymers derived from ethylene, propylene, isobutylene, l butene, l pentene, l hexene, 4 methyl l pentene and the like. In addition to the stabilizers prepared according to the process of this invention, a typical structural engineering plastic can contain common compounding ingredients and additional stabilizers for the protection of such plastic against various other degradative forces and agents. Representative compounding ingredients can include metal oxides, such as zinc, calcium and magnesium oxide, fatty acids such as stearic, lauric acid and the metal salts thereof fillers such as calcium and magnesium carbonate, calcium and barium sulfonates, aluminum silicates, asbestos, and the like plasticizers and extenders, such as dialkyl and diaryl organic acids, such as diisobutyl, diisooctyl, diisodecyl and dibenzyl oleates, stearates, sebacates, azelates, phthalates, and the like ASTM Type 2 petroleum oils, paraffinic oils, castor oil, tall oil, glycerine, and the like antioxidants, such as 2,6 di tbutyl phenol , 2,2 thio bis 4 methyl 6 t butyl phenol , 2,2 methylene bis 6 t butyl 4 ethyl phenol, 4,4 butyldiene bis 6 t butyl m cresol, 2 4 hydroxy 3,5 di t butylani lino 4,6 bis octylthio 1,3,5 triazine, hexahydro 1,3,5 tris f3 3, 5 di t butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl isocyanurate, tetrakismethylene 3 3 ,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate methane, distearylthiodipropionate, dilaurylthiodipropionate, tri nonylphenyl phosphite, tin thioglycolate, and the like and other ingredients such as pigments, tackifiers, flame retardants, fungicides, and the like. Addtional stabilizers which are especially preferred for use in combination with UV stabilizer, prepared as described herein, are the antioxidants. The inclusion within the polymer composition of an antioxidant, in addition to the UV stabilizer, confers upon the polymer composition stability against two of the more environmentally hostile degradative forces. The antioxidant can be present within the polymer composition within the range of from about 0.1 to about 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight polymer, and preferably from about 0.2 to about 5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of polymer. Generally, the phenolic antioxidants are preferred for use in conjunction with the UV stabilizer of this invention. Examples of phenolic antioxidants are 2,6 dit butyl phenol 2 methyl 4,6 dinonyl phenol 2,6 di tbutyl p cresol 2,2 methylenebis 4 methyl 6 t butyl phenol l,l methylenebis 2 naphthol 4,4 methylene bis 2,6 di t butyl phenol 4,4 thiobis 6 t butyl m cresol and the like. Some of the more common and popular of the phenolic anti oxidants are the esters having alkylhydroxyphenyl substituents trazines having alkylhydroxyphenyl substituents and isocyanurates having alkylhydroxyphenyl substituents. Examples of phenolic antioxidants having alkylhydroxyphenyl substituents on an ester nucleus are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,330,859 and 3,627,725 and exemplified by di lauryl a, a bis 3, 5 di t butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl mal onate compounds exemplified by tetrakis methylene 3 3 ,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate methane and the like. Examples of phenolic antioxidant compounds having alkyhydroxyphenyl substituents on a heterocyclic nucleus are triazine compounds such as disclosed in U.K. Pat. No. 977,589 and exemplified by 2,4, 6 tris 4 hydroxy 3 ,5 di t butyl benzylthio 1,3,5 triazine disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,706,740 and exemplified by 2,4,6 tris 3 ,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl 1,3,5 triazine disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.3,567,724 and exemplified by hexahydro 1,3,5 tris B 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionyl s triazine disclosed inU.S. Pat. No. 3,694,440 and exemplified by 1,3,5 tris 4 hydroxy 3 , 5 di t butylphenylpropionyloxyethylthiopro pionyl hexahydro 1,3,5 triazine and the like. Examples of phenolic antioxidant compounds having alkylhydroxyphenyl substituents on an isocyanurate nucleus are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,531,483 and exemplified by tris 3, 5 di t butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl isocyanurate disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,678,047 and exemplified by 2,2 ,2 tris 3, 5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionyloxy ethyl isocyanurate and the like. Still other hindered phenols useful as thermal antioxidants are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,920,659, and in copending U.S. Patent applications Ser. No. 697,345 andSer. No. 697,387 which are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth. Ordinarily, a structural engineering grade resin can be compounded with the various types of stabilizer materials described hereinabove in accord with standard mixing techniques and equipment such as in a Banbury mixer, a Henschel mixer, a rubber mill, an extruder mixer or equivalent device. The various components of the composition may be physically intimately blended either in the absence of or in the presence of a common solvent or in a solvent which is capable of dissolving the polymer component of the composition yet substantially incapable of dissolving the stabilizer ingredients. Typical of such solvent dispersing agents include hexane or benzene.Subsequent to intimately dispersing the various components of the composition within one another, the dispersing agent if any can be removed by selective evaporation and the resultant resin recovered. The resin may thereafter be formed into useable products by a variety of standard techniques. The ultra violet light stability of the compositions of this invention is evaluated by exposing samples of a photosensitive plastic, with and without stabilizer, to a Xenon or carbon arc light in a Weather Ometer operating at temperatures of about 600C. The sample is considered to have been photodegraded when it has lost in excess of fifty percent 50 of its tensile strength as determined by ASTM D 638 76. In a typical test protocol, a pre selected quantity of UV stabilizer, antioxidant and other optional processing aids if any are compounded with an unstabilized photosensitive resin, such as polypropylene, and the compounded resin compression molded into sheets approximately 20 mils in thickness.Several sheets of plastic are usually prepared in the above manner, each having different stabilizers, at different concentrations. Subsequent to formation of the foregoing compounded resin into sheet material, a series of dumb bells are cut from each sheet and placed in aWeather Ohmeter. At 500 hours, or other pre selected intervals, one 1 dumb bell of each sample of compounded resin is removed from the Weather Ohmeter and its tensile strength measured on an Instron tensile testing device.The tensile strength of each sample is then compared to the values obtained from a sample cut from the same sheet which had not experienced any UV exposure. The sample is considered to have been photodegraded when it has experienced in excess of fifty percent 50 reduction in its tensile strength. EXAMPLES The Examples which follow further define, describe and illustrate the i process for the synthesis of polysubstituted a amino acetamide and ii evaluation of the stabilizer properties of the compounds obtained in such synthesis. Apparatus and procedures used in the foregoing process and evaluation of such samples are standard or as hereinbefore described. Parts and percentages appearing in such examples are by weight unless otherwise stipulated. EXAMPLE I Preparation of a t butylamino isobutyramide A three necked round bottomed flask, equipped with a reflux condensor, magnetic stirrer and a thermometer, is initially chilled by immersion of its base in an ice bath, and thereafer charged with 100 mmoles t butylamine,S mmoles a bromo isobutyramide, 0.5 mmoles benzyltri ethylammonium chloride. The flask is purged of air with an inert gas, such as argon, and 10 mmoles of 50 NaOH added dropwise to the charge over a period of ten minutes. After this initial period, the exotherm of the reaction plateaus.The contents of the flask are then heated and allowed to react overnight under ref fluxing conditions with mild agitation. Heating is thereafter discontinued, the contents of the flask diluted with water and the solids removed by filtration. The solids are thereafter washed with alternate solutions of water and methylene chloride for removal of reactant residues. Spectral and elemental analysis of the recovered product thus obtained are consistent with the structure of the title compound. EXAMPLE II The procedures of Examples I are repeated, except that the contents of the flask are heated under reflux conditions within one 1 hour after the addition of the NaOH to the charge, otherwise the synthesis proceeded essentially in the same manner. Upon completion of the reaction, the solids were separated from the charge by filtration. The filtrate was dried and concentrated to form an oil which yielded additional solids upon the addition of hexane.
