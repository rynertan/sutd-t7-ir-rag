# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROTECTING A PRE FORMED PROJECTING APPENDAGE DURING PLASTIC MOLDING

## Abstract
Method and apparatus are disclosed for injection mold ing a generally cylindrical sleeve like penile prosthesis from a thermoplastic or thermosetting material utilizing a male mold core and a pair of female mold halves in which the molded prosthesis has encased in a wall therein a portion of a pre formed length of resilient tubing, the remaining length and free end of the tubing extending from the molded prosthesis as a length of free tubing projecting therefrom. The apparatus includes a mandrel for carrying the mold core and is adapted for mounting between the female mold halves, and means for anchoring one end of the preformed tubing at a selected position on the mold core. The apparatus further includes a first portion of the tubing after the anchored one end positioned adjacent at least a portion of the mold core, a box like member on the mandrel and positionable adjacent the mold core surface for accepting and isolating the remaining length and free end of the tubing extending past a predetermined location for the tubing to exit the molded prosthesis. The box like member is carried in a recess between the female mold halves, the member having a cavity therein for storing and protecting the remaining length and free end of the tubing during the injection molding process.
