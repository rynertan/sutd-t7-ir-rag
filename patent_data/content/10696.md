# A driving system for driving a machine element in a repeated reciprocating movement along a linear path.

## Abstract
When a machine element 1 having a large mass is given a reciprocating movement the recurring changes in speed as well as direction of movement bring about that very great driving forces must be supplied, which cause varying stresses on the driving unit. In case the movement path of the machine element 1 is more or less vertical the force of gravity causes extra stresses on the machine ele ment. These difficulties are overcome in accordance with the invention by the help of a spring system 11 which on the one hand equalizes the effect of the force of gravity on the machine element 1 , on the other hand compensates the arising mass forces by absorbing, storing and emitting energy following the movement of the machine element 1 . Hereby the amount of applied driving force is reduced, so that shocks and vibrations occurring during the driving are effectively reduced.
