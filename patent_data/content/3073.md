# Electron beam welding machine.

## Abstract
An electron beam welding machine incorporating an indexable work table carrying parts to be welded from a loading position to a welding position under a stationery electron beam gun and then to an unloading station. The parts to be welded are carried in sealable pockets in the table through a sealed low volume space at atmospheric pressure into a first pre pumping station where air in the pocket is brought to a pressure intermediate atmospheric pressure and the pressure required during the welding of the parts. After pre pumping, the pockets are indexed to a second pumping station wherein the pocket is evacuated to the pressure suitable for welding. The table is then indexed to another station at the pre pumping pressure and then through another sealed space at atmospheric pressure to the ejection station. Providing sealed spaces at atmospheric pressure avoids the intake of a large volume of air at atmospheric pressure into the pumping system.
