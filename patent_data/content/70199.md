# Active devices for coded information arrangements.

## Abstract
An active device, such as the transponder of an identifi cation system, comprises a memory 31 for storing coded information and supplying it to a transmitter output 24, and data means independent of the memory for supplying further information to the output. As shown, the device has a battery and the data means comprises detectors 161, 162 which detect when the voltage of the battery falls below respective predetermined levels. When the voltage falls below a first level, detector 161 changes a bit in the information supplied by a data selector 32 to output 24. When the voltage falls below a second, lower level, detector 162 actuates a 2 bit data selector 163 to change all the bits supplied to the output to a constant value D Alternatively the data means comprises input connec tions Bo Bâ‚‡ arranged to receive signals representing the updated values of respective parameters. These signals are supplied to respective inputs of the data selector 32 independently of memory 31. The device has a memory protection circuit 410 which prevents a separate programming unit from changing the information in memory 31 unless the number and timing of an initial series of pulses correspond to a predetermined pattern. A number of active devices may be used in a coded information detection system comprising a number of polling sites 231 234 to which an interrogation signal is supplied in turn. If, at the beginning of an interrogation cycle, it is detected that no active device is present at a particular site, the rest of the cycle is skipped and the interrogation signal is supplied immediately to the next site.
