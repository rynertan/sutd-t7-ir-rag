# Hammer bank assembly having a backstop screw tip strip, and process for its manufacture.

## Abstract
A hammer bank assembly 10 for use in line printers. The assembly includes an extruded metal rear frame 12 having a uniform thickness and a plurality of machined mounting surfaces which are machined in accurate relationship with respect to one another. A pair of extruded plastic shoes 14, 16 are mounted to the top and bottom of the frame 12 and also include machined surfaces for accurately aligning them with respect to the frame. The shoes 14, 16 include a plurality of mounting slots 20, 21 which are cut by means of a gang cutter. The slots 20, 21 serve to accurately align a plurality of print hammers 22 in the shoes 14, 16 . The hammers 22 are insulated with respect to the frame 12 and the shoes 14, 16 in order to prevent sliding motion and subsequent wearing of the print hammers. Also disclosed are several methods of simplifying the construction procedure of the hammer bank assembly 10 .
