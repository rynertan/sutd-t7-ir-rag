# Miniature toggle switch sealed for soldering and method of its manufacture.

## Abstract
A miniature toggle switch is provided with a factory installed environmental sealed cover which stops solder, flux and cleaning solvents before they enter the contact cavity within the switch. The switch case 21 is enclosed in a second case 44 of plastic with a hardened layer of epoxy in the space between cases and across the open bottom of the second case to substantially encapsulate the switch. An annular bead 62 of hardened epoxy seals the toggle handle housing 23 in its aperture in the second case 44 to complete the seal.
