# NOVEL PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SILICON HYDRIDE.

## Abstract
Process for producing silicon hydride by using a mix ture of alkylaluminum hydride and trialkylaluminum as a reducing agent for silicon compounds, wherein a sufficient amount of an aluminum halide compound to convert at least 90 mol trialkylaluminum in said mixture into dialkylalumi num monohalide is added to said mixture prior to the reduc tion reaction. This process provides high quality silicon hydride in a high yield.
