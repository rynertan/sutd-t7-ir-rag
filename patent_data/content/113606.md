# ROTARY DISPLACEMENT PUMP

## Abstract
A rotary displacement pump comprising a housing having an inlet and an outlet, a first circular recess and a second circular recess within the first recess disposed eccentrically thereof with its periphery coincident with the periphery of the first recess at a point near the outlet. An annular rotor extends across the first recess to define with the housing a fluid flow passage which communicates with the inlet and outlet. The pump includes a blade supported by the housing so as to project through the rotor and be rotatable through the flow passage by the rotor, such that the tip of the blades is coincident with the periphery of the first recess.
