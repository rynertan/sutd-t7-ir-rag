# A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING THE SOUND FIELD IN A VEHICLE CABIN OR THE LIKE

## Abstract
The major resonance noise inducing engine vibration component is determined by sensing the ignition pulses produced by the engine ignition system and compared with pre stored data to ascertain if cabin resonance is apt to oc cur. In the event that resonance is predicted counter vibra tion is produced by a speaker or speakers. In addition to the basic engine speed parameter, the load on the engine e.g. throttle valve position, induction vacuum or the like and the gear ratio in which the transmission is operating may also be sensed to determine the need for the counter vibration.
