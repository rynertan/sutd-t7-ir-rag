## Description
Description MAGNETIC RECORDING MEDIA INCLUDING POST CHLORINATED POLYVINYL CHLORIDE CPVC Technical FieldThis invention relates to the field of flexible magnetic recording media, and to the composition of a magnetic ink which is coated onto a flexible nonmagnetic substrate during manufacture of the media. Background of the InventionThe present invention is an improvement upon the invention defined in U.S. Patents 4,284,750 and 4,303,738 which are incorporated herein by reference.These patents describe magnetic recording media having chromium dioxide magnetic particles in a polyurethane binder.The former patent describes use of the brand MORTHANE thermoplastic polyurethane, while the later patent describes the use of the brand ESTANE.It has been found that while these media operate well under most environments, rolls of such media, for example 500 foot 152,4m rolls of 1 2 inch 1,27 cm tape, having about a five inch 12,7 cm diameter hub, may exhibit excessive head drag when subjected to a high storage temperature of about 300C at a high relative humidity of, for example 85 R.H.This environmental condition tends to compress the dry ink layer, and cause the surface of the layer to become ultra smooth. This is particularly true of the length of tape on the inside of the roll, adjacent the reel s hub. When this inner length of tape is later passed over a magnetic head, excessive friction drag exists between the head and the tape. This tendency toward excessive drag appears to be more prevalent in media having chromium dioxide pigment, than in media having iron oxide pigment, perhaps because the chromium dioxide media has a smoother surface finish.This drag problem has been solved in the prior art by the relatively expensive expedient of providing a backcoating on the tape, i.e. a carbon containing coating on the side of the nonmagnetic substrate opposite the magnetic ink coating.This drag problem is also more pronounced in the present day small cartridge reels of tape, having for example an inner hub about two inches 5,08 cm in diameter. With reels having a small diameter hub, higher normal forces i.e. a force vector along the reel s radius are generated that is, the force with which the tape convolutions are packed, one upon the other, is higher.The present invention relates to unexpectedly eliminating this drag problem by incorporating post chlorinated polyvinyl chloride into the recording layer of the media.While the prior art, of which U.S. Patent 3,247,017 is typical, recognizes the use of chlorinated polyvinyl chloride CPVC in magnetic recording media, the prior art does not teach the use of post chlorinated CPVC in magnetic recording media, nor the solution to this drag problem by the use of post chlorinated CPVC particularly when such media includes chromium dioxide, ferromagnetic particles.U.S. Patents 3,649,541 and 3,840,400 are cited as examples of prior art magnetic recording media having a polyurethane binder and chromium dioxide magnetic particles. The InventionThe present invention is practiced by the use of post chlorinated CPVC in the polyurethane binder of magnetic recording media. More specifically, the media of the present invention utilizes chromium dioxide magnetic particles in media made up of the brand GEON CPVC RESINS 627x563 and 623x563 where the numbers 627, 625 and 623 define molecular weights and the brand MORTHANE 310 thermoplastic polyurethane resin. As a result, backcoating of the media is no longer necessary.While the present invention is not to be limited thereto, it has special utility where the media s tape reels have a small inner tape convolution hub.It is though that the present invention provides a harder dry ink layer, and as a result, the layer does not flow under conditions of pressure, elevated temperature and high humidity.While the term post chlorinated CPVC is well known in the art, it is appropriate to define it as CPVC polymer chains wherein the chlorine content of the majority of the chain s monomer units have been raised to the range of from 57 to 72 by weight.The GEON brand of post chlorinated CPVC, as used in the various examples of the present invention, is of the general type described in U.S. Patent 3,100,762, incorporated herein by reference. This product is post chlorinated to about 67 chlorine, by weight.In its broadest aspects, the present invention provide magnetic recording media comprising a ferromagnetic pigment, a urethane binder and post chlorinated CPVC. In its specific aspects, the present invention comprises chromium dioxide magnetic pigment in a volume percent of about 51 a polymeric binder, comprising the MORTHANE brand, in a volume percent of about 25 and the GEON brand post chlorinated CPVC in a volume percent of about 11, the remainder comprising crosslinker, lubricant and pigment dispersant. GEON is a trademark for a line of post chlorinated polyvinyl chloride resins by B.F. Goodrich Chemical Compagny. MORTHANE is a trademark for thermoplastic polyurethane resins byMorton Norwich Products, Inc.Media formulations which incorporate the present invention include 1 ferromagnetic magnetic pigment, preferably chromium dioxide, in about 51 volume percent 2 a polymeric binder, preferably polyurethane of the MORTHANE brand, in a 18 to 29 volume percent range, and 3 a post chlorinated CPVC, preferably the brand GEON, in an 18 to 7 volume percent range.Of the remaining 13 volume percent, a TDS lubricant, as described in aforesaid U.S. Patent 4,303,738 is desirable, and in a range of about 6 volume percent and a pigment dispersant, preferably YELKIN TS brand Ross Rowe, Inc. of soybean lecithin, is desirable, and in a range of about 7 volume percent.While not necessary, it may be that those skilled in the art will want to add about 1 volume a crosslinker, such as theMONDUR MRS Mobay Chemical Co. of polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate.The amount of chromium dioxide to be used in the practice of the present invention is not critical. The above stated preferred amount is used in the following examples. Those skilled in the art may wish, however, to depart from this amount, while practicing the present invention.The new and unusual results achieved by the present invention is apparent from the following Comparative Example IV as compared to Examples I, II and III of the present invention. Comparative Example IV is a chromium dioxide media whose binder comprises only MORTHANE. Examples I, II and III are chromium dioxide media in accordance with the present invention, having mixtures ofMORTHANE and GEON in the following MORTHANE GEON volume percents 18 18 25 11 and 29 7 respectively.The finely divided magnetic pigment used in the practice of the present invention is not critical, and is of the general type known to those of skill in the art.

Comparative TestingThe above examples are all understood to comprise flexible magnetic recording media wherein the chromium dioxide particle containing layer is carried by a conventional, nonmagnetic web of thin polyester film such as the brand MYLAR E.I. du Pont de Nemours Co. Methods of mixing, solvents used, and methods of coating and finishing are well known to those of skill in the art, and will not be described herein.All examples were without a backcoat.Reels of 1 2 inch 1,27 cm wide tape were wound, at normal usage, constant tension and or torque, and on 50 millimeter diameter hubs, using 100 meters of tape for each of the four above examples. These small hub diameter reels were stored at 300C and 85 R.H. for 28 days. They were then removed from this environment and left at ambient temperature and humidity for 24 hours before being tested for head drag.Head drag was determined from beginning of tape BOT to end of tape EOT by mounting each supply reel to one side of a magnetic head, and pulling the tape over the head onto another take up reel which was driven by a motor whose drive current was calibrated to read the force necessary to drag the tape over the head. While the exact test means, for example the angle of tape wrap of the head, is not critical, it must be the same for all reels,in order to make a valid comparison.This drive current calibrated force was measured at 10 meter intervals, from BOT to EOT. The results for these four tapes are tabulated in the following table. By definition, EOT is the tape adjacent the reel s inner hub. FORCE IN GRAMS AT 10 METER INTERVALS ALONG TAPES BOT EOTMeters 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100Example I 15 18 22 27 24 24 26 29 28 38 II 16 13 13 14 16 15 18 21 20 29 III 15 16 16 16 20 23 27 32 38 41 IV 19 23 58 110 141 FORCE TOO LARGE FOR MOTOR TO MOVE TAPEAs is seen from the table, head drag increased so much in theComparative Example IV tape the tape without CPVC , that the motor could no longer pull the tape over the magnetic head in the mid reel to EOT regions. With the tapes of the present invention, the head drag increased only marginally from BOT 10 meters to EOT 100 meters . As is apparent from the above, the present invention exhibits much less drag than does Comparative Example IV.While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
