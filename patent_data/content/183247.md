# HIGH PRESSURE METAL HALIDE LAMP WITH XENON BUFFER GAS

## Abstract
High pressure xenon is used as a buffer gas in place of mercury in a high pressure sodium iodide arc discharge lamp. Xenon buffer gas has a more favorable influence than mercury on the sodium D line spectrum and does not react with halides in the lamp fill. The use of xenon buffer gas increases the efficacy of the high pressure sodium iodide arc lamp.
