# Journal mounted rotary joint.

## Abstract
A rotary joint for a rotating heat exchanging drum 10 directly attached to the end of the drum journal 14 utilizes a flange 18 and adapter 28 to mount a seal 38 on the journal 14 and the joint body 50 is fixed with respect to the journal 14 and supports a seal plate 72 in which an annular seal 84 is biased toward the journal 14 mounted plate 72 by springs 102 . The body 50 mounted seal includs differential pressure area surfaces 92 to balance the fluid pressures imposed thereon, and the springs 102 are isolated from the fluid within the body 50 . The joint eliminates metal to metal engagement of moving parts, and the seals may be readily replaced when worn.
