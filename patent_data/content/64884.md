# Method and apparatus for coating by glow discharge.

## Abstract
In a glow discharge coating process, a gaseous com pound of a metal species including a semi metal is reacted with another gaseous substance by glow discharge gener ated between an electroconductive workpiece 813 connected to a cathode 817, a secondary cathode 812 provided at a position near enough to the workpiece to generate interac tions of glow discharge between the workpiece and the secondary cathode, and an anode 816. The total pressure of not more than 10 Torr, and the partial pressure of the gaseous compound of metal species is not more than that of the said other gaseous substance. Selected portions of the workpiece are thus coated with the resulting reaction product containing the said metal species. The coating can be carried out under a lower voltage with less electric power.
