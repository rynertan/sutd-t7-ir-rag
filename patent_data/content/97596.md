# Method and well logging tool for measuring a characteristic of a flowing fluid.

## Abstract
A well logging tool, for use within a well borehole having a flowing fluid therein, has a selective bypass means for directing a portion of the flowing fluid away from the housing of the well logging tool upon the flowing fluid exerting a predetermined pressure force upon a packer, whereby damage to the packer from increased pressure forces is minimized and flow characteristics of a fluid flowing at widely varying flow rates may be measured.
