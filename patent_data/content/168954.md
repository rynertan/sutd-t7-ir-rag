# Process for the production of expanded particles of a polypropylene resin.

## Abstract
A process for the production of expanded particles, which comprises providing an aqueous dispersion containing expand able particles which are formed of polypropylene resin and which contain a blowing agent and an expansion aid and main tained at a temperature higher than the softening point of the resin and under a pressurized condition, and subjecting the dis persion to a lower pressure so that the expandable particles are expanded. The expansion aid is organic or inorganic solids hav ing a particle size of 0.1 to 150 Âµm and a melting point higher than the temperature at which the expansion of the expandable particles is performed and serves to improve the expansion ratio.
