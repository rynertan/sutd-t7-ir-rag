# Optical scanning device.

## Abstract
An optical scanning device for scanning a document to produce image signals related to the density of the image on successively scanned document areas includes a platen 10 for supporting a document and a surface 50 of substantially uniform reflectivity extending along the edge of the platen. A bar of light 58 is directed so as to strike the document and the surface 50 of substantially uniform reflectivity and moves across the document in synchronization with optical scanning of the document. Light reflected from the surface of substan tially uniform reflectivity is directed to a plurality of reference transducers 52, 54 which sense the position of the bar of light. A servo control loop 60, 64 , responsive to the reference transducers, positions a reflector 42 during the scanning op eration so that the area on the document being scanned is properly illuminated.
