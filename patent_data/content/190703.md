# Control system for hydraulic circuit.

## Abstract
A control system 32 and a method for controlling a hydraulic circuit 30 having on off valves 5a, 5b interposed between the control valve 3 and the actuator 4 for allowing and blocking a flow of hydraulic fluid therebetween, in which the control valve and on off valves are actuated and switched in accordance with an operation signal from an operation device 11, 11A . Pressure sensors 7, 8, 9, 10 are connected to hydraulic lines 30a, 30b, 30c, 30d upstream and downstream of the on off valves for detecting the pressures P
