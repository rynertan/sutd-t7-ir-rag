# Washout resistant coating or caulking compositions and applications thereof.

## Abstract
Water based coating or caulking compositions especially for exterior surfaces or seams which upon application quickly develop resistance to being washed out by rain comprise an aqueous dispersion of water insoluble latex polymer prepared by emulsion polymerization, pigment dispersed with anionic poly mer, and water soluble salt of multivalent complex ion having ligands selected from ammonia or organic amine, and have a total solids content of from 50 to 90 by weight. Those compositions having a pigment to binder ratio of 1 1 to 3 1 are particularly useful as roof mastics.
