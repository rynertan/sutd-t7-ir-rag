# Method and surveillance system for detecting the presence of an e.m. wave receptor reradiator.

## Abstract
A surveillance system transmits a microwave carrier signal through a surveillance zone 14 . Two low frequency energy fields are also established in the zone being produced by respective pairs of closely spaced apart low frequency signals radiated from opposite sides of the zone. A receptor reradiator in the zones receives these signals and reradiates a reply signal to a receiver 36 the reply signal consisting of the microwave carrier signal amplitude modulated in accordance with the instantaneous value of the low frequency fields at the location of the receptor reradiator. The receiver separates out preselected intermodulation products and activates an alarm only when the preselected intermodulation products are present.
