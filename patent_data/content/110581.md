# Process and apparatus for surface alloying by diffusion steel material in coil form, and the products thereof.

## Abstract
Steel material 12 , such as sheet steel, supplied in coil form, is provided with a corrosion resistant surface by a continu ous process in which at least one alloying element, e.g. chromium, is diffused into the surface of the material in a molten lead bath. The steel material 12 is uncoiled, then preheated, continuously drawn through the lead bath 26 containing the alloying element or elements, then cooled, and finally recoiled. When the steel to be treated does not contain any titanium, the molten lead bath includes titanium in order to improve the corrosion resistance of the final product. The steel material 12 enters and leaves the lead bath 26 through tubes 80 and 85 which allow the material to be preheated and cooled under controlled conditions. Also, the diffusion alloying element is added to the lead bath 26 through one or more tubes in a manner which allows the element to dissolve in and permeate the lead bath while retaining any debris associated with the element in the tube and thereby preventing contamination of the surface of the material 12 .
