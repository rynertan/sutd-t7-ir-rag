## Description
NWEL BICYCLIC ALCOHOL AND INSECTICIDA1 ESTER DERIVATIVE THEIRPRODUCTION, AND COtSOSITIONS CONTAINING AND INSECTICIDAL METHODS USING TIlE ESTERS The present invention ts directed to a novel alcohol for use in preparing cyclopropanecarboxylate and related insecticides, to insecticides employing this alcohol, to an insecticidal method and composition and to processes for production of the alcohol and its insecticidal esters. More particularly, the invention is directed to a 7 oxabicycloheptadienylmethanol and insecticidal esters therep. Pyrethrins, naturally occurring extracts of chrysanthemum flowers, have long been of interest as insecticides. Since elucidation of the structures of these compounds, synthesis efforts have been directed toward preparation of related compounds having enhanced insecticidal activity and improved stability toward air and light. Since a prerequisite for insecticidal activity of pyrethroids is the presence in one molecule of an appropriate acid moiety and an appropriate alcohol moiety, research in the art has been directed toward novel acid and or alcohol radicals. Noteworthy advances in the area of alcohol research were the discovery of 5 benzyl 3 furylmethyl alcohol, then of the more photostable 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol. Similarly significant advances have been made in pyrethroid acid research.The commercial insecticide permethrin, the common name for 3 phenoxyphenylmethyl 3 2,2 dichloroethenyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, exemplifies use of both newer acid and alcohol moieties in a single compound. The present invention provides a novel bicyclic alcohol and certain ester derivatives thereof which have a high level of insecticid l activity. In this application, the term lower as applied to an aliphatic hydrocarbon group means having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 tp 4 carbon atoms, The term halo or halogen means bromine chlorine or fluorine.The tcr3n haloalkyl means an alkyl group of 1 to 3 carbon atoms substituted with 1 or more halogen atoms and includes perhaloalkyl of 1 to 3 carbon atoms. These definitions are applicable throughout the specification and claims except where a contrary meaning is clearly indicated. The novel compounds of this invention have the generalEMI2.1 wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom, a cyano group, an ethynyl group, a haloalkyl group, an aminocarbonyl group, or an aminothioxomethyl group R2 and R3, the same or different, are nitro, halogen, cyano, lower alkyloxycarbonyl, lower alkylsulfinyl, lower alkylsulfonyl, or the group CONR6R7 or So2NR6R7 where R6 and R7 are independently hydrogen, lower alkyl, or halo lower alkyl R4 is phenyl, benzyl, or benzoyl, optionally substituted with halogen or lower alkyl R5 is hydrogen, 2,2,3,3 tetramethylcyclopropylcarbonyl, 1 4 chlorophenyl 2 methylpropyl 1 carbonyl, or a cyclopropanecarboxylic acid residue of the formula EMI2.2 wherein Y and Z, the same or different, are hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, haloalkyl, phenyl optionally substituted with halogen or lower alkyl, or phenylthio optionally substituted with halogen or lower alkyl. Particularly useful insecticides of the present invention are the cyclopropanecarboxylates in which one of Y and Z is halogen, such as chlorine or bromine, and the other, the same or different, is halogen or a haloalkyl group such as trihalomethyl, R1 is hydrogen, R2 and R3 are each lower alkyloxycarbonyl, and R4 is benzyl. The cyclopropanecarboxylates having the acid residue of formula II have cis and trans isomeric forms, i.e., the carboxy and the substituted vinyl groups at the 1 and 3 positions of the cyclopropane ring are either cis or trans with respect to each other. Preparation of these compounds will usually yield a mixture of the cis and trans isomers, designated herein as cis, trans, in which the ratio of cis to trans may vary over a wide range. For purposes of this application the designations cis and trans are assigned in accordance with P.E. Burt, et al., Pestic. Sci., 5 791 799 1974 .The compounds of this invention may also exist as E or Z isomers or as mixtures of E and Z isomers, designatedE,Z, depending upon the spatial relationship of substituents on the a carbon of the vinyl group to those on the carbon of the vinyl group. In the cyclopropanecarboxylate art it is known there may be substantial differences in the level of insecticidal activity of the cis and trans isomers. In general, as between the cis and trans isomer of a given cyclopropanecarboxylate, the cis isomer is usually more active than the trans and also more active than the cis,trans mixture. Similar differences in activity may also occur with respect to the E and Z isomers. Unless a contrary intent is specifically expressed, this invention embodies and includes both cis and trans isomeric forms of the claimed compounds as well as mixtures thereof wherein the cis to trans ratio is within the range of 0 100 to 100 0. Similarly, while the invention is illustrated with a mixture of the E andZ isomers, the individual isomers, as well as the mixtures, are contemplated by and within the scope of the invention. The various enantiomers of the claimed compounds and mixtures of them are also included within the scope of the invention. The insecticidal compounds of this invention may be prepared in a number of ways. The schemata below for 2 ,3 bis methoxycarbonyl 4 phenylmethyl 7 oxabicy clo 2.2.1 hepta 2,4 diene 6 ylmethyl 3 2,2 dichloroethenyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate is illustrative of methods by which the compounds can be prepared. In Route A, an appropriate ester is converted via a cycloaddition reaction with an acetylenic compound to the novel ester I, the cycloaddition reaction and the point of novelty being the last step in the process. InRoute B the cycloaddition of the acetylenic compound is to an appropriate alcohol to give the novel bicyclic alcohol II which is then converted by methods analogous to those known in the art to the novel ester I.In this latter route, novelty attaches in the first step of the process. The reactions may be conducted at room temperature or above, for example 20 C to 1500C depending on the solvent employed in the reaction. The Examples which follow illustrate preparation of the insecticidal compounds and novel intermediates therefor in accordance with the general methods described above. In the Examples, all temperatures are in degrees centigrade and all pressures in mm. Hg.
