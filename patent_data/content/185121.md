# Shock absorbent connector.

## Abstract
The invention, in its preferred form, provides a manually held leash, lead, line or the like for large and strong animals which incorporates a shock absorbing device 13 for diminishing the effect of the force or strain transmitted when the animal suddenly and forcibly pulls, lunges, bolts, jumps, etc. The shock absorber incorporates resilient shock absorb ing means automatically operative to oppose the force exerted by the animal and to diminish its effect on the manually held leash. The device is constituted of a pneuma tic cylinder 32 the piston 73 of which is connected to the animal and normally is retained in a retracted position by a compressive spring 49 against which the animal pulls. In addition to the restraining force imposed by the spring on the piston, compressed air also is utilized to absorb the shock of the animal s pulling force. The shock absorbent leash of the invention reduces the potential for injury to a person holding the leash, in the event the animal exerts a sudden and substantial force thereon. The invention has a variety of other applications where connectors joining two separate entities, bodies or objects are subjected to sudden force or strain. Examples of such connectors are vehicle tow lines, tie down lines for aircraft, tent guy ropes, mooring lines for boats, swing chains, and the like.
