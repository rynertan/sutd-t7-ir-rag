# Universal fifth wheel hitch with controlled transverse movement.

## Abstract
A support for a tilt stabilizing fifth wheel hitch that connects a truck tractor to a trailer, the fifth wheel plate 12 being on a movable frame having a pair of convex shoes 34 connected by a tie rod 40 and resting on concave bearing plates 52 on a fixed frame 38 , the movable frame being movable on the fixed frame toward either of two opposite extreme positions from an intermediate neutral position. The movable frame is biased away from these extreme positions toward the intermediate position by variable force biasing means, preferably coil compression springs 60 on the tie rod, which apply increasing biasing force with increased movement of the movable frame toward one of the said extreme positions, thereby enabling the truck driver to sense or feel the tilted condition of his trailer relative to his tractor during operation.
