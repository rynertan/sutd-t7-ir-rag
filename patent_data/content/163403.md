# Wholly aromatic polyamide fiber.

## Abstract
Surface frictional characteristics of a wholly aromatic polyamide fiber are desirably modified by applying to the fiber at least 0.5 by weight, based on the fiber, of a reaction product of a polyoxyethylene adduct of glyceride having at least one hydroxyl group in the molecule with a dibasic acid and or a dibasic anhydride. Preferably, prior to the applica tion of the reaction product, at least 0.01 by weight of an inorganic compound powder is applied to the fiber.
