## Description
Short title System for generating digital signals corres ponding to selectable functions The invention relates to a system for generating digital signals corresponding to functions of a selectable number of variables, said functions corresponding to a selectable analytical relation and being of the type that can be described in a discrete form by a differentialrelation or a simultaneous system of differential relations and at least one boundary condition or initial condition. In the prior art systems of said type usually said functions were point by point generated by discrete integration of a difference equation or a system of differ nce equations. Practically thereto use was made of prcarammable hard ware calculating apparatus in combi nation with adequate soft ware. For such a calculating method for each point to be generated of the function a number of calculating steps ave to be performed. If certain requirements are imposed to the resolution, i.e. the step size may not exceed a certain value, this imposes limitations to the rate with which functions can be generated. In view to certain application fields to be mentioned hereafter, this lack of sufficient rate can be very inconvenient or even prevent use. The invention aims to offering a solution for the disadvantages mentioned of the prior art and thereto provides a system of the type described in the preamble, said system according to the invention being characterized by 1. a signal generator for forming binary signals for each of said two variables, said signals being representative for said differential relation s and said at least one boundary condition or initial condition for each 2. comparing means for successively comparing, in the direction from the most significant bit MSB to the least significant bit LSB , bits of equal significance of said signals, each of which corresponds to one variable 3. rolling point determining means for determining a rolling point on basis of at least one of said comparing operations, said rolling point being a point determined by the values of said variables and relative to which a preceding part of said function, considered to be graphically displayed in a orthogonal coordinate system, is rolled over 180 so as to obtain a next part of said function connected to said preceding part and 4. memory means for memorizing signals corresponding to at least said last mentioned next part of said function in the form of bit groups. The system according to the invention is able to generate functions, e.g. cor responding with straight lines circles, parabolic curves, or trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, exponential functions, Besselfunctions, line figures in multi dimensional spaces, e.g. helxes, planes, conic sections, spheres, solids of revo a te being a factor 10 to 1 0 t as high as can be obtained with the known prior art systems. The system according to the invention is suited for performing the most diverging arithmetical and other mathematical operations, e.g. multiplying squaring generating of functions of the most various kinds integration determining logarithms determining inverse functions determining for a given function of a value or values of one variable corresponding to a selected value of other variables determining conic section designing nomographs performing coordinate transformations etc. Several applications can be mentioned, among others displaying a function on a graphic display, e.g. a picturescreen or a x y plotter use as function generator for universal application controlling tool machinery, such as drilling machines and fret saw machines performing calculations for designing e.g. integrated circuits. A system according to the invention, being suited for generating digital signals corresponding to curves may be characterized by second comparing means for, after forming a new part of said function, successively comparing, in the direction from the least significant bit LSB to the most significant bit MSB , bits of equal significance of said signals each corresponding to one variable, the output signals of said second comparing means in case of detection of the first unchanged bits group being fed to said rolling point determinina means for changing a previously determined rolling point. The rolled part will in general be smaller now. In this way by integration of the difference equation or of the system of simultaneous difference equations a curve can be generated.Previously found points are according to the described procedure dynamically being accounted for. The invention further relates to a system for subjecting selectable curves to selectable transformations. Such a system is known in various implementations For fotocopying purposes for instance most often use is made of an optic system, comprising lenses, mirrors and the like, which the aid of which magnifications and reductions, rotations, translations, dilatations and combinations thereof, e.g. direction dependent rescaling, can be accomplished. Such a prior art system is mechanically complicated, it has a limited flexibility as optical systems most often offer a limited area of configurations having acceptable picture qualities, and it is vulnerable and therefore not fully reliable.An improvement relative to the optical systems is formed by the electronic calculating systems, in which calculation of a transformed curve from a given curve is performed in soft ware, proaramm controlled A system of this last mentioned type, however, has a relative complicated construction and is not able to work at a high rate, due to the necessarily large number of programm steps. An important application of the mentioned electronic is related to the text processing apparatus or word processors. As particularly for such processors a high processing speed is of the utmost importance, the invention has at its purpose to provide an electronic curvestransformation system having a processing speed which is substantially larger than the speed of the prior art systems. A further purpose of the invention is to provide an electronic transformation system that is also adapted to function at high speed in more dimensions. In this connection the attention is drawn for instance to potential application in industrial robots, or manipulators ill which e.g. use is made of a number independent elements each having three degrees of freedom of translation and three decrees of freedom of rotation. In order to realize the above purposes the invention provides a system of the type set out in the preamble, said system comprising 1 addressable first memory means having a number of memory positions, in each of which a data word con sisting of a linear combination with the multiplica tion factors 0, 1 or 1 of the elements a.. of the 13 matrix representing a selected transformation is stored, said data words forming a complete set 2 second memory means for storing the coordinate data of a selected curve according to a discreet points grid 3 computing means connected with the outputs of said first and second memory means for computing by means of matrix multiplication of successive points of the transformed curve, a displacement in one dimension over one elementary grid distance being represented by a displacement bit DXi, DYi, DZi ... and a direction bit SX, SY, SZ, ... , said displacement bit indicating whether or not said curve displaces according to the coordinate axis involved in the direction indicated by said direction bit, the possible address words for said first memorymeans consisting of the complete set of combinations of displacement bits and direction bits. Further features and details of the system according to the invention will be mentioned and elucidated referring to the drawings, which in view of the simplicity of the drawing mainly relates to a two dimensional case.In the drawings Fig. 1 shows a part of the discretized x y plane Fig. 2 a schematically presented rolling operation, which is the basis of the system according to the invention Fig. 3 shows the four possible rolling points in one quadrant Fig. 4 shows the construction of a straight line according to the invention Fig. 5 shows the construction of an exponential curve according to the invention Fig. 6 shows the construction of a circle arc according to the invention Fig. 7 shows a geometric schematic diagram as an illustration of the way in which according to the invention multiplying and dividing can be performed Fig. 8a shows a schematic presentation of aDx and a Dy register Fig. 8b shows a graphical presentation of the order number of a selected bit couple depending on the moments of selection Fig. 9 shows a schematic diagram of a system according to the invention for generating straight lines Fig. 10 shows a bit couple selection unit forming part of the system according to fig. 9 Fig. 11 shows a data unit forming part of the system according to fig. 9 Fig. 12 shows an input output unit forming part of the system according to fig. 9 Fig. 13 shows another embodiment of the bits couple selection unit Fig. 14 shows a system according to the invention that is also adapted for generating curves Fig. 15 shows a schematic diagram of the checkunit forming part of the system according to fig. 14 Fig. 16 shows a schematic diagram of the comparitormodule forming part of the system according to fig. 14. Fig. 17 a schematic representation of the formation of a two dimensional curve Fig. 18 a block schematic diagram of a calculating assembly according to the invention Fig. 19 two examples of fonts of a text processing apparatus, which fonts can be described by a single contour or an inner contour together with an outer contour Fig. 20a a square as an example of a curve to be transformed Figures 20b to 20d examples of figures generated from the square according to fig. 20a by certain linear transformations and Fig. 3 a block diagram of the transformationsystem according to the invention. Fig. 1 shows a two dimensional points grid as a part of the discretized x y plane. Both coordinates can only assume values corresponding with the natural numbers 0, ...., N. The point A indicated as example has the coordinates XA, Yea , Fig. 2 shows in which way points indicated with three crosses x , correspbnding with a part of a discrete graph, can be used for forming a further part of said graph connected thereto. The grid points are indicated with .1 Use is made of a rolling operation , i.w. in a manner to be described in more detail a rollinp point o is chosen, and afterwards each point x is moved over 180 with respect to that point o . In this way the points indicated are generated.This rolling operation is mathematically identical with multiplication of a discrete curve with 1 or two successive mirror operations with respect to two orthogonal axes having arbitrary orientation through the rolling point o .The points thus obtained can for a next operation serve as points of the graph. The position of the rolling is determined by a bits group, which for this two dimensional case consists of so bits and thus may be referred to as a bit couple , i.e. a characterizing of determining quantity kDxi, Dyi , consisting of two binary numbers.It will be appreciated that four bit couples and thus also four rolling points are possible. Fig. 3 shows these four possibilities under the assumption that the first bit gives a movement in downward direction for the value 1 and for the value 0 no movement in downward direction and the second bit for the value 1 a movement in the right hand direction and for the value 0 no movement in the right hand direction. Thus for fig. 3a Dxi, Dyi 1,l fig. 3b Dxi, Dy. 1,0 fig. 3c Dxi, Dy. 0,0 fig. 3d Dxi, Dy. 0,1 . 1 1 The bit couples are formed on basis of the binaryBCD presentation of the characteristic numbers Dx and Dy to be described in more detail later. Of these binary numbers from the most significant bit MSB through the least significant bit LSB the bits of equal significance are couple wise combined. As an example Dx 12 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 Dy 9 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1Bit couples 0,0 , 0,0 , 0,0 , 0,0 , 1,1 , 1,0 , 0,0 , 0,1 . The significance of a bit couple gives a weight to the selected direction. It is to be noted that with the four possible bitcouples only one quadrant is covered. In order to be able to use all four quadrants in the flat plane further a direction couple Sx, Sy is introduced. The four possible direction couples have the following meanings Sx, Sy 1,1 increasing x, decreasing y Sx, Sy 0,0 decreasing x, decreasing y Sx, Sy 1,0 increasing x, decreasing y Sx, Sy 0,1 decreasing x, increasing y Anticipating to the implementation to be discussed later it is here already noted that the direction couple serves for the incrementing or decrementing of the xand y registers. The sign changes at the moment on which the register values pass zero. As an example now follows a description of the construction of a straight line Dx, Dy with Dx a andDy b, a and b being constants.The successive rollingpoints are Dxi, Dy. for i 1,...., n 1 DISB n LSB , in which n number of bits in the BCD presentation of a and b.Fig. 4 shows as an example a case in which a 10 and b 6. a 10 1010 b 6 0110Therefor, the rolling points are successively 1,0 , see fig. 4a 0,1 , see fig. 4b 1,1 , see fig. 4c 0,0 , see fig. 4d In view of the previous discussion it will be clear that according to the indicated principle only n number of bits logical desicions are required for each time doubling the construction through the rolling points. The principles described in the previous text part can now be generalized in the framework of integrating a difference equation of the following form Dx F x,y,z, Dy G x,y,z, in which z an arbitrary function. In the cache of a straight line Dx a DyThe roll points were successivel taken from the NSB tc We LSB. In the generalized case the previous remark still holds, provided that the previously found ro ling points have not changed. If, however, a change as occured the procedure returns in the direction LSB to MSB until the first bit that has remained unchanged. This implies that the rolled part will be smaller now. Thus by integration a curve can develope in which dynamically previous points are being taken into account. Figure 5 shows the construction of an exponential curve responding to the difference equation Dx x Dy a in which a 9. As an illustration of the construction according to figure 5 the following schematic survey may serve EMI10.1 As roughly indicated in fig. 5 there exists a continuous movement of the rolling point position in both directions. This movement forms the balance between the rate at which graphs can be generated and the stability. The resolution is determined by the bit resolution as obviously using more bits the discretized curve forms a better approximation of the analoge curve to be simulated, so that at a greater bit resolution the procedure penetrates deeper to the less significant bits, so that also the information contained in these bits is used. Fig. 6 shows the manner in which the arc of a circle can be generated. The difference equation corresponding therewith has the form Dx Z Dy x The following schematic survey may serve as illustration of the graphical construction showed in fig 6 EMI11.1 As has been noted already also difference equations arranged as a simultaneous system can be solved.As an example the following system is mentioned Dx Y Dz A with x o U thus x U cos A V sin x Dz A with y o V z z thus y U sin A V cos This circular tranformation can be used for generating a sine function U B and V 0 , polar coordinates transformation . , U, V z,x as y 0 vice versa , and rotation in a flat plane The linear transformation can further be applied for performi multiplication or division. E.g. fig. 7 shows x C .For multiplication C C 2n, therefor x EMI11.2 following relation holds For division B 2 , therefor x EMI11.3 By application of this transformation a rescaling can be performed of the junction points of a construction consisting of straight lines and curved lines. The several parts of the curves are generated again on a different scale. The generation of a vector is only a specific example of the integration of the general set of differentialrelation DX F X,Y,Z, ... DY G X,Y,Z, ... DZ H X,Y,Z, in which X,Y,Z, ... are independent variables and DX,DY, DZ, ... are differentials of these variables. It can be proved that a system of n differential relations is is equivalent with a differential equation of the order n l . The formulation can further be generalized by using partial diffentials, for instance DXZ or the 7differential in the X direction and DyZ orthe Z differential in the Y direction. Applying the adequate initial conditions or boundary conditions the solutions are curves of planes in a n dimensional space. The system according to the invention is adapted to integrate a general system of differential relations.The procedure is a selection of bits groups equally significant bits of the binary coded numbers DX, DY, DZ, .. which represent the position of rolling points in a n dimensional space. The order of the selection of bits groups as well as the bits groups themselves may change. This is caused by the differential relations being evaluated on certain moments through the functions F, G, H ....A possible strategy is the functions F, G, H, ... only being evaluated in the rolling points and the normal order of the bits group selection being reset to that particular bits group of which all more significant bits groups have remained unchanged after the evaluation. This interruption and resetting of the normal procedure of bits group selection causes a forming by rolling off of line parts having variable lengths. These line parts also have variable directions however, they continuously overlap one another, so that a continuous curve is being generated. As an example the solution of the system of differential relations DX Y initial conditions X0 A DY X Y0 B DZ C 20 0 The projection of the solution a helix in the X,Yplane and the projections in the X, Z and Y,Z planes are trigonometric functions X2 Y2 A2 B2 X A cos Z C B sin Z C Y A sin z C B cos Z C After the previous illustrations of the principles according to the invention and the examples of application thereof for the ccnstruction of two dimensional graphic patterns now a discussion on the arrangement of the system according to the invention will follow. First of 411 a system for generating straight curves will be presented. As has been discus sea earlier the sequence of .e selection of the bit couples from MSB to LSB ni constant. Figures 8A and 83 illustrate this. Fig. 8A shows schematically a Dx register 1 and a Dy JJgister 2, both registers being of the BCD type.Acrding to fig. 8A these registers are arranged such that bits with equal significances are positioned on the same horizontal positions the B takes the ultimate left hand position and the LSB takes the ultimate righthand position. The numbers under the Dy register 2 indicate the order numbers of the bit couples DxoZ DyO , Dx1, Dye , etc., respectively. Fig. 8B shows the order number of the selected bit couple 0,1,2,3,4,5, etc. , in dependance of the time, i.e. the successive moments on which a bit couple is selected. For this secruation the attention is drawn to the mirror effect of the previous series of selected bit couples around each rolling point. The point 1 is a symmetry point for the line between 0 and 2. The point 3 is a symmetry point for the line between 0 and 6. The point 7 is a symmetry point for the line between 1 and 14. The point 15 is a symmetry point for the line between 0 and 30. Fig. 9 shows the schematic diagram of a system adapted for generating signals corresponding with straight curves. The figure shows an example for the case of N 8 or 9 bit couples. In the system according to fig. 9 three units are indicated with dotted lines the bit couple selection unit or checking unit 3 a data unit 4, of which theDx register 1 and the Dy register 2 forms part and all input output unit 5. A clock signal applied through an input 6 controls a digital 9 bits counter 7. This counter is of the common binary BCD type the respective counting values at the multiple output are presented in table I. Table I output signal of the order number of counter 7 the selected bit coupleEMI15.1 As is apparent 512 clock pulses or timing units form one complete cycle. The multiple output of the counter 9 is connected with bit couple selection means 8 in which for each condition of the counter one of the nine possible bit couples is selected see table 1 and is applied to two 9 bits registers, namely the registers 1 and 2 mentioned already, comprising the increments decrements Dx and Dy in BCD code. These registers 1 and 2 can at the beginning of the procedure or of the 512often cycle be loaded with the decrementsDx and Dy, namely through the inputs 9 and 10.If the bit couple i has been selected this bit couple Dxir Dy1 is from the outputs of the data unit 4 fed to an interpretation module 11 forming part of the input output unit 5 and in which said bit couple is combined with a direction couple applied through two inputs 12, 13 for forming control.signals for two registers 14, 15 comprising the absolute x position and the absolute y position,respectively. In the beginning of the cycle these two registers comprise the beginning position of the line to be constructed and at the end of the cycle they comprise the final position. The intermediate points can now be delivered through the outputs 16, 17 for memorizing in a memory, for graphic display or direct read out for the case the system is used as a function generator. Fig. 10 shows an example of the bit couple selection unit 3 presented in fig. 9 Fig. 11 shows an embodiment of the data unit 4 presented in fig. 9 Fig. 12 shows an embodiment of the input output unit 5 according to fig. 9. These units will successively be discussed now. Fig. 10 the clock signal Z1 applied to the input 6 controls a coupled series of elementary dividers by two or bistable flip flops 58 66. These dividers form together a 9 bits binary counter. As indicated in table 1 each counting position corresponds with one single bit couple selection This selection takes place with the aid of a circuit of binary logics and results in 9 bit couple selection signals S0,....,S8. , S8. Thus e.g. the line S3 is activated i.e. the bit couple 3 is selected at the counting position 0000111 or 7. Fig. 11 the decrements Dx and Dy are considered to be present in two 8 bits registers, comprising mono stable flip flops, the read in operation taking place under the influence of a LoAD signal applied to an input 68. The outputs of these flip flops all comprise buffers, 71 79 and 80 88 respectively, controllable by Si, so that at a bit couple selection S. the bit couple Dx., Dy. appears i i I at two outputs 69 and 70. Fig. 12 this bit couple determines, together with a direction couple Sx, Sy, how the absolute x, y position of the point to be constructed is to be adapted. Thereto two 9 bits binary up down counters 56, 57 are used which can be loaded with the starting position x 0 , y . The absolute position x, y can at any moment be read out from these up down counters and further be processed, used or memorized. Fig. 13 shows an other embodiment of the bit couple selection unit which is indicated by the reference 3 in fig. 9.The bit couple selection unit 18 according to this embodiment is able to perform the same operations as the bit couple selection unit 3 according to fig. 9 and 10 using a substantially lesser number of parts The bit couple selection unit 18 comprises a programmable logic unit 19 and a series of 8 bistable flip flops 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.A clock signal Z1 applied to an input 28 serves for controlling the unit 18. The principle of this circuit can best be presented by reference to the truth table according. to table II, in which the condition vector Q O0 07 results in forming of the output vector D Ri , R8 . The output vector equals the series bit couple sel ction signals SX 8 and the bit couple selection signal So is formed by the clock signal Zl d vided by two. It obviously appears from fig. 8B and table 1 that the bit couple 0 should be selected each two clock pulses. The truth table according to table II has been realized by means of the program present in the unit 19 and the flit slops 20 through 27. Table III shows in terms of a troaram the operations of the programmable logic unit 19. The truth table can be interpreted as follows, The sequence of the bit couple selection is invariable, as is presented in fig. 8B and table I. The selection of a certain bit couple i has effect that one and only one condition quantity, namely Q11 is changed i.e. from the value 1 to the value 0 or from the value 0 to the value 1 , so that the condition vector travels through a GraRy code sequence. As is well known, this Gray code is defined as a code in which during the counting never more than one bit at the time changes. It is to be noted that the bit couple S8 does not necessarily have to be fed back. For the realization it is sufficient to use the presented 8 bistable flip flop 20 through 27 and the programmable logic unit 19 having 8 inputs. 8 product terms and 8 outputs. The important advantage of this circuit in relation to the previous es odiment is that the rate with which straight lines can be generated is almost ten times as high using this circuit the frequency of the clock signal z1 can be raised up to 10 IHz. Fig. 14 shows the extension of the straight lines generator as discussed to form a curves generator. Analogous to the circuit according to fig. 9 in the circuit according to fig. 14 three units can be discriminated a checking unit 29, a data unit 30 and an input output 31. The checking unit 29 consists of a module 32 comprising 8 bistable flip flops and a programmable logic unit 33. The outputs of the flip flop module 32 are connected with a number of the inputs of the programmable logic unit 33. The outputs of the unit 33 deliver bit couple selection signals S. which at the one side select the wanted bit couples, in the same way as according to fig. 11, and which at the other side deliver the control signals from the flip flop module 32 compare figure 13 .

This second set of inputs forming an extension relative to the straight lines generator discussed earlier effect that the regular sequence of the bit couples selection, as it occured during the generation of straight lines see e.g. figure 8B ans table I , is interrupted and reset in time. This interrupting and resetting of the normal sequence has to occur at each moment the previously selected bit couples have changed up to that rolling point that corresponds with an unchanged bit couple, as has been discussed before. Referring to the truth table in table II it can be verified , which new condition vector is associated with a corresponding unchanged bit couple. Fig. 15 shows a more detailed schematic diagram of the checking unit 29. The attention is drawn to the analogy with the circuit according to fig. 13. The programmable logic unit 33 not only comprises the inputs Oo connected with the flip flop module 32, but also 9 additional inputs C0 y C7 and 34, and, apart from the outputs R1 R8 an additional output Lo The interrupting and the resetting in time of the sequence of the bit couple selection then always takes place during the time interval, in which the bit couple 0 is selected.It is further to be noted that the bit couple signal So is not dependent upon an output signal of the programmable unit,33 but exclusively of the clock pulse signal zl, devided by 2, namely which also is applied to said output 34. The other bit couple selection signals are during said interval disabled by NAND gates 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, as now several outputs of the programmable logic unit 33 in correspondance with the bitcouple select con signals can be activated.

Particular features of the unit 33 are 9 outputs, 17 inputs, 4 product terms. Now follows a discussion of the data unit 30 forming part of the curves generator according to fig. 14. This unit 30 comprises a Dx register 43 and a Dy register 44 of which the nine bit couples with controllable buffers can be selected and transmitted to the input output 31 drawn in detail in fig. 11, Further a comparator module 34 is present serving for generating the important input variables C C7 for the 0 programmable unit 33. The schematic diagram of this comparatormodule 34 is drawn in detail in fig. 16. This comparator module 34 serves for comparing the bit couples from the registers 43 and 44 with the respective bit couples from two numbers F x,y,z, and G x,y,z, which will be discussed in more detail with reference to the explanation of the input output unit 31.Only the 8 most significant bit couples of Dx, Dy and F x,y,z, , x,y,z, are compared and give raise to the forming of a vector C consisting of the signals Co C7. A signal C. O 0 if Dxi Fi and simultaneously i iD Ci a signal C. 1, if Dxi K F. or Dy. Gi, For every 1 i 1 1 i from the value 0 through the value 7 this rule is embodied in the scheme according to fig. 16 with two exclusive OR gates and one OR gate, which in the fig. are not specified. Also the attention is drawn to the fact that the mentioned Dx and Dy registers 43, 44 can be loaded with w x,y,z, and G x,y1z, respectively, not only at the beginning of a generation cycle but now also during each clock period, namely on a moment after comparing the bit couples Dxi, Dy. and F., Ci Now a discussion follows of the input output unit 31This unit comprises to 9 bits up downcounters 45, 46 which score the absolute x y values, as is the case in the circuit according to fig. 12. Control signals are at one hand formed by the selected bit couple and at the other hand by the direction couple. The up down counters 46, 47 are obviously also loadable with a initial position x 0 , y by means of the inputs 47, 48, respectively. At any moment the absolute position x ,y can be delivered through the x output 49 and the y output 50. Through these outputs 49, 50 the absolute x, y position is, together with a third value, memorized in a z register 51, loadable through a loading input 52, applied to a calculating unit 53, which is adapted to transform the number x, y and z each comprising 9 bits to two numbers of 9 bits F x,y,z, and G x,y,z, , which are available on the lines indicated with 54, 55. The function to be performed by the calculating unit 53 can be adjusted through control inputs 56.These functions can be e.g. EMI24.1 F x ,y, z z G x,y,z x or F x,y,z xG x,y,z y It is in this respect recalled that the general form of the difference equation is Dx FkX,v Z Dy G x,y,z In the most frequently occurring practical cases the calculating unit 53 transfor s. information from the registers x,y,z to the registers F, E. The z register 51 forms the connection with other simular modules in solving difference equations of higher orders. For the calculation of arbitrary functions F x,y,z and G x7y,z also a similar module can be provided. The input output unit 31 further comprises an interpretation nodule 89 in which a bit couple applied to two inputs 90, 91 is combined with a dlrection couple ann lIed through two inputs 92, 93 to form control signals for the up down counter 45, 4. Fig. 18 shows a schematic diagram of a universal curves generator. Three main blocks 101, 102, 103 can be distinguished. The first part 101 serves for controlling and contains condition counters 104 and the priortylogic 105. The second part 102 of the data part contains the differential registers DX, DY, DZ ... 106 and the bits groupselectors 107. The third part 103 serves for input output, namely the programming of the differential relations 108 F,G,H. ... and the solutioncounters 109 X, Y, Z, ...The whole system is synchronously clocked. The processor is controlled by a typically sequential machine having memory elements and combinatorial logics, external inputs and external outputs. The new condition a is determined by the old condition b ,the old differential registers DX, DY, DZ... c and the differential relations F, G, H, ... d .Each moment a new rolling point is being selected, DX,DY, DZ, ... are being evaluated by F, G, H,The priority logics generate the index i of the bits group e to be selected. In order to obtain a generation by rolling off of the curve, the fitting bits groups f are fed into the binary counters X, Y, Z, ... which are clocked into that direction, that is determined by SX, SY, sz, . . . g After each clock cycle a new point of the curve is formed in the counters X, Y, Z, .. h . These counters by the way are loadable with the initial conditions j The differential relations are programmed by means of function keys ski. A prototype of the present processor is developed.It is a curves generator including three differentialrelations and consists of about 40 SSI and MSI TTL IC s no arithmetic modules . As a arafical processor the 6 mcçlle aenezates 2,5 x 10 points per second a new X,Y,Z, each 400 ns which is directly written into a video memory and read out to be presented on aTV monitor. Reference is now made to the figures 19 and 20, and 21 or a discussion of a transformationsystem according to the invention. A three dimensional points grid X,Y,Z is taken as a base, the coordinates of said grid being the integers running from 0 through N. A curve in said points grid can be described by elementary displacement bits DXi, DYi, DZi and direction bits SX, SY, SZ .The displacement bits indicate, whether the curve displaces according to the related coordinate axis in the direction indicated by the direction bits. This elementary displacemnets can e.g. correspond with the output signals of the system described in the foregoing, for generating digital signals eorresponding to selectable functions or function generator1 . They also can be directly based an other relative code relative i.e. from point to point of a curve or a contour e.g. Freeman code Slathematically a transformation of the present type can be formulated in terms of matrix multiplication, in which from a starting vector X0, Y0, Z0 by multiplication with a transformationmatrix a transformed vector Xnr Ynt Zn is determined EMI26.1 For instance for a certain two dimensional dilatation transformation the following relation holds EMI27.1 For a neighbour point can be written similarly EMI27.2 from which immediately the relation for the new displace ments dXi, dYi1 dZ. follows EMI27.3 As DXi, DYi, DZ. can only have the values 0 or 1 it is clear the the new displacements can only be accumulations 2x3 of the matrix elements aij and that the 64 2 , in which tlie number 3 corresponds with the dimension of the space involved possible configurations is determined by at one side SX, SY, SZ and at the other side DXi, DY., DZ. Thus according to the invention it is possible to avoid the nine multiplications, which are normally necessary, through ordinary accumulations. Further no systematic errors can occur. Thus a closed contour remains closed, even after transformation. Fig. 19 shows and E and 0, respectively, as to examples of letter symbols which can in a word processor be described with a single contour and a combination of an inner contour and an outer contour, respectively, Fig. 20a shows a square as an example of an ori ginal curve to be transformed by the transformationsystem according to the invention. The figures 20b through 20d are drawn on the same scale. It will, therefore, be clear, that the figures 20b, 20c, 20d respectively, correspond with a transformation consisting from a rescaling, a dilatation a rescaling combined with rotation, respectively, in which the several rescalings differ for the two independent directions. Fig. 21 shows a very simplified block schematic diagram of system according to the invention. This system comprises a memory block 110, the inputs of which are connected with the inputs of a block of adding registers 111. The addresses for the memory block 110 are fed thereto through address inputs 112 and consist of the displacement bits DXi, DY., DZ. and the direction bitsSX, SY, SZ. The below table shows the 64 data words having orders 0 through 63, which are stored in 64 memory Positions of the memory block together with the 64 potential addresses in the form of the potential combinations of the direction bits.It will be appreciated that each addressword is uniqually related with one data word and that the 64 data words comprise all possibilities. The read out new displaceme ts Ir n th.e form of the data dXi, dYi, dZi are continiously accumulated by the adding. registers 111. The carry bits DXj, DZ. 3 generated thereby form the new elementary displacement bits. It will be offlear c o that also the direction bits for these new disnlacments originate from the T rrc block 110.
