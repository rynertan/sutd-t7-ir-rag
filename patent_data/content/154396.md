# Method of processing seismic data.

## Abstract
A method for developing a novel seismic data attribute that enables improvements in seismic data processing and interpretation. Seismic signals or trace data are first rectified and then Hilbert transformed and processed with the arc tangent function to develop a new instantaneous phase parameter referred to as phase of rectified trace PORT .
