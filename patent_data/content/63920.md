# Material for drying cut plants and apparatus for facilitating such drying.

## Abstract
The material includes a drying agent with a pH of at least 11 and which becomes at least partially insoluble at a pH below 13.4. The drying agent saponifies the wax on the stems as the plant dries and as the pH of the drying agent accordingly increases. The drying agent is selected from the carbonates, phosphates and silicates of sodium and potassium and a combination of the hydroxides, carbonates and bicarbonates of sodium and potassium. It is applied at 3 to 6 pounds per ton of dried cut plant. The material also includes a mold inhibiting agent which remains inactive until the occurrence of conditions of temperaure and moisture inducing molding, whereupon it reacts with the moisture to inhibit the formation of the mold. The mold inhibiting agent may be selected from acids and acid salts of propionic, sorbic and carboxylic acids and other fatty acids and used in concentration between approximately 21 2 and 5 pounds per ton of dried cut plants. The material is applied to plants 16 by bending the plants with bars 12 and 18 to facilitate spraying by nozzles 22. After cutting by blade 26 the plants are assembled into windrows 30 by auger 28. The apparatus may include separate nozzles for spraying the leaves primarily with mold inhibiting agent and the stems primarily with drying agent and means for controlling the rate of spraying in accordance with the mass of the plants as determined by sensors on the bending bars.
