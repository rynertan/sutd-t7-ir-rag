# Control unit for starting operation of a conditioning equipment which is effective to influence the temperature in a building.

## Abstract
In a control unit for starting a climatization procedure in a building to create agreeable climatic conditions at a pre determined time, an equivalent electric circuit 27 is used to imitate the thermal properties of the building. A temperature sensing means 24 is provided within the interior of one or more of the intermediate walls of the building, said sensor 24 influencing the equivalent electric circuit 27 so that a reduced climatization effect will exist also after the air inside of the building has got the desired climatic properties, until the sensor indicates, that also the climatic conditions inside of the said wall or walls differs from the climatic conditions inside of the building by a pre determined small amount.
