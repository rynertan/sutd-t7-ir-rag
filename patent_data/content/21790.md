# Vertical axis windmills and turbines.

## Abstract
In a vertical axis windmill, pivoted blades 1 are interconnected through links 6 connected to a central displaceable junction 7 so that a change in pitch of one blade affects the pitch of other blades. Movement of the junction is controlled by means 8 tending to return it towards the axis of the windmill. The efficiency of blade type windmills may also be improved by augmenting aerodynamic surfaces arranged at or near the ends of the blades.

## Description
VERTICAL AXIS WINDMILLS AND TURBINES This invention relates to improved methods of construction of vertical axis windmills in which the pitch of the blades is varied by the force of the wind. It is also applicable to any turbine, whether working in air or another fluid, provided the general configuration is similar to that of a windmill in which the axis of rotation is vertical and substantially at right angles to the direction of flow of the fluid. French Patent specification No.530231 describes a vertical axis windmill in which the pitch of the blades is varied by the force of the wind. According to that specification, the variation in the pitch of each blade is controlled independently of the others by a spring connecting a stub arm on the blade to the hub of the rotor.With tis arrangement, the spring is extended as the pitch angle of the blade departs from zero under the pressure of id on the blade arid, nonsequently, it provides a restraining counter force. Each blade is also provided with a mass balance to counter the effect of centrifugal force on the blade. 7 I have discored that the efficiency of such windinills and similar turbines can be improved. . f In one form of the inVention, the efficiency of a vertical axis winmill or turbine having a rotor carrying a plurality of pivotted blades the pitch of which can be varied by the force of the wind or other working fluid is improved when the blades are interconnected by means of links radiating from a central junction which is displaceable through a controlled range from the axis of the rotor, the outer end of each link being pivotally connected to a blade at a point, the same for each blade, which is offset from the pivot axis of the blade, so that a change in pitch of one blade displaces the junction end consequently affects the pitch of the other blades. The links may take the form of rods or wires radiating from a junction on or near the axis of rotation of the windmill. The position of the junction is not fixed but its movement is controlled by a spring or other controlling device as later described. As the windmill rotates, all the blades will normally tend to pivot on their individual axes under the influence of centrifugal force but by the interlinking of the individual blades, independent pivoting is prevented.In effect the blades all act as mutual counterweights for each other. In this way the need for a mass counter balance on each blade, and the consequent increase in weight of the rotating parts of the windmill, is avoided. A further advantage is that the pivot points for the blades need not coincide with the centre line of the section of the blades, since the tendency for aero dynamic drag to cause unwanted components of force tending to pivot the blades will be neutralised by the interline this means that the blades can be made stronger since the pivot bearings can be external if required. A further advantage is that the instantaneous pitch angles of all the blades are inter dependent, so there is an averaging effect which will tend to overcome any tendency to oscillation or other undesirable movements such as are sometimes found in machines with individual pitch controls for each blade. However, the use of the interconnecting links described in this specification is not incompatible with additional individual pitch controls and counterweights, and it may be desirable for some applications to use a combined system. In my constructions pivoting diie to thn force of the wind can still occur because all blades wil experience a force due to the wind in substantially the same direction, i.e. dowmsind, as a conscquence vf wllich the junction of the links will be displaccd in tlle down wind direction to an extent determined by the wind speed and by the control device. In eteady.wind conditions the junction will remain approximatcly stationary nt a point downwind of the axis of rotation, and eaeli blade will experience a cyclic variation of pitch as the windmill rotates.Individual control springs or other control devices for each blade are thus no longer necessary. The controlling effect of the system of links on the pitch of the blades will be rather similar to that of a cam or eccentric such as has previously been proposed in other machines but the interlink has the advantage that the whole assembly rotates as one. The principle of operation is also different from those machines in that the force causing the blades to pivot is directly due ta the wind. A further advantage of the interlinked blades is that the wind vane used in the other machines to orientate the cam or eccentric relative to the direction of the wind is not required. The invention may be further understood by reference to Figures 1 to 5 of the accompanying drawings which show Fig. 1 a part plan view of one embodiment of the invention Fig. 2 a part vertical view of the windmill shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 a plan view of the windmill showing the blades in the deflected condition and Figs. 4 and 5 alternative types of control device for the junction. Figures 1 and 2 show by way of example a plan view of part of a windmill in which a blade 1 is connected by means of pivot 2 to supporting arm 3 which radiates from a central rotor shaft 4 . The centre line of the shaft 4 of the rotor is the axis of rotation of the windmill. The blade 1 is also connected by means of a pivot 5 to a link 6 which is joined to all the other links at a junction 7 . The position of the junction relative to the axis of the rotor is controlled by a spring 8 in the form cf a vertical flexible red connected between the shaft and junction 7 . In Figures 1 and 2 the blade is shown in the undeflected, or zero pitch position. Figure 3 shows in plan a rotor of a windmill carrying three blades 1 and three links 6 , the lattcr being interlinked at junction 7 , the blades are being deflected by the wind, the direction of the wind being indicated by an arrow 9 .All blades have their trailing edges deflected downwind, with the result that the junction 7 is displaced downwind of the axis of rotation as shown, te an extent controlled by the strength of the sprIng 8 . As the windmill rotates the position of the junction will remain approximately constant, and as the rotor turns the variation of pitch angle with angular position for each blade of the windmill will be approximately sinusoidal.The small angular Ilexure of the links at the junction can be aceommouated by making the links flexible, or by providing bearings or pivots at the inner end of each link Figure 4 illustrates an alternative means of corolling the displacement of the junction 7 in which the flexible rod 8 of Figure 2 is replaced b an arrangement of three springs 10 each of which is connected at the inner end to the junction 7 ard at the outcr end to one of the arms 3 of the rotor. The springs may be replaced by other means, e.g. rubber, pneumatic cylinders or pivoted counterl.7eight. In the embodiment shown in Figure 5, the displacement of the junction 7 is limited by a ring 11 mounted on the arms 3 concentrically with the axis of rotation of shaft 4 and inside which a dowmJard projection from junction 7 engages. In an alternative arrangement the ring maybe mounted on the junction in a plane normal to the axis of the rotor, displacement of the junction being limited by an axial projection on the rotor engaging within the ring. In general, the junction position can be determined by a restraining force or means, optionally in combination with a damping force or means. Damping may involve sliding friction between surfaces, or hydraulic or pneumatic devices involving flow of a fluid through a restricted aperture. In another embodiment of the invention, the links incorporate a protective device against overspeeding of the windmill, e.g. a device which, in excess of a predetermined speed, and consequently of a predetermined centrifugal force on the links, permits the links to extend and so allow further pivoting of all te blades. In this way, tho driving force of the wind is reduced and the drag of tfe blades is increased so restraining the speed of revolution of the windmill.Such a device may be, for example, a preloaded spring incorporated in each of the links which can then extend when a predetermined contrifugal loading is reached. he efficiency of a vertical windmill or turbine may also be improved by adding at each end of the blade an inclined aerodynamic surface. These aerodynamic surfaces are inclined to the plane normal to the axis of tlne blade, as explained below, in such a way as to increase the rate of mass flow through the windmill, or correspondingly orientated surfaces in the case of, a turbine. These added aeredynamic surfaces, hereafter termed augmenters, will normally be at or near the upper and lower ends of the blades of the vertical windmill or turbine. In the tangential plane of a windmill, which is defined here as a vertical plane which touches the cylindrical surface traced out by a blade during the course of its rotation about the vertical axis, the augmenters wiil be inclined with their leading edges towards one another, i.e. the upper one will have its leading edge inclined downwards and the lower one will have its leading dge inclined upwards. In the radial plane, which is defined here as a vertical plane containing the axs of rotation and cutting one of the windmill blades, the augmenters on that blade will be inclined with their outermost edges towards one another, i e. the upper one will slope downwards away from the axis of rotation and the lower one will slope upwards away frcm the axis of rotation. Although these four directions of inclination appear at first sight to be pushing air away from the windmill, they are in fact the directions required for increase of mass flow. Corresponding augmenters may also be used with any turbine in which the configuration dissimilar to a vertical axis windmill, i.e. where the direction of flow of the fluid is substantially at right angles to the axis of rotation. The primary advantage of augmenters is to increase the power output from a machine of given size, by virtue of the increased rate of mass flow of the fluid ,through the rotor. A second advantage is their property of controlling the tip vortices formed at the ends of the blades, in order to modify the characteristics of the windmill as may be desired. A third advantage is the tendency of the augmenters to diminish the bending moments in the blades, thus improving the resistance of, the windmill to accidental breakage. This aspect of the invention may be further understood by reference to Figures 6 to 11. Of these, Figures 6 to 9 illustiate the incliation, in one of the planes reterred to above, cf augmenters.of three different types. In these figures, a blade is indicated as Before by 1 , and an augmenter by 12 . Figures 6 to 8 show the angle of inclination in the radial plane for three cases in each ease the axis of rotation is indicated by 13 . In Figure 6 the blade 1 is of the straight variety, and may be either fixed pitch or variable pitch. In Figure 7 the blade 1 is of the Darrieus or troposkien type. In Figure 8 the supporting arms 3 for the blades are themselves so shaped and positioned as to function as augmenters. Figure 9 shows the direction of inclination of the augmenters 12 in the tangential plane, with the direction of movement of the blade indicated by 14 .Figures 10 and 11 show two possible shapes for the agumenters. In Figure 10 the augmenter 12 resembles a conventional tip vane with the addition of the two angles of inclination as described above this will give a greater degree of control of the tip vortex and may be the best mode for the case where it is required to modify such characteristics as, for example, the shape of the curve relating power output with the ratio of blade speed to wind speed. In Figure 11 the augmenter 12 resembles a wing of high aspect ratio this will give a high ratio of lift to drag in the augmenter itself, but less control of the tip vortex, and it may be the best mode ere it is required to maximise power output regardless of other characteristics. The angle of inclination of the augmenter in the tangential plane as described above should be between 0 50 and 15 , preferably about 100. The angle of inclination in the radial plane as described above should be between 30Q and 600, preferably between 400 and 500. Multiple augmenters, and other shapes oS augmenter are also possible within the scope of this invention
