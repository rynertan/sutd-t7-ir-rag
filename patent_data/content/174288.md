## Description
This invention relates to an apparatus for use in the alignment of rotating equipment, for example two spindles which are to be brought into axial alignment with each other, of the type disclosed in the preamble to the subsequent, independent claim 1.The alignment of rotating equipment is a well known concept within that part of the industry which uses this type of equipment. The problem has all the time been to find a satisfactory tool for the attachment of dial indicators or, more recently, feelers, so that the measurements can be carried out on the rotating equipment for the control and possible alianment of this.Usually a special holding tool has been made for each coupling diameter and each type of coupling, connecting two rotating spindles or other rotating equipment. This work has in many cases been more time consuming that the alignment itself.Nearly all the various types of equipment for said use. found on the market and utilized in the industry are, in practice, applicable to a very limited area, most often because of too large building measurements and difficult installation.The object of the present invention is to achieve an apparatus or a holding tool for the purpose stated above, said apparatus being applicable to all ordinary coupling for rotating equipment, irrespective of the diameter or shape of the coupling.One does not, however, consider special couplings, such as, for example, claw couplings, which must be aligned in a very special way, but these are usually in a minority in ordinary industry.The apparatus or holding tool according to the invention is small and light and very timesaving. All factories with maintenance departments which today perform their own installations and maintenance work are capable of using the equipment according to the invention, said equipment being applicable to a greater area that that which already is ontbe market.The above purpose is, according to the invention, achieved by means of the features disclosed in the characterizing clause of the subsequent independent claim 1 and in the subsequent dependent claims.The invention will be further described below, with reference to an embodiment shown in the drawing,wherein Figure 1 shows the apparatus for use in the alignment of rotating equipment viewed in perspective and in a partly dismounted state,Figure 2 shows the apparatus in perspective in a position ready for use on a coupling for connecting two spindles, said couplong bei ncT of the flange type, andFigure 3 shows the same as Figure 2, but with the feelers placed against the flangeless part of the coupling.The apparatus for use in the alignment of rotating equipment, for example two spindles A,B which are to be brought into axial alignment with each other, comprises a holding head l with fastening means 2 in the form of a chain for detachable, peripheral attachment to one coupling section AK in a coupling comprising two coupling sections AK and BK, placed each on its own spindle A,B and held together by means of coupling bolts Kl. The chain 2 lies peripherally strapped around the circular cylinder area of the coupling section AK and is with one end 2a fastened to one side la of the holding head 1 and with its other end 2b to a tightening means 2c comprising a stretching screw 2d at the opposite side lb of the holding head 1.The end of the stretching screw 2d is non rotatably connected with the end 2g of the chain 2, and runs freely through a bore lg of one side lb of the holder head 1, engaging with a nut lh, positioned to move freely against the limiting edge of the bore in side lb. The end 2a of the chain 2 is adjustably attached to the holding head 1 in that the chain runs through an aperture li in side la of the holding head 1 with a locking screw lj for locking enmeshment with the links of the chain 2. The chain can thus by placement around a coupling section AK or BK or a spindle A or B be preliminarily adjusted for fitting the actual diameter, in that it is pulled through the aperture li and thereafter fastened by means of the locking screw lj.Finally, the chain 2 can be tightened by means of the stretching screw 2d and the nut lh, so that the holding head 1 rests in a firm position against the coupling section or the spindle. In order to achieve a firm rest against spindles or coupling sections with different diameters, that side of the holding head 1 which rests against the spindle or coupling section is supplied with two ridges le,lf, spaced apart and running parallel to the central axis of the spindle or coupling section on which the holding head 1 is mounted.Parallel to said ridges le, lf, the holding head 1 has a fastening rod 3, mounted so as to be movable in a bore lc in the holding head 1 and having a longitudinal track 3c for engagementwitha locking screw Id, protruding into the boreIc. The fastening rod 3 is thereby movable lengthwise but not rotatable. The fastening rod 3 has a bore 3a with a lock ing screw 38 for mounting a feeler or dial indicator RF which can be moved in the bore and be locked by means of the locking screw 3b, thereby being brought into radial contact with the periphery of the other spindle or coupling section.The fastening rod 3 has at one end an adjustable fastening slide 4, which forms a right angle with the fastening rod 3 and is radially directed toward the coupling section or spindle in that a longitudinal slit 4c in the fastening slide engages with an axial projection 3d at the end of the fastening rod 3, which is supplied with a locking screw 3f for the fastening slide 4. The fastening slide 4 has at its end a bore 4a with a locking screw 4b for adjustable fastening of a feeler or a dial indicator AF, positioned in the bore. Said feeler dial indicator AF is axially adjustable in relation to the coupling section or spindle on which the holding head 1 is placed for adjustment of axial contact with an area at right angles with the other spindle, B in Figure 1, for example the side area of the coupling section BK. When the apparatus, as shown in Figure 1, is mounted on the coupling section AK of the spindle A by means of the chain 2 and with the feelers dial indicators RF and AF in contact with respectively the cylindrical circumference area and the coupling section s BK side area to this, said feelers dial indicators RF,AF can now be set, whereafter the two spindles A, B with coupling sections AK, BK are turned in order to determine, by means of the apparatus, the position of the spindles A, B in relation to each other, viz, whether the spindles are in alignnent with each other or are located somewhat obliquely in relation to each other.The feelers RF, AF, which through the wires L1, L2 are connected with a registration instrument I, will, when the spindles A, B and the coupling sections AK, BK have been turned one revolution, sense whether there are radial or axial movements between the point on one coupling section AK to which the holding head 1 is strapped and the two points on the other coupling section BK against which the feelers RF and AF rest. The extent of the movements is registered on the instrument I and can be used as a guide for aligning the rotating equipment. The alignment itself takes place in a manner known per se, in that one of the spindles, for example the spindle B, is aligned through thin intermediate discs being placed between the component to which the shaft B belongs and the component s attachment to a frame, a process which will not be further described here. Through the use of dial indicators instead of said feelers, the dial indicators fluctuations from zero position for respectively radial and axial movement will be taken as a guide for placing intermediate discs for aligning one spindle B in relation to the other spindle A. The fastening rods 3 and the fastening slides 4 can be available in sets of various lengths, so that the feelers dial indicators RF, AF can be brought up to any cylindrical area or side area of the other spindle B, and feelers dial indicators of various lengths can also be used in order to facilitate adjustment of the contact with the specific areas. With these components of various lengths, the apparatus according to the invention can easily be mounted on any rotating equipment and the feelers dial indicators be brought to rest against the specific areas through a selection of an appropriate length of respectively fastening rod 3, fastening slide 4 and the feelers dial indicators cylindrical portions which are adjustably strapped through the bores 3a and 4a of the fastening rod 3 and the fastening slide 4 respectively.
