# A METHOD AND AN APPARATUS FOR CLIMATIC REGULATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE POLLINATION OF HOTHOUSE PLANTS

## Abstract
In order to improve the yield of seeds and fruits from plants in a greenhouse it is suggested that the climatic conditions during the flowering of the plants is controlled in such a manner that the flowers are pollinated effectively. In a greenhouse, where it is possible to measure and regulate the temperature T and the atmospheric moisture LF , it is therefore suggested that the intensity SL of the sunlight incident in the greenhouse is measured and integrated to obtain a measure I for the accumulated sunlight energy, and that the atmospheric moisture LF in the greenhouse is measured and that the atmospheric moisture LF by regula tion is decreased concurrently with the increasing accumu lated sunlight energy E , until the accumulated sunlight energy exceeds a predetermined threshold value EA , and until the atmospheric moisture LF has been regulated down to or below a second predetermined threshold value LFB , whereafter the atmospheric moisture is kept at or below this low value for a certain period, during which pollination is effected. After finishing the pollination the atmospheric moisture LF should be increased considerably until the moisture content exceeds a predetermined threshold value LFC to be maintained for a certain period of time. A climatic control system for use in the method compris es a temperature sensor T , a sunlight sensor SL and an atmospheric moisture sensor LF , which via an A D conver ter 18 is connected to a microcomputer 19 which on its output is connected by means of relays to the irrigation means 21 , heating means 22 and ventilation 23 .
