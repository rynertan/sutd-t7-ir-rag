# A resting device for two wheel vehicles.

## Abstract
The device comprises a support 1 fastened to the frame of the vehicle, to which is articulated, by means of a pivot, a rod 3 that is movable between two extreme positions, that is to say, between a first, horizontal, extreme position of minimum volume and a second, vertical, extreme vehicle resting position, and vice versa. Elastic means 7 with which the device is provided, exert an effect on the said rod 3 and on a rocker element 8 that oscillates along an axis 9 parallel to the axis of the said pivot. When the rod 3 is in the said second position, the element 8 intercepts, under the action of the said elastic means 7 , a locator member 10 integral with the rod 3 and, in this way, the said second position is stabilized. The operation of an unlocking lever 12 that is integral with the rocker element 8 and is outside the said support 1 , causes the rocker element 8 to be released from the rod 3 which, under the action of the said elastic means 7 , moves into the said first position.

## Description
A resting device for two wheel vehiclesAs is knovin, resting devices for two wheel vehicles, particularly bicycles and motorcycles, commonly called stands , consist essentially of a support that can be fastened to the frame of the vehicle in an integral fashion and sustains, by means of a pivot, a long rod.The said rod is movable from a first extreme position of minimum volume, in which it is kept almost horizontal at the side of the lower part of the frame of the vehicle, to a second extreme position for resting the vehicle, in which the said rod is virtually in a vertical position, slightly inclined towards the vehicle, and resting on the ground, in such a way as to constitute a reliable prop for the said vehicle. Certain problems arise with the said stands, the most significant being somewhat onerous assembly operations, on the part of the manufacturer, and the absolute necessity, on the part of the user, to use the upper part or side of one of his or her feet to lever up the said rod, each time it is wished to utilize the vehicle, in order to cause the said rod to return to its extreme position of minimum volume this inevitably compels the user to rest the upper part or side of the vamp of his or her shoe against the rod. The object of the invention is to overcome the aforementioned difficulties by creating a resting device for two wheel vehicles which, in addition to being particularly quick and easy to assemble, allows the user to bring about the return of the resting rod to its position of minimum volume in an easier way, through an external lever on which the sole of one of the shoes of the user can press dove without any difficulty. This object is achieved with the device forming the subject of the invention, of the type that comprises a support that can be fastened to the frame of the vehicle in an integral fashion and sustains, by means of a pivot, a long rod movable from a first, almost horizontal, extreme position of minimum volume, to 2 second, almost vertical, extreme position for resting the vehicle, the said resting device being characterized by the fact that it comprises elastic means that exert on the said long rod, a torque pointed in the direction that goes from the said second to the said first extreme position of minimum volume and that, contemporaneously, come into contact with a first extremity of a rocker element, pivoted to the said support, causing a couple that tends to maintain the second extremity of the said rocker element in contact with the peripheral part of the said rod placed in the region of the said pivot, there being along the said part a member for locating the second extremity of the said rocker element, so as to maintain the said rod stably in the said second extreme resting position and overcome the saic tora.ue to which the said rod is subjected, the said rocker element being provided with a tail piece that stretches towards the outside of the said support, commencing at the said pivot or first extremity, with which is integral an unlocking lever, operated from the outside through a top to bottom thrust, that counteracts the couple applied to the said rocker element and raises the said second extremity of the rocker element away from the said locator member, thus releasing the said rod which, from the said second position is aole to return to the said first position of minimum volume.Not only is the said unlocking lever noticeably simple from the point of view of construction and assembly but, with a simple top to bottom thrust, it releases the said rod which thus returns, in a far easier way for the user, to its pos ition of minimum volume.Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will become more obvious from the detailed description of the device that follows, illustrated on the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of the invention, in one of its two stable positions Figure 2 is a lateral view of the invention as depicted in the preceding figure, with certain parts removed in order that others may be seen better Figure 3 is a perspective view of the invention, in its other stable position Figure 4 is a plan view of the invention with certain minor modifications.With reference to the drawings listed above, the resting device in question comprises a support 1 that can be fastened, at 2 , to the frame of a two wheel vehicle in an integral fashion and sustains, by means of a pivot, a long rod 3 . More specifically, the rod 3 is able to rotate around a pin 4 carried transversely by a pair of opposite walls 5 and 6 of the support 1 . The rod 3 is movable from a first, almost horizontal, extreme position of minimum volume see Figure 3 , to a sec ond, almost vertical, extreme position for resting the vehicle see Figures 1, 2 and 4 . The resting device in question comprises, furthermore, elastic means, constituted by one single helical spring 7 wound around the pin 4 . One extremity 7a of the said spring 7 exerts an effect on the rod 3 and causes a torque pointed in the direction S that goes from the said second to the first extreme position of minimum volume.Contemporaneously, the other extremity 7b of the spring 7 exerts an effect on a first extremity fez of a rocker element 8 . The latter, pivoted at 9 to the said support, produces a couple which, in the case shoxffln in the figures, points in the opposite direction to S, namely the direction S1, and tends to maintain the second extremity 8b of the rocker element 8 in contact with the peripheral part 3a of the rod 3 placed in the region of the pin 4 . In, for example, the case in Figure 1, the part 3a is, in actual fact, divided into two virtually semicircular sections, each of which adjacent to one of the walls 5 and 6 of the support 1 .With this particular form of construction, each peripheral section 3a is provided with a locator member, in the case in question a tooth 10 , which serves to contrast the extremity 8b of the rocker element 8 , so as to maintain the rod 3 stably in the second extreme position, that is to say in its resting position, and to counteract the torque S to which the said rod 3 is subjected. The rocker element 8 is provided with a tail piece 11 that extends towards the outside of the support 1 and with which is integral an unlocking lever 12 operated from the outside through a top to bottom thrust in the direction of the arrow B. In this way, the operation of the lever 12 contrasts the couple S1 applied to the rocker element 8 , raises the extremity 8b thereof from the tooth 10 , and releases the rod 3 which is thus able to return from the second vertical position to the first position of minimum volume.With special reference to Figures 1, 2 and 3, the conformation of the rocker element 8 is, in plan view form, substantially a U , where the extremity 8a is constit uted by an arsa see Figures 1 and 3 formed on the stem that, in the case in question, extends along the pivoting axis 9 , while the other stem coincides, in practice, with the extremity 8b . The tail piece 11 is shaped in the form of an L upside down, as can clearly be seen in Fig ures 1 and 3.The stem coinciding with the extremity 8b protrudes transversely from the aforementioned walls 5 and 6 , through a pair of slots 14 and 15 , respectively, provided to allow the free ocillation of the extremity 8b from a first extreme lowered position, corresponding to the said first extreme position of minimum volume of the rod 3 , to a second extreme raised position adopted because of the operation of the unlocking lever 12 . The other stem, that is to say the one .coinciding with the pivoting axis 9 , protrudes from the wall 6 , through a corresponding slot 16 provided to allow the extremity 8a shaped, as stated previously, with an ansa to pass freely at the time of assembly. The said assembly operation is particularly simple since the rocker element is, in practice, inserted by its stems inside the aforementioned slots, and only subsequently is one extremity bent to constitute the tail piece 11 that is shaped in the form of an L upside down. In one slightly modified form of emboa ment for the device according to the invention, the rocker element 8 is lo cated right inside the support 1 , apart from the extreme ity thereof that constitutes the tail piece 11 see Figure 4 which, this time, is bent prior to insertion. In this case, the rocker element 8 is pivoted at 9 to the support 1 at an intermediate point in between the stems that define the extremities 8a and 8b . In the said case, as shown in Figure 4, the rod 3 is provided with a projection 17 that serves to locate the extremity 7a of the spring 7 , while the extremity 7b of the spring 7 exerts an effect on the extremity era of the rocker element in, for example, the region of a stall ansa 18 .Tote should be taken of the assembly simplicity in this case too, and in both cases, of the easy way in which the rod 3 is released by simply pressing dozen the lever 12 .
