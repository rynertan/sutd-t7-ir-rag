# Two crystal X ray spectrometer.

## Abstract
A two crystal X ray spectrometer in which hinged radius arms carry respective crystals 3, 4, at equal radii, and a spectrometer wavelength adjustment modifies the angular disposition of the source 1 and detector 5 about the corresponding crystal 3, 4, at half the hinge angle rate. Hitherto the crystals were mounted radially. The improvement consists of displacing the crystals 3, 4, through opposite angles to the radius line 7 , 11 , where lies in the range 50 to 70 degrees. This enables the glancing incidence angle Ï‘ to be adjusted from 0 to 75 degrees without obstruction of the beam due to the detector 5. To reduce the detector background due to scattered radiation, screening blades 70, 71, are moved pependicularly to the centre of the respective crystal surface just clear of the spectrometer beam. This enables the arrangement to be more compact than the prior use of Soller slits.
