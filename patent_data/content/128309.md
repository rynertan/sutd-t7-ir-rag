# An etchable electrophotographic long run printing plate and method of making same.

## Abstract
An etchable electrophotographic printing plate com prising a coating on a surface of an electroconductive sup port such as grained, anodized aluminum of effective amounts of photoconductive ZnO and of a sensitizing dye dispersed in an organic resin binder comprised of about 60 90 wt of C₂ C₄ alkenyl C₂ C₈ alkanoate, about 5 30 wt of di C₁ C₈ alkyl C₄ C₈ alkenedionate, about 2 8 wt of C₃ C₈ alkenoic acid or C₄ C₈ alkenedioic acid, and about 0.5 5.0 wt of a cross linking agent. The prefer red thermally cross linkable organic resin binder is a ran dom copolymer of 70 wt vinyl actate, 24 wt dibutyl ma leate 5 wt acrylic acid and 1 wt glycidyl methacrylate. The etchable printing plate of the present invention is envi ronmentally safe, has excellent shelf life and high sensitivity to actinic radiation. A process of image wise exposure of the etchable electrophotographic printing plate to a low power laser combined with an environmentally safe aqueous etch ant to prepare a printing plate that provided 100,000 good quality impressions is also disclosed.
