## Description
A two wa reversible flow hydraulic control valve.The invention relates to a two way control valve with reversible flow characteristic for use in hydraulic applications.Valves of the type to which the invention relates are very often solenoid operated. The solenoid impinges on a plunger within the valve, urging it into an open or closed position and permitting flow of the fluid in either direction through the valve as a result.Generally speaking, the opening and closing movements of such valves call for high power solenoids, since the hydraulic forces exerted on their plungers during operation are usually of a somewhat high order.It is an object of the invention to eliminate the above drawback, providing a hydraulic valve that can be operated utilizing solenoids of particularly low rated power.A first advantage of the valve described herein is that of providing faultless operation across generous ranges of pressure and flow, with decidedly low pressure losses.A further advantage of the valve is that of compact construction and dimensions.The stated object and advantages, and others besides, are realized with the valve to which the invention relates, which is of a type having a first obturator, or plunger, actuated to open or block the flow path between the two valve ports, and is characterised in that it comprises a first passage, provided with a first restriction and connecting the first port of the valve with a chamber the shape and location of which are such that fluid pressure therein impinges on the plunger and urges. it toward the closed position a first check valve located within the first passage such as to allow flow of the fluid from the first valve port to the chamber a second passage, provided with a second restriction and connecting the second port of the valve with the chamber a second check valve located within the second passage such as to allow flow of the fluid from the second valve port to the chamber an unloading facility which connects the chamber with the valve outlet and a second, externally operated obturator actuated to open or block the unloading facility.A preferred embodiment of the valve will now be described in detail, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing, which is a section seen in vertical elevation.The hydraulic valve to which the invention relates is a two way reversible flow control valve which serves substantially to allow or shut off flow of fluid from a first port A to a second port B, and viceversa to this end, the valve incorporates a first obturator, or plunger 1, which when operated opens or closes the flow path between the two ports A and B.The valve illustrated is of a general type in common use wherein the plunger 1 is invested frontally by a flow of fluid entering through the first port A, and invested radially by a flow of fluid entering through the second port B. The plunger 1 itself shifts within a body 2 that incorporates the two ports A and B.The rear end of the plunger 1 exhibits a section of larger area than that of its front end, for reasons which will become apparent in due course. The part of the valve body that accommodates the rear end of the plunger is provided with a chamber 9 it follows that fluid pressure existing within this chamber 9 will impinge on the plunger 1, urging it toward the closed position.The chamber 9 communicates with the first port A of the valve by way of a first passage 5, in which a restriction 5a is located. This first passage 5 also incorporates a first check valve 5b that admits flow intothe chamber 9 from the first port A, though not in the reverse direction.The chamber 9 communicates likewise with the second port B by way of a second passage 6, also provided with a restriction 6a, and similarly incorporating a check valve 6b that admits flow into the chamber 9 from the second port B, though not in the reverse direction.The valve also incorporates an unloading facility that connects the chamber 9 with the outlet, either directly or indirectly, and thus provides a controllable means whereby the chamber 9 can be relieved of pressure.In the example illustrated, the unloading facility comprises a third passage 7 connecting the chamber 9 with the first port A and provided with a third check valve 7a which allows flow from the chamber 9 to the first port A, though not in the reverse directionThe same unloading facility also comprises a fourth passage 8, connecting the chamber 9 with the second port B and provided similarly with a fourth check valve 8a which allows flow from the chamber 9 to the second port B, though not in the reverse direction.The third and fourth passages 7 and 8 have a common bore 11 extending toward the chamber 9 a second obturator, which in this instance is a needle 4 seated in the end of the bore 11 and operated externally by a solenoid 3, provides the control by which to open or close the unloading facility, that is, the third and fourth passages the common bore 11 of the two passages 7 and 8 terminates in an orifice the reduced diameter of which provides the needle 4 with a limited surface area against which to register.The four flow passages 5, 6, 7 and 8 and all of their respective internal components are incorporated into the plunger 1, thereby rendering the valve remarkably compact. It will be observed that, even were the unloading facility to be embodied as an external fluid line connected direct to the outlet, the design disclosed would still provide the notable advantage of dispensing altogether with drain lines, which are the cause of considerable problems and complications in hydraulic systems drain lines occasion loss of fluid under pressure, which in turn can provoke malfunction of the system into which the valve is connected. The following description of the valve s operation assumes entry of fluid under pressure via the first port, or inlet A, with the valve blocking or allowing flow across the valve from A to B.As long as the needle 4 registers in the orifice of the bore 11, blockingthe unloading passages 7 and 8, pressure transmitted from the inlet A up through the passage 5, check valve 5b and restriction 5a into the chamber 9, impinges on the rear end of the plunger 1 and urges it into the closed position, the area of the rear end being larger than that of the front end.Thus, with the needle 4 seated and the unloading facility unavailable, pressure in the chamber 9 matches inlet pressure at A, as flow from the chamber 9 via the second passage 6 to the second port B which is the outlet in. this case remains similarly blocked by the relative check valve 6b. Operation of the solenoid 3 causes the needle 4 to be distanced from the bore 11 that communicates with the two unloading passages 7 and 8, and pressure in the chamber 9 is exhausted via the fourth check valve 8 and through the outlet B the plunger 1 shifts under pressure of the fluid entering through the inlet A, and fluid is allowed to flow directly from A to B.It will be noted that, in the situation thus arrived at, a trickle of fluid will continue to flow through the first passage 5 pressure in the chamber 9 cannot approach inlet pressure through A however, as a sharp pressure drop occurs through the restriction 5a.With the needle 4 re seated by the solenoid 3, fluid pressure in the chamber 9 returns to that registering through the inlet A and urges the plunger 1 back into closed position.In the event of pressure flow entering via the port denoted B, and crossing the valve from B to A, operation of the valve clearly remains the same as already described, with the sole difference that those functions which were performed by the first passage 5 and its internal components will now be performed by the second passage 6 and the second internal components pressure in the chamber 9 is unloaded similarly by unseating the needle 4, though in this instance fluid will exhaust through the third check valve 7a instead of the fourth 8a. A valve thus described will operate faultlessly without being affected either by very low fluid pressures or by very high fluid pressures a valve according to the invention avoids the use of a spring bias which, imparting force to the plunger 1 that is independent of fluid pressure, can modify operation of the valve itself when pressure fluctuates.Also worthy of note is that the valve, whilst able to operate with extremely high flow rate and pressure characteristics, requires a markedly low power for energization of the solenoid 3, by virtue of the fact t hat the section of the needle 4 which the solenoid actuates is noticeably small. It follows therefore, that the size of the solenoid 3, and by definition, the overall dimensions of a solenoid operated embodiment of the valve, can be made singularly compact.
