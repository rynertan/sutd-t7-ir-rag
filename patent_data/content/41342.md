# IMPROVEMENTS IN SUSPENSION STRUTS FOR VEHICLES

## Abstract
A suspension strut of the mono tube type comprises a cylinder 1 of stepped outline having a portion 2 of greater diameter and a portion 3 of smaller diameter. A volume of gas or air adapted to support at least a part of the load on a wheel of a vehicle is accommodated in the portion 2 of greater diameter, and a piston 8 works in the cylinder 1 against hydraulic fluid in the cylinder 1 . The gas or air is separated from the fluid by a floating piston 13 , which can be omitted when the portion 2 is disposed at the upper end of the cylinder 1 .
