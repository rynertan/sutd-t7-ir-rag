# Magnetron sputtering cathode assembly and magnet assembly therefor.

## Abstract
A planar magnetron sputtering cathode assembly 10 especially for simultaneously heating and coating substrates is also adaptable to a cool substrate operation. The cathode assembly 10 features an efficient magnetic circuit using magnet assemblies 18, 20 enclosed within the sputtering chamber using minimal air gaps for magnetic efficiency and high strength magnets 58 to produce a high field at the sputtering target, and stainless steel cladding 50, 52 of the magnets 58 to protect the magnets as well as to prevent out gassing from the magnet material. A heat sink 24 fills the space between the magnets 55 to provide excellent cooling of the magnets 58 as well as cooling of the target 32 which seats directly on the heat sink 24 . The target 32 is held in place by bolts 40 to facilitate rapid target changing.
