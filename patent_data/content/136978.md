# HIGHLY CONCENTRATED SUPERSONIC MATERIAL FLAME SPRAY METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
Particulate material, which may be heat softened or liquified, or which may remain solid, is fed outside of an electrical heating zone 2 for electric arc heating under pressure a continuous flow of heated gas 7 , or outside of a combustion chamber 114 producing high pressure, high temperature products of combustion, axially into the con verging flow of the heated gas or products of combustion while entering a converging portion 121a of a flow expansion nozzle 41, 120 having a nozzle bore 41, 121 of a length that is at least five times the diameter of the nozzle bore. This restricts the diameter of the column of particles P passing through the nozzle bore to prevent build up of particle material on the nozzle bore, if molten or heat softened, while insuring sufficient dwell time within the bore to effect particle heat softening or melting, or if the particles are solid, to prevent abrasion of the nozzle bore wall by the particles while accelerating the particles to supersonic velocity.
