# Pellet durability tester.

## Abstract
A pellet durability tester is provided which establishes the durability of manufactured pellets by subjecting them to circulation in a closed air re circulation path and estalishing the weight ratio of whole pellets in the sample before and after testing. The tester comprises a cabinet 3 divided by an internal partition 7 into two compartments. One of these compartments, 6 constitutes part of the re circulation path. The pellets to be tested are introduced into the other compartment at its top and, in one embodiment, pass over a sieve 17 to remove lose material from the whole pellets so that only the whole pellets are deposited into a container 13 whose weight can be measured automatically. This contain er 13 tips the pellet sample into the compartment 6 for circulation around the re circulation path. The re circulation path also includes a swivel head 5 which can direct the re circulated air and material either into the compartment 6 or back to the sieve 17 so that the loose material is removed and the remaining whole pellets are received in the container 13 for weighing. In a further embodiment, the tester may include means for at least partly drying the pellet sample prior to weighing by blowing air over it.
