# Inflatable pouch.

## Abstract
A fluid impervious self inflatable sealed pouch 20 containing separately compartmented first and second gas generating components which, upon admixture in succes sive discrete quantities, generate gas, causing the pouch to expand gradually from an initial collapsed condition to an ultimately fully expanded condition. Within the pouch is a mechanically rupturable solvent containing member 43 , 33 optimally including a measured quantity of one of said components and the other said component is enclosed by a water soluble film barrier 41 of polyvinyl alcohol, methyl cellulose or the like, additional inner receptacles 29 within the pouch contain measured quantities of said one compo nent for successive release into said admixture caused by expansion of said pouch 20 . A method is provided whereby the pouches 20 are formed in a continuous manner from a plurality of film like materials 24, 41, 43, 46 fed to respective successive work stations at which receptacles and or containers are formed, components introduced, permanent and or releasable seals are formed, water soluble barriers provided and completed pouches delivered in finished form in interconnected and or severed, independent condition for further utilization.
