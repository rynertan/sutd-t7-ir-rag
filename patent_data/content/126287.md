## Description
Fluorinated compounds having analgesic and antiinflammatory activities The present invention refers to new fluorinated derivatives of acetic acid having formula IEMI1.1 wherein R may be an hydroxy, methoxy, ethoxy group or a chlorine atom and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said derivatives,particularly salts of al kali or alkali earth metals or salts with basic aminoacids such as lysine or arginine. The compounds of the invention are endowed with interesting and useful pharmacological properties, particularly analgesic and anti inflammatory activi ties which make them useful in therapy. Another as pect of the present invention is therefore constituted by pharmaceutical compositions containing as the active ingredient one or more compounds of for mula I or of their physiologically acceptable salts, optionally in combination with suitable excipients commonly used in pharmaceutical technique. The compounds of the invention proved to be less toxic and remarkably more active in comparison with other known antiinflammatory and analgesic agents, such as Naproxen and Diflunisal. The latter, recently and widely used in clinical medicine and described in U.S. Patent n.3.674.870, shares with the compounds of the invention the 2,4difluoro biphenyl group. Diflunisal, on the other hand, is a salicylic acid derivative and is therefore endowed with structural, chemicho physical characteristics and, presumably, a mechanism of action, completely different from the ones of the compounds of the present invention, whose activity should be therefore consi dered completely unexpected and surprising. The compounds of formula I can be conveniently prepared by reaction of 2,4 difluoro biphenyl with derivatives of oxalic or glyoxylic acids. Particularly, the monoethylester of glyoxylic acid chloride can be reacted with 2,4 difluorodiphenyl in the presence of Lewis acids after reduc tion of the dicarbonyl compound obtained and hydrolysis of the ester group, the 2 hydroxy 2 p 2 ,4 difluorophenyl phenyl7acetic acid Ia is ob tained, from which it is possible to obtain the other compounds object of the invention by displacement of the hydroxy group with known methods, according to the following scheme EMI3.1 The above scheme should not be considered in a li mitative way because it is plain that numerous changes can be carried out by experts in the art for in stance, compounds Ic and Id can be prepared by direct etherification of the ester of the acid Ia, different solvents, reagents and catalysts can be used to carry out some of the reported transformations, optionally also using phase transfer techniques. The pharmaceuti cally acceptable salts of compounds of formula I can be obtained by using conventional methods such as precipitation from solvents, crystallizations or lyophilization of aqueous solutions. The invention comprises the single enantiomers of compounds of formula I which can be obtained either by conventional optical resolution of the racemic mix ture or by asymmetric synthesis. The following non limiting examples further illustrate the invention without limiting in any way the scope thereof.EXAMPLE 1 2 Hydroxy 2 p 2 , 4 difluorophenyl phenyl7acetic acid Ia MR 864 a 32 Grams of A1C13 were suspended in 750 ml of 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane and 33 g of ethyloxalylchloride were added thereto, under strong stirring, keeping the temperature between 16 and 220C. A clear solution was obtained. A solution of 45.4 g of 2,4 difluorodiphenyl in carbontetrachloride was dropped in 5 6 hours, always keeping said temperature. The mixture was stirred for two additional hours and left overnight at room temperature. The reaction was followed by TLC dichloromethane as eluent . The mixture was then cooled to 0 C and slowly poured in water to destroy the red aluminium complex, without exceeding the temperature of 200C, with stirring. The phases were separated, washed with water to neutrality and dried on anhydrous Na2SO4. The solvent was evaporated and the residue distilled at 2000C. 42 Grams of yellow solid still slightly impu re were obtained 64.4 yield . bt The product of the above step a was dissolved in 500 ml of 950 alcohol, KBH4 was added in portions and the mixture was stirred for 4 hours. 10 M1 of acetic acid were added and the mixture was washed, dried and evaporated. A precipitate, which was discarded because consisting of the corresponding diole deriving from the reduction of the ester group, was obtained with ace tonitrile. The filtrate was evaporated and 38 g of a yellow solid were obtained. Yield 89.8 .c A yellow solid, soluble in water, cyclohexane and petroleum ether slightly soluble in toluene, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, was obtained by sa ponification with 10 KOH, acidification, filtration, drying, re crystallization from toluene.M.p. 173 1740C.TLC eluents chloroform, cyclohexane, acetic acid 5 4 1.EXAMPLE 2 2 Chloro 2 p 2 ,4 difluorophenyl phenyl acetic acid Ib MR 881 10 Grams of 2 hydroxy 2 p 2 ,4 difluorophe nyl phenyl acetic acid were suspended in 60 ml of anhydrous toluene. 7 M1 of SOCK2 were added to the suspension under magnetic stirring.
