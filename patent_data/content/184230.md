# Aircraft trailing edge flap apparatus.

## Abstract
An aircraft trailing edge flap assembly 32 including a main flap 36 and an aft flap 50 are repositioned by a dual arm rotary actuator 60 . One arm 130 of the rotary actuator repositions the main flap by driving a carriage assembly 100 along a linear track 66 . The other arm 136 of the rotary actuator repositions the aft flap 50 by driving a bell crank assembly which is operatively connected to an aft flap support member 90 extending downward from the aft flap 50 . The aft flap support member 90 is operatively connected to a main flap support member 92 which extends downwardly and rearwardly from the rear portion of the main flap 36 to operatively connect with a mounting member 70 extending downwardly and rearwardly from the track 66 so that the track mounting member 70 supports the majority of aerodynamic load forces applied to the flap assembly. Both arms of the rotary actuator rotate together through a predetermined arc so that the aft flap and main flap remain in a nested configuration. The main flap rotary arm 130 engages a stop pin resulting in the aft flap rotary arm 136 continuing to rotate the aft flip an additional amount relative to the main flap. The rotary actuator includes a cylindrical housing 160 , enclosing therein a cylindrical locking ring 162 integrally attached to the main flap rotary arm 130 , the locking ring including a plurality of radial passageways, each containing a locking ball 170 therein which projects outside the passageways either i to engage an arcuate recess 180 on the outer surface of a cylindrical aft flap locking ring 164 , the aft flap locking ring rotatably engaged within the main flap locking ring 162 , to couple the aft flap arm to the main flap arm, or ii to engage an arcuate recess 176 on the inner surface of the housing 160 to couple the main flap arm to the housing allowing the aft flap arm to rotate independently of the main arm. In another embodiment, the double arm rotary actuator is replaced by a single arm rotary actuator 200 having pivot connectors 208, 212 radially displaced relative to one another which connect to the carriage assembly and to the bell crank assembly respectively via connecting rods. The differential radial displacement of the pivot connectors results in a different radius of rotation therebetween which causes a faster rate of movement of the aft flap relative to the main flap.
