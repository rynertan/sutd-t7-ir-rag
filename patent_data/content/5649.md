# Water based coating compositions and coating processes using them.

## Abstract
A water based coating composition which emits very little pollutants on curing to a water resistant coating comprises a synthetic resin containing free carboxyl groups held in solution or stable dispersion in water by an amine. The amine is a tertiary carbinamine containing at least two hydroxymethyl groups bonded to the carbon atom carrying the amine group. The coating compositions react with formaldehyde to produce stable fluid emulsion coating compositions having similar properties on curing. The coating compositions are used to coat substrates.
