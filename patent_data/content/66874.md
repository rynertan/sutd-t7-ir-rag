## Description
COMPRESSOR DRIVE CONTROLLER The present invention relates to a compressor drive controller wherein a compressor driven by an engine through a belt is brought into engagement or disengagement with the engine by means of an electromagnetic clutch provided between the engine and the compressor.More particularly, the invention relates to a compressor drive controller wherein a compressor driven by an engine through a belt is disengaged from the engine by disactivating an electromagnetic clutch provided between the engine and the compressor when the compressor is locked. The prior art technologies for this purpose are as follows. 1 The rotational speeds of an input rotor of an electromagnetic clutch driven by an engine through a belt and an output rotor of the clutch coupled to the compressor are detected and compared. If the difference of both speeds exceeds a certain value, the electromagnetic clutch is deenergized so that the compressor is disactivated. This method is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 100430 80 published on July 31, 1980. In this method, however, if the compressor is locked while it is driven through a low tension belt, a slip will occur on the belt, causing the input and output rotors of the clutch to rotate at the same speed, creating no differential speed. Thus the clutch is not deenergized and the belt will be damaged, causing an adverse effect on operating the engine. 2 A thermal fuse connected in series to a winding of an electromagnetic clutch is provided in proximity of a friction disk of the clutch. If the compressor is locked, heat caused by a slip on the friction disk is sensed by the thermal fuse, so that the winding of the clutch is deenergized and the compressor is disactivated.This method is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,917,041 to Walbery issued on November 4, 1975. In this method, however, if the compressor is locked while it is driven through the low tension belt, the slip will occur on the belt, causing no slip on the friction disk. Therefore, the thermal fuse which is designed to operate in response to the heat on the friction disk does not cut off a current to the winding of the clutch. In addition to the foregoing prior art shortcoming, in a case where the input rotor of the electromagnetic clutch is arranged to drive engine accessories such as a power aided steering pump on a vehicle, cutting off of the belt which may occur as mentioned above will stop the rotation of the input of the clutch and, thus, will disactivate the poweraided steering pump, causing a sudden change in load of a handle during the running of a vehicle, which may lead to a serious accident. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a compressor drive controller which surely deenergizes the electromagnetic clutch when the compressor is locked. According to the present invention, the rotational speeds of the engine and the compressor are detected, and the compressor is disengaged from the engine if the ratio of both rotational speeds reaches the predetermined value. Since the compressor is connected to the output rotor of the clutch, the compressor speed is obtained by measuring the rotational speed of the output rotor of the clutch. The engine speed is detected in an engine side before a drive mechanism between the engine and the compressor.Therefore, the ratio of the compressor speed to the engine speed can be obtained reliably. The present invention will now be described by way of embodiment with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a cross sectional view of the compressor driver Figure 2 is a general systematic diagram of the compressor drive controller embodying the present invention Figure 3 is a block diagram showing a modified version of the control circuit shown in Fig. 2 Figure 4 is an illustration showing an embodiment of the engine speed detection means used in the compressor drive controller of the present invention and Figure 5 is an illustration showing another embodiment of the engine speed detection means. In Fig. 1, there is mounted on the side cover of a compressor 1 by a screw 2 a housing 4 which accomodates a winding 5 of an electromagnetic clutch 3. Supported by a bearing 6 on the interior wall of the housing is a rotor 7 which functions as an input rotor of the clutch, and is arranged to be driven by an engine 8 through a V belt not shown . The compressor 1 has a shaft 9 which extends outward through the interior space of the housing 4, and a hub 11 is mounted through a key 10 on the end of the shaft 9. A plate 12 is mounted on the hub 11, and a disk 14 is mounted on the plate 12 through a flat spring 13. The disk 14 confronts the end face of the rotor 7, and it comes in contact with the rotor 7 when the winding 5 is energized. The combination of the hub 11, plate 12, flat spring 13 and disk 14 functions as an output rotor 20 of the electromagnetic clutch 3.On one surface of the plate 12 there is provided an electromagnetic pickup 22 for detecting the rotational speed of the compressor. Figure 2 shows an embodiment of the compressor drive controller according to the present invention.The input rotor 7 of the electromagnetic clutch 3 is driven by the engine 24 through the belt 21. When the electromagnetic clutch 3 is energized, the input rotor 7 of the clutch 3 comes into contact with the output rotor 20 of the clutch which is connected directly to the shaft 9 of the compressor 26, and the compressor 26 is driven. In order to detect the rotational speed of the output rotor 20 of the clutch, i.e., the rotational speed of the compressor 26, there is provided a rotation detector 22 in proximity of the output rotor 20 of the clutch. The rotation detector 22 is connected through the waveform shaper 34 and the frequency voltage converter 36 to the voltage comparator 42 in the control circuit 30.On the other hand, in order to detect the rotational speed of the engine 24, the negative terminal of the ignition coil 28 is connected through the waveform shaper 38, the frequency voltage converter 40 and the resistor 41 to the voltage comparator 42. The output of the voltage comparator 42 is connected to the power transistor 44 in the clutch controller 32. The power transistor 44 is connected to the relay 46, which is connected to the battery 48. An air conditioner switch 50 is connected to the control circuit 30 so that the power transistor 44 is made conductive or non conductive. Next, the operation of the foregoing compressor drive controller will be described. The rotational speed of the compressor 26 is detected by the rotation detector made up of an electromagnetic pickup 22 and ferromagnetic bosses 23 in the form of a pulse signal having a frequency proportional to the rotational speed. The output of the pickup 22 is filtered by the waveform shaper 34, then converted by the F V converter 36 into a voltage signal proportional to the rotational speed of the compressor 26. Voltage pulses with the frequency proportional to the rotational speed of the engine 20 is obtained at the negative terminal of the ignition coil 28. This pulse signal is fed through the waveform shaper 38 and F V converter 40, and a voltage signal proportional to the engine speed is obtained at the output of the F V converter 40.The voltage signal from the F V converter 40 is fed through the resistor 41 to an inverting input of the comparator 42, which has a non inverting input terminal connected to the output of the F V converter 36. The resistor 41 has been chosen such that the difference of the pulley diameters for the engine 24 and compressor 26 is compensated and at the same time the comparator 42 provides a high level when the compressor is operated normally. Accordingly, during the normal operation of the compressor 26, the power transistor 44 is conductive to energize the relay 46, and the battery 48 is connected through a contact of the relay 46 to the electromagnetic clutch 3, causing the compressor 26 to operate continuously. If the compressor 26 is locked by some reason, causing the rotational speed of the compressor 26 to slow down, the output voltage of the F V converter 36 will fall, while the output voltage representing the engine speed does not change. Then the output of I the comparator 42 goes low, cutting off the power transistor 44. Then the electromagnetic clutch 3 is deenergized and the compressor 26 is disactivated. Figure 3 is a block diagram showing another embodiment of the control circuit 30 shown in Fig. 2.The circuit includes a divide by m counter 52 for counting the number of revolutions of the compressor 26 and a divide by n counter 54 for counting the number of revolutions of the engine. The counter capacities are chosen as n 2 and m 3xk where k is the pulley diameter ratio for a 4 cylinder engine, or n 3 and m 3xk for a 6 cylinder engine. This means that for a 4 cylinder engine, the ignition coil 28 provides pulses at a rate of 2 pulses per revolution of the engine and the pickup 22 provides pulses at a rate of 3xk pulses per revolution of the engine. The count value a of the divide by m counter 52 is divided by the count b of the divide by n counter 53 by the divider 56, and the resultant output a b from the divider 56 is compared with a reference voltageVref by the comparator 58.If the compressor slows down by being locked and Vref becomes larger than a b, the power transistor 44 is cut off so that the electromagnetic clutch 3 is disactivated. In the foregoing embodiment, the engine speed is detected by utilization of voltage pulses produced by the ignition coil 28, however, an alternative means may be employed for this purpose. For example, a crank angle sensor as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,728,565 to O callaghan issued on April 17, 1973 may be used. Figure 4 shows the rotor and electromagnetic pickup used in the crank angle sensor. The arrangement of Fig. 4 includes a rotor 60 coupled to the engine shaft, bosses 62 arranged on the circumferential surface of the rotor 60, an electromagnetic pickup 64 for detecting the engine speed, and pickup output terminals 66 which are to be connected to the waveform shaper 38 in Fig. 2 or 3. Figure 5 shows still another embodiment of means for detecting the engine speed. The arrangement includes a crank pulley 68 coupled to the engine so that the pulley drives the rotor 7 of the electromagnetic clutch through the belt 21. The crank pulley 68 is provided with ferromagnetic bosses 70, which confront the electromagnetic pickup 64. According to the present invention, the ratio of the engine speed to the compressor speed can be evaluated accurately, and the electromagnetic clutch can be deenergized reliably if the compressor is locked.Thus bearings of the electromagnetic clutch can be protected and the drive belt can be protected from being damaged. Consequently, seizure of the compressor and cutting off of the belt which cause shock so as to adversely affect the drivers operation, can be prevented, and a safe driving is made possible even if the compressor is locked. Particularly, safety driving is assured for vehicles which have engine accessory such as a poweraided steering pump driven through the input rotor of the electromagnetic clutch as mentioned previously.
