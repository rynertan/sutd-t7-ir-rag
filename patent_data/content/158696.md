## Description
EXPANDABLE SYNTHETIC RESINOUS THERMOPLASTIC PARTICLES, METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF AND THE APPLICATION THEREFOR Expandable synthetic resinous particles, the preparation of such particles, expansion of such particles and the fabrication of such particles into various shaped objects is well known in the art. The most common of the expandable particles presently available are expandable polystyrene particles. Many well known shaped articles are prepared by molding such expandable polystyrene particles such as foam plastic cups, foam coolers, and various shaped dunnage materials.Such particles of expandable polystyrene generally are available in a variety of sizes ranging from less than 1 millimeter to several millimeters prior to expansion.Expandable particles having varied configuration are also known which on expansion provide foamed dunnage material for loose fill packaging. Such expandable polystyrene particles usually consist of a polystyrene matrix having therein a volatile fluid foaming agent, often a chlorofluorocarbon and more frequently an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as pentane. Generally, such particles are expanded or foamed by heating either in hot air, hot liquid or steam. Steam provides a convenient and relatively rapid means of heating the particles to a desired foaming temperature because of its high heat capacity, rapid transfer of heat to the expanding particle and ready availability. Usually, such expandable particles when heated for a short time with an appropriate heating medium such as steam, expand to a volume which is somewhat less than the theoretical volume of the volatile fluid foaming agent at the temperature of expansion when the particles are cooled to ambient temperature.In many cases where the permeability of the volatile fluid foaming agent is low relative to the permeability rate of air through the cell walls of the expanded particle, expansion in excess of the theoretical volume as might be determined from the pressure volume temperature relationship of the volatile fluid foaming agent may be obtained. This is often referred to as the osmotic effect, wherein additional blowing or expanding capability is obtained by diffusion of the air into the expanded particle at a rate substantially greater than the diffusion of the volatile fluid foaming agent out of the expanded particle. In such instances air is generally considered as a secondary blowing agent.Often when such particles have been expanded in the presence of air, steam, or air and steam, and the particles are cooled relatively rapidly to ambient temperature, shrinkage is observed wherein the size or volume of the particle appears markedly reduced as the temperature is reduced. Judicious aging of such particles generally in an air atmosphere will result often in a return of the particles to the original expanded volume. Such judicious aging of the particles in an air atmosphere frequently results in additional diffusion of air into the cells resulting in a total pressure within the cells greater than atmospheric pressure, in which case further expansion of the particle can be obtained when heated to an appropriate expanding temperature, usually about 20 to 50 degrees centigrade over the glass temperature of the expandable polymer. Spherical and nonspherical particles of the expandable variety advantageously are employed in many instances as loose fill dunnage materials. Such dunnage materials are commercially available in a variety of configurations . However, the majority of the expandable particles employed in commerce are generally spherical and employed for the molding of a variety of shaped articles. Expandable plastic particles of relatively small diameter are utilized for the molding of the familiar plastic foam cups, whereas larger diameter particles are employed for the preparation of shaped dunnage and molding of shaped articles such as food coolers and insulation board. Some of the expandable plastic particles are employed for the extrusion of foamed sheet which frequently is further shaped into containers, such as are employed in the fast food restaurants, meat trays, egg cartons and apple trays.Expandable synthetic resinous thermoplastic particles have also been employed in the decorative area wherein particles have been adhered to a base, for example paper, and subsequently foamed to provide a desired raised configuration. They also have been molded or shaped into a desired configuration, and decoration subsequently added thereto. There are a variety of modes for the preparation of such particles and a variety of methods for their expansion and molding into shaped articles. Generally, expandable synthetic resinous particles or expanded synthetic resinous particles must be molded within a relatively limited temperature range that is sufficiently high to cause expansion of the particle and fusion of the particles with adjacent particles to form a unitary body but not so high that the molded articles collapse.Generally, if such particles are heated excessively and collapse during or after molding, the resultant molded body will have a volume less than the volume of the mold and consequently a shape which is usually undesired. To broaden the operable molding range of expandable synthetic resinous thermoplastic particles, some particles having been designated as thermal collapse resistant particles. Usually such particles are prepared employing a very minor amount of crosslinking agent which extends, considerably, the temperature range over which they may be utilized or expanded. Such crosslinking is most often accomplished during the polymerization of the particles. The quantity of the crosslinking agent employed to prepare thermal collapse resistant particles varies over a generally narrow range and provides usually only sufficient crosslinking to render the particles swellable but insoluble in a solvent for a corresponding polymer prepared without benefit of a crosslinking agent.Usually the desired amount of crosslinking agent is that which is sufficient to render the particles insoluble and yet exhibit a maximum, or at least a close to maximum, degree of swelling when placed in a solvent for the linear polymer. Many patents exist concerned with expandable synthetic resinous thermoplastic particles and their preparation, expansion and molding. Representative are U.S. Patents 2,275,164 2,848,427 2,884,386 3,639,551 and 4,226,942. Generally, the products prepared from such expandable particles may be classified into two general categories low density, usually having a density of from about 16 to 48 kg m3 1 to 3 pound per cubic foot , and high density with densities ranging from about 320 480 kg m3 20 to 30 pounds per cubic foot .When the term density is employed, it refers to the true density of a particle or molded article and not to the bulk density of a plurality of particles. For many applications, it is desired to have very low density foamed articles. The prior art refers to some expanded particles and articles having density below about 16 kg m3 1 pcf . However, such particles and articles in general have been very brittle with poor physical properties and limited applications. For example, a sheet of thermal insulation, must have substantial physical resistance to mechanical handling during installation. Breakage is expensive both from a material standpoint and from the labor required to repair or replace such articles. Furthermore, most foams fabricated from polystyrene are relatively stiff, non resilient, and relatively rigid foams. For example, many of these foams when crushed to 10 percent of their original volume do not readily recover their original dimension prior to crushing. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an expandable synthetic resinous particle which may be expanded to a density of less than 16 kg m3 1 pcf which can be formed into a foam body which is resilient. It is a further object of this invention to provide a method for the preparation of such particles, for the foaming of such particles to provide a foamed particle of a desired low density, and for the preparation of molded articles of very low density, from particles in accordance with the present invention. These benefits are obtained in a plurality of heat expandable synthetic resinous particles, the particles forming a gel when placed in a solvent for an uncrosslinked composition of generally like monomeric constitution, the particles having a swelling factor of at least 20 and a cross linking coefficient of from about 0.8 to about 2.5 with the further limitation that the particles on heating to a temperature above the glass transition temperature of the polymer expand to at least 40 times their original volume at ambient temperature and on being pressurized at a pressure of at least 3 atmospheres in air for a period of 24 hours be capable of two fold expansion when subjected to the conditions employed to expand the particles to at least 40 times their original volume. Also contemplated within the scope of the present invention is a plurality of synthetic resinous particles comprising a copolymer of styrene and divinylbenzene, which forming a gel when placed in toluene at ambient temperature wherein the ratio of the weight of the swollen gel to the unswollen particle obtained by immersion of a particle in toluene is between about 20 and 35, the particles containing a volatile organic blowing agent selected from the group consisting of fluorocarbons and hydrocarbons and mixtures thereof, the polymer of the particles having a crosslinking coefficient of from about 0.8 to about 2.5 the particles being capable of expanding to at least 40 times their unfoamed volume at a temperature of 1300 centigrade with the further limitation that the foamed particles on being pressurized at a pressure of at least 3 atmospheres of air for a period of 24 hours are capable of a two fold expansion when subsequently heated to a temperature of 130 centigrade with the further limitation that the particles be expandable to a density of less than 12 kg m3 0.75 pcf . Also contemplated within the scope of the present invention is a method for the preparation of a resilient coherent foamed body, the body having a density of from about 3.2 to 24 kg m3 0.2 to 1.5 pcf the steps of the method comprising providing a plurality of heat expandable synthetic resinous particles which form a gel when placed in a solvent for an uncross linked composition of generally like monomeric constitution, the particles having a swelling factor of at least 20 and a crosslinking coefficient of from about 0.8 to about 2.5 with the further limitation that the particles on heating to a temperature above the glass transition temperature of the polymer expand to at least 40 times their original volume at ambient temperature and on being pressurized at a pressure of at least 3 atmospheres in air for a period of 24 hours be capable of two fold expansion when subjected to the conditions employed to expand the particles to at least 40 times their original volume expanding said particles disposing said particles within a closed mold heating said particles to a temperature sufficient to cause further expansion of said particles and to cause adjacent particles to fuse together to form a unitary body which is thermocollapse resistant and resilient. Also contemplated within the scope of the present invention is a coherent unitary foamed body of twice expanded particles in closely adjacent relationship to each other, the adjacent particles being fused together to thereby provide a molded shaped article having a density of from about 3.2 to 24 kg m3 0.2 to 1.5 pcf , beneficially the density being from about 3.2 to 16 kg m3 0.2 to 1 pcf and advantageously from about 3.2 to 12 kg m3 0.2 to 0.75 pcf . Also contemplated within the scope of the present invention is a method for the preparation of coherent foamed bodies in accordance with the present invention having a density of from about 3.2 to 24 kg m3 0.2 to 1.5 pcf and advantageously from about 3.2 to 12 kg m3 0.2 to 0.75 pcf , such bodies being resilient and generally nonbrittle the steps of the method comprising providing a plurality of the hereinbefore described expanded particles, filling a mold with said expanded particles, closing said mold, confining said expanded particles, heating said expanded particles contained within said mold to a temperature of from about 20 degrees centigrade to 60 degrees centigrade above the glass transition temperature of the polymer of said particles to thereby cause further expansion of said particles and to cause adjacent particles to fuse together to form a unitary body which is resilient.By the term resilient is meant that a generally spherical or rectangular particle or article in accordance with the present invention can be compressed between two opposing flat surfaces to 10 percent of an original dimension at a temperature of 230 centigrade for 10 seconds and on removal of the compressing force from the particle or article, the particle or article will reexpand within a period of 10 seconds to at least 80 percent of its original dimension before compressing. In selecting suitable polymers for the practice of the present invention, the swelling factor is of great importance. The swelling factor is determined by immersing a lightly crosslinked polymer in a solvent for the uncrosslinked polymer. Preferably, the polymer and solvent each have similar, if not identical, solubility parameters. Such immersion may take place at atmospheric pressure and ambient or elevated temperatures below the boiling point of the solvent. Generally, such an immersion is made employing ambient temperature for both solvent and polymer. When equilibrium swelling is reached, the weight of the unswollen polymer is divided into the weight of the swollen polymer to provide the swelling factor. In such a determination, sufficient solvent is provided that when equilibrium is reached, two phases are clearly obvious. If the polymer completely dissolves in the solvent, the polymer is unsuitable for the practice of the present invention. When the crosslinking coefficient of the polymer is in a higher range, a relatively stiff and formed gel is obtained, that is a gel in solvent tends to replicate the general configuration of the particle which has been immersed in the solvent. In the lower range of crosslink density, a formless gel is obtained. Any tendency to replicate the configuration of the immersed particle is lost.However, two distinct phases exist the solvent phase and the solvent swollen polymer phase. Conveniently, the gel can be separated from the solvent phase by carefully pouring the contents of the vessel employed to contain the solvent and polymer onto a screen, such as 50 mesh U.S. sieve size screen, the gel being retained on the screen while the solvent passes through. The solvent is removed from the bottom part of the screen, such as by wiping with a paper towel, and the weight of the gel on the screen determined. The ratio of the weight of the gel to the weight of the unswollen particle is the swelling factor. Very desirable expandable particles in accordance with the present invention are obtained when the swelling factor is from about 20 to 35. The crosslinking coefficient is a well known value to those skilled in the art of polymer chemistry and is indicative of the number of crosslinks per weight average molecular weight. The crosslinking coefficient of polymer is discussed at length inAtomic Radiation and Polymers by A. Charlesby, PergamonPress, New York, 1960, pages 140 145. A particularly convenient means for calculating cross linking coefficientZ when styrene and divinylbenzene are employed is by the use of the following equation Z Mw Moles of styrene x 104.14 Moles of divinylbenzene wherein Mw is the weight average molecular weight of polystyrene obtained under identical polymerization conditions but without divinylbenzene. The assumption is made that the divinylbenzene forms only crosslinks, and that it is 100 percent efficient.As varying crosslinking agents are employed, not all are of equal efficiency. Expandable particles in accordance with the present invention may be prepared from a wide variety of monovinyl monomers which are subject to addition polymerization. An essential feature of the material from which articles in accordance with the present invention may be prepared is that monomers employed undergo addition polymerization to form a thermoplastic polymer in the presence of an appropriate amount of crosslinking agent, provide a crosslinking coefficient of from about 0.8 to 2.5 and beneficially from 1.0 to 2.25 advantageously from 1 to 1.5. It is critical to the preparation of particles and articles in accordance with the present invention that the base weight average moelcular weight be equal to or in excess of 150,000 grams per mole.By the term base weight average molecular weight is meant the weight average molecular weight of an addition polymer polymerized under conditions identical to that employed in the preparation of cross linked polymers in accordance with the present invention without a cross linking agent. In the preparation of expandable particles in accordance with the present invention, it is generally desirable to conduct a polymerization of the selected monomer system under approximate polymerization conditions in the absence of a crosslinking agent, subsequently determining the weight average molecular weight of the resultant polymer. If the weight average molecular weight of the resultant polymer is 150,000 grams moles or greater1 conditions are suitable for the preparation of expandable particles in accordance with the present invention when the polymerization is conducted in the presence of an appropriate quantity of crosslinking agent. Suitability for the preparation of particles in accordance with the present invention may be readily confirmed by determining the crosslinking coefficient as hereinbefore set forth. A particle or plurality of particles of the crosslinked polymer are weighed, subsequently immersed in a solvent for the uncrosslinked polymer at ambient temperature about 230C and the particles permitted to swell until equilibrium is reached, that is the maximum degree of swelling is obtained. The solvent swollen polymer hereinafter referred to as gel is then weighed and the weight of the gel is divided by the weight of the unswollen polymer providing a ratio referred to as the swelling factor. Suitable polymers for the present invention are obtained when the swelling factor is 20 or greater. A wide variety of monomers may be employed alone or in combination in the preparation of expandable particles in accordance with the present invention.The major portion of the monomers utilized for the preparation of particles and articles in accordance with the present invention are monovinyl compounds which undergo addition polymerization to provide generally linear polymers, and are capable of forming crosslinked structures when polymerized in the presence of a crosslinking quantity of a polyvinyl compound, such as for example, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, or divinylbenzene. Monovinyl compounds include styrene, vinyltoluene, all three isomers, paravinyltoluene being preferred, chlorostyrenes, and bromostyrenes, which form linear polymers in the absence of a crosslinking agent.Minor quantities, that is less than about 15 weight percent of other monomers such as ethylstyrene tertiarybutylstyrene, methyl acryl ate, methylmethacrylate, acrylic acid, and acrylonitrile, may be copolymerized with styrene and or the substituted styrenes. The choice of the particular monovinyl materials employed in the practice of the present invention will depend primarily on the ready availability of such material and the physical properties desired in the resultant product. A wide variety of crosslinking agents may be employed in the practice of the present invention including divinylbenzene, diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diisopropenylbenzene, diisopropenyldiphenyl, diallylmaleate, diallylphthalate, allylacrylates, allylmethacrylates, allylfumarates, allylitaconates, alkyd resin types, butadiene or isoprene polymers, cyclooctadiene, methylene norbornylenes, divinyl phthalates, vinyl isopropenylbenzene, divinyl biphenyl, as well as any other di or poly functional compound known to be of use as a crosslinking agent in polymeric vinyl addition compositions. Also useful for obtaining the desired degree of crosslinking is high energy ionizing radiation and free radical generating peroxides. The efficiency of such crosslinking materials often is affected by other materials present in the polymerization system. Thus, the particular quantity of the crosslinking monomer utilized in the present invention can vary within wide limits depending on the specific composition of the mixture of monomerics being polymerized and the nature of the initiators used in the promotion of such polymerization.By way of illustration, in the polymerization of styrene to form particles in accordance with the present invention, utilizing benzoyl peroxide as a primary free radical polymerization initiator and divinylbenzene as the crosslinking agent and tertiary butyl peroxy benzoate as a secondary initiator, polymers having a like swelling factor may be prepared using various levels of benzoyl peroxide but to obtain a like swelling index the quantity of divinyl benzene must be increased as quantity of benzoyl peroxide is increased, wherein all other polymerizations quantities and conditions are maintained constant. Thus suitable polymers for use in the practice of the present invention having generally identical physical properties insofar as swelling index and expansions are concerned, may be obtained under a variety of conditions, the polymerization rate may be controlled to obtain a rate particularly suitable for the polymerization equipment. Such polymerizations are generally exothermic and removal of the heat of polymerization is necessary to obtain a polymer having a desired weight average molecular weight between crosslinks. Particular polymerization conditions and crosslinker concentration are readily determined by anyone with minimal skill in the art. Many primary blowing agents may be employed.Generally, such blowing agents are low boiling organic compounds and include such materials as dichloro difluoromethane, pentafluorochloroethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, butane, isobutane, isopentane, neopentane, and 2,3 dimethylbutane. A critical characteristic that the primary blowing agent must possess is that the diffusion rate of the primary blowing agent through polymeric cell walls of an expanded particle is less than the diffusion rate of an inert nonorganic secondary blowing agent, such as steam, air, and nitrogen.Blowing agents may be employed alone or as a mixture of blowing agents. There are two principle methods for incorporation of the primary blowing agent within the expandable particles often referred to as the polymerize in or the steep in methods. Employing the polymerize in method, the primary blowing agent is admixed with the monomeric material prior to polymerization into expandable particles. On polymerization of the monomeric material, the primary blowing agent is generally uniformly distributed within such particles and the product of the polymerization is an expandable bead. The second process, or steeping in process requires the formation of the polymer particle prior to the addition of the primary blowing agent.Such a steeping in process may be accomplished by the addition of a primary blowing agent during or on completion of the suspension polymerization step. For example, when the polymerization is partially complete, the primary blowing agent may be added to the reactor.Since the primary blowing agents are organic in nature, they are preferentially incorporated into the polymer particles rather than in the suspending water phase employed for polymerization. Alternate to the aqueous steep in process is the so called dry process, wherein after polymerization the polymer particles may be coated with an anticlumping agent, often a silicaeous material, for example, a finely divided particulate clay, and the particles and primary blowing agent enclosed within a vessel for a sufficient length of time to permit the primary blowing agent to swell the polymerized particle. Advantageously, such a dry steeping in process may be conducted at any temperature below that at which the particles exhibit a significant tendency to adhere to each other, such temperature being dependent in part upon the glass transition temperature of the polymer.Any coating such as particulate clay which has been applied to the particles to prevent agglomeration thereof, during the steeping operation, may or may not be removed by appropriate washing after impregnation with blowing agent. The first or primary expansion of particles in accordance with the present invention is readily accomplished employing techniques well known in the art, such as exposing the particles to hot air or steam at atmospheric pressure, subatmospheric pressure or superatmospheric pressure, depending on the particular polymer utilized and the glass transition temperature of such a polymer. In the event that styrene is utilized as the principle monomer, steam is sufficient to cause the first expansion of the particles to a volume approximating that of the volume of the volatile fluid blowing agent contained therein which would be expected at the temperature of expansion. Alternatively, such particles may be first expanded by exposure to heated inert gas such as air, or nitrogen which is nonreactive with the polymer under conditions of expansion.Such expansion may occur in an oven or an expander designed specifically for expandable particles. Alternativley, such an expansion may take place by immersing the particles in a heated liquid for example, hot water. After the initial or primary expansion of particles in accordance with the invention the particles may be aged with or without cooling in a gas such as air, or nitrogen, which has a permeability rate through the cell walls of the polymer greater than the permeability rate of the primary blowing agent through the cell walls of the foamed particles. Generally, on heating in such an inert atmosphere, the particles have a tendency to expand even further. When the desired degree of expansion is obtained in the primary expansion, the particles alternatively may be cooled to room temperature, or at least below the glass transition temperature of the polymer and subjected to inert gas at superatmospheric pressure. Generally, on applying superatmospheric pressure to the particles at room temperature, shrinkage occurs wherein the cell walls of the particles tend to wrinkle somewhat.Such particles are often referred to as raisin like . Alternatively, particles in accordance with the present invention, may be subjected to superatmospheric pressure at their expansion temperature until the inert gas has diffused into the particles to the desired degree. Reduction of the pressure on the particles to either atmospheric pressure or subatmospheric pressure results in further or secondary expansion of the particles by a factor of at least 2 volumes. The first alternative route to expanding the particles after the first expansion wherein the particles have been cooled to room temperature and pressurized with an inert gas, they may be subsequently heated to provide a second expansion wherein a substantial increase in the ratio of foam volume to solid volume is obtained. In the initial expansion, generally the ratio of the foam volume to the solid volume is in the range of about 20 to 120 and desirably is in excess of 40.Generally, employing the technique of the secondary expansion, that is, the inducing diffusion of inert gas into the cells, results in a particle which on heating to a temperature of from about 200 to 600C above its glass transition temperature results in particles having a foam volume to solid volume ratio of from about 80 to as much as 500. The degree of expansion desired in the secondary expansion is dependent on the end use intended for the particles being employed. In the event that they are utilized as loose fill dunnage, maximum expansion generally can be tolerated if the dunnage is to be employed with articles of relatively low density. If the particles are to be employed for molding shaped articles, generally less than maximum expansion is desired in that additional expansion in the mold is required to obtain a solid generally gas and liquid impermeable body. Desirable low density particles can be obtained by prolonged heating at atmospheric pressure in air or by heating for very short periods at subatmospheric pressure and subsequently allowing the particles to reinflate at atmospheric pressure. A plurality of volatile organic blowing agents were evaluated for the preparation of particles and articles in accordance with the present invention. Such blowing agents including dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, trichlorotrifluoroethane, butane, isobutane, pentane, isopentane, neopentane, and 2,3 dimethyl butane, were found to provide desirable performance as primary blowing agents in lightly crosslinked particles. In preparation of moldings in accordance with the present invention, generally it is desirable to employ particles which have been pressurized with an inert gas such as nitrogen, or air. Due to the permeability of the cell walls of the particles to the secondary blowing agent, it is desirable to transfer the pressurized moldable particles rapidly into the mold and heat the particles to a desired molding temperature without undue delay. Inert gas diffuses into the particles fairly readily under superatmosphereic pressure and when the particles are returned to atmospheric pressure, the inert gas will diffuse from the particles. Depending upon the temperature and conditions, such diffusion from the particles may take place in a matter of minutes or an hour or two.Therefore, in order to obtain maximum benefit from the pressurizing Step, rapid molding of the particles after depressurization is desirable. Temperatures employed in the molding of particles in accordance with the present invention, are generally commensurate with those employed in the molding of higher density articles, which are normally obtained from conventional expandable synthetic resinous particles. For most purposes, particles in accordance with the present invention are generally spherical in nature. Such spherical particles may be prepared by suspension polymerization of an appropriate monomer and primary organic blowing agent in aqueous suspension in the presence of appropriate catalysts or polymerization initiators. Alternatively, particles may be obtained by the extrusion of strands of circular or other crosssectional configuration, cutting the strands into short lenghs, short lengths meaning particles having a length approximating the maximum cross sectional dimension of the strand for example, cylinders having a length of from one half to two and one half times the diameter of the strand.Such particles generally may be dispersed in an inert dispersing medium, such as water, and heated above the glass transition temperature of the polymer, whereupon the surface tension forces the elongate particles to assume a generally spherical configuration. Such particles may or may not contain the organic volatile blowing agent. If such particles contain the volatile fluid foaming agent, such heating is generally done under pressure. Alternatively, the particles may be impregnated with the volatile fluid foaming agent while simultaneously being heated to provide particles having the desired spherical configuration. Oftentimes in the preparation of synthetic resinous thermoplastic dunnage materials, a configured ribbon of material may be extruded. For example, such a ribbon may have a tri lobal configuration or anS shaped configuration, the extruded strand being rapidly guenched in a cooling medium, for example, cold water so that on extrusion the ribbon containing the volatile fluid foaming agent does not foam or expand, and the ribbon is severed into short lengths which may subsequently be expanded through a primary expansion step and a secondary expansion step in the manner hereinbefore described to provide low density desirable dunnage materials. In the practice of the present invention, various tests may be performed which simplify the determination of the suitability of a specific combination of a particular crosslinked density polymer, expansion agent and foaming conditions which provide a convenient route to a desirable expandable particle without the necessity of taking more difficult analytical steps. It is essential and critical to the practice of the present invention that the volatile fluid organic blowing agents employed in what may be considered a lightly crosslinked polymer have a diffusion rate through the polymer which is substantially less than the diffusion rate of air, nitrogen or other conveniently available gaseous material through the polymer.As the expandable particles in accordance with the present invention achieve their highly desirable low density, most often by means of sequential expansion steps, it is desirable that the volatile fluid organic foaming or blowing agent preferentially remain within the polymer, that is, blowing agent loss from the particle be relatively low. Generally, on the initial expansion of an expandable particle in accordance with the present invention, primary blowing or primary expansion is caused by the vaporization of the volatile fluid organic blowing agent when the polymer is held at a desired heat plastifying temperature for a relatively short period of time for example, less than 30 minutes, and beneficially less than 10 minutes, and desirably less than 5 minutes.A very useful evaluation procedure for identifying desirable polymer blowing agents which may be single compounds or combinations Thereof, is hereinafter set forth wherein the temperatures and pressures are related particularly to styrene polymers.It should be recognized by those of minimal skill in the art that some deviation in temperatures and pressures and variation of blowing agents will require modifications of the conditions hereinafter set forth. Such modified conditions are readily selected by those knowledgable in the art of synthetic resinous thermoplastic foams. A critical factor to the performance of expandable particles in accordance with the present invention is so called secondary foaming response the secondary foaming response being a measure of the expansion of an expanded particle when exposed to conditions such that a second expansion may be obtained.In order to evaluate the performance of a particular volatile organic blowing agent, whether such blowing agent be a single chemical compound or mixtures thereof, the following steps are found to provide a convenient and rapid route wherein the specific temperatures, and times are exemplary of styrene polymer particles about 1 millimeter average diameter. Step 1 Beneficially, a particle, believed to be in accordance with the particles of the present invention, which is crosslinked to the required degree and contains volatile fluid foaming agent, is heat plastified by heating at a temperature of from about 1100 to 1500C to provide once foamed particles.Most advantageously a temperature of 1300C may be employed and by causing an initial expansion or foaming of the particle to obtain an expansion ratio of from about 45 to 50 volumes the expansion ratio being the ratio of the initially expanded foam to the volume of the solid unfoamed particle, and can be expressed asEMI22.1 tb ER SEP SEP Volume SEP of SEP Foam tb Initial SEP Solid SEP Volume SEP f SEP SEP Vf V5 tb Equation I Step 2 When Step 1 has been completed and an expansion ratio of about 50 is attained, the particles under evaluation are cooled and permitted to age in air at room temperature and ambient atmospheric pressure for a period of about 4 to 24 hours. Step 2 may be considered as a first or primary aging step.Step 3 The particles obtained in Step 2 are exposed to a gas under pressure such as air or nitrogen most advantageously air at a pressure of about 446 kPa 50 psig for a period of 20 hours plus or minus 30 minutes at room temperature. By room temperature is meant a temperature approximating 23 C. On the completion ofStep 3, the gas pressure inside the foam particles will generally be equal to the external gas pressure applied to the particles. More preferably stated, P. the internal pressure and PO the external pressure will be approximately equal.Step 4 The gas pressure on the pressurized particles obtained in Step 3 is decreased to ambient atmospheric pressure thus the applied pressure to the particles will be equal to atmospheric pressure7 and the internal pressure within the foamed and pressurized particles will approximate to a very close degree the applied pressure in Step 3.Step 5 Sample of the pressurized particles fromStep 4 are heated in air at a temperature of about 1300C for periods of 1, 3 and 5 minutes to provide twice foamed particles. Such heating should be done within 3 minutes of reducing the applied pressure employed in Step 3 to atmospheric pressure as in Step 4. After heating for the various periods of time specified, the resultant samples of particles are cooled to ambient temperature, and density of the particles are measured beneficially by water displacement. For convenience, the density of the polystyrene may be considered to be 1, although the actual value is 1.045 g cc.Step 6 A secondary foaming ratio is determined by dividing the volume of the twice foamed particle by the volume of the once foamed particle to determine a secondary foaming ratio SFR . As particles have been heated for periods of 1, 3 and 5 minutes, three usually different secondary foaming ratios are obtained which may be designated as SFR 1, SFR 3, and SFR 5. Generally, wherein if any one of these ratios has a value greater than 4, the particles are considered to be excellent.If any one of the secondary foaming ratios obtained is within the ratio of about 3.5 to 4, the particles can be considered to be very good. If any one of the secondary foaming ratios lies between 3 and 3.5, the particles are classed as good. If the secondary foaming ratio is between about 2 and 3, the particles may be considered fair to marginal. The secondary foaming ratio employed in the foregoing evaluation or rating is the maximum of SFR 1, SFR 3 or SFR 5 whichever exhibits the greatest ratio. In the event that none of the secondary foaming ratios as determined at 1, 3 and 5 minutes is greater than 2, the particles generally are unsatisfactory. Of great advantage in selecting a desirable volatile fluid foaming agent for use in the practice of the present invention is the relationship between the solubility parameters of the polymer and the blowing agent employed. The solubility parameter is readily approximated employing Equation II s H25 RT 0.5 II V wherein a5 is the solubility parameter of the blowing agent, AH25 is the molar heat of the vaporization at 250C expressed in calories per gram mole, R is the gas constant conveniently taken as 1.98, T is the absolute temperature and V is the molar volume in cubic centimeters per gram mole.The molar heat of vaporization H25 is approximated by Equation III H25 23.7 Tb 0.02 Tbê 2950 III wherein Tb is the boiling point in degrees Kelvin. The solubility parameter of the polymer can be calculated from the molar attraction constants in accordance with the teaching of J. Brandrup and E. H. Immergut, IV 366,John Wiley Sons, 1966, which generally states that maximum solubility of a polymer is observed when the energy of vaporization per unit volume of the polymer and solvent are equal. A convenient value for the solubility parameter of polystyrene is 9.1 as set forth in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science Technology, Volume 13, page 252, John wily Sons, 1970.When the volatile fluid organic blowing agent is a mixture, the solubility parameter is calculated assuming a simple additivity of the product of the solubility parameter of each solvent multiplied by the mole fraction thereof in the blowing mixture. Where the primary foaming ratio is equal to or greater than 50 and the absolute difference between the solubility parameter of the polymer and the volatile fluid foaming agent is equal to or greater than 2.5, and the secondary foaming ratio is equal to or greater than 2.5 under the conditions set forth provides desirable foam particles. Preferably, the secondary foaming ratio is equal to or greater than 3.5. In order to obtain a suitable foam, volatile blowing agents are employed which exhibit a minimal tendency to cause craze formation, cracking or openings in the cell walls. When particles are depressurized as in Step 4, the stress of the cell walls is approximated by Equation IV a AP i.5 ER IV wherein cw is the stress in the cell wall bP is the difference in pressure inside the foam cells and the pressure external to the particles, and ER designates the expansion ratio. Typical values for stress in the cell walls wherein P is 303 kPa 44 psi and expansion ratios of. 40, 50 and 60 are obtained, result in stresses of 18.2, 22.8 and 27.3 mPa 2,640, 3,300 and 3,960 psi , respectively. As the particles in accordance with the present invention produce foams of very low density, the cell walls are thin relative to most commercially available thermoplastic resinous foams.Oftentimes, such wall thicknesses are in the order of 1,000 to 10,000 angstroms in thickness. If crazing or cracks in the cell walls occur before secondary expansion, the secondary foaming ratio will be undesirably low. The Figure depicts the relationship between the difference in solubility parameters and secondary foaming for several common blowing agents, including isobutane, normal butane, normal pentane, isopentane, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane and 1,1,2 trichloro 1,2,2 trifluoroethane. Table I sets forth a variety of compounds together with their boiling point in degrees centigrade, density, solubility parameters and the difference in solubility parameters between polystyrene and the blowing agent.

By way of further illustration, a mixture of 75 25 parts by weight of dichlorodifluoromethane and trichlorofluoromethane provides a mixture having 0.775 mole fraction of the difluoro compound and 0.225 of the monofluoro compound.

The invention is further illustrated but not limited by the following examples Example 1 A plurality of spherical polymer particles having an average diameter of 1.53 millimeters are prepared by suspension polymerization employing the following composition Styrene 99.65 parts by weight Divinylbenzene 0.04 part by weight Ethylvinylbenzene 0.01 part by weight Benzoyl peroxide 0.2 part by weight Tertiarybutyl peroxybenzoate 0.1 part by weight 100 parts by weight of the foregoing mixture was dispersed in 300 parts by weight of water which contained 0.2 part by weight of methylcellulose as a suspending agent, the parts by weight of methyl cellulose being based on the total quantity of water. The dispersion was agitated and heated to a temperature of 800C for 20 hours. Polymerization was completed by raising the temperature of the suspension to 950C for an additional 10 hour period.When the foregoing procedure is repeated without the divinylbenzene and ethylvinylbenzene, polystyrene is obtained having a weight average molecular weight of 373,000 grams per mole as determined by gel permeation chromatography. The swelling factor of the styrene divinylbenzene copolymer was determined by immersing particles of the resulting suspension in toluene for a period of 24 hours at a temperature of about 250C. The swelling factor was 30, the weight of the swollen gel divided by the weight of the unswollen particle. The crosslinking coefficient calculated in the hereinbefore described manner was 1.15. A portion of the crosslinked polymer particles was coated with submicron Kaolinite clay sold under the trade designation of Ajax Jigger P from Georgia KaolinCo. 9.8 grams of the crosslinked styrene polymer were coated with 1.96 grams of clay by shaking the polymer particles with the clay. The clay coated particles were placed in a glass ampule having a volume of 34.5 cc together with 5 cc of a mixture of three parts by weight of dichlorodifluoromethane and one part by weight of trichlorofluoromethane. The glass ampule was sealed and placed in a water bath maintained at about 8O0C and rotated end over end at a rate of about 10 revolutions per minute for a period of 66 hours.The temperature of the ampule ranged from initial room temperature to 80 C. The ampule and contents were subsequently cooled in dry ice and recovered polymer beads were stored at a temperature of 200C. Six experiments were carried out in this manner wherein the pressurization temperature varied from about room temperature to about 80 degrees centigrade and the pressurization time for five of the samples was 66 hours and for one of the samples was 16 hours. The results are set forth in Table II. TABLE II Preparation of Expandable Particles by Impregnation 1.53 mm Styrene co 0.04 Divinylbenzene Beads with 75 25 CF2C12 CFC13 Mixture Est.

The foamability of Samples 1 through 6 inTable II was determined by placing portions of the blowing agent impregnated beads in a hot air oven having an internal temperature of 1300C. The beads were placed in 57 millimeter diameter 0.10 millimeter thick aluminum foil weighing dishes. After various time intervals at 1300C, the expanded crosslinked expandable polystyrene particles were removed from the oven and the expansion ratio determined. By the expansion ratio is meant the volume of the foam particle divided by The volume of the solid particle prior to foaming.The density and volume of the foamed particles were determined by measuring their buoyancy in water at room temperature. The foaming characteristics of Samples 1 through 6 under various conditions are set forth inTable III.

From Tables II and III it should be noted that Sample 1 had a significantly lower foaming ability primarily due to the lower volatile organic blowing agent concentration in the particle and at 30 minutes reached a maximum foam volume of the 106 times the volume of the initial particles. The remaining Samples 2 6 having generally equivalent volatile blowing agent contents exhibited generally superior foaming ability and reached volumes of somewhat over 200 times the volume of the initial particles. Maximum foam volumes reached by Samples 1 6 were in all cases greater than the theoretical volume that one would expect from merely the expansion of the volatile organic blowing agent.Sample 1 has about twice the volume that one would expect from expansion of volatile organic blowing agent only, whereas the other samples average about 2.97 times the volume expected from the primary blowing agent only. These samples exhibit the osmotic pressure foaming effect wherein the hot air permeates into the particle at a rate that is more rapid than the diffusion rate of the volatile organic blowing agent from the particle. Subatmospheric foaming of portions of Samples 1 6 was conducted employing a glass thimble made from a tapered female 45 50 glass joint having a capacity of approximately 100 cubic centimeters. The glass tube was closed remote from the ground portion of the joint.The thimble was heated in a stainless steel beaker which had been heated in a hot air oven. The glass thimble was heated at 1300C for a period of 25 minutes prior to dropping eight cross linked expandable polystyrene polystyrene particles of a sample into it.Particles were permitted to foam at atmospheric pressure for varying periods of time. At the end of that time, a matching male joint was engaged with the thimble to provide a generally closed chamber connected to a vacuum tank by a three way valve. The heated particles were foamed under a pressure of about 0.01 atmosphere for 25 to 30 seconds. When the foaming was complete, the thimble was removed from the oven and immersed into ice water for a period of about 25 30 seconds and the pressure was restored to 1 atmosphere absolute, the foam particles were recovered and the expansion ratio determined immediately after atmospheric pressure had been restored. The particles were permitted to remain in normal atmospheric pressure for about 24 hours and the expansion ratio again determined. The results are set forth in Table IV.

This column lists Vf Vs values after the particles have been exposed to air under 1 atmosphere at room temperature for 24 hours. It is evident from Table IV that foamed particles of extremely low densities may be obtained employing techniques in accordance with the invention. Note that Sample 4 has been expanded to 430 times its initial volume. A second series of foaming experiments were conducted wherein a reduced pressure within the thimble was varied from about 0.01 to 0.4 atmosphere absolute..Except as noted in Table V, conditions were generally as described for the foaming results set forth inTable IV.

As is evident from Table V, generally in order to obtain particles of minimal density, it is desirable that additional foaming or secondary foaming be accomplished at pressures less than about 0.25 atmospheres absolute. Another method of secondary foaming of expandable cross linked particles is demonstrated by the following experiment wherein the particles are exposed to an inert gas. Portions of particles from Samples 1 6 were heated for a period of 70 seconds in air at aftemperature of about 1300C to produce foam particles having an expansion ratio of about 55. The expanded beads were cooled to room temperature and exposed to normal atmospheric pressure. Subsequently, the foam particles were subjected to nitrogen under a pressure of about 450 kPa 50 psig for various periods of time, the nitrogen uptake determined and the internal pressure within the foam particles calculated. The results are set forth in Table VI. TABLE VI Pressurization of 55 Volume EP 1 6 Beads With 450 kPa N2 at Room Temperature N2 Uptake Calc.

By way of comparison, a sample of crosslinked expandable polystyrene Sample 7 whose expansion ratio was 55, was maintained at atmospheric condition prior to reheating to 1300C, foamed to 74 volumes on exposure for 15 seconds to 130 0 air on 30 seconds exposure 81 volumes. After 1 minute exposure, 86 volumes and on 3 minute exposure, 94 volumes and 5 minute exposure, 98 volumes.

Portions of the resultant sample were permitted to remain at atmospheric pressure for different periods of time and subsequently foamed by exposure to hot air at a temperature of 1300C for various periods of time.The results are set forth in Table VIII.

However, desirable foam volumes may be obtained after a considerable period of time. For optimum results, such a foaming should occur within about one quarter of an hour after depressurizing the particles. A plurality of particles of Sample No. 6 were heated for a period of one minute in air having a temperature of 130 C. The resultant foamed particles had a foam volume to solid volume ratio of 50. The resultant foamed particles were subjected to a pressure of 450 kPa of nitrogen for a period of 41 hours. Portions ofThe pressurized foamed particles were heated for various periods of time in air having a temperature of 130 C.The external pressure on the particles was reduced to 0.265 atmospheres absolute for a period of 25 to 30 seconds prior to cooling to room temperature and restoring the external pressure on the particles to one atmosphere absolute. The resultant heating times and volume ratios obtained are set forth in Table IX.

Monomer droplets were sized to produce 0.93 millimeter diameter lightly crosslinked copolymer beads employing as the monomer phase 99.65 weight percent styrene, 0.04 weight percent divinylbenzene, 0.01 weight percent ethylvinylbenzene, 0.2 weight percent benzoyl peroxide, and 0.1 weight percent tertiarybutylperoxy benzoate. The generally uniform sized spheroidal polymer beads were prepared employing a vertically mounted stainless steel column having a height of 2 meters and an inside diameter of about 1.5 centimeters.The column was filled with an aqueous solution of about 0.3 weight percent of a carboxymethylmethylceullulose as a suspending agent the suspending medium, that is the aqueous solution of a carboxymethylmethylcellulose, was at a temperature of about 220C. At the bottom of the column was an orifice plate having a diameter of about 3.8 centimeters and 9 openings of a diameter of about 0.4 millimeter and a land length of about 0.10 of a millimeter. The openings in the orifice plate were situated in the form of a square having 3 openings per side, with each of the openings being about 12 millimeters from the nearest adjacent opening. Beneath the orifice plate is a monomer reservoir connected to a monomer source. A column was provided with a suspending medium source in the form of a sidearm disposed about 5 centimeters above the orifice plate.A piston is disposed within the monomer reservoir in such a manner that the volume of the reservoir may be varied. The piston was connected to a variable frequency acoustic exciter.The generally cylindrical walls of the monomer reservoir serve as cylinder walls and the piston was employed to transmit the reciprocating motion produced by the exciter to the monomer mixture, thereby causing the monomer mixture to pass through the orifice plate in an intermittent manner which has the frequency of the variable frequency acoustical exciter. The intermittent expulsion of monomer solution from the monomer reservoir resulted in a plurality of relatively uniform diameter monomer droplets in the aqueous solution of carboxymethylmethylcellulose. The frequency of oscillation was about 330 cycles per second. The resultant dispersion of generally uniform sized monomer droplets was transferred from the column to a polymerization reactor. A 1 percent by weight solution of carboxymethyl methylcellulose was added to the reaction mixture to provide a carboxymethyl methylcellulose concentration of 0.2 weight percent.The suspension being polymerized was about 55 volume percent of monomer droplets, based on the total volume of monomer and the dispersing phase. The polymerization reactor had an anchor type agitator rotated at about a speed of 90 revolutions per minute. The polymerization was conducted at about 800C for 20 hours and an additional 10 hours at a temperature of 950C. A portion of the resultant particles were immersed in toluene for a period of 24 hours at room temperature and the swelling factor was determined to be 26.8. A plurality of 9.8 gram samples of the lightly crosslinked particles were coated with 0.2 gram of AjaxJigger P clay and pressurized with various blowing agents in the hereinbefore described manner. The pressurization time was about 16 hours at a temperature of 800C. The experimental data is summarized in Table X.

The swelling factor for the crosslinked polymers was determined by immersing 1 millimeter thick cast sheets in toluene for a period of 24 hours and subsequently weighing the resultant gel and dividing the weight of the resultant gel by the weight of the unswollen sheet.

The resultant blowing agent impregnated particles were stored for a period of 24 hours at a temperature of 200C.

Examination of the particles prepared inTable XIII by compression between fingertips indicated substantial variation in toughness between foams prepared with different benzoyl peroxide concentrations.Variability of toughness was quantified by measurement of the force required to compress single foam particles to 0.1 of their initial diameter between parallel plates in an Instron testing apparatus. Particles having average diameters ranging from about 3.8 to 5.1 millimeters were compressed at a rate of about 12.7 millimeters per minute. After reaching full compression, the compressive load is removed for a period of about 30 seconds prior to again loading and compressing the particle to 0.1 of its initial diameter. Five cycles of such compression were employed and the results of such testing are set forth in Table XIV.

The particles after initial foaming were cooled to room temperature and permitted to remain overnight under normal atmospheric conditions, about 230C and one atmosphere absolute .The foam particles of each sample were then placed in 2.5 cm diameter by 15.2 cm long glass pressure tubes and subjected to a pressure of 450 kPa 50 psig of nitrogen at a temperature of 230C for a period of 24 hours. On release of the nitrogen pressure after the 24 hour period, the foam particles were placed on 57 millimeter aluminum weighing dishes which were subsequently placed in a preheated air oven for periods of one quarter, one half, one, three and five minutes respectively. The expansion ratios of the samples were measured by a buoyancy technique immediately after removal from the oven and also 24 hours after removal from the oven. No significant change was noted in the expansion ratio as determined from the particles immediately after removal from the ovens and 24 hours later.Expansion ratios for variable times after exposure to 1300C for samples of Table VII and compression values obtained in the manner hereinbefore described are set forth in Table XV.

The expanded particles were aged for 24 hours at room temperature and ambient air pressure.At the end of this period of time, portions of the samples were pressurized with 450 kPa 50 psig of nitrogen for a period of two days and two of the samples were pressurized with air at a pressure of 450 kPa 50 psig , for two days. The pressurized samples were exposed to 1300C air for varying periods of time and the expansion factor, that is the volume of foam over the volume of the initial solid, determined.

However, with the variation that 23 weight percent based on the weight of the monomer mixture of trichlorotrifluoroethane was dissolved in the monomer prior to dispersion in an aqueous solution containing 0.2 weight percent methyl cellulose as a suspending agent. The polymerization conditions employed were identical to those employed for Sample 8. The resultant polymer particles varied in diameter from about 0.4 to 1.6 millimeters and the swelling ratio in toluene was 34.8. The concentration of the trichlorotrifluoroethane in the polymerized particle was 19.1 percent based on the total weight of the particle. The primary foaming of the particles was accomplished by exposure to air at ambient pressure for varying periods of time.The results are set forth inTable XVII.

The side walls were tapered outwardly from the bottom at an angle of about 5 degrees to facilitate removal of the foam molding. The box had an open top measuring about 16.5 by 16.5 cm. The corners of the box were soldered together and a flat tubular heat exchange tube of copper tubing was soldered on the outside of the bottom of the box to thereby facilitate heating with steam or cooling with water. The bottom of The box was perforated with a plurality of holes having a diameter of abdut 0.71 mm inches spaced on 2.5 cm centers.A second box somewhat larger than the first box and sufficient to contain the first box with the heat exchange tubing was fabricated and provided with a 0.64 cm diameter vent tube soldered in The center of the bottom. The second box was placed over the heat exchanger and soldered into place. The purpose of The 0.64 cm diameter tube in the second box was to permit pressure reduction in the mold cavity during the molding process. A mold was completed by providing cover for the open side of both boxes provided with a rubber gasket having a thickness of about 0.32 cm, disposed in a groove about the perimeter of the mold to provide an effective seal. The mold is loosely filled with nitrogen or air pressurized expandable particles of density equal to about the density of the final molded product. To obtain a desired degree of interparticulate fusion, the ratio of the volume of the unconfined secondary foamed particle to the primary foamed particle should be equal to or greater than 2. When the mold has been filled, the cover was clamped in place and the particles heated either by means of steam under pressure or hot air.Optionally, such heating may be accomplished together with a reduction in the pressure within the mold, to increase particle expansion, improve surface appearance and improve the interparticulate particle fusion. When the desired degree of fusion has been obtained, heating is discontinued and the mold cooled by providing cold water within the heat exchange tubing. Atmospheric pressure is restored as necessary after cooling the mold and the molding removed. A plurality of polymer particles Sample 14 were prepared as described for the particles utilized in the example set forth in Table II. Spherical particles 1.53 millimeters in average diameter were impregnated with 17.1 weight percent of a 73 to 27 parts by weight mixture of dichlorodifluoromethane and trichlorotrifluoroethane. The particles were heated for a period of 7 1 2 minutes in an air oven at a temperature of 1300C to produce free flowing particles having an initial expansion factor of 100. These expanded particles were then pressurized for a period of 47 hours with 253 kPa 22 psig air and then placed in the mold to fill the cavity. The mold was closed 340 kPa 35 psig steam was passed through the heat exchange tube to raise the surface temperature within the mold to about 1250C.After heating about 2 minutes, the pressure within the mold cavity was reduced to 50 68 kPa 15 to 20 inches mercury absolute . The steam turned off and cooling water was applied for about 15 seconds. Pressure within the mold cavity was restored to atmospheric, the mold opened and the molded article removed. Inspection indicated excellent interparticulate fusion and the molding was resilient, the surface and dimensions of the mold cavity were faithfully reproduced and no post molding shrinkage was observed.The density of the molding was 4 kg m3 0.25 pcf . The procedure was repeated using identical polymer particles impregnated with a 70 to 30 weight percent mixture of dichlorodifluoromethane and trichlorofluoromethane to provide a total content of volatile blowing agent of 17.9 weight percent Sample 15 . The expandable particles were heated in air at a temperature of 1300C for 5 minutes to obtain initially expanded particles having expansion ratio of 72. These expanded particles were then pressurized with 355 kPa 37 psig air for 26 hours. At the end of this period, the mold was filled with the pressurized expanded particles, the cover clamped and the mold heated with 410 kPa 45 psig steam to a mold surface temperature of about 1300 to 1350C. The pressure within the mold was maintained at atmospheric pressure. Steam heating was maintained for three minutes after which cooling water was applied for one minute.On opening of the mold, the surface temperature was about 700C. The molded article had a density of about 7.4 kg m3 0.46 pcf . Excellent fusion of particles was obtained and the molding was resilient and tough. No shrinkage was observed and the dimensions and surface of the mold were faithfully reproduced. A second mold was constructed generally in accordance with the construction of the first with dimensions approximately 20 by 20 by 2.5 cm. The walls were perforated for direct introduction of steam into the mold cavity. A plurality of particles were prepared by the polymerization of styrene containing 0.04 weight percent divinylbenzene, 0.2 weight percent benzoylperoxide and 0.1 weight percent tertiary butylperoxybenzoate. Monomer droplets were of generally uniform size and obtained utilizing the orifice plate and monomer reservoir pulsed at about 500 cycles per second.Polymerization was carried out for 20 hours at 800C and for 10 additional hours at 900C. The particles were impregnated with a 90 to 10 by weight mixture of dichlorodi fluoromethane and trichlorotrifluoroethane while still in the aqueous suspension at a temperature of about 850C. The particles were separated from the suspension medium by filtering and drying in an air oven. The resultant particles contained a total volatile content of 14.9 weight percent Sample 16 . Portions of the beads were heated in 1300C air for 2 minutes to provide a foaming ratio of 73 and a bulk density of about 7.5 kg m3 0.47 pcf . The expanded beads were aged at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature for 20 hours prior to filling the mold cavity. The mold was closed. The steam at a pressure of 375 kPa 40 psig was introduced into the mold through perforations in the walls for 45 seconds 15 seconds elapsed until cooling water was applied for 15 seconds. The maximum molding temperature observed was 1170C. On removal of the molding from the mold, shrinkage and warpage were observed. The initial density of the molding when removed from the mold was 16.8 kg m3 1.05 pcf .The molding, aged in air at ambient temperature for 22 hours, expanded to a shape which faithfully reproduced that of the mold cavity with a density of 8 kg m3 0.5 pcf . Apparently such reduction in density and return to the configuration of the mold cavity is due to air permeation into the molding.Example 7 A plurality of particles of the lightly crosslinked styrene copolymer beads employed in the previous molding experiment were impregnated with an 0 20 by weight mixture of dichlorodifluoromethane and trichlorotrifluoromethane to provide expandable particles Sample 17 having a total volatile content of 17.7 weight percent. Impregnated particles were exposed to air at a temperature of 1300C for a period of 5 minutes.The foaming factor was 74 and the expanded particles had a foamed density of about 7.7 kg m3 0.48 pcf . The once expanded particles were then pressurized with 205 kPa 15 psig air for a period of 20 hours. The particles were then placed in the second mold. The mold and contents were then heated with 375 kPa 40 psig steam for 55 seconds to obtain a mold temperature of 1150C and then cooled with water for 15 seconds.The maximum temperature during the molding was 1160C and the maximum pressure in the mold was 260 kPa 23 psig . The molding exhibited some shrinkage with no warping. The initial density was 10.9 kg m3 0.68 pcf . The molding was aged under ambient atmospheric conditions for 19 hours whereupon the density became 8.0 kg m3 90.5 pcf . The foam molding reproduced the configuration of the mold well. No internal voids were apparent and fusion was very satisfactory. Example 8 Three moldings in accordance with the present invention were prepared and one molding in accordance with the conventional expandable polystyrene art. The four samples were evaluated. Cushioning characteristics by means of the American Society for Testing Materials procedure D1596 consists of dropping a series of known weights through known distances onto a pad of cushioning material of predetermined dimensions. An accelerometer attached to the weights detects the amount of shock encountered and translates into an electrical signal to an oscilloscope. The trace provides a signal indicative of the cushioning characteristics of the material. The data obtained by the American Society forTesting Materials procedure D1596 for dynamic cushioning indicates that the use of low density cushioning foams produced in accordance with The present invention saves raw materials and improves cushioning performance for shipment of light articles. Low density moldings prepared in accordance with the present invention exhibit less loss of thickness during repeated compressions than conventional 24 kg m3 1.5 pcf expandable polystyrene shaped moldings. Note Table XXI wherein various moldings have been compressed to 25 percent of their original thickness from 1 to 5 cycles.

A portion of the particles were added to the box. The 15.2 cm cube cubic weight was then added to the box and centrally positioned Therein and the remaining space within the box filled with the partially expanded foam particles having a bulk density of about 3.2 kg m3 0.2 pcf . The box was then closed and allowed to stand for a period of 24 hours duríng which time the partially reinflated particles expanded further to form a plurality of generally tesselated, generally spherical particles.The box and the weight were then subjected to a shake test wherein the box was vibrated at a frequency of about 4 1 2 half cycles per second with a 5.1 cm 2 inch displacement for a period of 30 minutes. On completion of the vibration or shake test, no change in position of the cube had occurred. Particles in accordance with the present invention provide a highly desirable loose fill dunnage for light fragile items. In a generally similar manner, reinflatable or partially reinflatable particles in accordance with the present invention provide a desirable loose fill thermal insulation which can be readily applied to wall cavities, cavities in cement block walls, and spaces between masonry walls, as thermal insulation. The partially inflated particles may be applied to such cavities and within a relatively few hours expand to add a generally continuous insulating body assuming that an adequate quantity of particles has been added.Example 10 A plurality of polymerizations were conducted employing a mixture prepared from 179.9 grams of styrene, 0.092 grams of a mixture of 77.9 weight percent divinylbenzene and 22.1 percent of ethylvinylbenzene 0.36 grams of benzoyl peroxide and 0.126 grams of tertiary butylperoxybenzoate. Into eight 15 cm by 1.9 cm diameter glass ampules were placed 22 grams of the styrene mixture together with about 7 weight percent of various blowing compositions. Each blowing composition was either a hydrocarbon, or the hydrocarbon plus 20 milligrams of water. Each ampule was sealed and heated in an upright position for 4 days at a temperature of about 800C and for an additional day at a temperature of about 1250C. Solid rods of polymer containing entrapped volatile blowing material were removed from the ampules after the ampules and polymer had been cooled to room temperature. The resultant polymer rods were separately ground into small particles and screened to obtain particles which passed through a 12 mesh screen and were retained on a 16 mesh screen, the screen apertures being about 1.68 and 1.19 millimeters, respectively. Portions of each sample were analyzed for volatile content and the difference in solubility parameters of the polymer and the organic blowing agent calculated.These values are set forth in Table XXII.

Foamed particles which had been exposed to 1300C air for a period of 3 minutes were cooled to room temperature and permitted to age at ambient temperature and air pressure for a period of 3 hours. After aging, the particles were subsequently pressurized with 450 kPa 50 psig air for 20 hours at room temperature.At the end of that time the pressure was reduced to atmospheric and the samples were immediately heated to 1300C in an air oven.

When expanded particles set forth in Table XXIII were repressurized with 305 kPa 30 psig after three hours at ambient temperature and pressure for a period of 20 hours and the particles again subjected to 1300C air for various periods of time, total expansion ratios as set forth in Table XXV were obtained.

The mixture was sealed into a 25.4 cm by 2.5 cm diameter glass ampule and heated for six days at a temperature of about 800C and an additional day at a temperature of 1250C. A solid clear rod of styrene polymer was removed from the ampule and ground into particles on a Wiley mill.The molecular weight of the copolymer as determined by gel permeation chromatography analysis was a number average molecular weight of 120,280 molecular weight units and a weight average molecular weight of 370,850. The calculated number of functional pendant hydroxyethyl groups is approximated by the weight average molecular weight divided by the moles of styrene multiplied by 104.14 divided by the number of moles of hydroxyethyl acrylate which gave a value of 3.1. The theoretical number for the crosslinking coefficient is about 1.6, if all the pendant hydroxyethyl were joined by a crosslinking reagent.However, the reaction is less than 100 percent efficient and the actual crosslink density is similar to that obtained by polymerizing styrene with 0.04 weight percent divinylbenzene using 0.2 weight percent benzoyl peroxide as the initiator at a temperature of 800C. Fifty grams of ground styrene hydroxyethyl acrylate polymer were milled for 8 minutes in a BrabenderPlasticorder prior to the addition of 0.176 gram of polymethylene polyphenylene isocyanate commercially available under the trade designation of Mondur MR.The temperature of the melt within the BrabenderPlasticorder at the time of addition of the Mondur MR was 1900C and the torque indication was 1150 meter grams. The resultant mixture was milled for an additional 9 minutes with the temperature of the melt increasing to 2030C and the torque increasing to about 1,390 meter grams. The polymer was removed from the mixer and molecular weight determined by gel permeation chromatography analysis. The number average molecular weight was 118,000 grams per mole and the weight average molecular weight was 474,000 grams per mole. The polymer was subsequently ground on a Wiley Mill and sieved to provide particles passing through a 3 millimeter opening and retained on a 1.5 millimeter screen opening.Particles of the resultant resin were then pressurized with blowing agent. A portion of 9.8 grams of polymer with 0.196 grams of Kaolinite and 5 cubic centimeters of 75 25 by weight mixture of dichlorodifluoromethane and trichlorofluoromethane with 0.1 gram of water was sealed in a glass ampule which was rotated end to end at 10 revolutions per minute for 66 hours at a temperature of about 800C. The water was added to the glass ampule prior to pressurization in order to crosslink the polymer and to aid in cell nucleation during foaming.On completion of the impregnation, the resultant polymer particles were analyzed for volatile fluid blowing agent content which was indicated to be 27.1 weight percent. Immersion of a portion of the particles in toluene for 24 hours indicated a swelling ratio of 29 at ambient room temperature. The expansion ratio of the blowing agent impregnated particles Sample 39 determined for varying periods of time was as follows ER After Indicated Time in Minutes at 1300C in Air 0.25 0.5 1 3 56 7.5 10 16 40 59 107 136 164 170The primary expansion of the particles was very good. A number of the particles which had undergone primary expansion to an expansion ratio of about 47.7 which had been foamed for a period of about 40 seconds at a temperature of 1300C in air were pressurized with 450 kPa 50 psig air for a period of 20 hours at ambient temperature Sample 40 . At the end of the 20 hours period, the particles were immediately heated to 1300C and foaming values determined after various periods of time as set forth below.

After the monomer mixture had been added to the amuple, it was sealed. The sealed ampule was Then placed in a water bath having a temperature of 800C. After three 3 days in the water bath the ampule was placed in an oven for a period of four 4 hours at a temperature of 1250C The ampule was cooled and broken to retrieve the polymer.The polymer was ground in a Wiley Mill employing a 6 millimeter sieve. The ground polymer was sieved and particles between about 1 and 2 millimeters in size were employed for foaming tests. The monomer compositions employed were, for sample 39, 50 grams of vinyl toluene and 0.1 gram of benzoyl peroxide for samples 40 and 41, 50 grams of vinyl toluene, 0.1 gram of benzyl peroxide and 0.028 gram of divinyl benzene which was 72 weight percent active. The samples were impregnated with blowing agent in the following manner 9.8 grams of polymer were dry blended with 0.2 gram of Ajax Jigger P clay obtained from Georgia Kaolin Company. The coated particles, together with 5 cubic centimeters of, blowing agent were placed in glass ampules and the ampules sealed. The sealed ampules were then rotated in a glycol water bath at two revolutions per minute. Upon removal from the water bath the ampules were cooled in dry ice and then broken to retrieve the polymer particles.The polymer particles were stored at a temperature of 200C prior to foaming. The blowing agent employed with samples 39 and 40 was a 3 to 1 by weight mixture of difiuorodichloroethane and trichlorofluoroethane.The polymer particles were exposed to the blowing agent mixture for 70 hours at a temperature of 25 C. Sample 41 was exposed to 100 percent dichlorodifluoroethane at a temperature of 500C for a period of 4 days. The samples 39, 40 and 41 were expanded or foamed employing a forced air oven. Primary expansion was carried out by placing the blowing agent impregnated particles in a 20.3 by 38 by 5.1 cm aluminum baking pan. Secondary expansion of the samples was done by placing the foamed particles into preheated 5.1 by 5.1 by 5.1 cm aluminum trays. The primary expansion results are set forth below.
