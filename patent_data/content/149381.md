# Method for driving a gas discharge display panel.

## Abstract
In a gas discharge display panel, first y ₁, y ₂,.., y m and second y ₁, y ₂,..., y m driving electrodes are capacitively coupled to each display electrode 5a, 5b,..., 5m x m on at least one of two substrates. The first and second driving electrodes of the display electrodes are formed by a first group of driving electrodes and a second group of driving electrodes by connecting the first and second driving electrodes as a plurality of groups. Specified display elec trodes are controlled by selecting the first and second electrodes at the same time. The method for driving the gas discharge display panel comprising the steps of discharg ing all dots in one selected line of the discharge electrodes which are to be written and erasing selected dots which are not to be written.
