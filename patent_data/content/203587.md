# RAS ONCOGENE PEPTIDES AND ANTIBODIES

## Abstract
Novel ras oncogene polypeptides derived from the C terminal variable region of different members of the p21ras protein family as well as monoclonal and polyclonal antibo dies specific to such region are described. Such antibodies are useful for immunometric assays for the determination of the presence of each individual member of the p21ras onco gen protein family or combination thereof.
