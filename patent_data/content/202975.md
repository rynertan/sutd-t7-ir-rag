## Description
The present invention is related to soluble interleukin 2 receptor IL 2R and a method of assaying the same. More particularly, the present invention is related to the discovery of soluble, IL 2R in human body fluid as a result of disturbed body function and a solid phase immunoaassay for quantitative determination thereof. The ligand interleukin 2 IL 2 and its receptor IL 2R In contrast to hormone mediated systems, cellular activation is a prerequisite for the induction of both the ligand IL 2 and its receptor IL 2R , the latter being expressed rapidly at the cell surface in a time dependent and heterogeneous manner When certain human cells are stimulated or otherwise activated, they manufacture and express newly synthesized molecules on their cell surfaces and also release these molecules in a soluble form. Hence, the detection of these molecules, which are not expressed by resting or unactivated cells, can serve as an indicator or footprint of cellular activation. As will be described more fully herein Heretofore, the measurement of IL 2 receptors IL 2R was limited to the assessment of cell associated IL 2R by a variety of immunological techniques, involving several monoclonal antibodies against the human IL 2R. The observation of a soluble or released form of this molecule has heretofore not been reported. Therefore, this soluble molecule has never been measured in a body fluid. Hence, the detection of a soluble IL 2R molecule in humans under certain conditions is a new discovery. With regard to cell associated IL 2R, the quantitative measurement of IL 2R has been accomplished by binding of the monoclonal antibody followed by cellular analysis wth a fluorescence activated cell sorter FACS or similar machine costing approximately 80,000 200,000 . Such an analysis provides information about the number of cells expressing receptor and the amount of antibody bound, but does not provide a quantitative estimate of the number of receptors. The latter can be accomplished with an assay using radiolabeled monoclonal of known specific activity. However, such tests are tedious and require radionuclides which pose problems of safety and disposal. In contrast, the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay ELISA of the present invention for IL 2R described in detail herein is quantitative, rapid, sensitive, inexpensive, and employs enzyme rather than radioactivity to detect IL 2R. The necessary reagents could be packed in a rather small box or kit and would have a shelf life of about one year. The instrument necessary to read the assay can be a simple spectrophotometer which is available in virtually every clinical hospital laboratory. In addition to the method described herein, this solid phase immunoassay has also been performed with alkaline phosphatase conjugated monoclonal antibody 7G7 B6 directly, instead of the FITC conjugated 7G7 B6 and alkaline phosphatase conjugated rabbit anti FITC. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a quantitative, rapid, sensitive and inexpensive method of determining IL 2R. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a solid phase immunoassay for quantitative determination of IL 2R. It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a monoclonal antibody having specific binding affinity for an epitope of IL 2R, said epitope being different from IL 2 binding site and from a heteroantibody binding site of the receptor. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a sandwich Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay ELISA for IL 2R. An additional object of the present invention is to provide a method for monitoring, detecting or screening such malignant, therapeutic, autoimmune, or pathophysiological states in humans of which soluble IL 2R level in the body fluid reflects an indicative index. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a kit containing various components of the present sandwich ELISA for detecting soluble IL 2R, particularly in human plasma or serum. Other objects and advantages will become apparent as the detailed description of the present invention proceeds. These and other objects, features and many of the attendant advantages of the invention will be better understood upon a reading of the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein These and other objects of the present invention are achieved by an inexpensive, rapid, sensitive and quantitative assay for detecting the presence of soluble IL 2 receptor in a sample, comprising a monoclonal antibody having specific binding affinity for an epitope of the receptor, said epitope being different from IL 2 binding site and from a heteroantibody binding site of the receptor. Although any materials and methods similar or equivalent to the materials and methods described hereunder can be used in the testing or practice of the present invention, the preferred materials and methods are now described. All publications mentioned hereunder are incorporated herein by reference. The HTLV 1 positive T cell leukemia line, HUT 102B2 was maintained Cytofluorometric analysis of the binding pattern of 7B7 B6 to both resting and activated PBMC was done by indirect immunofluoroscence utilizing a fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC conjugated F ab 2 fragment of a goat anti mouse IgG antibody N.L. Cappell Labs, Cochranville, PA following routine procedure. The competitive binding of 7G7 B6 or anti Tac to activated cells was assessed using biotinylated forms of the monoclonal antibody as described by The ability of IL 2 to block the binding of antibodies to activated cells was assessed by incubating 1x10⁶ PHA activated PBMC for 1 hour at 4 C in a final volume of 100 µl of various concentrations of immunoaffinity purified IL 2 About hundred million HUT 102B2 cells were washed once in methionine free RPMI 1640 NIH media unit containing 2 dialyzed FCS and resuspended at 10x10⁶ cells ml in the same media for 1 hour at 37 C. The cells were pelleted, resuspended at 1x10⁶ cells ml in the same media and pulsed with 250µ Ci ml of ³⁵S methionine 1315 Ci mmol, Amersham for 30 mins. The cells were pelleted and diluted to 2x10⁶ cells ml in RPMI 1640 containing excess 500 fold unlabeled methionine Gibco . Incubation of the cultures was continued and at intervals of 1,2,4,8, and 22 hours aliquots of 2x10⁷ cells were removed and diluted in a 10 fold volume of 4 C PBS containing 50 µg ml of cycloheximide Sigma . Each aliquot was pelleted and lysed in the same manner as those cells undergoing surface radiolabelling. Prior to immunoprecipitation with 7G7 B6 or anti Tac samples were first precleared with anti HLA. Anti HLA, 7G7 B6 and anti Tac immunoprecipitates were analyzed on SDS polyacrylamide gels as above. For the ELISA to detect soluble IL 2R, alternate rows of the inner 60 wells of Immulon 1 flat bottomed 96 well microtiter plates Dynatech were coated overnight with 150 µl of purified anti Tac at 1 µl ml in carbonate buffer pH.9.6 or carbonate buffer alone as a background control. It should be noted here that a heteroantibody, such as a rabbit anti IL2 receptor antibody, can also be used in place of anti Tac. In fact, the use of heteroantibody provides a more comprehensive and desirable assay. After washing, 100 µl of various dilutions of samples was added to the coated and control wells, incubated for 2 hours, washed, an 100 µl of a 1 4,000 dilution of FITC conjugated 7G7 B6 in phosphate buffered saline containing 1 FCS added to all the wells. After two hours additional incubation, the plates were washed and 100 µl of a 1 1,000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase conjugated rabbit anti FITC was added. After a one hour incubation, the plates were washed, 100 µl of p nitrophenyl phosphate Sigma 1 mg ml added, and the absorbance of the wells determined after 30 mins. at 405 nM using a Titertek ELISA reader Flow Laboratories . The ELISA for IgM was performed as described by As shown in Fig. 3 the results indicated that IL 2R was measurable in cell associated and cell free supernatants from an IL 2 dependent human T cell line stimulated with IL 2 at a cell concentration of 1x10⁵ cells ml and harvested four days later when the cell concentration was 1x10⁶ cells ml. Various dilutions of culture supernatant or detergent extracted cells were analyzed by ELISA and the absorbance at 405 nM plotted against the number of cells from which the supernatant and cell extract were derived. As shown in Fig. 3 both supernatant and cell associated IL 2R could be detected above background levels at cell numbers as low as 6x10⁴ and 3x10⁴ ml, respectively. In order to ascertain that the supernatant material was indeed a soluble form of the IL 2R, this supernatant was passed thru a 0.22 micron Millipore filter and also ultracentrifuged for 100,000 x G for 1 hour. Neither procedure diminished the amount of IL 2R detected in the supernatant. To establish the specificity of the ELISA for soluble IL 2R, culture supernatants from PBMC activated for 12 days with PWM were analyzed for IL 2R and IgM. The data in Table 1 show that the absorbance in uncoated wells receiving sample and either FITC anti IgM or FITC 7G7 B6 second antibody plus alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti FITC third antibody was very low. Wells coated with heteroantibody which then received sample and FITC 7G7 B6 but not FITC anti IgM , followed by third antibody, were strongly positive. Wells coated with anti IgM which received sample, FITC anti IgM but not FITC 7G7 B6 , and third antibody, were also atrongly positive. Those wells that were coated with anti IgM which received sample, FITC 7G7 B6, and third antibody or those wells coated with heteroantibody which received sample FITC anti IgM, and third antibody had adsorbance comparable to uncoated wells. These results establish that this assay is specific for the molecule bound by 7G7 B6 and heteroantibody. As shown in Fig. 4 A B, supernatant and cell associated IL 2R are generated early and with rapid accumulation in those cultures stimulated with PHA or OKT3 while the increase in cultures stimulated with tetanus toxoid and alogeneic cells was more gradual. In addition, cellular and soluble IL 2R generated in response to antigen activation at the time points tested was somewhat less than that produced in response to PHA and OKT3 stimulation. Since cell associated IL 2R expression has been shown to require Because HTLV I infected T cell lines constitutively express cell surface IL 2R The soluble IL 2R from an IL 2 dependent T cell line analyzed by Sephadex G 20 gel filtration Fig. 6 appears to be relatively uniform in size with a molecular weight somewhat smaller than albumin. To better define the molecular weight of the soluble IL 2R, immunoaffinity purified soluble IL 2R from HUT 102B2 cells was analyzed by NaDodSO₄ PAGE. Fig. 7 shows that the soluble IL 2R migrated as a single broad band of apparent molecular weight Mr 40,000. The term sandwich ELISA or sandwich assay as used herein means that at least two antibodies or reactive fragments thereof having different binding sites on IL 2R are used as if the receptor were sandwiched between these two antibodies. These antibodies could either be both monoclonal or one monoclonal and the other a heteroantibody polyclonal or both could be heteroantibody. As shown in Fig. 1, rabbit anti human IL 2 receptor antibody is diluted to a desired concentration 1 to 1,200 in carbonate buffer pH 9.6 and 150 µl added to the wells of alternate columns of the inner 60 wells of Immulon 1 flat bottomed 96 well microtiter plates Dynatech . The alternate wells of the plate receive carbonate buffer alone. Following overnight or longer incubation at 4 C, the wells are washed with buffer phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 containing 0.05 tween and sodium azide , and various dilutions of the sample to be analyzed are applied to the coated and non coated wells. The diluent consists of phosphate buffered saline containing tween, azide, and 1 fetal calf serum or other protein source diluent . A reference preparation of soluble IL 2 receptors is also added to the coated and non coated wells. Following a two hour incubation at room temperature, the plates are washed with buffer PBS with tween and azide as above and 100 µl of a 1 1,000 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC conjugated monoclonal antibody 7G7 B6 is added and the plates incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Following this incubation, the plates are washed and 100 µl of alkaline phosphatase conjugated rabbit anti FITC iluted 1 1,000 in diluent is added. After a 1 hour incubation, the plates are washed and 100 µl of a solution of p nitro phenylphosphate PNPP, Sigma, 1 mg ml substrate in diethanolamine buffer pH 9.8 is added to the wells. The conversion of substrate PNPP to produce PNP is determined by absorbance at 405 nM in the experimental coated and control uncoated wells and the latter subtracted from the experimental wells. The specific product produced in the experimental wells is then related to that produced in the standard wells and the amount of IL 2R present in an unknown sample is determined from the readings obtained for various known levels of IL 2R. It should be noted that the preferred embodiment of the method described, Some alternatives to the method include The demonstration herein that the release or expression of IL 2R is associated with immune activation makes it now possible to monitor the cell associated and soluble IL 2R in various body fluids as a sensitive test of altered states of immune activation, such as occurs in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosis, for example. The ELISA test of the present invention can be valuable to predict when disease exacerbations are about to occur and or in monitoring immunosuppressive therapy. In a similar way determination of IL 2R in the serum of individuals rejecting allografted kidneys, livers and the like would allow monitoring graft rejection and titrating immunosuppressive therapy. The demonstration of elevated serum levels of IL 2R in association with certain malignancies as shown in Fig. 2, establishes that an analysis of cells and serum from certain patients with such cancers is a useful diagnostic means for detecting and or monitoring initial or residual tumor burden. It should be noted that the present sensitive assay for IL 2R also enables the dosage of IL 2R administered to humans to be monitored much as the serum levels of pharmaceuticals are checked. Since the present test for soluble IL 2R requires hybridoma derived monoclonal antibodies which can be produced in large quantities, the quantities of reagents needed is no longer a problem. Mice costing approximately 10 each injected with the hybridoma cells, would generate enough reagents for the performance of roughly 50,000 tests making it obviously quite inexpensive. The performance of this test as an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay ELISA requires no radioisotopes and the reagents are stable over a period of about one year, which are significant advantages of the present invention. It is understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and tha various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and the scope of the appended claims.
