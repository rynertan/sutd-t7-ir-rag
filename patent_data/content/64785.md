# Method and arrangement for internally coating a tube by reactive deposition from a gas mixture activated by a plasma.

## Abstract
Tubes, consisting of an electrically insulating material such as SiOâ‚‚ are internally coated by reactive deposition from a gas mixture passing through the tube. The deposition is activated by a plasma in the tube reciprocally moving along the tube. The plasma 6 is formed in the tube 1 by high frequency electric energy capacitively applied to the gas phase by means of two flames which impinge upon the outside of the tube at two longitudinally spaced sites. The sites are reciprocally moved along the tube during the reactive deposition. A high frequency generator 7 is electri cally connected to the burners 4,5 generating the flames. An apparatus for coating tubes comprises a gas supply system 2 , burners for generating a plasma and means for moving the burners.
