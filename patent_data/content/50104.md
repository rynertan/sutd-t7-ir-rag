# A DEVICE IN CORE BARRELS

## Abstract
A device in core drilling for indicating when a core barrel placed in a rotatable hollow drill rod is no longer capable of receiving a further quantity of reamed out core material includes a valve which at said condition of the barrel constricts the passage for flushing medium flowing between the core barrel and the bore of the drill rod so that a readable flushing medium pressure increase occurs. The valve closes off said passge incompletely to allow a minor quantity of flushing medium to be taken to the drill bit mounted at the bottom of the drill rod, thereby to prevent said drill bit from being burnt out.
