# TUNED VIBRATION DETECTOR

## Abstract
This invention comprises a vibration sensor for detect ing engine knock. The sensor has a tuning mechanism which is mechanically resonant with a preselected vibrational frequency. The resonating movements of this tuning mechanism are adapted to apply varying stress to an associated magnetostrictive element. A magnetic biasing element imparts a magnetization to the magnetostrictive element and a detecting means is associated with the magnetostrictive element for detecting changes in the magnetization caused by the varying applied stress.
