# Drive circuits for driving digital circuits with a clock signal.

## Abstract
A drive circuit comprises output transistors Q₁₃, Q₁₄ of complementary type serially coupled to each other between voltage supply terminals B, B . auxiliary transistors Q₁₆, Q₁₇ of complementary type which have base electrodes respectively connected to the serial connection point be tween the output transistors Q₁₃, Q₁₄ and which are serially coupled between the respective base electrodes of the output transistors Q₁₃, Q₁₄ , and resistors R₁₂, R₁₃ serially coupled between the voltage supply terminals B, B with their connection point coupled to the connection point of the auxiliary transistors Q₁₅, Q₁₆ , an input clock signal being supplied to the respective base electrodes of the output transistors Q₁₃, Q₁₄ via coupling capacitors C₁₁, C₁₃ .
