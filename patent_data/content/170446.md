# Methods of assay.

## Abstract
In its broadest aspect, the present invention provides a method of effecting an electrochemical specific binding assay of a ligand, either qualitatively or quantitatively, in an apparatus comprising at least one electrode, in which method a labelled component of the assay medium is, at least in part, magnetically held in the vicinity of the electrode. The electrochemical assay method may include a separation step, whereby bound label may be separated from free label in the assay medium. Preferably the electrochemical assay method will include the step of determining a perturbation in an electrochemical characteristic of components of the assay medium associated with a ligand complexing reaction. Such an assay method is applicable to, for example, antibodies and antigens and suitable labels include redox centres, enzyme labels in the presence of an electron transfer mediator and electron transfer mediator labels in the presence of an electron donor or acceptor.
