## Description
TITLE OF INVENTION Compound and Composition for Therapeutic or DiagnosticUse and a Process for Therapeutic Treatment. The present invention relates to compounds and compositions which are useful for therapeutic treatment of infections as well as profylaxis and diagnosis in connection therewith. The invention also relates to a process for therapeutic treatment of mammals including man. The technique of the invention is applicable to patogenic microorganisms of different types, particularly patogenic bacteria, such as gram positive cocci, for example streptococci, pneumococci and staphylococci. The invention is in particular related to applications directed to streptococci, such as S. pneumoniae. A large number of bacterial infections arise by bacterial attack on mucous membranes. In the initial part of the course of infection it is essential to the bacterium to be able to bind to epithelium cells. The infectious capacity of bacteria is therefore often directly related to the ability of the bacteria to adhere to epithelium cells. S. pneumoniae is a bacterium which is a frequent cause of ear disorders and sinusitis. The bacterium is present in the flora of healty nasopharynx and is often cause to inflammation of the middle ear. Studies have shown that adherence of S.pneumoniae to epithelium cells is due to glycoconjugates receptors, and the present invention has for an object to provide a composition or compound having the ability of replacing the normal receptor function in vivo and in vitro in relation to patogenic bacteria prone to provide disorders in human and animals due to the bacteria. Another object of the invention is to provide a composition or a compound which can be used diagnostically or which can form the basis for a process for therapeutic or profylactic treatment of mammals including man. Another object of the invention is tQ provide a process for identification and or quantifica tion of receptor structures of biological materials from manmals including man. Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process for isolating and purifying bacteria or acceptor structures of bacteria. The invention is particularly directed to receptor structures for 5. pneumoniae, but the invention is not limited to this particular bacteria. By studies and experiments it has been found that the receptor for S. pneumoniae contains a structural element having the formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 and R2 independently are hydrogen or carbohydrate residue and R3 is hydrogen , lower alkyl or a carbohydrate residue, whereby h may constitute the residue of a natural or synthetic glycoconjugate, and wherein R4 is hydrogen and R5 is acetyl or R4 and R5 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a cyclic imide, where by R1 is other than a lactose residue or derivative thereof. In structural formula I R1, R2 and R4 all have the meaning of hydrogen in a preferred embodiment. R5 is suitably acetyl. In regard to substituent R this may be of any type 3 as long as it does not adversely effect the conditions in connection with applying the invention. Preferred meanings of R3 is methyl or a carbohydrate residue, but R3 may also be the residue of a natural or synthetic glycoconjugate, the compound of the invention thus being a glycoconjugate.The technique concerning the preparation of such glycoconjugates is well developed see for example references 19 and 20 . It is preferred that OR3 is in ss configuration. In regard to the meaning of R4 and R5 it is preferred that these substituents together with the nitrogen to whi they are attached form an imide, for example phthalimide. The invention thus provides for compounds or compositions which are useful as inhibitors for the adherence of pneumococci to human pharyngeal epithelium cells. The active substances according to the present invention can be formulated for use in human or veterinary medicine for therapeutic, profylactic, or diagnostic use.In clinical application the active constituents are normally administered orally or rectally or by injection in the form of a pharmaceutical preparation containing the active constituents in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which may be solid, semi solid or liquid, or as a capsule, and such preparations constitute a further aspect of the invention.The compounds may also be used as such without carriers or in the form of an aqueous solution for external use, such as rinsing liquids or for injection. As examples of pharmaceutical preparations there may be mentioned tablets, drops, solutions and suppositories. Usually, the active substance constitutes 0.05 to 99 pereent by weight of the preparation, for example from 0.1 to 50 pereent for preparations for oral administration. To prepare pharmaceutical preparations in the form of dosage units for oral application containing a compound according to the invention the active con stftuenta may be admixed with a solid, pulverulent or other carrier, for example lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, manna toll starch, such as potato starch, corn starch, amylopectine, a cellulose derivative or gelatine and may also comprise lubricants, such as magnesium or calcium stearate, or polyethylene glycol waxes compressed to form tablets or cores for drawees, By using several layers of the active drug separated by slowly dissolving layers tablets with delayed release are obtained. Liquid preparations for oral applications may be in the form of elixir, syrups or suspensions, for example solutions containing from 0.1 to 20 percent by weight of active substance, sugar and a mixture of ethanol, water, glycerol, propylene, glycol and optionally other additives of a conventional nature. The dose by which the active constituents are administered can vary within broad limits and depends on different factors, such as the seriousness of the disorder, age and weight of the patient and can be individually adjusted. As a conceivable range for the amount of active constituents that may be administered per day there may be mentioned from O 1 to 2000 mg or from 1 mg to 2000 mg. In accordance with the invention it has been found that compounds of formula 1 as defined above have the ability of inhibiting the adherence of bacteria to humane pharyngeal epithelium cells. Since such adherence in many cases is an essential requisite for the disorders caused by the bacteria these compounds and the corresponding pharmaceutical preparations are useful in therapeutic and or prophylactic treatment for the purpose of effecting the adherence of the bacteria. The particular compounds described in the following are with some exceptions all known as such and can be prepared in accordance with known processes. However, the compounds have not previously been described as possessing properties which would make tEm medicinally useful. The invention also relates to a process for therapeutic treatment of mammals including man, an active amount of the composition or a compound in accordance with the invention being administered to the mammal. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a compound or composition which can be used for identification and or quantification of the receptor structure in question in biological materials or for purifying bacteria or their acceptor structures. The composition contains one or several structural elements according to the invention above or according to the patent claims covalently or in another manner associated to for example a macromolecular carrier, optionally via a coupling arm. Useful carriers can be synthetic or naturally occurring polypeptides, polysaccharides or other types of polymers or particles. In practice the arm between structural element and macromolecular carrier can be any of the following EMI5.1 S 2 nS R wherein R is an alkyl or aryl residue Ref. 21 . According to yet another aspect of the invention there is provided a process for determining the presence of pneu nococci in a sample taken from an animal including man. This process is based on the technique of determining the degree of interaction between the bacteria of the sample and a compound or composition in accordance with the present invention.Such interaction may be determined by inhibition or induction of the adherence of the bacteria to cells or other surfaces. In the above examples n may vary between 1 and 20. The invention will in the following be further described by nonlimiting examples.Bacteria. Two strains of S.

Binding to humane nasopharyngeal epithelium cells was investigated in vitro as previously described Ref. 3 . Bacterial cells 109 ml and pharyngeal epithelium cells from a hyalthy male donor 104 ml were mixed, centrifugated at 1500xg for 10 minutes and incubated at 370 C for 30 minutes. After washing twice in 2.5 ml salines for separating epithelium cells from non adhering bacteria the number of bacteria adhering at 40 epithelium cells were counted and the average number per cell was determined. Haemagglutination. Binding to cells other than epithelium cells can facilitate identification of components taking part in adherence phenomena. Bacteria binding to erythrocytes result in haemagglutination. The ability of adhering pneumococci to agglutinate erythrocytes was investigated.Newly drained citratized blood was washed and 5 suspensions in saline of humane, bovine, rabbit and guinea pig erythrocytes were prepared. Humane 0 , A , B , AB and umbillical cord blood tests were supplied by the blood back, Sahlgrenska Hospital, Gothenburgh,Sweden. For enzymatic treatment the suspensions were admixed with Papain Kebo Grave, Stockholm, Sweden or neuramidase SIGMA, St. Louis, MO, USA till a final concentration of 1 mgZml and was rotated at 370C for 30 minutes. After washing twice the suspension was again adjusted to 5 , Bacterial and erythrocyte suspensions 25 l of each were admixed on a slide and agglutionation was read visually.Screening in regard to receptor activity of glycoconJugates. The receptor activity of glycoconjugates or isolated or synthetic oligosaccharides was investigated in two principally different ways.1. Inhibition of binding by excess of free receptor. For inhibition of adhesion the bacterium concentra tion giving an average adhesion value of 20 300 bacteria per cell was determined. This inoculate was then preincubated with dilutions of the solutions of potential receptor activity for 15 minutes at 37 C. Epithelium cells were added and adhesion testing was carried out as described. The adhesion was given in percent of the saline as a control sample.2. Induction of binding by coating with a receptor. Association of receptor active glycolipids with epithelium cells or erythrocytes can increase binding to epithelium cells already containing the receptor or induce binding of cells which have not previously contained receptor. Rabbit erythrocytes 100 ul of a 5 ffi suspension were mixed with a neolactotetraosyl ceramide, sialylneolactotetra osylceramide or globotetraosylceramide 5OO ul of suspensions of 200 ugAml and incubated at 370 for 3 hours with rotation Ref. 16 . After elimination of unbound glycolipid by repeated washing the erythrocyte concentration was again adjusted to 5 and used for haemagglutination.Parallel to the tests regarding inhibition of adherence the humane nasopharyngeal epithelium cells were pretreated with decreasing concentrations of glycolipid, incubated for 2 hours at 370C, washed and used for testing of adherence.RESULTSThe neo lactose series of glycolipids. The receptor activity of the glycolipids is shown in table II. Pretreatment of the pneumococci with neolactotetraosylceramide inhibited adherence 59 of the saline as a control at 200 pg ml . Sialylneolactotetraosylceramide showed no effect table II . Coating of pharyngeal epithelium cells with 200 pg ml of neolactotetraosylceramide increased adherence table III , while sialylneolactotetraosylceramide or globotetraosylceramide showed no effect at the same concentration. The structural differences between said compounds is clear from table I.Oligosaccharides. From the natural occurring oligosaccharides tested neolactotetraose and lactotetraose were the best inhibitors with a concentration approximately 400 pg ml for 50 inhibition of adherence of 109 pneumococci table III . The octasaccharide from humane urine had no effect. N acetyl lactose amine and a methyl N acetyl lactose amine were inactive wheras ss methyl N acetyl lactose amine inhibited adherence at a concentration of about 5 mg ml.A number of synthetic oligosaccharides and derivatives were tested for determining receptor specificity. The results are presented in table IV.The results show that the active receptor function is essentially derived from the disaccharide GlcNAcss1 3Gal . common to both lacto N and lacto N neo tetraos see substances 5, 6 and 16 of tables III and IV . GlcNAcssl 4Galss O Me was inactive table IV . In the present disclosure the nomenclature recommended by IUPAC IUB has been used Refs. 17 and 18 .
