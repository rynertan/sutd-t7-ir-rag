## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION MAGNETIC RECORDING DISC AND PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTIONTHEREOFFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a magnetic recording disc, and more particularly to a magnetic recording disc suitable for a high density recording disc and process for the production thereof.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In order to accomplish recording with a high track density on a magnetic recording disc, in other words, to make the recording tracks narrow, it is necessary to use such a magnetic recording disc having an isotropic magnetic characteristic in circumferential direction of the magnetic recording disc with a good S N ratio. However, it has been almost impossible for magnetic recording discs produced by any known processes to record with a high track density up to 200 recording tracks per inch of 3 inch diameter magnetic recording disc for example. In order to obtain a recording disc having a highS N ratio and an isotropic magnetic characteristic in a circumferential direction, improvement is usually directed to the substrate layer or magnetic layer, since the magnetic recording disc is basically formed by these layers. As to the characteristic of the substrate, from the view point of providing a magnetic recording disc with an isotropic characteristic relative to the circumferental direction, it is preferred to use such a material that an isotropic characteristic is excluded so that the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the co efficient of thermal expansion relative to the surface direction is lower than 8 x 10 6 C 1, In a case where the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the co efficient of thermal expansion is greater than 8 x lO boC I the lsotropy of the magnetic recording disc is lowered, whereby a high track density can not be expected As to the characteristic of the magnetic layer, from the view point of improving S N ratio, it is preferred to use such magnetic material having a high flux saturationBr and coercive force lic. However, in order to increase the output with an equal linear recording density, residual magnetic flux density Br must be great. In addition, it is also preferred to provide the magnetic layer above an undercoating layer. The present inventors experimentally prepared a magnetic recording disc by coating the magnetic layer above an undercoating layer. The magnetic recording disc formed as above showed a high output level but there occurred a great output fiuctuation and modulation noise. As the result of the study by the inventors about the problems described above, it has been found that the degree of the output fluctuation and the modulation noise depend on the characteristic of the undercoating layer rather than the characteristic of the substrate or magnetic layer. The undercoating layer is provided for the purposes of 1. increasing the bonding force between the substrate and the magnetic layer 2. preventing undesired effects to the magnetic layer from small projections and recesses on the surface of the substrate, fish eye, oriyomer or filler 3. decreasing surface electric resistance and optical permeability. To accomplish the items 1 and 2 it is sufficient to provide the undercoating layer made of resin material or mixture of a resin material and a cross linking agent with a desired thickness. However, in order to accomplish the purpose of the item 3, it is necessary to mix electrical conductive powder into the undercoating layer and in this case there occurs the problem of the output fluctuation and modulation noise. According to the known process, the undercoating layer is formed by coating the coating material in which electric conductive powder is dispersed within resin solution then being dried under a high temperature for volatizing the solution. According to the conventional process of making the coating layer, it has been believes that the undercoating layer should be as thin as possible by the reason described below, In a mechanical coating process, stress caused by coating force occurs not only on the coating layer but on the undercoating layer. Therefore, the undercoating layer must resist against the stress. In a case where the undercoating layer is thicker than a predetermined value, the undercoating layer is deformed by the stress of the coating force due to flexibility of the undercoating layer. On the contrary, i order to form a thin undercoating layer, the coating material must have a low viscosity. Therefore, in the prior art, the coating material was prepared by solving the solid material having a relatively low density in a great amount of the solvent for lowering the viscosity of the coating material. In fact, in the Japanese Patent Publication unexamined of 150129 1973, it is described that the density of the resin solution including electric conductive powder for the undercoating layer is 1 through 10 so as to provide a thin undercoating layer. However, in a case where the undercoating layer is formed by such a coating material or iow viscosity shows various disadvantages described below 1. It is very difficult to uniforr.ly disperse the primary grain of the electric conductive powder in the resin material, therefore, the powder is undesirably dispersed in the form of a relatively large secondary grain with unevenness, whereby there liLay occur voids in the coated layer formed by the coating material as ascribed above with conductive powder dispersed. 2. In a case where the density of the coating material is relatively low with a great amount of the solution, there tends to occur a large amount of voids due to vaporization of the solvent by dry in addition to the voids occurred by the reason or the above item 1, whereby the flatness of the surface of the magnetic recording disc is undesirably harmed. When the magnetic layer is coated on the undercoating layer having the voids, the magnetic material enters into the voids, thereby forming unevenness in either the thickness of the magnetic layer and the distribution density of the magnetic material caused by the voids which are distributed ununiformly in the undercoating layer, thereby resulting in an output fluctuation, 2. furthermore, the solvent contained ln the magnetic coating material is solved and entered in the undercoating layer partly because the voids enlarge the surface area of the undercoating layer, whereby the undercoating layer is partly solved and the resin material of the undercoating layer is entered in the magnetic layer, resulting in change of the component of the magnetic coating composition, and in turn causing the density of the magnetic material of the magnetic coating layer to be ununiform, and in turn resulting in increase of the moaulation noise. Through the analysis of the known magnetic recording disc as described above, the inventors have discovered the following fact that the main reason of the output fluctuation of the prior art magnetic recording disc is not caused by the thickness ol the undercoating layer but is caused by either the voids in the undercoating layer and the ununifcrm surface of the undercoating layer. Thus it has been discovered that a magnetic recording disc having a uniform flatness of the surface without the voids in the undercoating layer can effectively prevent the output fluctuation and modulation noise. It has been further discovered by the present inventors that the greater the thickness of the undercoating layer, the greater the rate of the increment or the residual magnetic flux density Br, thereby resulting in increment of the output. In addition, the greater the thickness of the undercoating layer, the smaller the effect of the unevenness, fish eye and the origomer filler of the surface of the substrate and the surface resistivity and optical permeability of the magnetic recording disc can be effectively decreased.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An essential object of the present invention is to provide a magnetic recording disc which is possible to form recording tracks with a high density. Another object of the present invention is to provide a magnetic recording disc having a high S N ratio with a small fluctuation or the output and a low modulation noise. A further object of the present invention is to provide a magnetic recording disc having a isotropic magnetic characteristic in the circumferential direction. In one aspect of the magnetic recording disc according to the present invention, a flexible substrate of non magnetic material is coated by a undercoating layer of 1.0 through 10 micron meters with a surface roughness of lower than 0.035 micronmeters composed or electrically conductive powder and polyurethane resin including a cross linking agent and the undercoating layer is coated with a magnetic layer having magnetic powder dispersed in bonding material The density o the solid composition of the coating material of the undercoating layer may be higher than 10 , preferably than 20 and the thickness of the undercoating layer is 1.0 micronmeter through 10 micronmeters, preferably 1.0 through 3.0 microrsteters. The recording medium formed in the manner described above may be subjected to a calendering process so as to eliminate the voids in the undercoating layer for obtaining the surface roughness lower than 0.030 micronmeters. By employing the mixture of a polyurethane resin and a cross linking agent as the resin material of the undercoating layer, it can be prevented that the undercoating material is solved and entered in the magnetic layer at the coating process of the magnetic layer. In the magnetic recording disc tormed by the methods as described above with the high output magnetic layers of the residual magnetic flux density Br higher than 900 gauss, a small output fluctuation and a low modulation noise with high S N ratio can be accomplished.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT In one specific aspect of the magnetic recording disc according to the present invention, the material for the flexible substrate is not limited, various composition, for examples, such as polyethylene terephtharate polyester group such as polyethylene 2 or 6 naphtharate polyolefine group such as polyethylene or polypropylene cellulose acetate such as cellulose triacetate, cellulose diacetate, polyimide and or polyamide can be used as the substrate.Preferably, the thickness of the substrate may be in a range of 10 through 100 micronmeters. As the electrical conductive material of the undercoating layer, carbon powder such as carbon black, graphite, carbonblack with graphite layer metal or metallic alloy such as silver, cupper, tin, alminium, Zinc, chromium and or titanium can be used by selecting at ieast one of them with a possible diameter of the grain. Preferably, carbon black, more particularly MOGUL L having a grain diameter 24 mili micron, oil absorption 60 CC 100g, DBP surfadce area 138 m2 g sold by Cabot Corporation in U.S.A.is used. As polyurethane resin, polyether polyurethane bearing at its terminal, at least one of an isocyanate group and a hydroxyl group may be used. As the specific example of the polyurethane resin, TAKENATE M 407 sold Dy TakedaChemical Industries Co., SPANDEX T 5250 or T 5201 sold byDAINIPPON INK AND CHEMICALS, INC. or DESMOFEN 1200 sold byBayer Ltd.. may be used. As the specific examples oi the isocianate compounds for the cross linking agent, DESNODUR L sold by Bayer Ltd. or CORONATE L sold by NIPPON POLYURETHANECO. may be used. Preferably, the polyurethane resin and the magnetic powder are mixed by the ratio of 10 90 by weight , more preferably 10 80 through 70 30 and turther more preferably 40 60 through 60 40. The resin material as described above and magnetic powder are mixed to provide coating material by a dispersing machine such as ball mill, sand mill or pebble mill with at least any one of the solvent such as toluene, xylene, MEK, MINK, cycrohexanon, aceton, THF, ethyl acetate, DMF. The coating material may be coated by a knife coater, gravure roll coater or reverse roll coater. A specific attention should be paid for the density of the coating material so that the solid component of the coating material should be in the range higher than 10 . After the coating material is coated on the substrate for making the undercoating layer, the calendering process may be performed on the undercoating layer if necessary. As to the magnetic layer to be formed on the undercoating layer thus formed, the shape of the magnetic powder may be acicular or grain metallic iron powder, metallic cobalt powder other alloy powder Y r E e,03 powder, Foe304 powder or intermediate oxide or cobalt doped magnetic particle thereof may be used. In particular the cobalt doped magnetic oxided iron particle is preferred. In addition, the magnetic powder having a saturation magnetization 6 of greater than 60 emu g with a coercive force Sc of greater than 200 Oe is preferably used. Specific examples of the binder to bind the magnetic powder to the substrate are a polyvinyl chloride resin, a polyvinyl acetate resin, a copolymer of vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate, a copolymer of vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate and vinyl alcohol, a polyurethane resin, a cellulose type resin, a polyester resin ana its sulfonate, a copolymer of vinylidene chloride and acrylonitrile, a copolymer of acrylonitrile and butadiene, an isoprene rubber, a butadiene rubber and their mixtures. The binder optionally contains a cross linking agent e.g. a isocyanate compound having a low molecular weight and further a fatty acid, a fatty acid ester, a hydrocarbon type lubricant, fluorine containing lubricant, a silicone type lubricant. In order to form the magnetic layer, the magnetic coating material is prepared using the magnetic powder as described above with the binder resin and suitable adding agent and the solvent as described with rererence to the material of the undercoating layer, then coated on the undercoating layer in a similar process. It is noted for producing the magnetic recording disc having a magnetic isotropic characteristic in the circumferential direction to make the magnetic orientation of the magnetic powder isotropic at the time of coating the magnetic layer on the undercoating layer. In a case where the magnetic recording discs are shaped by punching after the undercoating layer and magnetic layer are formed on the substrate, preferably, the process of magnetic orientation against the magnetic powder is omitted or the random orientation is performed at the time of punching. In a case where shaping into the disc form is performed by the punching process before the magnetic layer is coated on the undercoating layer, preferably the orientation process may be performed by so called spin coating method.A calendering process may be performed without causing any problem after coating and or drying the magnetic layer. In a case where the magnetic layers are formed on both sides of the disc, preferably the undercoating layers are formed on both sides of the substrate first and in turn the both of the magnetic layers may be formed on the both undercoating layers simultaneously rather than finishing one side first then finishing another side for avoiding curling of the disc. In this case, it is most desired to perform the calendering process for each of the undercoating layers when the undercoating is finished.
