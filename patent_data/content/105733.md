# Connecting device with a heat recoverable metal driver member.

## Abstract
A connecting device 10 includes a socket member 12 having at least two tines 18 , the tines 18 having an unstrained configuration from which at least one of the tines 10 can be resiliently deformed away from the other tines 18 to define a socket for receiving and holding a substrate, and a band of heat recoverable metal 14 defining a driver member which in its martensitic phase loosely surrounds the tines 18 so that at least one of the tines 18 can be resiliently deformed outwardly when defining the socket member without deforming the driver member 14 . The driver member when warmed to a temperature at which the metal is in its austenitic phase, recovers inwardly and exerts a supplementary inward force on the tines 18 . In the martensitic phase of the metal, the tines 18 alone hold the substrate within the socket with sufficient force to provide a physical connection.
