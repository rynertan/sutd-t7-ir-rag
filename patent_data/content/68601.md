# Drilling fluids containing an additive composition.

## Abstract
Aqueous drilling fluids containing a minor amount of an additive composition featuring mono and diesters of C₁₂ C₅₀ aliphatic hydrocarbon substituted succinic acids or anhydrides, such as octadecenyl succinic anhydride with thio bis alkanols such as dithiodiethanol. Such fluids are especially useful where reduced torque drilling fluids are needed. Another embodiment of this invention re lates to a method of drilling utilizing the above described fluids.
