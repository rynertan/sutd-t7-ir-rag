# Process for drying a chelating agent.

## Abstract
A process is described for reducing the volume of a liquid waste containing an organic amine chelating agent in which a finely atomized spray of the liquid waste is contac ted with a gas stream having a temperature in excess of the thermal decomposition temperature of the chelating agent. The proportions of the hot gas stream and liquid waste are controlled to rapidly evaporate water from the liquid waste and cool the gas to a temperature below the decomposition temperature of the chelating agent in a time of less than about 6 seconds to product a dry, flowable powder product including the chelating agent.
