# Rapidly soluble sweetener, process for its preparation and beverage mix employing it.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a rapidly soluble sweet ener, a process for preparing it, and improved dry beverage mixes employing it. The composition preferably comprises from 15 to 65 fructose, from 15 to 30 of low dextrose equivalence dextri nized starch, and from 30 to 65 sucrose, on a dry solids ba sis. By preparing it with a density of 0.4 or less, solubility is greatly enhanced over prior art sweeteners, especially su crose. Because of the improved solubility, carbonation is not lost by requiring stirring of a sweetener when preparing a beverage from a dry carbonated beverage mix.
