# A programming controller for a controller for electrical circuit systems and apparatus.

## Abstract
In or for a controller for electrical circuit systems and apparatus, which controller is programmable with logic instructions representative of circuit nodes of a ladder diagram, a control system for wire number programming a ladder diagram. The control system comprises a manual panel 2 into which may be plugged a read write memory M having a series of plural bit data storage locations. A plurality of selector switches F1S, F2S, F3S are provided and are settable to encode a contract program including the input wire number to a contact, the contact number and the output wire number from the contact, or the input wire number to an output element and the output element number. Manually controlled entry control means are provided at 14, 8, 12 being operable to store the input wire number code, contact number code and output wire number code or input wire number code, a special code indicative of an output program and the output element code in successive storage locations in the memory.
