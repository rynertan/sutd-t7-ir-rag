An end cap 18 for use with a conveyor roll 12 of the thermally low expansive ceramic type used to convey hot glass sheets includes a metal sleeve 20 that receives an end 16 of the roll to provide rotational support and or driving and also includes a retention spring 22 interposed between and engaged with both the roll end and the sleeve in order to retain the sleeve on the roll. The retention spring 22 preferably includes a plurality of leaf springs 44 that are sufficiently deflected at room temperature so as to remain partially deflected upon heating in order to provide the end cap retention.
