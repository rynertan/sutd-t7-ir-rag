## Description
FLVORINATED PYRROLIDONE DERIVRIVES AND THEIR UTILITY AS HERBICIDES Backqround of the Invention The present invention relates to certain fluorinated derivatives of N substituted pyrrolidones which have been found to be particularly useful as pre and postemergent herbicides against weeds of various types, and to their method of application. Herbicides are widely used by farmers, ccmnercial agricultural companies, and other entities in order to increase crop yields for such staple crops as corn, soybeans, rice, and the like, and to eliminate weed growth along highways, railroad riqhts of way, and other areas. Herbicides are effective in killinq or controlling unwanted weeds which compete for soil nutrients with the crop plants, and by reason of the fact that they kill weeds, are responsible for improving the esthetic appearance of highway and railroad riqhts of way. There are a number of different types of herbicides presently sold catmercially, and these fall into two general cateqories. The categories are pre emergence and postamerqence herbicides. The pre ememence herbicides are normally incorporated into or applied to the soil prior to the emergence of the weed plants from the soil, and the post emerqent herbicides are normally applied to plant surfaces after emergence of the weeds or other unwanted plants from the soil. Sonle herbicides are broad based and will kill not only weeds but crop plants too. Other herbicides are selective and are effective against weeds but are substantially inactive against certain crop plants. Prior Art Aromatic N substituted halo 2Syrrolidones have been disclosed to be useful as herbicides, as shown in U.S. Patent 4,110,105, Teach, issued August 29, 1978. The afore mentioned pyrrolidone compounds have been described to be effective pre emergence and post emergence herbicides against such undesirable grasses and weeds such as crabqrass, foxtail, watergrass, and wild oats, among others. Efforts are constantly beinq made, however, to find ccwouncls which are equal to or greater in effectiveness than presently existing pounds, or which are more economical to produce, or which are more selective toward various crop plants. Description of the Invention It has now been discovered that certain new and novel derivatives of the afore mentioned pyrrolidones described in U.S. Patent 4,110,105, have good herbicidal and plant growth regulating activity, particularly when used against weed species such as foxtail, wild oats, velvetleaf, mustard, and the like, as will be shown in greater detail herein. Moreover, they are possessed of aood selectivity toward grain crops such as wheat, rice, and barley. As used herein, the term herbicide means a compound or oarrrxr sition which controls or modifies the growth of plants. By the term herbicidally effective amount is meant any amount of such compound or composition which causes a modifying effect upon the grooth of plants. By plants is meant qerminant seeds, emerging seedlings and established vegetation, including roots and above qround portions. Such controlling or modifying effects include all deviations from natural developnent, such as killing, retarding, defoliation, dessication, regulation, stuntinq, tillering, leaf burn, dwarfing and the like. The term selectivity as used herein refers to the capacity of the herbicide to be effective in controlling or modifying the growth of weed pests, yet not be harmful to specific crop plants. A method of controlling undesirable vegetation of the present invention comprises applying an herbicidally effective amount of the can pounds described herein to the area or locus where control is desired. The new and novel compounds of this invention have the formula EMI3.1 wherein X is selected fran the group consisting of trifluoromethyl, chlorine, or cyano. Representative compounds falling within the scope of the formula as set forth above include, among others, N 3 cyanc 4 fluorophenyl 3 chloro 4 chloromethyl 2 pyrrolidone, N 3 trifluoromethyl 4 fluorophenyl 3 chloro 4 dlorcmethyl 2 pyrrol idone and N 3 chloro 4 fluorthenyl 3 chloro 4 chloromethyl 2 pyrrolidone and the like. mese compounds can be produced by treating a suitable aniline with dichloro acetylchloride followed by alkylation of the resulting acetanilide and cyclization with a transition metal catalyst. This procedure is illustrated in Examples 1, 2 and 3 below. EXAMPLE 1 Presaration of N 3 cyano 4 fluorophenyl 3 chloro 4 chloromethyl 2 pyrrolidone A 250 milliliter ml three necked round bottomed flask was obtained and equipped with a heatina mantle, a magnetic stirrer, a reflux condenser, a nitroqen at here and a thermometer. Into the flask was placed 6.25 grams q 0.0218 mole of N allyl N 3 cyano 4 fluorophenyl dichloroaoetamide dissolved in 70 ml of toluene. Next, 0.77 g 0.008 mole of diGbutylamine was pipetted into the solution followed by the addition of 0.11 g 0.0011 mole of cuprous chloride.The resultinq solution was heated slowly to 90 C. The solution was maintained at this tem perature for 3 hours then cooled to roam temperature, washed to times with 100 ml of water and concentrated in vacuo to qive 3.0 g 71.4 of a dark brown, viscous oil, which was identified by standard analytical techniques as being the subject compound. EXAMPLE 2Preparation of N 3 tri fluoromethvl 4 fluorohenvl 3hloro 4 chloro methyl 2 pyrrol idone 4.3 q 9.8 millimoles lem of N allyl4 3 trifluoromethyl 4 fluorophenyl dichloroacetainide dissolved in 50 ml of toluene was placed into a 100 ml three necked, round bottomed flask equipped with a heating mantle, magnetic stirrer, thermometer and ref fluxed condenser. In addition, 48 mq 0.49 mM of cuprous chloride and 0.45 ml 2.7 mM of diN butylamine were added to the solution, and the contents were then heated with stirring to 90 95 C. After two hours the reaction was complete.The reaction mixture was cooled to roam temperature, washed three times with 25 ml portions of aqueous HCl, dried over magnesium sulfate, and solvent stripped in vacuo to give a dark oil which was identified by standard analytical techniques as being the subject compound. EXAMPLE 3Preparation of N 3 chloro 4 fluorophenvl 3 chloro 4 chlorooethyl 2 pyrrolidone A 100 ml three necked, round bottom flask equipped with a heating mantle, magnetic stirrer, thermometer and reflux condenser was obtained. Into this flask were placed 24.97 q 0.084 mole of N allyl N 3chloro 4 fluorophenyl dichloroacetamide dissolved in 100 ml of toluene, 41.6 ml 0.064 mM of cuprous chloride, and 3.89 ml 0.023 mole of din butylamine. Tne solution was heated to approximately 90 95 C and maintained at that temperature for approximately 3 hours. Thereafter, it was cooled to room temperature and washed with three times 50 cc of 3 acxueous hydrochloric acid, dried over magnesium sulfate, and the solvent removed in vacuo to qive Ã…a dark oil that partially crystallized upon standing overnight. This material was subjected to column chranatoqraphy in a column of silica qel and a 1 1 ratio of ethyl acetate to hexane. A dark oil was recovered which was dissolved in 40 ml of cyclohexane. After standinq over the weekend the solution was filtered to afford 7.21 g of pinkish yellow crystals. Analytical techniques demonstrated that the product was as indicated above. Similar techniques can be used to produce the other compounds of the invention which in essence require dissolvinq the starting compounds in a solvent, and achieving rearrangement with the use of cuprous chloride and N dibutylamine. The preferred compound for use in the practice of the invention is N 3 trifluoromethyl 4 fluorphenyl 3 chloro 4 chloromethyl 2 pyrroli done. This compound has been found to have especially aood herbicidal activit y against weeds of various types when applied as pre emergent and postemergent herbicide and is selective to rice, wheat, corn and sorghum. EXAMPLE 4 Herbicidal Activity Tests This example offers herbicidal activity test data to show the effectiveness of the pyrrolidone compounds of the invention. The effect is observed by comparing the extent of weed control in test flats treated with the compounds against that occurrinq in similar control flats. The soil used in these tests was a sandy loan soil fran the Livermore,California area. Also added to the soil was 17 17 17 fertilizer N 2205 K2O on a weight basis , amounting to 50 pan by weight with respect to the soil and 100 pFm Captan, a soil funaicide. The treated soil was then placed in flats which were 3 inches deep, 6 inches wide, and 10 inches longs. The soil was tainped and leveled with a row marker to impress six rows across the width of the flat. The test weeds were as follows COMA NAME SCIENTIFIC NAME AERBroadleaf Weeds A. annual morningalory Ipomea purpurea AMG B. cocklebur Xanthium sp.

The flats were then placed in a greenhouse maintained at 70 to 85 F 21 to 30 C and watered daily by sprinkler. In the case of pre emergent testing the herbicide was incorporated into the soil Drier to planting of the seeds, at a rate equivalent to the indicated amounts in the Table. In post emergent testinq chemical application is made by spray ing 12 days after planting. The spray solution is prepared by dissolvinq 60 mq of herbicide c und in 20 ml of acetone containing 1 TweenR 20 polyoxysorbitan manolaurate , then addinq 20 ml of water to the resulting solution. The solution is sprayed at 80 gallon acre, resultinq in a 4 lb acre rate of chemical application. Other rates were achieved by varyins the solution concentration and or the rate of spray. In both instances, either pre or Post emergent testing, approximately 12 14 days after treatment, the degree of weed control was estimated and recorded as percentage control compared to the qrowth of the same species in an untreated check flat of the same ague. The rating scale ranges fran 0 to 100 , where 0 equals no effect with plant qrowth equal to the untreated control, and 100 equals complete kill. The results are listed in the Tables below. It will be noted that the carmounds of this invention are effective pre and post emergent herbicides against a wide variety of weed pests, but are selective to, i.e., essentially harmless aqainst, orass crop plants such as wheat, rice, sorghum and the like.

The canpositions are generally erabodied in formulations suitable for convenient aplication. Typical formulations contain additional ingredients or diluent carriers which are either inert or active. Exam ples of such ingredients or carriers are water, organic solvents, dust carriers, granular carriers, surface active agents, oil and water, wateroil emulsions, wetting agents, dispersirr aaents, and emulsifying agents.The herbicidal formulations qenerally take the form of dusts, emulsifiable concentrates, qranules ard pellets, or microcarssules. A. DUSTS Dusts are dense powder compositions which are intended for application in dry form. Dusts are characterized by their free flowinq and rapid settling properties so that they are not readily windborne to areas where their presence is not desired. They contain primarily an active material and a dense, free flowing, solid carrier Their performance is sanetimes aided by the inclusion of a wetting agent, and convenience in manufacture frequently demands the inclusion of an inert, absorptive grinding aid. For the dui4ns of this invention, the inert carrier may be either of vegetable or mineral oriqin, the wettinq aqent is preferably anionic or nonionic, and suitable absorptive grinding aids are of mineral oriqin. Suitable classes of inert solid carriers for use in the dust compositions are those organic or inorganic powders which possess hiqh bulk density and are very free flowinq. They are also characterized by low surface area and poor liquid absorptivity. Suitable qrindinq aids are natural clays, diatanaceous earths, and synthetic mineral fillers derived from silica or silicate. Amonq ionic and nonionic wettinq aqents, the most suitable are the members of the qroup know to the art as wettirn agents and emulsifiers. Although solid agents are preferred because of ease of incorporation, some liquid nonionic agents are also suitable in the dust formulations. Preferred dust carriers are micaceous talcs, pyro, yllite, dense kaolin clays, tobacco dust and ground calcium phosphate rock. Preferred grinding aids are attapulgite clay, diatomaceous silica, synthetic fine silica and synthetic calcium and maqnesium silicates. Most preferred wetting aqents are alkylbenzene and alkyl naphthalene sulfonates, sulfated fatty alcohols, amines or acid amides, lonq chain acid esters of sodium isothionate, esters of sodium sulfosuccinate, sulfated or sulfonated fatty acid esters, petroleum sulfonates, sulfonated vegetable oils, and ditertiary acetylenic glycols. Preferred dispersants are methyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, liqnin sulfonates, polymeric alkylnapnthalene sulfonates, sodium naphthalenesulfonate, polymethylene bisnaphthalenesulfonate, and sodium N methyl long chain acid taurates. The inert solid carriers in the dusts of this invention are usually present in concentrations of from about 30 to 90 weight percent of the total composition. The qrindinq aid will usually constitute 5 to 50 weight percent of the coopositions, and the wetting anent will constitute frail about 0 to 1.0 weight percent of the composition. Dust compositions can also contain other surfactants such as dispersing agents in concentrations of up to about 0.5 weiqht percent, and minor amounts of anticaking and antistatic agents. The particle size of the carrier is usually in the range of 30 to 50 microns.B. ELuLSIFIABLE CCNCENTES Emulsifiable concentrates are usually solutions of the active materials in nonwater niscible solvents together with an emulsifying agent. Prior to use, the concentrate is diluted with water to form a suspended emulsion of solvent droplets. Typical solvents for use in emulsifiable concentrates include weed oils, chlorinated hydrocarbons, and nonwatermiscible ethers, esters, and ketones. Typical emulsifyinq aqents are anionic or nonionic surfactants, or mixtures of the two. Examples include long chain alkyl or mercaptan polyethoxy alcohols, alkylaryl polyethoxy alcohols, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene ethers with sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene qlycol esters with fatty or rosin acids, fatty alkylol amide condensates, calciun and amine salts of fatty alcohol sulfates, oil soluble petroleum sulfonates, or preferably mixtures of these emulsifyinq aqents. Such emulsifying aqents will comprise fran about 1 to 10 weiqht percent of the total composition. Thus, emulsifiable concentrates of the present invention will consist of from about 15 to about 50 weight percent active material, about 40 to 82 weiqht percent solvent, and about 1 to 10 weight percent emulsifier. Other additives such as spreading agents and stickers can also be included.C. gANUIES AND PELLETS Granules and pellets are physically stable, particulate canposicompositions containing the active ingredients adhering to or distributed through a basic matrix of a coherent, inert carrier with microscopic dimensions. A typical particle is about 1 to 2 millimeters in diameter. Surfactants are often present to aid in leachinq of the active ingredient from the qranule or pellet. The carrier is preferably of mineral criqin, and generally falls within one of tw types. me first are porous, absorotive, preformed granules, such as preformed and screened arar.ular attapulq ite or heat expanded, aranular, screened venniculite. On either of these, a solution of the active agent can be sprayed and will be absorbed at concentrations up to 25 weight percent of the total weiqht. The second, which are also suitable for pellets, are initially powdered kaolin clays, hydrated attapulgite, or bentonite clays in size form of sodium, calcium, or maqnesium bentonites.Water soluble salts, such as sodium salts, may also be present to aid in the disintegration of granules or pellets in the presence of moisture. These ingredients are blended with the active components to give mixtures that are granulated or pelleted, followed by drying, to yield formulations with the active component distributed uniformly throughout the mass. Such granules and pellets can also be made with 25 to 30 weight percent active component, but more frequently a concentration of about 10 weight percent is desired for optimun distribution. The sran ular compositions of this invention are most useful in a size ranqe of 1530 mesh. The surfactant is generally a cannon wetting agent of anionic or nonionic character. me most suitable wetting agents depend upon the type of granule used. When preformed granules are sprayed with active material in liquid form the most suitable wetting vents are nonionic, liquid wetters miscible with the solvent. These are compounds most generally known in the art as emulsifiers, and comprise alkylaryl polyether alcohols, alkyl polyether alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyethylene qlycol esters with fatty or rosin acids, fatty alkylol amide condensates, oil solution petroleum or vegetable oil sulfonates, or mixtures of these.Such agents will usually comprise up to about 5 weight percent of the total composition. When the active inqredient is first mixed with a powdered carrier and subsequently granulated, or pelleted, liquid nonionic wetters can still be used, but it is usually preferable to incorporate at the mixing stage one of the solid, powdered anionic wetting agents such as those previously listed for the wettable powders. Such aqents will comprise from about 0 to 2 weight percent of the total composition. Thus, the preferred granular or pelleted formulations of this invention canprise about 5 to 30 percent by weight active material, about O to 5 weight percent wetting agent, and about 65 to 95 weight percent inert material carrier, as these terms are used herein.D. MICRCAPSULS Microcapsules consist of fully enclosed droplets or granules containing the active materials, in which the enclosing material is an inert porous membrane, arranged to allow escape of the enclosed materials to the surrounding mediun at controlled rates over a specified period.Encapsulated droplets are typically about 1 to 50 microns in diameter. The enclosed liquid typically constitutes about 50 to 95 of the weight of the entire capsule, and may contain a small amount of solvent in addition to the active materials. Encapsulated granules are characterized by porous membranes sealing the openings of the granule carrier pores, trapping the liquid containing the active components inside for controlled release. A typical granule size ranges from 1 millimeter to 1 centimeter in diameter. In agricultural useaqe, the granule size is generally about 1 to 2 ml in diameter. Granules formed by extrusion, agglaneration, or prilling are useful in the present invention as well as materials in their naturally occurring form. Examples of such carriers are vermiculite, sintered clay granules, kaolin, attapulqite clay, sawdust, and qranular carbon. Useful encapsulating materials include natural and synthetic rubbers, cell ulosic materials, styrene butadiene copolymers, polyacrylonitriles, polyacrylates, polyesters, pclyamides, polyurethanes, and starch xanthates.E. IN GENERAL Each of the above formulations can be prepared as a packaqe containing the herbicide together with the other ingredients of the formulation diluents, emulsifiers, surfactants, etc. . The formulations can also be prepared by a tank mix method, in which the ingredients are obtained separately and combined at the grower site. In general, any conventional method of application can be used. The locus of application can be soil, seeds, seedlinqs, or the actual plants, as well as flooded fields. Dusts and liquid compositions can be applied by the use of powder dusters, boan and hand sprayers, and spray dusters.The compositions can also be applied from airplanes as dusts and sprays because they are effective in very low dosages. In order to modify or control the growth of germinating seeds or emerginq seedlings, as a typical example, the dust and liquid compositions are applied to the soil accordinq to conventional methods and are distributed in the soil to a depth of at least one half inch below the soil surface. It is not necessary that the phytotoxic compositions be admixed with the soil particles.Instead, these compositions can be applied merely by spraying or sprinkling the surface of the soil. The phytotoxic compositions of this invention can also be applied by addition to irrigation water supplied to the field to be treated. This method of application permits the penetration of the compositions into the soil as the water is abscrbed therein. Dust compositions, granular compositions or liquid formulations applied to the surface of the soil can be distributed below the surface of the soil by conventional means such as discinq, draqginq or mixing operations. The herbicide compositions can also be applied to the soil through irrigation systems. According to this technique, the compositions are added directly to irrigation water umnediately prior to irriaation of the field. This technique is applicable in all aeoaraPr. cal areas reqardless of rainfall, since it permits supplementation of the natural rainfall at critical stages of plant growth. In a typical application, the concentration of the herbicide composition in the irritation water will ranqe from about 10 to 150 parts per million by weight. The irriqation water can be applied by the use of sprinkler systems, surface furrows, or floodinq. Such application is most effectively done before the weeds germinate, either early in the spring prior to germination or within tm days after cultivation of the field. The amount of the present composition which constitutes a herbicidally effective amount depends upon the nature of the seeds or plants to be controlled. The rate of application of active ingredient varies from about 0.01 to about 50 pounds per acre, preferably about 0.1 to about 25 pounds per acre with the actual amount depending on the overall cost and the desired results. It will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art that coopositions exhibiting lower herbicidal activity will require a higher dosage than more active compounds for the same degree of control.
