# A dental apparatus with a number of dental instruments connected to a common control circuit and a common operator unit.

## Abstract
In a dental apparatus, in which a number of instruments 19 to 22 are connected to a common control circuit 23 which is further connected with a common operator unit 17 having a control member, which is planar movable out of a home position, auxiliary functions related to the instrument op eration such as control of coolant composition and energiza tion of an air blow may be energized by the means of the com mon operator unit 17 by actuating the control member there of with a movement different from the instrument energizing movement. The energizing movement for an auxiliary function may have another direction than the instrument energizing movement, for example perpendicular thereto in the home po sition of the control member. In an embodiment in which a cer tain minimum duration is prescribed for the instrument energiz ing movement an auxiliary function may be carried out by a movement of shorter duration. The two possibilites may be combined so that also in case of a different direction related to the instrument energizing movement a discrimination may be made between actuation of auxiliary functions of a shorter or longer duration for the purpose for example of stepwise con rol of an auxiliary function.
