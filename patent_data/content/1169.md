# Surfboard harness and towing attachment.

## Abstract
A harness device for attaching a towing line 17 to a surfboard 20 has an automatic release mechanism which operates to disconnect the surfboard from the line if the surfboards should turn over or become inclined to the length of the line by more than a predetermined threshold angle. The automatic release mechanism includes an enlarged head 18 , for example, spherical or cylindrical, which is lodged into a coupling socket 14 in the underside of the board, the socket having a narrow mouth or lip 15 behind which the head lodges if the inclination of the line to the general plane of the surfboard is sufficiently small, while allowing the head to disengage from the socket if this inclination increases to an angle beyond the threshold inclination. Handles joined to the towing line may also be incorporated into the harness.

## Description
Surfboard Harness Towing Attachment The present invention relates to a surfboard ha ness and towing attachment device which makes it possible for t surfboard to be towec safely behind a towing vessel. Although water ski ing is very popular it is unavailable as sport to many people as it requiies the use of a very powerful boat in order to raw the s ier through the water because it is only the planing effect of tte ski or skis on the water which maintains the skier on the surface and less a certain niinirnum speed. is maintained the skier sinks. In t .is sport the tow boat is equipped with a towing line provided at its free end with a gripping handle. The skis the nselves are attached by suitable bindings to the feet of the wearer. The skis are not usually buoyant, and certainly do not provide sufficient flotation for the skier when static in the water. It may be, therefore, that if a skier loses his or her balance and is forced to release the towing line he or she may De in some difficulty until the towing boat returns. The sport of surfing has become very popular recently but suffers from the disadvantage that suitable wave conditions are not available at all times, nor at very many locations and cannot be enjoyed on inland waterways, lakes or reservoirs. It is the primary object of the present invention to permit greater utilisation of a surfboard, which is a relatively expensive item. Another object of the present invention is to provide an attachment device for connecting a towing line to a surfboard. A further object ot the invention is to provide a safety attachment device for connecting a towing line to a surfboard so that should the rider fall from the surfboard the latter will not continue to be towed behind the towing boat since it could then turn upwide down or sideways and snake on the surface of the water or, more dangerously, beneath the water. In order to achieve these and other objects which will become apparent from the following description, the invention provides an attachment device for com ecting a towing line to a surboard comprising means defining a socket like recess on a surface of said surfboard enlarged head means on the coupling end of said towing line said socket like recess on said surface of said surfboard being shaped to permit driving. engagement oi said enlarged head means tlierein for towing said surfboard with said line, the shape of said socket like recess defining an angular threshold between said towing line and the general plane of said surface of said surfboard beyond which driving engagement of said enlarged head is broken and automatic release of said coupling takes place, Should the rider fall off and the board turn over, any tendency for the board to dive or swing so that its general plane becomes substantially inclined to the line o action of the towing line, the attachment will release automatically. preferably the attachment includes an enlarged head which may be formed on or attachable to a towing line and is engageable in an undercut socket like recess formed by an insert element in the bottom of the surfboard. InEMI2.1 simple embodiment the attachment head is a substantially spherical ball secured to the end of the line, although in a preferred embodiment the attachment head is a substantially cylindrical rigid cu2 like member. The present invention also comprehends a surfboard adapted for receiving bn attachment as defined above, in which the undersurS bce of the board has an undercut recess for receiving the enlared head either at the front or nose end of the board or at the point spaced from the front or nose end of the board, either or. the upper face or the lower face thereof.In one embodiment the socket like recess h.s a spring clip operable as 8 detent to retain the enlarged head in the socket when fitted therein, but the fcrce of which can be overcome to allow the heaci to be released if the angle of inclination of the towing line increases to a value greater than the said angular threshold, although in the preferred embodiment release of the head is effected when a substantially cylindrical head is brought within a range of positions in which it is sufficiently nearly aligned with the axis of the socket to be pulled through a circular mouth opening thereof by the tension in the line. In a simple case the enlarged head may simply be a figure of eight knot which is lodged in the undercut recess in the board when the connection is made. This, however, is not the preferred arrangement since a knot in the line might foul against the spring clip thereby preventing proper release, and almost certainly would not turn within the undercut socket like recess with the facility required to ensure free and easy movement. device formed as on embodiment of the present invention thus permits a surfboard to be toned behind a boat two enable a rider to gain experience of standing on the board in circumstances where there is not adequste surf for practice in the usual manner and for lengths of time greater than can usually be experienced when riding waves which are nec ssarily of limited duration. Because the surfboard has sufficient bucyancy to supFort the rider it is riot necessary to tow the surfboard as fast as conventional water skis which rely on the planing effect to maintain the rider above the surface. Moreover, because of this flotation a sur board offers less resistance to movement than conventional water skis so that a boat of very much lower power can be useu and never theless achieve a satisfactory ride. For improving balance, particularly for inexperienced users, the present invention also provides a harness attachable to a surfboard for towing purposes, incorporating an attachment for correcting towing line to given point on the surfboard and at least one branch line having a handle which can be held by a rider on the surfboard. There may further be provided a spreader between the towing line and the branch line such that, in use, the branch line can be held approximately parallel to that section or the towing line between its junction with the branch line and the attachment device for connection to the surfboard.Thus, although the branch line may be relatively short, the direction of the forCe exerted on the hand of a user can nevertheless be in approximately the same direction as if the handles were attached to a towing line directly. This avoids any tendency for a downward pull on the user, and because of the tensioner, the user by leaning backvards, and applying pressure with his feet, can release the tension in that section of the towing line between its junction with the branch line and the connection to the surfboard so that the surfboard is in facet being displaced by the friction force exerted through the feet of the user.This simulates water ski ing to a greater extent since the traction is transmitted through the handle held by the rider. Embodiments without the spreader bar have a greater adaptability since the continuity of the line, either from the boat to the surfboard attachment, or from the boat to the handle, can be changed silrfiply by changing the relative tensions on each by pulling more or less hard on the handle. Further features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a study of the following description in which reference is m3de to the accompanying drawings, which are provided rurely by way of non restrictive example. Figure 1 is a sectional view of part of a surfboard showing the attachment of a towing line thereto Figure 2 is a diagrammatic view of a surfboard harness formed as an embodiment of the present invention Figure 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating an alternative form of harness and Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of a modified form of coupling device. Referring now to Figure 1, there is shown a section of a surfboard comprising an upper waterproof skin 11, a cellular filling 12 and a lower waterproof skin 13. In the lo er face of the surfbc srd is a recess, generally indicated 14 which has an undercut wall 15 and a communicating slot 16. h towing line such as tiiat illustrated 17 having at the free end thereof a ball 18 is connected to the. surfboard by inserting the ball i8 into the recess 14 and positionnng the towing line 17 in the communicating slot lb. A detent string 19 is carried on one wall oi the recess 14 to assist in retaining the toing ball in position when the line 17 is slack. In use of the device illustrated a surfboard may be towed by the towing line 17 and while a rider is standing or sitting on the surfboard his weight and balance maintains the surfboard in an upright orientation so that the tension applied along the lines 17 maintains the ball 18 in contact with the undercut wall 15 of the recess 14 so that the traction can be transmitted to the surfboard. If the line 17 is slack the ball 18 is nevertheless retained in the recess 14 by the spring 19. If the rider should fall off the surfboard, however, there is no risk that the surfboard could turn sideways or upside down, or could snake from side to side causing a danger since the tow ball 18 will be released from the recess 14 when the inclination of the line 17 reaches the angle illustrated in broken outline inFigure 1 thereby releasing the towing line from the surfboard. In Figure 2 the full harness for use in riding 8 surfboard behind a tow boat is illustrated. In Figure 2 the surfboard is generally indicated 20 and it can be seen that the attachment ball 18 in the recess 14 is positioned between one quarter and one third of the length of the surfboard from the forward end thereof. Attached some distance from the attachment ball 18 along the line 17 is a branch line 21 which is held spaced from the towing line 17 by a light spreader bar 22 rigidly connected to the towing line 17 and the branch line 21 at two points 23, 24 respectively.The branch line is provided with a junction block 25 from which lead two hand lines 26, 27 to the free ends of which are attached respective handles 28, 29 to be gripped by a user standing on the surfboaru. In use of the harness the user may merely stand on the surfboard and allow himself to be towed solely by the tension in the line 17, riding the sur,board using balance only in the some way as when surfing except that the two handles 28, 29 will be held loosely. They may, alteracively, be discarded if required.The handles 28, 29 are useful, however, in assisting balance since a light tension can be applied to them for this purpose.Alternatively, by pressing forwardly with the feet, a user can transfer the tension from the towing line 17 entirely to the branch line 21 so that that section of the towing line 17 between the coupling ball 18 and the junction with the branch line 21 is slack. In these circumstances the towing line 17 from the boat to its junction with the branch line 21 is raised to be approximately in line with the branch line 21. Referring now to Figure 4 the embodiment shown comprises an insert element 31 which is incorporated into the bottom of a surfboard when the board is being made.The element comprises two generally parallel circular flange portions 32, 33 the latter of which has a circular hole 34 therein. Joining the two parallel circular flange portions 32, J 3 is a substantially cylindricalbody portion 35 which is closed at one end by the transverse flange portion 32 and which is joined to the other circular flange portion 33 which has the circular opening 34 by a substantially conical wall portion 56. When incorporated in the body of a surfboard the flange 33 with the opening 34 is mounted flush with the bottom surface of the board and the projection of the flange 32 provides a security against the socket 31 being ripped out of the board by any forces which may be applied thereto during use. The enlarged hesd means which cooperates ith the socketlike recess 31 is in the form c,t d substantially cylindrical body 37 having a transverse closure wall 38 with the small opening 39 therein through which passes the line 17, a knot 40 being tied at the end to retain the line L7 within the interior of the enlarged head member 37. h shoulder 41 is formed adjacent the open end 42 of the enlarged head member to provide a portion 43 of reduced diameter for.assisting in locating the head member in the opening 34 in the socket since the cylindrical portion 37 thereof has substantially the same diameter as the diameter of the hole 34. In use of the device the enlarged head 37 is located in the opening 34 and pushed through, being a sliding fit therein. Once within the interior of the socket like recess the enlarged head end 37 does not pull out through the opening 34 since it is not, except in special circumstances aligned with this opening and towing engagement between the surfboard and the line 17 iS thus effected. Moreover, the surfboard can be positioned facing in any direction with respect to the line 17 providing the angle between the line 17 and the general plane of the surfboard remains below a bredetermined threshold value.If, on the other hand, the rider should fall off the surfboard and this start to paravane, that is turn broadside on to the towing direction, the conical surface 36 guides the enlarged head 37 into the mouth of the opening 34 and the slight resilience of the lips of the mouth 34 allow the enlarged head 37 to be pulled through the opening releasing the towing connection. Figure 3 illustrates an alternative form of harness incorporating the attachment device illustrated in Figure 4, a single handle 40 is attached by a handle line 41 to a towing line 42 with a 2soft or knotted connection which gives greater flexibility in use since the handle 40 can be pulled tightly, in which case the line from the towing boat to the handle 40 is tactically straight, or tension can be released to an extent such that the line 42 is practically straight from the towing boat to the surfboard 20.
