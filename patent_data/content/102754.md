# Process for reclamation of high purity selenium, tellurium, and arsenic from scrap alloys.

## Abstract
This invention is generally directed to an improved process for reclaiming metallic elements in high purity from a source material containing these elements, which compris es providing a source material, converting the source material to mixture of oxides, reacting the oxides with an alcohol resulting in the formation of esters, and metallic oxides, subjecting the esters, subsequent to purification, to a reduction reaction, subsequently coverting the metallic oxides to esters by reaction with a diol, and subjecting, subsequent to purification, the resulting esters to a reduction reaction.
