## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThis invention relates to catalytic compositions, and more particularly to catalytic compositions which exhibit a marked catalytic effect on the formation of unsaturated nitriles by vapor phase reaction of an olefin, ammonia and oxygen or an oxygen containing gas, particularly on the formation of acrylonitrile by vapor phase reaction of propylene, ammonia and oxygen or an oxygen containing gas.Description of the Prior ArtVarious catalysts have heretofore been proposed for the production of acrylonitrile by vapor phase catalytic ammoxidation of propylene. It is known in the art that a catalyst comprising molybdenum and bismuth as primary components and further containing such metallic elements as iron, nickel, cobalt and the like can be used to produce acrylonitrile in relatively good yield. However, when such a catalyst is used under the conditions where the gaseous materials are fed into the catalyst bed at a high space velocity and where the conversion of propylene is increased, the selectivity of the catalyst is so decreased that it becomes difficult to achieve a satisfactorily good yield of acrylonitrile. During our study with the intention of developing a catalyst which is capable of producing acrylonitrile with high selectivity even in the case where the gaseous materials are fed at a high space velocity and where the conversion of propylene is increased, we found and disclosed in our co pending application Japanese PatentApplication Laid Open KOKAI No. 110997 1979 that a catalyst comprising molybdenum, tungsten, bismuth, lead and oxygen within a certain range of compositiqn can be used to produce acrylonitrile in good yield even under the conditions where both the space velocity of the gaseous materials and the conversion of propylene are increased over the prior art.molybdenum bismuth catalysts. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONUpon our further study, we have now found that a further improved yield of acrylonitrile can be attained by use of a catalyst comprising molybdenum, bismuth, lead, antimony, oxygen and optionally tungsten, potassium and or phosphorus within a certain range of composition, and accomplished this invention.It is an object of this invention to provide an improved catalytic composition which can be used in commercial production of unsaturated nitriles including acrylonitrile to advantage. In accordance with the present invention, the abovementioned objective is accomplished by a catalytic composition having the formula Mo W b Bi c Pb d Sb e f P g O h in which a, b, c, d, e, f, g and h stand for the numbers of atoms for molybdenum, tungsten, bismuth, lead, antimony, potassium, phosphorus and oxygen elements, respectively, wherein, given that a b 12, 0 b 7 0.4 c 7 2 d 12 0.005 e a 1.14 0 f a 0.136 O g a 0.54, and h is one half the sum of the products of the valences and the numbers. of atoms for the individual. constituent elements other than oxygen. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONAs mentioned above, the catalytic compositions of this invention are represented by the formula MO a W b Bi c Pb d Sb e K f p g O h in which a, b, c, d, e, f, g and h stand for the numbers of atoms for molybdenum, tungsten, bismuth, lead, antimony, potassium, phosphorus and oxygen elements, respectively, wherein, given that a b 12, 0 b 7 o.65 c 7 2 d 12 0.005 e a 1.14 O f a 0.136 O g a 0.54, and h is one half the sum of the products of the valences and the numbers of atoms for the individual constituent elements other than oxygen.More specifically, the catalytic compositions of this invention include those represented by any of the formulae Mo a Bi c Pb d Sb e O h Mo a W b Bi c Pb d Sb e O h Mo a Bi c Pb d Sb e K f O h Mo a W b Bi c Pb d Sb e K f O h and Mo a W b Bi c Pb d Sb e K f P g O h wherein a, b, c, d, e, f, g and h are as defined above.In these formulae, it is preferred in order to improve the selectivity of the catalyst toward the desired unsaturated nitriles that the numbers of atoms for the individual constituent elements i.e., values, a to g satisfy the following equations given that a b 12, 0.08 b 5.5 0.67 1 c 6.3 2.6 d 11 0.045 e a 0.68 0.004 f a 0.11 0.016 g a 0.54The catalytic composition of this invention may be shaped with or without a carrier material such as silica, titania, alumina, silicon carbide or the like.The size and geometry of the shaped catalyst are not critical and the catalytic composition may be shaped into catalyst particles of any size and geometry e.g., pellets, tablets, granules, etc. depending on the conditions under which it is used.Molybdenum compounds useful for the preparation of the catalytic composition of this invention include molybdenum oxides such as molybdenum trioxide, molybdic acid and its salts, and phosphomolybdic acid and its salts. Preferably molybdates such as ammonium paramolybdate are used.Useful tungsten compounds include tungsten oxides such as tungsten trioxide, tungstic acid and its salts such as ammonium paratungstate, and phosphotungstic acid and its salts. Bismuth compounds that can be used include bismuth salts such as bismuth nitrate and bismuth sulfate and various oxides and hydroxides of bismuth. Useful lead compounds include lead salts such as lead nitrate and lead sulfate and various oxides and hydroxides of lead.Useful antimony compounds include oxides such as antimony trioxide, chlorides such as antimony trichloride and metallic antimony. Useful potassium compounds include potassium salts such as potassium nitrate, potassium carbonate, potassium molybdate, potassium tungstate, potassium phosphomolybdate, potassium phosphotungstate and potassium phosphates, and potassium hydroxide. Useful phosphorus compounds include phosphoric acids such as orthophosphoric acid, heteropolyphosphoric acids such as phosphomolybdic acid and phosphotungstic acid, salts of these acids, and organophosphorus compounds. The catalytic composition can be prepared from the appropriate combination of these raw materials by dissolving or suspending the compounds of the constituent elements in water to form a uniform aqueous slurry or solution.In some cases, a so . of a carrier material such as silica sol or alumina sol or carrier particles such as titania powder may be suspended in the slurry or solution. The resulting uniform slurry or solution is then evaporated to dryness and shaped in separate steps or in a single step by spray drying and finally calcined in a stream of air to prepare a catalyst. In preparation of the catalyst, when ammonium paramolybdate and or ammonium paratungstate is used as the molybdenum and or tungsten source, respectively, a dissolution accelerator such as ammonia is preferably added to the aqueous medium in order to increase the solubility of these compounds. In the case where bismuth nitrate or bismuth sulfate is employed as the bismuth source, it is preferably dissolved in a water acidified with nitric acid or sulfuric acid correspondingly.When antimony trioxide is used as the antimony source, it may be added after it has been dissolved in an aqueous solution of an organic acid such as tartaric acid, or otherwise it may be added directly in the form of powdered antimony trioxide. In the latter case, the resulting final slurry containing all the catalytic components including the antimony trioxide powder can be uniformly stirred, adjusted to pH 7 or less and heated at 400C or higher, preferably 80 to 1300C for at least 30 minutes, preferably 1 to 8 hours to further improve the selectivity of the finally obtained catalytic composition toward unsaturated nitriles.Following the shaping step, the shaped particles are usually calcined for 1 to 4 hours at a temperature in the range of 400 to 800 C, preferably in the range of 500 to 7500C, although the temperature and duration of the calcination step are not critical.The catalytic compositions of this invention can be used in the following way. The following description is limited to the production of acrylonitrile, it is to be.understood that the catalytic compositions can be used for the production of other unsaturated nitriles as well, In order to produce acrylonitrile, propylene, ammonia and oxygen or an oxygen containing gas are contacted in the vapor phase in the presence of a catalyst according to this invention e.g., one prepared in any of the following Examples . It is not always necessary that the starting propylene gas is of high purity, and the propylene gas may contain a substantial amount of other gas which is substantially inert to the reaction, for example, a saturated hydrocarbon such as propane. The oxygen used may be either pure oxygen gas or diluted with other gas or gases inert to the reaction.In a commercial operation air is usually employed as the oxygen containing gas. The molar ratio of oxygen to propylene fed to the reaction zone are usually in the range of 1 1 to 4 1, preferably from 1.5 1 to 2.5 1.Ammonia is fed in an amount of 0.8 to 2.5 moles, preferably 0.9 to 1.5 moles per mole of propylene. The vapor phase reaction is usually conducted at atmospheric pressure, but it may be carried out at a sub atmospheric or superatmospheric pressure as required. The reaction temperature is usually from 360 to 5400C, preferably from 400 to 5000C.The space velocity at which the gaseous reactants are fed may suitably be selected from the range of 100 to 3,000 hr 1, preferably 200 to 2,000 hr 1. The catalytic compositions of this invention may be used either in the fixed or fluidized bed system.As previously mentioned, the catalytic compositions of this invention are capable of formation of acrylonitrile with high selectivity even at an increased conversion of the starting gaseous material and hence they can be employed in the commercial production of acrylonitrile to advantage.Having generally described the invention, a more complete understanding can be obtained by reference to certain examples which are provided herein for purposes of illus t.ration only and are not intended to be limiting in any manner.The terms conversion , selectivity and yield of acrylonitrilen used herein, particularly in the examples are defined by the following equations Moles of propylene consumed Conversion x 100 Moles of propylene fed Selectivity x 100 Moles of propylene consumed Yield of acrylonitrile Conversion x selctivity 100Example 1In 31.9 ml of water was suspended 1.275 g of commercially available antimony trioxide Sb203 powder and to the resulting suspension were added successively 2.955 g of anatase titanium dioxide Ti02 powder and a solution of 3.263 g of ammonium paratungstate NH4 10W12O41 5H2O in 100 ml of aqueous 1 wt. ammonia.To the slurry, the following sol and solutions were added in that order with stirring 59 g of 20 wt. silica sol a solution of 8.280 g of lead nitrate in 22.5 ml of water a solution of 4.855 g of ammonium paramolybdate NH436Mo7024d4H200 in 25 ml of aqueous 5 wt. Q O ammonia and a solution of 4.851 g of bismuth nirtate Bi NO3 3 5H2O in 7.5 ml of aqueous 10 wt. Va nitric acid. Thereafter the pH of the slurry was adjusted to 4.0 by addition of an aqueous 10 wt. nitric acid solution and the slurry was then heated with stirring on a hot plate until the evolution of NO2 ceased and the heating was continued until the slurry was evaporated to dryness.The solid residue was compressed into tablets of 6 mm in diameter and 3 mm in thickness, which were then calcined at 550 C for 2 hours in a stream of air. The tablets were finally crushed to give a catalyst in the form of granules of 16 to 24 mesh Tyler in size. The catalyst thus obtained had the composition M 8.25 W3 75 Bi3.oo Pb7 50 Sb2.62 51.93 which was supported on a carrier comprising silica and titania. The weight ratio of silica to titania to total catalytic components was 40 10 50.A Pyrex reactor of 4 mm inner diameter was packed with 1 ml of the supported catalyst as prepared above. A mixed gas of propylene, ammonia and air having a molar ratio of propylene to ammonia to air of 1 1.2 10 was passed at a space velocity of 500 hr 1 through the catalyst bed in tubular reactor held at 470 C to produce acrylonitrile.The results were 97. 40 o conversion of propylene and 85. 2 selectivity toward acrylonitrile with 83.0 yield of acrylonitrile .Examples 2 22Following the procedure described in Example 1, various catalysts of composition indicated in the following table were prepared and used in the ammoxidation of propylene at temperatures indicated in Table 1.
