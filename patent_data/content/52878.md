## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a magnetic ferrite wedge. Magnetic wedges are in use as means for improving the efficiency of electric motors. Varied means for improving the motor efficiency have been studied and developed, and typical of then are known as the open slot and semiopen slot types. The motors incorporating those means consist essentially of a stator and a rotor, and at least one of the opposing surfaces of the two members, usually of the stator, is formed with axially extending slots or grooves at regular intervals along the inner or outer periphery of the cylindrical member, the slots having windings inserted and held in place, one for each. In the opening of each slot is firmly fitted a magnetic wedge to keep the winding securely and increase the motor efficiency. In this way the copper and iron losses are decreased and the overall efficiency is improved.However, because motors run at operating frequencies from about 50 hertz up to several hundred kilohertz, most wedges have to be made of iron or steel or, for added strength against break at the time of insertion, iron powder compacts reinforced with glass fiber. BRIEF SU WiARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention, therefore, aims at providing a magnetic wedge free from the afore said drawback. The invention makes possible a material improvement in the operating efficiency of motors by the adoption of sintered soft ferrite as wedge material. If a soft ferrite, a hard and brittle material per se, is formed into slender magnetic wedges, the products will easily be broken by subjection to lateral forces. Hence it has never been deemed possible that they can be inserted into the narrow slots of the stator or rotor and held in place by the forces of friction with the surrounding walls of the slots, and actually no attempts have ever been made to do so. In spite of this, the present inventors have found that a most satisfactory magnetic wedge can be made by devising a suitable jig and employing a proper ferrite material. The use of magnetic wedges according to the invention will remarkably reduce the losses and increase the operating efficiency of the motor by 1 to 2 , directly leading to a saving of energy. This will be readily understood from the length of time for which the motor runs. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIG. 1 is a fragmentary view of an electric motor incorporating the present invention and FIG. 2 is a perspective view of an insertion jig for a magnetic wedge embodying the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Among the soft ferrites which may advantageously be employed for the invention are the ferrites of Mn Zn, 1n Zn Fe, Ni Cu Zn, and Ni Fe types. As will be explained later, these soft ferrites will have little effect in the form of powder compacts they should always be used as sintered bodies. The soft ferrite for use in the invention may be made in the conventional way. Referring to FIG. 1, which illustrates how magnetic wedges are fitted in stator slots, the numeral 1 indicates a stator and 2 a rotor, the stator being the member wedged in this embodiment of the invention. The inner periphery of the stator 1 has a number of keyhole shaped slots 3 formed in an equidistantly spaced relation. Each slot 3 receives part of a winding 4, and its open end facing the rotor is closed with a generally T shaped magnetic wedge 5 of a size fit for the purpose. A long stick of magnetic ferrite is easily broken by forces applied laterally across its axis.If directly inserted into the slot such as by hammering or machine pushing, slidingly in parallel to its long opening, the stick would be subjected to excessive forces from the surrounding wall and the winding and could crack from stresses and strains. To avoid this, the stick is inserted in place using a jig as shown in FIG. 2. The space available for the magnetic wedge is very small because of the winding fitted deep in the narrow slot. Therefore, a metal jig to be used has twin T heads 6 and 10 either of which can force away the winding sidewise, or into a more compact form, to provide enough space for the wedge insertion.The T heads 6, 10 are formed in one piece with a base 7 of a given width W1 in between to constitute the jig. The top of the base in the middle part of the jig serves as a holding surface 8, and the height h of the T heads 6, 10 as measured from that surface is slightly greater than the height of the magnetic wedge 5. The width W7 of the base 7 is slightly less than the width W2 of opening of the slot 3, and the width T1 of the top of each T head is slightly less than the corresponding width T2 of the slot 3. The length 11 of the holding surface 8 is so chosen as to exceed the length 12 of the stator slot. For the wedging, the magnetic wedge 5 is placed on the holding surface 8, and the jig carrying the wedge is inserted, with its front end 11 as the guide, into the slot 3.The front T head 10 moves in the direction of the arrow, pushing the winding aside and creating a sufficient space for the accommodation of the wedge 5. The wedge is thus smoothly inserted into the slot without subjection to any stress. Since the length 11 of the holding surface on which the wedge rests is greater than the length 12 of the slot, the jig is then pulled downward out of the stator slot, leaving the wedge behind in place within the slot. Next, a few embodiments of the magnetic wedge of the invention will be described below. Magnetic wedges were designed and made for use with an induction motor of the semiopen type with four poles and ratings of voltage V 200 V, current I 3.8 A, 1410 rpm, and 750 W at 50 Hz and having 360 slots formed in the stator.The wedges were made in three types of different compositions, namely Mn0.7Zn0.2Fe0.1Fe2O4 Sintered ferrite body 1 , Ni0.34Cu0.1Zn0.56Fe2O4 sintered ferrite body 2 , and Nio 6Fe0 4Fe204 Sintered ferrite body 3 . For comparison purposes, a plastic molding containing 85 t by weight of pulverized sintered ferrite ferrite powder compact and a glass fiber reinforced plastic molding containing 70 by weight of iron dust iron dust compact were also made. Wedges of each type were fitted in the slots of the induction motor as shown in FIG. 1, and then the motor was tested for various characteristics. Also, the motor free from such magnetic wedges was tested in the same way.The items measured were the efficiency, power factor, slip, total loss, maximum output, and maximum torque of the motor during operation under rated conditions. The results were as tabulated below.

As cen be seen from the table, the wedges of sintered ferrite bodies 1, 2, 3 according to the invention reduced the total losses of the motors to levels lower than those with the green ferrite and iron compacts, to say nothing of the loss without the use of wedges. In addition, they permitted 1 to nearly 3 improvements in motor efficiency over the wedge free motor and 0.5 1.7 t over the motors using the ferrite powder compact wedge and iron dust compact wedge. It should be obvious to any one of ordinary skill in the art that these improvements made possible by the invention are of very great value from the viewpoint of energy saving.
