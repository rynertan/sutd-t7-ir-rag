# Saw assembly and work table therefor.

## Abstract
A work table for use with a chain saw comprises a flat topped work surface 10 having a slot 12 defined therein through part of which an elongate member 13 of a carrier unit extends uprightly. In the preferred embodiment the carrier unit is pivotal and is free to move longitudinally therein. The mem ber 13 has a chain saw guard 14 and a chain saw mounting bracket 15 in vertical spaced relation to extend from the same side thereof, parallel to and above and below the remain ing part of the slot respectively. The outer end of a stationary link arrangement 27 engages around the throttle 26 of a chain saw 19 . The chain saw 19 is fitted to the carrier unit with its cutter bar 18 extending upwards through the slot 12 parallel to the member 13 and clamped in mounting barcket 15 . With the throttle closed the chain saw is energised so that the engine idles, movement of a workpiece against the chain saw will tilt the pivotal unit about its pivot and this will cause the throttle to be opened to activate the blade of the cutter bar.
