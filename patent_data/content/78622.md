# LASTING HEEL SEAT AND SIDE PORTIONS OF A SHOE

## Abstract
In a combined heel seat and side lasting machine, in which the heel seat lasting operation takes place during the dwell time necessary for the cement side lasting operation, the backpart of the shoe remains free of any clamping pressure at least in and adjacent the backseam region thereof, which pressure would have the effect of forcing excess material out of the heel seat region into the region to be lasted by the side lasting instrumentalities, while at the same time provision is made for locating the shoe, prior to the side lasting operation, in a predetermined relationship, both heightwise and lengthwise, with the heel seat lasting instrumentalities. To this end, the shoe is first located lengthwise by the heel band 16 , whereatter, with the shoe clamped against a holddown 20 , the heel band is retracted out of engagement with the backseam region of the shoe during the side lasting operation. If desired, to assist in controlling any excess material, breast line grippers 172 may be provided, in which case the heel band, in its retracted position, is caused to clamp on to the shoe to maintain the tension provided by the breast line grippers and enable them to be released prior to initiation of the side lasting operation.
