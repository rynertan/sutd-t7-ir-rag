## Description
Gate pulse generating circuit and color television receiver The present invention relates to a gate pulse generating circuit for, for example, a color television receiver. In color television receivers or the like, there has been known a gate pulse generating circuit for generating gate pulses used for deriving a burst signal from a video signal, as shown in Fig. 1. The gate pulse generating circuit is comprised of a sync separation circuit 2 for separating a sync signal from a video signal supplied to a first input terminal IN1, a buffer amplifier circuit 4 for amplifying the sync signal derived from the sync separation circuit 2, and a waveshaper 6 for receiving the output signal of the buffer amplifier circuit 4 via a delay circuit 8. The delay circuit 8 includes a resistor 8A and a capacitor 8B connected in parallel between the output terminal of the buffer amplifier circuit 4 and ground.The sync signal from the sync separation circuit 2 is coupled with one input terminal of an AND circuit 10 connected at the other input terminal to the output terminal of the waveshaper 6 through an inverter 12. The output terminal of the AND circuit 10 is coupled with one input terminal of an AND circuit 14 whose other input terminal is connected to receive a flyback pulse supplied to a second input terminal IN2. In the gate pulse generating circuit, a sync signal contained in the video signal supplied to the first input terminal IN1 is synchronized with a flyback pulse supplied to the second input terminal from a flyback transformer not shown via a resistive circuit.In the gate pulse generating circuit, when the sync signal is produced from the sync separation circuit 2, the AND circuit 10 produces a burst gate pulse delayed behind the sync signal. The burst gate pulse is produced as a gate pulse through the AND circuit 14 when the flyback pulse is supplied. However, when the sync separation circuit 2 produces no sync signal, the AND circuit 14 is disabled, which produces no gate pulse. For example, when the video signal supplied to the first input terminal IN1 is small, the sync separation circuit 2 may not properly derive the sync signal from the video signal. In this case, the AND circuit 14 produces no gate pulse, so that no DC restoration is performed, which is necessary for reproducing the contrast of a picture with a good fidelity, and no color synchronization operation for the color signal detection is also performed.Therefore, the output DC current greatly fluctuates or the color synchronization can not be attained, making the reproduced picture instable. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a gate pulse generating circuit capable of generating gate pulses reliably. To achieve the above object, there is provided a gate pulse generating circuit comprising a sync separation circuit for deriving the sync signal from a video signal, a delay circuit for delaying a sync signal derived from the sync separation circuit, a burst gate pulse generator for generating a burst gate pulse in response to the output signals from the sync separation circuit and the delay circuit, and a gate pulse generator which responds to a burst gate pulse from the burst gate pulse generator to generate a gate pulse, and when the burst gate pulse generator produces no burst gate pulse, responds to a flyback pulse supplied through capacitive coupling means to generate a gate pulse synchronized with the flyback pulse. In the present invention, when a sync signal is appropriately extracted from a video signal and a burst gate pulse is generated, a gate pulse is generated in synchronism with the burst gate pulse. On the other hand, when the sync signal is not derived from the video signal and no burst gate pulse is generated, a gate pulse synchronized with the flyback pulse is generated.Therefore, even when the sync separating operation is not properly performed, the gate pulse generating circuit can produce the gate pulse. With this arrangement, when the video input signal level drops or no video signal is supplied, the gate pulse is produced, and the DC restoration is ensured, thereby to provide a stable reproduced picture. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows a conventional gate pulse generating circuit Fig. 2 shows a gate pulse generating circuit according to an embodiment of the present invention Fig. 3 is a detail circuit diagram of the gate pulse generating circuit shown in Fig. 2 Figs. 4A to 4H show signal waveforms illustrating the operation of the gate pulse generating circuit shown in Fig. 3 Figs. 5A to 5E show signal waveforms illustrating the operation of the gate pulse generator shown inFig. 3 and Figs. 6 and 7 show gate pulse generators which may be used instead of the gate pulse generator shown inFig. 3. Fig. 2 is a circuit diagram of a gate pulse generating circuit according to an embodiment of the present invention. This circuit is substantially the same as that of the Fig. 1 except that a NAND gate 20 is used in place of the AND circuit 10, a gate pulse generator 22 is used instead of the AND gate 12, and a capacitive coupling circuit 24 is additionally used for capacitively coupling the second input terminal IN2 with the gate pulse generator 22. Fig. 3 is a detail circuit diagram of the gate pulse generating circuit shown in Fig. 2. The sync separation circuit 2 is composed of a pnp transistorTR1 having a base connected to the first input terminalIN1 through a resistor R1, an emitter connected to a power source terminal VD, and a collector grounded through a series of resistors R2 and R3. The buffer amplifier circuit 4 is composed of an npn transistorTR2 having a collector connected to the power source terminal VD, and a base connected to the collector of the pnp transistor TR1. The emitter of the npn transistor TR2 is grounded through a parallel circuit of the resistor 8A and the capacitor 8B in the delay circuit 8. The waveshaper 6 has a differential amplifier composed of pnp transistors TR3 and TR4 whose emitters are coupled with the power source terminal VD through a resistor R4. The base of the transistor TR3 is connected to the emitter of the npn transistor TR2, and its collector is grounded. The base of the transistor TR4 is connected to a junction between resistors R5 and R6 connected in series between the power source terminal VD and ground. The inverter 12 is composed of an npn transistor TR5 having a base connected to a junction between the resistors R2 andR3 and an emitter grounded. The NAND circuit 20 is composed of a resistor R7 which is connected at one end to the collectors of the transistors TR4 and TR5 and grounded at the other end, and an npn transistor TR6 having a base grounded via the resistor R7 and an emitter directly grounded.In the gate pulse generator 22, resistors R8 and R9 are connected in series between the power source terminal VD.and ground. A pnp transistor TR7 is connected at the base to the collector of the transistor TR6 and to a junction between the resistors R8 and R9, and grounded at the collector. An npn transistor TR8 is connected at the emitter to the emitter of the transistor TR7, and at the collector to the power source terminal VD through serially connected resistors R10 and R11. A pnp transistor TR9 is connected at the base to a junction between the resistorsR10 and Rill, at the emitter to the power source terminalVD, and grounded at the collector via a resistor R12.The base of the transistor TR8 is connected to one end of a resistor R13 whose other end is connected through a capacitive coupling circuit 24 to the second input terminal IN2. The capacitive coupling circuit 24 is composed of a capacitor 24A coupled between the resistorR13 and the second input terminal 1N2, and a resistor 24B coupled between the resistor R13 and ground. The output gate pulse of the gate pulse generating circuit is derived from the collector of the transistor TR9, The operation of the gate pulse generating circuit shown in Fig. 3 will be described referring to Figs. 4A to 4H. A video signal as shown in Fig. 4A is applied to the first input terminal IN1. When the video signal is higher in level than the power source voltage VD, the pnp transistor TR1 is made nonconductive, so that the collector of the transistor TR1 is set at the ground potential level VS, as shown in Fig. 4B. When the video signal is lower in level than the power source voltage VD, the transistor TR1 is made conductive, and the collector potential of the transistor TR1 becomes equal to the voltage level VD. In this way, the sync separation circuit 2 responds to the input video signal shown in Fig. 4A to generate a sync signal shown in Fig. 4B. The buffer amplifier circuit 4 responds to the synchronization signal from the sync separation circuit 2 to generate a pulse signal.During a period that the pulse signal from the buffer amplifier circuit 4 is at a high level, a high level voltage VH is applied to the base of the transistor TR3, as shown in Fig. 4C. At this time, since a predetermined voltage V1 R6 x VD R5 R6 has been applied to the base of the transistor TR4, the transistor TR3 is made nonconductive, while the transistor TR4 is made conductive. Then, when the sync signal shown in Fig. 4B becomes low, the base potential of the transistor TR3 gradually decreases from the high level voltage VH to the ground potential level VS at a rate determined by the time constant of the resistor 8A and the capacitor 8B. When the base potential of the transistor TR3 falls below the predetermined voltage V1, the transistor TR3 is made conductive, while the transistor TR4 is made nonconductive.In this way, the transistor TR4 is kept conductive for a period T1 ranging from an instant that the base potential of the transistor TR3 becomes high in level till it becomes lower than the predetermined voltage V1. The base of the transistor TR5 is supplied with a voltage which is obtained by voltage dividing the sync signal shown inFig. 4B by a dividing ratio determined by the resistorsR2 and R3. When this sync signal is high in level, the base potential of the transistor TR5 is high, and the transistor TR5 is conductive. Accordingly, during a period that the sync signal shown in Fig. 4B is kept high, the transistors TR4 and TR5 are conductive and the base potential of the transistor TR6 is kept low, as shown in Fig. 4D.During the period T2 from an instant that the sync signal becomes low in level till the base potential of the transistor TR3 becomes lower than the predetermined voltage V1, the transistor TR4 is conductive, while the transistor TR5 is nonconductive. Under this condition, a current I flows through the resistor R4, the transistor TR4 and the resistor R7.Then, a voltage of I x R7 is applied to the base of the transistor TR6 over the period T2, as shown in Fig. 4D, thereby to render the transistor TR6 conductive. The period T2 during which the transistor TR6 is kept conductive is adjustable by changing the predetermined voltage V1 applied to the base of the transistor TR4 and the time constant of the delay circuit 8. This implies that if the period T2 is set so that the color burst signal in the video signal appears during this period T2, it is possible to use the output signal from the NAND circuit 16 as a burst gate pulse. In response to the voltage shown in Fig. 4D, the transistor TR6 is rendered conductive. At this time, the base potential of the transistor TR7 decreases from the predetermined voltage V2 R9 VD R8 R9 to the ground potential VS, as shown in Fig. 4E. Then, it is kept at the ground potential over the period T2. The second input terminal IN2 is supplied with the flyback pulse shown in Fig. 4F which is synchronized with the sync signal shown in Fig 4B by an automatic frequency control circuit not shown . Then, the flyback pulse is supplied to the base of the transistorTR8 through the capacitive coupling circuit 24 and the resistor R13. When the voltage between the bases of the transistors TR8 and TR7 rises to be two times or more the built in potential VBE, these transistors TR8 andTR7 are made conductive. The conducting period of the transistors TR8 and TR7 is determined by the burst gate pulse shown in Fig. 3, when the sync signal shown inFig. 4B is produced. When the sync signal shown inFig. 4B is not obtained, the conducting period is determined by the flyback pulse. When the transistors TR8 and TR7 are made conductive, the predetermined voltage V3 R10 VD R10 Rill is applied to the base of the transistor TR9, so that the transistor TR9 is made conductive and its collector voltage becomes approximately equal to the power source voltage VD. Under this condition, when the sync signal of Fig. 4B is produced from the sync separation circuit 2, the gate pulse generator 22 produces a gate pulse synchronized with the burst gate pulse shown in Fig. 4E, as shown in Fig. 4G. When the sync signal shown inFig. 4B is not obtained, a gate pulse shown in Fig. 4H synchronized with the flyback pulse of Fig. 4F is produced. The operation of the gate pulse generator 22 will be described referring to Figs. 5A to 5E. In this generator 22, the predetermined voltage V2 is set at 2 V and the amplitude of the flyback pulse is set at 5 V.Assume now that a sync signal is derived from the sync separation circuit 2 and the burst gate pulse shown in Fig. 5A is produced from the NAND gate 20. When the output pulse at the ground potential level VS is produced from the NAND circuit 20, and the flyback pulse shown in Fig. 5B is supplied to cause a voltage higher than 2 VBE, for example, 2 x 0.7 V to be applied between the bases of the transistors TR8 and TR7, then, these transistors TR8 and TR7 are made conductive. Then, as described above, the gate pulse generator 22 generates the gate pulse as shown in Fig. 5C. In this case, the base potential of the transistor TR7 is kept at the ground potential level VS, and the base potential of the transistor TR8, at 1.4 V. When the burst gate pulse from the NAND circuit 20 reaches the ground potential level, the flyback pulse is at about the peak level.Further, the second input terminal IN2 is coupled with the base of the transistor TR8 through the capacitor 24A. Accordingly, the potential at the second input terminal IN2 is decreased to approximately 3.6 V.Afterwards, this potential gradually changes toward 0 V level. In this case, if the time constant determined by the capacitor 24A and the resistor 24B is set to an appropriate value larger than the period of the sync signal, the potential at the second input terminal IN2 may be changed from 3.6 V to 3.2 V, for example, during each period of the flyback pulse. In case where the potential at the input terminal IN2 is kept in a range between 3.6 V and 3.2 V, if the flyback pulse reaches its peak under a condition that the transistor TR6 is nonconductive and the base potential of the transistor TR7 is set at 2 V, a maximum of 1.4 V will be applied across the base to base path of the transistors TR8 and TR7. Accordingly, these transistors TR8 and TR7 are kept nonconductive.Thereafter, when the transistor TR6 is made conductive and the base potential of the transistor TR7 is decreased to the ground potential level VS or 0 V, a voltage of 1.4 V is applied between the bases of the transistors TR8 and TR7, thereby to render the transistors TR8 and TR7 conductive. The transistors TR8 andTR7 are made nonconductive when the base potential of the transistor TR7 becomes 2 V. In this way, when the sync signal is perdiodically produced from the sync separation circuit 2, the gate pulse generator 22 produces the gate pulse Fig. 5C in synchronism with the burst gate pulse from the NAND circuit 20 shown inFig. 5A. When a sync signal is not generated from the sync separation circuit 2, the transistor TR6 is kept nonconductive and the base potential of the transistorTR7 is kept at 2 V. Accordingly, when the voltage between the bases of the transistors TR8 and TR7 becomes higher than 1.4 V according to the flyback pulse applied to the transistor TR8 through the capacitive coupling circuit 24 and the resistor R13, that is, the base potential of the transistor TR8 becomes higher than 3.4 V, then the transistors TR8 and TR7 are made conductive. Upon turning on of these transistors, the base potential of the transistor TR8 is kept at 3.4 V and the potential at the second input terminal IN2 is decreased to approximately 1.6 V. Then, this potential gradually changes toward 0 V.In this case, if the time constant of the capacitor 24A and the resistor 24B is selected to be an appropriate value larger than the period of the flyback pulse, the potential at the second input terminal IN2 may be changed from 1.6 V to 1.4 V, for example, during each period of the flyback pulse.When the level of this flyback pulse is at 3.4 V, the transistors TR8 and TR7 are made conductive. When the level of the flyback pulse is lower than 3.4 V, these transistors are made nonconductive again. In this way, when no sync signal is produced from the sync separation circuit 2, the gate pulse generator 22 produces the gate pulse shown in Fig. 5E, which is synchronized with the flyback pulse shown in Fig. 5D. The pulse width of the gate pulse obtained in this case is controllable according to the time constant determined by the capacitor 24A and the resistor 24B. Fig. 6 shows a gate pulse generator which may be used in place of the gate pulse generator 22 shown in Fig. 3. The gate pulse generator of Fig. 6 is comprised of npn transistors TR10 and TRll whose emitters are grounded through a resistor R20, and a pnp transistor TR12 whose emitter is connected to the power source terminal VD, and the collector is grounded via a resistor R22. The collector of the transistor TR10 is coupled with the power source terminal VD and the base thereof is connected to the output terminal of the NAND circuit 20 Fig. 3 and to a junction between resistors R8 and R9 connected in series between the power source terminal VD and ground.The collector of the transistor TRll is conncted to the power source terminal VD through a resistor R23 and the base thereof is coupled with the capacitive coupling circuit 24 Fig. 4 via a resistor R24. When a sync signal is produced from the sync separation circuit 2, the NAND gate 20 produces a voltage at a low level VS shown in Fig. 4 which in turn is applied to the base of the transistor TR10. Then, the transistor Troll is made conductive, so that the base potential of the transistor Troll is kept at a potential equal to the sum of the voltage drop V20 across the resistor R20 and the base to emitter voltage VBE of the transistor Trip. In this case, as described above, the potential at the second input terminal IN2 is set at the potential of 5V V20 VBE . The gate pulse synchronized with the burst gate pulse produced every time the sync signal is produced, is derived from the collector of the transistor TR12. When the sync signal is not produced, the base potential of the transistor TR10 is set at 2 V, for example, and when the base potential of the transistor Troll is at 2 V or more by the flyback pulse, the transistor TRIl is made conductive. Also in this case, the potential at the second input terminal IN2 is set at apredetermined level, and gradually rises according to the time constant of the capacitor 24A and the resistor 24 till the flyback pulse is supplied. When the sync signal is not generated, the gate pulse synchronized with the flyback pulse is derived from the collector of the transistor TR12. Fig. 7 shows a gate pulse generator which is replaceable with the gate pulse generator 22 shown inFig. 3. The gate pulse generating circuit is composed of resistors R8 and R9 connected between the power source terminal VD and ground, and a pnp transistor TR13 which is connected at the base to the output terminal of the NAND gate 20 via a resistor R30 and to a junction between the resistors R8 and R9, and grounded at the collector via a resistor R31. The emitter of the transistor TR13 is coupled with the capacitive coupling circuit Fig. 3 via a resistor R32. When the sync signal is produced, the base potential of the transistor TR13 is temporarily set to the ground potential level by the low level signal from the NAND gate 20. Under this condition, when the level of the flyback pulse rises and becomes higher than the emitter to base voltage VBE of the transistor TR13, the transistor TR13 is made conductive.At this time, the emitter of the transistor TR13 is kept at the predetermined voltage VBE, so that the potential at the second input terminal IN2 is set at the potential level 5 VBE 4.3 V. In the subsequent operation cycle, only when the transistor TR13 is supplied with the flyback pulse, and the base thereof is set to the ground potential level, the transistor TR13 is made conductive. Then, a gate pulse synchronized with the burst gate pulse shown in Fig. 4E is taken out from the collector of the transistor TR13. When the sync signal is not generated, the base potential of the transistor TR13 is kept at 2 V.Therefore, when the flyback pulse potential is 2.7 V or more, the transistor TR13 is made conductive. In this case, since the emitter potential of the transistor TR13 is kept at 2.7 V, the potential at the second input terminal IN2 is set at 2.3 V. The potential at the second input terminal IN2 slightly changes in the positive direction till the next flyback pulse is supplied. Subsequently, when the emitter potential of the transistor TR13 exceeds 2.7 V, the gate pulse is derived from the collector of the transistor TR13.
