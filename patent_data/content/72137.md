## Description
NOVEL COMPOUNDS This invention relates to certain deoxyuridine compounds which have antiviral activity. UK Patent Specification No. 1601020 discloses 5 2 halogenovinyl 2 deoxyuridines which have antiviral activity selective against herpes virus. We have now found a group of methyl substituted derivatives of 5 2 halogenovinyl 2 deoxyuridine which have excellent antiviral activity, and which are useful in the treatment of infections caused by herpes viruses, such as herpes simplex type 1, herpes simplex type 2 and varicella. The derivatives give surprisingly prolonged high levels of antiviral activity in the blood of animals when administered orally. According to the present invention there is provided a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable active ester thereof EMI2.1 in which Y is a halogen atom, preferably a bromine atom. The compounds of formula I may be prepared by treating a 5 2 halogenovinyl 2 deoxyuridine compound of formula II EMI2.2 in which Y is as defined in formula I with a methyl halide of formula CH3X, in which X is a halogen atom, preferably an iodine atom. The reaction is suitably carried out in a polar organic solvent, preferably anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, at room temperature, and is preferably catalysed by fluoride ions. The product is preferably purified chromatographically by, for example, column chromatography on silica gel. An alternative process for preparing the compounds of formula I comprises treating a compound of formula II as defined above with N,N dimethyl formamide dimethylacetal, preferably in the presence of an acid catalyst such as trifluoroacetic acid. The process is suitably carried out under an inert atmosphere, preferably nitrogen, by heating under reflux. The product may be obtained by heating the reaction mixture to dryness, and purifying chromatographically on silica gel. Esters of the compounds of formula I may be 3 ,5 diesters, or 3 mono or 5 mono esters, and these may be prepared by acylating the compounds of formula I with an appropriate acylating agent, such as organic acid chloride or anhydride, under normal acylating conditions. The compounds of formula I or esters thereof may be formulated for use in a pharmaceutical composition.Accordingly, in a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of the formula I or ester thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Compositions which may be given by the oral route may be compounded in the form of syrups, tablets and capsules. When the composition is in the form of a tablet, any pharmaceutical carrier suitable for formulating such solid compositions may be used, for example magnesium stearate, starch, lactose, glucose, rice, flour and chalk. The composition may also be in the form of an ingestible capsule, for example of gelatin, to contain the compound, or in the form of a syrup, a solution or a suspension. Suitable liquid pharmaceutical carriers include ethyl alcohol, glycerine, saline and water to which flavouring or colouring agents may be added to form syrups. The compounds may also be presented with a sterile liquid carrier for injection. The composition may also be formulated for topical application to the skin or eyes. For topical application to the skin, the compounds of the invention may be made up into a cream, lotion or ointment. These formulations may be conventional formulations well known in the art, for example, as described in standard books of pharmaceutics and cosmetics, such as Harry s Cosmeticology published byLeonard Hill Books, and the British Pharmacopaeia. The composition for application to the eyes may be a conventional eye drop composition well known in the art. Preferably, the compositions of this invention are in unit dosage form or in some other form that the patient may administer to himself a single dose. A suitable dosage unit might contain from 50 mg to 1 g of active ingredient, for example 100 to 500 mg. Such doses may be adminstered 1 to 4 times a day or more usually 2 or 3 times a day. The effective dose of compound depends on the particular compound employed, but is in general in the range of from 1.0 mg kg day to 20 mg kg of body weight per day or more usually 2.0 mg kg day to 10 mg kg day. Accordingly, in a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of treating viral infections in human or non human animals which comprises administering to the animal an effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable active ester thereof. The following Examples illustrate the invention.

In Cell Culture Vero African Green Monkey Kidney cells were grown to confluence in 6 well multidishes, each well being 3.5 cm in diameter. The cells were incubated with Herpes simplex type 1 virus HFEM strain and overlaid with 0.5 ml of 0.9 agarose w v in maintenance medium containing the test compound at a range of concentrations from 100 pg mL in half log dilution steps. The virus infected cultures were then incubated at 370C for 6 days before fixing in 4 formaldehyde solution and staining with carbolfuchsin.The dishes were then examined to find what concentration of test compound causing a 50 reduction in the number of virus plaques formed PDDso value and the minimum concentration of test compound which killed the cell monolayer, leaving a clear zone devoid of cells and virus plaques MTD .ResultsCompound PDDso MTD Rg mL g mL 3 Methyl E 5 2 bromovinyl 2 deoxyuridine 5.4 100 2. In Vivo Blood Level Studies Single 100 mg kg doses of the compound were administered orally as suspensions in carboxymethyl cellulose to groups of 3 starved female Balb c mice.Blood was collected 120 minutes after dosing and the serum separated and stored at 200C. Heat inactivated sera from single mice were titrated in plaque inhibition assays using the KOS strain of Herpes simplex type 1 virus in Vero cell monolayers. Antiviral activity is calculated by extrapolation from a standard inhibition dose response curve for E 5 2bromovinyl 2 deoxyuridine and is quoted as the equivalent concentration of E 5 2 bromovinyl 2 deoxyuridine in pg mL giving the same antiviral activity in cell culture.ResultsTime after dosing 3 Methyl E 5 2 E 5 2 bromo minutes bromovinyi 2 vinyl 2 deoxyuridine deoxyuridine 120 3.1 0.8 1.7 0.5 The above results show that, 120 minutes after dosing, the blood level of antiviral activity in the compound of Example 1 is nearly twice that of the potent antiviral agent E 5 2 bromovinyl 2 deoxyuridine.
