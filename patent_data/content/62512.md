# Musical instrument and method of assembling a musical instrument.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for mounting a head on a musical instrument, such as a drum, tambourine, banjo, or the like. A polymeric sheet 12 is stretched across the opening in a first member, such as an annular hoop 14 , having a channel 16 formed along the edge thereof which is at least partially filled with an adhesive. A plug member 18 is preferably inserted into the channel such that the polymeric film is shaped and stretched as it is forced into the channel and contacts the adhesive. The channel of the first member is inserted into a cavity 22a corresponding in shape thereto in a second member, such as an annular ring 22 which forms the rim along the edge of the shell of the musical instrument such that the first member is firmly engaged therein. The apparatus and method of the present invention permit a head to be easily and quickly installed or removed from the shell of the instrument without the neces sity of utilizing a clamping or similar means to secure the head to the musical instrument.
