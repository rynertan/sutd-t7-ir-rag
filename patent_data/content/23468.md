# Electrically actuated aircraft brakes.

## Abstract
Apparatus for electrically controlling the application and release of aircraft brakes. In one embodiment, the invention includes a slurry clutch controlling a reciprocating member which is operatively connected to the pressure plate. In another embodiment of the invention, a torque motor is adapted to have an armature which comprises a ball screw, the ball screw being in engagement with a longitudinal drive rod interconnected with the pressure plate. Rotation of the armature causes the drive rod to move the pressure plate into forceful engagement with the brake disk stack or to retract the same. In yet another embodiment of the inven tion, a plurality of torque motors are interconnected with a bull gear which is operative for driving the pressure plate. Each of the embodiments of the invention includes apparatus for maintaining a fixed built in clearance in the brake disk stack of the brake assembly, and are further adapted for utilization with antiskid systems by utilizing a device connected to the pressure plate which allows rapid release of brake torque. Additionally, apparatus is provided which allows a locking of the brake assembly while the air craft is parked.
