# INTERGRATED RADIATION SENSING ARRAY

## Abstract
An incident radiation sensing apparatus is provided which comprises an array of radiation sensitive elements, such as photovoltaic cells or photoresistors, formed as an integrated circuit on a substrate. Preferably crossing address lines are used to read the elements, and isolation devices, such as di odes, make the elements individually readable. A conversion means, for converting from a second form of radiant energy to a first form to which the sensing elements of the invention re spond, can be placed over those elements, enabling them to sense images in the second form of radiation. The invention can be used as a contact type document scanner. The inven tion can also be used to integrate the amount of radiation which falls upon its sensors, greatly increasing its sensitivity.
