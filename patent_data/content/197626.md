# Textile structure measurement.

## Abstract
Thick textile structures such as cross folded card webs, where most of the transmitted light is light that has passed through the fibres of the textile structure, can be measured by measuring transmission through the said structure from an infra red source, such for example, as a tungsten filament lamp run at a dull glow.
