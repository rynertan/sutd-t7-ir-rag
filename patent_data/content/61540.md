# Prosthesis for prevention of gastro esophageal reflux.

## Abstract
An improved prosthesis 20 for maintaining the intra abdominal reduction of a sliding esophageal hernia. The prosthesis comprises a generally C shaped cushion which is positioned around the distal esophagus 17 between the diaphragm 13 and stomach 45 . The overall size of the prosthesis is large enough to prevent extension of the gastric fundus into the thoracic cavity through an enlarged esophageal hiatus. The prosthesis is of generally constant cross sectional area along its entire length to prevent upward migration of the prosthesis through the enlarged esophageal hiatus and to maintain the accentuated curvature of the esophagus 17 induced by emplacement of the prosthesis. Tie means 27 are provided to maintain the prosthesis 20 in operative position.

## Description
This invention relates to a surgical prosthesis and method for using the same. More particularly, the invention concerns an improved prosthesis for use in preventing gastro esophageal reflux. In another respect, the invention relates to an improved method for using a surgical prosthesis to prevent gastro esophageal reflux. When When the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm muscle becomes enlarged, a portion of the stomach immediately below the gastro esophageal junction the gastric fundus may actually slide upwardly through the esophageal hiatus into the chest or thoracic cavity. This anatomic condition, known as a sliding esophageal hernia frequently causes gastro esophageal reflux in which stomach acids and foods are regurgitated into the esophagus.The characteristic symptoms of gastro esophageal reflux consist of substernal burning, regurgitation and frequent eructations.These symptoms are accentuated by recumbency, tight garments and physical activity, particularly bending at the waist. Long term gastro esophageal reflux leads to complications, namely dysphagia from an esophageal stricture. Various procedures have been devised for the repair of sliding esophageal hernias and for the prevention of gastro regurgitation and eructations. Crural repair almost invari bly fails since it is almost impossible to effectively suture the constantly moving diaphragm. Therefore, other procedures to prevent the stomach from sliding through the enlarged esophageal hiatus were devised. According to the posterior gastropexy procedure of Hill, the crura is closed behind the esophagus and the stomach is sutured to the arcuate ligament over the aorta to hold the stomach within the abdominal cavity.According to the Niessen II procedure, the gastric fundus is formed into a ring around the distal esophagus. The added bulk of this ring around the esophagus forms a valve preventing regurgitation and, at the same time, preventing the stomach from sliding through the enlarged esophageal hiatus. The The Hill procedure described above is very difficult to perform on obese patients and it appears that the sutures from the lesser curvature of the stomach to the arcuate ligament are of a transient nature. According to the Niessen II procedure, it is necessary to suture the stomach to itself and to the esophagus. My earlier issued U. S. Patent, No. 3,875,928, discloses a further method for maintaining the reduction of a sliding esophageal hiatal hernia. The method comprises emplacing aC shaped prosthesis about the distal esophagus between the gastric fundus and the diaphragm. The prosthesis has a tape secured about the periphery thereof. The free ends of the tape, which extend well beyond the tapered ends of the C shaped cushion, are tied together then sutured to the stomach to maintain the prosthesis in proper operative position. Both the Hill and Niessen II procedures described above and the method described in my earlier issued U. S. Patent, No. 3,875,928, attempt to maintain the stomach in its natural position below the diaphragm in order to prevent gastro esophageal reflux. As illustrated in Figure 6 of my earlier issued patent, when the prosthesis is in the proper operative position, the larger diameter central portion of the C shaped cushion bears against the hind side of the esophagus 17 and accentuates the curvature which exists in the portion of the esophagus between the stomach 43 and diaphragm 13. This increased curvature in the esophagus 17 apparently minimizes the probability of recurrence of gastro esophageal reflux and also makes upward migration of the prosthesis and upper portion of the stomach 45 through the hiatal hernia more difficult. Observation has confirmed that the repetitive contracting movements of the stomach 43 cause the sutures attaching free ends 27 to the stomach 43 to be of transient nature. When the sutures free themselves from the wall of the stomach 43, the prosthesis 20 tends to rotate about the esophagus 17 and the tapered ends 23 move behind the distal esophagus 17 and above the upper part of the stomach 45. When the tapered ends 23 have rotated to a position behind the esophagus 17, outward pressure on the esophagus 17 is largely diminished. As a result, the additional curvature originally imparted to the esophagus by the greater sized center portion of the prosthesis is lost, and the recurrence of gastro esophageal reflux is more probable. In addition, after rotating to a position above the upper part of the stomach 45, the tapered ends 23 typically move upwardly into and through the enlarged esophageal hiatus 12 such that the prosthesis 20 migrates from the desired operative position to a position above the diaphragm 13. Alternatively, when the sutures disengage from the stomach 43, the prosthesis 20 may, without rotating, simply travel essentially vertically up the esophagus 17 allowing the tapered ends 23 to move into the enlarged esophageal hiatus 12 and promote migration of the prosthesis from the proper operative position to a position above the diaphragm 13. Accordingly, it is a principle object of the present invention to provide an improved prosthesis and method for preventing gastro esophageal reflux. Another object of the invention is to provide an improved prosthesis for maintaining the intra abdominal reduction of a sliding esophageal distal hernia. Still another object of the invention is to provide an improved surgical prosthesis which would, when positioned about the distal esophagus, maintain the desired position between the diaphragm and stomach. Yet another objective of the invention is to provide an improved prosthesis which would, when emplaced about the distal esophagus, maintain the accentuated curvature of the portion of esophagus between the stomach and diaphragm and which would not necessitate suturing the prosthesis to the stomach or to other anatomical structures. A further object of the invention is to provide an improved method for preventing gastro esophageal reflux when the gastro esophageal junction is positioned above the diaphragm. Still another object of the invention is to provide an improved method for preventing gastro esophageal reflux which does not require suturing or require reduction of the esophageal hiatus. These and other further and more specific objectives and advantages of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description thereof, taken in conjunction with the drawings in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view of the preferred embodiment of the prosthesis which I use in accordance with my improved procedure for repairing a sliding esophageal distal hernia Fig. 2 is a sectional side view of the prosthesis ofFig. 1 taken along section line 2 2 thereof Fig. 3 is a top view of the prosthesis of Fig. 1 Fig. 4 is a perspective anatomical drawing illustrating the initial steps according to my procedure of reduction of the hiatal hernia and Fig. 5 is a perspective anatomical drawing illustrating the prosthesis of Figs. 1 3 located in a proper operative position to prevent recurrence of the hiatal hernia Fig. 6 is a cross sectional view of the stomach, diaphragm and esophagus illustrating a typical sliding esophageal hernia Fig. 7 is a perspective view of the prosthesis whichI use in accordance with the preferred embodiment of my improved procecure for preventing gastro esophageal reflux Fig. 8 is a sectional perspective view of the prosthesis of Fig. 7 taken at section line 7 7 thereof Fig. 9 is a perspective anatomical drawing illustrating the initial steps in the implantation of the prosthesis ofFigs. 7 8 and Fig. 10 is a perspective anatomical drawing illustrating the prosthesis of Figs. 7 8 located in its proper operative position to prevent gastro esophageal reflux. Briefly, in accordance with my invention I provide an improved prosthesis for use in maintaining the intra abdominal reduction of a sliding esophageal hiatal hernia by preventing extension of the gastric fundus into the thoracic cavity through an enlarged esophageal hiatus. The improved prosthesis comprises a generally C shaped cushion member, and means for maintaining the C shaped cushion member in operative position around the distal esophagus between the gastric fundus and the diaphragm and for maintaining the selected spacing of the free ends. TheC shaped cushion is deformable to permit adjustment of the spacing of the free ends thereof at a selected distance and has a generally constant cross sectional area along the length thereof.The inside diameter of the prosthesis generally corresponds to the normal outside diameter of the distal esophagus and the outside diameter thereof is larger than the enlarged esophageal hiatus. In another embodiment of my invention, I provide an improved method for preventing gastro esophageal reflux when the gastro esophageal junction is positioned above the diaphragm.The method comprises positioning a generally C shaped cushion prosthesis around the distal esophagus, adjusting the free ends of the prosthesis at a spacing to permit normal expansion of the esophagus during swallowing, and fixing the free ends of the prosthesis in the adjusted position to maintain the C shaped cushion prosthesis in operative position around the distal esophagus generally adjacent to the gastric fundus when the gastro esophageal junction is positioned above the diaphragm and to maintain the adjusted spacing of free ends. The C shaped cushion has an inside diameter generally corresponding to the normal outside diameter of the distal esophagus, and is deformable to permit adjustment of the spacing of the free ends thereof at a selected distance. The prosthesis employed in my improved method bears radiopaque indicia which facilitate radiographic determination of the position of the prosthesis after emplacement thereof around the distal esophagus. The means for maintaining the cushion member in its operative position preferably comprises an elongate tape member secured around the periphery of the cushion member. The free ends of the tape extend substantially beyond the free ends of the C shaped cushion member, i.e., a distance sufficient to allow the ehds of the tape member to be tied together. Turning now to the drawings, Fig. 1 depicts the preferred embodiment of the surgical prosthesis which I utilize to maintain the reduction of an esophageal hiatal hernia. The prosthesis consists of a generally C shaped cushion member 21, the inside dimensions of which generally correspond to the normal outside dimensions of the distal esophagus reference character 17,Fig. 5 . In a typical prosthesis, the inside dimensions will equal about 3.1 by 2.5 centimeters, although prosthetic devices having somewhat larger and somewhat smaller inside dimensions should be provided to the surgeon for use where the patient may have an esophagus somewhat larger or somewhat smaller than normal. The outside dimensions of the prosthesis are sized to be substantially larger than the enlarged esophageal hiatus reference character 12, Fig. 5 , and in a typical prosthesis, the outside dimensions will equal about 6.0 by 7.0 centimeters.Obviously, these outside dimensions are also variable in accordance with the size of the enlarged esophageal hiatus of a particular patient. In accordance with the prosthesis as shown in Figs. 1 3, the cushion member has a generally circular cross section and is of generally constant cross sectional area along the length thereof. The prosthesis is preferably constructed by filling outer flexible integement 24 with a gel liquid 25 such that the entire cushion member 21 is deformable to permit adjustment of the spacing of the free ends 23 at a selected distance which will permit the normal expansion of the esophagus during swallowing. The precise materials of construction of the integement 24 and the filler 25 of the C shaped cushion member 21 are not highly critical so long as they are compatible with body tissues, i.e., do not induce rejection or cause other body reaction.In the presently preferred embodiment of the invention,I employ a silicone elastomer shell filled with a highly cross linked silicone gel manufactured by Dow Chemical Company and sold under the trade name Silastic . A tape 26, preferably siliconecoated Dacron, is secured to the C shaped cushion member 21 around the outer periphery thereof and the free ends 27 of the tape extend substantially beyond the free ends 23 of theC shaped cushion member 21 to a distance sufficient to allow the free ends 27 fo the tape 26 to be tied together. Preferably, the prosthesis is provided with a tantalum filled silicone strip 28 on tape 26 such that after implantation of the prosthesis, radiographic examination will reveal whether the prosthesis is in its proper operative position. The method of use of the prosthesis of Figs. 1 3 is illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5. My procedure consists of opening the abdominal cavity with an upper midline incision and exposing the area of the diaphragmatic hiatus by medially retracting the left lobe of the liver. The peritoneum and sac of the hiatal hernia 12 are then incised and the hernia 12 is reduced by retracting the stomach 43 intra abdominally. As shown in Fig. 4, the prosthesis 20 of Figs. 1 3 is then placed around the distal esophagus 17 immediately above the gastric fundus 45. Fig. 5 illustrates the prosthesis 20 in position after the free ends 27 of the tape 26 are anteriorly tied at 46 to locate the free ends 23 of the prosthesis 20 at the proper spacing and the tape end remnants are cut leaving about an inch of length.Suturing of the free ends to the stomach or to other anatomical structures is not required to maintain the prosthesis 20 in its proper operative position around the distal esophagus 17 between the gastric fundus 45 and the diaphragm 13. The prosthesis shown in my earlier issued U. S. Patent,No. 3,875,928, has tapered ends and a larger sized center portion.In the proper operational position, the center portion of the tapered prosthesis is situated behind the distal esophagus 17 to increase the curvature of the esophagus. Increased curvature of the esophagus apparently tends to reduce gastro esophageal reflux. When the sutures binding the free ends of the Dacron tape to the stomach free themselves the tapered ends of the C shaped cushion prosthesis tend to rotate to a position behind the esophagus 17 and above the gastric fundus 45.Since the size of the tapered ends of the prosthesis is insufficient to accentuate the curvature of the esophagus, the lessening of gastro esophageal reflux achieved when the tapered prosthesis also initially placed in the proper operative position is lost. In addition, after rotating to a position above the gastric fundus, the tapered ends tend to enter the hiatal hernia 12 and promote upward migration of the prosthesis through the diaphragmatic hiatus 12. In contrast to the tapered prosthesis described in my earlier issued patent, the prosthesis herein illustrated inFigs. 1 3 is of generally constant cross sectional area along its entire length, i.e., the ends of the prosthesis are not substantially tapered. Consequently, even if the prosthesis rotates about the distal esophagus, the accentuation of the curvature of the esophagus 17 is maintained. Further, in the great majority of hiatal hernias, the consistent size of the present prosthesis along the length thereof eliminates upward migration of the prosthesis into and through the diaphragmatic hiatus. The prosthesis generally maintains the proper operative position between diaphragm 13 and stomach 43. In sum, in the presently preferred embodiment of my improved method, the prosthesis need not be sutured in position to effectively maintain the reduction of a sliding esophageal hiatal hernia. Fig. 8 depicts a typical sliding esophageal hiatal hernia and shows the gastric fundus 10 extending into the thoracic cavity 11 through the enlarged esophageal hiatus 12 of the diaphragm 13. In this position, the lesser sphincter 14 of the esophagus 15, being transposed into the chest from its normal position just below the esophageal hiatus 12 operates less effectively. This permits gastro esophageal reflux of stomach acids and foods which are not evacuated by esophageal peristalsis and which remain in the lower esophagus for prolonged periods causing irritation and damage to the lower esophagus mucosa 16. Figs. fig. 6 and 7 depict the prosthesis device which I utilize in the preferred embodiment of my improved method for preventing gastro esophageal reflux. The prosthesis consists of a generally C shaped cushion member 21, the inside dimensions of which generally correspond to the normal outside dimensions of the distal esophagus reference character 17, Fig. 8 . In a typical prosthesis, the inside dimensions will equal about 3.75 by 2.5 centimeters and the outside dimensions will equal about 6.25 by 5.25 centimeters, although prosthetic devices having somewhat larger and somewhat smaller inner and outer dimensions should be provided to the surgeon for use where the patient may have an esophagus somewhat larger or somewhat smaller than normal. In accordance with the prosthesis shown in Figs. 6 7, the cushion member has a genrally circular cross section and is tapered from the central portion 22 toward the free ends 23 thereof. The prosthesis is preferably constructed by filling outer flexible integement 24 with Åa gel liquid 25 such that the entire cushion. member 21 is deformable to permit adjustment of the spacing of the free ends 23 at a selected distance which will permit the normal expansion of the esophagus during swallowing. The precise materials of construction of the integement 24 and the filler 25 of the C shaped cushion member 21 are not highly critical so long as they are compatible with body tissues, i.e., do not induce rejection or cause other body reaction.In the presently preferred prosthesis, I employ a silicone elastomer shell filled with a highly cross linked silicone gel. A tape 26, preferably silicone coated Dacron, is secured secure to the C shaped cushion member 21 around the outer periphery thereof and the free ends 27 of the tape extend substantially beyond the free ends 23 of the C shaped cushion member 21 to a distance sufficient to allow the free ends 27 of the tape 26 to be tied together. Preferably, the prosthesis is provided with a tantalum filled silicone strip 28 on tape 26 such that after implantation of the prosthesis, radiographic examination will reveal whether the prosthesis is in its proper operative position. The prosthesis shown in Figs. 1,2 also may be employed in the practice of my improved method. Obviously, a variety of variously sized and shaped prosthetic devices could be employed in my improved method for preventing gastro esophageal reflux. The method of use of the prosthesis of Figs. 6, 7 is illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10. My procedure consists of opening the abdominal cavity with an upper midline incision and exposing the area of the diaphragmatic hiatus. As shown in Fig. 9, the prosthesis 20 is then placed around the distal esophagus 17 immediately above the gastric fundus 45. Fig. 10 illustrates the prosthesis 20 in position after the free ends 27 of the tape 26 are anteriorly tied at 46 to locate the free ends 23 of the prosthesis 20 at the proper spacing and after the tape end remnants are cut leaving about an inch of length. The prosthesis 20, when emplaced around the distal esophagus immediately above the stomach, acts as a mechanical valve and generally precludes regurgitation while permitting the regular downward flow of food from the esophagus to the stomach. Intra abdominal retraction of the stomach 43 through the esophageal hiatus 12 prior to emplacement of the prosthesis 20 is not required. Similarly, reduction of or suturing of the diaphragmatic hiatus 12 is not necessary before or after the prosthesis 20 is in operative position. I In order to prevent gastro esophageal reflux, the method described in my earlier issued U. S. Patent, No. 3,875,928, attempts to preclude upward migration of the stomach through the esophageal hiatus by suturing a prosthesis emplaced around the esophagus to the stomach. As described herein, my improved method, without any suturing whatsoever and without reduction of the hiatal hernia, prevents gastro esophageal reflux by placing a prosthesis around the esophagus when the gastro esophageal junction is located above the diaphragmatic hiatus. Having now described my invention and the use thereof in such clear, concise and exact terms as to enable those skilled in the art to understand the invention and practice it, and having identified the presently preferred embodiments of the invention, I claim
