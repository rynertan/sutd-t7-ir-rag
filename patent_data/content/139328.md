## Description
The invention relates to an animal drinking device, in particular suitable for pigs, comprising an upright back plate a drinking bowl with an overflow edge defining a maximum water level water metering means positioned near the back plate above the bowl and having a valve and a pressure member extending downwardly so that the lower end is at a level flush with or lower than the maximum water level in the bowl, wherein the bowl has a lowest area which is positioned substantially closer to the back plate than to the overflow edge a substantially tubular housing extending obliquely upward from the back plate, wherein the tubular housing at its lower portion together with the lower portion of the back plate forms the bowl, and wherein the tubular housing in order to form a head insertion opening is cut off along a plane which intersects the plane of the back plate at a sharp angle along a line above the back plate proper. Such an animal drinking device has been disclosed in a price list of L.S. Brouwers Stalinrichtingen B.V., dated 4th July 1983 It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved animal drinking device, particularly suitable for pigs, having improved properties regarding prevention of water wastage and in general improving hygiene and allowing simple maintenance. According to the invention an animal drinking device as described above is characterized in that the valve is a nipple valve which is substantially vertical and in that the pressure member extends from the underside of the casing of the valve, wherein the lower end of the pressure member is located substantially higher than the lower end of the back plate. Since the drinking device according to the invention in fact is modelled on the anatomy of the drinking animal s head, e.g. that of a sow, the animal is guided by the walls of the housing to move its head towards the bottom of the trough during its insertion therein, owing to the relatively slight play around its head, the deepest point of which is as far away from the head insertion opening as possible. The animal first drinks of the available quantity of lure water and then proceeds to press against the pressure member of the water metering means so as to again supply water to the trough. When the drinking device is used properly, which as has appeared in practice can be rapidly learned by the animal, a reciprocating movement takes place during the drinking so that the animal successively drinks of the water supply from the trough, moving its head towards the pressure member for a fresh water supply, thereby pressing against it, subsequently moves its head again towards the water supply in the trough to drink again, etc. Since the slight quantity of lure water is repeatedly replaced by clean water, the formation of bacteria in the trough is prevented. There is no obstacle on the insertion line from the head insertion opening towards the opposite wall and the lure water supply in the bowl of the trough can be provided as far away from the insertion opening as possible in the direction of the opposite wall. As a result of the greater distance from the lure water supply to the head insertion opening, in combination with the relatively slight free space in the trough around the head on account of the anatomical shape of the snout, spillage of water during drinking has proved to be appreciably less than is the case in the prior drinking device. The reciprocating movement made by the animal s head while drinking from the water supply in the trough towards the pressure member and back is made possible by choosing the distance from the lure water level towards the pressure member operating the water supply sufficiently larger than the thickness of the animal s snout. It is thus avoided that also during drinking pressure is exerted against the pressure member, thereby increasing the chance of water being wasted. On the other hand, the location of the lower end of the pressure member should be at a level flush with or lower than the maximum water level, that is near the level of the overflow edge of the trough, thus preventing the animal from pressing its snout continuously against the pressure member, resulting in overflow of the trough. When the distance from the lure water level towards the pressure member is effectively chosen, the water rising in the trough, in case of prolonged pressure exerted by the animal against the pressure member, due e.g. to playfulness, will flow into the animal s nostrils, partly due to the anatomical form, so that it is forced to release the pressure member again. One embodiment of the drinking device according to the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which The animal drinking device 1 shown in the drawing is composed of the trough 2 fitted with attachment lugs 22 Fig. 1 and the water metering means 2 . The trough is made of cast iron and internally enameled, having a height of 21 cm and a depth of 16 cm. At 19 is shown the head insertion opening and at 20 the overflow edge of the trough. The trough can be connected through the coupling 3 to the water supply pipe connected to a water source. The drinking device as shown has a back plate 33 which in use will be in an upright position. From the back plate a substantially tubular housing extends obliquely upward. The lower part of the tubular housing together with the lower part of the back plate 33 forms a bowl 32 which in use will hold the water. The tubular housing has side wall sections 34 and upper and lower wall sections 36 and 38 respectively, together forming an all sidedly closed tube. The tube has been cut off to obtain the head insertion opening 19 at some distance from the back plate. The plane of the head insertion opening 19 intersects the plane of the back plate at some distance above the back plate proper. The angle between the center line of the tubular housing and said plane intersecting the plane of the back plate, which angle faces the plane of the back plate, may be larger than 90 as shown in Fig. 1. The water metering means 2 comprise the valve casing 37 divided into casing portions 4 and 5, within which the other members associated with the water metering means are confined, while the assembly is retained in place in mounted condition via the retaining clip 6, keeping the casing portions 4 and 5 fixed relatively to one another. The members associated with the water metering means 2 , and disposed within the valve casing comprise the nipple valve 11 with the end portion functioning as actuating member 12 and extending into the trough 2 and the constricted portion 13 with which the nipple valve is conducted through the larger diameter opening 16 in the valve casing and which is furthermore fitted with the sealing collar 14. Under the influence of the tension of the spring 9 produced via the collar 8 of the dirt catcher 10, the sealing collar 14 is pressed onto the seat edge 17 through the intermediary of the rubber O ring 5, thus blocking the water supply to the trough. At 10 is shown a dirt catcher having the form of a truncated hollow cone. The size of the water passage 18 is defined by the height of the cone and may e.g. be enlarged by shortening the cone. At a given pressure of the water, the water supply can be adjusted by means of the size of the water passage, or the connection of the water metering means to a water source or can be adjusted under high or low pressure while the water passage and hence the water supply can be enlarged by shortening the dirt catcher. By pressing its snout axially on the under side against the pressure member 12, thereby lifting the nipple valve 11 with the sealing collar 14 and the O ring 15 against spring tension, or by laterally pressing against the pressure member 12, and by tilting the nipple valve with the sealing collar 14 and the O ring 15 off the seat 17, the drinking animal can cause water to flow via the opening 16 into the trough 2. The nipple valve 11 is effectively made of brass or of another corrosion resistant material, such as a synthetic plastics material. The highest water level in the trough is indicated at 21. In accordance with KIWA regulations, the height The drawing clearly shows that the interior of the trough is easily accessible and hence easy to clean. There are no dead corners which can be attained with difficulty, where dirt, e.g. manure, may accumulate. The maintenance of the water metering means can be effected in a simple manner only the retaining clip 6 need be removed so that the valve casing portions 4 and 5 can be separated and the parts confined within the valve casing can be removed without the use of tools.
