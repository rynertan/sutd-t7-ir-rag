# Surface acoustic wave transducer.

## Abstract
The surface acoustic wave transducer in accordance with the present invention comprises a piezo electric subs trate, and a first type electrode strips set A which generates an electric reflection alone with no acoustic reflection and a second type electrode strips set B which generates both of an electric reflection and an acoustic reflection, both types being formed on the piezo electric substrate. The first type electrode strips set A is formed by electrode strips with approximate width of 1 8 of the wavelength of the surface acoustic wave, while the second type electrode strips set B is formed by electrode strips with approximate width of 1 8 and approximate width of 3 8 of the wavelength of the surface acoustic wave.
