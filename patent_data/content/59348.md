# An electroconductive paste to be baked on ceramic bodies to provide capacitors, varistors or the like.

## Abstract
An electroconductive paste consists essentially of 100 parts by weight of zinc in finely divided form, from about 0.01 to 15.00 parts by weight of an organic titanium compound such as, typically, tetrakisstearoxytitanium, and a vehicle, such as alpha terpineol containing ethylcellulose as an organic binder, for pasting the mixture of the zinc powder and the organic titanium compound. The paste may contain an additive or additives such as the oxides of some metallic elements. By being baked on ceramic bodies at a tempera ture above the melting point of zinc, the paste forms conductors or electrodes of ceramic capacitors, varistors or the like. The conductors or electrodes thus prepared from the zinc paste are approximately equivalent in electrical and mechanical properties to those fabricated from the familiar silver paste.
