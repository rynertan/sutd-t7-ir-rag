## Description
BLISTER PAD ADHESIVE BANDAGEFIELD OF IMVENTIOIl The present invention relates to adhesive bandages conprising a central pad area and adjacent adhesive areas, and more particularly, to blister pad adhesive bandages constructed entirely from heat fusible, nonwoven fabric materials.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Adhesive bandages comprising a central pad area and adjacent adhesive areas are well known in the art and popular as first aid wound dressings. Current bandages generally comprise an elongated strip of cloth or plastic hacking material coated on one surface with a pressure sensitive adhesive. A gauze or sponge pad is secured to the adhesive surface in a central location to serve as the wound cover. The wound facing surface of the pad may be plastic coated or otherwise treated to prevent the pad from adhering to the wound. Plastic coated release strips are placed over the adhesive areas and the entire assembly is placed in a sealed package and sterilized to be ready for use.An alternate form of adhesive bandage, generally referred to as an island bandage, comprises 2 generally square, round or oval adhesive coated backing material with a centrally located pad forming an island surrounded by the adhesive surface. The adhesive surface is similarlv covered by release paper before the bandage is packaged and sterilized. The adhesive bandages of the prior art are characterized by their construction of two basic components the adhesive coated backing material and the wound covering pad material. The pad material may be dry or impregnated with various bactericides or other wound treatment medicaments. The capacity of the pad to absorb and hold such compositions is a limiting factor on the amount of such material which may be incorporated into the bandage.It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved adhesive bandage. It is a further object of this invention to provide a low cost adhesive bandage through the use of inexpensive materials and low cost manufacturing techniques. A further object of this invention is to provide an adhesive bandage having a high loading of wound treatment medicament in the pad area. These and other objects of the present invention will be apparent fron the ensuing description and clans of the invention. SU iARV Adhesive bandages comprising an elongated strip of material having a centrally located blister pad and adjacent adhesive portions extending from each side of the pad area are prepared from a heat bondable, absorbent, nonwoven fabric material. The blister pad is applied to the center of the bandage strip and secured by heat bonding. A medicated gel or other material may be deposited on the bandage strip and covered with the blister pad to provide a medicated bandage. The portions of the bandage extending beyond the pad area are permanently compacted to provide a surface suitable for coating with adhesive, The pad area is preferably left uncompacted to retain loft and absorbency, but may be heat glazed to provide a nonadhering wound release surface. Strip bandages are conveniently prepared according to the present invention from a first, continuous base fabric having a width equal to the overall length of the desired bandage, and a second, continuous pad fabric having a width at least equal to the desired pad area. The base fabric is fed through a station where a medicated gel or other material is deposited onto the center of the moving fabric if desired. The pad fabric is then applied as a blister dome over the deposited material and the combined fabrics passed through a hot roll calendering station where the edges of the pad and the portions of the base fabric extending from each side of the pad area are compacted and heat fused to secure the pad and to form a dense, nonwoven sheet like structure extending from the pad area.The composite fabric is next passed through an adhesive application station where a pressure sensitive Adhesive, preferably a hot nelt type adhesive, is coated onto one surface. of the compacted base fabric on either side of the pad area. Adhesive release liners are applied over the adhesive area and the composite structure fed to a cutting station where strips are cut or stamped transversely to machine direction of the web to obtain individual adhesive bandages. As the bandages are cut from the composite web, the edges of the pad area are heat sealed along a narrow band to form a well defined pad area which totally encloses the deposited material. The resulting bandages are ready to be packaged and sterilized.Island bandages according to the present invention are prepared by depositing the medicated gel onto the center of the base fabric in spots spaced at intervals in registry with the desired pad area of the final bandage.The pad fabric, preferably of the sane width as the base fabric, is applied and the combined fabrics passed through an embossing station where the fabric surrounding the pad area is compacted and heat fused to form a central blister pad surrounded by a compacted, nonwoven sheet like structure.The adhesive is applied to the compacted portion of the bandage fabric by printing or other suitable means.Adhesive release liners are applied over the adhesivecoated areas and the bandages die cut to forn individual island bandages having a central blister pad area. The resulting bandages are packaged and sterilized using conventional procedures.The material used in the fabrication of bandages according to the present invention is preferably a nonwoven fabric composed of absorbent fibers such as cellulose or rayon and h eat fusible fibers such as polyethylene or polypropylene, in relative proportions such that the pad of the finished bandage is soft and absorbent while the heat bonded and compacted areas are strong and stable.DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIGURE 1 is schenatic representation in perspective of a process used to produce strip adhesive bandages of the present invention.FIGURE 2 is a cross sectional view in perspective of tht base web of FIGURE 1 through line 2 2.FIGURE 3 is a cross sectional view in perspective of the base web after application of the pad, through line 3 3 ofFIGURE 1.FIGURE 4 is a cross sectional view in perspective of the base web and pad after application of adhesive, through line 4 4 of FIGURE 1.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE IflVENTIOi The strip adhesive bandages of the present invention are fabricated from continuous lengths of bandage material which are preferably bulky, heat fusible, absorbent, nonwoven fabrics. The bandage is fabricated by positioning the pad material over the center area of the base fabric, securing the pad by heat welding the edges thereof, and heat fusing the edge portions of the base fabric extending from the pad area to provide surfaces capable of accepting an adhesive. After applying the adhesive and covering the adhesive surfaces with release liners, the composite web is cut transversely to its machine direction in strips the width of the desired bandage. The central pad portion of the bandage comprises a double thickness of the starting bandage materials. Since it is generally desirable for the bandage pad to be absorbent as well as providing a cushioning effect, it is important for the initial bandage materials to also possess these properties. In addition, since the fabric forming the pad must be secured in some manner, the bandage materials are preferably a heat fusible composition which permits the pad fabric to be continuously and permanently heat welded along the edges to the base fabric.A bandage material meeting all the above requirements is a nonwoven fabric comprising a mixture of cellulose or other absorbent fibers and polyethylene or other heat fusible fibers. The heat fusible fibers are interspersed throughout the web and are preferably present in an amount of at least 10 by weight. The fabric preferably has sufficient thickness or bulk so that the triple layered pad has a thickness of at least 2 mm in the final bandage. Nonwoven webs useful in the practice of the present invention are known in the art for use in other applications. See, for example, U.S. Patents Nos. 2,774,128 3,067,747 4,083,913 4,160,159 and 4,307,721.A particularly preferred bandage material is a low density, highly absorbent, thermal bonded nonwoven fabric comprising absorbent fibers and staple length polyesterpolyethylene conjugate fibers. These nonwoven fabrics are produced by a process which includes producing a web comprising absorbent fibers and staple length polyester polyethylene conjugate fibers subjecting the web to a temperature sufficient to fuse the lower nelting component of the conjugate fibers without fusing the higher melting component while maintaining the web under little or no compression and cooling the web to resolidify the lower melting component of the conjugage fibers, thereby forming a nonwoven fabric bonded at sites where the conjugate fibers touch each other and adjacent absorbent fibers.A particularly preferred nonwoven fabric is a laminate comprising a core of a mixture of short length natural cellulose fibers and staple length polyester polyethylene conjugate fibers, and a light weight veneer of heatfusible fibers on each surface of the core. The composite web is passed through a through air heater to fuse the lower melting component of the conjugate fibers while maintaining the fibrous integrity of these fibers, and to ruse or soften the surfaces of the heat fusible fibers in the two outer veneers. As the material emerges from the heater and cools, the fused surfaces of the lower melting component of the conjugate fibers, i.e., the polyethylene, solidify, and bonds form where these surfaces touch each other and other fibers.The thermal bonded, nonwoven fabrics particularly useful in the practice of the present invention employ polyester polyethylene conjugate fibers wherein at least about 50 percent of the surface of the individual fibers is polyethylene. Most preferred are sheath core fibers with the polyethylene as the sheath and the polyester as the core, The fibers will usually have a denier within the range of from about 1 to about 6, and a length within the range of from about 1 2 inch to about 3 or 4 inches.Absorbent fibers employed in such thermal bonded, nonwoven fabrics include rayon staple fibers, cotton fibers, short length natural cellulose fibers such as wood pulp fibers and cotton linters, and mixtures thereof.Heat fusible fibers used in the veneer of the nonwoven fabric are preferably staple length conjugate fibers.However, if desired, other types of heat fusible fibers such as polypropylene homofil fibers can he used in the veneer. The veneer can also contain other fibers, such as rayon, cotton, or polyester staple fibers.The above bonded, nonwoven fabrics normally have basis weights from about 1 2 to about 6 ounces per square yard.The bulk density of the fabrics is usually below about 0.15 gram per cubic centimeter, preferably below about 0.09 gram per cubic centimeter, e.g., from about 0.02 to about 0.09 gram per cubic centimeter, and more preferably, from about 0,025 to about 0.06 gram per cubic centimeter.The fabrics preferably have an absorbent capacity, as measured by a Gravimetric Absorbency Tester, of at least 600 percent and preferably at least 1400 percent, exclusive of any nonabsorbent layer such as a veneer of 100 percent fusible fibers.The process of preparing adhesive strip bandages from continuous rolls of bonded, nonwoven fabric bandage material will be better understood by reference toFIGURES 1 through 6. In FIGURE 1, the center portion of nonwoven base fabric 10 from roll 8 passes over idler roll 40 and under metering apparatus 12 where a bead or spots of medicated gel or other material 13 is deposited onto the center line of the fabric. The cross section of the base fabric carrying the gel is illustrated in FIGURE 2. nonwoven pad fabric 11 feeding from roll 9 passes under idler roll 41 which is adjusted to provide clearance for the gel between the pad and base fabrics. The composite fabric next passes between hot calendaring rolls 1t and 15, which heat the material to about 100 to 1500C,where the edges 26 and 27 of the pad fabric are welded to the base fabric and the side widths 28 and 29 of fabric extending from the pad area are compacted under heat and pressure to form a thin, dense, sheet like material. Roll 14 includes a bridging center section to avoid compacting the pad area of the fabric. The cross section of the resulting product is illustrated in FIGURE 3.The composite fabric next passes through the adhesive application station where a pressure sensitive, skincompatible adhesive is applied from reservoirs 16 and 17 to the compacted side portions of the material, the adhesive coating being designated as 30 and 31. FIGURE 4 is a view in cross section of the adhesive coated compositc fabric. The adhesive may be any pressure sensitive, medical grade adhesive suitable for use in adhesive bandages, and is preferably a hypoallergenic hot melt adhesive. Emulsion adhesives may also be used provided the adhesive application station includes means for drying the adhesive after application.As the adhesive coated material continues through the process, the adhesive coating and the central pad area are covered by release papers 32 and 33 fed from rolls 18 and 19 respectively. The release papers preferably overlap along the center of the web over the pad area. FIGURE 5 is a view in cross section of the composite material after application of the release papers. The composite material next passes through a cutting station where cutters 21 and 22 cut the material into transverse strips 23 while simultaneously heat fusing the cut edges of the pad fabric to enclose the gel material.The cut strips are carried on conveyor belt 24 to a packaging station not shown where individual strips are packaged in sealed envelopes prior to sterilization. The cut strips 23 are further illustrated in cross section in FIGURE 6.An individual strip bandage produced according to the present invention is illustrated in FIGURE 7 with the adhesive release papers removed. In the illustrated bandage, pad 25 is set in from the longitudinal edges of the bandage by heat fused areas 34 and 35 to form a welldefined pad portion which totally encloses the medicated gel or other material contained between the base fabric and the pad fabric.Other bandage configurations and constructions utilizing the inventive concepts of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the principle feature of the present invention being the construction of an adhesive bandage and pad utilizing heat fusible bandage materials, preferably continuous webs comprising heatfusIble fibers.Representative of such other bandage configurations are the square island bandage illustrated in FIGURE 3 and the spot bandage illustrated in FIGURE 9, both of which are herein referred to as island bandages. Island bandages are characterized by centrally located blister pad area 36 surrounded by an adhesive coated area 37 To provide an adhesive area of uniform thickness throughout, it is desirable for the pad fabric used in the manufacture of the bandage to extend over the entire width of bandage rather than simply over the pad area as in the case of the strip bandage. Additionally, to prevent the medicated gel from interfering with compaction of the fabric and application of the adhesive, the gel is applied to the base fabric in spots in registry with the final pad area of the bandages.The pad area of the island bandage is sealed by passing the fabrics through a hot embossing station, with rollers configured according to the size and shape of the desired bandage whereby the areas of the bandage surrounding the pad are heat compacted to for a dense, sheet like, structure capable of accepting an adhesive coating. The adhesive is preferably applied by transfer coating or other convenient method to provide a continuous coating of adhesive over the compacted material surrounding the pad area. Adhesive release liners are applied in continuous strips overlapping the central pad area, and individual bandages then die cut from the continuous feed of composite material. Bandage flexibility and bias characteristics can be modified by altering fiber type and orientation. The bandage material can be further modified by incorporating fiber finishes to vary absorbency characteristics if desired. The surface of the pad intended for placement against the wound may be heat glazed or otherwise surface modified to provide wound release characteristics without significantly affecting the sulk or absorbency. of the pad.These and other variations which will be apparent to those skilled in the art are induced within the scope of the present invention.
