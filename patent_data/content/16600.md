An outrigger 17 is provided to support an oar by means of rowlock 22 at its free end. The other end of outrigger 17 is pivotably mounted on scull 10 about vertically extending axis 21 . A coupling element 24 couples outrigger 17 , whereby as the stretcher is moved fore and aft during rowing the outrigger 17 is pivoted about axis 21 . The coupling position of element 24 to outrigger 17 is adjustable. In an alternative embodiment the outrigger 17 is pro vided with an interconnecting member which assists raising of the blade of an oar. Forms of the invention for conventional rowing boats are also described.
