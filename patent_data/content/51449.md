# Method of manufacturing amorphous silicon films.

## Abstract
In a method of manufacturing an amorphous silicon compound by subjecting a gas containing a silane com pound to glow discharge decomposition, a substrate on which an amorphous silicon compound is deposited is positioned within plus or minus 3 cm from the end of a positive column formed by glow discharge.
