# Apparatus for melt forming bottom stop of slide fastener chain.

## Abstract
A bottom stop melt forming apparatus melt forms a bottom stop on a continuous slide fastener chain which alternately has a portion in which elements of a thermoplas tic synthetic resin material are interlocked with each other and a space portion in which no element is present. The apparatus includes a device which advances the slide fastener chain a positioning member having a positioning projection which is adapted to enter the space portion and to engage an element at the rear edge of the space portion a device which is adapted to sense the engagement between the positioning projection and the element and to stop the advance of the fastener chain an ultrasonic horn which is disposed in close proximity to the positioning projection and an anvil which is adapted to clamp and press the fastener chain between the same and the ultrasonic horn after the fastener chain has stopped. The apparatus further includes a groove which is formed on the positioning member and is adapted to slidably guide the anvil.
