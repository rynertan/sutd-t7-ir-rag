# Frequency processing method and apparatus for radiation image.

## Abstract
In a radiation image recording and reproducing system, an image signal obtained by forming a radiation image by a ra diation passing through an object and photoelectrically detect ing the radiation image is subjected to frequency processing by use of a predetermined degree of enhancement. The de gree of enhancement is corrected in accordance with the radi ation exposure does so that the degree of enhancement is de creased as the exposure dose decreases, thereby improving the image quality of a reproduced visible image.
