# Body carry electrical contact strips.

## Abstract
A strip of body carry electrical contacts formed by a progressive die from flat strip stock comprises a series of identical electrical contacts 12 integrally joined by central contact carrier segments 22 . The contact carrier segments are displaced relative to the plane of the contact strip such that the interface 24 between each carrier segment and each electrical contact is partially severed. Accordingly, the contact strip will withstand normal manufacturing processes and the carrier segments may be removed from the contact strip to separate the contacts without a metal cutting operation.
