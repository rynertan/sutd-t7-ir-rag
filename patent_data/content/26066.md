# Thin film laser gyro.

## Abstract
A passive ring resonator laser gyro 10 includes a thin film, passive waveguide 12 adapated to provide a closed, substantially circular propagation path for optical signals. Couplers 32, 34 are provided for coupling coherent optical signals in opposite directions in the waveguide 12 . Fre quency shifters 28, 30 for each of the counter rotating optical signals are adapted to adjust the frequencies of the respective signals in the waveguide to achieve the resonance along the optical path encountered by each of the signals. Detectors 44,48 provide signals representative of the frequency shifts of the two counter rotating optical signals in the waveguide. These signals are nulled by servos which apply correcting frequencies to the frequency shifts 28,30 . A control network 56 generates a rate signal corresponding to the difference in frequency between the signals applied to the shifters 28,30 . The rate signal is representative of the angular rotation rate of the waveguide.
