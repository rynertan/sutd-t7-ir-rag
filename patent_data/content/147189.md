# Construction for an athletic shoe and process of making.

## Abstract
The mold for shaping the sole and providing studs on the underside of the sole has a pre moulded portion of wear resistant rubber disposed in it at a position which is exposed to heavy wear in use. The rest of the sole, made of conventional rubber of lower wear resistance, is then moulded round the pre moulded portion. The latter may be carbon fibre reinforced and be partially cured during premoulding. A bonding layer may be introduced between the insert and the body of the sole.
