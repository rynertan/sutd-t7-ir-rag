# Low density disposable absorbent bandage.

## Abstract
A low density disposable absorbent bandage, in particular a disposable diaper 1 , provided with an absorbent pad comprised of an airlaid mat of relatively stiff, high yield wood pulp fibers having relatively little cohesive strength in airlaid form or a similar low strength absorbent preferably encapsulated by an envelope 2 4 of wet strength tissue paper. The absorbent pad 21 is preferably enclosed between a liquid retaining backsheet 6 and a liquid pervious topsheet 5 secured in superposed relation to the liquid retaining backsheet. A wet strength tissue ply 30 having a maximum stretch characteristic of about thirty percent, as measured at the point of rupture, is preferably located in a plane approximately midway between the outermost tissue plies which encapsulate the low strength absorbent media. The low stretch, wet strength tissue ply imparts unexpected improvements in pad integrity to the structure in use, thereby facilitating maximum utilization of the greater void volume inherent in such low density structures for more efficient absorption and retention of body exudates.
