# Method for fabricating self aligned high resolution non planar devices employing low resolution registration.

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for fabricating structures having electrically conductive regions such as high resolution se miconductor device and circuit designs which require only low resolution alignment steps during fabrication. The method is used to fabricate metal semiconductor field ef fect transistors MESFET and metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors MOSFET devices and incorporates the following features. A device with very small i.e. sub micro meter dimensions is positioned in a relatively large device well such that the exact position of the device in its well is not critical. Isolation and interconnection of devices in different wells is achieved by standard masking and alignment techniques with a resolution corresponding to the larger dimensions of the device wells. All high resolu tion features of each device are contained in a single mask ing level 26 . To separate and insulate different elements of the device at such small dimensions different height levels are used in the device so that one masking step can produce zero lateral spacing between the different device elements 32 . The disclosure provides examples of the present method applied to the fabrication of a MESFET device and a MOSFET device and to isolation and intercon nection of single devices into large circuits on a semicon ductor chip.
