# Method for increasing the modulus of vulcanizable rubber.

## Abstract
This invention is directed toward a method of increasing modulus properties of vulcanizable rubber compositions comprising the step of dispersing from about 0.2 to about 15 parts per 100 parts of rubber in the rubber composition of an organic salt of a transition metal and an organic acid selected from the group consisting of aliphatic and aromatic mono carboxylic acids having from one to about 20 carbon atoms and aliphatic and aromatic dicarboxylic acids having from two to about 22 carbon atoms.
