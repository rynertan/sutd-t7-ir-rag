## Description
VIDEO SIGNAL PROCESSING APPARATUS This invention relates to a video signal processing apparatus used for a video signal recording reproducing apparatus such as a video tape recorder or a video disc player and performing dropout compensation and or line noise cancellation of video signals. Recently, video signal recording reproducing apparatus such as video tape recorders VTR and video disc players have been proposed with a dropout compensating unit which replaces a reproduced video signal containing a dropout by a signal produced from one horizontal 1 H scanning period before on the basis of the line correlation of a television TV picture. Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of a dropout compensating unit which has been previously proposed. A frequency modulated FM video signal reproduced from a reproducing head is fed to an input terminal 1. When the reproduced signal contains no dropout, the signal is passed through an input terminal 7 of an electronic switch 2, and from an output terminal 9 of the electronic switch 2 to a demodulator 5.When the reproduced FM video signal contains a dropout, a dropout detector 3 detects the dropout and controls the switch 2 to connect another input terminal 8 of the switch 2 to the output terminal 9 via a delay line 4. The delay line 4 supplies an output signal to the terminal R which is delayed by one horizontal period 1 H so that the input to terminal 5 is the immediately preceding line signal. Thus the reproduced FM video signal containing a dropout is not applied to the demodulator 5, but instead, the reproduced FM video signal from one line previously is applied to the demodulator 5. Accordingly, the demodulator 5 is always applied with FM video signals containing no dropouts and demodulates and outputs the same at an output terminal 6. However, the 1 H delay line is an analog delay line usually composed of a glass delay line, which is difficult to produce if small in size. Further, when the dropout occupies a period longer than 1 H, the same video signal must be repeatedly circulated around the loop composed of the switch 2 and the 1 H delay line 4 so that it becomes degraded reduced in amplitude and bandwidth due to the non linearity and insertion loss of the 1 H delay line 4. On the other hand, in VTRs, the luminance signal is recorded on a magnetic tape with its frequency modulated.Since the S N ratio of the tape head system is not always sufficient, the S N ratio of the reproduced luminance signal is also often insufficient, and as a result, noise is perceived on the reproduced picture. For improving theS N ratio of the luminance signal, a so called line noise cancelling circuit as shown in Figure 2 has been proposed.Basically, it eliminates unnecessary spectrum by means of a Y type comb filter to improve the S N ratio, making use of the line correlation of the luminance signal.When this is done, a proper measure is provided for preventing deterioration in the vertical resolution of the picture. The frequency modulated luminance signal FMy is fed to one input terminal of a switch 11. The common terminal of the switch 11 is connected to a demodulator 12 and to a 1 H delay line 13. The output of the 1 H delay line 13 is connected to the other input terminal of the switch 11 and to a demodulator 15 through an amplifier 14. The output of the demodulator 15 is applied to a subtraction circuit 17 through an amplitude regulator 16. The output of the demodulator 12 is also applied to the subtraction circuit 17. The output signal of the subtraction circuit 17 is applied to a further subtraction circuit 20 through an attenuator 18 and a limiter 19. The output of the demodulator 12 is also applied to the further subtraction circuit 20.At the output of the subtraction circuit 20 a luminance signal Y out having an improved S N ratio is obtained. In Figure 2, the switch 11, 1 H delay line 13 and amplifier 14 compose a dropout compensator as described above. In a normal state with no dropouts, the switch 11 is positioned as shown in Figure 2, and the input FMy signal is connected to the next stage as it is. If a dropout occurs, the switch 11 is shifted to its other position by a signal indicated by the letters D.O., and the FMy signal is replaced by a signal inputted 1 H before and having no dropout. The insertion loss by the 1 H delay line is compensated by the amplifier 14. The dropout compensated FMy signal is demodulated by the demodulator 12 and applied to the subtraction circuit 17 as the luminance signal of base band. Whereas the FMy signal, which has passed through the 1 H delay line 13 and amplifier 14, is demodulated by the demodulator 15 and turned into the luminance signal of the base band which is delayed by 1 H, and then applied to the subtraction circuit 17 through the amplitude regulator 16. The subtraction circuit 17 forms a C type comb filter against the demodulated luminance signal. When the output of the subtraction circuit 17 is low i.e. correlation of the luminance signal is high , it is within the limited level of the limiter 19 and is applied to the further subtractions circuit 20 as it is.When the output of the subtraction circuit 17 is high i.e. correlation of the luminance signal is low , its amplitude is clipped within a fixed amplitude by the limiter 19 and applied to the subtraction circuit 20. Therefore, the output of the subtraction circuit 20 becomes a signal passed through a Y type comb filter in an area where correlation of the luminance signal is high, so that the S N ratio is improved with noise components reduced. The Y type comb filter is not formed in an area where correlation of the luminance signal is low, because the amplitude is limited by the limiter 19 and the input signal is output as it is. Consequently, vertical resolution is not deteriorated. The attenuator 15 is for adjusting the input level of the subtraction circuit 20 closer to the output level of the demodulator 12, because the amplitude of the C type comb filter which is the output of the subtraction circuit 17 is double the input level. Figure 3 is provided for explaining the operation of the construction of Figure 2 in terms of frequency characteristic. Figure 3 a shows the frequency characteristic when correlation of the input luminance signal is low. It shows that the input luminance signal is outputted as it is . Although the S N ratio is not improved, the vertical resolution of the reproduced picture is not deteriorated. Figure 3 b shows the frequency characteristic when correlation of the input luminance signal is high. This is what is called the characteristic of theY type comb filter which provides gain 1 with respect to the frequency integer times higher than the horizontal scanning frequency fH and gain 0 with respect to the frequency 1 2 line offset odd number times higher than 1 2 H . In this case, noise occurring around the 1 9 line offset frequency points is eliminated, so that the S N ratio is improved. When there is no correlation in the vertical direction of the picture like this, theS N ratio can be improved without deteriorating the vertical resolution, because the comb filter is formed only in an area where correlation appears. The above desc ribed line noise canceller has some defects. First, since the pass band is not of the base band starting from 0 Hz and allows only an RF signal to pass because the 1 H delay line is a glass delay line, it makes a frequency modulated luminance signal pass.Thus, two or more frequency demodulators are required because the output signal of the delay line and the input signal must be demodulated respectively. Second, since the glass delay line has an insertion loss, an amplifier 14 is required to adjust a level up to the input signal level. Third, since the insertion loss of the glass delay line tends to vary widely, an amplitude regulator 16 is required to form the comb filter. Fourth, the frequency characteristic of the pass band of the glass delay line fluctuates greatly, and the fluctuation deteriorates the frequency characteristic of the final luminance signal. Due to this reason, the attenuation rate of the attenuator 18 is normally set low so that the frequency characteristic of the glass delay line will not seriously affect the output.Theoretically, if the attenuation rate is halved, the complete characteristic of the comb filter shown in Figure 3 b can be obtained.Actually, however, since the attenuation rate is quartered so that the output will not be affected by the fluctuation of the frequency characteristic of the 1 H delay line 13, the comb filter characteristic becomes as shown in Figure 3 c , preventing the complete comb filter characteristic from being e btained. This not only reduces the improvement of the Rip ratio, but also cannot sufficiently eliminate cross modulation components of a chroma signal whose spectrum exists at the position of 172 fH line offset. Furthermore, although not shown in the Figure, since the delay time of the glass delay line also varies widely, the delay time of each delay line needs to be adjusted. As described above, since the conventional line noise canceller uses a glass delay line, various measures are required to compensate for its characteristics, resulting in a complicated circuit configuration. The present invention provides a video signal processing apparatus comprising analog to digital converting means for converting an input video signal to a digital signal, digital delay means for delaying the digitised input video signal for a specified period, and signal processing means for selecting or calculating the digitised input video signal and the delayed signal. This apparatus is designed to output the reproduced video signal delayed by the specified period in place of a reproduced video signal containing a dropout. The signal delay of the reproduced video signal is executed by a digital memory which allows compact circuit construction and prevention of signal deterioration even when a longlasting dropout occurs. Further, the apparatus of the invention preferably comprises first calculating means which detects a difference between a digital luminance signal obtained by digitising an input luminance signal and a digital luminance signal delayed by the specified period by the digital delay means, limiting means which limits the amplitude value of the output of the first calculating means after attenuating by a specified rate, and second calculating means which subtracts the output of the limiting means from the digital luminance signal, thereby to reduce noises around the 1 2 offset of the input digital luminance signal.Since the specified period usually 1 H delay is performed by a digital memory, no insertion loss and bandwidth reducing problems occur. As a result, not only can circuit construction be simplified, but also semiconductor production in facilitated, enabling a compact and low cost apparatus. In order that the present invention be more readily understood, embodiments thereof will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a block diagram of a previously proposed dropout compensating apparatus Figure 2 is a block diagram of a circuit of,a previously proposed line noise canceller Figure 3 is a frequency characteristic to explain the operation of the circuit shown in Figure 2 Figure 4 is a schematic block diagram of a main part of an embodiment of a dropout compensator according to this invention Figure 5 is a schematic block diagram of a main part of another embodiment of the dropout compensator according to this invention Figure 6 is a schematic block diagram of a main part of still another embodiment of the dropout compensator according to this invention Figure 7 is a schematic block diagram of a main part of one embodiment of a line noise canceller according to this invention and Figure 8 is a schematic block diagram of a main part of one embodiment of a dropout compensation and line noise cancellation apparatus according to this invention. Referring now to Figure 4, this shows a first embodiment of this invention in which a reproduced FM video signal 21 is fed as an input to a demodulator 22 which demodulates the video signal and feeds the demodulated signal to a low pass filter 24 which eliminates high pass components which are unnecessary for digitising signals. The output of the filter 24 is connected to anA D converter 25 whose output is connected to one input 26a of an electronic switch 26 which is controlled by an output from a dropout detector 23. An output terminal 26c of the switch 26 is connected to a memory 27 which outputs a digital signal delayed by 1 H, to another input terminal 26b of the switch 26.The output terminal 26c is also connected by a D A converter 28 and a lowpass filter 29 which eliminates unnecessary high pass components of an analog signal converted by the D A converter 28, to an output terminal 30. The output from 30 is a dropout compensated signal. When the reproduced video signal input to the input terminal 21 does not contain a dropout, the switch 26 connects the output terminal 26c with the input terminal 26a. After having been demodulated by the demodulator 22, the reproduced video signal has unnecessary high frequency components removed by the low pass filter 24, and the filtered signal is converted to a digital demodulated signal by the A D converter 25, and fed to the output terminal 26c from the input terminal 26a through the switch 26. The digital signal is reconverted to an analog reproduced video signal by the D A converter 28, filtered of unnecessary high frequency components by the low pass filter 29 and output from the output terminal 30. In this process, the digital signal at the output terminal 26c is also stored into the memory 27, and after being delayed by a period of 1 H, appears at the output terminal 27b of the memory 27. On the other hand, when the reproduced video signal at the input terminal 21 contains a dropout, the dropout detector 23 detects the dropout and controls the switch 26 to connect the output terminal 26c with the input terminal 26b. As a result the signal contained in the memory 27 is applied to the D A converter 28 in place of the video signal input at the time. Even when a dropout exceeding 1 H exists, the reproduced signal is delayed by n.H n denoting an integer in digital form without being deteriorated. According to the Figure 4 embodiment, the apparatus can be made more compact than the previously proposed one using a glass delay line as a consequence of using semiconductor production techniques due to the use of a digital memory for the 1 H delay line. Also, a longlasting dropout can be compensated without deterioration of the output signal due to employing a digital form of delay signal. In the Figure 4 embodiment, the demodulator 22 may be placed between the low pass filter 29 and the output terminal 30 with the effects of the circuit unchanged. Figure 5 shows a second embodiment of the invention.In Figure 5, the same parts as are used in Figure 4 are indicated by like reference numerals. The circuit inFigure 5 is basically the same as that shown in Figure 4 with the exception that a further electronic switch 31 is interposed between the output of the D A converter 25 and the low pass filter 29 with the output of theD A converter 29 connected to one input 31b of the switch 31 and the output 41c of the switch 31 connected to the input of the low pass filter 29. The output of the low pass filter 24 is fed to a further input 31a of the switch 31 which is controlled by the output of the dropout detector 23. When the reproduced video signal at input terminal 21 does not contain a dropout, the switch 31 allows the reproduced video signal to pass from the input terminal 31a directly to the output terminal 31c thereof. Therefore, the reproduced video signal is demodulated by the demodulatol 32 and is led to the output terminal 3O through the low pass filter 24 the switch 31 and the low pass filter 29. That is, the reproduced analog signal is directly passed to the output terminal 30 without being digitised. In this process, since the input terminal 26a and the output terminal 26c of the switch 26 are connected to each other, the output signal of the low pass filter 24 is converted to a digital signal by the A D converter 25 and the digital signal is inputted to the 1 H memory 27 through the switch 26. There, it is delayed by 1 H and then, reconverted to an analog signal by means of the D A converter 38 and applied to the input terminal 31b of the switch 31. On the other hand, when the input reproduced video signal has a dropout portion, the input terminal 31b and the output terminal 31c of the switch 31 are connected with each other by the detection signal from the dropout detector 23. As a result, the 1 H delayed signal from the 1 H memory 27 passes through the switch 31, and has unnecessary high frequency components removed by the lowpass filter 29 and output from the output terminal 30.Thus, a dropout can be compensated. In this process, since the input terminal 26b and the output terminal 26c of the switch 26 are connected to each other, the 1 Hdelayed digital signal outputted from the 1 H memory 27 is inputted again to the same 1 H memory 27 through the switch 26. Therefore, signals are not deteriorated even when a long lasting dropout exists. According to the second embodiment of the invention, a desirable reproduced signal can be obtained due to such a construction that allows direct output without digitising the reproduced analog signal when there is no dropout, and the S N ratio is not deteriorated by quantising noise due to the digitisation when there is a dropout. Therefore, the size of the circuit can be reduced because both theA D converter 24 and the D A converter 28 can be of low resolution. Figure 6 shows a third embodiment of the invention which is a modification to the second embodiment and hence the same reference numerals as appear is in Figures 5 and 6 represent the same parts. The main difference betweenFigures 5 and 6 are that in Figure 6 the low pass filters 24 and 29 are removed from the main signal path from the input 21 to the output 30 and are placed in the dropout compensation signal path. This is achieved by the low pass filter 25 receiving an output from the demodulator which output is also fed directly to one input 31a of the further switch 31. Further, the low pass filter 29 is placed between the D A converter 28 and the switch 31 such that the output of the filter 29 is fed to the other input 31b of the switch 31 whose output is directly connected to the output 30. Further, the 1 H memory 27 is now in the form of a shift register having an input 27a for receiving the output of the switch 26, an output 27b connected to the input 26b of the switch 26, and an intermediate tap output terminal 27c which is connected to the input of the D A converter 28. The intermediate tap output terminal 27c of the shift register 27 is located so that the signal input to the low pass filter 24 is delayed by just 1 H by the time it is outputted from the low pass filter 29. In this embodiment, when the reproduced video signal input to the input terminal 21 does not contain a dropout, the reproduced video signal is fed to the output terminal 30 through the input terminal 31a of the switch 31 after being demodulated by the demodulator 22. Therefore, the signal appearing at the output terminal 30 is a desirable reproduced video signal without being digitised or band limited. The signal demodulated by the demodulator 22 is also limited by the low pass filter 24, and convert to a digital signal by the and converter 25.The digital signal is delayed by the 1 H shift register 27 after passing through the switch 26, output from the intermediate tap output terminal 27c, and reconverted to the analog signal by the D A converter 2b. The reconverted analog signal unnecessary high frequency components removed by the low pass filter 29, and is applied to the input terminal 31b of the switch 31. Since the intermediate tap output terminal 27c of the shift register 27 is located at a position where it compensates for the time delay to the signal caused by the low pass filters 24 and 29, the A D converter 25 and the D A converter 25, the signal at the input terminal 31b is equivalent to one obtained by delaying the signal at the input terminal 31a by exactly 1 H. The bandwidth of the dropout compensating signal may be limited to about 1.5 MHz without causing visual problems. Consequently, by limiting the frequency band using the low pass filters 24 and 29, the size and power consumption of the circuit from the A D converter 25 to the D A converter 28 can be reduced. On the other hand, when the reproduced video signal input to the input terminal 21 contains a dropout, the dropout detector 23 detects the dropout and controls the switch 31 by its detection signal so as to pass the signal at the input terminal 31b to the output terminal 30. That is, the 1 H delayed signal from the 1 H shift register 27 is output from the output terminal 30, so that the dropout is compensated. During this process, since the switch 26 is so positioned to lead the signal at the output terminal 27b of the 1 H shift register 27 to the input terminal of the same 1 H shift register 27, the 1 H delayed digital signal output from the output terminal 27b of the 1 H shift register 27 is again fed to the 1 H shift register 27 again through the switch 26.Even if a dropout exceeding 1 H occurred, the repeatedly delayed signal will not be deteriorated because it is delayed as a digital signal. The advantages of the third embodiment of the invention, are that size of the circuit comprising such as the A D converter, memory e.g. shift register andD A converter and the power consumed in the circuit can be reduced. Furthermore, a time delay caused by such as the low pass filters can be compensated by the use employment of shift register having an intermediate tape as the memory. Furthermore, when a long lasting dropout occurs, signal deterioration can be avoided by repeatedly delayed digital 1 H delayed signal. Although the shift register is used as the memory in the third embodiment, the same effects as above can be also obtained by another construction e.g. the switch 47 and the shift register 45 may be replaced by a RAM which can store a 1 H digital signal, the reading addresses being shorter than the writing addresses corresponding to the 1 H digital signal by the time delay caused by A such as the low pass filters. The writing operation is stopped when a dropout is detected to hold the signal occurring 1 H before, which is read out and used to compensate for the dropout. To summarise the effects of the above embodiments, the present invention can make the apparatus compact by making the dropout compensation circuit including the digital memory used for delaying the reproduced video signal as a semiconductor chip or chips. Furthermore, a long lasting dropout can be compensated without signal deterioration by repeatedly delaying the digital signal by circulating or holding it. Also, a reproduced video signal, without being digitised can be directly output when no dropout occurs. In other words, dropout compensation by the digitised signal is performed only when a dropout occurs. The circuit scale can be reduced by employing an A D converter of comparatively rough resolution.Further, since the frequency band of the delayed signal is limited by the low pass filters, not only the scale of the circuit comprised of A D converter,D A converter, and memory, but also the power consumed in the circuit can be reduced. The time delay caused by such as A D and D A converters, and the low pass filters can be easily compensated by using the memory which can output a signal which was delayed by a period time delay than 1 H. Figure 7 shows a schematic block diagram of a line noise canceller for the luminance signal as an embodiment of the invention. A frequency modulated luminance signal FMy reproduced from a recording medium passes through a demodulator 61 and is converted to a digital signal by an A D converter 62. The digital signal is applied to subtraction circuits difference calculation circuits 64 and 67, and a 1 H memory 63. The output of the 1 H memory 63 is fed to the subtraction circuit 64. The output of the subtraction circuit 64 is applied to the subtraction circuit 67 through an attenuator 65 and a limiter 66. The output of the subtraction circuit 67 is applied to a D A converter 68, from which the processed luminance signal YotJT is output. The base band luminance signal is demodulated by the demodulator 61, and converted to a digital signal by the AD converter 62. The digitalised luminance signal is delayed by 1 H in the 1 H memory 63. Since the 1 H memory 63 is a digital memory such as a shift register or a random access memory RAM or a combination of the two, it can be an ideal delay element which is not theoretically accompanied by attenuation of the amplitude, fluctuations of the frequency characteristic or time error, and has no irregularity. The 1 H memory 63 and the subtraction circuit 64 form a C type comb filter.The output of the C type comb filter is reduced in level by the attenuator 65 so that the amplitude is halved.This can be easily achieved by shifting the digital signal by 1 bit lower. Since the 1 H memory 63 is not accompanied by the fluctuation of the frequency characteristic, the attenuation rate of the attenuator 65 can be set at exactly 1 2. The output of the attenuator 65 is limited in amplitude by the limiter 66 in such a way that only the lower bits of the digital signal are passed to the next stage. The output of the limiter 66 is applied to the subtraction circuit 67. The output signal of the subtraction circuit 67 shows a characteristic as if having passed through aY type comb filter when the output signal level of the subtraction circuit 64 is small. On the other hand, when the output signal level of the subtraction circuit 64 is large, the output signal of the A D converter 62 appears as it is at the output of the subtraction circuit 67. Therefore, the reconverted analog signal at the output of the D A converter 68 becomes as shown inFigure 3 a or b .Therefore, the S N ratio is improved by the Y type comb filter in an area where the correlation of the input luminance signal is high, whereas the input luminance signal is output as it is in an area where the correlation of the input luminance signal is low, thus satisfying the function as a line noise canceller that the picture is not deteriorated in the vertical direction. Some features of the embodiment of Figure 7 will be described below compared with the conventional example in Figure 2. First, since the digitised base band luminance signal can be delayed by 1 H only one demodulator 61 may be provided for demodulating the frequencymodulated luminance signal. Second, the amplitude compensatilag amplifier is not required because the 1 H memory 63 does not cause an insertion loss. In addition, since the amplitude does not vary at all, the level controller is not required before the subtraction circuit 64. Third, since the frequency characteristic of the 1 H memory 63 does not fluctuate, the attenuation rate of the attenuator 65 can be set at 1 2 to meet the theory.Accordingly, it is possible to adjust the characteristic of the comb filter so that the minimum gain may become 0 as shown in Figure 3 b . Putting together the first and second features and the fact that processing is all done digitally, it is possible to make the apparatus compact and decrease the cost due to simplification and semiconductorisation of the circuit. The third feature is related to performance. Considering that the S N ratio can be improved more than the conventional analog type and that especially the cross modulation component of the chroma signal is of 1 2 line offset and exist at the valley of the Y type comb filter characteristic, there is a considerable difference in the effects of reduction of the cross modulation components. Figure 5 shows a block diagram of another embodiment of the invention in which like reference numerals identify like parts in Figures 7 and 5. This embodiment has a dropout compensating function in addition to the line noise cancelling function in Figure 7. The 1 H memory 63 is commonly used for both functions. The digital luminance signal outputted from the A D converter 62 is applied to an input terminal 69a of a switch 9. The other input terminal 69b of the switch 69 is connected with the output terminal of the 1 H memory 63 which delays the signal at a common terminal 69c of the switch 69 by 1 H.When no dropout occurs, the digital luminance signal from the t D converter 62 appears at the common terminal 69c of the switch 69 as it is, and it is applied to the line noise canceller. When a dropout occurs, the switch 69 is changed over by a D.O signal produced by a dropout detector not shown in the figure , so that the 1 H delayed signal from the 1 H memory is applied to the line noise canceller. In this case, the dropout compensated signal is the digitised luminance signal of the base band. What are superior to the conventional example shown inFigure 2 are that level adjustment and time adjustment are not required, and that phase noises are not caused when changing over the switch 69. As is clear from the above description, this invention not only eliminates the defects of the conventionally used glass delay line by making a 1 H memory cause a delay of one horizontal scanning period after converting the luminance signal into a digital signal, but also carries out the functioning of the line noise cancellation and dropout compensation without fine adjustment with a simple construction. Especially, combined with the points that only one demodulator is necessary, that an insertion loss compensating amplifier is not necessary, that level adjustment and time adjustment of the comb filter are not necessary, and that semiconductorisation is easy because all signals are processed digitally, this invention is very effective in realisation of a compact and low cost signal processing apparatus for video signal recording reproducing apparatus. Furthermore, since this invention enables ideal comb filter characteristics which could not be realised bv the conventional line noise canceller, it contributes to a large improvement in the S N ratio and elimination of cross modulation components of the chroma signal.
