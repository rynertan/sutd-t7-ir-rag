# Self turnoff type semiconductor switching device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor switching device 1 includes first to fourth layers P1, N1, P2, N2 , a first gate portion 3 , a second gate portion 4 and a common gate terminal 5 interconnecting the first and second gate portions 3, 4 . The first gate portion 3 is the current control type and has a rectifying PN junction, and the second gate portion 4 is the voltage control type. When a first polarity bias voltage is applied to the common gate terminal 5 , the device 1 turns on through the second gate portion 4 , while it turns off through the first gate portion when a second polarity bias voltage is applied to the terminal 5 .
