# Improved process and apparatus for coating paper.

## Abstract
A process for effecting the high speed coating as herein defined of both sides of a lightweight paper sheet as herein defined with coatings of low dry coatweight as herein de fined , whilst maintaining good coating pattern and control over the degree of curl in the sheet when dried, comprising the steps of moving an endless transfer surface sequentially through first, second and third stations, at first station, forming on said transfer surface a smooth continuous film of a first coating mix having a predeter mined fluid content and rheology, at the second station, bringing a first side of said paper sheet into contact with said transfer surface and simulta neously subjecting the sheet to pressure against said transfer surface without substantial sheet distortion, so as to promote substantially complete absorption by the sheet of the solvent or dispersion medium of the first coating mix whilst in engagement with the transfer surface and prior to passage of the sheet and transfer surface through the third station, at the third station, applying to the second side of the sheet and second cotating mix having a predetermined fluid con tent and rheology optionally differing from that of the first coating mix, and separating the sheet from the transfer surface for drying.
