# A swivelling bin filling conveyor.

## Abstract
A swivelling bin filling conveyor comprising a frame 1 including two main wheels 3 and a nosewheel assembly 2 , on which frame 1 there is mounted a conveyor 4 extending obliquely upwardly from said frame, and which is further fitted with a foot 7 resting, in operation, on the ground. Said foot 7 is adapted for rotation relative to said frame 1 about a vertical axis 8 lying in the median perpendicular plane of the connecting line between the axles of the two main wheels 3 . Said main wheels 3 are each adapted to be brought from the normal position of travel into a swivelling operating position transverse to the connecting line between the vertical axis and the axle 8 of the respective main wheel 3 . Each of the two main wheels 3 includes a separately energizable drive motor 32, 33 . Means are provided for ensuring that at least in the swivelling operating position only the rear main wheel 3 , as viewed in the direction of movement of the bin filling conveyor, is driven.
