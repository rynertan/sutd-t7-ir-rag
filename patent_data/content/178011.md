# Robot with power laser beam.

## Abstract
An industrial robot with power laser beam for the cutting or welding of workpieces according to a desired pattern. The robot has six axes of movement if desired a seventh axis can be provided and a triaxial hollow head. The laser beam is generated by a generator 1 separate and outside the robot and reaches the robot through a side opening 12, 12 whereafter it is axially directed by a pair of adjustable mirrors 15, 20 to the hollow head 7 . Two further mirrors 24, 25 fitted in the head direct the beam perpendicularly on the workpiece to be cut or welded, according to the desired path.
