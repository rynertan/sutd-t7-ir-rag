# Low pressure signal driven flow control system.

## Abstract
A hydraulic system including a bidirectional hydraulic motor 10 having first and second fluid ports, a pump 58 , a control valve 20 for selectively connecting the pump to a the first port and venting the second port and b the second port and venting the first port, a modulating valve 100 interposed between the pump and the control valve for varying flow from the pump to the control valve, a pilot for the modulating valve, and a resolver 118 for selecting the lowest pressure at the motor ports and for directing a fluid signal proportional thereto to the pilot to control the modulating valve.
