# Display apparatus employing stroke generators.

## Abstract
In a cathode ray tube display system of the type utilising stroke techniques, the display refresh rate is allowed to decrease from a specified maximum in order to ensure that all stroke information is displayed. When the cathode ray tube display system further includes a raster symbol gener ator, the display refresh rate varies as a function of a fixed raster time interval and a variable stroke time interval.
