# Injection of anti idiotype to elecit immune response to infectious viral agents.

## Abstract
Anti ID antibodies modulate the immune response to HBsAg. Injection of anti ID antibodies alone induce anti HBs that are directed against the a determinant and inhibit a common interspecies anti HBs ID anti ID reaction. In addition, anti ID treatment prior to HBsAg on synthetic peptide stimulation enhance the anti HBs response. Thus, the immune response to HBV may be controlled via idiotype networks with anti ID antibodies as vaccine candidates by modulating the immune response to an infections viral agent.

## Description
INJECTION OF ANTI IDIOTYPE TO ELICIT IMMUNE RESPONSE TO INFECTIOUS VIRAL AGENTS The invention described herein was made during the course of work under grants from the National Heart,Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, and the United States Army Medical Research and DevelopmentCommand. Cross References to Related Applications None. Prior Art Statement and Background of the Invention The following is an explanation of the background of the present invention together with a listing which, in the opinion of the Applicants, sets forth the closest prior art of which the Applicants are aware. A concise explantion of the relevance of the more important items is included. Viral hepatitis has assumed significant world wide epidemic proportions. It is estimated that there are two hundred million carriers of hepatitis B virus HBV worldwide. The development of a conventional vaccine has been hampered by the inability to grow hepatitis B virus in tissue culture As a result, it has been necessary to produce hepatitis B subunit particle vaccines by isolating and purifying the 22 nm lipoprotein particles composed of hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg from plasmas of asympotomatic human carriers. However, such formalin or heat inactivated vaccines have the disadvantages of substantial expense and limited supply. In addition, such a source presents potential hazards in view of unknown factors that may be present in the plasma. Also, as high risk populations are immunized, sources of plasma containing large quantities of HBsAg will become scarce. The concept that the immune response to an antigen can be regulated via an idiotype network was first proposed by Niels Jerne in 1974. Idiotypes distinct antigenic determinants , located on or close to the antigen binding site of both antibody molecules and lymphocyte antigen receptors, are the components of this network. Within this framework a series of idiotype anti idiotype reactions may potentiate or suppress the network and control the immune response of an individual to antigen. Some theoretical implications of anti idiotype antibodies as potential vaccines for infectious agents have been discussed by A. Nisonoff andE. Lamoyi. Anti idiotypes that recognize the antigenbinding site of idiotype molecules share structural homologies with the antigen that induced the idiotype.Therefore, anti idiotypes secondary antibodies may represent an internal image of the antigen so that injection of antiidiotypes may induce primary antibodies idiotype without classical antigenic stimulation. As pointed out above, the possibility of antiidiotype antibodies as potential vaccines for infectious agents have been suggested previously. The following is a list of references relating to such vaccines or processes with respect thereto and which will be referred to herein by respective reference numbers. 1. Kunkel,H.G,, M.

Nature 304, 699 703 1983 . The observation of a unique antigenic determinant located on or close to the antigen combining site of a specific antibody molecule was originally reported in references 1 and 2. This determinant was termed an immunoglobulin idiotype ID . ID, along with homologous anti ID antibodies was theorized to be components of a network of complex reactions that regulate a given immune response as originally reported in reference 3. References 4, 5 and 6 suggest several of the theoretical implications involved with the possible use of anti ID antibodies as potential vaccines for infectious diseases. A.number of studies with experimental model systems have illustrated the applicability of the above concepts that anti ID antibodies can manipulate the immune response.Injection of anti ID antibodies followed at a later date with injection of antigen has resulted in either suppression of ID positive antigen binding molecules references 7 9 or an increased ID expression and antigenbinding activity references 10 15 . The impetus to study idiotypes associated with antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen anti HBs came from the knowledge that anti HBs was protective against HBV infection. We initially generated four rabbit anti idiotype antisera against affinity purified anti HBs from two different individuals. Each of the four anti idiotype reagents detected a common anti HBs idiotype reference No. 16 . A single anti idiotype antiserum was selected for further study. The common human idiotype was detected in purified anti HBs from three individuals and also in anti HBs positive sera obtained from six hemophilic patients. The ability of both HBsAg and a virus derived HBsAg native polypeptide to inhibit the idiotype anti idiotype reaction suggested the anti HBs idiotype was associated with the antibody combining site.Idiotype determinants were detected because the antiidiotype antisera did not interact effectively with IgG preparations from i the idiotype donor after removal of anti HBs ii a pool of human sera negative for anti HBs and iii an individual with a high level of antibody to herpes simplex virus. Attesting further to the idiotypic specificity was the inability of the anti idiotype to bind either HBsAg or the native HBsAg derived polypeptide. These data indicated that we were detecting an antibody combining site associated, common human anti HBs idiotype ReferenceNo. 16 . Further characterization of the common idiotype revealed that it was induced by the group a determinant because three HBsAg preparations purified from three pools of human plasma positive for HBsAg adw, ayw or adr subtypes inhibited the idiotype anti idiotype reaction equally on a weight basis. Figure 1. We also tested the ability ofHBsAg derived polypeptides to inhibit the idiotype antiidiotype reaction and found that sodium dodecyl sulfatedenatured HBsAg viral polypeptides virtually lost their capacity to inhibit when compared to the native polypeptides. Also reduction of the disulfide bonds and alkylation of free thiol groups destroyed the ability of the native HBsAgderived polypeptide to inhibit the idiotype anti idiotype reaction. These data suggested that the common anti HBs idiotype was directed against a conformation dependent group specific a epitope Reference No. 17 . We have recently characterized the expression of the common idiotype on anti HBs produced in rabbits, guinea pigs, swine, goats, chimpanzees, and BALB c mice that had been immunized with HBsAg. Expression of the idiotype in sera from the various species was associated with anti HBs molecules. We also determined that anti HBs from chickens successfully immunized with HBsAg failed to express the common idiotype Reference No. 18 . We tested the ability of a cyclic synthetic peptides that contained amino acid residues 122 137 Peptide 1 and 117 137 Peptide 2 analogous to P25 to inhibit the common idiotype anti idiotype reaction. Figure 2. On a molar basis these peptides were 103 fold less efficient than intact HBsAg in inhibiting the idiotype anti idiotype reaction.The inability of the peptides to compete equally on a molar basis with HBsAg indicates that this peptide does not represent the complete a determinant and suggests other amino acid sequences are also important in defining the complete a epitope. The inhibition of the idiotype anti idiotype reaction by cyclic peptide 122 137 suggests that this sequence is related to antigenic determinants responsible for eliciting a population of human anti HBs expressing a common idiotype. The importance of conformation was again demonstrated by reducing the disulfide bond in peptide 1 and alkylating the free thiol groups. This destroyed the ability of peptide 1 to inhibit the idiotype anti idiotype reaction Reference No. 19 .We have shown that mouse monoclonal antibodies which react with cyclic peptide 122137 also inhibit the ID anti ID reaction whereas anti HBs monoclonal which do react with the cyclic peptide fail to inhibit the ID anti ID reaction Reference No. 20 . Detailed description of the prepartion of anti ID antibodies and their characterization are given in referenceNo. 21. The only other experimental evidence to our knowledge that anti ID can induce protective immunity against an infectious agent has been reported for African trypanosomiasis in mice References 22 and 23 . These workers used mouse monoclonal anti ID reagents. Reference 24 is a description of. priming an immune response to polio virus by prior injection of a polio synthetic peptide.

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment Rabbit immunoglobulin G IgG anti serum to the idiotype was exhaustively adsorbed to remove isotypic and allotypic antibodies prior to affinity purification by acid elution from a CNBr activated Sepharose 4B column coupled to the common human anti HBs idiotype. The anti idiotype nature of this rabbit antiserum has been described previously. An IgG fraction obtained from the serum of the rabbit before injection of the idiotype served as a control antibody preparation. We determined the antibody concentration of the two preparations in a spectrophotometer at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 15 for a 1 percent preparation. For the immunogen, we used nondenatured HBsAgderived polypeptide, isolated as highly antigenic micelles. To quantitate the anti HBs immune response at the cellular level, Jerne hemolytic plaque assays were performed in which IgM secreting cells were measured by direct plaques and IgG secreting cells by indirect plaques. Briefly tannic acid treated sheep red blood cells SRBC were coated withHBsAg subtype ayw and used as the indicator cells in the plaque assay. Passive hemagglutination was used with mouse anti HBs to ensure the presence of HBsAg on the SRBC.Spleen cell suspensions from immunized BALB c mice were mixed with HBsAg coated SRBC in agarose. After incubation for one hour at 3750 C., SRBC adsorbed guinea pig complement was added. After two hours at 370C., the direct hemolytic plaques due to secretion of IgM antibodies were counted and the number of PFU per spleen was calculated from the total number of cells per spleen. Indirect plaques due to IgGsecreting cells were determined by adding a serum containing rabbit antibodies to mouse IgG prior to the addition of complement. Both uncoated SRBC and tannic acid treated SRBC coated with ovalbumin served as controls in each experiment. To establish the time interval after HBsAg injection when an optimal anti HBs response was noted, it was necessary to determine the kinetics of the anti HBs PFU response. In the first experiment reported graphically inFigure 4, BALB c mice were immunized with 40 pg of purified antibodies to the idiotype in saline and then, 7 days later, with 5 pg of HBsAg. Three animals were killed at 4, 10, and 14 days after the HBsAg injection, the spleens were removed, and the number of PFU per spleen was determined. From the data in Figure 4, it was apparent that the direct anti HBsPFU response did not differ significantly at the three time intervals examined however, no indirect plaques were detected on day 4. That the anti HBs secreting cells were specific was demonstrated by the fact that no direct or indirect plaques were detected with either uncoated or ovalbumin coated SRBC at any of the three time intervals.Fourteen days after the mice received their final inoculum was the time interval selected to perform the remaining experiments. Five groups of BALB c mice were treated with antibodies to the idiotype, IgG from nonimmunized rabbits, or HBsAg, and their spleen cells were assayed for PFU response 14 days after the final injection. Injection of antibodies to the idiotype prior to HBsAg exposure generated a significantly higher number of direct PFU 531 as opposed to 183 when compared to mice inoculated with IgG from nonimmunized rabbits based on a two tail t test, P 0.05 Table 1 . TABLE 1. Anti HBs response expressed as PFU mean standard error of the mean per spleen. Each group of six mice received 40 pg of antibody to the idiotype or IgG from a nonimmunized rabbit pre IgG or 5 pg of HBsAg on day 0, followed by the indicated injections on day 7, all by the intraperitoneal route.Spleens were removed on day 21. Cells from each mouse spleen were assayed in duplicate for the presence of both direct and indirect anti HBs PFU. No hemolytic plaques were obtained with any spleen cells when uncoated or ovalbumin coated SRBC were used as controls. First Second Number Direct Direct injection injection of IgM IgG Mice secreting secreting cells cells Antibody toIdiotype HBsAg 7 531 94 178 29Pre IgG HBsAg 8 183 65 125 36Antibody to Antibody to idiotype idiotype 6 66.7 47.8 100 29Pre IgG Pre IgG 6 16.7 16.7 8.3 8.3HBsAg HBsAg 6 167 36 1683 168 One mouse died during the experiment. Statistical methods, including the two tail Student s t test and a single factor analysis of variance by ranks test, the Kruskal Wallis test, also indicated direct PFU obtained in the group receiving antibody to idiotype before HBsAg was significantly different from all other groups of mice at P 0.05.The increase in the mean direct PFU detected in the second group of mice receiving antibodies to the idiotype beforeHBsAg injection Table 1 appears to reflect an increase in sample size when compared to the time interval experiment Figure 4 531 from Table 1 as opposed to 450 from Table 4 . The numbers of indirect PFU obtained in mice that received antibodies to the idiotype or preimmune IgG prior to HBsAg were ten times lower when compared to mice given two injections of HBsAg. However, the group receiving both antibodies to the idiotype and HBsAg did produce a higher number of direct PFU when compared to the group given HBsAg only 531 compared to 167 Kruskal Wallis, P 0.05 .The number of indirect IgG anti HBs PFU per spleen in the group receiving two HBsAg injections was on the same order of magnitude as those numbers reported for PFU per spleen in secondary responses to HBsAg and other viral antigens, thus giving validity to our hemolytic plaque assay as a method for quantitating anti HBs secreting cells. Injection of antibodies to idiotype alone increased by 12 times the number of indirect PFU with anti HBs specificity when compared to mice that received only preimmune IgG 100 compared to 8.3 Kruskal Wallis, P 0.05 Table 1 . Although the number of direct PFU was higher in the mice that were injected with antibodies to idiotype alone, the number was not significantly different from that obtained with the group treated with nonimmunized rabbit IgG P 0.1 . The specificity of the PFU response was again demonstrated as no plaques were detected with either uncoated or ovalbumincoated SRBC in either the direct or indirect assay. The reason for the detection of anti HBs PFU in only one of six mice that received nonimmunized rabbit IgG for both injections is now known however, this resulted in the standard error and the mean being equal.The numbers of direct and indirect PFU from the one mouse in this group were low and are probably not meaningful. Although the standard deviation also exceeded the mean for direct PFU in groups treated with either antibodies to idiotype alone or with nonimmunized rabbit IgG and HBsAg, single factor analysis of variance by ranks Kruskal Wallis test indicated that mean ranks of direct PFU differed significantly P 0.005 from the group receiving antibodies to idiotype and HBsAg. Such analysis was necessary because of the heterogeneity of the variances within the individual groups. The significance levels obtained by both the parametric two tail Student s t test and the nonparametric KruskalWallis test were consistent. Thus the injection of antibodies to idiotype enhanced the anti HBs response at the cellular level. An increased number of IgM anti HBs secreting cells was obtained by injecting antibodies to the idiotype before antigen exposure. The reason for the increase of cells secreting IgM, but not those secreting IgG, is not known.However, it may reflect the recruitment, by the antibodies to the idiotype, of accessory cells that aid in the induction of a primary anti HBs response, thus increasing the number of IgM anti HBs secreting cells. Consequently, the presence of anti ID induced anti HBs activity in serum of BALB c mice was investigated to ascertain whether these antibodies expressed an interspeciesID that would be indicative of an ID anti ID controlled network. The first experiment was performed to determine the most immunogenic form s of anti ID antibodies for enhancing the anti HBs response. Our previous study used soluble anti ID antibodies in the modulation of the murine anti HBs response at the spleen cell level however, other investigators demonstrated that high levels of antibody could be induced in their ID systems without antigen stimulation by injecting cross linked anti ID. Because higher titers of anti HBs were generated in experimental animals when HBsAg was alum precipitated rather than in aqueous solution, compared the effects on the anti HBs response by injecting alum precipitated material versus soluble anti ID antibodies prior to HBsAg stimulation.As shown in Table 2, the mean anti HBs titer was higher in groups of mice receiving alum precipitated anti ID when compared to anti ID in saline prior to HBsAg injection solid phase radioimmunoassay, AUSAB, Abbott Laboratories, N. Chicago, I1. AUSAB titers of 487.5 versus 72.5 . Only 1 of 4 mice produced a detectable anti HBs response in the soluble control pre IgG group, whereas no mice receiving alumprecipitated pre IgG prior to HBsAg produced a detectable anti liBS response at a 1 5 serum dilution Table 2 . In this experiment, the anti HBs response was measured by both a commercial RIA which detects IgM and IgG anti HBs and a solid phase RIA. For the remaining experiments the solid phase RIA was used for titration of the mouse antisera, because this test is more sensitive, less expensive, and requires lower quantities of serum 50 p1 versus 200 ul when compared to the AUSAB. It was noteworthy that primarily IgM anti HBs was detected by an IgM type specific RIA in the group of mice injected with the soluble anti ID preparation. This was similar to the observations described above where the number of direct IgM anti HBs PFU was enhanced by prior injection of soluble anti ID.

Mice were bled on day 26.2 The values are the reciprocal dilution of antisera which gave an endpoint S N of 2.1 as measured by AUSAB.3 The mean value of reciprocal dilution of antisera which gave an endpoint S N of 2.1 as measured by solid phase RIA using 125I labeled goat anti mouse gamma chain specific antiserum.4 The mean value of reciprocal dilution of antisera which gave an endpoint S N of 2.1 as measured by solid phase RIA using 125I labeled rabbit anti mouse chain specific antiserum.5 All mice were negative for anti HBs at a serum dilution of 1 5. In the second set of experiments, the optimal time interval between a primary injection of alum precipitated antiID antibodies and a subsequent HBsAg inoculum for enhancing the anti HBs response was determined. Only IgG anti HBs was measured since alum precipitated anti ID generated a potent secondary IgG response to HBsAG. In the previous experiment, the alum precipitated anti ID treated mice generated a 4fold higher IgG anti HBs titer when compared to IgM Table 2 . Also, previous observations in reference to the secondary humoral anti HBs response indicated that IgG was the predominant antibody class present between 10 and 20 days afterHBsAg boost. For these reasons, serum was routinely obtained 12 days after HBsAg injection and only IgG anti HBs was assayed in the remainder of the study.Based on the data presented in Table 3, the optimal anti HBs response occurred when HBsAg was given 14 days after priming with anti ID. In each instance, groups of mice that received anti ID antibodies prior to HBsAg generated a higher antiHBs response when compared to the mice given pre IgG. The extremely high standard errors of the mean table in Table 3 resulted from both the small sample size n 4 and the individual variations in anti HBs titer among mice.

Mice were bled 12 days after injection with HBsAg.2 The values are the reciprocal dilution of antiserum which gave an endpoint S N of 2.1 as measured by the IgG anti HBs solid phase RIA.3 All mice were negative for anti HBs at a serum dilution of 1 5. The optimal quantity of anti ID required for enhancement of the anti HBs response was determined in the next experiment Table 4 . Based on the two tailed Student s t test, the greatest significant difference p 0.001 of the anti HBs titer was noted in that group of mice inoculated with 50 yg of alum precipitated anti ID versus pre IgG prior to HBsAg stimulation. Significant differences were also obtained in the groups of mice injected with 5 and 200 iig of anti ID when compared to control groups inoculated with similar doses of pre IgG. Although the mean anti HBs titer was higher in the group treated with 50 pg of anti ID when compared to the groups given 5 or 200 ug of anti ID the difference was not statistically significant.The reasons for this higher mean anti HBs titer again may have reflected the small sample size n 4 and the individual variation of mice. No significant difference was noted in the antiHBs response between the groups of mice receiving 500 ng of either anti ID or pre IgG prior to HBsAg P 0.2 . Also, the mean anti HBs titer was lower when compared to groups of mice receiving higher quantities of anti ID. Due to the heterogeneity of the variances among the groups receiving different antibody concentrations prior to antigenic stimulation, the reciprocal arithmetic mean anti HBs titers were expressed as values to logo to facilitate the use of the parametric Student s t test rather than a nonparametric test i.e., Kruskal Wallis for the calculations of significance.It is noteworthy that some mice which received pre IgG before HBsAg produced an IgG anti HBs response Table 4 .The reasons for such a response are not known. However, it was consistent throughout the different experiments among the individual groups treated with pre IgG. Based on the data presented in Table 4, 50 pg of anti ID was selected as the optimal dose for generating anti HBs in further experiments.

To facilitate the computations the reciprocal of the titer was considered 0.5, assuming that greater than 2 fold concentration of the sample would give a positive result.4 Determined by the two tailed Student s t test. Previously see above , we demonstrated thatBALB c mice receiving anti ID antibodies alone generated indirect IgG anti HBs PFU. These data indicated that antiID antibodies could induce an anti HBs response withoutHBsAg stimulation. Based on the information established from the above experiments Tables 2 4 , we attempted to induce anti HBs in the serum of BALB c mice by injecting anti ID alone.A statistically significant IgG anti HBs response was generated in mice receiving two injections of 50 pg of alum precipitated anti ID when compared to mice given similar injections of pre IgG p 0.001 Table 5 .

These data indicate that anti ID alone can produce detectable humoral anti HBs in BALB c mice. Figure 3.Analysis of the anti ID induced anti HBs demonstrated the expression of the interspecies ID Table 5 . In this regard, four sera containing anti HBs generated by anti ID induction inhibited the ID anti ID reaction from 38 to 54 , whereas less than 10 inhibition was obtained with the nonanti HBs containing sera from the 4 mice injected with preIgG. In addition, all four preimmune sera from the mice that produced anti HBs by anti ID injection inhibited the binding of the ID to its anti ID antiserum by less than 10 .Together, these data indicate that in vivo administration of anti ID antibodies in BALB c mice induced anti HBs that expressed a similar interspecies ID. This interspecies ID was also detected in anti HBs positive mice that received either anti ID or pre IgG prior to HBsAg Table 6 .

Mice were bled on day 26.2 Reciprocal dilution of antisera that gave a positive S to negative N cpm ratio of 2.1. It was of interest that anti HBs from the four mice receiving anti ID prior to HBsAg inhibited the idiotypeanti idiotype reaction to a greater degree t32 61 when compared to anti HBs from two of the four mice given pre IgG prior to HBsAg. Although this greater amount of inhibition of the idiotype anti idiotype reaction may have reflected higher concentrations of anti HBs in the mice treated with anti ID, previous studies indicated that the level of interspecies ID inhibition was not related to the anti HBs titer.The two mice that received pre IgG prior to HBsAg and failed to produce a detectable anti HBs response inhibited the idiotype anti idiotype reaction by 5 . Serologically, HBsAg contains a group common antigenic reactivity referred to as the a determinant and two sets of allelic subtype determinants d or Z and w or r.In this regard, four possible HBsAg subtypes have been recognized a t ayw, , adr and ayr. The antibody speci ficity of the anti ID induced anti HBs response in terms of which HBsAg determinants were recognized was determined by radioimmunoassay RIA using microtiter plates coated withHBsAg subtypes adw, ayw, and adr. Each of the four anti ID induced anti HBs bound equally well the three differentHBsAg subtypes Table 7 indicating that the reactivities of the anti ID induced anti HBs were directed to the a determinant. See also Figure 1 . This substantiates our previous observation in that the binding of anti ID antibodies was equally inhibited by preincubating the anti HBs ID with three of the four HBsAg subtypes, indicating that the a determinant was responsible for the induction of the ID.The fact that the anti ID induced anti HBs recognized the group specific a determinant of HBsAg lends evidence that anti ID antibodies can induce protective immunity against infectious HBV. In this light, it was demonstrated that antibodies directed against the a determinant confer protection in humans against HBV infection. No significant binding to the three HBsAg subtypes was obtained with sera from the 4 mice that received two injections of pre IgG alone.

A major problem associated with synthetic HBsAg peptides involves their relatively weak immunogenicity. A weak primary antibody response to HBsAg anti HBs was induced in mice inoculated with an uncoupled cyclic synthetic peptide containing amino acid sequences 122 137 peptide 1 .This immune response was not boosted upon subsequent injections of the uncoupled peptide. Weak anti HBs induction has characterized the responses in animals inoculated with otherHBsAg peptides, even when coupled to various carrier proteins to increase immunogenicity. To our knowledge, the only study that has induced high titered anti HBs to synthetic peptides comparable to that of HBsAg particles involved the injection of mice with an alum precipitated cyclic peptide 1 that was linked to tetanus toxoid. The idea that the immune response to an antigen can be regulated via an idiotype anti idiotype network was first proposed by Jerne Reference No. 3 . In the study of the anti HBs response in mice, we examined the effect of the in vivo administration of anti idiotype antibodies prior to a single injection of cyclic peptide 1. Based on the data shown in Table 8, BALB c mice treated with anti idiotype antibodies prior to injection of cyclic peptide 1 generated a higher mean anti HBs titer 38.6 as opposed to 4.0 when compared to mice injected with IgG from unimmunized rabbits.In confirmation of our previous observation at the cellular level, mice treated with anti idiotype antibodies prior to HBsAg produced a higher mean anti HBs titer when compared to groups of mice receiving pre IgG before HBsAg. It is noteworthy that mice given anti idiotype and peptide 1 had comparable anti HBs titers with mice receiving pre IgG and complete HBsAg 38.6 compared to 34.0 Table 1 These data indicate that anti idiotype in conjunction with peptide 1 can induce anti HBs titers comparable to a single injection of whole HBsAg particles. The results indicate that antiidiotype antibodies can prime the immune system of mice for either a synthetic HBsAg peptide or intact HBsAg particles.

Serum. was obtained on day 30, and the reciprocal of the endpoint dilution which gave an arbitrary positive to negative cpm ratio of 2.1 was determined by radioimmunoassay as previously described. Mean of reciprocal endpoint titer standard error of the mean in the responding animals. In Table 9 the kinetics of the anti HBs response are reported. Only two of six mice produced a detectable anti HBs response when treated with pre IgG prior to the peptide, whereas all seven anti idiotype treated mice generated detectable anti HBs. The anti HBs response peaked at 16 days following antigen exposure in each treatment group of mice. Comparison of the groups of mice given anti idiotype and peptide 1 with pre IgG and HBsAg indicated the anti HBs titer was similar throughout the immune response even though the anti idiotype treated group required 16 days for 100 responsiveness. The reason the mean anti HBs titer was lower at day 6 in the mice given anti idiotype and HBsAg when compared to pre IgG prior to HBsAg is not known 10 as opposed to 26 .However, by day 16 mice injected with antiidiotype antibodies prior to HBsAg had the highest anti HBs response when compared to all other groups. These data are consistent with the fact that anti idiotype antibodies are able to prime the immune system of mice prior to antigenic stimulation. These data further support that anti idiotype antibodies can manipulate the immune response.

The numbers in parentheses are the reciprocal of the mean anti HBs endpoint titer in the responding animals. The theoretical implications for the use of antiID antibodies as vaccines for infectious agents has been previously proposed and discussed elsewhere References 35 . To our knowledge, the only experimental evidence where anti ID can induce protective immunity against an infectious agent has been reported for African trypanosomiasis in mice References 22 23 . A second possibility of anti ID induced immunity appears with HBV. Previous studies have demonstrated that anti HBs is responsible for protection against challenge or reinfection with HBV. The fact that anti HBs can be induced by injection of anti ID alone and this anti HBs expresses an idiotypic determinant that is shared by antiHBs produced in humans naturally infected with HBV suggests the potential for the use of anti ID vaccines for HBV infections.In addition, the anti HBs also recognized the group specific a determinant of HBsAg, which is the epitope that induces protective immunity against HBV. This possibility must await further testing, since only chimpanzees and humans can be infected with human HBV. Alternatively, anti ID could be used in conjunction with HBsAg to potentiate the anti HBs response to a single injection of HBsAg by priming the host s immune system prior to antigenic stimulation. These studies using mice to induce anti HBs by injection of anti ID represent an attempt to understand the humoral immune response to HBsAg via modulation of an ID network.It is not known whether the anti HBs produced in the modulation process described herein resulted from the expression of clones secreting an Ab 3 anti anti ID antibodies which expresses the ID and binds antigen or represents an internal image of HBsAg in which classic antigenic stimulation does not occur. Thus, anti idiotype antibodies are useful for priming the immune response to infectious agents. In the present invention, anti idiotype antibodies prime the immune system of mice prior to stimulation with complete HBsAg. In addition, prior inoculation of the anti idiotype has enabled the synthetic cyclic peptide 122 137 to elicit an anti HBs response comparable to that obtainted with a single injection of whole HBsAg particles. Recently, small peptides have been used to prime the immune system of experimental animals for the later induction of neutralizing antibodies to poliovirus Reference 24 . We have now shown that anti idiotype antibodies may prime the host immune system to potentiate a protective immune response to a weak vaccine, and perhaps it may directly do the same to an infectious agent. This property may be sufficient to protect against infectious agents with long incubation periods and with propensities to set up persistent infections, the most notable of which is type B viral hepatitis. The present invention, therefore, is well adapted to carry out the objects and attain the ends and advantages mentioned as well as others inherent therein. While a presently preferred embodiment of the invention has been given for the purpose of disclosure, numerous changes in compositions and steps of the methods will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art and which are encompassed within the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims.
