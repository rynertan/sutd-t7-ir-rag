# APPARATUS FOR DETECTING PARTICLES AND CHANGES IN PARTICLE SIZE IN A SUSPENSION

## Abstract
An apparatus is disclosed for detecting particles and changes in particle size, for example as a result of floccula tion, in a suspension of particles in a fluid medium. The apparatus comprises means 6 for directing a beam of light at the suspension, a detector 7 for detecting light emerging from the suspension and producing an output signal in response thereto, and means 8 for generating from the output signal of the detector 7 a signal representing the power of the fluctuating component of the said output signal of the detector 7 or a function of that power.
