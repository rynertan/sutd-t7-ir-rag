# Rubber compositions containing ethylene propylene diene terpolymers or ethylene propylene copolymers and silicones.

## Abstract
A rubber made from a blend of EPDM or EPR and a polydiorganosiloxane gum has strength, heat resistance, and adhesiveness to a room temperature, moisture curable silicone rubber. The rubber is made from a blend of EPDM or EPR, polydiorganosiloxane gum, a polyorganosiloxane con taining aliphatic hydrocarbon radicals of 4 to 20 carbon atoms, a polyoxyalkylene organosiloxane copolymer or a poly hydroxyalkyl organosiloxane, and an organic peroxide.
