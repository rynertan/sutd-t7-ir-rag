# High tenacity, fine denier polyvinyl alcohol fiber and a method for production thereof.

## Abstract
A fine denier, high tenacity, water resistant polyvinyl al cohol fiber is produced by dissolving a polyvinyl alcohol having an average degree of polymerization between 1,200 and 3,000, boric acid or a salt thereof in a proportion of 0.5 to 5 weight percent relative to said polyvinyl alcohol and an acid for adjust ing a final spinning solution to pH 5 or less in water to prepare an aqueous solution containing 8 to 14 weight percent of said polyvinyl alcohol, discharging said aqueous solution as said spinning dope from a spinneret nozzle having an average ori fice diameter of 0.02 to 0.04 millimeters into a bath comprising an aqueous solution containing alkali and dehydrating salt at a bath draft within a range of 10 to 60 percent, and finally stretching the resulting tow at least 10 fold. The fine denier fiber thus obtained has a marked reinforcing effect on various materials, particularly inorganic hydraulic materials such as ce ment.
