## Description
High performance papers comprised of fibrils of thermotropic liquid crystalDolymers BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to high performance papers comprised of fibrils of thermotropic liquid crystal polymers. Papers comprised of polymeric materials have been employed for many purposes including filters and electrical insulation, etc. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 2,988,782 3,080,272 and 3,101,294 as well as Glen, W. Papers fromSynthetic Fibers Paper Technology, Vol. 5, No. 2, pages 137 142, 1964. However, such papers are frequently not appropriate for use in a high temperature environment e.g., temperatures in excess of about 2000C. or in an environment where the paper will come into contact with corrosive chemicals or solvents. It is therefore desirable to provide a paper comprised of a polymeric material which is resistant to solvents or corrosive chemicals and suitable for use at high temperatures. It is also known to those skilled in the art that the heat treatment of shaped articles of liquid crystal polymers increases the melting temperature, molecular weight and mechanical properties of the polymer. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,975,487 4,183,895 and 4,247,514. OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a paper which exhibits desirable temperature stability. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a paper which exhibits desirable chemical and solvent resistance. It is also an object. of the present invention to obviate the disadvantages of the prior art discussed above. In accordance with the present invention, there are thus provided papers which exhibit desirable thermal stability and chemical and solvent resistance comprised of fibrils of a polymer which is capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Thermotropic liquid crystal polymers are polymers which are liquid crystalline li.e., anisotropic in the melt phase. These polymers have been described by various terms, including liquid crystalline , liquid crystal and anisotropic . Briefly, the polymers of this class are thought to involve a parallel ordering of the molecular chains. The state wherein the molecules are so ordered is often referred to either as the liquid crystal state or the nematic phase of the liquid crystalline material. These polymers are prepared from monomers which are generally long, flat and fairly rigid along the long axis of the molecule and commonly have chain extending linkages that are either coaxial or parallel. Such polymers readily form liquid crystals i.e., exhibit anisotropic properties in the melt phase. Such properties may be confirmed by conventional polarized light techniques whereby crossed polarizers are utilized. More specifically, the anisotropic melt phase may be confirmed by the use of a Leitz polarizing microscope at a magnification of 40X with the sample on a Leitz hot stage and under nitrogen atmosphere. The polymer is optically anisotropic i.e., it transmits light when examined between crossed. polarizers. Polarized light is transmitted when the sample is optically anisotropic even in the static state. Those thermotropic liquid crystal polymers suitable for use in the present invention include but are not limited to wholly aromatic polyesters, aromatic aliphatic polyesters, aromatic polyazomethines, wholly and non wholly aromatic poly esteramide s and aromatic polyester carbonates. The wholly aromatic thermotropic liquid crystal polymers are comprised of moieties which contribute at least one aromatic ring to the polymer backbone and which enable the polymer to exhibit anisotropic properties in the melt phase.Such moieties include but are not limited to aromatic diols, aromatic amines, aromatic diacids and aromatic hydroxy acids.Moieties which may be present in the thermotropic liquid crystal polymers employed in the present invention include but are not limited to the following EMI4.1 Preferably, the thermotropic liquid crystal polymers which are employed comprise not less than about 10 mole percent of recurring units which include a naphthalene moiety. Preferred naphthalene moieties include 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl 2,6 dioxynaphtha lene, and 2,6 dicarboxynaphthalene. Specific examples of suitable aromatic aliphatic polyesters are copolymers of polyethylene terephthalate and hydroxybenzoic acid as disclosed in Polyester X7G A Self ReinforcedThermoplastic, by W.J.

Wholly aromatic polymers which are preferred for use in the present invention include wholly aromatic polyesters and poly ester amide s which are disclosed in commonly assigned U.S.Patent Nos. 4,067,852 4,083,829 4,130,545 4,161,470 4,184,296 4,219,461 4,238,599 4,224,433 4,256,624 and 4,279,803 and in commonly assigned U.S. Application Serial Nos. 91,003, filedNovember 5, 1979 128,759, filed March 10, 1980 and 214,557, filed December 9,1980. The disclosures of all of the aboveidentified commonly assigned U.S. patents and applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. The wholly aromatic polymers disclosed therein typically are capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase at a temperature below approximately 400.or., and preferably below approximately 35QpC. The wholly aromatic polymers including wholly aromatic polyesters and poly ester amide s which are suitable for use in the present invention may be formed by a variety of ester orming techniques whereby organic monomer compounds possessing functional groups which, upon condensation, form the requisite recurring moieties are reacted. For instance, the functional groups of the organic monomer compounds may be carboxylic acid groups, hydroxyl groups, ester groups, acyloxy groups, acid halides, amine groups, etc. The organic monomer compounds may be reacted in the absence of a heat exchange fluid via a melt acidolysis procedure. They, accordingly, may be heated initially to form a melt solution of the reactants with the reaction continuing as said polymer particles are suspended therein.A vacuum may be applied to facilitate removal of volatiles formed during the final stage of the condensation e.g., acetic acid or water . Commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 4,083,829, entitled Melt Processable Thermotropic Wholly Aromatic Polyester, describes a slurry polymerization process which may be employed to form the wholly aromatic polyesters which are preferred for use in the present invention. According to such a process, the solid product is suspended in a heat exchange medium. The dis closure of this patent has previously been incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. , When employing either the melt acidolysis procedure or the slurry procedure of U.S. Patent No. 4,083,829, the organic monomer reactants from which the wholly aromatic polyesters are derived may be initially provided in a modified form whereby the usual hydroxy groups of such monomers are esterified i.e., they . . . . are provided as lower acyl esters . The lower acyl groups pre ferably have from about two to about four carbon atoms. Pre ferably, the acetate esters of organic monomer reactants are provided. Representative catalysts which optionally may be employed in either the melt acidolysis procedure or in the slurry procedure of U.S. Patent No. 4,083,829 include dialkyl tin oxide e.g., dibutyl tin oxide , diaryl tin oxide, titanium dioxide, antimony trioxide, alkoxy titanium silicates, titanium alkoxides, alkali and alkaline earth metal salts of carboxylic acids e.g., zinc acetate , the gaseous acid catalysts such as Lewis acids e.g., BF3 , hydrogen halides e.g,, At1 , etc. The quantity of catalyst utilized typically is about 0.001 to I percent by weight based upon the total monomer weight, and most commonly about 0.01 to 0.2 percent by weight. The wholly aromatic polymers suitable for use in the present invention tend to be substantially insoluble in common solvents and accordingly are not susceptible to solution process ing. As discussed previously, they can be readily processed by common melt processing techniques. Most suitable wholly aromatic polymers are soluble in pentafluorophenol. The wholly aromatic polyesters which are preferred for use in the present invention commonly exhibit a weight average molecular weight of about 2,000 to 200,000, and preferably about 10,000 to 50,000, and most preferably about 20,000 to 25,000. The wholly aromatic poly ester amide s which are preferred com monly exhibit a molecular weight of about 5000 to 50,000 and preferably about 10,000 to 30,000 e.g., 15,000 to 17,000. Such molecular weight may be determined by gel permeation chromato graphy as well as by other standard techniques not involving the solutionlng of the polymer, e.g., by end group determination via infrared spectroscopy on compression molded films. Alterna tively, light scattering techniques in a pentafluorophenol solu tion may be employed to determine the molecular weight. The wholly aromatic polyesters and poly ester amide s additionally commonly exhibit an inherent viscosity i.e., i.V. of at least approximately 2.0 dl. g., e.g., approximately 2.0 to 10.0 dl. g., when dissolved in a concentration of 0.1 percent by weight in pentafluorophenol at 600C.

The preferred dicarboxy aryl moiety II is EMI17.1 i o 6 the preferred moiety III is EMI17.2 and the preferred dioxy aryl moiety IV is EMI17.3 The papers of the present invention are comprised of fibrils of thermotropic liquid crystal polymers i.e., polymers which are capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase . The fibrils may be produced by several methods including mechanically masticating shaped articles including as spun thermotropic liquid crystal polymer fibers. Since the as spun fibers are highly oriented along their longitudinal axis, the fibers are able to withstand much less stress along the transverse axis as opposed to along the longitudinal axis.Accordingly, the fibers readily break up length wise into much narrower fibrils as they are masticated to form a pulp. The fibers are preferably masticated in the form of an aqueous slurry. The pulp which is formed is a mass of fibrils which are generally frayed, fibrillated and or branched. Such characteris tics permit the fibrils to become intertangled such that a thin, yet coherent mat may be formed upon simple screening of the slurry. The term pulp is intended to refer to a mass of fibers or other shaped articles which have been mechanically masticated or ground, causing the fiber or article to separate, split, fray, fibrillate and or shred into generally finer diameter units. The intertangling between the units, or interfelting , is thereby enhanced, thus allowing the formation of thin, yet coherent sheets. The fibers and fragments may, in addition, become crimped, branched, or multiply bifurcated to improve the interfelting. A typical solids content of the pulp ranges from about 0.5 to 50 grams of polymer per liter of liquid te.g., water , i.e., from about 0.05 to 5 percent by weight of solids. A pre ferred solids content ranges from about 0.5 to 2 percent by weight of solids. When a wet laid paper mat is produced it is advantageous to cast the paper from a slightly more dilute slurry e.g., from about 0.01 to 1 percent by weight of solids . The term masticating as used herein is intended to include various mechanical processes whereby the shaped article is subjected to grinding or shearing forces of sufficient magnitude to break up the shaped article into fibrils. The mastication step may involve a series of techniques rather than a single operation. Such processes include but are not limited to the use of fluid or air turbulence i.e., air fibrillation , use of high shear i.e., as in a pulp refiner and open disk emulsifier , repeated chopping in conjunction with fluid shear te.g., as in aWaring blender , and crushing in conjunction with mechanical shear. e.g., as in a Jordan beater The use of surface wetting agents or 50 percent isopropanol or ethanol may facilitate the fibrillation of the polymer. The fibrils which are produced commonly exhibit a ratio of length to diameter which is generally greater than that exhibited by the fibers. For example, the length to diameter ratio exhibited by the fibers generally ranges from about 30 1 to about 300 1, while the corresponding ratio for the fibrils ranges from about 50 1 to about 600 1. The fibrils preferably exhibit a diameter of about 0.5 to about 5 microns and a length of about 50 microns to about 3 millimeters. The fibers which are masticated are generally from 1 32 to 1 4 inch in length and 14 to 35 microns in diameter. The denier of the fiber is preferably from about 2 to 10 Fibers of a much broader size can also be employed, such as, for example, 0.5 to 100 denier 7 to 100 microns in diameter . A typical starting length ranges from 1 32 to 1 4 inch. If a starting length of greater than 1 8 inch is employed, the pulping method employed should be capable of length reduction as well as fibril lation to avoid clumping of the pulp particles. The length of the fibrils which are produced will generally be proportional to the length of the fibers employed. As noted in copending application Serial No. of John R. Kastelic, Larry F. Charbonneau and Thomas P. Carter, Jr. entitled Thermotropic Liquid Crystal Polymer Pulp and Method of Production Thereof Wherein Said Polymer Comprises RecurringUnits Which Contain A 2,6 Dioxyanthraquinone Moiety filed , , itit has been found that the presence of at least about 5 mole percent of recurring units which contain a 2,6 dioxyanthraquinone moiety in the thermotropic liquid crystal polymer enables the fibers to be readily broken up into fibrils of submicron size while minimizing the use of time and energy with respect to the fibrillation process. While the use of the fibers is preferred, it is also possible to use articles of other shapes and configurations. For example, the polymer may also be in the form of pellets or sheets, etc. The term shaped article as used herein is intended to include particles, pellets, filaments, staple fibers, films, chips, sheets and other extruded, molded, cast or otherwise formed shaped articles. It should be noted, however, that the more highly oriented is the polymer in the article, the higher the aspect ratio of the fibrils which are formed will be. It is therefore preferable to employ articles in the method of the present invention which are highly oriented as a result of being formed e.g., melt spun fibers in order to produce fibrils having a high aspect ratio. The fibrils which are produced can subsequently be slurried with a liquid which is a non solvent for the polymer of which the fibrils are comprised such as water and collected e.g., filtered onto a web or screen to provide a random i.e., multi dimensional array or sheet of fibrils. In addition to wet laying, webs may be formed by air lay processes wherein the fibrous material is entrained in and deposited from a moving air stream. Since the fibrils which are produced are generally bifurcated or branched along the longitudinal axis, they tend to become attached to one another as they are deposited. Appropriate methods are employed to bond the fibrils together to form a paper having the desired degree of. structural integrity. That is, the paper at a minimum supports its own weight and preferably is pulled apart only with difficulty. Such a paper will accordingly be in the form of a sheet or web. The fibrils may be thermally bonded to one another at a suitable temperature by conventional means such as heat pressing or calendering to at least bond the fibrils together at their crossover points. Such fusion bonding does not result in any significant loss of orientation and, accordingly, loss of strength since the polymer of which the fibrils are comprised forms an anisotropic melt phase.Such a characteristic is in direct contrast to conventional thermoplastic polymers which do not form an anisotropic melt phase and which readily lose their orientation upon being heated to temperatures in excess of their melting temperature. Heat pressing is essentially a batch process wherein the web of fibrils is pressed between two heated plates.Calendering involves the passage of the fibrils in the form of a web between heated rolls. The use of a padded backup roll against a heated metal roll is preferred. The thermal bonding temperature will generally range from about 100 to about 2500C. The fibrils may also be bonded together by means of adhesives including but not limited to the following epoxies, thermosetting or thermoplastic resins including thermosetting polyesters, water soluble adhesives such as casine, guar gum or polyacrylic acid, solvent based adhesives and emulsion or latex based adhesives such as styrene butyl acrylic copolymer sys tems. The adhesive may be coated onto the web or array of fi brils by use of kiss rolls. Alternatively, the adhesive may be sprayed upon or deposited upon the web by known emulsion techni ques for use with wet laid paper . The use of adhesives in such methods is known and will not be discussed in greater detail herein. The temperature as well as the method of thermal bond ing employed affects the physical characteristics exhibited by the paper which is produced. For example, when temperatures below about 140 C. are used, an opaque paper is provided. Such. papers are essentially a mat of inter tangled fibrous particulates the fibrils which exhibits substantial porosity and low density. On the other hand, when temperatures in excess of about 1400C. are employed in conjunction with a pressing or calendering step and especially in the range of 1700C. or so . a transparent paper in the form of a film or membrane resembling a glassine film is produced which exhibits reduced porosity. Accordingly, the use of excessive temperatures and pressures should generally be avoided during calendering if a paper of substantial porosity is desired since such temperatures and pressures increase the degree of fusion and compactior the fibrils to each other while correspondingly decreasing the porosity.The amount of pressure applied as well as the duration of the application of pressure can also influence the degree of fusion. The papers of the present invention possess many advan tageous properties due to the presence of thermotropic liquid crystal polymers therein. Since the liquid crystal polymers are highly oriented as spun, the fibrils which comprise the papers of the present invention possess relatively high tensile strength and high modulus, Accordingly, papers comprised of such fibrils similarly exhibit relatively high modulus and high tensile strength. In a dition, the papers exhibit such tensile strength and modulus in a multi dimensional manner due to the multi dimensional i.e., random orientation of the fibrils within the paper. The papers can vary in weight, porosity, thickness, etc. depending upon the amount of fibrils employed, the pressure used to thermally bond the fibrils together, etc. The papers typi calls, however, can exhibit a weight ranging from 3 to 20 ounces sq uare yard. The mechanical properties of the papers produced in accordance with the present invention can be improved still further by subjecting the papers to a heat treatment following formation thereof. The heat treatment improves the properties of the paper by increasing the molecular weight of the liquid crystalline polymer which comprises the fibrils and increasing the degree of crystallinity thereof while also increasing the melting temperature of the polymer. Such heat treatment can also serve to bond the fibrils together. The papers may be thermally treated in an inert atmos phere e.g., nitrogen, carbon dioxide, argon, helium or alterna tively, in a flowing oxygen containing atmosphere e.g., air . The use of a non oxidizing substantially moisture free atmosphere is preferred to avoid the possibility of thermal degradation. For instance, the paper may be brought to a temperature approxi mately 10 to 30 centigrade degrees below the melting temperature of the liquid crystal polymer, at which temperature the fibrils remain solid. It is preferable for the temperature of the heat treatment to be as high as possible without equaling or exceeding the melting temperature of the polymer. It is most preferable to gradually increase the temperature. of heat treatment in accordance with the increase of the melting temperature of the polymer during heat treatment. The duration of the heat treatment will commonly range from a few minutes to a number of days, e.g., from 0.5 to 200 hours, or more. Preferably, the heat treatment is conducted for a time of 1 to 48 hours and typically from about 5 to 30 hours. Generally, the duration of heat treatment varies depending upon the heat treatment temperature that is, a shorter treatment time is required as a higher treatment is used. Thus, the duration of the heat treatment can be shortened for higher melting polymers, since higher heat treatment temperatures can be applied without melting the polymer. Preferably, the heat treatment is conducted under con ditions sufficient to increase the melting temperature of the polymer at least 10 centigrade degrees. Most preferably, the melting temperature of the liquid crystal polymer is increased from between about 20 to about 50 centigrade degrees as a result of the heat treatment. The amount of increase which is obtained is dependent upon the temperature used in the heat treatment, with higher heat treatment temperatures giving greater increases. Similar advantages can also be obtained by heat treating the fibrils prior to their incorporation into a paper. It is, however, preferable to heat treat the paper subsequent to its formation since the thermal bonding and heat treatment steps can then be combined. It should be noted at this point that reference herein to a temperature below which a specific polymer may exhibit anisotropic properties in the melt phase is intended to refer to the temperature below which the polymer exhibits such properties prior to heat treatment thereof. The chemical resistance of the liquid crystal polymer also increases with the heat treatment and the solubility in pentafluorophenol, one of the rare solvents for thermotropic liquid crystal polymers, continuously decreases with increasing heat treatment time such that eventually the polymer does not dissolve even minimally such as in amounts of 0.1 percent by weight . The physical characteristics of the paper may be varied by the addition of various additives to the pulp in the web formation process. For example, wetting agents, surface treatment agents, coloring agents and fillers can be added. Such additives can also include reinforcing fibers of various materials including thermotropic liquid crystal polymeric fibers, glass fibers, microglass fibers, wood pulp, cotton and other cellulosic fibers, asbestos, mineral fibers, ceramic fibers, metallic fibers such as steel fibers, carbon fibers and synthetic non liquid crystalline fibers such as viscous rayon, polyester, polyolefin, nylon and polytetrafluoroethylene. Such fibers can be incorporated over a wide range of proportions to provide products having the desired characteristics.Exemplary proportions generally are less than D percent by weight such that at least about 50 percent by wight of the paper is comprised of fibrils of thermotropic liquid crystal polymers. Preferably, the paper consists essentially of fibrils of a thermotropic liquid crystal polymer in order to maximize the advantageous effect of such polymers. Dimensions of common reinforcing fibers range from I micron to 50 microns in diameter and from 1 32 to several inches in length, depending on the type of tiber and the physical characteristics desired in the paper product. The invention is additionally illustrated in connection with the following Example which is to be considered as illustrative of the present invention. it should understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the specific details of. theExample. EXAMPLE Twenty grams of a fiber comprised of a thermotropic liquid crystal polymer consisting of 40 mole percent of a poxybenzoyl moiety and 60 mole percent of a 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl moiety are cut into lengths ranging from about 1 8 to 1 4 inch.The cut fibers are admixed with three quarts of water and subjected to grinding in a Waring blender for about one hour to provide a coarse pulp comprised of fibrils. The coarse pulp in slurry form is further ground in aRoss and Sons mixer emulsifier at the highest speed possible to provide a finer pulp. The fibrils in the finer pulp generally exhibit a length 1 2 to 1 4 of the length of the as cut fibers and a diameter 1 2 to 1 5 that of the as cut fibers. Grinding occurs in batches containing about 2 grams each of the coarse pulp. Each batch is further diluted with water and formed into a single sheet using a standard hand sheet mold equipped with a plastic screen. Each of the sheets are dried and calendered at a temperature between about 100 and 1i0 C. to produce paper sheets of increasing density and strength as the calendering temperature increases. The above procedure is repeated except that heat treated chopped fibers of a thermotropic liquid crystal polymer consisting of 40 mole percent of p oxybenzoyl moieties and 60 mole percent o f 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl moieties are added to a batch of fine ground pulp in an amount of 25 percent by weight prior to the sheet forming step. The fibers are heat treated by heating the fibers to a temperature of about 275 C. over a period of about 16 hours and maintaining the fibers at about 2750C. for several hours. The sheet formed therefrom is calendered at temperatures similar to those employed before to produce sheets of improved strength in comparison to the non reinforced sheets. Certain of the papers produced according to the above method are analyzed to determine their physical characteristics with the results tabulated below TABLE I Physical Properties of Papers of The Present Invention Volume Calendering Resistivity Mullen InstronPaper Temperature Weight2 100 v.
