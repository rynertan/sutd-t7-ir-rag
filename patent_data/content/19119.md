# Method of forming a short channel field effect transistor and field effect transistor made by that method.

## Abstract
A field effect transistor FET with a very small effective channel length is made by using a first ion implantation to produce the source 18 and drain 19 regions of the FET and a second very shallow ion implantation 22 next to the source region 18 to produce the effective short channel of the FET. The effective channel of the FET is implanted to only a small fraction of the depth of the source and drain. This permits superior control over the threshold voltage of the FET and increases the operating speed of the FET.
