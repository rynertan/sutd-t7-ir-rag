## Description
KZTHDD YOR PRODUCINO A METALLIC OXIDE COATING ON A SURFACE OF A GLASS SUBSIRhIS DESCRIPTION This invention is directed to a method for obtaining a preferred composition for a multi component metallic oxide coating on a surface of a glass substrate. It is already known to coat glass substrates by applying dry powder mixtures of organic based metallic salts to the surface of a glass ribbon either directly or in a vaporised form. For example U.S. Patent 3,081,200 indicates in column 3, at line 13, that powders of organic based metallic salts can be sprayed against the surface of heated glass substrates, but no particular data is given and the patent contains no discussion of the types of compositions generated on the surface of the glans substrate. German patent publication No. 2,529,076 teaches charging of metallic salt particles prior to their application to a glass surface. The glass is preheated to a temperature in the range from 5000C to 6500C and the organic based metallic salts are applied to the glass surface. The carrier gas for entraining the salt particles may be preheated. German patent publication lo. 2529077 shows a delivery system in which organic based metallic salts are used in pyrolytic glass coating techniques. However in this case, the finer salt particles are carried to the surface of glass, whereas the larger salt particles are held back. These larger salt particles are partly vaporised and then mixed with the fine salt particles being carried to the surface of the glass sheet. German Patent Publication No. 2529079 teaches an apparatus in which a cyclone is used to drop large salt particles on a glass surface to be pyrolytically coated. None of these three GermanPatent publications discuss the chemistry of the coating developed on The glass surface being treated. U.S. Patent 3,852,098 is directed to a method for increasing the rate of coating a surface of a glass substrate by using vaporised reactants. In this case, the glass substrate is coated with a metal containing coating by heating the glass and thereafter contacting the hot glass with a gaseous mixture. The gaseous mixture is from 40g to 100fi saturated with the vapors of a reactive metal compound. The gaseous mixture is heated by the glass to a sufficient temperature to cause the metal compound to react, thereby depositing the coating on the glass substrate. U.S. Patent 4,182,783 is directed to a method of vapour deposition of a coating on a glass substrate. In this method, particulate solid coating reactants are fluidised and vapourised by first establishing a fluidised bed of dispersed particulant solid coating reactants and thereafter drawing a volume of fluidised gas and suspended particulate solid coating reactants to a vapouriser. The vapouriser vapourises the dispersed particulant solid coating reactants in the reactant gas mixture. The reactant gas mixture is then directed into contact with a hot glass substrate to be coated in order to deposit a film thereon. This patent does not undertake a discussion of the chemistry of the compositions develpped on the surface of a glass substrate. U.S. Patent 4,188,199 is directed to a process for forming a metal compound coating on a moving glass ribbon. The method comprises the steps of contacting the glass ribbon while at an elevated temperature with a fluid medium containing the reactant chemicals which undergo chemical reaction to form the metal compound on the glass ribbon. Portions of the fluid medium are discharged against the glass ribbon in stream formations which have a velocity component in the direction of movement of the glass ribbon and a velocity component which is inclined to the surface of the glass ribbon so that a selected angle is formed between the spray and the glass ribbon. This patent does not undertake any discussion of the relationship between the composition of the coating generated on the surface of the glass ribbon and the particular conditions under which that coating is applied. U.S. Patent 4,230,271 is directed to an apparatus for evenly and uniformly depositing particulates suspended in a gas on at least one surface of a glass substrate. The device is designed to provide a uniform application of material on a substrate. Once again this patent does not undertake a discussion of the relationship between the coating composition gent rated on a glass substrate and the particular conditions under which the coating was applied. The present invention is based upon the discovery that if a non homogeneous, multi component, dry powder mixture of heatdecomposable metallic salts is applied by pyrolytic techniques to the surface of a glass substrate, the composition developed on the surface of a glass ribbon depends not only upon the composition sprayed but also upon the spraying conditions. A non homogeneous metallic salt mixture means a mixture in which the individual particles of the mixture are primarily formed on only one of the components of the multi component mixture. Such non homogeneous mixtures may be formed by a simple dry powder mixing operation or a ball milling operation carried out for a short time period.A homo6eneous mixture would be one in which the individual particles of the mixture contain all of the components of the multi component mixture. A homogeneous mixture may be formed in a spray drying operation. It is much cheaper to use a non homogeneous mixture for spray coating the surface of a glass ribbon. Dy multi component mixtures is meant a mixture containing two or more components. Thus, a single non homogeneous spray composition can and does generate a myriad of different compositions on the surface of the glass ribbon depending upon the particular spraying conditions under which the non homogeneous spray composition was applied. So long as the spray conditions are held uniform, a uniform composition is developed on the surface of the glass ribbon. However, if there is a change in the spray conditions, for example, the angle of the spray with respect to the glass or the distance from the spray gn to the surface of the glass, the composition generated on the surface of the glass will change. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for producing a metallic oxide coating on a surface of a glass substrate which comprises spraying a multi component non homogeneous dry powder mixture of heat decomposable metallic salts on to the surface of the substrate and heating the surface of the substrate to a temperature sufficient to decompose tha said metallic salts characterised in that the composition of the dry powder mixture and or the spraying conditions are selected with reference to the results of a test procedure in which the compositions of the coatings formed on a plurality of test specimens of the glass substrate are determined and compared with a desired composition for the coating, the test specimens being prepared using different spraying conditions or dry powder mixtures of different compositions. The coating technique preferably involves spraying the dry powder mixture against the surface of the glass substrate while the surface is at a temperature in the range of from 7000F 3700C to 12000F 6so0c . In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a plurality of test samples of a non homogeneous, dry powder mixture are formed. Each sample has a different composition of the multicomponent metallic salts. Individual glass substrates are sprayed under identical conditions with the individual test samples of the dry powder mixture. In this manner there is formed a plurality of coated test speciments. Each coated test speciment will be sprayed under identical conditions but with a different starting non homogeneous, dry powder mixtures and thereby will have on its surface a different composition of a multi component metallic oxide coating. Each of the coated test specimenta is analysed to determine the chemical composition of the coating thereon. thereafter, a determination is made as to which coated test specimen has a coating thereon of the preferred composition, that is, a coating composition of multi component metallic oxide which exhibits the best chemical and physical durability for that multi component system. After the determination has been made, commercial quantities of glass are sprayed under the same operating conditions used to spray the test specimens. The commercial spraying is carriedout using the non homogeneous, dry powder mixture having the composition which produced the preferred composition on the coated test specimen As an alternative embodiment of this method, a single, non homogeneous, dry powder mixture may be prepared having a selected composition of the multi corponent, metallic salts therein. This single composition is sprayed under a plurality of different conditions. For example, spray gun height and spray gun angle are changed while the selected composition is sprayed onto a plurality of glass substrates in order to form a plurality of coated teat specimens.Each of the coated test specimens will have a different composition of metallic oxiae coating thereon because the spraying condition for each coating operation was different although the sprayed composition was the same. Once again, each of the coated test specimens is analysed to determine the chemical composition of the coating thereon and a determination is made as to which test specimen has the preferred coating composition thereon. Once this determination has been made, then commercial quantities of glass are sprayed under operating conditions which produced the preferred composition on the coated test specimen. The powder composition used for spraying is the selected composition used in spraying all of the glass substrates in order to produce the test specimens, but the spraying conditions used are those which produce the test specimen having the preferred composition coating thereon. Two embodiments of the invention will now be described in greater detail by way of example only. The methods disclosed herein may be successfully utilised with materials yet to be developed by skilled artisans, such as new, non homogeneous, organic based metallic salts which are heat decomposable. It is therefore contemplated that the method disclosed in this specification may also be successfully used with materials yet to be developed because the principles of operation of the method remain the same, regardless of the particular materials subjected to the method or used with the method. Before discussing the preferred embodiment of the method of the invention, reference is made to U.S. Patent 4,217,392, which claimed a coated glass article. In that patent it was indicated that certain improved chemical and physical properties may be achieved in a multi component metallic oxide coating on a glass substrate if the proportion of the elements making up the coating fell within a particular relationship disclosed in that patent.The spray system involved was one which generated a coating on the glass substrate containing chromium oxide, cobalt oxide and iron oxide. That particular patent dealt with the development of such a coating composition from 2 process in which the organic compounds of the desired metallic materials were dissolved in an organic solvent and a solution spray was applied to the glass substrate. Using dry spray ingredients, as taught in this specification, there is still some preferred relationships between the three mentioned metallic oxide materials in the coating composition, but there is a slight shift in the preferred compositions when dry, non homogeneous, powder mixtures of metallic salts are used. For example, a greater amount of chromium oxide may be present in the preferred coating film, somewhere upwards of l . The reason for this is not fully understood. As discussed in the mentioned patent 4,217,392, chemical and physical durabilities are measured by two separate tests.Chemical durability is measured by a first procedure in which a coated sample is subjected to a five hour hydrochloric acid vapour test. In this case, hydrochloric acid vapours surrounded the material and attempt to attack the coating on the glass. An attack of the coating changes the level of transmission of visual wavelength energy through the glass. There is a greater amount of energy transmitted as the durability of the film is attacked.The change in transmission characteristics of the coated glass to the transmission of energy therethrough is consiaered acceptable if it is in a range of 15g or less, any greater change of the film being considered unacceptable. The second test is a test of physical durability. In this test the sample is initially heat tempered. Thereafter, the tempered test sample is subjected to a humidity test in which the sample is subjected to a 1 4 humidity at 1200F 660C for a period of six weeks. The high humidity can cause the coating on the surface to loosen its adherence to the surface and come free.The measurement of durability is that the surface coating stays in place for the prolonged period of time and no less than 1 of the coating is removed therefrom. If any greater amount of material is removed, the sample is rejected as failed.First Embodiment A first embodiment of the method of the invention is carried out as follows. A preferred composition for a multicomponent metallic oxide coating for a surface of a glass substrate is selected. A coating composition consisting of 9. 5 chromium oxide 1q iron oxide, with the balance cobalt oxide has excellent chemical and physical durability characteristics as it passes both the acid test and the humidity tests set forth above.Therefore, in this first embodiment that composition was selected as being the preferred coating composition. The next step is to form a plurality of test samples of a dry, non homogeneous, powder mixture which is to be used in the pyrolytic coating technique. Teach sample has a different composition of the multi component organic based metallic salts. In accordance with this preferred teaching, four dry powder mixtures were formed. The four mixtures are as follows, each being based on the weight of a particular organic based metallic salt present.In each case the metallic salt is an acetyl acetate salt. Mixture 80g cobalt, 10 iron and 10 chromium Mixture 2 7t351o cobalt, 10 iron and 12 chromium Mixture 3 76 cobalt, 12 iron and 12 chromium and Mixture 4 74 cobalt, l iron and 1296 chromium. Each of the mixtures 1 4 were sprayed under identical conditions against individual test speciments of a glass substrate.The tbst conditions were that the gun was located at an angle of 450 with respect to the surface of the test specimen and that The distance from the gun to the substrate was 9.5 inches 21.5cm .In this manner, four different test specimens were formed and each specimen had a different coating composition of metallic oxide coating thereon. Each of the coated test specimens was analysed to determine the chemical composition of the coating thereon. It was found that the coated test specimen coated by Mixture No. 3 had a coating composition thereon of l iron oxide, 9.5 chromium oxide, with the balance being cobalt oxide, the preferred CxmpOsitiOn desired. Thus, the third mixture produced the sample having the desired composition which will pass the acid test and the humidity test mentioned above. After this determination was made, commercial quantities of glass were sprayed under the same spraying comditions used to spray the test samples, that is, the 45 angle and 9.5 inches spacing. The mixture No. 3 was used in the commercial operating process so that the resulting glass had developed thereon a coating composition of the preferred composition. Second Embodiment In the second embodiment of the method of the invention, a single, non homogeneous, powder composition was used for spraying four different test specimens, but different angles and distances between the test speciments to be sprayed and the spraying nozzle were used. The different conditions for the spray operation resulted in the production of different coating film compositions.In this situation, the non homogeneous spray mixture used was that of Mixture No. 3 from the first embodiment of the method.In this second testing procedure, Test 1 was at an angle of 600 with a spacing of 13 inches Test 2 at an angle of 45 with 13 inches spacing Test 3 at a 600 angle with a 9.5 inches distance, 0 and Test 4 at a 45 angle with a 9.5 inch spacing. Thus, the four test specimens were generated using a single spraying composition but different spraying conditions. Example 1 produced a film composition which was characterised in that it contained 36.6 oxide, 9.6 chrome oxide, with the balance being cobalt oxide. Test No. 2 produced a film composition characterised in that it contained 30. fi iron oxide, 10. chrome oxide, with the balance being cobalt oxide. Test No.3 produced a film composition characterised in that it contained 36.8 iron oxide, 10.0 chrome oxide, with the balance being cobalt oxide. Test No. 4 produced the desired preferred film composition of 1Q iron oxide, 9.5 chromium, with the balance being cobalt oxide. This film composition passes the acid test and the humidity test set forth above. Following the test procedure, commercial quantities of glass there sprayed under the conditions of Test No. 4 to produce a glass having the desired coating thereon.
