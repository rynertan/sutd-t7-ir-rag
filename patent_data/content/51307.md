## Description
CONTROL FOR AN AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a control method and system for an air conditioning system for automotive vehicles, and more particularly to a method and system in which an air conditioner outlet duct air temperature is controlled in accordance with the temperatures at various locations of the automotive vehicle. 2. Description of the Prior Art In recent years, automotive vehicles are equipped with an air conditioning system by which the air within the passenger compartment is conditioned at a desired temperature value. In air conditioning systems, air is introduced through an air intake via a blower fan, and the introduced air is cooled at a cooling unit. A part of the cooled air is then heated by a heater unit, and mixed with the other part of the cooled air by means of an air mix door. In order to maintain the temperature within the passenger compartment at an appropriate preset value, the opening degree of the air mix door is so adjusted, by a control circuit that an outlet duct air of a desired temperature is obtained. Furthermore, the control circuit includes a bridge circuit comprising thermistors for sensing the temperatures at various location of the vehicle, such as the outside air temperature, passenger compartment temperature, and the output signal of the bridge circuit is used for adjusting the air mix door position. In such a prior art air conditioning system, however, the control of the outlet duct air temperature is greately dependent on the temperature resistance characteristic of the the thermistors used in the bridge circuit. And therefore, a desired output signal characteristic of the bridge circuit is obtained only by adjusting the resistance value of a variable resistor connected in series or in parallel with the thermistors in the bridge circuit. Accordingly, it is very difficult to maintain the passenger compartment air temperature accurately at a preset value, especially when the thermal load applied to the vehicle, such as the outside air temperatuer, has changed very much. A more detailed description of the prior art air conditioning system is made hereinafter with reference to the attached drawings under DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THEPREFERRED EMBODIMENTS.

In Fig. 1, air is introduced inside the air conditioning system through an air inlet duct 3 by a blower fan 2 driven by a motor 1. The introduced air is then cooled by a cooling unit 4. After that, a part of the cooled air is heated by a heater unit 6 and then mixed with the other unheated part of cooled air by means of an air mix door 5. The so obtained mixed air is finally discharged outside of the air conditioning system from a plurality of outlet ducts 7, 8 and 9 into a passenger compartment. The reference numerarl 10 indicates a compressor, the numeral 11 indicates an actuator for positioning the air mix door 5, the numeral 12 indicates a sensor for sensing the position on opening degree of the air mix door 5, the numeral 13 indicates a slide switch operatively cooperating with the air mix door 5, the numerals 14 and 15 indicate solenoid valves to activate the actuator 11, namely the numeral 14 indicates a solenoid valve to introduce a vacuum pressure from a source of vacuum, for example an engine intake manifold, into the actuator 11 for driving the air mix door 5 in one direction, and the numeral 15 indicates a solenoid valve to reduce the vacuum in the actuator 11 to the atmospheric pressure for driving the air mix door 5 in the opposite direction. The amount of air to be introduced into the air conditioning system via the blower fan 2 is controlled by means of an air intake door 16. When the air intake door 16 is located at a position shown by the solid line inFig. 1, only outside air is introduced into the air conditioning system as shown by the arrow A, which is called outside air introduction mode . On the other hand, when the air intake door 16 is located at a position shown by the dashed lines in Fig. 1, only air within the passenger compartment is introduced into the air conditioning system as shown by the arrow B, which is called inside air recirculation mode .The air within the passenger compartment is refreshed with the outside air when the outside air introduction mode is selected, and the air recirculated within the passenger compartment is efficiently cooled or heated when the inside air recirculation mode is selected. Reference is now made to Fig. 2, in which a prior art control circuit for an air conditioning system, such as the system shown in Fig. 1, is diagramatically illustrated. In Fig. 2, the control circuit includes a bridge circuit which comprises a first set of series connected resistors including a pair of thermistors, namely, a passenger compartment temperature sensor Rp, and an outside air temperature sensor Ras and a fisrt fixed resistor R1, and a second set of series connected resistors including a fixed resistor R2, a potentiometer VR5 for presetting the passenger compartment air temperature, a potentiometer transducer VRm for sensing an air mix door openging degree, and a fixed resistor Rh. A junction C between the resistors R1 and Rp and a junction E between the resisters R2 and Rh are connected to input terminals of a comparator 20 whose output is connected to a solenoid valve actuation circuit 22 for the solenoid valve 14. On the other hand, a junction D between the resistors R and Rp, and a junction F between the resistors Rh and R5 are connected to input terminals of a comparator 21 whose output is connected to a solenoid valve actuation circuit 23 for the solenoid valve 15. When the potential level at the junction C becomes higher than the potential level at the junction E, the solenoid valve 14 is actuated by the solenoid valve actuation circuit 22, so that the vaccum pressure is introduced into the actuator 11 for driving the air mix door 5 in one direction. Conversely, when the potential level at the junction D becomes lower than the potential level at the junciton F, the solenoid valve 15 is actuated by the solenoid valve actuation circuit 23, so that the vacuum in the actuator 11 is reduced for driving the air mix door 5 in the opposite direction. The opening degree of the air mix door 5 is thus controlled by means of the actuator 11 in accordance with the output signal of the control circuit which is responsive to the change in the output potential level of the bridge circuit provided.Therein, resistor Rh is used for providing a hystersis characteristic between the operations of the solenoids 14 and 15. In order to facilitate the more precise understanding of the temperature control operation of the above control circuit, the operation of the air conditioning system is discussed from a view point of the heat equilibrium with reference to Figs. 3 a to 3 c and 4. Reference is first made to Fig. 3 a which shows a heat equilibrium characteristic curve T within the passenger compartment, against fixed outlet duct air temperatures. In other wo.rds, Fig. 3 a shows the stable points of the passenger compartment air temperature corresponding to various values of the outlet duct air temperature of the air conditioning system. As shown in Fig. 3 a when the outlet duct air temperature is low, the passenger compartment air temperature is settled low and when the outlet duct air temperature is high, the passenger compartment air temperature is settled high. The above tendency is unchanged even if the heat supplied by the air conditioning system is absorbed by the thermal load applied to the passenger compartment heat supplied from solar ray, outside air, ventilated air, a passenger, and an equipment such as an engine, and so on . Turning to Fig. 3 b , there is shown a temperature control characteristics of the air conditioning system along which the temperature at the outlet duct air is controlled. As shown, the temperature control characteristics is such that when the passenger compartment air temperature is high, the outlet duct air temperature is controlled at a low level, and when the passenger compartment air temperature is low, the outlet duct air temperature is controlled at a high level. In addition, it is known that the outlet duct air temperature level is controlled, in all season, within a range shown by dashed lines in the figure regardless of change in the outside air temperature. Nextly, the heat equlibrium within the passenger compartment which holds under the condition of varying outlet duct air temperature valves is discussed. In order to keep the passenger compartment air temperature constant, it is necessary to equalize the heat quantity supplied by the air conditioning system with the thermal load applied to the passenger compartment. Such an equilibrium state is established when the outlet duct temperature is shifted from an initial value to a point where the passenger compartment air temperature obtained by the equlibrium characteristic curve T shown in Fig. 3 a is equal to the passenger compartment air temperature level shown inFig. 3 b to which the outlet duct air temperature is controlled. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 3 c , a stable point P of the passenger compartment air temperature is obtained as an.intersection of the characteristic curves T and S shown in Figs. 3 a and 3 b . Fig. 4 shows the temperature control characteristic and also the above explained heat equilibrium conditions of the prior art air conditioning system against a plurality of thermal load conditions such as, an outside air temperatures. In the case of the prior art control circuit shown in Fig. 2, the output level characteristic of the bridge circuit, in other words, change in the output voltage of the bridge circuit against various temperature levels, is determined so that the above explained heat equilibrium condition is established at a preset passenger compartment air temperature To on one of heat equilibrium curves shown in Fig. 4, corresponding to a selected outside air temperature value TA, for example,TA 10 C. By way of example, the resistancetemperature characterist ic of the thermistor, that is, the passenger compartment air temperature sensor Rp is adjusted at first so that a heat equilibrium is established at To 250C against an outside air temperature of lO0C, as shown by a point A of Fig 4.Then, the resistance temperature characteristic of the outside air temparature sensor Razzs adjusted so that the heat equlibrium is established also at To 250C against a different outside air temperature of 100C as shown by a point B of Fig. 4. In this case, the resistancetemperature characteristic of the thermistors Rp, Ra are corrected by respectively providing an adjustable variable resistance in series or in parallel therewith.By the above correction, the resistance temperature characteristic of the bridge circuit is precisely adjusted against the different outside air temperatures of 10 C and 100C, as shown by dashed lines S1 and Sp inFig. 4, and precise control of the passenger compartment air temperature is possible at points and B. However, in the case of the above control circuit including a bridge circuit, since the temperature control characteristic is greately dependent on the resistancetemperature characteristics of the thermistors used in the bridge circuit, it is very difficult to effect an accurate control of the passenger compartment air temperature throughout a wide range of the outside air temperatrue, such as from 30 C to 400C. For example, when the outside temperature is higher than 10 C or lower than 10 C, such as at 30 C or 300C, an error between the preset value To and the actually settled value Tp of the passenger compartment air temperature is inevitably developed, such as an error d at eqilibrium points C and D shown in Fig. 4. The present invention is explained hereinafter with reference to Figs. 5 a to 7 of the accompanied drawings. The heat quantity equilibrium as the basic concept of the present invention is explained first. In order to maintain the temperature within the passenger compartment, the heat quantity QAC supplied by an air conditioner system must be equal to the thermal load applied to the vehicle heat from solar ray, outside air, ventilated air, a passenger, and equipment such as the engine, and so on . Therefore, an equilibrium equation is expressed as follows QAC QT QV QS QM QI .... Cl where QT is the heat quantity absorbed into or radiated from the passenger compartment due to difference in temperature between outside and inside air, QV is the heat quantity introduced thereinto or discharged therefrom due to ventilation, QS is the heat quantity absorbed thereinto as solar heat, is is the heat quantity radiated from passenger s body, and QI is the heat quantity radiated from equipements within the vehicle, such as an engine. The above mentioned heat quantity QAC to be supplied to the passenger compartment is determined by the difference in temperature between air discharged from an air conditioning system TAC and air within a passenger compartment TP. The thermal loads QT and QV are determined by the difference in temperature between outside air TA and inside, that is, passenger compartment air Tp. The solar heat temperature T5 is determined by incident solar energy.Accordingly, since QM and QI are roughly constant, the above equation 1 can be expressed as follows TAC aTp bTA cTs d .... 2 where TAC is the target temperature of the air discharged from the air conditioning system, Tp is the passenger compartment air temperature, TA is the outside air temperature, T5 is the solar heat temperature, and a, b, c, and d are constants. Now if the temperature of air discharged from the air conditining system when a passenger compartment air temperature Tp reaches a preset temperature TO is considered as a basic outlet duct air temparature TACO, the following equation can be obtained from equation 2 , because Tp is Tg TACO aTO bTA cTS d .... 3 By comparing equations 2 and 3 , it is possible to obtain the target outlet duct air temperature T AC as follows TAC TACO T .... 4 T alpha To Tp .... 5 Fig. 5 a is a schematic block diagram of a first embodiment of air conditioning system according to the present invention, where the reference numaral 30 denotes an outside temperature sensor for generating a signal indicative of the outside temperature TA, 31 denotes a solar heat sensor for generating a signal indicative of the solar heat temperature Ts, 32 denotes a passenger compartment air temperature presetting device, 33 denotes a passenger compartment air temperature sensor for sensing the passenger compartment air temperature Tg, 34 denotes an outlet duct air temperture .sensor for sensing an outlet duct air temperature TD, and 35 denotes an analog to digital converter for converting the analog signals from the above sensors and presetting device 30 to 34 into corresponding digital signals. The numeral 40 denotes an arithmetic control unit including a base outlet duct air temperature calculating unit 41 for digitally calculating the base outlet duct air temperature TACO in accordance with the equation 3 described hereinabove, a temperature correction value calculating unit 42 for digitally calculating the temperature correction value AT in accordance with the equation 5 described hereinabove, an adding unit 43 for producing a target outlet duct temperature TAC by adding the temperature correction value to the basic outlet duct temperature TACO, and a comparator 44 for comparing a detected outlet duct air temperature TD with the target outlet duct temperature TAC. The constant values a to d in equations 2 to 5 are stored in an appropriate memory means provided within the arithmetic control unit 40. 45 denotes a digital to analog converter for converting the digital output signal of the comparator 44 into an analog signal. The reference numeral 46 indicates an actuator driver which is responsive to the output signal of the digital to analog converter 45, such as the solenoid values 13 and 14 shown in Fig. 1. The numeral 47 indicates an actuator such as the actuator 11 shown in Fig. 1 for adjusting the air mix door position in accordance with the control vacuum of the actuator driver 46. The operation of the above system is now explained with reference to the flow chart shown in Fig 6. In a .step P1, signals from the analog to digital converter 35, respectively indicative of the solar heat temperaure Tis, the outside air temperature TA, the passenger compartment air temperature T and the preset value of the passenger compartment air temperature To and the detected value of the outlet duct air temperature TD are read into the airthmetic control unit 40. Nextly, in a step P2, the base outlet duct air temperature TAC is arithmetically calculated in accordance with the above mentioned equation 3 onthe basis of the solar heat temperature Ts, outside air temperature TA, and a preset value of the passenger compartment air temperaure To Then, in a step P3, the temperature correction value dT is arithmetically calculated in accordance with the above mentioned equation 5 , on the basis of the preset and detected value of the passenger compartment air temperature, and so calculated temperature correction value AT is added to the base outlet duct air temperatureTACO for producing the target outlet duct air temperatureTAC.In a step P4, whether or not the detected value of the outlet duct air temperatue TD is equal to the target outlet duct air temperature TAC is detected. In this step, if there is a difference between the detected and the target values of the outlet duct air temperature TD,TAC, an actuator drive signal is produced in a step P5 for actuating one of the control valves 14 and 15. These steps P4 and P5 are repeated until the detected outlet duct air temperatue TD becomes equal to the target outlet duct air temperature TAC Fig. 5 b is a schematic diagram of a second embodiment of the air conditioning system according to the present invention, in which a micro computer is used in place of the arithemetic control unit 40 shown inFig. 5 a . In the figure, the numeral 401 denotes a micro computer having a central processing unit CPU 401 to execute various arithmetic operation in accordance with stored programs, a read only memory ROM 402 which stores necessary programs, and a random access memory RAM 403 in which various data and calculated results are stored during execution of arithmetic operations, in the same manner as the preveous embodiment, the signals indicative of the temperature values as described in the previous embodiment are converted into corresponding digital signals at an analog to digital converter 35 and then input into the CPU 401. The ROM 403 stores program necessary to carry out the operation shown in Fig. 6. The CPU 401 calculates a base outlet duct air temperature TACO, in accordance with the predetermined equation 3 , and the temperature correction value in accordance with the predetermined equation 5 . The CPU 401, then produces the target outlet duct temperature TAC by adding the caluculated value of the temperature correction value 2 T to the base outlet duct temperature TACO. The target outlet duct temperature TAC is then compared with the actually detected outlet duct air temperature TD by the CPU 401.If the detected outlet duct air temperature TD is not equal to the target outlet duct air temperature TAC, an actuator drive signal is input from the CPU 401 into the actuator driver 46 via the digital to analog converter 45, in order to adjust the position of the air mix door until the detected outlet duct temperature TD becomes equal to the target outlet duct temperature TAC Fig. 7 shows a temperature control charateristic of the above explained air conditioning system according to the present invention. AS shown, when an appropriate preset value of the passenger compartment air temperature To is given, and the detected outside air temperature TA has the value of, for example, 10 CC, the base outlet duct air temperature is arithmetically calculated in accordance with the heat equilibrium equation on the basis of the thermal load characteristic T1 at the outside air temperature TA of 10 OC. Then, the temperature control characteristic S1 corresponding to the outside air temperature of 1OOC is determined in accordance with the calculated value of the base outlet duct air temperature TACO. Then if the outside air temperature is changed to 100C, under the same passenger compartment temperature preset value To the base outlet duct air temperature is shifted to a point TACO by an amount on the basis of the thermal load characteristic T2 at the outside air temperatue of 1O0C. Accordingly, the temperature control characteristic of the air conditioning system is shifted to the dashed line S2 corresponding to the new value of the outside air temperature TA. In this way, the temperature control characteristic of the air conditioning system is automatically altered on the basis of the calculated value of the base outlet duct air temperature TACO. Therefore, it is possible to effect an accurate control of the outlet duct air temperature and the passenger compartment air temperature is precisely maintained at a desired preset value reagrdless of the change in the magnitude of the thermal load applied to the passenger compartment. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that foregoing description is in terms of preferred embodiment of the present invention wherein various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as set forth in the appended claims. For example, a signal indicative of an air mix door position can be used in place of the signal indiactive of the detected outlet duct air temperature TD which is used in the case of the preferred embodiment. In such a case, the system can be constructed so that a target air mix door opening degree is produced by combining respectively calulated value of a basb air mix door opening degree and a correction value obtained by similar manners as the case of the base outlet duct air temperature and the temperature correction value of the preferred embodiments, and so that the air mix door position is adjusted so as to minimize the difference between the calculated target air mix door opening degree and the detected value of the air mix door opening degree.
