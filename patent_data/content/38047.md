# Cracking catalyst composition, passivating process and germanium compounds.

## Abstract
A cracking catalyst composition comprising a cracking catalyst contacted with a treating agent selected from germanium and germanium compounds. Passivation of the detrimental effect of contaminating metals on the cracking catalyst by treating them with germanium or germanium compounds. A germanium compound represented by the formula CHEM wherein R is alkyl having from one to 6 carbon atoms.
