## Description
The present invention relates to a novel peptide, a gene coding for the peptide, a process for production of the peptide using the gene inserted to an expression vector, and use of the peptide. A normal regulation of the blood pressure in a human body is important for the maintenance of personal health, and various physical and humoral factors contribute to this regulation of the blood vessels, etc. The humoral factors include, for example, the reninangiotensin aldosterone system, catecholamines, prostaglandins, kinin kallikrein system, and natriuretic hormones including ouabain like substances. Herein the term natriuretic will denote selective excretion of sodium cation relating to potassium cation. Granules morphologically similar to granules present in peptide hormone producing cells are found in human atrium J.D. Jamieson and G.E. Palade, Moreover, a peptide consisting of 28 amino acids derived from rat atrium cordis was identified wherein Cys at the 7 position and Cys at the 23 position are bonded through a disulfide bond. Various kinds of physiologically active peptides are known to be derived On the basis of the above mentioned findings, the present inventors expected that the above mentioned α hANP would be derived from a corresponding precursor, and actually found a new peptide, derived from human atrium cordis, consisting of 126 amino acids including the 28 amino acids of α hANP. Moreover, the present inventors successfully obtained a gene coding for the new peptide, and constructed plasmids containing the gene which expresses in a microorganism. Therefore, the present invention provides a new peptide consisting of 126 amino acids and having diuretic action and hypotensive or antihypertensive action. The peptide is hereinafter referred to as γ human atrial natriuretic polypeptide and abbreviated as γ hANP . There is also provided a DNA fragment comprising a base sequence coding for a peptide occurring in human atrium cordis and having diuretic action. There are also provided plasmids containing a promotor region, SD sequence, and the above mentioned DNA fragment, and capable of producing a peptide coded by the DNA fragment in a microoganism. There is also provided a microorganism transformed with the plasmid. The present invention further provides a process for the production of the γ hANP by culturing the transformed microorganism in a culture medium and recovering the γ hANP from the cultured cells or medium, or converting the peptide to or from an acid addition salt. The present invention further extends to provide a pharmaceutical composition containing the γ hANP as a diuretic or hypotensor. Aspects are set out in the claims. The invention will be further explained and embodiments and examples set forth, in the description below, referring to the drawings in which RNA were extracted from human atrium cordis by a method disclosed in Chirgwin Chirgwin, J. M. et. al., Biochemistry On the other hand, a peptide having a molecular weight of about 13,000 Dalton was isolated from human atrium cordis. The peptide was sequenced, and determined to have an amino acid sequence set forth in Fig. 1 described below in detail . The amino acid sequence of the peptide extracted from human atrium cordis is identical with an expected amino acid sequence from the 26 position to 151 position in Fig. 5. This means that the cDNA fragment in the plasmid phANP82 contains a base sequence coding for γ hANP. The cDNA fragment also contains an additional base sequence coding for an amino acid sequence from Met at position 1 to Ala at position 25 in Fig. 5. The amino acid sequence from 1 to 25 is believed to be a signal peptide which participates in the secretion of a peptide. As shown above and in Fig. 5, the cDNA region in the plasmid phANP82 consists of a 5 non translation region of 90 bp, a coding region of 453 bp, and a 3 non translation region of 300 bp. The coding region consists of a region coding for a signal sequence of from 1 to 25 in amino acid position and a region coding for γ hANP peptide of from 26 to 151 in amino acid position. The region coding for γ hANP peptide includes a region coding for α hANP peptide of from 124 to 151 in amino acid position. The above mentioned relationship between α hANP and γ hANP supports the expectation that γ hANP is a precursor of α hANP. When α hANP is derived from γ hANP, an amide bond of the Pro Arg sequence present at 122 and 123 in Fig. 5, i.e., an amide bond between Arg Ser at 123 and 124, has to be cleaved. This possibility is strongly suggested from a phenomenon wherein gastrin releasing peptide is derived from its precursor by cleavage of an amide bond of the Pro Arg sequence present in the precursor Reave, J.R. et. al., J. Biol. Chem. 258, 5582 5588, 1983 and Minamino, N. et. al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. As DNA fragments cloned into plasmids phANP1 and phANP82 contain a base sequence coding for γ hANP, and therefore α hANP, both of which have natriuretic or diuretic action and hypotensive or antihypertensive action, the DNA fragments are useful for the industrial production of γ hANP and α hANP and other diuretic peptides having an amino acid sequence present in the γ hANP. For the construction of a recombinant DNA containing a base sequence coding for γ hANP and useful for expression of the γ hANP gene, a restriction enzyme To construct an expression plasmid, the plasmid M13mp8 hANP525 was cleaved with The plasmid pS220 was transformed into Moreover, plasmid pS223 3 and pS224 3 were constructed. The plasmid pS223 3 was constructed from plasmid pS83 3 and an While the molecular weight about 20Kd shown on the SDS PAGE is higher than a theoretical molecular weight of γ hANP 13,679 Dalton , the protein showing about 20Kd was determined to be γ hANP because γ hANP prepared from human atrium cordis migrates to a site corresponding to 20Kd on the SDS PAGE, and because the SDS PAGE often shows a molecular weight higher than a theoretical molecular weight for other proteins. This conclusion was confirmed as follows a chemically synthesized linker, wherein the underlined portions are translation termination codons, and each of the codons corresponds to any one of three kinds of reading frames, was incorporated into a site downstream of the γ hANP gene in a expression plasmid. The Thus, it was confirmed that γ hANP, which is a precursor of α hANP, can be produced by a microorganism using a recombinant gene according to the present invention. Herein, although constructions of plasmids containing a base sequence coding for an amino acid sequence from 26 to 151 in Fig. 5 γ hANP as a coding region are represented, other plasmids containing a base sequence coding for an amino acid sequence from 1 to 151 in Fig. 5 signal sequence and γ hANP , and plasmids containing a base sequence coding for an amino acid sequence from 124 to 151 α hANP or any other amino acid sequence as a coding region can be constructed by the same procedure. Moreover, although cDNA corresponding to mRNA prepared from human atrium cordis was represented as a γ hANP gene, gene coding for γ hANP can be chemically synthesized. Moreover, although the λP γ hANP can be produced by the extraction of the γ hANP from human atrium. In the process, human atrium is homogenized in an acidic aqueous solution such as a phosphate buffer solution, or an acetic acid solution containing hydrochloric acid. Subsequently, γ hANP is purified according to a conventional method suitable for the purification of peptide, such as centrifugation, isoelectric point precipitation, solvent extraction, ultrafiltration, gel filtration, adsorption chromatography or high performance liquid chromatography HPLC , or a combination of such methods. In the above mentioned methods, chicken rectum relaxation activity is conveniently used to select fractions containing γ hANP, because γ hANP has this activity. In the chromatography methods, the α hANP containing fractions can be also selected by molecular weight about 14,000 . The γ hANP according to the present invention has notable diuretic, and hypotensive or antihypertensive actions. Male rats weighing 300 to 400 grams were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of pentobarbital at a dosage of 60 mg kg, and used for tests on the γ hANP according to the method described in To keep the respiratory tract open, a tracheal cannula PE 240 Clay Adams was inserted into the trachea. An arterial cannula PE 50 was inserted into a femoral artery for measurement of the blood pressure, and a venous cannula was inserted into a femoral vein for the administration of Ringer s solution. 1.2 ml of Ringer s solution was injected for ten minutes, and subsequently, was constantly infused at a flow rate of 1.2 ml hour. A bladder cannula made of silastic tube with a inner diameter of 0.02 inches and an outer diameter of 0.037 inches was inserted into the bladder, and via the cannula, a urine sample was collected into a test tube. The collection of urine was carried out for 30 minutes before administration of the test compound, and 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes after the administration. 1 nmole of the test compound γ hANP was dissolved in 50 µl of sterilized physiological saline with 5 µg of bacitracin, and the solution was injected into the jugular vein. As shown in Fig. 11, γ hANP shows a notable diuretic action. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 12, after 1 mole of γ hANP is administered to a rat, the blood pressure is gradually lowered by about 20 mmHg for about 1 hour, revealing that γ hANP has a hypotensive action or antihypertensive action, and may be useful as a hypotensor. Repeated administration of γ hANP does not stimulate production of antibodies, and does not cause anaphylaxis shock. γ hANP consisting of L amino acids is gradually hydrolysed in a body providing the L amino acids, and therefore shows little toxicity. Due to the higher diuretic, and blood pressure lowering or antihypertensive actions, and the lower toxicity, γ hANP and acid addition salts thereof are useful as an active ingredient for pharmaceutical compositions such as a diuretic and a hypotensor. γ hANP is administered at 1 µg kg to 10 mg kg, preferably 10 µg kg to 1 mg kg. γ hANP can be administered in the same manner as conventional peptide type pharmaceuticals. Namely, γ hANP is preferably administered parenterally, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, or subcutaneously. γ hANP, when administered orally, may be proteolytically hydrolyzed. Therefore, oral application is not usually effective. However, γ hANP can be administered orally as a formulation wherein γ hANP is not easily hydrolyzed in a digestive tract, such as liposome microcapsules. γ hANP may be also administered in suppositories, sublingual tablets, or intranasal spray. The parenterally administered pharmaceutical composition is an aqueous solution containing about 0.000005 to 5 , preferably 0.00005 to 0.5 of γ hANP, which may contain, in addition to γ hANP as an active ingredient, for example, buffers such as phosphate, acetate, etc., osmotic pressure adjusting agents such as sodium chloride, sucrose, and sorbitol, etc., antioxidative or antioxygenic agents, such as ascorbic acid or tochopherol, and preservatives, such as antibiotics. The parenterally administered composition also may be a solution readily usable or in a lyophilized form which is dissolved in sterile water before administration. The present invention will now be further illustrated by, but is by no means limited to, the following examples. From two human atrium cordis obtained from an 82 year old female and 61 year old male, 1 mg of RNA was extracted with 4M guanidium thiocyanate according to a method of Chirgwin et al. Chirgwin, J.M. et. al., Biochemistry About 40,000 colonies were replicated on a nitrocellulose filter, and the filter was incubated on an LB agar plate supplemented with 40 γ ml of ampicillin at 37 C for 6 hours. The filter was transferred onto an LB agar plate supplemented with 180 γ ml of chloramphenicol, and incubated at 37 C over night. The colonies on the filter were lysated with 0.5N NaOH, and neutralized to pH 7.0, and the filter was soaked in 0.5 M Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1.5 N NaCl, and in 3 x SCC 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05M sodium citrate for 5 minutes respectively. Finally, cell debris on the filter was removed with a paper towel, and the filter was air dried and then baked at 80 C for 2 hours. The filters were then subjected to hybridization with a mixture of probes I and II Fig. 9 consisting of chemically synthesized 14 mer oligonucleotides labeled with ³²p at their 5 end Grunstein, M. Hogness, D.S., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Restriction enzyme sites of the insert DNA region and a strategy for sequencing the insert DNA region are set forth in Fig. 10. In Fig. 10, the direction for sequencing is shown by arrows, wherein solid lines show an upper strand and dotted lines show a lower strand. The sequencing was carried out according to the Maxam Gilbert method Meth. Enzym., As a result of the above mentioned sequencing, it was comfirmed that the base sequences of inserts present in the plasmids phANP1 and phANP82 were identical except that the insert in the plasmid phANP1 has an additional base sequence of about 100bp as the 5 non translation region. Figure 5 shows the base sequence of the insert in phANP82 and an amino acid sequence corresponding to an open reading frame in the insert. The insert DNA contains the reading frame starting from ATG and ending at a translation termination codon TGA, and the reading frame includes a base sequence coding for α hANP at the 3 terminal side C terminal side in the amino acid sequence . On the basis of an amino acid sequence of γ hANP purified from human atrium cordis and identified, which has an N terminal sequence H Asn Pro Met Tyr Asn ... and C terminal sequence ... Asn Ser Phe Arg Tyr OH as set forth in Fig. 1, the reading frame was confirmed to contain a coding region of from codon AAT of Asn at 26 to codon ATC of Tyr at 151 in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5, an amino acid sequence of from Met at 1 to Ala at 25 is considered from its characteristic sequence to be a signal sequence participating in the secretion of peptide. The base sequence in Fig. 5 also contains a sequence AATAAA shown by a solid underlining, which sequence is known to precede polyadenylation site in many eukaryotic mRNA. 0.44 µg of M13mp8 RF DNA was cleaved with 16 units of 66 ng of the DNA fragment from M13mp8 RF DNA and 1 µg of the 700 bp DNA fragment were ligated using 5.6 units of T4 DNA ligase Takara Shuzo, Japan in 20 µl of ligation buffer 20 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 10 mM MgCl₂ , 1 mM ATP, 5 mM DTT at 14 C for 16 hours.

The precipitated phage was dissolved in 100 µl of TE buffer 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA , and to the solution 50 µl of phenol saturated with water was added, the mixture was vigorously stirred for 5 minutes, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes. After sampling 80 µl of the aqueous phase, to the aqueous phase 3 µl of 3M sodium acetate, pH 8.0, and 200 µl of ethanol was added, and the mixture was cooled at 70 C for 10 minutes, and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes to precipitate DNA. The precipitated DNA was washed once with ethanol, and dissolved in 50 µl of the above mentioned TE buffer. A part of a base sequence of each phage DNA was sequenced according to the dideoxy chain termination method Methods in Enzymology, To 5 µl of the single strand phage DNA solution described above, 1 µl of 0.2M Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1M MgCl₂ and 0.5M NaCl, and 2 µl of water, were added 2 µl of solution containing 10 pmole of 36 mer chemically synthesized DNA fragment 5 CTCCTAGGTCAGGAATTCATGAATCCCATGTACAAT 3 phosphorylated at the 5 end to form 10 µl of a mixture. The mixture was heated at 65 C for 5 minutes, and allowed to stand for 10 minutes at room temperature. To the mixture, 1 µl of 0.2 M Tris HCl buffer pH7.5 containing 0.1 M MgCl, 2 µl of 0.1 M DTT, 1 µl of 10 mM ATP, 2 µl each of 10 mM dATP, dDTP, dCTP and dTTP, 2 µl of water, 5 units of DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment Boehringer Manheim and 2.8 units of T4 DNA ligase Takara Shuzo were added, and the mixture was incubated at 15 C for 16 hours. 20 µl of the reaction mixture was used to transform As described above for the preparation of phage DNA, plagues were formed on a YT soft agar medium, and 48 clones were selected. The clones were inoculated to 2 x YT medium, and cultured at 37 C for 8 hours. 1 ml of the cultured medium was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes to recover the supernatant as phage solution. On the other hand, RF DNA was extracted and isolated from the precipitated cells according to the alkaline extraction method Birnboim, H.C. Doly, J., Nucl. Acid. Res., To 400 ml of 2 X YT liquid medium, 0.4 ml of culture of An expression plasmid pS220 was constructed from plasmid pS20 and M13mp8 hANP525. The starting plasmid pS20 was constructed by the inventors, and The plasmid pS20 was constructed as follows. Bacteriophage λC1857 DNA was cleaved with Starting with the plasmid pS20 and M13mp8 hANP525, the γ hANP expression vector pS220 was constructed as follows. To 70 µl of In addition to the γ hANP gene expression vector pS220, other γ hANP gene expression vectors were constructed as follows. Plasmid pS20 Fig. 6 was cleaved with Another γ hANP gene expression vector pS224 3 was constructed as follows. The plasmid pS83 3 was cleaved with Three transformants, i.e., As shown in Fig. 7, for cultures at 42 C of three transformants, i.e., N4830 pS220, N4830 pS223 3, and N4830 pS224 3,a protein band corresponding to a molecular weight of 20Kd was found. The 20Kd band was not found for a culture at 32 C of the three transformants, and a culture at 32 C and 42 C of the control strain. This means that a protein corresponding to the 20Kd band was produced by expression of the γ hANP gene under the λP 377 g of human atrium cordis was removed and boiled in ten volumes of 1 M acetic acid aqueous solution for 10 minutes, to inactivate protease present in the atrium cordis. The boiled atrium cordis in the acetic acid solution was then cooled to 4 C, added with cooled acetone to two volumes and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer to extract the γ hANP. The homogenate thus obtained was centrifuged at 16000 XG for 30 minutes to obtain a supernatant. From the supernatant, acetone was removed by vacuum distillation to obtain 150 ml of an extract containing γ hANP. To the extract water was added to 1ℓ of total volume, and the diluted extract was subjected to reverse column chromatography using 90 ml of LCSORB SP C ODS column Chemco . The charged column was washed with 450 ml of 0.1 N acetic acid solution, and eluted with 450 ml of a mixed eluent of water acetonitrile 10 trifluoroacetic acid 40 60 1 . The elute was fractionated to a green fraction at an early stage and a brown fraction at a later stage. 225 ml of the green fraction was then lyophilized to obtain 90 mg of dried residue. The residue thus obtained was dissolved in 5 ml of 1 N acetic acid, and the solution was subjected to gel filtration using a Sephadex G 75 column Pharmacia, 1.8 x 135 cm equilibrated with a 1 N acetic acid solution.

The column was equilibrated with eluent A , and 250 µl of the active fraction obtained from the Sephadex G 75 column was applied to the column. Elution was carried out by linear gradient from A to B at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min and at a pressure of 110 to 130 Kg cm² for 80 minutes. The result is set forth in Fig. 14. A peak fraction having chick rectum relaxation activity retention time 50 minutes was obtained, and subjected to HPLC using the same column.
