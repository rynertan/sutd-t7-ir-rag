# Pretreatment of catalytic dewaxing feedstocks.

## Abstract
Catalytically dewaxed lubricating base stock oils that have improved resistance to oxidation are produced by pretreating the waxy furfural raffinate with a zeolite sorbent prior to dewaxing with a zeolite catalyst such as ZSM 5, and conducting the dewaxing at a reduced temperature not to exceed about 357 C to 731 C 650 to 700 F .
