# Space diversity receiving system.

## Abstract
A space diversity receiving system in microwave band ra dio communication including two antennas A₁, A₂ and re ceivers RX₁, RX₂ , an endless phase shifter EPS , a hybrid combiner H₁ , a hybrid distributor H₂ , a voltage controlled oscillator VCO , a signal mixer MIX , a low pass filter LPF , a detector DT , and a control circuit CTL . Microwaves received by the antennas A₁, A₂ are de tected by the receivers RX₁, RX₂ . One received signal is di rectly applied to the hybrid combiner H₁ . The other received signal is applied to the hybrid combiner via the endless phase shifter EPS . The hybrid combiner H₁ combines these sig nals and outputs to the hybrid distributor H₂ . The hybrid di stributor distributes the amplified output to the intermediate frequency output and sub output. The voltage control oscilla tor VCO generates sequential frequency based on the control of its input voltage. The signal mixer MIX mixes the sub out put with the sequential frequency output. The detector DT detects the mixed signal and transmits the detected signal to the control circuit. The control circuit CTL controls the end less phase shifter and the voltage control oscillator based on the deviation in the intermediate frequency band and the detec tion of the reception level so as to minimize amplitude deviation of the combined IF output signal by using a microprocessor.
