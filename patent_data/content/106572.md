# Data processing system with virtual machines.

## Abstract
A data processing system comprises at least two operating systems OS1, OS2 for virtual machines, a super visory operating system, i.e. a control program CP for controlling the operating systems, control registers CR0, CR1, , and an extended control register ECR having a special bit. When a control register operating instruction LCTC or STCTC is generated from the operating systems under the condition that the special bit has a first value, the operating systems directly access the control register. When such a control register operating instruction is generated under the condition that the special bit has a second value, an interruption is generated in the supervisory operating system.
