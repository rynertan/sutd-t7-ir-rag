## Description
METHOD FOR EXPRESSING FOREIGN GENES IN SCHIZOSACCHAROMyCES POMBE AND THE USE IN THERAPEUTIC FORi LATIONS OF THE PRODUCTS, DNA CONSTRUCTS AND TPANSPOP ENT STRAINS OF SACCHAROMYCES POMBE USABLE IN SUCH METHOD AND THEIR PREPARATIONThe present invention is directed to methods for expressing heterologous polypeptides in the fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe, to DNA vectors useful therein, and to protein products expressed thereby.In the field of genetic engineering where the object is normally to obtain high expression of a polypeptide product, usually a mammalian protein, in a microorganism, the choice of the host organism may be critical. Some work has been done in the eucaryotic organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae Baker s yeast . However, whether other eucaryotic microorganisms may achieve similar or even higher levels of expression of heterologous proteins was not heretofore known. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is only distantly related to S. cerevisiae and the two genera differ in many aspects of biochemistry and physiology. Such differences, for example, may be reflected in possible different levels and or specificities of proteases in the different species which may degrade heterologous proteins.Also, the yeast genera may differ in enzymes which modify heterologous proteins, which may involve differing specific cleavage sites, sulfhydryl bridges, glycosylation, amino terminal modifications and the like. Depending upon the particular heterologous protein which one may express, such specific modifications may be desirable or undesirable. Furthermore, different yeast genera may contain different proteins which in some cases may be more difficult than others to purify away from the desired heterologous protein.Also, at certain levels the presence of heterologous proteins may have a detrimental effect on cell viability, so it may be desirable to determine which yeast genera may be most tolerant to the particular desired protein. The secretion processes may differ among yeast genera, therefore one may be able to take advantage of such properties, for example, a particular heterologous protein may be secreted at a higher level in one genus versus another, or undesirable proteases and protein modifying enzymes may be secreted at a lower level while the heterologous protein is secreted at a higher level in certain genera. Finally, yeast genera may differ in their growth rates or yields in different media at different temperatures and pressures, thereby affecting time and cost of production.It is therefore desirable to provide a method of producing foreign proteins in different eucaryotic organisms to take advantage of such differences in characteristics. In most cases, such differences in characteristics may not be determined a priori.It is therefore an aspect of the present invention to provide methods for producing heterologous proteins in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces combe.It is a further aspect of the present invention to provide DNA vectors which are useful for expressing heterologous proteins in S. pombe. It is another aspect of the present invention to provideDNA expression vectors comprising S. pombe alcohol dehydrogenase promoter.It is a further aspect of the present invention to provide substantially pure unglycosylated human alpha l antitrypsin produced by Schizosaccharomyces pombe.In the accompanying FIGURES FIG. 1 is the cDNA sequence of the gene coding for the predominant form of human alpha l antitrypsin.FIG. 2 illustrates a partial sequence of pUC13 including the linker.FIG. 3 illustrates a method of preparation of vectorHAT 4.FIG. 4 illustrates the restriction map of vector C1 1, a vector utilized in preparation of HAT 4.FIG. 5 illustrates the restriction map of the vector pUC a l FG1, an intermediate vector used in the preparation of HAT 4.FIG. 6 illustrates the restriction map of HAT 4.FIG. 7 illustrates a method of preparing vector pR103 5, an expression vector for producing alpha l antitrypsin in S. pombe.FIG. 8 illustrates the restriction map of pR103 5. The present invention is directed to a method for producing a heterologous protein in yeast genus S. pombe comprising the step of growing a culture of the yeast transformed by a DNA vector containing a segment coding for an S. pombe promoter, whereby expression of the protein is under regulation of the promoter. DNA constructs useful for making such vectors are also provided. In particular, a vector is constructed comprising the S. pombe alcohol dehydrogenase promoter and the structural gene for human alpha l antitrypsin which is transformed into S. pombe. Growth of the transformant produces a substantially unglycosylated protein having the activity of mammalian alpha l antitrypsin. This protein may be isolated in a substantially pure form.In order to express heterologous proteins in S. pombe, it is desirable to have the expression under control of a promoter which is indigenous to S. pombe. Such a promoter may be the approximately 700 base pairSph 1 Eco RI fragment comprising the S. pombe ADH promoter which may be isolated from plasmid pADHpoI, a plasmid which is disclosed by Russell et al., J.Biol.Chem., 258, 143 149 1983 , the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Other S. pombe promoters may include the glycolytic pathway promoters, such as, triose phosphate isomerase, phosphofructo kinase, glyceraldrhyde 3phosphate dehydrogenase.The heterologous protein selected for expression is alpha I antitrypsin, a protease inhibitor present in mammalian blood whose apparently major physiological function is to inhibit elastase, a potent protease which hydrolyzes structural proteins. Alpha l antitrypsin may also inhibit other serine proteases. A low level of alpha l antitrypsin in the blood may be associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary emphysema and infantile liver cirrhosis.Therefore, production of proteins having alpha l antitrypsin activity may be useful for treating alpha l antitrypsin deficiency and to examine the mechanism of the acute phase response which occurs under inflamatory conditions in the body whereby the concentration of alpha l antitrypsin is substantially increased.The gene for the predominant form of human alpha l antitrypsin is shown in FIG. 1. A DNA fragment comprising such gene which may be utilized may be derived from the plasmid HAT 4. The construction of HAT 4 is illustrated generally in FIG. 3.To prepare HAT 4, the intermediate vector Cl 1 is utilized. Referring to FIG. 3, the S. cerevisiae TPI promoter, described by Alber and Kawasaki, J.Molec.Appl. Genet., 1, 419 434 1982 is digested with Bal3l exonuclease from the KpnI restriction site within the TPI coding region. The resultant blunt end is converted to a Eco RI sticky end by the addition of a 5 blunt endEco RI adaptor. A synthetic oligonucleotide linker having the sequence AATTCATGGAGGATCC is ligated to theEco RI sticky end, then digested with Bam HI. The resultant fragment comprising the TPI promoter may be inserted into the Bam HI site of the vector C1 1. The restriction map of Cl l is shown in FIG. 4. The Cl l plasmid was constructed from plasmid pJDB248 Beggs,Nature, 275, 104 109 1978 by removing the pMB9 sequences from pud3248 by a partial digestion withEco RI. Eco RI digested pBR322 was then inserted to give Cl l. It will be noted that the linker sequence, in addition to providing Eco RI and Bam HI restriction sites, also supplies an ATG initiation codon and a GAG codon, which codes for glutamic acid, the first amino acid of naturally occurring human alpha l antitrypsin.Therefore, these codons are in frame when the rest of the alpha l antitrypsin structural gene is inserted at the Bam HI site.The gene coding for the predominant form of human alpha l antitrypsin shown in FIG. 1 may be isolated from a human cDNA library using the baboon sequence Kurachi et al., PNAS USA, 78, 6826 6830 1981 andChandra et al., Biochem.Biophys.Res.Com., 103, 751 758 1981 as a DNA hybridization probe. This gene may then be inserted as a Pstl fragment, as shown in FIG. 3 into vector pUC13 prepared as described by Vieira et al., Gene, 19, 259 268 1982 for vectors pUC8 and pUC9, but containing the multiple restriction site shown inFIG. 2 at start of the lacZ gene at the single Pstl site in put13. In the resultant construct the antitrypsin gene was followed by an XbaI site and an Eco RI site in the multiple cloning sequence.Therefore, between these two sites was inserted the yeast TPI terminator as a 700 base pair XbaI Eco RI fragment from pTPICl0. The plasmid pTPIC10 is described by Alber andKawasaki, J.Molec.App.Gene., 1, 419 434 1982 . The resultant plasmid shown in FIG. 3 is pUCa 1 FG1 which contains the human alpha i antitrypsin with a yeast transcription terminator. A detailed structure of pUCa i FG1 is shown in FIG. 5.Referring to FIG. 3 an Eco RI, Bam HI synthetic DNA adaptor is then added to the Eco RI site of pUCa l FG1 in order to create a Bam HI site on the 3 end of the yeast terminator. By using this adaptor the human aIpha l antitrypsin yeast terminator sequence may be removed by cutting with Bam HI to liberate a fragment of approximately 2100 base pairs. This Bam HI fragment is then inserted into the modified C1 1 plasmid containing the TPI promoter with Bam HI adaptor. The resultant plasmid HAT 4 contains the TPI promoter, ATGGAG adaptor, human alpha l antitrypsin gene and TPI terminator. A detailed structure of HAT 4 is shown in FIG. 6. Referring to FIG. 7, HAT 4 was digested with Eco RI and HindIII and the approximately 1400 base pair Hind III Eco RI fragment was isolated.This fragment was ligated to theEco RI Sph I 700 base pair fragment containing the S.pombe ADH promoter discussed above. The resultantHind III Sph I linear segment was then inserted into SphI and Hind III digested shuttle vector pCAS. Plasmid pCAS is a derivative of CV13 also known as YEpl3 Broach et al., Gene, 8, 121 123 1979 in which the single Sstl site has been destroyed by cutting withSstl, blunting the ends with T4 DNA polymerase and dNTP s, and religating the linear molecule. The final construct shown in FIGURE 7 containing the S. pombe ADH promoter, alpha l antitrypsin coding sequence, and TPI terminator is known as pR103 5. A detailed structure of pR103 5 is shown in FIG. 8. This plasmid also contains the S. cerevisiae LEU2 gene which complements the leul 32 mutation of S. pombe.The plasmid pR103 5 may be used to transform S. pombe strains by conventional techniques. Growth of the transformed cells will result in expression of polypeptides exhibiting the protease inhibition activity of human alpha l antitrypsin. These proteins may be useful for treatment of genetic alpha l antitrypsin deficiency and other disease states related to inadequate levels of the alpha l antitrypsin. Thus, conditions such as emphysema and other lung disorders related to progressive digestion of lung sacs may be treated, such as, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or adult respiratory distress syndrome. Non genetically related emphysema may be also be treated, such as, emphysema resulting from heavy smoking.Conditions not necessarily confined to the lungs may also be treated, such as, cystic fibrosis and arthritis. For a review of alpha l antitrypsin in deficiency see Gadek, J. E., and R.Crystl, Alpha l Antitrypsin Deficiency , The MetabolicBasis of Inherited Disease, J. B. Stanbury, J. B.Wyngaarden and D. S. Fredrickson, McGraw Hill, New York, pages 1450 1467 1982 .The proteins according to the present invention may be admixed with conventional pharmaceutical carriers.Preferably the proteins may be administered intraveneously or by inhalation. While effective dosages may vary according to the severity of the condition and weight of the subject, dosages in the range of 0.5 to 10.0 gm wk of a protein introduced intraveneously may, in many cases, be effective. Lower dosages may be effective if the method of administration is by inhalation. Oral administration may also be effective prpvided the alpha l antitrypsin is protected in capsules or coded carriers from premature degradation in the digestive tract. The following examples set forth specific embodiments according to the present invention, but the invention is not intended to be limited thereto. EXAMPLE 1EXPRESSION OF PROTEINS HAVING ALPHA 1 ANTITRYPSINACTIVITY FROM S. POMBE.The pR103 5 expression vector is used to transform S.pombe strain PR118 4 h , leul 32 , ATCC Deposit No. 20680. The strain is obtained by crossing strainPR131 h , leul 32 , described by Kohli et al.,Genetics, 87, 471 489 1977 , and strain PRP17 h , cdc10 129 , described by Nurse et al., Molecular andGeneral Genetics, 146, 167 168 1976 , and isolating clones which give consistent colony size. The transformed cells may be grown under selective conditions described by Russell et al., Nature, 301, 167 169 1983 . RNA analysis using Northern blots Thomas, PNASUSA, 77, 5201 5205 1980 and a 3 P labeled Eco Ri Hind III alpha l antitrypsin TPI terminator probe indicates that high level of transcription of alpha l antitrypsin cDNA is directed by the ADH promoter.Cell extracts from the log phase cultures grown under selective conditions are analyzed by ELISA assay and show 0.85 0.95 of total soluble protein to be protein exhibiting alpha l antitrypsin activity. EXAMPLE 2CHARACTERIZATION OF PROTEINS FROM S. POMBE EXHBITING ALPHA 1 ANTITRYPSIN ACTIVITY.Alpha l antitrypsin proteins from the S. pombe transformants above in Example 1 are further characterized by a purification on amino adsorption column and electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide SDS gel. The column is prepared by covalently attaching affinity purified antibodies to human alpha l antitrypsin to CNBractivated Sepharose accordins to the method ofCuatrecasas, J.Biochem., 245, 3059 1970 . Disrupted cells are extracted with phosphate buffered saline pH 7.2 containing 0.5m NaCl and applied to the column. The column is eluted with 3m NaSCN and the recovered material is analyzed by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The alpha i antitrypsin proteins which are produced in S.pombe have molecular weights in the range of 42 43 kdal.Naturally occurring human alpha l antitrypsin has a molecular weight of approximately 54 kdal., having a carbohydrate composition of approximately 16 by weight.See Hodges et al., J.Biochem., 254, 8208 8212 1979 .The proteins having alpha 1 antitrypsin activity produced by S. pombe will thus appear to be unglycosylated or substantially unglycosylated. EXAMPLE 3 ELISA Assay for ATTo assay for AT, 200 microliters of goat anti alpha lantitrypsin 10 micrograms mi in 0.lM Na2CO3 pH 9.8 that has been affinity purified is placed in each well of a 96 well microtiter culture plate at 370C for two to four hours. This solution is removed and 200 microliters of phosphate buffered saline PBS pH 7.2 containing 18 BSA and .05 Tween 20 is added to each well at 370C for two hours.Test samples, including standards, are then added to each well and AT, if present, binds to the specific antibody. The wells are rinsed with PBS after 15 30 minutes of incubation. 200 microliters of rabbit anti alpha l AT is added to each well in the presence of 1t BSA PBS. After 15 minutes incubion, the solution is removed and the wells are rinsed with PBS. A sample of 200 microliters of goat anti rabbit IgG coupled to alkaline phosphatase in 1 BSA and PBS are added to each well and incubated for 15 minutes. After rinsing the wells, 200 microliters of a substrate solution was added which contains 30 milligrams of dinitrophenyl phosphate dissolved in 50 ml of 0.1 m diethanolamine pH 9.6. A yellow color is allowed to develop 15 60 minutes and intensity is recorded at 405 nm on a Titertek Multiscan detector. The yellow color is proportional to the amount of AT in the test solution.
