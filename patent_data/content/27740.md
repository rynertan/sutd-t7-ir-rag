# A method of manufacturing fibrous rod like articles and apparatus for performing such a method.

## Abstract
In the manufacture of a fibrous rod like article for use, particularly as cigarette filters, a tow 2 of cellulose ester fibres is drawn from a bale 1, formed into the required shape and then impregnated with a carboxylic acid ester of a polyol. The impregnated tow 2 is then passed through a microwave irradiating device 10 and simultaneously with, or prior to, passage through the device 10 water is supplied to the tow. The water enhances the absorption of microwave energy by the tow, causing the carboxylic acid ester of the polyol rapidly to disperse and permeate the acetate fibre and hence rapidly complete the stabilization and solidification of the fibrous rod.
