# Stop joint between cables having an extruded insulation and cables having an insulation aided by a dielectric fluid.

## Abstract
A stop joint according to the present invention between extruded insulation cables 20 and oil filled cables 10 and the like has a structure that comprises a through insulator 1 embedding a metal bar 5 interposed between the two cables 10, 20 whose conductors 9, 19 are mechanically and electrically connected to said bar 5 . A monolithic sleeve 23 encircles the connection 18 between the extruded insulation cable 20 and the insulator 1 , while the connection 8 between the insulator 1 and the oil filled cable 20 , covered with a stratified insulation 14 , is enclosed within a metal box 16 filled with the insulating fluid oil of the cable 10 .
