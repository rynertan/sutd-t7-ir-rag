# Process for co nitrating trimethylolethane and diethylene glycol.

## Abstract
Problems encountered with the exothermic decomposi tion of spent acid obtained after co nitrating a mixture of trime thylolethane and diethylene glycol can be avoided, and a stor age stable spent acid can be obtained by employing, during the co nitration, an excess of from 60 to 100 by weight of ni tric acid over that stoichiometrically required.
