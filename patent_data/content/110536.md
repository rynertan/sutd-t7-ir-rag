## Description
SUBSTITUTED ALKENES AND PROCESSES FOR THEIR PREPARATION This invention relates to certain substituted alkenes2 processes for their preparation and their use in the synthesis of fungicidal compounds. According to one aspect of the present invention there are provided substituted alkenes of formula I EMI1.1 in which R is C2 6 alkyl, preferably C2 5 alkyl, X is halogen, C1 5 alkyl e.g. methyl, ethyl, n or iso propyl or n , sec , iso or t butyl , C1 4 alkoxy e.g. methoxy or ethoxy , halo C14 alkyl e.g. trifluoromethyl or 121,2,2 tetrafluoroethyl , halo C1 4 alkoxy e.g. trifluoromethoxy or 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethoxy , nitro, phenyl, phenoxy, benzyl, benzyloxy optionally ring substituted with halogen , alkylenedioxy, haloalkylenedioxy e.g.difluoromethylenedioxy , amino, mono or di C1 4 alkylamino e.g.dimethylamino , hydroxy, morpholino and carboxy and alkyl esters thereof , n is an integer having a value of 1, 2 or 3 and when n is 2 or 3 the substituents represented by X are the same or different. In particular R is C24 alkyl, being selected from ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl, sec butyl, iso butyl, tert butyl and especially n butyl. Examples of theEMI2.1 are o , m or p chlorophenyl, 2,4 or 2,6 dichlorophenyl, o , m or p fluorophenyl, 2,4 or 2,6 difluorophenyl, o , m or p bromophenyl, 2 chloro 4 fluorophenyl, 2 fluoro 4 chlorophenyl, 2 chloro 6 fluoro phenyl, o , m or p methoxyphenyl, 2,4 dimethoxyphenyl, o , m or p ethoxyphenyl, o , m or p nitrophenyl, 2 chloro 4 nitrophenyl, 2 chloro 5 nitrophenyl, o , m or p methylphenyl, 2,4 dimethylphenyl, o , m or p t butylphenyl, o , m or p trifluoromethylphenyl, o , mor p trifluoromethoxyphenyl, o , m or p 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethyl phenyl, 2,3 difluoromethylenedioxy phenyl, 2 fluoro 4 methoxyphenyl 2 methoxy 4 fluorophenyl, 2 methoxy 4 chlorophenyl, 2 methoxy 4 fluaro phenyl, o , m or p phenoxyphenyl, o , m or p phenylphenyl o , m or p biphenylyl , o , m or p benzylphenyl, o , m or p benzyloxyphenyl, o , m or p p chloro or p fluoro benzyloxy phenyl, o , m or p aminophenyl, o , m or p N,N dimethylamino phenyl, o , m or p hydroxyphenyl, o , m or p carboxyphenyl, o , m or p methoxy carbonyl phenyl and o , m or p morpholinophenyl. Preferred substituted alkenes have the formula II EMI2.2 in which Y and Z are independently hydrogen, chloro or fluoro, provided at least one of Y and Z is chloro or fluoro, and R has the meaning stated above. In particular, Y and Z are independently chloro or fluoro and R is C3 or C4 alkyl. An example of a preferred substituted alkene is 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl n hex 1 ene. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the preparation of the compounds of formula I which comprises reacting a compound of formula III EMI3.1 in which R, X and n have the meanings stated above, with methylenetriphenylphosphorane. Methylene triphenylphosphorane is a known reagent for use in the Wittig reaction i.e. the reaction between an alkylidenephosphorane and a carbonyl compound to form a compound containing a C C bond. A method for its preparation is described in the Journal of Organic Chemistry, 1963, 28, p.1128 and outlined by the following reaction scheme.Reaction scheme for the preparation of methylene triphenyl phosphoraneEMI3.2 metnylene triphenylphosphorane Ph is phenyl Preferably the compound of formula III is added as a solution in dimethylsulphoxide to the inethylene triphenylphosphorane which, itself, is obtained by the above method as a solution in dimethyl sulphoxide. The compound of formula III may be obtained byFriedel Crafts reaction between an acyl chloride of formula RCOC1 and a benzene derivative of formula IV EMI4.1 in which R, X and n have the meanings stated above, in the presence of a Lewis acid such as aluminium chloride. In an alternative process, which forms yet another aspect of the present invention, the compounds of formula I are prepared by dehydrating an alcohol of formula V EMI4.2 in which R, X and n have the meanings stated above. Dehydration may be carried out by methods known from the literature for such reactions, for example, by heating the alcohol of formula V in the presence of a catalytic amount of a strong acid such as p toluene sulphonic acid, preferably in the presence of an inert solvent, stirring the alcohol in a mixture of sulphuric and glacial acetic acids or heating it in ref fluxing dimethyl sulphoxide. As well as forming the compound of formula I in this dehydration process, another alkene may also be formed except in the case when R is tertiary alkyl This other alkene has the formula VI EMI5.1 in which RÚ and Rê are independently H or alkyl and are related to R such that R is CHR 1R2. For example, under certain acid conditions, the alcohol 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl n hexan 2 ol dehydrates to a mixture of 30 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl n hex 1 ene and 70 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl n hex 2 ene. The percentage of the hex 1 ene can be increased to 62 and that of the hex 2 ene reduced to 38 by conducting the dehydration in refluxing dimethyl sulphoxide. In a preferred process for dehydrating the alcohol of formula V , which process forms yet another aspect of the present invention, the alcohol of formula V is heated at a temperature of 10000 or above in the presence of an alumina catalyst. Suitably the process is carried out in the liquid phase at a temperature below the boiling point of the alcohol but sufficiently high to enable the dehydration to be completed in an acceptable time. For example, the alcohol 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl n hexan 2 ol, can be dehydrated at a temperature of about 2200C in 4 to 5 hours in the presence of about a fifth of its weight of alumina. Surprisingly, dehydration under these conditions favours more strongly formation of the alkene of formula 11 . For example, 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl n hexan 2 ol is dehydrated to a mixture of the corresponding hex 1 ene and hex 2 ene in the ratio of approximately 82 18. The alcohol of formula V may be obtained by a Grignard reaction between a methyl magnesium halide and a compound of formula III which may be prepared as previously described. The substituted alkenes of formula I are useful intermediates for fungicides of the formula VII EMI6.1 in which R, X and n have the meanings stated above, which are described in, for example, European Patent Specification No.48548 European Application No.81303753.8 and UK Patent SpecificationNo.2064520. Thus the present invention also includes the use of the substituted alkenes in the synthesis of the fungicidal compounds of formula VII by a process which comprises the steps of i reacting an alkene of formula I with chlorine, bromine, hypochlorous acid or hypobromous acid in aqueous medium to give the corresponding halohydrin of formula VIII EMI6.2 in which A is chlorine or bromine and R, X and n have the meanings previously stated and ii reacting the halohydrin so formed with 1,2,4 triazole in the presence of an acid binding agent or with an alkali metal salt of the triazole, conveniently in a solvent such as dimethylformamide. Step ii is thought to proceed via the epoxide of formula IX EMI7.1 which is readily formed from the halohydrin under the basic conditions of the triazole addition. Alternatively, the fungicidal compounds of formula VII are prepared by a process which comprises the steps of a forming directly the epoxide of formula IX by the electrochemical epoxidation of the alkene of formula I by a process such as that described in European Application No.83302141.3 Publication No.0093526 which comprises electrolysing the alkene in a medium comprising a water miscible solvent and aqueous solution of a halogen salt and b reacting the epoxide so formed with 1,2,4 triazole in the presence of an acid binding agent or with an alkali metal salt of the triazole conveniently in a solvent such as dimethylformamide. The invention is illustrated by the following Example in which parts and percentages are by weight.Example 1 a 2 2,4 Dichlorophenyl n hex l ene A solution of 2,4 dichlorovalerophenone 18.Z parts in dimethylsulphoxide 22 parts was added to the solution of methylenetriphenylphosphorane 27.6 parts prepared as described inJ.Org.Chem. 1963, 28, p.1128. After stirring overnight at ambient temperature, the amber solution was heated to 700C for one hour, and then cooled to 100C.
