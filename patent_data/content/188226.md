# Concealed wiper system.

## Abstract
A concealed wiper system comprises a wiper motor 1 having a mechanism to house a wiper arm in a retracted stop position by means of the reverse rotation of the wiper motor a wiper actuation switch 3 with output capability which consists of a two bit selection signal output from the selected switch position a wiper motor position detector 2 which detects data on wiper motor output shaft position, said detector output capability consisting of a two bit position signal determined by the position of said output shaft a control means 4 consisting of a microcomputer which operates based upon said selection signals and position signals, said microcomputer also outputs both normal and reverse rotation signals and a wiper motor drive circuit 6 which actuates said wiper motor in both normal and reverse rotation by means of signals from said control means.
