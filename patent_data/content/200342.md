# EVALUATION OF SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE CHARACTERISTICS OF A SAMPLE

## Abstract
A method and apparatus is disclosed for evaluating surface and subsurface features in a sample by detecting scattering of a probe beam 42 from an area of a sample 22 in which thermal and or plasma waves are generated by a periodic excitation source such as an intensity modulated 34 pump laser beam 32 for supplying energy to the surface of the sample. The probe beam 42 from a probe laser 40 is directed to the surface of the sample within the area that is being periodically excited and in a manner such that the probe beam is scattered from the excited area. Variations of the intensity of the scattered probe beam are detected by a photon detector 50 and its output signal is processed to evaluate surface and subsurface characteristics of the sample.
