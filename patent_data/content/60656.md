# Gaseous fuel and air metering device for an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A device 10, 12 to meter and control the flow of a gase ous fuel and air to an internal combustion engine. The portion of the device which controls the flow of gaseous fuel com prises a reservoir chamber 16 linked to a pressurised fuel supply, a plurality of individual chambers 20 equal in number to the number of engine cylinders, demand valves 24 con nected to the individual chambers which permit fuel to flow on the intake stroke of each cylinder and valves 18 biased to a closed position between each individual chamber 20 and the reservoir 16 for controlling the flow of gaseous fuel to the in dividual chambers and a connection 32, 28 for linking the valves to the throttle of the engine to open the valves simul taneously. The portion 12 of the device for controlling air flow to the engine cylinders comprises an air control 38 connect ed to the engine throttle and to the fuel control portion 10 of the device to regulate entry of the air to the engine manifold, and one way air valves 112 associated with each cylinder to allow air to enter the cylinder on the intake stroke of the cylin der.
