# Articulated toy.

## Abstract
A figure toy 10 which includes a unique actuating mechanism 60 which cooperates with a novel shoulder assembly 22 which allows the toy 10 to emulate a shrug or a wave and to perform other functions of the same sort in a very realistic manner. The shoulder assembly 22 includes a member which pivots about one end 52 when it receives pressure from the actuating mechanism 60 . The other end of the assembly 22 is attached to an arm 16 . Thus, the motion of the shoulder assembly 22 moves the shoulder upwardly and inwardly simulating very closely the raising of the human shoulder such as occurs during a shrug or a wave. The arrangement allows one or the other or both of the shoulders together to be raised.
