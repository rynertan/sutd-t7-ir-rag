Each of the sides provides a desired storage accessory such as a beverage container receptacle or a coin storage device 74 . One side 38 of the turntable is a plain planar surface 64 which merely closes the opening 30 . The console 10 has a rectangular opening 26 and the turntable is rotatably mounted within the opening by axles 46,48 which extend from the polygonal ends of the prism turntable and are rotatably journaled in bearing blocks 50,60 attached to the console housing 22 so that rotary movement of the prism turntable sequentially registers a desired one of the storage accessories with the console opening for access by the vehicle occupant. A round thumb wheel 88 is attached to the prism turntable and extends above the surface 24 of the console to provide a convenient means by which the turntable can be rotated. A detent is provided to retain the turntable at the selected position. The detent preferably includes a spring loaded button carried by the housing and riding against the end face of the thumb wheel to extend within one of a plurality of circumferentially spaced conical depressions 102 to hold the turntable at a selected position.
