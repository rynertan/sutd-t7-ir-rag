# Two stage commutation circuit for an inverter.

## Abstract
A two stage commutation circuit for an inverter, each having a different energy storage capability, commutates the main semiconductor switches 14, 16 by creating a commu tation pulse suitable for the different levels of load current. This improves overall inverter efficiency by decresing the circulating commutation current at light loads due to reduced size of the commutation and makeup pulses utilized at the lower load current levels. The control circuit for the dual commutation circuits includes a voltage detector 72 for sensing the level of the DC input voltage and current detectors 76, 80 for sensing the times at which the load current is essentially zero so that the transistion between the commutation circuits 36, 38 will occur without perturba tions in the cyclic operation of the inverter.
