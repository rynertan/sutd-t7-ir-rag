# Lift brake control method and apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention controls the braking of a lift 35 , stopping it exactly at a selected floor stop level 23 independently of initial speed 34 and load conditions, optimizing travel time and security. Braking is activated at a preestablished distance 34 from the floor level 23 when the lift cabin 35 trips a reference sensor 39, 41 . From there on, the real time speed V of the lift is compared with a theoretical value to generate a signal controlling the braking power of the reversed driver motor 47 . The theoretical value is determined exclusively from a preset table 45 on the basis of the remaining distance D to the floor level 23 , unlike some prior art system which use time for the control variable. The remaining distance D and real time speed data V are obtained from a single trans ducer consisting of a perforated disc 55 coupled to the motor 46 shaft and a optoelectronic circuit 59 which emits a pulse for each unitary distance D travelled by the lift 35 .
