## Description
Electrode for cardiac stimulators This invention refers to an electrode for cardiac stimulators pacemaker , particularly suited for atrial applications.Electrodes are known with a helical tip formed by a loop of metallic wire loosely twisted on itself so as to form helical congruent turns merging into each other at the free end of the tip. Such electrodes have the advantage of a screwed anchorage within the trabeculae of the cardiac wall with the consequent stability of the electrode. A further advantage seems to consist in the lowering of the threshold of stimulation.The object of this invention is to provide an electrode with improved helical tip, which would be practically not thrombogenic particularly at the free end , would produce only an insignificant trauma in the endocardiac surface and in any case would not damage the myocardium.A further object is to obtain a particularly low stimulation threshold and a high sensitivity to the impulses coming from the cardiac wall.According to the invention, the helical tip of the electrode is formed by a metal strip with rounded longitudinal and terminal edges, helically twisted about its longitudinal axis. Also the free end of the strip has a rounded shape. Preferably, the tip has a total of from 1 to 3 torsion turns. Advantageously, the length of the tip is of the order of 5 7 mm, the width of the strip is of the order of 1.0 to 1.5 and its thickness is of the order of 0.2 to 0.3 mm.According to a preferred embodiment, the strip is constituted by a platinum iridium alloy preferably with Pt Ir 90 10 and is coated with a thin layer of platinum sponge, so that the whole useful surface of the helical tip is porous preferably with pores of the diameter of about 40 microns. Such coating can easily be obtained by electrolytic deposition forming a porous deposit, and by a subsequent thermal treatment of sintering according to a process forming the subject matter of Applicant s separate application Case E041 FJ filed on the same date and having the title Electrode for cardiac stimulators and process for its manufacture .An electrode according to the invention is illustrated by way of example in the appended drawings, in which Fig. 1 is an axial cross sectional view of the terminal part of an endocardiac probe comprising the involved electrode and Fig. 2 is a transverse cross sectional view on line Il Il of Fig. 1.In the illustrated embodiment, the electrode comprises a body 1 in the form of a cylindrical cap and a helical tip 2, both of platinum iridium .90 10. The cap shaped body 1 is inserted into the end of a silicone rubber sheath 3 containing an electrical conductor 4 in form of helical spiral, which can be monofilament but preferably is composed of three filaments for reliability reasons, according to the known art. The spiral 4 penetrates into the cap shaped body 1, which is crimped on a length of the spiral containing a small metallic cylinder 5 acting as anvil or mandrel against crushing of the spiral during crimping.The helical tip 2 is formed by a strip 6 of Pt Ir 90 10, which can be integral with the body 1 or fitted to the latter by welding. The longitudinal and terminal edges 6 of the strip 6 are rounded, as is shown in Fig. 2.The width D of the strip 6 is equal to the diameter of the body 1 and amounts to about 1.2 mm. Its thicknessS is about 0.25 mm. The free end 6 of the strip is rounded and the strip is twisted on its longitudinal axis X for a total of about 1.2 turns. The length L of the resulting helical tip is of 6 7 mm. The tip is entirely coated with a porous layer 7 of platinum, of a thickness of a few hundredths of millimeter.According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, while the whole helical tip serves for anchoring in the cardiac wall, only a limited segment of its length is freely exposed and 1coated with a porous layer, while the remaining part of the tip is coated by an electrical ly insulating pellicular layer, so as to obtain on said segment the desired current density. Such segment is preferably an intermediate segment, as for example the half turn denoted by L in Fig. 1. The pellicular insulating layer may have a thickness of only a few microns and can be obtained by means of a silicone rubber paint. However, the most suited material is that known under the trade name PARYLENE, which desi.gn ates polymers based on paraxylylene forming thermoplastic films by polymerisation from vapour phase on the surface to be coated, kept cold. The most suited type of Parylene seems to be the poly monochloro p xylylene, but also the ordinary poly p xylylene can be employed with success. During the deposition from vapour phase, the segment of the helical tip as that L in Fig. 1 which has to remain uncoated is kept protected by means of a suitable temporary resist layer, constituted for example by an ordinary self adhesive tape.
