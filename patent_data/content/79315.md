## Description
Machine for loading and unloading cylindrical bales of hay and the like The present invention relates to machines for loading and unloading cylindrical bales of hay and the like, of the type comprising a wheeled vehicle with a frame bearing a load carrying platform which can be tilted between a lowered position for receiving a row of bales and a raised position for unloading the bales, loading means for picking up the bales from the ground and loading them onto one end of the platform, a pusher located at the said end of the platform and movable parallel to the latter so as to push the bales towards the other end of the platform , and means for controlling the loading means, the pusher, and the tilting platform. The object of this invention is to provide a machine of the aforesaid type which has a simpler and more economical form than conventional machines, and is such as to allow, in particular, the easy and safe lifting of the cylindrical bales from the ground, in the same direction as they have been deposited by a baling machine, and an equally easy and safe placing of the bales on the tilting platform. According to the invention, this object is achieved by virtue of the fact that the loading means comprise a gripper having a yoke and two arms which can be opened out,Which is arranged laterally of the platform and is rotatable about a first axis transverse the platform and about a second axis perpendicular to the first axis, and that the means for controlling the loading means include an actuator for effecting the angular displacement of the gripper about the first axis between a lowered pick up position in which the arms of the gripper extend substantially parallel to the platform, and a raised position in which the arms are substantially perpendicular to the platform, and means for controlling the simultaneous rotation of the gripper about the second axis between a receiving position corresponding to the said lowered position, in which the yoke of the gripper is transverse the platform, and a depositing position corresponding to the said raised position, in which the yoke of the gripper issubstantially parallel to the platform. By virtue of this characteristic, a single moving member, that is, the gripper with arms which can be opened out, is able to grip and lift the bales, placing them in the right position for their subsequent depositing on the platform. Thus, in addition to a perceptible simplification of the machine from the aspect of construction and maintenance, there are considerable advantages linked to the speed and facility with which the bales are picked up and placed on the platform. Further characteristics and advantages of the inventor will become apparent from the following detailed description, supplied purely by way of non restrictive example with reference to the appended drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic plan view which illustrates a machine according to the invention during use Figure 2 is a diagrammatic perspective view, of the machine on an enlarged scale Figure 3 is a partial cross sectional view taken along the line Ill Ill of Figure 2 Figures 4 and 5 are two perspective views which show a detail of the machine on an enlarged scale in two different operating positions Figure 6 is a perspective view from below of the detail shown in Figures 4 and 5 Figure 7 is a perspective view of a variant of the machine Figure 8 is a side elevational view of a part ofFigure 7 in a different operating condition, and Figure 9 is a perspective view of a detail ofFigures 7 and 8 in an intermediate operating condition. In Figure 1 there is generally indicated 10 a machine in the form of. a wheeled trailer for towing by a tractor 12, which is arranged for the loading, in a field,of cylindrical bales 14 of straw or hay made by conventional baling apparatus and laid on the ground in rows. As shown in Figure 1, the trailer 10 towed by the tractor 12 proceeds in the direction of the arrow F parallel to, and laterally of, the rows of bales 14 in such manner as to pick up the bales and transfer them to a storage area where they will be unloaded to form stacks, as described below. Referring now in greater detail to Figures 2 and 3, the trailer 10 comprises an elongate metal frame 16 which is formed from tubular main members 18 connected by cross members 20. The frame 16 is connected underneath to a pair of axles 22 bearing wheels 24 at their ends.As can be better seen in Figure 3, the gauge of the front wheels 24 is greater than that of the rear wheels. The frame 16 is provided at its front end with an attachment member 26 which serves for its connection to a towing member not shown of the tractor 12 in a known manner, and with a hydraulic pump indicated diagrairrtiati cally 28, which is included in a hydraulic control circuit and is arranged so as to be activated by the power take off of the tractor 12 in a known manner. The hydraulic control circuit, which will be described in detail further on, comprises a distributor unit 30 which is operable by levers 32 and is carried by a telescopic arm 34 of adjustable inclination connected to the front end of the frame 16. It is clear that the levers 32 are conveniently accessible to the driver of the tractor 12. The frame 16 supports at the top a tiltingloadcarrying platform, generally indicated 36. As can be better seen in Figure 3, the structure of the load carrying platform 36 comprises three tubular longitudinal members 38 which extend from the rear end of the trailer 10 to a certain distance from the front end. The longitudinal members 38 are connected by a series of cross members 40 and by a curved plate 42 with a curvature corresponding substantially to that of the bales 14.Into the front ends of the three longitudinal members are slidably engaged three longitudinal members 44 connected by an end cross member 46 to which are attached two vertical push rods 48. The longitudinal members 44, with the cross member 46 and the rods 48, constitute a pusher 50 which can be moved towards and away from the curved plate 42, in the manner described below, by using a hydraulic jack 90 housed within the central longitudinal member 38, the functioning of which is controlled by the distribution unit 30. It should be pointed out that in the withdrawn position of the pusher 50 shown in Figure 2, that is , in the condition of maximum length of the platform 36, the distance of the push rods 48 from the front end of the curved plate 42 is generally greater than the axial dimension of the bales 14. The tilting platform 36 is articulated to the frame 16 at the rear about a transverse axis 52, so that it can rotate between a lowered receiving position shown in Figures 2 and 3, in which it is parallel to the frame 16, and a raised depositing position in which it extends upwardly perpendicular to the frame 16. The angular displacement of the platform 36 is controlled by a pair of hydraulic jacks, diagrammatically indicated 54 in Figure 3,which are also controlled by the distributor unit 30. Opposite the pusher 50, the platform 36 is provided with a pair of vertical stop rods 56 carried by the two lateral longitudinal members 38. A loading arm, generally indicated 60 , is connected laterally to the frame 16 in the region of the pusher 50. As shown in greater detail in Figures 4 to 6, the loading arm 60 is formed by a U shaped gripper comprising an extendible yoke 62 of the telescopic type and two gripping arms 64 directed perpendicular to the yoke 62 and having free ends 64a which diverge from each other. The yoke 62 has a lateral projection 66 articulated to a rotating support 68 about an axis A lying in a vertical plane parallel to the longitudinal axis of the trailer 10. The support 68 is articulated, in its turn, to the corresponding main member 18 of the frame 16 about an axis B transverse the longitudinal axis of the trailer 10 and hence perpendicular to the axis A. The projection 66 of the yoke 62 is connected to the frame 16 by an adjustable tie rod 70 which has one end 72 articulated to the projection 66 and its opposite end articulated to a coupling 74 fixed below the main member 18 in a position spaced from the support 68 and displaced towards the front end of the trailer 10. A hydraulic jack 76 is located adjacent the main member 18 and has one end articulated to a coupling 78 fixed to the support 68, and its opposite end articulated to a coupling 80 fixed to the main member 18 in front of the coupling 74 of the tie rod 70. The jack 76 is connected to the hydraulic circuit of the trailer 10 and is thus controlled by the distributor unit 30. When the jack 76 is in its contracted position Figures 4 and 6 , the gripper 60 is in a lowered position in which it extends parallel to the platform 36, with yoke 62 directed transversely of the platform 36 and the two arms 64 horizontal. On the other hand, when the jack 76 is in its extended position Figure 5 , the gripper 60 is in a raised position in which it extends perpendicular to the platform 36, with the yoke 62 parallel to the platform 36 and the two arms 64 vertical. It can easily be understood that the change over from the lowered to the raised position, and vice versa, is effected by a simple operation of the jack 76 which causes a 900 rotation of the support 68, and hence the gripper 60 , about the axis B, while a 900 rotation of the gripper 60 about the axis A occurs at the same time due to the presence of the tie rod 70. It should be pointed out that the tie rod 70 could be replaced by a functionally equivalent device, such as, for example, a second hydraulic jack or a pair of gears arranged so as to effect a rotation of the gripper 60 about the axis A at the same time as Aits rotation about the axis B. The solution described above should be considered as the preferred one, however, for reasons of simplicity and economy in its realisation. By virtue of the telescopic form of the yoke 62, the two arms 64 of the gripper 60 can be moved relative to each other between a closed, drawn together position shown by a solid line in Figures 4 and 5 and an open, spaced apart position shown by a broken line in the saidFigures. The movement is ef ected by a hydraulic jack, diagrammatically indicated 82 in Figure 4, which is housed within the yoke 72 and the functioning of which is controlled by the distributor unit 30. Clearly the telescopic structure of the yoke 62 also permits the width of the gripper 60 to be adjusted to the dimensions of the bales 14. On to the yoke 62 there is fitted a rocking retain ing board 84 which is subject to the action of resilient means not shown which tend to resist its movement towards the outside of the gripper 60. It will be clear from what has gone before, that in use of the machine described above, the gripper 60 is able to pick up the bales 14 from the ground and place them directly on to the load carrying platform 36.In fact, when the tractor 12 is being driven towards a bale 14 which is to be picked up, the gripper 60 is kept in the lowered position, as in Figures 2, 4 and 6, with the arms 64 in the open position. When the bale 14 is introduced between the two arms 64, abutting the board 84, the jack 82 is actuated in such a manner as to cause the closure of the arms 64 and then the jack 76 is extended whereby the bale 14 gripped between the two arms 64 is raised and, at the same time, rotated so that it is arranged with its axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the trailer 10. During this operation, the board 84 prevents the bale 14 from slipping and accidentally becoming released from the gripper 60. As soon as the gripper 60 reaches its raised position shown in Figure 5, the two arms 64 are opened by the jack 82, thus allowing the bale 14 to be deposited on the pulley platform 36 in the region of the pusher 50. In order to ensure the correct positioning of the bale 14, the frame 16 may, with advantage, be provided with inclined lateral guide slides 86 in this zone. At this point, the gripper 60 is returned to its lowered position, while the jack 90 is activated 6 as to move the pusher 50 towards the curved plate 42, pushing the bale 14 thereon towards the rear end of the platform 36. These operations are repeated until the platform 36 is filled, that is, until there is a complete row of bales 14 in the region between the rear retaining rods 56 and the push rods 48 of the pusher 50. Once loading is complete, the trailer 10 is taken to the collection and storage area where the row of bales 14 is unloaded by tilting the platform 36 from the horizontal position shown in the drawings to the vertical position for depositing the bales, by the operation of the two jacks 54. It should be pointed out that the working length of the load carrying platform 36 can be reduced according to the requirements of use simply by moving the push rods 48 of the pusher 50 closer to the curved plate 42. Advantageously, this allows the trailer 10 to be adapted to the most varied requirements of use. The variant of the machine shown in Figures 7 to 9 is , in general, similar to the embodiment described above, and only the differences will be described in detail using the same reference numerals for identical or similar parts. In this variant, instead of three tubular longitudinal members 38, the platform 36 comprises a single central tubular longitudinal member 88 which carries the curved plate 42 and contains the jack 90 for operating the pusher 50. In this turn, this pusher 50 comprises a single main member 92 which is slidably mounted in the front end of the longitudinal member 88, and a pusher plate 94. In the region of the platform 36 across which the pusher 50 moves, there is provided a cradle 96 with a curvature corresponding to that of the curved plate 42, which is fixed to the frame 16 and has a longitudinal groove 98 at its centre for passage of the pusher plate 94. In this case, the yoke 62 of the gripper 60 is inextensible and the movable arm 64 of the gripper 60 is able to swing relative to the yoke 62. In this case, in fact, the arm 64 is articulated at 100 to the end of the yoke 62 opposite the other arm 64, and a hydraulic jack 102 is provided to effect the angular movement of the movable arm 64 between the closed position of the gripper 60, in which the movable arm 64 is parallel to the other arm 64, and the open position in which the movable arm 64 diverges outwardly. Naturally, the jack 102 is controlled from the distributor unit 30. It should be pointed out that the fixed arm 64 can be fitted to the yoke 62 in at least two different positions, shown by a solid line and a broken line inFigure 8, for the purpose of varying the width of the gripper 60 according to the sizes of the bales 14. In this case, the connection of the gripper 60 to the frame 16 is practically identical to that described above. In this case, however, the jack 76 extends towards the rear end of the platform 36 on the inside of the frame 16 and hence in a more protected position. Finally, in this variant, a hydraulic stabiliser is provided, which is fixed to the frame 16 in front of the gripper 60 and is connected to the hydraulic circuit of the trailer 10. The stabiliser 104 includes a bearing foot 106 which is movable vertically for lowering during the stage of loading the bales 14 onto the platform 36, so as to stabilise the trailer 10 during this operation. The operation of the machine according to this variant is exactly the same as that described above and, in this case, also the gripper 60 undergoes two simultaneous rotations of 900 about the axes A and B respectively, during loading of the bales 14. Figures 7 and 8 show the gripper 60 in its lowered and raised positions respectively, while Figure 9 shows the gripper 60 in an intermediate position during its rotation. Naturally, it is possible to foresee numerous variations to the construction of the machine according to the invention, without nevertheless going beyond the spirit of the following claims.
