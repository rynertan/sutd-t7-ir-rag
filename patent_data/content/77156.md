## Abstract
An incident light image is projected onto a CCD device through a color filter array 32 . The color filter array 32 is pro vided with a color filter row n with the same construction as that of a color filler row n corresponding to an nth horizontal scanning for interlacing purposes, which is disposed between the color filter row n and a n 1 th color filter row corre sponding to a n 1 th horizontal scanning. The color filter blocks forming the color filter rows n and n 1 are disposed and shifted by the half of a length L of each block extending in the horizontal scanning direction. All of the color filter rows forming the color filter array 32 each have an arrangement of color filter blocks with two different color transmission charac teristics alternately arranged.
