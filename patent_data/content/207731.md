# Hybrid non transferred arc plasma torch system and method of operating same.

## Abstract
A hybrid non transferred arc plasma torch system 2 utilizes an arc plasma torch 4 wose hollow body 10 carries internally a cathode 11 aligned with a relatively small diameter nozzle 12 which functions under a created arc to issue and arc flame 19 through the nozzle 12 with a plasma gas 32 applied to the chamber 14 of the hollow body 10 . An external anode 30 electrically isolated from the cathode 11 and the transferred arc plasma torch body 10 coaxial with the nozzle 12 and spaced downstream thereof has an active anode surface 47 of relatively large area radially remote from the axis of the arc flame 19 issuing from the transferred arc torch with the external anode positioned such that the arc flame 19 extends freely beyond the active anode surface 47 with a reverse flow of electrons 46 completing the circuit from the arc flame 19 beyond the anode surface back to that anode surface 47 . The external anode 30 is of cup shaped configuration extending axially beyond the torch hollow body 10 to define a secondary gas chamber 42 about the arc flame 19 exiting from the torch body nozzle 12 to constrict the arc 19 as it exits from the exterior anode passage 43 and that arc portion which freely extends beyond the active exterior anode surface 47 .
