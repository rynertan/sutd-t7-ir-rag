# APPARATUS FOR TRANSFERRING ARTICLES INTO PRODUCT BUCKETS OF A CARTONER

## Abstract
This invention is directed to an apparatus for transferring packages into the product buckets of a cartoning machine which comprises an infeed conveyor for advancing the pack ages having a curved surface at its discharge end, and a transfer mechanism for moving the articles from the infeed conveyor to the deadplate. The transfer mechanism includes an endless support carrying transverse projections which move into the gap between contiguous packages to separate each package at the discharge end of the infeed conveyor from the adjacent upstream packages. The transverse projec tions form a compartment for each package which positively controls the movement of the packages from the infeed con veyor to the product buckets at a precise speed timed to the speed of the product buckets.
