The products of Formula I can be produced by the methods depicted in the following ReactionSchemes wherein R, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5,R6, R7, R8, R9, n, p, q, r, A, B, U, V, W, X,Y and Z are as defined above. Reactive functionality in these groups is protected as needed with suitable protecting groups as is well known to those skilled in peptide chemistry. In general, the compounds of this invention can be prepared by reacting a compound having the formula EMI13.1 wherein R, R1, R2, R7, A, B and n are as defined above, with a carboxy activated derivative of a compound having the formula EMI13.2 wherein R3 and R4 are as defined above and Q is a suitable protecting group such as t butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, and like groups. Activation of the carboxy derivative III is typically accomplished with N hydroxysuccinimide or N hydroxybenzotriazole esters. Subsequent removal of the Q protecting group using standard conditions yield compounds of FormulaI. Amino acid derivative III can also be coupled to dipeptide derivative II using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or diphenylphosphorylazide providing neither R nor R7 are hydrogen.When either R or R7 are hydrogen in products ofFormula I, the carboxyls in intermediate compounds II should be protected as removable esters such as, for example, with R and or R7 benzyl or t butyl groups. In the above described synthesis, only slightly more than one equivalent of activated amino acid derivative III is used to minimize reaction with the NH of intermediate II to which R1CHCO2R is attached. Alternatively, this NH can be protected during this step with a removable group such as, for example, a formyl function. Additionally, compounds of Formula I can be synthesized in a step wise manner as illustrated in the following Reaction Schemes.REACTION SCHEME IEMI14.1 REACTION SCHEME IIEMI15.1 REACTION SCHEME IIIEMI15.2 In Reaction Scheme I, Z and Q are suitable removable nitrogen protecting groups such as t butoxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl functions andR10 is a removable carboxyl protecting group such as benzyl or t butyl. The addition and removal of these protecting groups is achieved under standard conditions. Similarly, the peptide coupling reactions of intermediates III with IV and V with VI are conducted with coupling reagents standard in peptide chemistry, some of which are noted above while others are illustrated in the Examples set forth hereinbelow. The reductive coupling of R1COCO2R to intermediate VII Z H is achieved by the use of sodium cyanoborohydride or with hydrogen in the presence of catalysts such as palladium or Raney nickel. In Reaction Scheme II, dipeptide VIII results from the coupling of intermediates IX and VI in which protecting. group J is subsequently removed in the presence of protecting group Z. IntermediateIII is then coupled to intermediate VIII in the same manner as described for the synthesis of V from the coupling of III with IV in Reaction Scheme I. Reaction Scheme III illustrates a further synthetic variant wherein the order of the coupling reactions is changed so that properly protected XI is coupled to intermediate VI to yield products ofFormula I. In this coupling reaction, neither R nor o is hydrogen, but either may subsequently be converted to hydrogen by standard methods, if this is desired. Formula I compounds wherein R2 loweralkyl can be prepared by reacting intermediates II, IV and VIII R2 H with aldehydes 1 molar equivalent in the presence of NaCNBH3, or stepwise by first forming the N benzyl derivative using 1 equivalent of benzaldehyde and NaCNBH3, followed by treatment with formaldehyde or loweralkylaldehyde with NaCNBH3, and finally removing the benzyl protecting groups by hydrogenolysis using Pd C catalyst. The above described syntheses can utilize racemates, enantiomers or diastereomers as starting materials or as intermediates. When diastereomeric products result from the synthetic procedures, the diastereomeric products can be separated by conventional chromatographic or fractional crystallization methods. In products of general Formula I, the carbon atoms to which the group, CH2 nNR2COCR3R4 CH2 rNRsH, is attached is asymmetric as are the carbons to whichR1, R3, R4 and B are attached when these groups are not hydrogen. In general, L amino acid configurations are preferred throughout. However, at the carbons to which R3, R4 and B are attached,D amino acid configurations are sometimes consistent with good activity and confer additional metabolic stability. In most instances, L amino acid configurations can be alternatively designated as S and D amino acid configurations as R configurations. The compounds of this invention form salts with various inorganic and organic acids and bases which are also within the scope of the invention.Such salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts like sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts like the calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases e.g., dicyclohexylamine salts,N methyl D glucamine, salts with amino acids like arginine, lysine and the like. Also salts with organic and inorganic acids may be prepared, e.g., HC1, HBr, H2SO4, H3P04, methanesulfonic, toluensulfonic, maleic, fumaric, camphorsulfonic acid.The non toxic physiologically acceptable salts are preferred, although other salts are also useful, e.g., in isolating or purifying the product The salts may be formed by conventional means as by reacting the free acid or free base forms of the product with one or more equivalents of the appropriate base or acid in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble, or in a solvent such as water which is then removed in vacuo or by freezedrying or by exchanging the cations of an existing salt for another cation on a suitable ion exchange resin. The compounds of this invention inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme and thus block conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent pressor substance. Thus, blood pressure lowering can result from inhibition of its biosynthesis especially in animals and humans whose hypertension is angiotensinII related. Furthermore, converting enzyme degrades the vasodepressor substance, bradykinin. Therefore, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme may lower blood pressure also by potentiation of bradykinin.Although the relative importance of these and other possible mechanisms remains to be established, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme are effective antihypertensive agents in a variety of animal models and are useful clinically, for example, in many human patients with renovascular, malignant and essential hypertension and in the treatment of congestive heart failure. See, for example,D.W. Cushman et al., Biochemistry 16, 5484 1977 . The evaluation of converting enzyme inhibitors is guided by in vitro enzyme inhibition assays. For example, a useful method is that ofY. Piquilloud, A Reinharz and M. Roth, Biochem. Biophys. Acta, 206 , 136 1970 in which the hydrolysis of carbobenzyloxyphenylalanylhistidin ylleucine is measured. In vivo evaluations may be made, for example, in normotensive.rats challenged with angiotensin I by the technique of J.R. Weeks andJ.A. Jones, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 104, 646 1960 or in a high renin rat model such as that ofS. Koletsky et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.
