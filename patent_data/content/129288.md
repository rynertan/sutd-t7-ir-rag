# Low pressure sodium vapour discharge lamp.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a low pressure sodium vapour discharge lamp provided with a discharge tube 1 . An electri cal lead through conductor 10a passed through the wall of the discharge tube to an internal electrode 5 is enveloped by a protective glass. According to the invention, the protective glass is con structed as a double bead 12, 13 whose part 12 facing the electrode 5 consists of borate glass and further has a smaller thickness than a second part 13 consisting of lime glass. The lead through construction thus obtained has a high resistance to the sodium in the discharge tube 1 and also to mechanical forces.
