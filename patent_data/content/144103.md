## Description
The present application is a divisional application derived from our copending application No. 81302685.3 filed on 16th June, 1981, claiming priority from United States application No. 160 241 filed on 17th June, 1980. The present invention relates to a method for preparing useful peptides, and more particularly to a solution synthesis method for preparing H ARG X Z Y TYR R and to compositions useful therein. In United Stated Patent 4,190,646 and European Patent Application No. 80301170.9 Publication No. 0018182 there are disclosed various peptides which are useful in thymic function and immunological areas. The patent discloses the thymopoietin pentapeptide TP5 and substituted derivatives thereof, while the application discloses peptide analogs of TP5 which have greater potency than TP5. In the referenced patent and application, the peptides were prepared by solid phase synthesis techniques commonly described as Merrifield Synthesis. The patent and application also disclose that classical techniques i.e. solution synthetic techniques may be employed to prepare certain of these materials, but no specific classical method or synthetic route was disclosed. In Chemische Berichte, Vol. US A 3 997 516 Nishimura relates to a process for protecting a guanidino group in a amino acid or a peptide with a lower alkoxybenzenesulfonyl or tri lower alkyl benzenesulfonyl group. It discloses a number of protected amino acids and peptides. DE A 2 544 348 Max Planck relates to a process for the preparation of L leucine 13 motilin, and discloses a number of protected amino acids and peptides used in the process. While the solid phase synthetic technique of Merrifield is a convenient one for preparation of small quantities of peptides in the laboratory, it would be impractical and generally uneconomic for preparation of large quantities e.g. more than about 100 grams of peptide, for which solution synthetic techniques are more appropriate. Moreover, solution synthesis techniques are generally much less costly than solid phase techniques due to the much lesser unit cost of certain of the reagents used. Among the large variety of solution synthetic techniques available for use in polypeptide preparation, Applicants have discovered particular synthetic methods which produce the desired peptide conveniently and economically. The present invention relates to methods for preparation of H ARG X Z Y TYR R The method of the present invention comprises the steps of When compared to the method disclosed in the above referenced copending application, this method avoids the necessity of removing L arginine impurity from the final product, which is a difficult and sometimes impossible task. Fragment IV may be formed by the steps of Fragement V may be formed by the steps of Of course, if X is LYS, then its epsilon amino group must also be suitably protected by the amino protecting group T during the preparation of Fragments containing X and their use to prepare the end product peptide. The T group must be readily removable under conditions which will not destroy the resulting peptide, while being stable during the removal of the T groups. The alpha amino protective group T may be the same or different for each amino acid above and should be stable to removal by the steps employed for joining the amino acid groups while still being readily removable at the end of the connecting steps by conditions which will not cleave any of the amide bonds of the peptide. For some groups e.g., BOC this removal is caused by strong acid e.g., trifluoracetic acid , which result in the deprotected intermediate being obtained as the corresponding acid addition salt e.g., trifluoroacetate . The guanidino protective group T may be any suitable amino protecting group as described below, or a nitro group as well as acid addition salts such as the hydrochloride. Of the amino protecting groups, urethane protecting groups formula a below and substituted sulfonic acid derivatives such as p methoxybenzenesulfonyl and tosyl are preferred. The hydrochloride salt is most preferred. This guanidino protective group is referred to herein as omega group to indicate that it is at the end of the chain. The exact location of many guanidino protective groups on the chain is not definitely known. The carboxy protective group U should be readily removable under conditions which will not destroy the resulting peptide, while being stable during the removal of the T groups. The R group is either NH₂ for product peptides where R is NH₂ or OU for product peptides where R is OH . Exemplary of suitable amino protecting groups are those of formula Amino protecting group f , which is bidentate, may be used only for the alpha amino groups of L arginine or L valine or the alpha amino and epsilon amino groups of L lysine but not for the alpha amino group of sarcosine. The amino protecting group on the sarcosine alpha amino group must be monodentate due to the methyl substituent on that amino group. The remaining amino protecting groups may be used for all amino acids. As used herein, halo includes fluoro,chloro, bromo, and iodo, but chloro and bromo are preferred. The terms loweralkoxy include, respectively, saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons of one to six carbons such as methyl, ethyl isopropyl, t butyl, n hexyl, and the like and the corresponding alkoxies such as methoxy, ethoxy, isopropoxy, t butoxy, n hexoxy, and the like. Methyl is the preferred loweralkyl and methoxy is the preferred loweralkoxy. The reagents employed to introduce these protecting groups usually the corresponding acid chlorides, although other derivatives may be used are sometimes referred to herein as protecting group reagents . Other suitable protective groups are disclosed in, for example, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry , J.F.W., McOmie, ed., Plenum Press, N.Y. 1973. It is preferred that each T and T be the same and be benzyloxycarbonyl CBZ or trifluoroacetyl TFA . It is preferred that T be the hydrochloride salt. A variety of reagents may be employed for producing the carboxy activated protected amino acid residues described above. One type of carboxy activated protected amino acid residue is a reactive ester. Exemplary of agents used to prepare the suitable active esters are phenol phenol wherein the phenyl ring is substituted with one to five members selected from halo e.g., chloro or fluoro , nitro, cyano, and methoxy thiophenyl N hydroxyphthalimide N hydroxysuccinimide N hydroxyglutarimide N hydroxybenzamide 1 hydroxybenzotriazole and the like. Other suitable agents are disclosed in, for example, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry , J.F.W. McOmie, ed referred to above. The specific examples provided below generally employ N hydroxysuccinimide or 1 hydroxybenzotriazole. Other activation methods, such as the mixed or symmetrical anhydride method, the acid chloride method, and the azide method, are well known in the art, being described in, e.g. Bodanszky, For convenience, the following abbreviations are employed herein to refer to the various amino acids In the above figure the protective groups are represented by U,T and T as discussed above, while the carboxy activation of the amino acid residues is indicated by the letters OA . With reference to the above Figure, fragment I may generally be prepared as follows. In order to protect the aminogroup of sarcosine, a water soluble basic addition salt of sarcosine is formed and dissolved in water. Conveniently, this basic addition salt can be formed by dissolving sarcosine in a slight molar excess of sodium hydroxide. To this solution is then simultaneously added a slight excess of a reagent for introducing the protecting group T e.g., the corresponding acid chloride such as benzyloxycarbonyl chloride and a solution of base e.g. sodium hydroxide to react with the acid e.g., HCl formed during the reaction. The protecting group adding reagent may be in solution or neat and is preferably the acid chloride. After reaction is complete, the excess protecting group adding reagent is removed e.g., by extraction with diethyl ether or any other organic solvent immiscible with water , following which the protected sarcosine is isolated from the unreacted sarcosine by treatment with acid e.g., hydrochloric acid . The acid treatment converts the basic addition salt of the unprotected sarcosine into an acid addition salt of the unprotected sarcosine, which salt is soluble in water. However, the acid treatment converts the protected sarcosine basic addition salt only into protected sarcosine, since no acid addition salt can be made due to the protected amino group. This protected sarcosine, being insoluble in water, is easily separated from the salt of the unprotected sarcosine for example by extraction with an immiscible organic solvent as described above. As used herein, the term immiscible organic solvent includes all common laboratory organic solvents which do not mix with water, such as for example diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, benzene, toluene, xylene, and the like. The preferred protected sarcosine, N benzyloxy carbonyl sarcosine, is a known compound. A method for its preparation is shown by R.S. Tipton and B.A. Pawson, In preparation for the condensation of this protected sarcosine with an L tyrosine amide molecule to form fragment I, the amino protected sarcosine should usually be activated in some fashion to promote the formation of the bond. While the preferred way of conducting this activation is by formation of an active ester , it is contemplated that other methods of activation known in the art such as the mixed or symmetrical anhydride, aside, or acid chloride methods could be employed. It is contemplated that any active ester of the protected sarcosine could be employed one preferred active ester is that formed by hydroxysuccinimide. The active ester of the protected sarcosine is prepared by reacting equivalent quantities of the protected sarcosine and an active ester reagent in solution of a suitable organic solvent such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethylformamide pyridine, or the like. To this solution is then added an equivalent amount of a coupling agent, typically dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. While other coupling agents are effective, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide is particularly useful because the by product of the coupling reaction is very insoluble in the class of solvents used, and therefore may easily be removed by filtration, leaving the coupled product in solution. L tyrosine amide is commercially available e.g., from Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO or may be prepared by known methods. The next step in the preparation of fragment I consists of reacting a molar equivalent of the L tyrosine amide with the protected sarcosine active ester in the presence of one equivalent of a salt forming material such as an organic tertiary amine. While any organic tertiary amine may be used, triethylamine has been found to work well. The solvent is a suitable organic solvent as described above. The unreacted amino acids are removed by treatment of the reaction mixture with acid e.g., acetic acid and separation by extraction with an immiscible organic solvent as described above. The final step is the removal of the alpha amino protecting group from the sarcosine, preferably with trifluoroacetic acid, to yield fragment I. The preparation of fragment IV generally starts with L aspartic acid which is protected on its beta carboxy group or L glutamic acid which is protected on its gamma carboxy group. This beta or gamma carboxy group is generally referred to as the omega group in accordance with accepted nomenclature to indicate that it is at the end of the chain. Exemplary of suitable carboxyl protecting groups are benzyl and benzyl in which the phenyl group is substituted with from one to three members each selected from halo e.g., chloro or bromo , nitro, C₁ C₃ loweralkoxy e.g., methoxy , or C₁ C₃ loweralkyl e.g., methyl . See the above referenced McOmie text for further description of such groups. Benzyl is preferred. This beta protected L aspartic acid and gamma protected L glutamic acid are available commercially from Bachem, Inc. Torrance, California, or may be prepared by known methods. The beta protected L aspartic acid or gamma protected L glutamic acid omega U Z is then allowed to react with an alpha amino protecting group adding reagent in a manner similar to that described above for adding an alpha amino protecting group to sarcosine. The product of this is beta protected alpha amino protected L aspartic acid or gamma protected alpha amino protected L glutamic acid alpha T omega U Z . The free carboxyl group of the protected Z is then activated as described above and is reacted with Fragment I to form Fragment IV. The alpha amino protecting group on the Z amino acid is then removed to form Fragment IVA. Fragment V is prepared by allowing an alpha amino and guanidino protected L arginine to react with a molar equivalent of X amino acid in the presence of e.g. 1 hydroxybenzotriazole. Following this, fragment V is joined to fragment IVA in the following fashion. Fragments V and IVA are joined by reacting equivalent amounts in a suitable aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide in the presence of a slight excess of a coupling agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. It is also preferred to conduct this reaction in the presence of a material which minimizes racemization adjacent to the carboxyl group on the sarcosine portion of fragment I and enhances the rate of reaction, such as for example 1 hydroxybenzotriazole. The reaction after removal of all the protective groups, yields the desired pentapeptide amide. The removal of the protective groups may be accomplished, for example, by treatment with hydrogen gas in the presence of a palladium on carbon catalyst in a suitable reducing solvent as described above preferably aqueous acetic acid . The hydrogen gas need not be under pressure greater than one atmosphere, although the use of pressure is convenient since it accelerates the rate of reduction. The isolation and purification of the resulting impure product may be accomplished by a combination of crystallization and ion exchange chromatography, preferably using ammonium acetate pH5 as eluent using thin layer chromatography to monitor the identity of the materials in each fraction. While several isolation and purification procedures are given in the following examples, it is clearly contemplated that others could be used. Also included within the scope of the present invention are compositions useful for practising the method, e.g. Fragments IV, IVA, as well as the protected products. The present invention is described in more detail, by way of illustration only with reference to the following Examples BOC Sarcosine 24.78g, 0.13 moles and N hydroxysuccinimide 15.5g, 0.13 moles were dissolved in 300 ml of dry THF and cooled to 5 .
