## Description
HYDROCYCLONE APPARATUS, PARTICULARLY FOR PRODUCING STARCH The present invention relates to a hydrocyclone apparatus, particularly for producing starch by centrifuging a suspension of starch and fibers in water, comprising a central block, a cover disposed adjacent one flat side of the block, a lower cover plate which bears against the opposite flat side of the block, an upper cover plate which bears against the flat side of the cover facing away from the block, hydrocyclones which consist each of a conical shell with open ends and a tangential inlet in the larger end and which extend between the opposite flat sides of the central block, hydrocyclone heads having central outlets and being so disposed in the flat side of the cover facing the block that they conform to the larger end of the hydrocyclones, inlet ducts which are defined by the facing flat sides of the central block and the cover and communicate with the inlets of the hydrocyclones, first outlet ducts which are defined by the facing flat sides of the central block and the lower cover plate and communicate with the smaller ends of the hydrocyclones, second outlet ducts which are defined by the facing flat sides of the cover and the upper cover plate and communicate with the outlets of the hydrocyclone heads, and means releasably holding together the central block, the cover and the cover plates. Hydrocyclones of this type have been used for starch production for about 25 years. Although having essential advantages, they also suffer from the shortcoming that they must be disassembled at short intervals of one to two weeks for cleaning of the inlet and outlet ducts, the hydrocyclones and the hydrocyclone heads. It is precisely to facilitate such cleaning that the ducts, the hydrocyclones and the heads are arranged in the manner defined by way of introduction, such that once the block and the plates have been disassembled all parts are exposed for flushing.The actual cleansing procedure thus causes no problem but the dismounting and in particular mounting operations are time consuming and complicated because many sturdy clamp bolts and nuts are used to ensure tight clamping of block and plates so as to prevent flow between inlet and outlet ducts. The tightening of bolts and nuts is normally carried out by means of dynamometric wrenches so that the same abutment pressure is obtained throughout the whole area of the block and the plates. The time consuming mounting and dismounting operations adversely affect the cost effectiveness of the apparatus, for which reason it has long been desirable to obtain improved clamping devices. The object of the present invention is to solve this problem such that mounting and dismounting can be effected very rapidly by means of an arrangement which will not at all or only insignificantly raise the costs of the apparatus. This object is achieved in that at least one cover plate has hydraulic means for tightly clamping said flat sides of the central block, the cover and the cover plates. The invention will be described in greater detail hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawing which, in cross section, illustrates a hydrocyclone apparatus according to the invention. The hydrocyclone apparatus as shown in the drawing has a central block 10 which is rectangular in both horizontal and vertical section. Between the opposite flat sides of the block 10 there extend a number of through openings 11 which have a widened portion at the top, as shown at 12, and at the bottom, by a shoulder, terminate a narrower portion 13. Hydrocyclones 14 of conventional design, consisting of a conical shell with a tangential inlet opening 15 at the wider end, are disposed in the openings 11 such that their lower narrower ends 37 are located on a level with the underside of the block 10 while their upper end portions are located in the widened portion 12 of the openings 11 with the upper boundary surface below the upper flat side of the block 10.The tangential inlet openings 15 of the hydrocyclones communicate with inlet ducts 17 which are provided in the upper flat side of the block 10. On the block 10 there is placed a cover 18 which has openings 19 conformed to the openings 11 in the block 10. Hydrocyclone heads 20 stand with a cylindrical portion into these openings 19 and abut with a flange on the flat side of the cover 18 which faces the block 10. The cylindrical portion of the heads terminates on the other side of the flange in a tapering projection. Through each hydrocyclone head there extends a central opening conically tapering in the same direction as the hydrocyclone body 14.The central opening of the hydrocyclone heads communicates with outlet ducts 22 provided in the flat side of the cover 18 remote from the block 10. The expert in the art is substantially acquainted with this arrangement of block 10, cover 18, hydrocyclones 14 and hydrocyclone heads 20. The central block 10 is disposed on a lower cover plate 24 which is of slightly larger dimensions in the horizontal plane than the block 10. The plate 24 has in its flat side facing the block 10 a number of outlet ducts which are so arranged that each hydrocyclone 14 opens in such a duct with its narrower end 37. A corresponding upper cover plate 27 whose dimensions in the horizontal plane also slightly exceed the corresponding dimensions of the central block has in one flat side a recess 28 whose dimensions in the horizontal plane correspond to those of the cover 18, so that the upper end of the cover is insertable therein with a suitable fit and sealed against the wall of the recess 28 by means of a circumferential O ring 29. A pressure plate 30 is disposed between the flat side of the cover 18 facing away from the block 10 and the bottom of the recess 28.The recess 28, along its periphery and adjacent its bottom, has a narrow shoulder so as to form a space 31 between the flat side of the pressure plate 30 remote from the cover 18 and the bottom of the recess 28. This space communicates with the exterior of the apparatus through a conduit 32 extending through the plate 30, the cover 18, the block 10 and the lower cover plate 24. A gasket 26 is mounted in a recess in the flat side of the plate 24 facing the block 10 to ensure sealing against the block and, to the same end, the cover 18 has gaskets 23 and 39 in recesses in its opposite flat sides to seal against the block 10 and the pressure plate 30, respectively.Through a number of registering openings 33 and 34 in the plates 27 and 24, there extend clamp bolts 35 with threaded ends, on which knobs or wheels 36 are screwed to make it possible, by tightening the knobs 36, to assemble the component parts of the hydrocyclone apparatus. It is assumed that the illustrated hydrocyclone apparatus is to be used for producing starch by centrifuging a suspension of starch and fibers in water.For mounting the apparatus, the plate 24 is first placed on a base and the block is then disposed on the flat side of the plate 24 which is provided with the outlet ducts 25, it being possible to make use of guide means to ensure that the block 10 is brought into the correct position with respect to the plate 24 and all the hydrocyclone outlets 37 communicate each with an outlet duct 25. The cover 10 is thereafter mounted in place, the hydrocyclone heads protruding from the flat side of the cover fitting into the hydrocyclones 14 in the block 10 in the manner shown in the drawing.The tangential inlet duct 15 will then also be delimited in the upward direction and the inlet ducts 17 will be closed. The pressure plate 30 is thereafter applied onto the cover 18, thus closing the outlet ducts 22.Then, the upper cover plate 27 is passed over the cover 18 with the pressure plate 30, such that the upper portion of the cover and the pressure plate 30 are introduced in the recess 28 of the plate 27 until the pressure plate 30 engages the shoulder adjacent the bottom of the recess 28, i.e. until it has assumed the position shown in the drawing. The thus mounted parts are then clamped together by means of the bolts 35 and the knobs 36. This manual clamping of the parts is by no means sufficient to ensure a tight engagement between the different flat sides to prevent an undesired suspension flow from the inlet ducts to the outlet ducts.For exertion of the required pressure, the conduit 32 is connected to a source for a pressurized medium, preferably water, which will thus flow into the space 31 to establish a pressure therein urging the pressure plate 30 towards the cover 18 and the block 10. It is obvious that by applying a suitable pressure one easily obtains the desired sealing between the surfaces and between cyclones and cyclone heads, the sealing effect being equally distributed throughout the entire area of the cover 18. Said suspension is charged through the inlet ducts 17 and from there flows into the hydrocyclones by their tangential inlets 15, whereby the suspension will be imparted a rotational movement along the hydrocyclone wall, which results in that the heavier starch particles will slide down along the inner sllrface of the hydrocyclones and be received in the outlet ducts 25, whereas the lighter fibers will flow out through the central openings of the hydrocyclone heads to be discharged through the outlet ducts 22. After some time of operation, the apparatus must be disassembled for cleaning, which is simply carried out in that the pressure in the space 31 is caused to cease, the knobs 36 are loosened and the different parts are separated and flushed. The parts are then reassembled in the manner described above and the apparatus is again ready for operation. Thus, the waste of time will become insignificant as opposed to such cases as require clamping the parts by means of a number of bolts and nuts. It is of course very essential that the pressure plate 30 be activated before suspension is supplied to the inlet ducts 17, for which reason a conventional pressostat is preferably disposed in the supply conduit for the pressure medium acting in the space 31.This pressostat thus prevents any feed of suspension before the correct pressure has been established in the space 31 and the parts of the apparatus have been brought into sealing engagement with each other. Most of the apparatuses of the above defined type have hitherto been manufactured of metal, but the apparatus according to the invention is advantageously made of plastic material, in particular rigid polyurethane.Further, the apparatus is shown with horizontal plates and block but in actual practice it is most often mounted with these parts vertical.
