# Multiple solution IV system.

## Abstract
A multiple solution IV administration system includes a plurality of IV fluid sources which are connected by flexible tub ing to the inlet of an IV pump. A sequence valve suspended from the tubing selctively pinches off all but one tube so that one source at a time is connected to the inlet. The sequence valve is controlled as a function of the accumulated volume pumped by the pump for each fluid and a stored volume limit for that fluid. When the accumulated volume of one IV fluid reaches its volume limit, the sequence valve is changed to connect a differ ent source to the inlet of the IV pump.
