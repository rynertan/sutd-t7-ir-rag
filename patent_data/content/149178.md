## Description
This invention relates to an infrared detector device for detecting infrared radiation which employs a Group III V compound semiconductor material. There presently exists a large market for systems which can detect infrared radiation, especially for night vision. Detector systems for infrared radiation are well known in the prior art and exist in many different forms. Infrared radiation detection systems which have found a great deal of acceptance in recent years have been based upon an alloy of mercury, cadmium and tellurium in stoichiometric amounts with the ratio of mercury to cadmium being adjustable to tune the material to the frequency of the infrared radiation. Such materials are known in the art as HgCdTe to include the broad spectrum of these materials. These HgCdTe materials are presently the preferred materials for second generation infrared detection systems. Despite the great acceptance of the prior art mercury, cadmium, telluride materials, these materials are subject to certain problems such as crystal size and purity, maturity of integrated circuit technology, optical currents, the relative instability of the surfaces thereof due to anodic oxidation which provides interfaces that are unable to stand up to 100 C environmental conditions, and the like. It is therefore desirable that, not only should the prior art HgCdTe technology be improved, but also, it is desirable that other materials be explored for infrared detectors which have properties superior to those found in existing systems. In APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS, vol. 43, no. 11, 1st December 1983, pages 1040 1042, New York, US F. CAPASSO et al. New long wavelength AlO.48InO.52As GaO.47InO.53As avalanche photodiode grown by molecular beam epitaxy an infrared detector having a III V substrate with a first layer of doped III V material is disclosed. Said detector further includes a second layer of moderate band gap III V material and a third layer of III V material having a wider bandgap than the second layer. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a detector for infrared radiation which is based on photoexcitation of carriers over a semiconductor heterojunction for collection, a simple heterojunction could be made of gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide a photon would be absorbed in the gallium arsenide by an electron which would then have sufficient energy to pass into the aluminum gallium arsenide where it would be detected. However, the quantum efficiency for such essentially free carrier absorption of a photon is low due to the lack of conservation of energy and momentum. In order to provide a higher quantum efficiency from a direct photon absorption process, the gallium arsenide infrared absorbing layer is replaced with an artificial superlattice structure. A superlattice is a lattice wherein the continuous energy bands of the conduction band are split up with very small gaps due to the periodic lattice structure. The lattice structure is preferably composed of N type doped gallium arsenide wherein, at spaced intervals, aluminum replaces some of the gallium sites. The spacing between the spaced sites is determined by the frequency of the infrared radiation to be detected. Thus, the present invention teaches a junctionless infrared detector, where in photons are absorbed by conduction band transitions in an absorbtion layer. The carriers thus excited by conduction band transitions are injected over an injection barrier, which is a heterojunction, and are preferably then collected against a further heterojunction collection barrier. The carriers collected at the collection barrier can then be periodically sensed. Preferably the absorption layer is a superlattice structure, so that the infrared photons can be absorbed by essentially direct conduction band transitions, rather than the necessarily indirect conduction band transition in a normal semiconductor. An infrared detector in accordance with the present invention comprises a conductive substrate of a Group III V material, preferably gallium arsenide. Upon this substrate is deposited the above described superlattice type structure of alternating thin layers of a wider and then a narrower energy band gap semiconductor material, aluminum gallium arsenide and gallium arsenide being the preferable materials. Upon this lattice structure there is deposited a layer of an alloyed semiconductor material of moderate band gap, aluminum gallium arsenide being the preferred material, into which photo excited carriers are injected. Upon this layer is deposited a further layer of wider band gap material, aluminum gallium arsenide with different aluminum gallium ratio being preferred. The superlattice structure is designed so that the energy gap between the first two mini bands , produced by the periodic lattice structure is equal to or less than the infrared photon energy. The doping is such as to nearly fill the first mini band with free carriers. Thus, infrared radiation will be efficiently absorbed, generating free carriers in the second mini band, etc. The band gap of the next layer is chosen so that these photo excited carriers may easily pass over the heterojunction into this layer, while those in the lower energy mini band are blocked. These carriers are propelled across the layer by an applied electric field and are collected at the interface or heterojunction with the next wide gap layer. Alternatively, a metal gate electrode is provided over an insulator at the top surface of the device. The above described device displays clear advantages over the prior art mercury cadmium telluride infrared detectors in that large area substrates can be provided, and more mature integrated circuit technology is available and a more stable interface for charge storage is provided. In addition dark currents are significantly smaller than the optical currents. Figure 1 is a circuit diagram of an imaging device using the photocapacitor detectors in accordance with the present invention, Figure 2 is a schematic diagram of a photocapacitor detector in accordance with the present invention, Figure 3 is an enlarged view of layer 13 of the detector of Figure 2, Figure 4 is a graph of the conduction band profile of the detector of Figures 2 and 3, and Figure 5 shows the band structure of the superlattice in more detail, showing the first and second mini bands within the conduction band. Referring first to Figure 1, there is shown a typical infrared imaging device having a plurality of infrared detector cells 1 formed on a substrate of gallium arsenide 11 Fig. 2 , which is undoped or slighly doped, each of the cells being coupled via an FET device 3 to column lines 5 and row lines 7 in a matrix arrangement whereby any one of the cells 1 can be addressed in well known manner. As shown in Figure 2, each of the cells 1 includes a substrate of gallium arsenide 11 e.g. doped Referring now to Figure 3, the layer 13 and its superlattice structure is shown in greater detail. As can be seen, a layer of N type doped gallium arsenide 31 is formed over the substrate 11, preferably by molecular beam epitaxy MBE to a predetermined layer height whereupon aluminum is added to the deposit to form a thin layer of aluminum gallium arsenide 33. This procedure continues on an alternating basis for the entire height of the layer 13. The regions with aluminum 33 are equally spaced from each other and the spacing therebetween is determined by the wave length of the infrared radiation to be received, it being apparent that the layer 13 is tuned to the frequency of radiation to be detected. The structure of Figure 3 provides a high degree of efficiency to the detector element. In actual operation, photons of infrared radiation will impinge upon the layer 13 and excite electrons therein by transfer of energy thereto. Those electrons that receive sufficient energy from the photons will be able to scale the barrier or heterojunction 17 between the layer 13 and the layer 15 as shown in Figure 4 and move into the layer 15 by traveling over the barrier 17. Superlattice layer 13 is shown simplified. The electrons that travel into layers 15 will then be collected against the heterojunction or barrier 21 which is the interface between the layers 15 and 19 or 15 and 23, if layer 19 is not used . With the electrons collected at the barrier 21, it can be seen that an appropriate sensing of the cell by the row and column lines 5 and 7 as shown in Figure 1 will cause detection of the charge on each of the formed capacitors to be sensed without loading the sense line down with capacitance from the addressed row. The operation of the various embodiments of the inventive device will now be described in slightly greater detail. Figure 5 shows the electronic structure of the conduction band of the superlattice layer 13 in slightly greater detail. The periodicity of the superlattice artificially imposes Brillouin zone boundaries 109. These boundaries 109 deform the normal parabolic potential curve 103, so that, instead of the normal parabolic potential curve 103, a first mini band 105, which is slightly deformed near the artificial boundary 109, is provided. Moreover, the upper portion of the parabolic potential 103 is also deformed, and is translated by the spatial periodicity of the superlattice structure, to provide a second mini band 107. The advantage of this is that direct transitions in the conduction band are now possible. That is, a transition from first mini band 105 to second mini band 107 can occur at a constant value of the wave number k. This means that photon absorption need not be phonon assisted. This means that photons are absorbed with greater efficiency, as discussed above. The height of the injection barrier must be chosen to be less than the height of the second mini band, so that the carriers which are injected into a second mini band 107 by photon absorption will be injected over the injection barrier, as discussed above. It should be noted that this structure gives a quite sharp long wavelength cutoff. If the absorption band of the structure is excessively large, then of course short wave length absorbing materials can simply be coated onto the surface of the structure. Preferably the superlattice uses N type background material, to take advantage of the lower electron mass. The background material of the superlattice is periodically alternated with very thin layers of a different material, to impose a periodic disturbance. The different material is preferably in layers thin enough about one monolayer in the preferred embodiment that carriers can tunnel through it easily. This means that carriers generated in any portion of the superlattice structure 13 can travel through the superlattice structure 13 to be injected over the barrier into the collection layer 15. The thin alternating layers need not be merely layers of a different band gap semiconductor, but can be formed of almost anything which imposes a periodic disturbance in the lattice characteristics, as long as the lattice crystal structure is perfectly preserved. Thus, as is known in the art, superlattice structures can be formed which have thin layers of metal or of insulator interspersed with the semiconductor layers More information on this aspect can be found in the article of L. Esaki et al Superfine Structures of Semiconductors grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy published in CRC Critical Reviews in Solid State Science, pages 195 207 April 1976 . It should also be noted that, although the presently preferred embodiment of the invention uses a photocapacitor structure, in which the carriers injected into collector layer 15 are collected at a collection barrier which is the heterojunction between collection layer 15 and a barrier layer 19, this not strictly necessary. A further embodiment of the invention is configured as a photoconductor, wherein the carriers injected into collection layer 15 are not merely stored in a collection well, but provided as an output current. Moreover, other embodiments are possible wherein, for example, the carriers injected into layer 15 are collected in an MIM metal insulator metal capacitor, or collected in other ways. In any case, a key teaching of the present invention is that a superlattice is abutted to a heterojunction having a barrier height which is intermediate the energies of the first and second mini bands of a superlattice, so that carriers which make a transition to the second mini band of the superlattice can be injected over the injection heterojunction barrier and thus provide an output signal corresponding to infrared photons. It should be noted that the present invention has been primarily described with reference to III V compound semiconductor materials, since the technology of these materials is highly developed and well understood. That is, MBE formation of gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide epitaxial layers is easy. A particular advantage of this system is that a very good lattice match is preserved between gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide layers, and the interface quality is very good. Epitaxial heterojunctions between different bandgap III V materials are also possible with other materials, as is very well known in the art. In addition, it is not, of course, necessary to form these structures by molecular beam epitaxy methods only, although this is the presently preferred method. Researchers working in chemical vapor deposition methods, such as organic metallic chemical vapor deposition, have reported good results with abrupt hetero epitaxy and thin layers in this technology, but MBE is certainly the preferred fabrication technique. In particular, it is much easier to make a superlattice having one layer so thin as to be almost a monolayer using MBE methods. In the presently preferred embodiment, as noted, N type gallium arsenide is preferably used for the thick layers of the superlattice. The superlattice period is calculated, in accordance with the energy of the longest wavelength photon which is desired to be detected, as follows the superlattice spacing L is selected so that is equal to the energy of the photon, where k in this equation is equal to 2 Ln. Thus, detection of longer wavelength photons requires larger superlattice periodicity. For five micron radiation, the energy of a photon h x v is about 0.25 electron volts, or 2 x 7 Joules. In gallium arsenide the effective mass of an electron m is equal to about 7 of its isolated mass m The doping of the N type gallium arsenide is preferably fairly heavy, to provide a large number of carriers, and therefore a good cross section for absorption of photons. In the presently preferred embodiment, the doping level of the absorption level 13 is high, preferably Two photo capacitors embodiments have been described. In one, the collection layer forms a heterojunction with an even higher band gap epitaxial barrier layer, eg. pure aluminum arsenide, and a gate 25 is provided atop this barrier layer. Alternatively, the signal charge can be collected in an MIS diode, which can comprise, e.g., a layer 23 of an insulator and a layer 25 of a conductor on top of the collection layer 15. The maximum on the practical doping level of the absorption layer 13 is imposed by dark current. That is, the number of carriers in the first mini band must not be so high as to spill over into the second mini band, which would cause dark current to be injected into the collection layer, nor even so high as to provide many carriers within a few kT of the injection barrier height at the operating temperature, again to avoid excess dark current. In general, to reduce polarization sensitivity and thereby improve the ratio of signal current to dark current, the absorption layer l3 can be further modified, so it is not only vertically periodic as discussed above, but also laterally periodic with dimensions comparable to the vertical periodicity. This lateral periodicity increases the quantum efficiency of the device, but requires greatly increased processing cost, and is therefore not presently preferred. It should be noted that the present invention is believed to be the first to teach use of III V materials for long infrared absorption. II VI superlattice structures have been previously proposed, but the materials and processing characteristics of III V materials are generally much better understood and much more favorable. Though the invention has been described with respect to a specific preferred embodiment thereof, many variations and modifications will immediately become apparent to those skilled in the art. It is therefore the intention that the appended claims be interpreted as broadly as possible in view of the prior art to include all such variations and modifications.
