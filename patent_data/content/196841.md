Unless defined otherwise, as used herein the term lower alkyl means a branched or unbranched saturated hydrocarbon chain containing one to six carbon atoms. Examples include such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, tert butyl, n pentyl, n hexyl and the like. As used herein the term fluoroalkyl means a branched or unbranched saturated alkyl chain which is substituted with one or more up to five fluorine atoms. Examples include 2,2,2 trifluoroethyl and 3,3,3,2,2 pentafluoropropyl, and the like. As used herein the term lower alkoxy means the group OR wherein R is alkyl as defined above. Examples include such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, tert butoxy, n hexyloxy and the like. As used herein the term optional or optionally means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. As used herein the term lower alkyl optionally omega substituted means a lower alkyl group as previously defined having an optionally substituted group at the carbon atom furthest from the point of attachment to the remainder of Formula A . As used herein the term Aryl means an optionally substituted aromatic radical containing 6 to 12 ring carbon atoms, particularly optionally substituted phenyl or naphthyl. As used herein the term optionally substituted phenyl means a phenyl, which may or may not be substituted as indicated above, with one to three substituents selected from the group consisting of halo, lower alkyl, or lower alkoxy, both having from one to four carbon atoms, hydroxy, and trifluoromethyl. As used herein the term pharmaceutically acceptable salts refers to those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the free bases and which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, menthanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like. The compounds of formula A also form salts with inorganic bases such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, aluminum trihydroxide, magnesium hydroxide or with organic bases such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, ethanolamine, 2 dimethylaminoethanol or tromethamine. As used herein the term acid derivative includes but is not limited to esters lower alkyl, benzyl or silyl , amides, acid chlorides, hydroxamic acids and the like. As used herein the term proline analog refers to the heterocyclic compounds from which the above described residues II to VI are derived. As used herein the term sulfonyloxy refers to lower alkylsulfonyloxy or to 6 12C arylsulfonyloxy groups. Unless defined otherwise the formula R¹ The compounds of this invention have an alkyl substituted guanidine functionality for one of the amino acid residues, R² or R³. Arginine, a naturally occurring amino acid, has an unsubstituted guanidine functionality. In those compounds of this invention having an arginine derivative as a component the compounds of Formula I with n being 3 , both terminal nitrogens on the guanidino functionality of the arginine are substituted with an alkyl functionality. Examples include N The alkyl groups make the guanidino functionality more lipophilic and strongly basic, and therefore more able to interact more strongly with cellular membranes. Certain compounds of this invention include the proline analogs II, III and VI. These proline analogs include 3 carboxy 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro isoquinoline THIQ , 2 carboxy 2,3 dihydro indole, 4,5 trimethylene proline which is the same as 3 carboxy 2 aza bicyclo 3.3.0 octane , and the like. The hydrocarbon group attached to the proline makes these proline analogs more lipophilic than proline. Such a proline analog is therefore more able to interact more strongly with cellular membranes than non substituted proline. The compounds of this invention containing proline analogs II, III and VI are bound more tightly to the cell membranes because of the combined effects of the alkyl substituted guanidine functionality and the hydrocarbon group of the proline analog. This causes a depoting of the compound in the body and places the proline analog containing compounds of the invention nearer to the presumed site of action for a longer time than similar compounds without these features, resulting in a more potent and longer acting pharmaceutical effect. The compounds of this invention form salts with inorganic and organic acids and bases. These salts are also within the scope of this invention. Such salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts like sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts like calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases, for example, dicyclohexylamino salts, n methyl d glucamine salts, salts with amino acids like arginine and the like. Also salts with organic and inorganic acids may be prepared, for example, HCl, HBr, H₂SO₄, H₃PO₄, methanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, maleic, fumaric acid and the like. The non toxic physiologically acceptable salts are preferred although other salts are useful, for example, in isolating or purifying the product. As described in more detail below the salts may be formed by conventional means as by reacting the free acid or free base forms of the product with one or more equivalents of the appropriate base or acid in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble, or in a solvent such as water which is then removed under vacuum or by freeze drying or by exchanging the cations of an existing salt for another cation on a suitable ion exchange resin. The compounds of this invention are ACE inhibitors and thus block the conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a highly potent pressor substance. Thus, ACE inhibitors can lower blood pressure by inhibiting the biosynthesis of angiotensin II, especially in animals and humans whose hypertension is angiotensin II related. Furthermore, ACE degrades the vasodilating substance bradykinin. Therefore, ACE inhibitors may lower blood pressure by potentiating bradykinin s effects, as well as by inhibiting angiotensin II. Although the relative importance of these and other possible mechanisms remains to be established, ACE inhibitors are known to be effective antihypertensive agents in a variety of animal models and are useful clinically, for example, in many human patients with malignant renovascular and essential hypertension. A number of A useful The compounds disclosed herein have proven to be potent and long acting ACE inhibitors both Thus, the compounds of this invention are useful as antihypertensives in treating hypertensive mammals, including humans. They can be used to reduce blood pressure in standard pharmaceutical compositions such as tablets, capsules, elixirs for oral administration or in sterile solutions or suspensions. The specific dosing regime will depend on a number of factors such as the individual s weight, severity of the disease and the like. The compounds of this invention may be given in combination with other diuretics or antihypertensives. Typically, these are combinations whose individual daily dosages range from one fifth of the minimally recommended clinical dosages to the maximum recommended levels for the entities when they are given singly. To illustrate these combinations, one of the antihypertensives of this invention is effective clinically in the range 1 200 mg per day and can be effectively combined at levels ranging from 1 200mg per day with the following antihypertensives and diuretics in dose ranges per as indicated hydrochlorothiazide 15 200 mg , chlorothiazide 125 200 mg , ethacrynic acid 15 200 mg , amiloride 5 20 mg , furosemide 5 80 mg , propanolol 20 480 mg , timolol 5 50 mg , methyldopa 65 2000 mg , and nicardipine 5 20 mg . In addition, triple drug combinations such as but not limited to that of hydrochlorothiazide 15 200 mg plus amiloride 5 20 mg plus the ACE inhibitor of this invention 1 200 mg are effective combinations to control blood pressure in hypertensive patients. The above dose ranges will be adjusted on a unit basis as necessary to permit divided daily dosage. Also, the dose will vary depending on the severity of the disease, the weight of the patient and other factors which a person skilled in the art will recognize. The compounds of Formula A have been shown in standard laboratory tests to be ACE inhibitors. Accordingly, the compounds of Formula A or their salts or pharmaceutical compositions containing them, may be used in inhibiting the production of angiotensin II, thereby preventing, or controlling hypertension. Administration of the active compounds of Formula A and salts described herein can be via any of the accepted modes of administration for ACE inhibitors. These methods include oral, parenteral and otherwise systemic. Depending on the intended mode of administration, the compositions used may be in the form of solid, semi solid or liquid dosage forms, such as, for example, tablets, suppositories, pills, capsules, powders, liquids, suspensions, or the like, preferably in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. The compositions will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and an active compound of Formula A or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and, in addition, may include other medicinal agents, pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc. For solid compositions, conventional non toxic solid carriers include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like. The active compound as defined above may be formulated as suppositories using, for example, polyalkylene glycols, for example, propylene glycol, as the carrier. Liquid pharmaceutically administerable compositions can, for example, be prepared by dissolving, dispersing, etc. an active compound as defined above and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier, such as, for example, water, saline solutions, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension. If desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like, for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine sodium acetate, triethanolamine oleate, etc. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art for example, see For the compounds of Formula A , either oral or intravenous administration is preferred depending on the nature of the disorder being treated. For oral administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic composition is formed by the incorporation of any of the normally employed excipients, such as, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like. Such compositions take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained release formulations and the like. Such compositions may contain 1 95 active ingredient, preferably 25 70 . The minimum effective oral dose for spontaneously hypertensive rats of the compounds of this invention is from about 0.01 to 10 mg Kg body weight. The precise dosage depends on the species receiving the dosage, the severity of the disease state, the manner of administration, the judgment of the prescribing physician and other factors well known in the art. In humans, a minimum effective oral dosage for a 70 Kg human would be between in the range of about 1 mg and 700 mg. No toxic effects have been observed in orally administered dosages in spontaneously hypertensive rats in excess of ten times the minimum effective oral dosage. The compounds of formula A can be produced by a variety of methods known in oligopeptide synthesis. The synthetic approaches are apparent from the numbered dotted lines 1 to 16 in formula A below and the substructure below the formula which depicts the substituents R² and R³ with more specificity. The dotted lines point schematically to the respective reaction sites and the ensuing table gives a brief description of the various chemical methods that will be described in more detail below. The last column of the table and the letter symbols in parentheses refer to the respective step in the description and in the process claim s . Basically the synthesis proceeds in 3 steps. First, those amino or carboxylic groups which are not to participate in the synthesis reaction must be chemically blocked. This also applies to other groups in the molecule which may react during the synthesis of the dipeptide for example, the hydroxy, the mercapto or the oxo group in the proline analog substituent V and in the proline analog IV , respectively . The qualifications of potential blocking agents that render them suitable for use in the synthesis of the dipeptide of formula A include The most generally useful blocking groups for the synthesis of the dipeptide are the following. Carboxyl groups are generally blocked through formation of the corresponding lower alkyl or silyl, e.g. tri lower alkylsilyl or triaryl 6 12C silyl, such as optionally substituted triphenylsilyl or benzyl esters. The esterifications are accomplished by conventional means that will be described in more detail below. Once the dipeptide structure corresponding to formula A is produced the lower alkyl groups are hydrolyzed by basic or mild acid conditions as described in more detail below. The benzyl group may be removed by hydrolysis or, preferably, by hydrogenation, in particular by catalytic hydrogenation over palladium as described in more detail below. A greater range of reagents is employed for the blocking of the amino function. Representative blocking groups include halocarbonates such as 6 12C aryl lower alkyl halocarbonates such as benzyl halo carbonates or biphenylalkyl halo carbonates, in particular benzylchlorocarbonate tertiary alkyl halocarbonates such as tertiary butylhalocarbonates, in particular t butylchlorocarbonate BOC Cl or di lower alkyldicarbonates, in particular di t butyl di carbonate triphenylmethyl halides such as triphenylmethyl chloride and trifluoroacetic anhydride. Reaction of the amino group with 6 12C aryl halo carbonates, in particular, benzylchlorocarbonate yields the corresponding carboaryloxy derivatives, in particular the benzyloxycarbonyl or carbobenzoxy symbolized by CBZ derivative The aralkyloxycarbonyl function, in particular the CBZ function, is readily removed by treatment with acids such as HBr in glacial acetic acid, catalytic reduction such as catalytic hydrogenation over palladium, or with sodium in liquid ammonia. Triphenylmethyl trityl derivatives of the amino group are produced employing triphenylmethyl chloride according to the following equation Ph ₃C Cl H₂N .... Ph ₃C NH .... HCl This group is readily removed by hydrogenation, in particular catalytic hydrogenation over palladium or hydrolytically with acids in a manner known per se. Related reactions are available for the introduction and removal of other amino group blocking agents. In the compounds of formula A the carbon atom to which R⁵ is attached is asymmetric. In addition, by definition one of the carbon atoms to which R² and R³ is attached is also asymmetric. For the preferred compounds of formula A, R² or R³ is a substituent other than hydrogen, i.e. lower alkyl optionally omega substituted with phenyl or naphthyl. For these compounds, the third carbon to which R² or R³ is attached is also asymmetric. The compounds accordingly exist in diastereoisomeric forms or in mixtures thereof. The synthesis of the dipeptides can utilize racemates, enantiomers or diastereomers as starting materials. When diastereomeric products result from synthetic procedures, the diastereomeric products can be separated by conventional methods, e.g. chromatographic methods or fractional crystallization. In general, the amino acid sub structures having two or more asymmetric carbon atoms in the compounds of formula A are preferred in the S configuration. All the reactions carried out on the derivatives of the amino acids of which the dipeptide of formula A is composed, and all reaction conditions chosen for the preparation of these dipeptides and the conversion of the dipeptide derivatives into other dipeptide derivatives for example, esters to amides or esters to the free acids have to take into account the temperature dependence or relative thermodynamic instability of the amino acids and dipeptide derivatives involved. Therefore, the reaction temperatures employed in steps a through s , in general, will be in the range between 30 C to 100 C, and preferably shall not exceed 50 C. The salts of the compounds of formula A may be formed by conventional means. Preferably the free acid or the free base forms of the formula A are reacted with 1 or more up to 2 equivalents of the appropriate salt forming base or acid in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble, or in a solvent which can be removed in vacuo or by freeze drying, or by exchanging the cations of an existing salt for another cation on a suitable ion exchange resin. The conventional salt formation is carried out at temperatures between 20 to 50 C, preferably at about room temperature. In summary, the invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of one of the previously described groups 1 to 14 having the general formula A The process comprises Step a of Approaches 7 and 8 involves the hydrolysis of one or both lower alkoxy or benzyl esters of the substructures R¹ CO or CO R⁶. Any conventional hydrolytic conditions may be employed which do not affect the peptide bond CO N R⁴ or racemize the dipeptide in case diastereomeric products are the desired end products. The hydrolysis of step a is carried out under acid or basic conditions and leads to the diacid form, which is thought to be the biologically active form. The reaction temperature for the hydrolysis will be in the range of 0 to 70 C and the reaction will be carried out in an inert solvent containing water or in water. In general, the acid employed will be between 0.1 and 2 normal. If the reaction is carried out under basic conditions, the solution will be 0.1 to 2 normal with respect to the base employed. If the reaction is carried out under basic conditions, in order to obtain the diacid, the reaction mixture will have to be acidified with acid, such as hydrochloric, acetic or sulfuric acid. The acidification will be carried out between 20 and 40 C, since the peptide bond is sensitive to temperature, particularly if the dipeptide is present in enantiomeric form. Temperatures between 20 and 30 C are preferred. Appropriate acids for the acid hydrolysis of Step a are inorganic and organic acids. The following inorganic acids can be used hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. The following organic acids can be used for the acid hydrolysis trifluoroacetic acid, trichloroacetic, citric or oxalic acid, and the like. The following inorganic bases can be used for the basic hydrolysis sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide and the like. The following organic bases can be employed for basic hydrolysis trimethylamine, triethylamine, dicyclohexylamine and the like. The amides of formula A can be hydrolyzed in a manner known per se to the dipeptides of formula A in water or inert solvents containing water using bases or acids as catalysts. The reaction proceeds between 20 to 100 C. Step b of Approach 7 and 8 involves the hydrogenolysis of benzyl esters. It is self evident that hydrogenolysis is the method of choice for the production of the two monoesters of Formula A the compounds wherein R¹ is hydroxy and R⁶ is lower alkoxy and the compounds in which R¹ is lower alkoxy and R⁶ is hydroxy because the hydrogenolysis will not remove the lower alkoxy groups. The monoesters are thought to be pro drugs. The hydrogenolysis is generally carried out catalytically by hydrogen in the presence of a noble metal, preferably on a carrier, for example, palladium or platinum or rhodium on a carrier such as carbon, or by hydrogen in the presence of Raney nickel. The inert carrier such as carbon will generally contain 5 to 30, preferably 10 percent of the noble metal, in particular palladium. The reaction temperature will be between 0 and 40 C, preferably at about room temperature, under atmospheric pressure or super atmospheric pressure up to 10 atm . The reaction times generally range between 30 minutes to 24 hours. Step c of Approaches 5 and 6 involves the reduction of a carbonyl group in one of the side chains R² and R³. A variety of reduction conditions and reducing agents are applicable. If enantiomeric products are desired, these conditions must not racemize the dipeptide. If R¹ or R⁶ is a benzyloxy group which must be removed, catalytic hydrogenation is the method of choice. Catalytic hydrogenolysis by the above described conditions, for example, contact with molecular hydrogen and 10 percent palladium on carbon will not only reduce the oxo function but also will remove the benzyl ester group to form a compound of Formula A. However, other reductive conditions under mild temperatures such as modified Wolff Kishner reductions with hydrazine are also applicable. Step f of Approach 2 and step h of Approach 3 involve reductive condensations. In both steps an α ketoacid derivative is condensed with a free amino group of an amino acid in step f or of a dipeptide in step h . The reaction is carried out either in an aqueous solution, optimally in a roughly neutral aqueous solution, or in a suitable organic solvent. The following solvents are suitable, for example nitriles such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, cyclic ethers such as THF or dioxane, lower alkanols such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and the like or mixtures of these solvents. The reaction conditions correspond to those of a Schiff condensation. In order to reduce the intermediate Schiff base directly which is the condensation product, the reaction can be carried out in the presence of a reducing agent such as a borohydride complex, for example, sodium cyano borohydride. The reaction proceeds between 0 C and 40 C, preferably at about room temperature. In a preferred embodiment of reductive condensation step f , the amino acid of step f in the form of its ester is condensed with the α ketoacid derivative as follows Alternatively, if the condensation is carried out without a reducing agent being initially present, the Schiff base of step g will be formed which is an enamine which may be catalytically reduced by hydrogen under conditions described above using, for example, as catalyst palladium or platinum on carbon or Raney nickel and the like. Again, 10 percent palladium on carbon, or Raney nickel are the catalysts of choice. Step i of Approach 1 constitutes the classical formation of the peptide bond. This may be accomplished through activation of the carboxyl group in several fashions. The principal pitfall to be avoided is racemization of the amino acids during the reaction. Racemization yields several products that are frequently very difficult to separate. Suitably activated forms of the carboxyl group include carboxylic acid chlorides where, however, sometimes racemization occurs , nitro substituted 6 to 12C aryl esters, in particular p nitrophenyl esters, cyanomethyl esters and thioesters. In each case these activated derivatives react smoothly with the amino function or with the imino function of proline, a proline derivative, a proline analog or its derivatives. In addition, other methods are available that avoid the synthesis of carboxyl activated intermediates. Preferably the methods involve carbodiimides, such as dicycloalkyl 3 7C carbodiimides, in particular dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCCI , as dehydrating agents. It is assumed that this synthesis would proceed as follows The dipeptides of formula A can also be produced using the known solid phase technique, in particular using as solid phase polyamide resins that are swellable by polar solvents such as water. After completion of the synthesis the dipeptide will be removed from the polyamide by hydrolysis, hydrogenolysis, or transesterification. In general, the condensation reaction conditions will correspond to those used in methods known in the art applied to compounds sensitive to temperature and racemization. In alkylation step n of Approach 2, alkylation step m of Approach 3, alkylation step j of Approach 4, an amino acid derivative, or a dipeptide with a free amino group, are alkylated with an appropriate alkylating agent. In step 1 of Approach 10 a guanidino substituted dipeptide is alkylated. In alkylation step o of Approach 11 a dialkyl substituted guanidine is alkylated by a dipeptide functioning as an alkylating agent. In step n the alkylating agent is an α halo acyl or α sulfonyloxyacyl amino acid derivative and the reaction will be conducted under basic conditions in water or in another solvent containing the substrate to be alkylated and adding the alkylating agent. The reaction temperature will be kept between 20 and 70 C, preferably at about room temperature. The nature of the acyl group depends on the choice of the substituent R³. For example, α Chloro or α bromoacetylated aminoacids can be used as alkylating agents. In step m a dipeptide is dissolved in an appropriate solvent and is alkylated with the appropriate α haloacid ester or amide or α sulfonyloxy acid ester or amide under basic conditions in water or an organic solvent. The temperature will be kept between 0 and 70 C, preferably at about room temperature. The α halogen is chloro, bromo, or iodo or P can be a lower alkylsulfonyloxy or a aryl 6 to 12C sulfonyloxy group. In step j the dipeptide is alkylated with an alkylating guanidino derivative substituted by halo, i.e., chloro, bromo, or iodo, or a lower alkyl mercapto group guanylating agent . Preferably the reaction is conducted by reacting the dipeptide with an S alkyl isothiourea derivative to form the compounds of Formula A. Particularly preferred is S methyl isothiourea. In the alkylation with S methyl isothiourea, the methylmercapto group will be the leaving group. The reaction is carried out in a suitable aqueous or organic solvent or solvent mixture under basic conditions p Alkylation step 1 is carried out by alkylating the dipeptide of this step with a lower alkyl alkylating agent optionally substituted with 1 to 5 fluoro atoms. The lower alkylating agent will have as leaving group either chloro, bromo, or iodo or sulfonyloxy. Examples for such alkylating agents are methyl bromide, methyl iodide, 2,2,2 trifluoro 1 bromoethane, n hexyl bromide, etc. This reaction is carried out under basic conditions in water or in an organic solvent in the presence of base which accepts the hydrochloric, hydrobromic or hydroiodic acid formed under the alkylating conditions. The temperature will be between 0 to 70 C, preferably at about room temperature. In alkylation step o the dipeptide contains an alkylating group with an ω halo or ω sulfonyloxy group for the alkylation of the guanidino derivative. The reaction employs strongly basic conditions, preferably a suitable organic solvent such as DMF, acetonitrile, propionitrile, dioxane and the like. Esterification step k is carried out by classical esterification procedures. In the reaction lower alkanols or benzyl alcohol react with the dipeptide of formula A in the presence of strong inorganic or organic acids under the removal of water. The following inorganic acids can be used hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, and the like. The following organic acids can be used trifluoroacetic acid, sulfonic acids such as perfluorosulfonic, toluenesulfonic acid, and the like. However, the esters of formula A can also be produced using diazoalkenes in particular diazomethane which will give the methyl ester. The reaction will usually be carried out in an inert solvent. Another method that can be used is the reaction of a metallic salt of a compound of formula A which reacts with a lower alkyl or benzyl halide to form a corresponding lower alkyl or benzyl ester. The sodium or cesium salt of the dipeptide or other metal salts can be used to obtain the ester in good yields. In addition, salts of tertiary amines such as 1,8 diazabicyclo 5.4.0 undec 7 ene, or tri lower alkyl amines, in particular, triethylamine can employed because of their better solubility. In another modification of step k the esterification is carried out by reacting an acyl halide or diacyl halide of a compound of formula A with a lower alkanol or with benzyl alcohol. This leads to a rapid formation of the ester. In the reaction, 1 mole of the acyl halide is reacted with at least 2 moles of the lower alkanol or benzyl alcohol and the reaction proceeds smoothly to obtain the corresponding diester. In a preferred embodiment the reaction is facilitated by the formation of an adduct with thionylchloride and the lower alkanol or benzyl alcohol at temperatures below 0 C which reacts quickly to form the ester. In another modification of the process a mixed acid anhydride of the dipeptide of formula A is reacted with an alkanol or benzyl alcohol. The reaction is catalyzed by tertiary organic bases such as pyridine. It is understood that in condensation step f and h under reductive conditions the α ketoacid derivative can be the free acid or its ester. The amino acid derivative or the dipeptide derivative can be in the form of the free acid or of the ester, amide or hydroxamic acid. In the alkylation steps, the alkylating agent of steps n and o may be in the form of the free acid, its ester, or its amide. The amino acid or dipeptide derivative in all these alkylating steps may also be present in the form of their esters or amides. The amides of the peptides of formula A in which at least one of R¹ and R⁶ is the amino group optionally substituted with one or two lower alkyl groups are prepared by common methods known for the preparation of amides. If only one of R¹ and R⁶ is an optionally substituted amino group the compounds are monoamides, whereas if both R¹ and R⁶ are an optionally substituted amino group these dipeptides are diamides. Ammonia or lower alkyl or dialkyl amines can be reacted directly with derivatives of the formula A in particular lower alkyl esters or acid chlorides or acid anhydrides which function as acylating derivatives. Ammonia and the lower alkyl amines primary amines and the di lower alkyl amines secondary amines react very smoothly with these acylating agents. With anhydrides the reaction can be even conducted in aqueous solution. The reaction with acyl halides requires two moles of amine or ammonia, only one of which will be acylated because the second mole combines with the hydrogen halide formed in the reaction. If the acylating agent is an anhydride only one mole of amine or ammonia can be used because the free acid formed is a weak acid and the salt of a weak base and the weak acid dissociates to produce the acylated amine when heated with an excess of the anhydride. Therefore all the amine can be converted into amide by this procedure. If esters are used as acylating agents again the amine and the ester acylation will be reacted in an approximate molar ratio of one to one. The acylation can be conducted in non acqueous solutions, i.e., in inert solvents such as DMF, lower alkanols such as methanol or ethanol , and the like. The reaction temperatures will be between 20 and 40 C preferably at about 35 C. The conversions of steps p , q and r are usually carried out in inert solvents at temperatures between 20 and 50 C, preferably between 10 and 30 C. In step p the acid addition salt of the dipeptide which may be mono or dibasic is treated with the appropriate equivalent amount of base to form the monobasic salt, the free dipeptide or to form its salt with the base. In step q the dipeptide salt with base is the starting material and treated with the appropriate equivalent of acid to form the monobasic salt, the free dipeptide or the acid addition salt which contains one or two protonated nitrogens . It is understood that the free dipeptides of formula A exist in a zwitterionic form, any carboxylic groups being dissociated COO and the imino group s or the N R⁷ group being associated with a proton. In step r a salt of a dipeptide is reacted with an inorganic or organic salt to precipitate a less soluble salt double decomposition . Alternatively, this exchange can be carried out with appropriately charged ion exchange resins. The starting materials of steps c , f , g , h , i , j , l , m , n and o are either known from the literature or can be made by known methods from known starting materials e.g. European Patent Applications 12401, 65301 and 79022 . For example, the oxo substituted compound of step c can be produced by the following reaction scheme In Reaction Scheme I, the BOC protected guanidino substituted amino acid is first coupled to a proline ester, or a proline analog ester e.g., benzylprolinate or a benzylprolinate analog using, for example, DCCI as dehydrating agent thus forming a dipeptide. The dipeptide is then deprotected with HCl ethyl acetate to obtain the free amino group which is reacted in a Michael like reaction with an unsaturated Michael acceptor such as a lower alkyl benzoyl, naphthoyl or lower alkanoyl substituted acrylate or a corresponding benzyl acrylate. Ethyl 3 benzoylacrylate is a preferred Michael acceptor. The Michael like addition results in the protected starting material for step c .
