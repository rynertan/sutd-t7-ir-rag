## Description
Method and apparatus for the cancellation of interference signals from a number n of sources during the reception of return signals by a pulse radar. The invention relates to a method for the cancellation of interference signals from a number n of sources during the reception of target return signals by a pulse radar, of which the receiver comprises a main channel for the reception, i.f.detection, sampling and digitising of signals Em , composed of target return signals elm and of interference signals, and n auxiliary channels for the reception, i.f. detection, sampling and digitising of signals E1, E2, ..., En composed of target return signals and interference signals. The invention further relates to the pulse radar apparatus employed to implement said method. Such a method and a similar pulse radar apparatus provided with a digital side lobe canceller are known from an article ofIEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, Vol. AES 14,No. 1, January 1978, pp. 165 171, A digital open loop adaptiveProcessor , by Frank F. Kretschmer 3r and Bernard L. Lewis.This article describes a digital side lobe caaceller for the case when n 1, i.e. the unit is suitable for the cancellation of interference signals originating from one interference source and the receiver therefore comprises one auxiliary channel. To cancel interference signals from n sources, the desired interference cancellation is obtained by applying the latter canceller in a cascaded configuration, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,222,051.However, in such a cascaded configuration the cancellation of interference signals appears to be strongly dependent upon the phase relations between the signals from one and the same interference source in the different channels primary and auxiliary channels of the receiver. The present invention has for its object to considerably reduce this phase dependency, and thereby to enhance the interference cancellation. According to the invention, the method as set forth in the opening paragraph comprises the steps of a determining from the received, detected, sampled and digitised signals Em, E1, E2, ..., E quantities corresponding with the n valuesE1 Em, E2 Em, ..., En Em E1 E1, E2 E1, ..., En E1 E1 E2, E2 E2, ..., En E2 ..... E1 En, E2 En, ..., En En b averaging the values in a over several samples to the values E1 Em, E2 Em, ..., En Em E1 E1, E2 E1, ..., En E1 E1 E2, E2 E2, ..., En E2 ..... E1 En, E2 En, ..., En En c solving the weights W1, W2, ..., Wn from the matrix equation EMI2.1 d determining from the signals Em, E1, E2, ..., E delayed over n the total processing time of steps a , b and c and from weights W1, W2, ..., W the target return signals n Em Em W1E1 W2E2 ... WnEn processed in the main channel. The weights W1, W2, ..., W determined by this method are n equal to those obtained in the analogue side lobe canceller after the settling process. The analogue side lobe canceller is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,202,990. The settling process however appears to be again strongly dependent upon the phase relations between the signals of one and the same interference source in the receiver the settling process could therefore be extended considerably, while the extent of interference cancellation could remain far from its optimal value. For the case when n 1, the method here applied appears to be equivalent to that described in the aforementioned article in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems . A preferred embodiment of a pulse radar apparatus suitable for the application of the method according to the invention will be dependent upon n. For n 1 or 2,a hardware implementation is expected to receive preference, whereas for larger values of n the pulse radar apparatus is to contain a programmable signal processor to execute the processing steps of the method according to the invention. The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing the operating principle of the pulse radar apparatus for the cancellation of interference signals originating from a number n of sources, according to the invention Fig. 2 is a more detailed block diagram of the digital side lobe canceller for the case when n 1 and Fig. 3 is a more detailed block diagram of such a digital side lobe canceller for the case when n 2. Like parts in the figures are denoted by like reference numbers. In Fig. 1 the receiver of a pulse radar apparatus is denoted by the numeral 1. Receiver 1 comprises a main channel 2 and n auxiliary channels 3a, 3b, ..., 3n. Both the main and auxiliary channels are suitable for the reception, i.f. detection, sampling and digitising of target return signals and interference signals originating from a maximum number n of sources. The number of auxiliary channels determines the maximum number of interference sources, of which the interference signals can be cancelled. The main channel comprises an antenna directed at the target this antenna receives in the side lobes signals from interference sources, apart from the target return signals Em in the major lobe. m The target return signals processed in the main channel and interference signals are jointly denoted by Em. The n auxiliary channels comprise in general omni directional antennas the target returns processed in these channels and interference signals are jointly denoted by E1, E2, ..., E . In both the main channel n and each of the auxiliary channels a quadrature detector is employed, being a combination of two phase sensitive detectors used to detect the signals, processed in the channels, with a mutual phase shift of 900. In this way the real and imaginary components of signals Em, E1, E2, ..., E are obtained. These n components are conventionally sampled and digitised by AD converters contained in each of the channels.Signals Ek, where k m, 1, 2, ..., n,from channels 2, 3a, 3b, ..., 3n are thus composed of two digitised signals Re Ek and Im Ek , per sample. The pulse radar apparatus contains first means to determine from signals Em, E1, E2, ..., En the quantities corresponding with values E1 E m E21 Em, ..., En Em E1 E1, E2 E1, ..., En E1 E1 E2, E2 E2, ..., En E2 ..... E1 En, E2 En, ..., En EnThese means are constituted by logical unit 4. Each of the abovementioned quantities is composed of two numerical values, representing the real and the imaginary components. The quantityEi Ej thus comprises the numbersRe Ei Ej Re Ei . Re Ej Im Ei . Im Ej andIm Ei Ej Re Ei . Im Ej Im Ei . Re Ej for i 1,2, ..., n and j m, 1, 2, ..., n. The pulse radar apparatus also comprises second means to average the quantities E1 Em, E2 Em, ..., En Em E1 E1 E1, E2 E1, ..,En E1 E1 E2, E2 E2, ..., En E2 ..... E1 En, E2 En, ..., En En over several samples to values E1 Em, E2 Em, ..., En Em E1 E1, E2 E1, ..., En F1 E1 E2, E2 E2, ..., En E2 ..... E1 En, E2 En, E E . These means are constituted by averaging circuit 5. n En Also in this circuit the real and the imaginary components of EiX EJ are averaged separately the quantity Ei Ej is thus composed of two digital numerical values Re Ei Ej and Im Ei Ej . The pulse radar apparatus further comprises third means to determine the values W1, W2, ..., W from the matrix equation EMI5.1 These third means are constituted by a second logical unit 6, in which the real and the imaginary components of Wi, where i 1, 2, ..., n, are determined separately. Splitting into real and imaginary components allows the above matrix equation to be written as EMI5.2 This matrix equation can be solved in a known manner. Logical unit 6 supplies the W. signals, consisting of two components, Re Wi and 1 1Im W . The pulse radar apparatus still further comprises fourth means to determine from signals Em, E1, E2, ..., En, delayed over the total processing time of the aforementioned steps, and from weights W1, W2, ..., Wn, the target return signals E E Em W1E1 W2E2 ... 1E , processed in the main channel. m m 11 22 nn The fourth means are constituted by a third logical unit 7. Logical unit 7 consists of multipliers 8a, Sb, ..., 8n, an adder 9 and a subtractor 10. Logical unit 7 is supplied with signals, provided these signals are delayed over a time T corresponding with the time needed for the determination of W1, W2, ..., Wn from Em, E1,E2, ..., E . The pulse radar apparatus thereto comprises delay elements 11a, 11b, ..., 11n and 12, each consisting of two parts, namely for the real and the imaginary components of the signal supplied to the delay element. Multipliers 8a, 8b, ..., 8n determine the products WiEi, i 1,2, ..., n.The quantities WiE again consist of two numerical values Re WiEi and Im WiEi .Adder 9 determines the va of two numerical values EMI6.1 this sum value also consists andEMI6.2 Subtractor 10 finally establishes the valueEMI6.3 which consists of the numerical values Re E m and Im E m . The above first, second, third and fourth means together form the digital side lobe canceller. The circuit as shown in Fig. 1 schematically is in practice useful only for small values of n, in particular when n 1 or 2. For these two cases, the digital side lobe canceller is illustrated in greater detail in Figs 2 and 3. In Fig. 2 the logical unit 4 consists of multipliers 13 to 18, adders 19 and 20 and subtractor 21. These circuits, connected as shown, supply the following output signals EMI7.1 These signals are fed to averaging circuit 5, which comprises, for each signal supplied, an adder 22 and a register 23. Iterative addition at the sampling frequency establishes, short of a scale factor, the average value of the signals supplied during a certain time. Processing of the scale factor occurs with the readout of register 23. The average values Re E1 Em , Im E1 Em and E1 2 are supplied to logical unit 6. This unit comprises two dividers, 24 and 25, connected as shown in the figure. The dividers supply the signals EMI7.2 these signals are fed to logical unit 7.Logical unit 7 comprises four multipliers, 26 29, an adder 30, and subtractors 31, 32 and 33 these circuits are connected as shown in the figure. Logical unit 7 is also supplied with signals Re Em Im Em , Re E1 v and Im E1 v these are the signals supplied to logical unit 4 after being delayed over a time corresponding with the processing time of these signals in logical unit 4, averaging circuit 5 and logical unit 6. The output signals of logical unit 7 are Re Em Re Em Re W1 .Re E1 Im W1 Im E1 J Im E Im Em v Re W, . Im E1 v Im W1 . Re E1 v Fig. 3 illustrates the digital side lobe canceller in greater detail for the case when n 2. Logical unit 4 here receives signals Re E , Im Em , Re E1 , Im E1 , Re E2 and Im E2 .Logical unit 4 comprises multipliers 34 49, adders 50 54 and subtractors 55 57, connected as shown in the figure. The output signals of logical unit 4 are EMI8.1 These signals are fed to averaging circuit 5. Circuit 5 again comprises for each signal supplied an adder 58 and a register 59, whose function is similar to that of elements 22 and 23 of Fig. 2.The output signals of averaging circuit 5 are Re E1 Em , Im E1 Em , RE E2 Em , Im E2 Em , Re E1 E2 , Im E1 E2 , E1 ê and E2 ê. These signals are fed to logical unit 6. Unit 6 comprises multipliers 60 74, combining circuits 75 79 and dividers 80 P3, connected as shown in the figure. The output signals of logical unit 6 are EMI8.2 EMI9.1 These signals are fed to logical unit 7. Unit 7 comprises multipliers 84 91, adders 92 95 and subtractors 96 99, connected as shown in the figure. Logical unit 7 is also supplied with sig nalsRe Em v Im E, V Re E1 , Im E1 v, Re E2 v and Im E2 v these are the signals fed to logical unit 4 after being delayed over a time corresponding with the processing time of these signals in logical unit 4, averaging circuit 5 and logical unit 6.The output signals of logical unit 7 are now EMI9.2 In the case when n is greater than 2, it is preferred to replace logical units 4, 6 and 7 by a programmable signal processor for implementing the process steps of the methods according to the invention under the control of a suitable program. Obviously, this program will be written on the same mathematical basis as that of the hardware described. The result of the method here described is such that the interference cancellation obtained is highly independent of the phase relations between the signals of the same interference source in the different channels. Omnidirectional antennas are utilised in the auxiliary channels should these antennas be replaced by directional antennas, each of which to be directed to an interference source, a still better interference cancellation and a still greater independence of the phase relations would be obtained.
