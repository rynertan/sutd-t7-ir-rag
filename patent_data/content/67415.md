# A process of continuous suspension polymerization.

## Abstract
A continuous suspension polymerization process is disclosed which comprises forming monomer droplets with the uniform size by a drops generator, polymerizing said droplets in an aqueous suspension medium while utilizing the difference in specific gravities between said droplets and the aqueous suspension medium as well as flow of the aqueous suspension medium, whereby only polymer parti cles polymerized to the desired conversion are recovered. The polymer particles so obtained have an uniform particle size and a narrow particle size distribution, because neither destruction nor agglomeration of said droplets by a mecha nical agitation takes place.
