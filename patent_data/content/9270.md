## Description
Method and apparatus for preparing beverages from powdered concentrates. In dosing beverages in beverage making machines, use can be made of both liquid and dry, powdered concentrates. The powdered concentrates have the great advantage that, so long as they remain dry, bacteria cannot develop therein. Preservatives are unnecessary. They have the additional advantage of cheap storage, transportation and handling.Normally, the powders are first metered by a powder dosing device to a mixing device and dissolved therein with a portion of the total quantity of water to be used in the portion of beverage. This resulting solution is supplied to a drinking cup, while the remainder of the water is directly metered to the drinking cup. In particular in the preparation of cold beverages such as soft drinks and possibly also alcohol containing drinks, such as beer the quick dissolving forms a problem. In order to make it possible for the material to be dissolved rapidly it is of importance that fine powders are used. Quick dissolving is in particular also of importance in those cases in which carbonated water is used. For the solid particles serve as nuclei for the generation of carbon dioxide gas so that the carbon dioxide content of the ready beverage deteriorates and therefore must disappear as fast as possible. The ready dissolving is also of importance to prevent caking in the apparatus.Fine powders, however, have the disadvantage of dusting . The outlet opening of the powder dosing device can be placed over the mixing device, so that the quantities dosed by this dosing device fall into the mixing device.The dusting of the fine powder entails that this spreads throughout the remainder of the machine. If the interior of the machine is protected against this dusting by providing a cap which surrounds the outlet opening of the powder dosing device, as well as the opening of the mixing device into which the powder falls, then the powder will adhere to the walls of this cap. In both cases there is the risk of caking to the wall, in particular also at the line of separation between the water supplied in the mixing device and the air. This is objectionable, in particular from a hygienic point of view bacterial growth in powder becoming moist . The present invention provide a method of preparing cold beverages in beverage makirgmachines by dissolving powdered beverage concentrates in water, in which the powder is metered by a powder dosing device to a mixing device, to which water is supplied, characterized in that there is provided a stream of air which passes the powder particles integrally from the outlet opening of the powder dosing device to the mixing device.In particular, the method according to the invention has the characteristics features that the opening of the mixing device is under the outlet opening of the powder dosing device, that in this mixing device a sub atmospheric pressure is maintained, and that the distance of the outlet opening of the powder dosing device to the opening of the mixing device, on the one hand, and the sub atmospheric pressure, on the other, are so attuned to one another that the powder issuing from the outlet opening is sucked integrally into the mixing device. Preferably, powders are used having a particle size of 0.2 mm and finer. Agglomerates of this powders are also suitable. When the method is applied to the preparation of carbonated beverages, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, first a certain amount of non carbonated water is supplied to the mixing device before a dose of carbonated water is supplied. It is thus achieved that the finest particles are dissolved before the carbonated water enters and hence can no longer act as nuclei for carbon dioxide gas generation. Splashing and loss of carbon dioxide are thus prevented. The amount of water supplied to the mixing device is normally a fraction of the water ultimately supplied to the drinking cup. A dosed portion of the water is accordingly directly supplied to the drinking cup. The mixing device then has the task of making a presolution, which is further diluted in the drinking cup. Powder dosing devices for dosing the powders in question are generally known. See for example D. Rauch Verpackungs Rundschau, 28 1977 1561 3 . In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention, the powder is subjected to a first mixing with water in a receptacle disposed under the outlet opening of the powder dosing device, whereafter the liquid is passed to a mixing chamber via a downcomer tube, said mixing chamber comprising a stirrer with a centrifugal pump function. Owing to the centrifugal pump function of the stirrer, which naturally also has a mixing and dissolving function, air is drawn from the receptacle via the downcomer tube to the mixing chamber, and a sub atmospheric pressure is generated in the space between the opening of the receptacle and the outlet opening of the powder dosing device. Normally after termination of the supply of powder, an after wash with water is used. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the receptacle is of axially symmetrical construction, and the water is supplied with a tangentially directed water jet. By virtue of this construction the powder is intimately admixed with water in the mixing device. Preferably, the receptacle has the form of a funnel. The water supplied will thus describe a helical path, which is highly conducive to intimate mixing and proper dissolving. The invention also provides apparatus for preparing beverages from powdered concentrates in beverage making machines, characterized by a combination of a mixing device for the intimate mixing of a portion of powder to be metered by a powder dosing device with water, and a device suitable for generating a stream of air between the outlet opening of the powder dosing device and the mixing device, so that the powder issuing from this outlet opening is entrained integrally by said stream of air to the mixing device. In particular, the apparatus for generating a stream of air will be constructed and disposed so that a negative pressure gradient is brought about between the outlet opening of the powder dosing device and the inlet opening of the mixing device. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the apparatus for generating the stream of air is a centrifugal pump. A suitable embodiment, furthermore, consists of a mixing device to the outlet opening of which a centrifugal pump is coupled. An apparatus with which very good results can be obtained consists of an axially symmetrical funnel shaped receptacle with a supply pipe for water disposed at the wide end in a tangential direction at a slight downward inclination of, for example 5 , a connecting tube coupled to the outlet opening of the receptacle and of the same diameter as said outlet opening, and a mixing chamber connected to the end of said tube, said mixing chamber taking the form of a centrifugal pump. In particular, the mixing chamber may have the form of a cone, the axis of which is perpendicular to the axis of the connecting.tube. It is noted tb many proposals have been made for dosing powdered beverage concentrates. In particular with regard to fine powders, however, such as are required for the preparation of cold beverages, these proposals are unsatisfactory. Reference is made, for example, to United States patent specifications 2,954,145, 116,399 and 3,300,094 and British patent specification 1,006,191. In the methods and apparatuses described in these specifications, use is made of a stream of air, it is true, but a certain portion of the fine powder sticks to the walls and or a portion of powder is removed with the air. One example of apparatus according to the invention and its operation are shown in the accompanying Figures 1, 2 and 3, in which Figure 1 is a longitudinal sectional view of the apparatus Figure 2 is a second longitudinal sectional view, at right angles to the section of Figure 1, and taken on the line II II of Figure 1 and Figure 3 is a graphic representation of a programme for a carbonated beverage. Designated by 1 is the outlet tube of a powder dosing device.The powder falls into a funnel shaped receptacle 2. Water is supplied in a powerful jet via a tangentially directed tube 3, and moves helically along the wall of receptacle 2 to a downcomer tube 4, along the inner wall of which it moves, also helically, to a mixing chamber 5. Via 6 the liquid leaves the mixing chamber 5 sideways. Chamber 5 is of conical configuration to facilitate its draining completely.The mixing chamber 5 is provided with a centrifugal stirrer 7, which is driven by a motor 8. The stirrer 7 consists of 16 blades of the shape shown in Figure 2, mounted on a shaft. The blades are curved up to their ends. At fast rotation, in this case approximately 9000 rpm, sufficient air is drawn through downcomer tube 4 to generate a subatmospheric pressure in receptacle 2. Furthermore, the stirrer ensures that the powder is fully dissolved. The sub atmospheric pressure ensures that the fine powder metered from 1 is drawn into the receptacle and downcomer tube, and dusting is prevented. A drinking cup 9 is shown diagrammatically in Figures 1 and 2, and so is the supply of replenishing water at 10. The programme for each filling is performed after the machine has been put to operation. This, and the control of the programme, are effected electrically by methods well known in the art. In the table shown in Figure 3, a programme is illustrated for a carbonated beverage. The use of non carbonated water for preparing a pre solution of the powder before the carbonated water is supplied, although normally desirable, is not required in all cases, if some loss of carbon dioxide is taken into the bargain. The stream of air for the integral entraining of the powder can also be obtained, for example, by injecting a stream of air via a venturi tube. This can be mounted, for example, on the downcomer tube 4 of Figure 2. In that case the mixing chamber 5 need not have a suction function.
