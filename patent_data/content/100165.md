# Transfer type electromagnetic relay.

## Abstract
In a transfer type electromagnetic relay comprising first and second lead members 26, 27 for first and second fixed contact studs 31, 32 , respectively, and a third lead member 28 for an armature 36 , first and second permanent ma gnets 46, 47 are directed to back surfaces of the first and the second lead members, respectively, with poles of the same name brought nearer to the respective leads. A single permanent magnet may be placed in the above mentioned manner. Preferably, first and second arm members 43a, 43b are attached to a leaf spring 37 fixed to the armature and extended from a central portion of the leaf spring on both sides thereof in directions different from each other. The leaf spring is manufactured without any bend and is therefore substantially flat. The third lead member partially comprises a non magnetic portion at a center area thereof to support the armature. In order to provide make before break contacts, an armature height is rendered lower than a sum of a fixed contact height and a movable contact height given by each fixed contact stud and each movable contact stud.
