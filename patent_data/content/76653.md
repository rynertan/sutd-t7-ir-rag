The resulting solid substance was separated and washed three times, each time with 200 ml of n hexane at 650C.Treatment with titanium tetrachloride To the solid substance was added 100 ml of titanium tetrachloride. After stirring at 900C for 3 hours, excess titanium tetrachloride was removed. Subsequently, the solid substance was filtered out at 900C, and the filtered solid substance was washed six times, each time with 200 ml of n hexane at 650C, followed by drying in vacuo at 500C for 1 hour to yield 10.4 g of a catalyst component containing 4.9X of titanium and having a specific surface area of 342 m2 g and a pore volume of 0.34 cc g.Application Example 1 Polymerization of ethylene Into a 1.5 liter stainless steel SUS 32 autoclave equipped with a stirrer were charged in a nitrogen atmosphere 12.15 mg of the catalyst component obtained in Example 1, 0.7 mmol of triisobutyl aluminum, and 390 g of isobutane. The polymerization system was heated to 85 C. Hydrogen was introduced into the autoclave to the extent that the partial pressure of hydrogen reached 2.0 kg cm2. Ethylene was introduced to the extent that the ethylene partial pressure reached 5.0 kg cm2. Ethylene was supplied continuously to carry out polymerization for 60 minutes while keeping constant the total pressure of.the polymerization system. After completion of polymerization, the solvent and unreacted ethylene were purged and white powdery polymer was collected.The polymer was dried at 700C for 10 hours in vacuo. Thus, 224 g of polyethylene powder having an MI of 0.35 and a bulk density of 0.37 g cc was obtained. The catalytic activity Kc was 18,440 and the specific catalytic activity was 3,690. Application Examples 2 to 6Polymerization of Ethylene Ethylene was polymerized as in Application Example 7 except that the catalyst components obtained in Examples 2 to 6 were used. The results are shown in Table 1.Application Example 7Polymerization of Ethylene Ethylene was polymerized as in Application Example 1 except that 21.1 mg of the catalyst component obtained in ReferentialExample was used. The results are shown in Table 1.
