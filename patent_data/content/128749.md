# SPHERICAL VALVE LOCK VALVE SPRING RETAINER ASSEMBLY TO MINIMIZE VALVE GUIDE SIDE LOADS

## Abstract
A valve lock valve spring retainer assembly where the valve lock and valve retainer mating surfaces are spherical. The spherical valve lock valve spring retainer mating surface per mits small rotations of the valve spring retainer with respect to the plane perpendicular to the valve stem. This significantly re duces valve spring generated side loads on the valve guides.
