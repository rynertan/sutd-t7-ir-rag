# FIBER OPTIC CONNECTOR

## Abstract
A connector for a fiber optic cable securely retains the optical fiber without the use of adhesives, and uses a basic as sembly step to simultaneously retain the optical fiber. In a first embodiment, the step of crimping a crimping ferrule to retain strength fiber members of the fiber optic cable simultaneously collapses a portion of the connector to securely retain the opti cal fiber in the connector. In a second embodiment of the in vention, the step of inserting an inner member into the connec tor body causes an end portion to collapse, securely retaining the optical fiber, and may also cause an intermediate portion of the inner member to collapse, securely retaining a buffer or in ner jacket layer. Such a fiber optic connector may be made ei ther entirely of metal, or of plastic, without substantial structu ral modification, as appropriate for use in its intended environ ment.
