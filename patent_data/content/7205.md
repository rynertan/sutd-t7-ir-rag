## Description
OPTICALLY ACTIVE PHENETHANOLAMINES, THEIR FORMULATIONS, USE AND PREPARATION This invention relates to certain extraordinarily potent inotropic agents, to pharmaceutical formulations containing those compounds, to the use of the compounds in conditioning cardiovascular systems and to their preparation. Some of the most extensive efforts in basic research have been in the area of D phenylethylamine aerivatives, many of which are catecholamines. Such compounds are known to have a variety of pharmacological activities. For example, the naturally occurring catecholamine epinephrine is a potent sympathomimetic drug and a powerful cardiac stimulant. However, epinephrine has found only limited utility in restoring cardiac function in cases of cardiac arrest, oven though it is one of the most potent vasopressor arugs known, and greatly increases systolic blood pressure.Like most drugs of its class, the use of epinephrine is limited due to its undesirable side effects, which include fear, anxiety, tremor, tenseless, throbbing headache, increased blood pressure, dizziness, respiratory difficulty an palpitaticn as well as its short duration of action. Other drugs similar to epinephrine both in structure and physiological properties include two other natural catecholamines, norepinephrine and dopamine, as well as isoproterenol, a synthetic drug. Such sympatr√≤rnirnetic agentsc2rrently are used to restore contractility in cardiogenic shock. However, like other drugs of this class, these agents have side effects which are life threatening, thus greatly inhibiting their clinical usefulness. Certain catecholamines have been found to exert a positive inotropic effect on heart muscle without the detrimental side effect of significant increase in heart rate or distortion of cardiac rhythm or blood pressure. U.S. Patent No. 3,987,200 discloses a method of increasing cardiac contractility utilizing compounds such as dl 3,4 dihydroxy N 3 4 hydroxyphenyl 1 methyl n propyl ss phenethyl amine hydrochloride, now generically referred to as dobutamine. Dobutamine is well suited for treating myocardial infarction with failure, congestive heart failure, cardiac by pass surgery and traumatic surgery.However, like most other catechol derivatives, it is rapidly inactivated in a biological system by the actions of catechol O methyl transferase. Dobutamine and its related drugs thus are restricted to intravenous infusion in hospitalized patients. Even though numerous compounds which have inotropic properties are known, the use of such compounds is severely limited due to their accompanying undesirable side effects and rapid metabolic inactivation. In many cases the treatment of congestive heart failure can only be effectively accomplished with the use of digitalis and allied cardiac glycosides.The main pharmacodynamic activity of digitalis is its ability to increase the force of myccardal contrac tion. Digitalis is thus widely used in the treatment of cardiac failure. Whilst digitalis and its related glycosides are widely used, they remain some of the most dangerous drugs employed. All digitalis type preparations are toxic at high dose levels. Digitalis toxicity in the heart can be lethal, most of digitalis poisoning being due to the cumulative effect of maintenance doses taken over a relatively long period of time, or from the use of a large dose in the treatment of severe atrial arrhythmias. The Applicants have now discovered that surprisingly, the positive inotropic activity of a specific class of phenethanolamines resides almost exclusively in one optical isomer, whilst other nontarget biological effects are attributable to the other optically active isomers. This invention therefore provides a means of treating conditions of depressed cardiac contractility utilizing optically active phenethanolamine derivatives which are positive inotropic agents substantially devoid of other biological properties. An object of this invention therefore is te provision of novel compounds which are positive inotropic agents but which cause little or no undesirable side effects. A further object is to provide a method for treating heart failure utilizing compounds which are direct acting, have an immediate onset of activity, and are not rapidly inactivated when administered to a biological system. The compounds of this invention provide a low risk of arrhythmia and do not cause vasoconstriction. A further object of this invention is to provide an acceptable alternative to digitalis therapy. The invention is concerned with certain phenethanolamine derivatives which are particularly useful in the treatment of conditions of depressed cardiac contractility, to pharmaceutical formulations containing such phenethanolamines, and to a method of treating conditions of depressed cardiac contractility, i.e. inadequate pumping function, as well as a method for physically conditioning a biological system.More particularly, the invention provides optically active positive inotropic agents which are phenethanolamine derivatives having the general structural formula I EMI4.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen or fluorine R2 is hydrogen or hydroxy R3 is hydrogen, hydroxy, fluorine, aminocarbonyl, methylaminocarbonyl, methoxycarbonyl or acetoxy C and C both are asymmetric carbon atoms having the R absolute stereochemical configuration with the limitation that at least one of R1 and R2 is hydrogen and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. A preferred group of compounds provided by this invention have the above formula wherein R3 is hydrogen, hydroxy, fluorine, aminocarbonyl, methylaminocarbonyl or methoxycarbonyl. Another preferred group of compounds have the above formula wherein R2 is hydroxy and R3 is hydroxy, aminocarbonyl or methoxycarbonyl. The most preferred compounds of the invention have the above formula wherein Rl is hydrogen R2 is hydrogen or 4 hydroxy and R3is 4 hydroxy or 4 aminocarbonyl and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. A further embodiment of this invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a phenethanolamine of formula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, associated with at least one pharmaceutical diluent or carrier therefor. An especially preferred formulation comprises the compound R,R N 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl l methyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylaminium chloride in combination with any of a number of pharmaceutically acceptable diluents. Such formulation is particularly well suited to adwinistrztion in a buccal dosage forx or via the transderrtial, oral or rectal routes. Yet another embodiment of this invention is a method for physically conditioning a biological system by administering an effective dose of a compound having the above general formula. According to such method, a subject can experience the beneficial effects of physical exercise by the administration of an effective dose of a Found of this invention and thereby obviate the actual physical work. The compounds provided by this invention are defined by the above general formula. While such compounds are referred to generally as phenethanolamines, they will be named systematically as propylamine derivatives, specifically as N 2 phenyl or substituted phenyl 2 hydroxyethyl l nethyl 3 substituted phenyl propylamines. As shown in the above formula, the compounds of this invention have two asymmetric carbon atoms, defined in the formula asC and C. The compounds provided by this invention are those optically active isomers having the above formula tn which both asymmetric carbon atoms are of the R absolute stereochemical configuration.A complete discussion of absolute stereochemical con figuration and nomenclature is presented by Cahn et al. in Experientia, Vol. XII, pp. 81 124 195 The stereochemical configuration of the two asymmetric carbon atoms in the compounds of this invention are designated first when naming the compounds provided herein. Accordingly, a typical compound of this invention will be named as R,R N 2 4 hydroxy phenyl 2 hydroxyethyl l methyl 3 4 aminocarbonyl phenyl propylamine. The compounds of this invention can be prepared by any of a number of art recognized synthetic routes utilizing readily available starting materials.One such process comprises coupling an optically active mandelic acid derivative with an optically active l methyl 3 substituted phenyl propylamine to provide an amide, which upon subsequent reduction provides an amine of this invention. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a process for preparing a compound of formula I which comprises reducing a compound of formula EMI7.1 where R1 R2 and R3 are as defined above, and M is hydrogen or a protecting group, followed in the case where M is not hydrogen by removal of the protecting group by hydrolysis. The intermediate amide can be prepared by reaction of a phenylpropylamine with a hydroxy pro tected mandeLic acid halide, or preferably by direct coupling reactions utilizing art recognized peptide coupling agents such as N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC , carbonyldiimidazole, N ethyl 5 phenylisoxazolinium 3 sulfonate and N ethoxycarbonyl 2 ethoxy 1,2dihydroquinoline, commonly referred to as EEDQ.Accelerators such as l hydroxybenzotriazole can be utilized in the coupling reaction if desired. In a typical coupling reaction, an optically active mandelic acid such as R 2 3 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyacetic acid is mixed with approximately equimolar quantities of an optically active phenylpropylamine such asR 1 methyl 3 3 fluorophenyl propylamine, and a coupling agent such as DCC or EEDQ. The reaction generally is carried out in a solvent such as benzene, dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, or the like, and at a temperature of about 300C. to about 100 C. Under such conditions the reaction routinely is substantially complete within from about 2 to about 48 hours. The product, an amide, is readily isolated by simply filtering the reaction mixture and then removing the reaction solvent by evaporation. The amide so formed next is reduced at the amide functionality to afford a compound of this invention. Such reduction can be accomplished by reaction of the amide with a common reducing agent such as diborane. For example, an amide such as R,R N lZ 3 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxs 1 oxoethyl 1 methyl 3 3 fluorophenyl propylamine can be reacted with an equimolar quantity or an excess of diborane in an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, benzene, toluene, diethyl ether, dichloromethane or the like.The reaction typically is carried out at a temperature of about OOC. to about 600C., and normally is complete within about 6 to about 72 hours. Any excess diborane can be decomposed by the addition of an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol and an acid such as hydrochloric acid. The product amine is readily recovered by removal of the reaction solvent by evaporation, and further purification of the product can be accomplished by standard methods such as chromatography, crystallization, salt formation, and the like. The compounds of this invention can alternatively be prepared directly by the reaction of a styrene oxide, preferably an optically active styrene oxide, with an optically active l methyl 3 phenylpropylamine. For instance, a styrene oxide such asR 2 fluorostyrene oxide can be reacted with about an equimolar quantity of an amine such as R l methyl 3 4 methylaminocarbonylphenyl propylamine in an inert organic solvent such as ethanol, dioxane, toluene or dimethylformamide. The reaction generally is carried out at a temperature of about 50 to about 1200C., and at such temperature the reaction routinely is complete in about 6 to 10 hours. The product, an optically active compound of this invention, is readily isolated by simply removing the reaction solvent, and further purification may be accomplished if desired by normal methods, including chromatography and crystallization. This reaction can be schematically illustrated by the following reaction schedule EMI10.1 where R1, R2 and R3 are as previously defined. The optically active gamines of formula IV are novel and are provided in a further aspect of the invention. They can be prepared from the corresponding ketones of formula EMI10.2 by reaction with a methylbenzylamine in the presence of an acid such as toluenesulfonic acid to provide the corresponding R N methylbenzyl 1 methyl 3 R3 phenyl propylimine. Reduction of this imine with Raney nickel gives EMI11.1 The above amine is salified, for example with HC5, and the salt purified by repeated crystallization from a suitable organic solvent. The optically active R,R N a methylbenzyl l methyl 3 R3 phenyl propylaminium salt thus obtained can then be hydrogenated with palladium on charcoal to remove the a methylbenzyl group and liberate the amine of formula IV in salt form. Yet another method for preparing compounas of this invention comprises reacting an optically active R l methyl 3 substituted phenyl propylamine with a benzoylmethyl alkylating agent such as a benzoylmethyl halide. Such alkylation reaction affords an N benzoylmethyl 3 phenylpropylamine derivative. The latter compound is reduced conventionally for instance by catalytic hydrogenation to afford a compound of this invention.For example, reaction of a compound such as R l methyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylamine with an alkylating agent such as 3hydroxybenzoylmethyl bromide, following normal alkylation procedures, provides R N 2 3 hdroxy phenyl 2 oxoethyl 1 methyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylainine. Reduction of the oxo group of the latter compound, for instance by reaction with sodium borohydride or by catalytic hydrogenation, provides a mixture of R,R N 2 3 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl methyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propyl amine and the corresponding S,R optical isomer.Separation of such diastereomers can be achieved by routine methods including chromatography. Alternatively, the mixture of such diastereomers can be utilized as such according to this invention since theS,R isomers are substantially devoid of biological activity. A preferred group of compounds provided by this invention are those phenethanolamines having the above general formula in which one or both of the phenyl rings bear a hydroxyl group. When preparing such phenethanolamines which have one or more phenolic hydroxyl groups, it may be desirable to derivatize such groups so as to protect them during chemical reactions, thus avoiding any interference which might be caused by a free phenolic hydroxyl group. Phenolic hydroxyl groups can be protected with any of a number of commonly used hydroxyl protecting groups. The use of such groups is described in detail by E. Haslam inProtective Groups In Organic Chemistry, J.F.W. McOmie,Ed., Plenum Press, New York, N.Y. 1973, Chapter 3.Examples of commonly used protecting groups include ether forming groups such as benzyl, methyl, methoxymethyl, trimethylsilyl ester forming groups such as acetate, benzoate, 2,2, 2 trichloroacetate, phenylsulfonate, and related groups. A typical example of the preparation of a phenethanolamine of this invention wherein one or both of R2 and R3 are hydroxy includes as a first step the preparation of a protected hydroxy phenyl propylamine derivative. For instance, a compound such as methyl 2 3 hydroxyphenyl ethyl ketone can be reacted with benzyl chloride under normal alkylation conditions to provide methyl 2 3 benzyloxyphenyl ethyl ketone. The ketone is reacted with ammonia to provide an imine, which then is reduced to afford the propylamine, namely 1 methyl 3 3 benzyloxyphenyl propylamine. The amine is resolved according to standard procedures to provide the optically active R isomer. The R l methyl 3 3 benzyloxyphenyl propylamine is next coupled to an optically active mandelic acid derivative such as R 2 4 benzyloxyphenyl 2 hydroxy acetic acid.The product of such coupling reaction is the corresponding amide, R,R N 12 4 benzyloxyphenyl 2 hydroxy l oxoethyl l methyl 3 3 benzyloxyphenyl propylamine. Reduction of the amide carbonyl group by reaction with diborane or a similar reducing agent affords a doubly protected phenethanolamine. The two benzyl protecting groups are readily removed by hydrogenation in the presence of Raney Nickel, thereby affording a compound of this invention, namely R,R N 12 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 1 methyl 3 3 hydroxyphenyl propylamine. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of preparing a compound of formula I in which R2 and orR3 is hydroxy which comprises deprotecting a compound of formula V EMI14.1 where R1 is as previously defined and Q1 and Q2 are the same or different hydroxy protecting groups, or one of Q1 and Q2 is hydrogen. The nature of such protecting groups will be well known to those skilled in the art. In the case of doubt, recourse may be made to the standard treatise Protective Groups in organic Chemistry mentioned above. Q1 and Q2 are preferably benzyl groups capable of removable by standard hydrogenolysis conditions. Since the compounds of this invention are phenethanolamine derivatives, they are basic in nature by virtue of the amino group. As such, the compounds are capable of forming salts with any of a number of inorganic and organic acids. An additional embodiment cf this invention encompasses the pharmaceutically acceptable salts formed by reaction of a phenethanolamine of the above general formula with an acid. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salt as used herein refers to those phenethanolamine acid addition salts which can be utilized in a biological system without imparting undesirable side effects attributable to the particular acid utilized to form the salt. While the identity of the particular acid used to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt is not critical, the salt which is formed utilizing such acid must be pharmaceutically acceptable.Acids commonly utilized to form salts according to this invention include mineral acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, sulfuric, perchloric, nitric, and related acids. Routinely used organic acids include acetic, butyric, citric, maleic, succinic, fumaric, lactic, methanesulfonic, p toluenesulfonic, and similar organic acids. Like most amine salts, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts comprehended by this invention are characteristically highly crystalline solids, and thus lend themselves to ready purification by recrystallization from common solvents such as ethanol, methanol, acetone, water, and the like. As will be described more fully hereinbelow, the phenethanolamine salts of the invention are often preferred as medicaments since they are easily formulated for convenient oral or parenteral administration. It will of course be recognized that a phenethanolamine acid addition salt can readily be converted to the free amine simply by reaction with a base such as aqueous sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or sodium carbonate. In an effort to further illustrate the various phenethanolamines comprehended by this invention, the following list of typical compounds is provided. R,R N 2 3 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl l methyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylamine R,R N 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl l methyl 3 3 hydroxyphenyl propylamine R,R N 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 1 methyl 3 3 methoxycarbonylphenyl propylamine R,R N 2 2 fluorophenyl 2 hydroxyethyl l methyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylamine R,R N 2 2 fluorophenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 1 methyl 3 4 methoxycarbonylphenyl propylamine R,R N 2 2 fluorophenyl 2 hydroxyethyl l methyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylamine R,R N 2 3 hydroxyyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 1 methyl 3 3 methoxycarbonylphenyl propylamine R,R N 2 phenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 1 methyl 3 4 methylaminocarbonylphenyl propylamine R,R N 2 4 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 1 methyl 3 4 methoxycarbonylphenyl propylamine R,R N 2 3 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl l methyl 3 4 fluorophenyl propylamine R,R N 2 2 fluorophenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 1 methyl 3 4 aminocarbonylphenyl propylamine R,R N 2 2 fluorophenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 1 methyl 3 4 methylaminocarbonylphenyl propylamine R,R N 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 1 methyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylaminium bromide R,R N 2 phenyl 2 hydroxyethyl l methyl 3 4 aminocarbonylpropyl propylaminium acetate R,R N 2 2 fluorophenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 1 methyl 3 4 aminocarbonylphenyl propylaminium chloride R,R N 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl l methyl 3 3 hydroxyphenyl propylaminium oxolate R,R N 2 3 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl l methyl 3 4 methoxycarbonylphenyl propylaminium phosphate R,R N 2 3 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl l methyl 3 4 methylaminocarbonylphenyl propylaminium benzoate R,R N 2 2 fluorophenyl 2 hydroxyethyl l methyl 3 phenylpropylaminium p2ra toluenesulfonate R,R N 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 1 methyl 3 4 aminocarbonylphenyl propylaminium phosphate R,R N 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl l methyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylaminium naphthalene sulfonate R,R N 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 1 methyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylaminium isobutyrate R,R N 2 3 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 1 methyl 3 4 aminocarbonylphenyl propylaminium picrate R,R N 2 2 fluorophenyl 2 hydroxyethyl l methyl 3 4 methoxycarbonylphenyl propylaminium bromide and R,R N 2 3 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 1 methyl 3 4 fluorophenyl propylaminium para bromophenylsulfonate. Additional aspects of this invention include a method for treating conditions of depressed cardiac contractility, a method for physically conditioning a biological system, and a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a phenethanolamine of the general formula I in ccmbination with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier or diluent therefor. The compounds of this invention are uniquely active in effecting an increase in cardiac pumping force while not imparting the adverse conditions generally observed with the use of currently known cardiac drugs. In other words, the compounds of this invention are effective in increasing cardiac contractility while causing neither a substantial drop in blood pressure nor a substantial change in heart rate.The compounds of this invention are additionally unique in pharmacological properties due to their immediate onset, they are direct acting, they do not cause vasoconstriction, they cause little or no central nervous system effects, and they provide a low risk of arrhythmia. Because the compounds comprehended by this invention have unique biological effects, it has been found that they can be used to physically condition z subject. The term physically conditioning as used herein is synonymous with increasing oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle. It now is widely recognized that physical training benefits people with occlusive peripheral or coronary artery disease. The result of such physical exercising is that skeletal muscle adapts in such a way that it can make better use of available blood flow. From the physiologic standpoint, physical training causes an increase in the number or size, or both, of mitochondria, thereby enhancing tbte ability of skeletal muscle to utilize oxygen. This in turn permits the muscle to do more work on the same or lesser amount of blood flow. Therefore, a restriction of blood flow caused by a diseased artery supplying the skeletal muscle becomes less of a handicap. Moreover, since less blood flcw is required by skeletal muscle, the demands on the heart are decreased so that the heart s need for blood flow is also reduced. Additionally, a restriction of blood flow caused by obstructive coronary artery disease in the heart becomes less of a handicap. A further benefit occurring with physical training is a decrease in heart rate. Heart rate determines the number of times per minute that the heart develops blood pressure, and naturally a decrease in heart rate lowers the requirement for cardiac blood flow. Surprisingly, the compounds provided by this invention cause the same cardiovascular adaptations as does physical training, namely increased oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle, reduced cardiac blood flow requirements and a significant reduction in heart rate, both at rest and during physical activity such as walking and running.The compounds provided herein thus represent a significant advance in the art, since many of the people who need physical training the most are unable to exercise because of physical handicaps, arthritis, or peripheral vascular disease or existing heart disease such that exercise may either precipitate or exacerbate symptoms of heart failure. By chronic treatment with a compound of this invention, the effects of physical conditioning can be realized. According to the present method of treating heart failure, a dose effective for increasing cardiac contractility of a compound having the above formula is administered to a subject suffering from heart failure due to a condition of depressed cardiac contractility and inadequate ventricular function or inadequate pumping function or to a subject suspected of developing heart failure due to conditions of inadequate cardiac pumping function. The compounds can be formulated for convenient oral, topical, rectal or parenteral administration, and typically are administered in the form of a non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The particular route of administration may vary according to the particular condition and subject to be treated. In cases of severe heart failure due to acutely depressed cardiac contractility, it ma be desirable to administer a phenethanolamine of this invention intravenously until the pumping function is improved, at which time the patient can be maintained by intramuscular cr oral administration. Additionally, the compounds of this invention can be formulated for administration via buccal seals, by sublingual lozenges, by rectal suppositories, by metered aerosols and by dermal application. These latter named routes of administration are particularly preferred in the prophylactic treatment of inadequate ventricular function for which the compounds of this invention are well suited. For intravenous administration according to the method of treatment of this invention, an optically active phenethanolamine of the above general formula is administered at the rate of about 0.01 to about 10 mcg. kg. min. until the contractile force of the heart muscle is restored. The infusion at such rate is continued until the subject shows signs of relief, at which time the rate of infusion can be decreased, for example to a rate of about 0.01 to about 10 mcg. kg. l0 minutes, or as needed. Maintenance therapy can be accomplished if desired by the intramuscular injection of from about 5 to about 90 mcg. kg. of body weight at intervais of from about one to four times per day, or as required by the severity of the cardiac condition being treated as well as the tolerance displayed by the patient.Maintenance therapy also is conveniently accomplished by oral administration of capsules containing sufficient quantity of a compound of this invention so that the effective dose is from about 5 to about 90 mcg. kg. of body weight. Since the acid addition salts of the phenethanolamine bases of the above formula are characteristically highly soluble in water, it is preferred that oral administration is carried out utilizing formulations containing a phenethanolamine in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. For example, a particularly preferred method of treatment according to this invention comprises administering a dose effective for increasing the pumping force of a heart muscle of R, R N 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyli 1 methyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylamine as the hydrochloride salt.Such compound is ideally administered orally, sublingually, rectally or dermally at a dose of from about 5 to about 150 mcg. kg. to a subject suffering from heart failure, or prophylactically to a subject suspected of developing heart failure due to conditions of inadequate heart pumping function. As already pointed out, an additional embodiment of this invention is a method for physically conditioning a subject by administering an effective dose of a phenethanolamine of this invention. Such method accomplishes the physiological effects of physical exercise in subjects unable or unwilling to attain such conditioning by actual physical training.According to such method, a compound of this invention is administered to a subject at a dose of about 5 mcg. kg. to about 200 mcg. kg. Preferably, the compound is initially administered at a relativel low dose, for instance from about 5 to about 10 mcg. kg., at intervals of once or twice each day for about one or two weeks. The effective dose then is increased to a dose of about 10 to about 20 mcg. kg. once or twice each day for about one or two weeks. The drug dose is then again increased at regular intervals until the maximum degree of physical conditioning is experienced without an adverse increase in heart rate. For example, such dose build up procedure can be carried out by administering effective amounts of a compound such as R, R N 2 phenyl 2 hydroxyethyl l methyl 3 4 aminocarbonylphenyl propylaminium bromide.Such administration is preferably carried out orally at an initial dose of about 10 mcg. kg. Alternatively, such compound can be administered dermally in the form of a cream at an initial dose of about 1.0 to about 20 mg. kg. The dosage, by whichever route selected, is gradually increased until the desired degree of conditioning of the biological system is established.The oral administration of a compound such as R,R N 2 phenyl 2 hydroxyethyl l methyl 3 4 aminocar bonylphenyl propylaminium bromide may reach, for instance, an upper oral limit of about 60 to about 90 mcg. kg. given from one to about four times each day.Such dosage will be continued as needed to maintain the desired effects of physical conditioning. Such maintenance therapy may be accomplished by the admin istration of the drug in the amount of about 60 to about 90 mcg. kg. from about one to four times per week as required. The compounds of this invention can be formulated by any of a number of commonly used methods for convenient administration by routes such as orally, intravenously, intramuscularly, dermally, sublingually, rectally, via aerosols, buccal seals, and the like. Such pharmaceutical formulations are a further embodiment of this invention. A phenethanolamine of the invention, as the free base or acid addition salt, can be admixed with commonly used diluents and carriers, including starch powder, sucrose, dextrose, cellulose fiber, sorbitol, mannitol, propylene glycol, liquid paraffin, calcium silicate, silica, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cocoa butter, methyl cellulose, methyl hydroxybenzoate, ethyl lactate, sorbitan trioleate and related excipients and carriers.The formulations of this invention can additionally contain more than one active ingredient of this invention, as well as the pharmacologically less inotropicly active isomers such as the S,R isomers. Such formulations generally will contain from about 0.1 to about 10 percent by weight of active ingredient. The formulated phenethanolamines can be encapsulated by an ingestible carrier in the form of a capsule, sachet, cachet, buccal seal, or the like, thus providing for convenient oral administration.Alternatively the formulations can be molded into tablets in unit dosage form. For intravenous administration, the formulated phenethanoiamine is best dissolved in a suitable solvent such as isotonic saline or glucose or sterile water. The phenethanolamines provided by this invention have been evaluated for their inotropic potency in anesthetized dogs and in conscious dogs with implanted cardiovascular transducers. The heart rate, arterial pressure, cardiac output, and the derivative of left ventricular pressure which is the index of cardiac contractility , were measured. The compounds provided by this invention proved to be strongly inotropic, direct acting with immediate onset and adequate duration of action, and have displayed no alpha receptor activity. As hereinbefore pointed out, this invention comprehends optically active R,Rphenethanolamines of the above formula, since the R,S isomers are substantially devoid of inotropic activity. The R,S isomers are, however, effective in inducing the loss of adipose tissue in obese animals without imparting cardiac effects and are therefore useful as anti obesity drugs. The unique and unexpected separation in pharmacological activity between the R,R phenethanolamines of this invention and the R,S isomers is illustrated in Table I.

The maximal increase achieved with the indicated dose was approximately 45 . The compounds provided herein also have been evaluated as physical conditioning agents. In a typical experiment, a group of ten dogs were implanted with miniature pressure transducers in their left ventricle so that measurements of heart rate, systolic pressure and the derivative of left ventricular pressure the index of cardiac contractility could be made. The dogs were trained to walk on a treadmill.Five of the dogs were randomly selected to receive a compound of this invention, for instance R,R N 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 1 methyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylaminium chloride. The test animals received saline filled capsules during the first week of the test. During the second and third weeks, the dogs received the test compound orally at a dose of 10 mcg. kg. twice each day. The dosage was increased to 40 mcg. kg. twice each day for the fourth week, and increased to 60 mcg. kg. twice each day through weeks five to eleven. The other five dogs received saline filled capsules throughout the study.Once each week, the animals response to exercise on the treadmill was evaluated. Resting data were obtained by permitting the dogs to lie on the treadmill before turning it on. The treadmill then was run at a speed of 3.5 kilometers hr., with the dogs walking at this speed with no elevation for 5 min., and then for 5 min. at a 20 incline. During the eleventh week of such test, the dogs were made to walk on a 408 incline, thus providing sufficient stress to increase plasma lactic acid and catecholamines. Blood samples prior to each exercise and within two minutes of completing the exercise were taken from the jugular vein. After several weeks, the dogs were anesthetized and measurements of ventricular function and skeletal muscle blood flow and enzymes were made. The results demonstrated that, for the placebo treated dogs, no significant change in heart rate occurred during the course of the experiment, whereas the heart rate both while resting and while exercising was significantly reduced in the dogs conditioned with a compound of this invention. Moreover, skeletal muscle blood flow was significantly reduced, because the muscle s capacity to utilize oxygen was significantly enhanced as demonstrated by a significantly enhanced activity of succinic dehydrogenase. Further evidence of the compound s conditioning effect was obtained by measuring circulating lactic acid and norepinephrine.During exercise on the treadmill, lactic acid and norepinephrine blood concentrations were significantly lower in the dogs conditioned with a compound of this invention than in those cases where the dogs received only placebc. These results are presented in TableII. Because of the ability of the compounds of this invention to effect the same result in a biological system which is accomplished by physical exercise, the compounds can be used to physically condition an animal unable or unwilling to physically exercise, and can be used to further physically condition an animal which undergoes physical exercise.Ideally, the pure R,R isomers of this invention are administered at a dose of about 5 to about 90 mcg. kg, from 1 to 4 times per day to a human desirous of becoming physically conditioned. It may be economically desirable to utilize all four optical isomers as a mixture in the conditioning of animals such as racing dogs and horses.
