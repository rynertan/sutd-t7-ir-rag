# Automotive internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
An automotive internal combustion engine 20 having a transmission comprises a cylinder block 22 having at its bottom section a plurality of main bearing supporting sections. For effectively suppressing the angular displacement of the cylinder block 22 relative to the transmission bell housing, a bearing beam structure 42 is secured to the cylinder block bottom section and includes a plurality of main bearing cap sections 44 associated each one with each main bearing supporting section 45 of the cylinder block, whereas a beam section 46 securely connects the main bearing cap sections with each other, and a support arm section 52 is integral with an end portion of the bearing beam structure and rigidly connected to the lower section of the transmission bell housing.
