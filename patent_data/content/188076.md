# INTEGRATED CIRCUITS INCORPORATING A SELF TESTING CAPABILITY

## Abstract
An integrated circuit having a built in self test design, the integrated circuit including a combinatorial logic circuit CLB , a first register means BN coupled to an output of the combinatorial logic circuit CLB and a feedback path 14 via which output signals from the first register means BN are fed back to an input of the combinatorial logic circuit CLB . The present invention provides a multiplexer M coupled between the first register means BN and the feedback path 14 , and second register means BT responsive to a signal which is originated to initiate a test function for feeding test signals via the multiplexer M and the feedback path 14 to the input of the combinatorial logic circuit CLB ..
