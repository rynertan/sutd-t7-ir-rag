# CAMSHAFT MANUFACTURING PROCESS

## Abstract
A camshaft manufacturing process wherein a camshaft is cast from a heat treatable gray cast iron having a high carbide microstructure, is annealed while retaining the carbides and then cooled to room temperature. Surfaces, such as cam lobe surfaces, are then surface hardened and the camshaft may thereafter be machined. The heat treating process comprises heating the camshaft at 1600 F 871 C in about twenty minutes, holding the camshaft at 1600 F 871 C for about twenty minutes and thereafter heat treating the camshafts at a temperature of 1600 to 1640 F 871 to 893 C for about eighty minutes. The camshaft are then cooled rapidly to about 400 F 204 C , for example, within about an hour and a half, and thereafter air cooled.
