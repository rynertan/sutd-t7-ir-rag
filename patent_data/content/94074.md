# Welding apparatus with monitor means.

## Abstract
A welding apparatus with monitor means including a weld ing torch 1 having an electrode 3 located in the vicinity of its forward end and supported at its rearward portion by a welding head 2 for rotational movement about its longitudinal axis and back and forth reciprocatory movement along the longi tudinal axis. The welding torch further includes an electric con ductor 13 covered at its outer periphery with an insulator 14 and formed with a gas sump 17 in the vicinity of the electrode. The electric conductor has defined therein a gas supply pas sageway 16 for supplying gas shield gas, a bore for allowing an image guide 4 and a light guide 5 to extend there through, and a bore 23 for allowing a fluid to flow there through to cool the electric conductor. The image guide and light guide have their forward ends located in the gas sump, so that they can command a view of outside through guide open ings 19, 20 serving concurrently as gas ejecting ports for ejecting the shield gas therethrough. A filter is located at the other end of the image guide, and an industrial television cam era 7 and a television receiver 9 are mounted for converting optical images formed on the filter to television pictures to en able monitoring of welding operations to be effected.
