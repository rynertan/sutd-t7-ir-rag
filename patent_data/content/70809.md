# ADJUSTMENT TO DESIRED VALUE TRIMMING ON THIN FILM RESISTORS BY ION SPUTTERING

## Abstract
A technique for adjusting to the desired value, thin film integrated resistors is made known. This method consists in exposing a resistor, whose thickness is greater than that neces sary for the desired resistance, to ionic sputtering of the resistive material until a the resistor thickness is such as to correspond to the desired electric resistance. Ion sputter etching is realised iether by means of a plasma or by means of an ion gun.
