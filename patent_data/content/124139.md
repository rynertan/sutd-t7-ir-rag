# Semi conductor device with increased break down voltage.

## Abstract
At least one annular region 11, 12, . . . extends around an active device region 10 and is located within the spread of a depletion layer 25 from a reverse biased p n junction 20 formed by the device region 10 to increase the break down voltage of the junction 20 . The device region 10 and or at least one inner annular region 11, 12, . . . in cludes at least one shallower portion 10b, 11b, . . . which extends laterally outwards from a deep portion 10a, 11a, 12a, . . . and faces the surrounding annular region to change the spacing and depth relationship of these regions. This permits high punch through voltages to be achieved between the regions 10, 11, 12, . . . while reducing peak fields at the bottom outer corners of the regions 10, 11, 12, . . . . Inwardly extending shallow portions 11c, 12c, . . . may also be included. The shallow portions 10b, 11b 11c, 12c . . . may extend around the whole of a perimeter of the region or be localised where higher electrostatic fields may occur around the perimeter.
