## Description
Thyristor The present invention relates to thyristors, and more particularly to an improved thyristor structure which greatly improves photosensitivity, yet still prevents the critical rate of rise of off state voltage dv dt from being exceeded. p and n type layers are alternately formed in a four layered semiconductor crystal structure.Generally, the four layers consist of a p type emitter layer, an n type base layer, a p type base layer and an n type emitter layer. An anode electrode is deposited on the p type emitter layer which is the lowermost layer. A cathode electrode is deposited on the n type emitter layer which is the uppermost layer. A gate electrode is deposited on the upper surface part of the p type base layer adjacent to the cathode electrode.In the thyristor having the above configuration, when a trigger signal is applied to the gate electrode of the p type base layer, a small area near the gate electrode is rendered conductive. This area expands to the entire area of the junction of the thyristor over time.When the critical rate of rise of on state current di dt is great during triggering, the current is concentrated only at a limited conductive area in the vicinity of the gate electrode, resulting in thermal breakdown due to a local temperature increase. Along with the trend towards thyristors of higher dielectric strength and larger capacitance, a higher critical rate of rise of on state current di dt is desired without adversely affecting the thyristor 5 operation, while still maintaining thé value of the gate control current be as small as possible. However, if a higher critical rate of rise of on state current di dt is used, the gate control current must generally be increased. A conventional thyristor cannot satisfy the contracictory requirements described above. If a photothyristor which is triggered by light instead of by the gate current is used, the light energy to be used is limited and a gate drive with a higher current is difficult. Therefore, the critical rate of rise of on state current di dt cannot be increased. It is strongly desired that a thyristor of high dielectric strength and large capacitance be developed which achieves an improved gate sensitivity without impairing the ability of the thyristor to operate accurately with respect to the critical rate of rise of on state current di dt. Referring to Fig. 1, a prior art thyristor comprises a p type emitter layer 10, an n type base layer 12 r a p type base layer 14 and an n type emitter layer 16 which is formed in an annular shape when viewed from the top outside the p type base layer 14. An anode electrode 18 is deposited on one surface of the p type emitter layer 10. A cathode electrode 20 is deposited on the upper surface of the n type emitter layer 16.A plurality of pilot thyristors comprise the p type base layer 14, the n type base layer 12, the p type emitter layer 10, and n type emitter layers 221, 222 and 223 concentrically disposed at equal intervals.A light receiving portion 24 is formed at the center of the pilot thyristors. If an optical trigger signal is radiated on the light receiving portion of the thyristor with the above arrangement, an photocurrent Iph flows in the p type base layer 14 transversely. This current flows into the cathode electrode 20 through a short circuiting portion 26 disposed in the n type emitter layer 16. A transverse potential difference established in the p type base layer 14 due to the photocurrent Iph forward biases the n type emitter layers 221, 222 and 223 of the pilot thyristors. When the voltage of the light receiving portion 24 almost reaches the built in potential of the junction formed between the p type base layer 14 and the n type emitter layer 221r electron emission from the n type emitter layer 221 to the p type base layer 14 is increased abruptly.As a result, the pilot thyristor near the light receiving portion 24 is rendered conductive first. This turn on conduction current flows into the second pilot thyristor through an electrode 281. The turn on current, as the higher gate drive current, causes the second pilot thyristor to turn on and conduct. Similarly, the turn on current of the pilot thyristor then flows to the third pilot thyristor through an electrode 282.As a result, the third pilot thyristor is rendered conductive. Further, the turn on current of the third pilot thyristor flows into the main thyristor through the electrode 283 to turn it on. The current concentration which occurred in the initial turn on period is dispersed by the plurality of pilot thyristors, preventing the occurrence of hot spots and improving the critical rate of rise of the on state current di dt. However, in the thyristor having the multi layered amplification gate structure, the following drawbacks are presented. First, if the transverse potential difference of the p type base layer 14 of the first pilot thyristor is increased, photosensitivity gate sensitivity is increased, but the gate tends to be erroneously turned on by voltage noise from the main thyristor. More particularly, if surge voltage noise is applied between the anode electrode 18 and the cathode electrode 20, a displacement current flows in the same route as the photocurrent Iph. As a result, the thyristor tend to be erroneously turned on.In other words, the critical rate of rise of off state voltage dv dt is the maximum rate of rise allowed which will not cause the thyristor to turn on, taking into account any voltage noise present and will hereinafter be referred to as the critical rate of rise of off state voltage dv dt. More particularly, a radius R of the n type emitter layer 221 of the first pilot thyristor is decreased to limit the displacement current which may be generated in the n type emitter layer 221. Thus, the photosensitivity of the thyristor is improved, without reducing the critical rate of rise of off state voltage dv dt. Secondly, if the number of pilot thyristors is increased, the later stage pilot thyristors and the main thyristor tend to be erroneously turned on due to voltage noise. This second drawback is more important than the first drawback. Since the displacement current flows over the entire junction area unlike the photocurrent Iph, the displacement current is increased toward the short circuiting portion 26 of the n type emitter layer 16 of the main thyristor. Thirdly, if the number of pilot thyristors is increased, the minimum anode voltage for turning on the pilot thyristors, that is, the finger voltage is generally increased. When thyristors having large finger voltages are operated in parallel to each other, the ON voltage of the first thyristor which first turns on determines the respective anode voltages applied to the following thyristors. As a result, the remaining thyristors which have higher finger voltages than those of the conducted thyristors are not turned on. The above drawbacks are also found in electrically triggered thyristors in addition to the photothyristors. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a thyristor having an improved gate sensitivity photosensitivity while still preventing the critical rate of rise of off state voltage dv dt from being reduced. It is another object of the present invention to provide a thyristor which allows free arrangement of pilot thyristors, while still allowing the thyristor to operate properly by preventing the critical rate of rise of off state voltage dv dt from being exceeded. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a thyristor having an alignment between the light receiving portion and the optical triggering system. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a thyristor having a decreased finger voltage. It is yet still another object of the present invention to provide a thyristor having improved turn on characteristics. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a thyristor having an improved critical rate of rise of on state current di dt. These and other objects may be attained by the thyristor of the present invention which comprises a four layered main thyristor consisting of a first emitter layer, a first base layer, a second base layer and a second emitter layer which have alternate conductivity types and are alternately formed a collecting electrode deposited on a surface part of the second base layer adjacent to the second emitter layer of the main thyristor to absorb unnecessary displacement current generated in the second base layer and a plurality of pilot thyristors disposed in the collecting electrode, the plurality of pilot thyristors having, in the second base layer, a plurality of third emitter layers which have the same conductivity type as the second emitter layer and which are formed separately from the second emitter layer so that the plurality of pilot thyristors commonly use the first emitter layer, the first base layer and the second base layer with the main thyristor, the plurality of pilot thyristors each having a gate electrode formed on the second base layer surrounded by the third emitter layer, the gate electrodes being connected to emitter electrodes on the third emitter layers of the pilot thyristors of previous stages, and the emitter electrode of the pilot thyristor of the final stage being commonly used with the collecting electrode, whereby the turn on current of the pilot thyristor of the final stage of the plurality of pilot thyristor is supplied as a gate current from the collecting electrode to said main thyristor. According to the present invention, since the collecting electrode is arranged to absorb the displacement current, the displacement current influences the thyristor of the present invention much less than in the conventional thyristor. Therefore, the gate sensitivity is greatly improved without impairing the ability of thyristor to operate below the critical rate of rise of orf state voltage dv dt. The displacement current is controlled, regardless of the number and arrangement of the stages of the pilot thyristors surrounded by the collecting electrode. Therefore, the thyristor according to the present invention can be readily designed to control the ability of the thyristor to operate below the critical rate of rise of off state voltage dv dt.If the present invention is applied to a photothyristor, the radius of the light receiving portion can be increased, and alignment between the light receiving portion and the optical triggering system is improved. Further, since the width of the second base layer of the pilot thyristor can differ from those of other layers, the maximum turn on current of the first pilot thyristor is greatly decreased, resulting in a decreased number of pilot thyristors and a reduction of the finger voltage. With the above arrangement, the turn on characteristics are also improved. Further, since the thyristor according to the present invention has a structure having the collecting electrode and the plurality of pilot thyristors, the critical rate of rise of on state current di dt is greatly improved. By way of example and to make the description clearer, reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a schematic sectional view of a conventional photothyristor Fig. 2 is a schematic plan view showing the electrode arrangement of a thyristor according to a first embodiment of the present invention Fig. 3 is a schematic sectional view of the thyristor shown in Fig. 2 Fig. 4 is a graph for explaining the maximum turn on current of a first pilot thyristor of the thyristor shown in Fig. 2 as a function of the number of stages thereof as compared with the maximum turn on current of the conventional thyristor as a function of the number of stages thereof Fig. 5 is a schematic plan view of a thyristor according to a second embodiment of the present invention and Fig. 6 is a schematic sectional view of the thyristor shown in Fig. 5. A thyristor according to a first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 2 is a schematic plan view showing an electrode arrangement of the thyristor according to the first embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 3 is a schematic sectional view of the thyristor taken along the line Al Al in Fig. 2. The same reference numerals as in Fig. 1 denote the same parts in Figs. 2 and 3. A collecting electrode 30 is deposited on a p type base layer 14 among the four semiconductor layers which constitute the thyristor. First and second pilot thyristors 32 and 34 are surrounded by the collecting electrode 30. An n type emitter layer 321, concentric with the light receiving portion 24, is formed in the first pilot thyristor 32. A cathode electrode 322 is deposited on the n type emitter layer 321. As shown inFig. 2, the second pilot thyristor 34 is formed so as to surround the first pilot thyristor 32 in a horse shoe shape. The second pilot thyristor 34 comprises double n type emitter layers 341 surrounded by the collecting electrode 30, an emitter electrode formed on the n type emitter layer 3g1 and a gate electrode 343 formed on the p type base layer 14.The emitter electrode 342 and the collecting electrode 30 are used commonly. The gate electrode 343 of the second pilot thyristor 34 is electrically connected to the cathode electrode 322 of the first pilot thyristor 32 through a conductor 36 such as an aluminum wire. Therefore, the turn on current of the first pilot thyristor 32 is supplied as the gate current of the second pilot thyristor 34. The depth of the n type emitter layer 341 of the second pilot thyristor 34 is deeper than that of the n type emitter layer 321 of the first pilot thyristor 32 so that the width of the p type layer 14 of the second pilot thyristor 34 is smaller than that of the p type base layer 14 of the first pilot thyristor 32. If an optical trigger signal is radiated on the light receiving portion 24 of the thyristor with the above arrangement, the photocurrent Iph is generated in a central depletion layer. The photocurrent Iph then flows into the p type base layer 14. The flow in current is collected in the collecting electrode 30 formed on the p type base layer 14 as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 3. Thereafter, the photocurrent Iph flows into the cathode electrode 20 through the p type base layer 14 and the short circuiting portion 26. At this time, since the photocurrent Iph flows transversely in the p type base layer 14 immediately below the first pilot thyristor 32, the n type emitter layer 321 of the first pilot thyristor 32 is forward biased by the transverse potential difference in the p type base layer.When the deepest potential in the forward bias almost reaches the built in potential of the junction between the n type emitter layer 321 and the p type base layer 14, electron injection from the n type emitter layer 321 to the p type base layer 14 increases to turn on the first pilot thyristor 32. A turn on current Ipl of the first pilot thyristor 32 is supplied as the higher gate drive current to the gate electrode 343 of the second pilot thyristor 34 through the conductor 36 to turn on the second pilot thyristor 34. A turn on current ip2 of the second pilot thyristor 34 flows through the collecting electrode 30 and the short circuiting portion 26 and is supplied to the cathode electrode 20. This turn on current ip2 serves as the gate current of the main thyristor to turn on the main thyristor. With the above arrangement, the width of the p type base layer 14 of the second pilot thyristor 34 is narrower than that of the p type base layer 14 of the first pilot thyristor 32. The p type base width directly influences the turn on duration of the thyristor. If the width of the p type base layer is narrower, the turn on duration is generally short.When the second pilot thyristor 34 is turned on by the turn on current ipi of the first pilot thyristor 32, the turn on current of the second pilot thyristor is abruptly increased. As a result, only a small amount of current is required to be output from the first pilot thyristor 32. Since the width of the base layer of the second pilot thyristor 34 is small, sharp turn on operation is performed. Therefore, the turn on characteristics of the group of pilot thyristors are improved greatly as compared with the conventional thyristor arrangement in which all the base layers have the same width. F g. 4 is a graph for explaining the number N of stages of pilot thyristors as a function of maximum turn on current Iplm of the first pilot thyristor, where N 0 indicates a conventional thyristor without having pilot thyristors. Line a indicates the electrical characteristics of the conventional thyristor shown inFig. 1, while line b indicates the electrical characteristics of the thyristor according to the present invention. As is apparent from the graph, along with an increase in the number N of stages of thyristors, the maximum turn on current of the first stage is linearly decreased, so far as the conventional structure in which all widths of the p type base layers of the pilot thyristors are the same is concerned. However, according to the arrangement of the thyristor of the present invention, the maximum turn on current Iplm can be reduced into half or less with the two stage structure. Assume that the maximum turn on current Iplm is to be as 80 A. Then, a four stage arrangement must be utilized in the conventional thyristor arrangement. According to the present invention, the first pilot thyristor 32 produces only a small current without requiring an increase in the number of stages of pilot thyristors. Since the radius R of the first pilot thyristor 32 is decreased and the displacement current is effectively controlled, the ability of the thyristor to operate below the critical rate of rise of off state voltage dv dt is not impaired and the gate sensitivity photosensitivity is greatly improved.Further, according to the present invention, since the number N of stages of the pilot thyristors can be decreased, the finger voltage can also be decreased. The second pilot thyristor 34 does not completely encompass the first pilot thyristor 32, so that the displacement current developed in the first pilot thyristor 32 need not be considered in designing the second pilot thyristor 34. Therefore, the pilot thyristors can be arranged freely and the operating characteristics of the thyristor with respect to the critical rate of rise of off state voltage dv dt can be readily controlled. Since the width and length of the n type emitter layer 341 of the second pilot thyristor 34 are determined to be sufficiently large, the initial turn on region can be sufficiently large. Although a relatively large current is required to be generated from the second pilot thyristor 34, the turn on characteristics of the device with regard to the critical rate of rise of on state current di dt are not lowered. Fig. 5 is a schematic plan view showing the electrode arrangement of a thyristor according to a second embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 6 is a schematic sectional view of the thyristor taken along the line All All in Fig. 5. The same reference numerals as in Fig. 1 denote the same parts in Figs. 5 and 6. A collecting electrode 50 is deposited on the upper surface part of the p type base layer 14 adjacent to the n type emitter layer 16 of the main thyristor comprising the p type emitter layer 10, the n type base layer 12, the p type base layer 14 and the n type emitter layer 16. A plurality of pilot thyristors 5 in the second embodiments are surrounded by the collecting electrode 50. A main thyristor 51 is formed at the outer periphery of the collecting electrode 50, that is, the peripheries of the pilot thyristors. More particularly, the first pilot thyristor 32 has the n type emitter layer 321 which has an annular shape when viewed from the top and which surrounds the light receiving portion 24. The cathode electrode 322 is deposited on the upper surface of the n type emitter layer 321.Second to fifth pilot thyristors 52, 54, 56 and 58 comprise n type emitter layers 521, 541 561, and 581 surrounded by the collecting electrode 50 formed in the p type base layer 14, emitter electrodes 522, 542 562 and 582 respectively deposited on the n type emitter layers 521, 5A1 561 and 581, and gate electrodes 523, 543f 563 and 583 deposited on the p type base electrodes, respectively. The emitter electrode 582 of the fifth pilot thyristor 58 is used commonly with the collecting electrode 50.The gate electrodes 523, 543, 563 and 583 are subsequently electrically connected to the emitter electrodes 522, 542 562 and 582 through a metal layer 60 such as an aluminum wire, respectively. Therefore, the pilot thyristors 52, 54, 56 and 58 receive the turn on currents as the gate currents which are output from the thyristors of the immediately preceding stages, respectively. These thyristors 52 through 58 are then sequentially turned on. The main thyristor 51 receives the turn on current of the fifth pilot thyristor 58 through the collecting electrode 50 and is rendered conductive. The connections of the pilot thyristors 52 through 58 are not particularly limited. When the optical gate signal is radiated on the light receiving portion 24 of the thyristor of the above arrangement, the photocurrent Iph generated in a central junction depletion region of the first pilot thyristor 32 flows into the p type base layer 14. This photocurrent Iph flows transversely in the p type base layer 14 and collected in the collecting electrode 50 disposed in the p type base layer. Thereafter, the photocurrent Iph flows into the cathode electrode 20 through the p type base layer 14 and the shortcircuiting portion 26. As a result, a transverse potential difference in the p type base layer 14 of the first pilot thyristor 32 is established due to the photocurrent Iph. The n type emitter layer 321 of the first pilot thyristor 32 is forward biased.When the deepest potential of the forward bias voltage almost reaches the junction built in potential between the n type emitter layer 321 and the p type base layer 14, electron injection from the n type emitter layer 321 to the p type base layer 14 is increased abruptly.Therefore, the first pilot thyristor 32 is turned on beginning with the junction between the n type emitter layer 321 and the p type base layer 14. The turn on current of the first pilot thyristor 32 is supplied as the gate current to the gate electrode 523 of the second pilot thyristor 52 through the metal layer 60. The second pilot thyristor 52 is then turned on. Similarly, the turn on current of the second pilot thyristor 52 is supplied to the third pilot thyristor 54 which is, in turn, turned on. The fourth and fifth pilot thyristors 56 and 58 are sequentially turned on in the same manner as the third thyristor. Further, the turn on current of the fifth pilot thyristor 58 flows into the cathode electrode 20 through the collecting electrode 50 and the short circuiting portion 26. This turn on current serves as the gate current of the main thyristor 51, so that the main thyristor 51 is turned on. With the above mode of operation, if voltage noise having a large critical rate of rise of off state voltage dv dt is applied between the anode and the cathode, the displacement current generated in the p type base layer 14 is collected to the collecting electrode 50 which surrounds the pilot thyristors 32, 52, 54, 56 and 58 and flows into the cathode electrode 20 through the p type base layer 14 and the shortcircuiting portion 26. Therefore, according to the thyristor of the second embodiment of the present invention, influence of the displacement current which has been a drawback in the conventional thyristor can be eliminated. Further, the displacement current can be controlled regardless of the arrangement of the pilot thyristors.Even if the number of stages of the pilot thyristors is increased, the thyristor s ability to operate below the critical rate of rise of off state voltage dv dt of the final stage of pilot thyristors and the main thyristor is not lowered. The maximum turn on current Iplm of the first pilot thyristor 32 is linearly decreased with an increase in the number N of stages, as indicated by line a in Fig. 4. The power concentration on the first pilot thyristor 32 is prevented by increasing the number N of stages. The radius R is decreased and the displacement current generated in this region is controlled, so that a large resistance can be set in the p type base layer 14 immediately below the n type emitter layer of the first pilot thyristor 32. As a result, the gate sensitivity photosensitivity can be improved without impairing the thyristor s operating characteristics with respect to the critical rate of rise of off state voltage dv dt. For example, the gate sensitivity can be as high as 2 to 3 mW.Further, the ability of the thyristor to operate below the critical rate of rise of on state current di dt is improved two to three times that of the conventional thyristor. According to the present invention, the gate sensitivity photosensitivity is improved greatly without impairing essential characteristics of the thyristor such as the thyristor s ability to operate below the critical rate of rise of off state voltage dv dt and the critical rate of rise of on state current The present invention is not limited to the particular embodiments. For example, in the first and second embodiments, the present invention is applied to the photothyristor. However, the present invention may be applied to an electrically triggered thyristor which has a gate electrode in the light receiving portion 24. Further, pilot thyristors need only be arranged to be surrounded by the collecting electrode formed in the base layer so as to sequentially electrically connect the pilot thyristors. Therefore, the number of stages as shown in the first and second embodiments may be arbitrarily changed as needed in accordance with design specifications. Various changes and modifications may be made within the spirit and scope of the present invention.
