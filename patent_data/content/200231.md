# METHODS FOR PREPARING RABBIT MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, THE CELL LINES USED THEREIN AND THE ANTIBODIES PRODUCED THEREBY

## Abstract
A new continuous rabbit cell line, designated TP 3, and variants thereof, which are hypoxyxanthineguanine phosphoribosyl transferase deficient, hypoxyxanthine aminopterine thymidine sensitive, fast growing and non antibody producing, and the methods for preparing the TP 3 cell line. Also, rabbit rabbit hybrid cells formed by fusing the TP 3 cell line with antibody producing cells from immunized rabbits, which hybrid cells are hypoxyxanthine aminopterine thymidine insensitive and secrete rabbit anti bodies, and the methods for preparing the hybrid cells and hybrid cell lines. The invention further comprises rabbit monoclonal antibody.
