# Novel cytotoxic aminoalkyl phenol ethers.

## Abstract
This invention is concerned with N,N dialkyl 2 4 phenyl methyl phenoxy ethanamine and N morpholino 2 4 phenyl methyl phenoxy ethanamine and their salts, and the produc tion of these compounds. These compounds bind singificantly to the anti estrogen binding sites but only poorly to the estro gen receptor sites, and are cytotoxic to breast cancer cells in vitro.
