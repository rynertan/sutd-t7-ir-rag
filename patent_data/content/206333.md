# Mass transducer with electromagnetic compensation.

## Abstract
A new mass transducer 10 with electromagnetic com pensation is described, comprising a load detection part, fitted with a coil 12 fixed to the load levers, a reference part comprising a sample weight 23 and a second coil 15 called reference coil fixed to the reference levers, a mag netic unit yoke with permanent magnets 16, 17 and 13, 14 in the air gap whereof the coils 12 and 15 are placed co axially, free to move independently of one another, a con trol device for keeping the load coil and the reference coil in place and a device for comparing the current flowing through said coils. According to the in invention, the coils 12 and 15 are of the flattened toric type, their biggest di mension being perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the lever arm 18 of the load levers and the winding axis X X of the coil lined up with the force axis. The magnetic circuit has the form of a wafer formed by two flat magnetic elements 26, 27 facing each other, made integral with a central plate 28 through one or more fastening members, inside which at least one pair of permanent magnets 16, 17 or 13, 14 , fit ted so as to form two air gaps symmetrical to the central me tal body wherein the coils are housed. The magnets are po sitioned so that each coil is immersed in an equiversal mag netic field, directed perpendicular to its biggest surface.
