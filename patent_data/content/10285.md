## Description
HYDROXYL TERMIE7ATED LIQUID POLYMERS AND PROCESS FOR PREPARATION THEREOF BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Hydroxyl terminated liquid polymers containing ester groups are known in the art. For example,U.S. Patents 3,551,472 and 3,699,153 disclose such polymers made by reacting carboxyl terminated liquid polymers with a diol in the presence of an acid catalyst, and U.S. Patent 3,712,916 discloses such polymers made by reacting a carboxyl terminated liquid polymer with ethylene oxide in the presence of a tertiary amine catalyst. Ester groups present near the terminal portions of such polymers are rather prone to hydrolytic degradation and may reduce the useful life of products in which the polymers are used.New hydroxyl terminated liquid polymers are desired having improved hydrolytic stability. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Hydroxyl terminated liquid polymers are prepared by reacting at least one aminoalcohol with a carboxyl terminated liquid polymer having a carboncarbon backbone. The hydroxyl terminated liquid polymers have the formulaEMI1.1 wherein B is the carbon carbon backbone, and HO X is a univalent radical obtained by removing a hydrogen atom from an amine group of an aliphatic, alicyclic, heterocyclic or aromatic aminoalcohol containing one primary or secondary hydroxyl group and one primary or secondary amine group per molecule. DETAILED DESCRIPTION New hydroxyl terminated liquid polymers having improved hydrolytic stability are produced by reacting at least one aminoalcohol with a carboxylterminated liquid polymer having a carbon carbon backbone. The hydroxyl terminated liquid polymers have the formulaEMI2.1 wherein HUr X is aunivalent radical obtained by removing a hydrogen atom from an amine group of an aliphatic, alicyclic, heterocyclic or aromatic aminoalcohol containing one primary or secondary hydroxyl group and one primary or secondary amine group per a wnoalcohol molecule, with primary hydroxyl and amine groups being preferred. B is a polymeric backbone comprising carbon carbon linkages.Generally, the carbon carbon linkages comprise at least about 95 wt. of total polymeric backbone weight, preferably about 100 wt. of total polymeric backbone weight. The hydroxylterminated liquid polymers contain an average of at least about 1.5 hydroxyl groups per molecule, more preferably from about 1.5 to 20 hydroxyl groups per molecule, and even more preferably from about 1.7 to about 4 hydroxyl groups per molecule. The fact that the average number may be slightly Lss than 2 is accounted for by the fact that not all hydroxyl terminated molecules in a given sample need have hydroxyl groups at both ends of the molecule. Average numbers of hydroxyl groups per molecule above 2 are explained by the fact that additional group s may be located pendant to the polymer backbone.For example, an aminoalcohol will react with acrylic acid backbone unit s in the starting carboxyl terminated liquid polymer as well as with end carboxyl group s , resulting in both pendant and terminal hydroxyl functionality. The hydroxyl terminated liquid polymers of this invention typically have Brookfield viscosities measured using a Brookfield RVT viscometer at 27eC , from about 200 cps to about 2,000,000 cps, more preferably from about 200 cps to about 1,200,000 cps.The hydroxyl terminated liquid polymers also typically have hydroxyl equivalent weights gram molecular weight per hydroxyl group from about 300 to about 4,000, more preferably from about 300 to about 2,500. The carboxyl terminated liquid polymers used as starting materials may have Brookfield viscosities from about 500 cps to about 2,500,000 cps, more preferably from about 500 cps to about 1,200,000 cps, and of course have a backbone comprising carboncarbon linkages. The backbone may contain polymerized units of at least one vinylidene monomer having at least one terminal CH2 C group and being selected from the group consisting of a monoolefins containing 2 to 14 carbon atoms, more preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms, such as ethylene, propylene, isobutylene, 1butene, l pentene, l hexene, l dodecene and the like b dienes containing 4 to 10 carbon atoms, more preferably 4 to 8 carbon atoms, such as butadiene, isoprene, 2 isopropyl 1,3 butadiene, and the like and c vinyl and allyl ethers of alkyl radicals containing 1 to 8 carbon atoms such as vinyl methyl ether, allyl methyl ether, and the like. The monoolefins and dienes are preferred. The vinylidene monomers described above may be polymerized readily with from 0 to about 50 by weight, more preferably from 0 to about 35 by weight, of at least one vinylidene comonomer selected from the group consisting of d vinyl aromatics having the formula EMI4.1 wherein R is hydrogen or an alkyl radical containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as styrene, a methyl styrene, vinyl toluene, and the like e vinyl nitriles having the formulaEMI4.2 wherein R1 is hydrogen or an alkyl radical containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms1 such as acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile and the like f divinyls and diacrylates such as divinyl benzene, divinyl ether, diethylene glycol diacrylate, and the like g amides of a,ss olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acids containing 2 to 8 carbon atoms such as acrylamide and the like h hydroxyl containing vinylidene monomers for the purpose of including some random hydroxyl functionality, such as allyl alcohol and vinyl benzyl alcohol i certain acrylic acids and acrylates and j other vinylidene comonomers such as diacetone acrylamide, N vinyl 2 pyrrolidone and the like. The acrylic acids and acrylates have the formulaEMI4.3 wherein R2 is hydrogen or an alkyl radical containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms and R3 is hydrogen or an alkyl radical containing 1 to 18 carbon atoms, more prefer ably 1 to 8 carbon atoms or an alkoxyalky yw Ohs 0 alkyl, or cyanoalkyl radical containing 2 to 12 carbon atoms, more preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms.Even more preferably R3 is hydrogen or an alkyl radical containing 1 to 8 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable acrylates include ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, dodecyl acrylate, octadecyl acrylate, methoxyethyl acrylate, butoxyethyl acrylate, hexylthioethyl acrylate, 6 cyanoethyl acrylate, cyanooctyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, octyl methacrylate and the like. Often two or more types of these polymerized monomeric units are contained in the polymeric backbone, with vinyl nitriles, vinyl aromatics, and N vinyl 2 pyrrolidone being preferred. When the acrylic acids and acrylates just described are used, transamidation reactions may occur to produce pendant hydroxyl functionality as shown in the following equation employing 2 amino l ethanol EMI5.1 A further reaction by the pendant hydroxyls may occur, i.e., transesterification with another acrylate linkage, resulting in crosslinking and an increase in product viscosity EMI6.1 Liquid carboxyl terminated polymers may be prepared by free radical polymerization using carboxyl containing initiators and or modifiers as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,285,949 and German Patent 1,150,205 and by solution polymerization using lithium metal or organometallic compounds and posttreating the polymers to form carboxyl groups as disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,135,716 and 3,431,235.The polymers can also be prepared by reacting liquid polymers having other than terminal carboxyl groups with compounds so as to yield carboxyl groups. For example, liquid halogen terminated polymers can be reacted with unsaturated anhydrides in the presence of Lewis acids to yield carboxyl terminated liquid polymers. Thus, it is seen that the method of preparing the liquid carboxyl terminated polymers is not critical to the invention. The essential features of the polymers are that at least terminal carboxyl groups be present together with a carbon carbon polymeric backbone. Examples of preferred carboxyl terminated liquid polymers include carboxyl terminated polyethylene, carboxyl terminated polyisobutylene, carboxylterminated polybutadiene, carboxyl terminated polyisoprene, as well as carboxyl terminated poly blrta diene acrylonitrile , carboxyl terminated poly butadiene styrene , and carboxyl terminated poly butadiene n butyl acrylate . Carboxyl terminated copolymers of butadiene with acrylonitrile or styrene were found to be especially useful. These polymers may contain from about 50 to about 99 by weight of butadiene, from about 0 to about 40 by weight of acrylonitrile or styrene and from about 1 to about 15 by weight of carboxyl, based upon the total weight of polymer. Aminoalcohols suitable for use in the process of this invention typically contain from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, one primary or secondary hydroxyl group, and one primary or secondary amine group per molecule, with primary hydroxyl and amine groups being preferred.Of course, tertiary amine groups may also be present but are not reactive in the process, although they may hydrolyze the acrylates described heretofore as comonomers. Suitable aminoalcohols include 2 amino lethanol, 2 amino l butanol, l amino l cyclopentanemethanol, 6 amino l hexanol, 2 amino 3 methyl lbutanol, 2 amino 2 methyl l propanol, 5 amino l pentanol, 2 amino l phenylethyl alcohol, l amino 2propanol, 3 amino l propanol, 2 benzylaminoethanol, N a hydroxyethylpiperazine, 2 anilinoethanol, 2benzimidazolemethanol, 2 piperidinemethanol, 3 piperidinemethanol, 2 piperidineethanol,and o , m and paminobenzyl alcohol. Excellent results were obtained using 2 amino 1 ethanol. A solvent is not required for the process of this invention but may be used. Mixtures of solvents may also be used. Suitable solvents include aliphatic and cycloaliphatic ethers containing from 3 to 10 carbon atoms, more preferably from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, such as tetrahydrofuran, diethylether and the like. Also suitable as solvents and more preferred are aromatic compounds having the formulaEMI8.1 wherein R4 is hydrogen or an alkyl radical containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms, and at least two R4 s are hydrogen.More preferably R4 is hydrogen or an alkyl radical containing 1 or 2 carbon atoms, and at least three R4s are hydrogen. Suitable aromatic solvents include benzene, toluene, o ,m and p xylene, o , m and pdiethylbenzene, cumene, mesitylene and the like. A sufficient quantity of at least one aminoalcohol may be reacted with a carboxyl terminated liquid polymer in order to produce a hydroxyl terminated liquid polymer containing at least about 1.5 hydroxyl groups per molecule. Typically the average number of total carboxyl groups in a liquid polymer before reaction will be from about 1.5 to about 20 groups per molecule, more preferably from about 1.7 to about 4 groups per molecule.In this typical case, from about 1.2 to about 6 amine equivalents, more preferably from about 1.2 to about 3 amine equivalents1 of at least one am ncancohnl can be used pew e uiva lent of carboxyl terminated polymer T.S r aminoalcohol amounts than 6 amine equivalents per equivalent of carboxyl terminated liquid polymer may make purification i.e., removal of unreacted aminoalcohol of the hydroxyl terminated liquid polymer more difficult. No catalyst is required, and many types of mixing apparatus can be used in the hydroxyl termination reaction. For example, simple mixers can be used, including turbine stirrers as well as propeller mixers.Reaction components can be combined in any order. The reaction mixture may be heated or refluxed if a solvent is used at a temperature from about 800C. to about 2000C., until more than 90 of carboxyl groups have reacted with the aminoalcohol, i.e., until the amidation reaction is more than 90 complete.Reaction time is typically about 1 to 120 hours.By products may be removed by evaporation or the like as they are formed eçg., water from the carboxylamine reaction . Low molecular weight diesters may e added at, near the end of, or after reaction in order to é IminatSiresiduau aminoalcohol by a transamidation reaction. Such diesters typically have molecular weights less than about 300, for example diethyl maleate, diethyl malonate, diethyl methylsuccinate, and the like. The diesters may also function as reactive plasticizers in subsequent curing reactions if not removed during purification. The hydroxyl terminated liquid polymers may be purified by vacuum distillation or by washing with a solvent such as a benzene methanol mixture in order to remove the unreacted aminoalcohol, followed by drying the polymer. The structure of amide formed during preparation of the hydroxyl terminated liquid polymers can be determined by infrared spectroscopy. Amine value can be analyzed quantitatively following the procedure described by Siggia, QuantitativeOrganic Analysis via Functional Groups, N.Y., Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1963, pp. 452 456, using a toluene isopropanol solvent mixture instead of Siggia s ethylene glycol isopropancl mixture. The following examples illustrate the present invention more fully. EXAMPLE 1 Carboxyl terminated Liquid Polymer A carboxyl terminated poly butadiene acryl lonitrile was prepared according to the general method of U.S. Patent 3,285,959. The carboxylterminated liquid polymer was found to have a Brookfield viscosity of about 55,000 cps. measured using aBrookfield RVT viscometer at 270C. and to contain about 82.7 wt. butadiene and about 10 wt. acryloni trill It is sold under the trademark Hycar3 CTBN 1300X15 by The BFGoodrich Company, Chemical Division. The amount of 2 amino l ethanol required to react with a given amount of the carboxyl terminated liquid polymer was calculated using the formula AA Ratio Ephr COOH X Mol.

Wt. molecular weight of the AA aminoalcohol, i.e., 61 for 2 amino l ethanol AA Ratio desired ratio of amine equi CTP valents of aminoalcohol to equivalents of carboxyl terminated liquid polymer CTP and weight in grams of car CTP boxyl terminated liquid polymer CTP . Hydroxyl terminated Liquid Polymer The carboxyl terminated liquid polymer produced by the method of U.S. Patent 3,285,949 was found to have an Ephr of 0.053 and was reacted with 2 COOH amino l ethanol in a 1.2 AA CTP Ratio, i.e., 1006 grams of carboxyl terminated liquid polymer was reacted with 39.0 grams of 2 amino l ethanol. The following reaction procedure was used.A 2 liter, 4 necked glass flask was cleaned thoroughly with soap and water, rinsed first with water and then with acetone, and flushed with nitrogen until dry.The flask was equipped with an air stirrer, thermometer, nitrogen inlet tube, and Dean Stark water trap with water condenser. The carboxyl terminated liquid polymer and 2 amino 1 ethanol were charged to the flask with stirring together with 200 ml. toluene, and the reaction mixture was heated to about 1500 C. using an oil bath. The flask was purged continuously with nitrogen during reaction. After final EphrcOOH of the reaction mixture was reduced to less than 10 of the initial EphrC00H the gas inlet tube was replaced by a stopper, and the water condenser was connected to a vacuum pump. A vacuum about 1 to 2 mm Hg was drawn on the flask and maintained for about 2 hours in order to remove some excess 2 amino 1 ethanol and other volatiles.A hydroxyl terminated liquid polymer was produced which is believed to have the following formula EMI11.1 wherein B is a polymeric butadiene acrylonitrile backbone, and HO CH2 2 N is a species of the univalent radical HO X defined heretofore, i.e., it is obtained by removing a hydrogen atom from the primary amine group of 2 amino l ethanol. The hydroxyl terminated liquid polymer was found to have a Brookfield viscosity of 360,000 cps. at 27 C. using a Brookfield RVT viscometer and 4 spindle,. It was also found to have an EphrOH of 0.042, EphrOH being defined as the hydroxyl equivalents per hundred weight parts of hydroxyl terminated liquid polymer. Cure of Hydrox l terminated Liquid Polymer Several 10 gram portions of the hydroxylterminated liquid polymer described above were mixed using a spatula with toluene diisocyanate in amounts varying from 0.9 gram to 0.6 gram. Each sample was placed individually in a small aluminum pan and cured for 2 hours at 1000C. in a circulating air oven. The products were found to be rubbery. EXAMPLE 2 The above hydroxyl termination reaction was also performed at 125 C. in the absence of toluene using a carboxyl terminated liquid polymer having a BrooKield viscosity of about 112,000 cps. measured using a Brookfield RVT viscometer at 270C , containing about 76.5 wt. butadiene and about 16.4 wt. acrylonitrile, and having an EhrC00H of about 0.052. It is sold under the trademark Hycar commat CTBII 1300X8 by The BFoodrich Company, Chemical Division.This polymer was reacted with 2 amino l ethanol in a 1.5 AA CTPRatio according to the following recipe Material Wt. a EquivalentsCarboxyl terminated 1000 0.52 liquid polymer 2 amino l ethanol 47.6 0.779Diethyl Maleate 23.5 0.273The diethyl maleate was added after approximately 8 hours of reaction in order to eliminate residual 2amino l ethanol. Total reaction time was about 12 hours. Again, a hydroxyl terminated liquid polymer was produced which is believed to have the following formula EMI13.1 wherein B is a polymeric butadiene acrylonitrile backbone, and HO CH2 2 N is a species of the univalent radical HO X defined heretofore, i.e., it is obtained by removing a hydrogen atom from the primary amine group of 2 amino l ethanol. The hydroxyl terminated liquid polymers produced by the process of this invention contain amide groups adjacent to the polymer backbone and have improved hydrolytic stability compared to similar polymers e.g., those of U.S. Patents 3,551,472, 3,699,153 and 3,712,916 wherein ester groups are present. The novel polymers are useful together with polyisocyanates for open or centrifugal casting, liquid injection molding and the like to make thermoset elastomeric objects such as flexible automotive parts, e.g., side shields and front ends , and can also be used as binders for belts, hoses or the like.
