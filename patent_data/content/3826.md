# Valve assembly.

## Abstract
A valve assembly 10 of the type providing bypass flow through a branch channel 20 when the movable valve member 40 is in the closed position to block flow through the main flow channel outlet 16 . A venturi device 44 is disposed in the main channel 14 upstream of the movable valve member 40 , and the venturi 44 has secondary ports 58 provided through the wall at the throat section. When the movable valve member 40 is in the closed position, flow into the venturi 44 exits at the flow ports and flows through the bypass channel 20 . When the movable valve member 40 is in the open position, flow discharges from the venturi 44 , through the main channel 14 outlet port downstream of the movable valve member 40 , thereby causing reduced pressure at the venturi throat and preventing flow through the secondary ports 58 to the bypass channel.
