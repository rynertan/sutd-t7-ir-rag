## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION Lysosomotropic Detergent Therapeutic AgentsSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to compositions useful in the control of fertility, in the inhibition of malignant cell growth, and in the control of other diseases which accumulate macrophages at the disease site. More specifically, it relates to novel chemical compositions and pharmaceutical formulations comprising a weakly basic amine having a pK of from 4.5 to 9 incorporating a hydrophobic moiety or a peptide conjugate which is hydrolyzed by lysosomal enzymes to an active substance.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Lysosomotropic substances have been designated as substances which are selectively taken up by lysosomes regardless of their chemical nature or mechanism of uptake.It has been suggested that the property of lysosomotropism is useful in the preparation of therapeutic agents having useful biological properties. These substances can enter the lysosomes preferentially and exert their biological influence because of their own unique biological activity.They also can be coupled with active drugs and, following preferential uptake by lysosomes, can be hydrolyzed within the lysosome with release of the active drug at the target area. Thus, in one method of using the lysosomotropic agent DNA, a complex of DNA with the potent cytotoxic agent daunorubicin was formed. It was then found that the complex was preferentially taken up by the tumor cells and that the DNA was preferentially degraded by lysosomes leaving the active daunorubicin within the lysosome. A drawback of this particular method is that the toxic dose is very close to the therapeutic dose which makes the margin of safety very narrow.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is concerned with the inhibition of lysosome bearing cells. More particularly, the present invention is concerned with new compositions and new pharmaceutical formulations which are useful in inhibiting the function of lysosome bearing cells. Still more specifically, the present invention comprises novel pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutical carrier and a lysosomotropic substance comprising a a weakly basic amine having a pK of from 5 8 and at least one hydrophobic substituent which is preferably an alkyl or unsaturated alkyl substituent having at ieat B tabo atoms or on a substituted alkyl substituent having at least 4 carbon atoms, or b a peptide amide coupled through the amide function with a biologically active material which is readily hydrolyzed by lysosomal enzymes either within the lysosome or at the outside surface of the lysosome bearing cell. More specifically, the present invention comprises novel pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutical carrier and a an amine compound having a pK of from 5 8 of the formula EMI2.1 in which R is an alkyl or unsaturated alkyl substituent of from 8 30 carbons or a substituted alkyl substituent of from 4 30 carbons, R1 is hydrogen or alkyl, and R2 is an electron withdrawing group to control the pK of the amine between 4.5 and 9 including fluoroalkyl such as trifluoroethyl or di fluoroethyl, carboxymethyl, cyanoethyl, hydroxy, methoxy, amino, alkylamino, and acylamidino or b an alkyl substituted, nitrogen containing hetero cyclic compound having a pK of 4.9 to 9 of the formula EMI3.1 whereinZ is either 0 or 1 R is alkyl or unsaturated alkyl, each of which con tains from 8 30 carbons, substituted alkyl of from 4 30 carbons, or a steroidal radical comprising 3 cholesteryl R4 is acyl including COOR1, CORÃš, in which R is alkyl or aryl, arylsulfonyl includingEMI4.1 or phosphoryl PO3 and R5 is selected from H or loweralkyl or c a compound of the formula M N A wherein N is an amine nitrogen, M is a masking group comprising a peptide substituent that can be hydro lyzed by any lysosomal enzyme comprising z Gly Phe, Gly Phe, z Arg Arg, or Benzoyl Arg, and A or N A is an active therapeutic drug coupled with the peptide by way of an amide linkage.This A or N A substi tuent is either an antifertility agent, a tumor inhibiting substance, an antibiotic substance, or an antiinflammatory steroid. More specifically, the present invention comprises novel lysosomotropic amine compositions of the formula EMI4.2 wherein R is an alkyl substituent of from 8 to 18 carbons,R1 is hydrogen, alkyl, or substituted alkyl, and R2 is fluoroalkyl selected from difluoroethyl and trifluoroethyl. The compositions of the present invention are useful in selectively killing or altering the function of lysosome bearing cells, and they are also useful as systems for the delivery of an active drug to the disease site where the active drug is released by lysosomal en zymitic hydrolysis. Thus, the compositions of this invention are useful as antifertility agents. As antifertility agents, the active principle for example, a compound of the formula EMI5.1 in which R, R1, and R2 are as defined previously is in corporate into vaginal creams, jellies, or foams in a concentration of from 0.1t to 10 , preferably 1 10 .The formulation prepared in this manner is administered intravaginally and contact of the sperm with the composition of the present invention incorporates the active principle into the acrosome of the sperm cells, thus revering them infertile. The compositions of the present invention are also useful in inhibiting the growth of malignant tumor cells. For this purpose, the compositions of the present invention are administered either orally or by injection in a dosage schedule of 25 500 mg kg day. The compositions of the present invention are also useful in combatting infection caused by resistant microorganisms, which are sequestered within lysosomes and thus unavailable to attack by antibiotics. The lysosomotropic compositions of the present invention comprise an antibiotic incorporating a weakly basic amine group and a peptide linked to a carboxylic function of the antibiotic through an amide function. Such compositions are incorporated into the cell lysosome where they are hydrolyzed by lysosomal enzymes, thus releasing the active antibiotic principle to attack the infecting microorganism. Certain of the compositions of the present invention are useful in the treatment of inflammation. Thus a composition of an antiinflammatory steroid coupled to a lysosomally cleavable peptide through an amine function of the steroid is attracted to the site of inflammation, where it is cleaved by lysosomal enzymes at the site of inflammation thereby producing the desired antiinflammatory effect with reduced side effects. Alternatively, steroids such as cholesterol are rendered antiinflammatory by incorporating within them a lysosomotropic amine such as morpholine or trifluoroethylamine. The compounds of this invention can be administered either topically or systemically i.e., intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, orally, rectally, by aerosolization, or in the form of sterile implants for long action. The pharmaceutical compositions can be sterile, injectable suspensions or solutions, or solid, orally administrable, pharmaceutically acceptable tablets or capsules the compositions can also be intended for sublingual administration, or for suppository use. It is especially advantageous to formulate compositions in dosage unit forms for ease and economy of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as a term used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for animal and human subjects, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired biological effect in association with required pharmaceutical means. The low cost and ready accessibility of the compositions of this invention make them particularly promising for applications in veterinary medicine in which field their utilities are comparable to those in human medicine. A preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a new class of compounds of the formula EMI7.1 wherein R1 or R2 are hydrogen or alkyl, provided at least one of R1 and R2 is alkyl, alkenyl, or substituted alkyl containing from 8 18 carbons and R3 is a fluoroalkyl, preferably difluoro or trifluoroalkyl continuing from 2 3 carbons. These new compounds can be formulated into topical formulations for intravaginal administration as antifertility agents or may be formulated for oral or parenteral administration in accordance with the dose ranges given hereinabove. Compounds of this class are readily prepa red by reaction of an amine of the formula EMI7.2 with an anhydride or an ester of a fluorinated lower aliphatic carboxylic acid to produce an amide compound of the formula EMI7.3 wherein n is an integer of from 1 8 inclusive, x is 0 or 1, and y is 2 or 3 provided that the sum of x and y is 3. The resulting amide compound is then reduced to the desired amine product by treatment with a reducing agent such as borane tn a suitable aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a temperature of from OOC. to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture for a period of from 1 24 hours. Examples of such amines are N fluoroalkylamines such as l,l dihydroperfluorooctylamine N dodecyl 2,2,2 trifluoroethylamine N octyl 2,2,2 trifluoroethylamine N decyl 2,2,2 trifluoroethylamine N hexadecyl 2,2,2 trifluoroethylamine N octadecyl 2,2,2 trifluoroethylamine N dodecyl 2,2 difluoroethylamine. Another embodiment of the present invention comprises a pharmaceutical formulation comprising an inert carrier and an alkyl substituted, nitrogencontaining heterocyclic compound of the formula EMI8.1 wherein R is alkyl, alkenyl, or substituted alkyl of from 8 to 18 carbons. Pharmaceutical formulations of this type are prepared by incorporating an effective amount of the nitrogen containing heterocycle into a topical formulation such as a contraceptive jelly or foam. Examples of such heterocycles are N alkyl pyridines such as N nonyl, N tridecyl, N heptadecyl, and Nnonadecyl pyridine 2 alkyl pyridines such as 2 nonyl, 2 tridecyl, 2 heptadecyl, and 2 nonadecyl pyridines N alkyl morpholines such as N decyl, N dodecyl, N tetradecyl, N hexadecyl, and N octadecyl morpholines and alkyl substituted imidazoles such as N dodecylimidazole. A still further embodiment of the present invention comprises a compound of the formula M N A wherein M is a peptide substituent comprising z gly phe, gly phe, z arg arg, or benzoyl arg, and A or N A is an active lysosome inhibiting substance comprising a known therapeutic drug or an amino radical of the formula EMI9.1 in which R is an alkyl or substituted alkyl substituent of from 8 to 18 carbons and R2 is fluoroalkyl or hydrogen. Compounds of the type M N A are readily prepared by reaction of the selected amine with a selected peptide in the presence of a substance such as dicyclocarbodimide under anhydrous conditions. Compounds of this type are illustrated by the folding structural formulas in which the M substituent is a peptide described hereinabove Pertide derivatives of antibiotic 593A and analogs as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,718,651 of Gitterman et al. and U.S. Patent 3,840,542 of Shen et al.
