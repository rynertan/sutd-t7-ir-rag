# Method of inhibiting glycolysis in blood samples.

## Abstract
A method of inhibiting glycolysis in blood samples by adding an acid to the blood sample to adjust pH of the blood to a level between 5.0 and 7.0. Collected blood samples undergo glycolysis during stor age due to progress of the reaction with glycolytic enzymes with a result that glucose is reduced and lactic acid and pyru vic acid formed by the glycolysis is increased. The glycolysis as mentioned above can be inhibited simply by adjusting pH of the blood sample so that accurate determination of the above mentioned components are feasible. As the acid are preferred citric acid, malonic acid and maleic acid. Addition of citric acid to produce a level between 1.0 and 5.0 mg mâ„“ blood is especially preferable. Further addition of a fluoride compound, preferably NaF improves the glycolysis inhibiting action.
