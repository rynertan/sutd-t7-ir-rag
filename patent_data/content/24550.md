# Expandable composition based on EPDM rubber or polychloroprene and closed cell sponge rubber made therefrom.

## Abstract
An expandable composition of a solid synthetic vulcaniz able elastomer of ethylene higher alpha olefin nonconjugated diene copolymer or polychloroprene, a blow ing agent, and a curing agent for the elastomer, said composi tion containing from about 5 25 based on the weight of total polymer of an ionomer resin which is an ethylene polymer containing at least about 50 mole percent ethylene and bear ing from about 0.2 25 mole percent acid functional groups that are at least about 50 neutralized by metal ions.
