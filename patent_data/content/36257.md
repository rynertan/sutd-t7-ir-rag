## Description
EQUIPMENT FOR MONITORING A SIGNAL CURRENT IN ANELONGATE CONDUCTOR This invention relates to equipment for monitoring a signal current in an elongate conductor. According to this invention, there is provided equipment for monitoring a signal current in an elongate underground conductor, comprising first, second and third transducers each responsive to magnetic flux, the transducers being mounted in a spaced apart manner and having axes which are parallel to each other, so that in use they may be disposed relative to such a conductor with the said axes normal to the conductor, with the first transducer nearest the conductor, the third transducer furthest from the conductor and the second transducer between the first and third transducers, the equipment further comprising processing means for acting on outputs from the transducers to produce an indication of the amplitude of such signal current. The transducers could, for example, be coils.Alternatively, they could, for example, be Halleffect devices. The processing means could be arranged for processing a first signal, representative of a difference between a voltage from the third transducer and a voltage from the second transducer, and a second signal, representative of a difference between a voltage from the second transducer and a voltage from the first transducer. In the case that the transducers are coils, the third and second coils could then be wired in anti phase for producing the first signal and the second and first coils wired in anti phase for producing the second signal. The processing means could be arranged for producing an indication of a distance of the equipment from such a conductor. In this case, the processing means could then be arranged for producing the indication of the amplitude of such signal current by deriving an indication proportional to one of the first and second signals or a third signal, representative of a difference between a voltage from the first transducer and a voltage from the third transducer.Preferably, the processing means is arranged for producing an indication of the distance of such a conductor below the first transducer on the basis of the equation EMI2.1 where d is the said distance, s is the separation between the first and third transducers and vl, v2 and v3 are voltages from the firs, second and third transducers respectively, the second transducer being substantially midway between the first and third transducers. Preferably, the processing means includes means for applying a correction factor to compensate for variations of signal current magnetic field strength due to variations in depth of such a conductor. The processing means could include storage means for storing indications of the amplitude of such signal current. Moreover, the equipment could include display means for displaying a measure of the amplitude of such signal current. Where the equipment has these features and the feature of producing an indication of a distance from such a conductor to the equipment, the processing means and the display means could be such that there can be displayed on the display means measures of the said distance, the amplitude of such signal current, a difference in the amplitude of such signal current between two observation positions, the distance between the two positions and the rate of signal current attenuation negative or positive between those positions per unit length of conductor. The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of an example of equipment for monitoring a signal current in an elongate underground conductor Figure 2 shows how transducers of the equipment are mounted with a housing for processing means of the equipment Figure 3 is an enlarged view of the housing and Figure 4 is a plan view of a fascia of the housing. The equipment comprises three transducers 1,2 and 3 each responsive to magnetic flux, mounted on a support 4 in a spaced apart manner in the example, equi distantly spaced apart with a distance of about 23cm between transducers 2 and 1 and 3 and 2 with their axes parallel, so that in use they may be disposed above an elongate underground conductor 5 with their axes horizontal and with transducer 2 above transducer 1 and transducer 3 above transducer 2. The transducers are connected to a frequencyselective amplifier and switching matrix 6 in processing means in a housing 7. The processing means further includes an analogue meter 8 connected with an output of amplifier and switching matrix 6 a programmed microprocessor 9 connected with another output of the amplifier and matrix 6, an output of the microprocessor being connected with a gain control input 10 of the amplifier and matrix 6 a digital meter 11 connected with another output of the microprocessor 9 and a keyboard 12 connected with another input of the microprocessor 9.The housing 7 has a carrying handle 13 for the equipment. The purpose of the equipment is to indicate the plan position and depth or distance from the point of measurement hereafter referred to as the depth of the conductor 5, which could be a buried or submerged or otherwise obscured conductor, carrying a signal current, and to measure the amplitude of the signal current at intervals along its length, in order that the positions of local conductive paths between the conductor and its context may be located and quantified. Possible applications of such equipment are in respect of buried plant such as gas and oil transmission pipelines and electricity transmission cables, where exposure of the pipe wall or cable sheath to soil may result in its corrosion by electrolytic current flow between soil and metal.Such pipelines and cables are normally protected by being wrapped or sheathed by an electrically insulating material but such insulation may suffer local deficiencies in quality as a result of faulty manufacture, damage inflicted during installation, or thereafter by the environment. Where local exposure of metal exists, electrolytes in the soil or other context will almost certainly attack the metal, leading to pitting and possible eventual failure of the pipe or cable sheath wall. If an alternating signal current is applied to a buried insulated conductor, the equipment may be used to monitor the field intensity at intervals along the conductor s length, and from this data calculate the conductor s local signal current strengh, and indicate the reduction in signal current amplitude where a local deficiency of the insulator allows the escape of signal current to the context. The magnitude of the signal current escape gives an indication of the magnitude of the area of deficient insulat ion. The signal current, of controlled constant amplitude, may be applied to the conductor by direct conductive connection of a signal generator between the conductor and ground or, less commonly, by magnetic mutual induction with a field coil powered by a signal generator resulting in a voltage differential in a section of the conductor and consequent current flow in it due to the leakage paths from the conductor into the soil or other conductive context . The Biot and Savart Law 9 ki d states that the current flowing in a long straight conductor produces a magnetic field, in a medium of homogeneous permeability, which has flux vectors in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the conductor, in circles concentric with the conductor. The density of the flux vectors is directly proportional to the current amplitude, and inversely proportional to their radial distance from the axis of the conductor.Thus, cylindrical shells of equal flux density are formed co axially with the conductor. The signal current frequency should not be so high as to create strong induced secondary currents in conductors nearby the conductor under investigation, nor so low that excessively elaborate and highly sensitive amplifiers are necessary to pick up the signal magnetic field. Neither should the signal frequency be such that equipment is liable to pick up 50 and 60Hz electricity supply harmonics. A frequency which has proved to have good field experimental operating characteristics is around 1000Hz although certain insulating materials may require a lower signal frequency, e.g.epoxy coatings. The transducers 1,2 and 3 may be of any type having an electrical property or output dependent upon magnetic flux or magnetic flux intensity change, or a function of magnetic flux intensity.For example, Hall effect devices might prove suitable.However, it has been found that the most practical form of each transducer is a coil, which may be air cored, or cored by some magnetic material such as iron or ferrite. With the transducers 1,2 and 3 one above the other as shown in Figure 1, with horizontal axes parallel to each other and directly over the conductor 5, the following formula exists EMI6.1 or alternatively s tv2 v31 d 1v1 2v2 v31 where d is the depth to the conductor axis, s is the separation between transducers 1 and 3, and vl, v2 and v3 are the output voltages of transducers 1,2 and 3 respectively. Although a position for transducer 2 midway between transducers 1 and 3 is the most convenient, other positions might be chosen for reasons of layout contraint and formulae for these other positions could be easily devised.If the transducers 1,2 and 3 are coils, the coils 2 and 3 are wired in anti phase to produce v2 v3 to be fed to the processing means and coils 1 and 2 are wired in anti phase to produce vl v2 to beefed to the processing means. Alternatively, a subtraction of v2 from vl and a subtraction of v3 from v2 could be carried out in the processing means. As the depth to the conductor 5 increases, so the signal current magnetic field intensity at the transducers decreases, and vice versa, so in order to display the true signal current amplitude, the processing means must incorporate means of correcting the received field intensity for variations in depth to the conductor. Since the field intensity is proportional to 1 depth, by adjusting the processing means amplifier gain by a like factor or by otherwise multiplying the received voltages , variations in field strength due to depth differences may be almost exactly compensated. It could be convenient in practice to take a standard calibration depth and signal current strength of, say, 1 metre and 500 milliamps respectively though any distance or current value might be used for this purpose . If 500mA is flowing in the conductor, and the depth is 1 metre, at a gain setting of 2, the depth divided by the gain setting 1 2 0.5A. When the depth increases to, say, 1.75 metres, the displayed signal strength at an unaltered gain setting would be 500 x 1 1.75 286mA. If, however, the gain or other field strength compensating means is arranged such that a signal magnification factor equal to the depth 1.75 is applied in the processing means, the signal current will read as 286 x 1.75 500mA.The gain or magnification factor will now be 2.0 x 1 75 3.5. If the depth at a third position over the conductor is 2.lm and the signal current amplitude has fallen through current escape to the soil through an insulation defect to, say, 341mA, the depth will still read 2 lem see equations above .The signal field strength will be displayed as 341 x 1 2.1 162.4 at a gain setting of 2.0 .Applying the depth correction factor in this case 2.1 in the processing means will result in the display reading the true signal current amplitude, i.e. 162.4 x 2.1 341mA. The gain setting will now be 2.0 x 2.1 4.2. This depth magnification compensationfactor can be almost instantly applied to any depth variation within the range of the equipment. However, such a procedure requires that an absolute field intensity be measured at one transducer position, since the reciprocal field intensity law applies to the absolute field intensity and not to the field intensity gradient between two transducer positions. It will be appreciated that the use of a single transducer and the reciprocal depth law requiring an absolute field intensity measurement as a reference to which the depth correction factor is applied, will risk the result being vitiated byAC magnetic field interference from such sources as power cables and transformers. The advantage of using difference measurements between pairs of transducers is that such interference is virtually cancelled once the signal current voltage output difference between such a pair becomes the basis of measurements. The relatively nearby signal source i.e. the conductor produces a reasonable signal difference voltage, whereas interference sources even a few metres more distant will produce almost equal output voltages at the transducers, and therefore negligible difference outputs. Thus, as a three element or there could be more transducer array is employed in this equipment, no absolute field strength measurement is required, and the system is highly insensitive to general AC magnetic field interference and consequent false results. The amplitude difference between the difference outputs of transducer pairs 1 and 2, and 2 and 3, becomes relatively smaller with increasing distance from the conductor than does the absolute field intensity decline with distance.Accordingly, the equipment must be programmed to increase the signal field multiplication factor to a greater amount than the reciprocal of the depth, where the interference reducing three transducer array is employed, the correction being applied by the microprocessor 9 via the input 10. The correction factor here is d2 d.s f d s where vl v3 x f d is a constant, d depth and s the distance normally the vertical separation between the transducers employed in making the differential current measurement preferably transducers 1 and 3 . If vl v3 is used in the processing means to produce a measure of signal current amplitude, the latter being derived from transducers 1 and 3, the difference is obtained in the processing means by subtracting v3 from vl. Since the normal current losses to ground along a long insulated conductor are quasi exponential in character, it is the successive current amplitude ratios at successive observation points that are of significance in determining.the existence and magnitude of insulation faults. Consequently, the equipment is so arranged that pushing the keyA attenuation of keyboard 12 causes the displayed current amplitude to be stored in memory in the microprocessor. This current is then either a multiplied by zero if the memory is empty i.e.is reading zero or b is divided by the preexisting memory current value i.e. that current value recorded at the previous observation location and the operation 20 log of this value applied.This gives the current attenuation in decibels between the present and preceding locations.Alternatively, the operation 2000 log will give the result in millibels, which is a more convenient unit for the expression of the rate of current loss per metre see below , or for short sections of conductor where the amount of current escape is comparatively low. Thus presented, a given rate of attenuation figure rate of attenuation is the attenuation between two observation positions divided by the distance between them will represent a particular state of insulation condition, regardless of the fact that the absolute current loss through an insulation defect will be the greater, the nearer the defect is to the signal current application position. In other words, it is the ratio of the signal current amplitudes at successive observation positions that is significant in quantifying an insulation defect, rather than the absolute amount of the current escape.An example will show a possible sequence of events EMI11.1 At SEP Current SEP Current SEP Displayed SEP Attenuation SEP Distance SEP Attenuation tb Position SEP Amplitude SEP Amplitude SEP Current SEP Over SEP Last SEP m SEP per SEP metre tb Reads SEP In SEP Memory SEP divided SEP by SEP Section SEP mB m tb Memory SEP x SEP 20 SEP log tb Current tb 1 SEP 873 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 SEP 0 tb 2 SEP 679 SEP 873 SEP 0.78 SEP 2.18 SEP 857 SEP 0.25 tb 3 SEP 512 SEP 679 SEP 0.75 SEP 2.45 SEP 644 SEP 0.38 tb 4 SEP 491 SEP 512 SEP 0.96 SEP 0.36 SEP 192 SEP 0.19 tb 5 SEP 428 SEP 491 SEP 0.87 SEP 1.19 SEP 579 SEP 0.21 tb 6 SEP 355 SEP 428 SEP 0.38 SEP 1.62 SEP 454 SEP 0.36 tb Thus, at each observation position the equipment operator can immediately obtain the following results 1. Press key D depth The digital meter 11 of keyboard 12 displays the depth distance to the conduc tor usually in metres .2. Press key C current The digital meter 11 of keyboard 12 displays signal current amplitude usually in milliamperes .3. Press key A attenuat The processing means ion of keyboard 12 multiplies the displayed current level by zero if the memory is empty, or divides displayed current by the current value in the memory i.e. the previous observation position current value . The displayed current value is entered into memory. The log of displayed current divided by memory current is calculated, multiplied by 20, and displayed. This is the attenuation in signal current in decibels, between the previous observation position and the present one. Alternatively, the signal currents may be logged and multip lied by 20 before further computation, and the latest observation sub tracted from the previous to give signal current attenuation in decibels.4. Press keys 1,2,3,4, The meter 11 displays representing distance distance 1234 metres . from previous position of the keyboard 12 5. Press key U of The processing means keyboard 12 divides attenuation by distance and multiplies the result by 100. The meter 11 reads attenuation per unit distance from previous observation position for example in millibels per metre mB m .The transducer array must be aligned correctly with respect to the signal magnetic field before current strength observations may be carried out. This is accomplished by observing the analogue meter 8. When it is suspected that the conductor is nearby, the equipment is rotated in azimuth.The meter 8 will indicate a maximum signal when the transducer axes are at right angles in plan to the axis of the signal current carrying conductor.Then, by moving the equipment along the line of the transducer axes thus oriented, the conductor position is indicated by a further maximum analogue meter reading. The observation of signal current strength may then be carried out. Alternatively, two subsidiary coils, ferrite or air cored, one vertical and one horizontal, could be on the equipment for detecting by indications on meter 8 when.the transducers are at right angles to the conductor 5 and directly over the latter.
