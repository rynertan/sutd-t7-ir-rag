## Description
This invention relates to a method for determining the presence in a mammal of a cancer associated antigen, an antibody preparation, and a protein preparation for use in producing the antibody preparation. In spite of improved treatments for certain forms of cancer, it is still the second leading cause of death in the United States. Since the chance for complete remission of cancer is, in most cases, greatly enhanced by early diagnosis, it is very desirable that physicians be able to detect cancers before a substantial tumor develops. Also, in cases where the primary tumor has been substantially removed by surgery or destroyed by other means, it is important that the physician be capable of detecting any trace of cancer in the patient either in the form of residues of the primary tumor or of secondary tumors caused by metastasis , in order that the physician can prescribe appropriate subsequent treatment, such as chemotherapy. The quantities of cancer cells which must be detected for early diagnosis or following removal or destruction of the primary tumor are so small that the physician cannot rely upon physical examination of the cancer site moreover, in many cases the cancer site is of course not susceptible of direct visual observation and it is almost always impractical to detect secondary tumors by visual observation, since it is not possible to predict exactly where they are likely to occur. Accordingly, sensitive tests have to rely upon detection of cancer associated materials, usually proteins, present in body fluids of patients who have, or about to develop, small numbers of cancer cells in their bodies. Diagnostic materials for detection of at least two cancer associated proteins are already available commercially. Tests for alpha fetoprotein are used to detect primary liver cancer and teratocarcinoma in humans. Similarly, carcinoembryonic antigen is used for diagnosis of cancers of the digestive system. Unfortunately, such tests are only applicable to a narrow range of cancer types, and therefore these tests suffer not only from the disadvantage that other types of cancer may be missed but also from the disadvantage that the narrow applicability of the tests means that it may be necessary to run multiple tests on a single patient for diagnostic purposes, a procedure which not only increases the expense of the diagnostic testing but also increases the risk that one or other of the test may give a false positive result. Accordingly, there is a need for a single chemical test able to detect the presence of very small amounts of cells of a wide variety of different cancers. It is already known that serum from the blood of animals suffering from a wide variety of cancers contains a protein hereinafter referred to as cancer marker protein having a molecular weight of approximately 60,000 and having the capacity to increase the release of ribonucleic acid RNA form cell nuclei see Further work on detection of this cancer associated antigen is described in Schumm and Webb, Putative Transformation dependent proteins in the blood plasma of tumor bearing rats and cancer patients, Cancer Research, One method often used for detection of proteins and other antigens is radioimmunoassay. In this technique, a sample of the material to be assayed is mixed with a known quantity of a radioactive labeled form of the antigen to be measured. The resultant mixture is then treated with antibody to the antigen being assayed, thereby forming an antigen antibody complex. The degree of radioactivity of this complex depends upon the amount of the appropriate antigen in the sample being assayed and thus, by measuring the radioactivity of the complex, the quantity of the antigen in the sample may be determined. Another method for the detection of proteins and other antigens is known as an ELISA assay. In this assay, the walls of wells in a culture plate are coated with an antibody to the antigen to be assayed and the wells are then washed. A specimen of the material to be tested is placed in the coated wells, incubated for a period sufficient to allow any antigen present to react with the antibody on the walls, and after incubation the wells are again washed out. Next, there is added to the wells a conjugate of the antibody and horseradish peroxidase, the plates are incubated and washed out, and a mixture of hydrogen peroxide in a buffer and 2,2 AzinoDi 3 Ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonic Acid ABTS and the plates are allowed to develop for ten minutes at room temperature. The reaction was then stopped by the addition of 2mM sodium azide solution. If the antigen being assayed i.e. that specific to the antibody is not present in the test material, no color will be formed in the wells of the plates because the peroxidase enzyme will have been washed away. If, however, the antigen being assayed is present in the test material immunological reactions will cause the enzyme to adhere to the walls of the wells and this enzyme will cause formation of a color with the hydrogen peroxide ABTS mixture. Thus, the formation of color at the end of the test is indicative of the presence of the antigen. Like radioimmunoassay, this assay technique requires the preparation of an antibody specific to the antigen being assayed and the preparation of this antibody requires purification of the antigen. The present invention provides a method for determining the presence in a mammal of a cancer associated antigen, this method being based upon that described in the papers referred to above. This invention also provides an antibody preparation for use in this method, and a protein preparation useful for preparing this antigen. Accordingly, this invention provides a method for determining the presence in a mammal of a cancer associated antigen, the method comprising The term RNA releasing activity as used herein refers to activity determined by the following procedure. Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing approximately 250 grams are fasted for 18 hours. For the preparation of cytosol, the rat livers are dissected out, homogenized in a volume of 0.25 M sucrose TMK buffer which is twice the wet weight milliliters gram of the livers. The TMK buffer used has the following composition The homogenate is centrifuged at 100,000g for 90 minutes and the supernatant removed and dialyzed overnight against TMK buffer. For the preparation of nuclei, rats are injected with 50 micro curies of 6 ¹⁴C orotic acid specific activity 323 micro curies milligram this material is available from New England Nuclear Corporation, Boston, Massachusetts as described in the aforementioned paper in Cancer Res., 33 1821 1828 1973 . After a 30 minute prelabelling, the rat livers are dissected out, homogenized in a volume of 2.3M sucrose 3.3mM calcium acetate aqueous solution which is 15 times the weight of the liver. This homogenate is centrifuged at 34,000g for 60 minutes at 4 C. The nuclear pellet is washed with a solution containing 1M sucrose lmM calcium acetate and resuspended in the same solution. The cytosol remaining after dialysis is then used to prepare a cell free system containing 5 x 10⁶ prelabeled nuclei per milliliter of medium containing 5 milligram of dialyzed cytosol protein per milliliter and having the following additional components This invention also provides an antibody preparation substantially free of antibodies to normal plasma fraction and characterized in that it is precipitated by 35 saturated aqueous ammonium sulfate solution, and is capable of forming a conjugate with a cancer associated phosphoprotein derived from a mammal and having the characteristics Finally, this invention provides a protein preparation comprising a cancer associated phosphoprotein derived from a mammal and having the following characteristics As already mentioned, this invention provides a protein preparation comprising a purified form of the aforementioned cancer marker protein and having an RNA releasing activity of at least 10 units per milligram of total protein in the preparation. The RNA releasing activity of the instant protein preparation is desirably about 10 units per milligram of total protein in the preparation. Typically in the purification of the cancer marker protein from humans, the dialyzed protein from the second step of the purification process will have an activity of about 0.84 units per milligram of protein, the 60,000 molecular weight fraction from the third step of the purification process will have an activity of about 2.66 units per milligram of total protein and the final material will have an activity of about 20 units per milligram of protein. In the purification of the cancer marker protein from rats, the dialyzed protein from the second step will have an activity of about 1.4 units per milligram, the 60,000 molecular weight fraction from the third step will have an activity of about 8.1 units per milligram and the final material will have an activity of about 71 units per milligram. It should be noted that one cannot correlate the increase in specific activity of the protein during the various stages of the purification process directly with the degree of purification affected, since it appears that the cancer marker protein does lose some of its RNA releasing activity during the purification process, and especially in the final step thereof. It is necessary that the protein preparation be substantially free of albumin since albumin is strongly immunogenic and thus any albumin in the instant protein preparation would produce antibody serum heavily contaminated with albumin antibodies. Although the characteristics are already specified are believed to define the instant cancer marker protein uniquely, it should be noted that various other properties of the cancer marker protein have been observed and further characterize this protein. The cancer marker protein is fairly stable, retaining full biochemical activity and showing little or no change in size during storage in plasma at 20 C for at least three years. However, the protein is heat labile, being completely destroyed by heating to 65 C for 10 minutes. The protein has little or no single strand ribonuclease activity and electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel suggests that it consists of a single polypeptide chain since a single band appears in the 60,000 molecular weight region. As already mentioned, the first stage in the instant method for preparing the purified cancer marker protein is separating from the serum of a mammal suffering from cancer the fraction of serum protein which is not precipitated by 30 saturated aqueous ammonium sulfate solution. Since the purpose of the ammonium sulfate precipitattion step is to remove low molecular weight material, one can use the whole fraction precipitating between 30 and 100 saturation. However, in general it is preferred to use the fraction precipitating between 30 and 60 saturation, since this fraction contains substantially all the cancer marker protein. The instant cancer marker protein preparations can be isolated from both humans and other mammals, and the protein preparations from different species appear to be generally similar in molecular weight and other chemical properties. However, the cancer marker proteins from different species The second, dialysis step of the instant purification process is desirably conducted at a pH in the range of about 7 to about 8. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the dialysis is conducted by dispersing the plasma protein fraction in a tris hydroxymethylamino methane potassium chloride magnesium chloride buffer having a pH of about 7.5 and dialyzing the resultant protein solution against the same buffer. Overnight dialysis normally provides sufficient purification in this step of the instant process. In the third step of the instant purification process, the fraction of the protein having a molecular weight of about 60,000 is separated. Although, as already noted, the molecular weight of the cancer marker protein is about 60,000, the fractions eluting in the molecular weight range of 55,000 to 70,000 should usually be collected to ensure reasonably complete recovery of the protein. Separation of the 60,000 molecular weight fraction of protein can be achieved using centrifugation, but is is preferred that this separation be effected by chromatography of the dialyzed protein from the second step of the instant process on a molecular seive solid phase. Those skilled in the art will be aware of a variety of molecular sieve materials which can be used for this purpose the preferred molecular sieve material is the cross linked resin available commercially under the trade name Sepharose CL 6B. The liquid phase in the chromatography process is preferably the same TMK buffer used in the aforementioned preferred embodiment of the dialysis step. However, following the chromatography step the purified cancer marker protein is still contaminated by a considerable amount of serum albumin molecular weight about 68,000 . Accordingly, to remove this impurity it is preferred that the instant purification process includes the step of treating the 60,000 molecular weight protein fraction obtained from the third step to remove albumin therefrom. The preferred method for removal of albumin without causing any deleterous effects on the cancer marker protein itself is chromatography on a solid medium capable of absorbing albumin, and a preferred medium for this purpose is that available commercially under the trade name CM Affi Gel Blue obtainable from Bio Rad Lab., Richmond, California . It should be noted that, once one batch of the purified cancer marker protein has been isolated and a serum containing antibodies thereto produced, the purification of later batches of cancer marker protein can be enhanced by treating the purified cancer marker protein isolated from the molecular sieve chromatography step before or after removal of albumin therefrom with the antibody containing serum. As those skilled in the art are aware, this treatment will cause precipitation of a cancer marker protein antibody complex which can then be separated, for example by centrifugation, and broken down by methods familiar to those skilled in the art to yield the purified cancer marker protein and the antibody for example the protein antibody complex may be broken down on a column of protein A agarose sold by BRL, Gaithersburg, MD directions for use of this material are supplied by the manufacturer . As already mentioned, to produce a serum containing antibodies to the cancer marker protein, the purified protein is introduced into the bloodstream of a mammal and allowed to remain in the mammal for at least seven days, blood is removed from the mammal and serum prepared from this blood. To produce high levels of antibodies to the cancer marker protein, it is preferred that the purified protein be introduced into the bloodstream of the mammal together with an immunostimulating adjuvant, complete or incomplete Freund s adjuvant being efficacious for this purpose. The purified protein is desirably introduced into the mammal by intradermal injection, and a preferred administration routine comprises a primary immunization with the purified cancer marker protein and immunostimulating adjuvant, followed by a second immunization with the protein preparation and an immunostimulating adjuvant at least seven days after the primary immunization, the blood being removed from the mammal at least three days after the second immunization. A convenient mammal for use in the process is a rabbit. In order to produce an antibody containing serum which is specific for the cancer marker protein, the serum prepared from the blood of the immunized mammal is absorbed with normal plasma fraction, thereby eliminating all antibodies produced to normal components of plasma which have carried through the purification process, and producing a purified antibody preparation which is specific to the cancer marker protein. Even after the instant purification process, the cancer marker protein still contains traces of immunogenic impurities, so that the antibody produced by passage through the mammal is polyclonal. The absorption with normal plasma fraction removes the antibodies to normal plasma components, thereby ensuring that the antibodies are specific for the cancer marker protein and will not react with normal plasma components to give false positive results when the antibody is used for diagnostic tests as described below. The antibody produced after adsorption with normal plasma fraction gives a single precipitin line when reacted with the cancer marker protein and thus appears to be monospecific for the cancer marker protein. The antibody thus prepared may be used to test for the presence of cancer marker protein in serum from suspected cancer patients by a variety of conventional tests. Thus, the antibody may be used in a radioimmunoassay, the technique for which has already been described above. The radio labeled cancer marker protein needed for this test may be prepared from the instant cancer marker protein preparation using a procedure described by Ganguli and Hunter in Radioimmune Assay Methods European Workshop, 1970 . This radio labeling technique involves mixing sodium iodide containing ¹²⁵I phosphate buffer having a pH of 7.5, the cancer marker protein and chloramine T, incubating for 30 seconds and stopping the labeling reaction with metabisulfate and potassium iodide. The radio labeled cancer marker protein can be separated from the reaction mixture by chromatography on Sephadex G 50. The following examples are now given, though by way of illustration only, to show details of particularly preferred reagents and techniques used in the instant processes. This example illustrates the instant process for purification of the cancer marker protein. Plasma obtained from ten human patients having cancers at eight different sites was pooled, then fractionated with ammonium sulfate. The protein precipitating between 30 and 50 saturation of the aqueous ammonium sulfate solution, which fraction was found to contain all the RNA releasing activity, was dissolved in approximately 5ml of the aforementioned TMK buffer, then dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. An aliquot of the dialyzed solution containing approximately 150mg. of total protein was applied to a 1.5 x 90cm. column of the molecular sieve resin, Sepharose CL 6B. The column was eluted with the aforementioned TMK buffer and 3ml fractions were collected. A 200 microliter aliquot of each even numbered fraction was assayed for RNA releasing activity as described above. For control purposes, an exactly similar procedure was followed with pooled plasma from 10 persons who were not suffering from cancer. The results of the assay are shown in Fig. 1, in which the broken line shows the results obtained from the cancer patients and the continuous line shows the results obtained from the healthy individuals. It will be seen from Fig. 1 that the two profiles are completely different, the cancer patients showing a very strong peak at around 60,000 molecular weight, which is completely absent from the profile of the normal patients. At about fraction number 30, the protein from the cancer patients was showing an increased activity in the assay of approximately 8.5 , equal to an activity of 10 units per milligram of protein in the aliquot. Further purification of the fractions eluting from the molecular sieve column at a molecular weight of 55,000 70,000 was effected by a further chromatography on a 1.0 x 10.0cm column of CM Affi Gel Blue, in order to remove albumin from the purified cancer marker protein. A sample containing 25.0mg of protein was suspended in the aforementioned TMK buffer, loaded onto the column and eluted with 0.4M potassium chloride TMK buffer. Dialysis of eluate and electrophoresis on sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel confirmed that this treatment substantially completely removed albumin from the purified cancer marker preparation. The electrophoretograms produced only a single band corresponding to the cancer marker protein, suggesting that this protein is composed of a single polypeptide chain. Since it is known that certain cancer associated proteins are oncofetal proteins, and since earlier research had indicated that the plasma from pregnant women showed an abnormally high activity in the RNA releasing activity test, plasma from a pregnant woman was subjected to the purification process already described. The profile obtained is shown in Fig. 2. From this figure, it will be seen that the 60,000 molecular weight peak associated with the cancer marker protein is completely absent from the plasma of the pregnant woman and the the RNA releasing activity of the serum is associated with a peak at a molecular weight of 25,000. Accordingly, it appears that the cancer marker protein is completely absent from the plasma of pregnant women and thus pregnancy should not interfere with the instant radioimmunoassay test. This example illustrates the instant process for the preparation of an antibody. The purified cancer marker protein prepared as described in Example 1 was dissolved in normal saline at a concentration of 1.5 milligram of protein per milliliter. 1 ml. of this normal saline solution was then emulsified with 1 ml. of complete Freund s adjuvant using an omni mixer with a microcontainer immersed in an ice water bath. The 2 ml. of emulsion thus produced was injected into multiple intradermal sites on the shaved backs of young adult New Zealand white rabbits. This primary immunization was followed by the second immunization approximately 30 days later, the second immunization being performed by the same method as the first except that incomplete Freund s adjuvant was substituted for complete Freund s adjuvant. The animals were bled 1, 2 and 3 weeks after the second immunization and immunodiffusion analyses were conducted to determine the potency and specificity of the antisera obtained. The antisera prepared were absorbed with normal plasma fraction to produce an antibody specific to the cancer marker protein.
