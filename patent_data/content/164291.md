# SYSTEM AND PROCESS FOR MEASURING FIBERGLASS

## Abstract
The invention relates to a system and a process for measuring fiberglass. The process consists in directing a beam of radiation into the fiberglass, the beam including at least first, second and third wavelengths of radiation all generated by the same source 10 , measuring the intensity of the beam at said first, second and third wavelengths after the beam has been trans mittted through the fiberglass 18 , and thus determining the property of the fiberglass 18 based upon the measured in tensities of said three wavelengths. Application to the determination of the degree of one of a fiberglass.
