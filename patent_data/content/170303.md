# An electric power supply system for portable miniature size power consuming devices.

## Abstract
An electric power supply system for portable minitiature size power consuming devices, comprising an AC generator, a rechargeable battery and a charging device to be fed from the AC generator and maintaining the battery charging level, the AC generator comprising a multi polar rotor wheel having permanently magnetised poles, and stator having one or more windings providing the AC current and an eccentric mass driving the permanently magnetised rotor wheel the rotor wheel, the stator and the eccentric mass being mounted coaxially, a transmission being arranged between the eccentric mass and the rotor wheel. According to the invention the transmission is a loose coupling means to be tightened by magnetic fields between the poles of the rotor wheel and the respective poles of the stator.
