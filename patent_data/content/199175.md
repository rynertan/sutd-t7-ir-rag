## Description
This invention relates to polymeric electrodes. More particularly, this invention relates to negative electrodes for non aqueous secondary batteries composed of conjugated backbone polymers and alkali metal alloying or alkali metal ion inserting materials. Conjugated backbone polymers, e.g., polyacetylene, polyphenylene, polyacenes, polythiophene, poly phenylene vinylene , polyazulene, poly phenylene sulfide , poly phenylene oxide , polythianthrene, poly phenyl quinoline , polyaniline, polythiophene, and polypyrrole, have been suggested for use in a variety of applications based upon their characteristic of becoming conductive when oxidized or reduced either chemically or electrochemically. The secondary battery application described by, e.g., MacDiarmid et al. in U.S. Patent 4,321,114 1981 Lithium and lithium alloys have been suggested for use on the negative electrode of electrochemical cells. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,002,492 discloses electrochemical cells having an anode consisting essentially of lithium aluminum alloys that contain lithium in amounts between about 63 and 92 and the balance essentially aluminium. Anodes composed of lithium and aluminum are also disclosed in Rao, et al., European Patent No. 0070107 Al Murphy et al., Composite structures of a conjugated backbone poly mer and a non electroactive material have been described in U.S. Patent No. 4,294,304 and in the above J. O. Besenhard and G. Eichinger, J. Electroanal. Chem., While batteries have heretofore been constructed in which a conjugated backbone polymer is the electroactive material, such batteries suffer from a number of disad vantages. For example, such cells have heretofore exhibited strongly varying discharge potentials. More over, such cells have relatively low volumetric energy densities. Batteries to be used at room temperature construc ted with anodes composed of alkali metal alloys, such as lithium aluminum alloys, also suffer from a number of disadvantages. For example, such batteries have exhi bited relatively low capacity utilization , low rate capability and poor cycle life. Generally speaking, the present invention obviates one or more of the disadvantages of the prior art poly mer batteries or alloy anode batteries by providing an improved anode for high energy density electrochemical cells which include a cathode containing a cathode active material, an anode containing an anode active material, and a non aqueous electrolyte having an ionic salt of the anode active material dissolved therein. More particularly, the improved anode of this invention comprises an anode active material selected from the group consisting of a metal capable of alloying with sodium and a mixture comprising a conjugated backbone polymer or copolymer or a blend of a conjugated polymer with one or more conjugated or non conjugated backbone polymers and a material selected from the group consisting of metals capable of alloying with an alkali metal and alkali metal cation inserting materials. The present invention also provides a battery incorporting the novel anode of this invention, which battery comprises As an essential component, the battery of this invention includes an anode which comprises a unique anode active material. One unique anode active material useful in the battery of this invention comprises a mix ture of one or more conjugated backbone polymers or copolymers, or blends of one or more conjugated polymers or copolymers with one or more conjugated or non conju gated backbone polymers or copolymers hereinafter referred to collectively as conjugated backbone poly mer , which polymers, copolymers or blends contain an effective amount of one or more other potential electro active materials selected from the group consisting of metals which are capable of alloying with alkali metals and materials capable of inserting alkali metal cations. The structure of this anode can be varied widely. For example, the anode can be in the form of an intimate mixture of compressed powders. Alternatively, the anode can be in the form of a film of the conjugated backbone polymer impregnated with the other component in finely divided form, or in the form of a composite layered structure in which one of the components is a core structure encapsulated by and in intimate contact with the other component. In the preferred embodiments, the anode is in the form of an intimate mixture of com pressed powders, or a casting of the polymer having par ticles of the other electroactive material dispersed therein. Useful polymers may be any of the variety of con jugated backbone polymers known to those of skill in the art for use as negative electrodes in batteries. Such polymers are preferably conductive in their reduced form and capable of reversibly inserting cations. Useful polymers are also insoluble or substantially insoluble in the electrolyte i.e., preferably a solubility equal to or less than about 500 ppm . Useful conjugated back bone polymers may be conjugated backbone homopolymers or copolymers, or blends of one or more conjugated backbone homopolymers or copolymers with one or more conjugated backbone or non conjugated backbone homopolymers or copolymers. Useful conjugated backbone polymers can vary widely and include polyacetylene, polyphenylene, if in the para form , poly phenylene vinylene and the like, and blends thereof with other polymers having either conjugated or non conjugated backbones, such as polyethylene. Other conjugated backbone polymers claimed by others as useful in batteries may also be used in the present invention. Such polymers include polythiophene, polyazulene, poly phenylquinoline , polyacenes, polyacenediyls, polynaphthalene, and the like and polymeric blends thereof. Amongst these illustrative conjugated backbone polymers, polyacety lene, poly phenylene vinylene and poly p phenylene are preferred, and polyacetylene and poly p phenylene are particularly preferred. Most preferred for use in the practice of this invention is polyacetylene. Useful conjugated backbone polymers are known com pounds which can be prepared by conventional means. For example, high quality polyacetylene, a preferred conju gated backbone polymer, can be conveniently prepared by the procedures described in a series of papers by Shirakawa, et al., The second essential component of this unique anode material is a material selected from the group consist ing of metals or alloys which are capable of alloying with alkali metals, and materials which are capable of inserting alkali metal cations. Useful alkali metal alloying metals can vary widely. Illustrative of such useful metals are aluminium, lead, magnesium, tin, bismuth, antimony, silicon, and alloys of these or other metals, such as Al Si, Al Mg, Al Si Sn, or Wood s Metal Bi Pb Sn Cd and the like. The preferred alkali metal alloying metals for use in the practice of this inven tion are aluminum, lead, tin and alloys thereof. In the particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, aluminum is used for lithium alloying, and lead, tin and tin lead alloys are used for sodium alloying. Alkali metal cation inserting materials can vary widely. As used herein, alkali metal cation inserting materials are materials into which alkali metal cations can be inserted, as for example, into channels in the material, between layers of the material and the like. Such materials are known to those of skill in the art. Such materials include but are not limited to graphite, transition metal chalcogenides, and other conjugated backbone polymers which are capable of being reduced, i.e., donor doped. Preferred cation inserting materials are transition metal chalcogenides such as TiS₂, MoO₂, WO₂, VSe₂, FeCuS₂, and VS₂,. The amounts of the various components of the anode material can vary widely, depending on a number of factors, as for example, the balance chosen between electrochemical capacity, and the desired mechanical properties of the anode, electrode, and the like. In general, the amount of the conjugated backbone polymer component in the anode should be sufficient to impart mechanical stability and good cycle life to the electrode. In the preferred embodiments of this aspect of the invention, the amount of the conjugated backbone polymer component may vary from about 5 to about 75 percent by weight based on the total weight of polymer and other electroactive material in the anode, and in the particularly preferred embodiments up from about 20 to about 50 by weight on the aforementioned basis. Similarly, the amount of the other electroactive material in this aspect of the invention e.g., alkali metal alloying material and or inserting material can also vary widely depending on a number of factors, as for example, the balance chosen between electrochemical capacity and the desired mechanical properties of the electrode and the like. Usually the amount of such material varies from about 25 to about 95 weight percent based on the total weight of conjugated backbone polymer and other electroactive material. In the preferred embodiments of the invention, the amount of the other material may vary from about 50 to about 80 weight percent on the aforemention basis. The particular polymer and alloying metal and or cation inserting material chosen for use in any par ticular situation may vary widely. However, in the preferred embodiments of the invention the polymer and other electroactive material are selected such that the range of electroactivity of the polymer encompasses or closely matches that of the other component. The following table lists exemplary combinations of conjugated backbone polymer and alkali metal alloying metal or alkali metal cation inserting material which can be used in this aspect of the anode of this invention. The anode of this invention comprises a mixture of conjugated backbone polymer and one or more other electroactive material may include other optional materials known to those of skill in the battery art. These materials are known to those of skill in the art and will not be described herein in great detail. In brief, by way of illustrative examples, the anode may include such other substituents as conductivity aids, inert binders, mechanical supports, and the like. However, in the preferred embodiments, the combination of polymer plus other electroactive material is in the major proportion. The anode of this invention comprises a mixture of conjugated backbone polymer and one or more other electroactive material may also be coated with other materials to allow use of the anode with solvents which would otherwise react with the conjugated backbone polymer in the reduced state. For example, the anode can be coated with the reaction product of an oxirane compound as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,472,487, with the reaction product of an organsulfur compound as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,472,489 and with the reaction product of certain cyclic compounds as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,472,488. Each of these patents are incorporated herein by reference. The method of fabricating the anode of this inven tion which comprises a mixture of conjugated backbone polymer and other electroactive material is not critical and can be varied widely. Any method known to those of skill in the art for fabricating composites of polymer and a metal or alkali metal ion inserting material can be used. In the preferred embodiments, the anode is composed of an intimate mixture of compressed powders which is prepared through use of the process of this invention. In this process, the anode is fabricated by 1 derivatizing the surface of a finely divided alkali metal alloying metal or alkali metal cation inserting material with active polymer catalyst for conjugated backbone polymers or a catalyst for polymers which can be converted into a conjugated backbone polymer 2 dispersing the derivatized metal or material having a desired small particle size in a suspension or solution of a monomer and or a precursor of the desired conju gated backbone polymer and polymerizing the monomer and or precursor in the presence of the dispersed metal or material and 3 fabricating a cohesive solid by recovering the polymerization product and derivatized metal or material from the polymerization mixture from said suspension or solution and compressing same into a powdered composite, or by casting a film of suspension or gel like composition comprising the polymerization product, and metal or material. For substrates having a surface suitable for anchoring polymerization catalysts, the first step of the process is the derivatization of the substrate surface by a component of a catalyst system that is active in polymerization reactions forming conjugated backbone polymers or polymers which can be converted to conjugated backbone polymers. The derivatization is performed by contacting a catalyst component with a substrate whose surface contains reactive function alities such as oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, hydrogen sulfides and the like. For example, when the substrate consists of a metal, often the surface of the metal pos sess an oxide hydroxide layer which may react with a suitable catalyst component such as AlCl₃, Ti O nBu ₄, MoOCl₄, MoCl₅ or WCl₆, to yield a metal substrate bonded at the surface via its oxide layer to a modified cata lyst component according to the equation Metal OH AX For those substrates that do not possess a surface layer which reacts with suitable catalyst components and that are not polymerization catalysts themselves, the process requires a pretreatment of the substrate to introduce surface functional groups such oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, carboxylic acids and the like. Reagents for pretreatment include nitric acid, chromic acid, alkali metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal oxides, alkali metal sulfides, anhydrides and the like. Derivatization of the treated surface can then proceed as above. For the substrate whose surface is catalytic for polymerization, derivatization is not required and the substrate and the monomers or precursors are merely contacted in a suitable medium. For example, Na In the preferred embodiments of the invention in which the process is used to prepare an anode containing a finely divided electroactive material dispersed in a conjugated backbone polymeric matrix, the substrate is a finely divided metal, alloy or other electroactive material. Preferred metals and alloys include aluminium, lithium aluminum alloys, lead, tin, tin lead alloys and other metal and alloys which can alloy with alkali metals. Other useful and preferred electroactive materials which can be used in the manufacture of anodes are the transition metal chalcogenides. Such chalco genides for use in the practice of this invention can vary widely and include WO₂, MoO₂, Li In these preferred embodiments of the invention, the powdered metal, alloy or other electroactive material generally has an average particle diameter of from about 100um to about 0.05um. In the preferred embodiments of the invention, average particle diameter is from about 20um to about 0.1um, and in the parti cularly preferred embodiments is from about 0.1um to about 10um. Amongst these particularly preferred embodiments most preferred are those embodiments in which average particle diameter is from about 0.1um to about 5um. In the polymerization step of the process of this the invention, the substrate having a catalytic surface and in a suitable form, as for example, in the form of a finely divided particulate material or large solid sub strate is contacted with a gas, suspension or solution of the monomer, monomers or other precursors of the desired conjugated backbone polymer, or other polymer which can be converted into a conjugated backbone polymer after polymerization, if necessary in the presence of a co catalyst, such as triethylaluminum, tetramethyl tin, tetraphenyl tin and the like. There after the monomer, monomers or precursors are poly merized, forming the polymer on the surface of the substrate anchored thereto through the bonded catalyst. The polymer coated substrate may be combined with additional conjugated backbone polymers or polymers which can be converted to a conjugated backbone polymer by blending the polymer coated substrate with the pre formed polymer or by the further polymerization of monomers of the additional polymer by unmodified cata lyst in the presence of the polymer coated substrate. This combination yields a desired ratio of substrate to polymer, and is useful is the fabrication of articles having a continuous conjugated backbone polymer phase containing dispersed substrate. In the preferred embodiments of this invention, the polymerization of monomers or precursors is performed in a mixture of substrates having a catalytic surface and unmodified polymerization catalyst. This combination of steps b and c yields a composite with good adhesion between substrate and the additional polymer via the polymer coating, as well as the desired weight ratio of sub strate to polymer. The types of monomers or precursors employed will vary widely depending on the desired conjugated backbone polymer. Useful monomers are those which are precursors in the production of conjugated backbone polymers known to those of skill in the art or monomers which form other types of polymers which can be converted into the desired conjugated backbone polymer. Illustrative of monomers used in the formation of polymers which are convertible into conjugated backbone polymers is 7,8 bis trifluorometyl tricyclo 4,2,20 deca 3,7,9 triene whose metathesis polymerization product can be converted to polyacetylene, and monomers which can be polymerized to form poly 5,6 diacetoxycyclohex 2 ene 1,4 diyl which can be converted to poly paraphenylene . Mixtures of monomers can be used. For example, various combinations of monomers can be employed to form conjugated backbone copolymers, or blends of one or more conjugated backbone homopolymers or copolymers with one or more conjugated backbone or non conjugated backbone homopolymers or copolymers. As is apparent from the foregoing, monomers useful in the practice of the method of this invention can vary widely and may include monomers which can be polymerized into unsubstitued and substituted polyace tylene, poly paraphenylene , poly phenylquinoline , poly phenylene vinylene and the like. Other useful monomers include those which can be polymerized into conjugated backbone polymers claimed by others as useful in batteries such as monomers which form polythiophene, polyazulene, poly phenylquinoline , polypyrrole, poly acenes, polyaniline, polyacenediyls, polynaphthalene, substituted derivatives, polymeric blends thereof and the like. Preferred for use in the practice of this invention are monomers which can be directly polymerized to form conjugated backbone polymers useful as battery elect rodes, or to form other polymers which can be converted into these conjugated backbone polmers. Conjuated backbone polymers useful as positive electrodes are conductive in their oxidized or reduced form, and are capable of reversibly inserting anions or cations. Amongst these illustrative conjugated backbone polymers, polyacetylene, poly phenylene vinylene and poly p phenylene are preferred for use in negative electrodes, and polyacetylene and poly p phenylene are particularly preferred for such use. Accordingly, monomers and other precursors which result in the formation of these poly mers are preferred and particularly preferred for use in the practice of this invention, respectively. Most preferred for use in the practice of this invention is polyacetylene and accordingly, acetylene is the most preferred monomer. In the second step of the method of this invention, the monomer or monomers are polymerized in the presence of the dispersed material. Polymerization reaction conditions for the polymers and precusor polymers described above as well known in the art. For example, useful conditions are described in detail in H. Shirakawa, et al., The composite of polymer and substrate can be recovered from the polymerization mixture using standard procedures. Composites of soluble polymers nucleated about substrates can be filtered to recover the insol ble derivatized fraction. Composites which are powders, gels, or films of insoluble polymers nucleated about derivatized substrates can be extracted with a solvent which is unreactive with the polymer and the sub strate. For example, in those embodiments of this invention in which the product is a continuous film of polymer having finely divided electroactive material therein or coated onto a grid of some material, such as nickel, steel, stainless steel, graphite, and the like, the film composite, is removed from the polymerization mixture, extracted with an inert solvent, and thereafter used in battery construction as an electrode in accord ance with conventional procedures. Illustrative of such procedures are those described in Kaner and MacDiarmid, As an essential component, the other anode for use in the practice of this invention is an alloy of sodium. The type of sodium alloy employed is not critical and can vary widely. Such alloys can be binary, ternary or can contain more than three components. The other component or components can be metallic or non metal lic. Illustrative of alloys which are useful in the conduct of this invention are binary sodium alloys such as sodium alloys of tin, lead, silicon, antimony, bismuth, tellurium, thallium, selenium, gold, cadmium, arsenic, mercury, cesium, gallium, and the like. Also illustrative of useful alloys are ternary sodium alloys such as sodium alloys of tin and lead, antimony and lead, selenium and tellurium, and the like. Useful alloys include quaternary alloys such as solium alloys of lead, tin and bismuth. Preferred for use in the practice of this embodi ment of the invention are sodium alloys in which the other component or components are metals. Particularly preferred for use in the practice of this invention are alloys of sodium and one or more metals selected from the group consisting of tin, lead, antimony, bismuth, selenium, tellerium, mercury and cadmium. Amongst these particularly preferred embodiments, most preferred are ternary or binary alloys of sodium, and tin, lead, bismuth and or antimony. The mole ratios of the components of the alloy can vary widely, depending on permissible ratios based on allowed interactions between the components and the desired capacity of the anode. In general, since sodium is the electroactive material in the anode, the greater the mole percent of sodium in the anode, the greater the capacity of the anode and conversely, the lower the mole ratio of sodium in the anode, the lower the capa city. In general, since higher capacities are desira ble, higher amounts of sodium in the alloy are desira ble. Sodium as compared to lithium is readily adaptable to providing such high capacity anodes because it can form intermetallic compounds or alloys such as Na₅Pb₂, Na₁₅Pb₄, Na₅Sn₂, and Na₁₅Sn₄, which have higher sodium content. In the preferred embodiments of the invention, the mole ratio of sodium to other components in the alloy is about equal to or greater than about 0.5 to 1. In these preferred embodiments, the upper amount of sodium in the alloy is the greatest amount of sodium which can be alloyed with the other component or com ponents before pure metallic, un alloyed sodium is formed. In the particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, the mole ratio of sodium to the other components in the alloy will usually vary from about 1 to about 1, to about 5 to about 1, and in the most pre ferred embodiments will vary from about 4 to about 1, to about 1 to about 1. The method of manufacturing the sodium alloy is not critical and can vary widely. Conventional alloying procedures are readily adaptable for use in the practice of this invention. For example, such alloys can be formed electrochemically by plating sodium onto a sub strate of the other components as described in more detail in N.N. Tomashova, I.G. Kieseleva and B.N. Kabanov, The anode of this aspect of the invention may also include other optional materials. For example, in the preferred embodiments of invention, the anode includes one or more polymeric binders. In these preferred embodiments of the invention, the alloy is generally in particulate form, bonded together, and maintained in a composite structure by the binder. The use of the polymeric binders with the alloy in particulate form, provides for a large surface area for the sodium alloy to contact with the electrolyte media when the anode is placed in the battery electrolyte solution. Polymeric binders which are useful in the practice of this inven tion are those which form porous substrates to allow for contact between the particulate alloy and the electro lyte, and which hold the alloy in the composite during the charging and discharging of the cell. These func tions can be provided by a single binder or a mixture of binders can be used of which possess one or more of the desirable characteristics. Illustrative of such binders are polyphenylene, and other conjugated backbone polymers such as polythiophene, polyacetylene and the like, and nonconjugated backbone polymers, as for example polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, polyvinyls polyethylene and polypropylene. An especially useful polymer binder is polyphenylene because it swells and also becomes conductive when doped with sodium cations, in combination with polyethylene or polypropylene. However, other materials can be used as binders, pro vided they are porous to allow for contact between the electrolyte and the alloy and allow the alloy maintains a good electrical continuity within the anode structure, and they maintain the alloy in the composite during the charging and discharging of the cell. When swellable and dopable polymers such as polyphenylene PPP are used, alloys having higher sodium content are employed due to the fact that such polymers will absorb sodium from the alloy. Higher sodium content may not be needed when the swellable polymer does not take sodium from the alloy. The amount of binder used in the preferred embodi ments of the invention is not critical and can vary widely. Usually the amount of binder is not greater than about 40 weight percent based on the total weight percent based on the total weight of alloy and binder, and preferably from about 10 to about 30 weight percent on the aforementioned basis. The organic solvents which may be included in the electrolyte of the batteries of the present invention may vary widely and can be organic solvents normally used in batteries. Preferably, these solvents should be electrochemically inert to oxidation and reduction during use while simultaneously being capable of dis solving the desired alkali metal salt and providing ionic conductivity equal to or in excess of 10 ⁴ S cm. Examples of such useful organic solvents include propy lene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, sulfolane, methyl sulfolane, dimethyl sulfolane, 3 methyl 2 oxazolidone, alkane sultones, e.g., propane sultone, butane sultone the use of sultones as electrolyte compositions is the subject of a related, commonly assigned U.S. patent application Serial No. 556,717, and the use of sultones for coatings on polymer anodes is the subject of a related, commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,472,489 , dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO , dimethyl sulfite, tetrahydro furan THF , 2 methyltetrahydrofuran 2 MTHF , dioxane, dioxolane, 1,2 dimethoxyethane DME , diemthoxymethane, diglymes, glymes, anisole, nitriles, e.g., proprioni trile, butyronitrile, acetonitrile, benzonitrile , dichloromethane, tetraethylsulfamide, aromatic hydro carbons, e.g., toluene, benzene, organo phosphorus compounds, e.g., hexamethylene phosphoramide, and tri methyl phosphate. Mixtures of such available organic solvents may also be used, such as mixtures of sulfolane and acetonitrile, or mixtures of propylene carbonate and dimethoxyethane. The organic solvents chosen for use in any particu lar situation will, of course, depend upon many factors such as the precise electrolyte composition used and the voltage range desired, as well as the choice of cathode and other components of the battery used. A particu larly important consideration in choosing a solvent is whether the conjugated backbone polymer employed is subject to attack by the solvent. In the preferred embodiments of the invention when uncoated anodes are employed, ether type solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, diglyme, 2 methyltetrahydrofuran and mixtures thereof are employed because these solvents are generally not reactive with conjugated backbone poly mers, when in their neutral or reduced forms. Essen tially, any of the above listed solvents can be used with anodes coated with solvent resistant coatings however, preferred for use with coated anodes are propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, sulfolane, 3 methylsulfolane and mixtures of any of the above listed solvents, which mixtures may also include glymes, par ticularly dimethoxyethane. Salts for use in the electrolyte of the battery of this invention are of the formula MA wherein M is an alkali metal and A is a species which is anionic in the electrolyte and stable under operational conditions. Preferred alkali metals are lithium, sodium and potassium, and the particularly preferred alkali metals are lithium and sodium. Suitable anionic species include I , Br , Cl , C10₄ , PF₆ , AsF₆ , SO₃CF₃ , BF₄ , BCl₄ , AlCl₄ , alkylborates, such as B CH₃ ₄ , arylborates, such as B C₆H₅ ₄ , the use of such borate salts with conjugated polymers being the subject of commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 556,721, incorporated herein by reference , POF₄ , CN , SCN , OCN , CF₃CO₂ trifluoroacetate , C₆H₅CO₂ benzoate , CH₃C₆H₄SO₃ tosylate , SiF₆ Molten salts may also be employed as the electro lyte of the battery of the invention. The use of conju gated polymers as anodes in room temperature molten salt batteries is described in the commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,463,071, which is incorporated herein by reference. Room temperature molten salts suitable for use in batteries of this invention include alkali metal halide trialkylimidazolium chloroaluminate, alkali metal halide dialkylimidazolium chloroaluminate, and alkali metal halide alkyl pyridinium chloroaluminate. Since in many cases the polymers, alloys, and other ion inserting materials of this invention are stable at elevated tem perature, intermediate temperature molten salts M.P. 200 C such as NaAlCl₄ or KAlCl₄, are also suitable for use. Cathodes for use in the practice of this invention are not critical and can be varied widely. Suitable cathodes include a material selected from the group consisting of graphite, intercalation compounds of graphite, high surface area carbons 200 m² g , transition metal chalcogenides, and conjugated backbone polymers which are capable of being oxidized acceptor doped . Transition metal chalcogenides and conjugated backbone polymers are preferred cathode materials. The transition metal chalcogenides, suitable as cathode materials useful in this invention, can contain inserted alkali metals and include the transition metal dichalcogenides such as TiS₂ and, among others, those listed on page 392 of Lithium Batteries edited by J.P. Gabano Academic Press, 1983 and in K.M. Abraham, Solid State Ionics, vol. 7, pp. 199 212 1982 both incor porated herein by reference .

Such polymers may be coated by reaction, when oxidized, with pyrroles, thiophenes, azulenes, oxiranes, anilines or furans, as described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,472,987, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The secondary battery of this invention can be charged and discharged in accordance with the procedure described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,321,114. Such procedures are well known to those of skill in the art and will not be described herein in any great detail. The following specific examples are presented to more particularly illustrate the invention and are not to be construed as limitations therein. Polyacetylene PA powder prepared from a catalyst of triethyl aluminum and tetrabutoxy titanium which was kept wet in toluene in a refrigerator at 40 C in an argon filled dry box before use was mixed with aluminum Al powder 40 325 mesh using a mortar and pestle. The mixture was then pressed onto expanded Ni metal in a 1 2 inch 1.27 cm diameter stainless steel die under pressures in the range of 5,000 to 75,000 psi 34,470 to 517,050 kPa . The weights of Al and PA were .065g and .015g, respectively. This electrode was dried under vacuum before being assembled into a test cell with a lithium counter electrode, a Celgard PA on an Al electrode was prepared by polymerizing PA by the Shirakawa technique Polymer Journal, Vol. 2 No. 2, pp 231 244 1971 on expanded Al metal wt. 10 mg, diameter 1.0 cm with a nickel tab welded on as a lead. The PA on Al electrode was assembled into a cell with lithium in LiBBu₄ Bu Butyl in THF solution and discharge at a rate of 0.5 mA cm². The capacity obtained when the voltage reached 0.25V was 9.46 mAh. The capacity of the flat part 0.3 to 0.25V of the cell voltage vs. time was 8.54 mAh. Assuming the flat part was completely due to Al, the utilization of Al is 86 i.e., a final composition of Li A mixture of 0.4g poly p phenylene PPP powder prepared by the method of Kovacic , J. Am. Chem. Soc. In a three neck round bottom flask, 0.356g of aluminum powder and 6.0g of molybdenum VI tetra chloride oxide were combined under argon. Using a syringe, 10g of benzene were added and the mixture was stirred under argon for 120 hours at room temperature. The resulting poly p phenylene Al composite was washed repeatedly with benzene, acetonitrile, water, and acetone and dried under vacuum. Infrared spectra showed absorption bands characteristic of poly p phenylene . An electrode was fashioned by pressing a mixture of 77 poly p phenylene Al composite, 13 carbon black, and 10 binder onto a nickel grid at 1000hg cm² in a rectangular press. The electrode was then removed and heat set at 160 C. After low molecular weight oligomers were extracted, this electrode was incorporated into a half cell consisting of a lithium reference and counter electrode and 0.5M LiBBu₄ in THF as the electrolyte. The cell was cycled between 1.1V and 0.1V with respect to the lithium reference. The capacity was 575C per gram of composite of which 345C were due to Li insertion into the aluminum and 230C were due to Li insertion into the poly p phenylene . The average coulombic efficiency over twelve cycles was 98 and there was no loss in capacity with cycling. To prepare Na Pb alloy metallurgically, proper amounts of Na and Pb were placed in a stainless steel container and heated at a temperature about 510 10 C in inert atmosphere or under vacuum for a few hours and then quenched to room temperatures. the alloy was then pulverized before used. Na Pb alloy of the following composition NaPb₃, Na₅Pb₂ and Na₁₅Pb₄ were prepared using the method described as above. Their electro chemical potentials relative to Na were measured using electrometer in the appropriate electrolyte solutions containing sodium ions and listed in Table 1 as follows Metallurgically formed Na Pb alloy powder of the composition Na₁₅Pb₄ 32 mg was pressed onto the expanded nickel metal and used as an electrode. The potential of this electrode was measured while stripping 83 of the Na in the Na₁₅Pb₄ alloy away from the electrode. The potential vs the amount of sodium stripped from the electrode was plotted. Several potential plateaus were observed from the plot. This indicated that Na₁₅Pb₄ and other binary alloys formed during the stripping procedure corresponded well with the potentials measure in Example 1 and with their respective compositions. Less than 100 Na stripping from the alloy was due to the loss alloy resulted from the volume change. Sodium alloy can also be formed elecrochemically by plating Na onto Pb foil. By plating Na on Pb foil at a current density of 50 micramp cm², Na Pb alloy of various compositions were shown as several potential plateaus. The potential of these plateaus 0.5, 0.34, 0.17 and 0.12V corresponded well with the values measured in Example 1. Na ternary alloy containing Pb and Sn was prepared by heating the proper amounts of Na, Pb and Sn in a stainless steel crucible in an inert atmosphere or under vacuum at a temperature about 510 10 C for few hours and then quenching to room temperatures. The resulting ternary alloy had the following composition NaPb A Na alloy electrode was prepared by mixing the NaPb A cell was constructed which consisted of the anode 68 mg on an area of 0.6 x 2.4 cm² whose preparation is described above and a Na The cell was then cycled at a rate of 0.5 mA cm² in the voltage range of 3.2 to 2.2V Na
