# Flexible thermoplastic bag for use in food package.

## Abstract
A disposable or reusable and reclosable microwave compatible thermoplastic bag 10 capable of being com pactly stored as a food container in freezers, yet capable of standing with an upright spout in a microwave oven for non spill thawing and cooking of food 27 contained in the bag 10 . The bag 10 is formed of two wing shaped pouches 12, 14 on either side of the upright spout, which is smaller than the pouches 12, 14 . A preferred closure of a zipper type is provided in the spout which is adapted to automati cally open to vent vapours from the bag upon softening of its thermoplastic structure during the cooking stage. A second aspect is a package for use as a cold storage and cooking utensil, comprising a thermoplastic bag 10 and a food product 27 therein. The bag 10 is formed of two wing shaped pouches 12, 14 on either side of a spout, the spout forming the only exit for the food product 27 from the bag 10 , whereby spilling of the food product 27 from the bag 10 is avoided during heating.
