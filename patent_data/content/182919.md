## Description
This invention relates to a thermosetting resin composition of the unsaturated bismaleimide compound type, and more specifically to a thermosetting resin composition having excellent handlability and heat resistance and a sufficiently low shrinkage upon curing. Generally, a thermoset product of an unsaturated bismaleimide compound obtained by reacting an amine with maleic anhydride and thermosetting the product has the advantage that it has excellent heat resistance, and since its curing polymerization reaction, an addition reaction, forms no volatile components during curing and a dense cured product can be formed. However, because the unsaturated bismaleimide compounds have low solubility in general organic solvents, to form a solution of this compound requires the use of high boiling solvents such as dimethylformamide and N methylpyrrolidone which are highly polar. To compensate for its low solubility, it is also usual to incorporate an epoxy resin or the like in the unsaturated bismaleimide compound, thereby modifying it. Generally, however, such solutions tend to form precipitates at room temperature, and solventless compositions are too viscous in practical use. This type of thermosetting resin is thus difficult to use in a solventless composition. DE A 3030111 discloses a curable resin composition comprising a a polyfunctional cyanic acid ester, a cyanic acid ester prepolymer or a prepolymer of a cyanic ester and polyamine b an acrylic acid epoxy ester or a prepolymer thereof and c a polyfunctional maleimide, a maleimide prepolymer or a prepolymer of a maleimide and a polyamine. FR A 2201313 discloses a composition comprising a a prepolymer of a bisimide and a polyamine, b an epoxy resin and c an allyl monomer. FR A 2355047 discloses a composition comprising a a polyimide, b an alkenylphenol and or an alkenylphenol ether, c an allyl group containing epoxy compound and or an allyl group free epoxy compound and d an epoxy curing promoting agent. It is an object of this invention to provide a solventless thermosetting resin composition of the unsaturated bismaleimide compound type. Another object of this invention is to provide a thermosetting resin composition having excellent handlability operability and heat resistance. Still another object of this invention is to provide a thermosetting resin composition which can be cured with sufficiently low shrinkage upon curing and is capable of giving a cured product excellent in dimensional stability and appearance. According to this invention, there is provided a thermosetting resin composition consisting of According to one aspect of this invention, there is provided a thermosetting resin composition as described above comprising as an essential ingredient an aliphatic epoxy monomer selected from ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, propylene glycol diglycidyl ether and pentaerythritol polyglycidyl ether, the composition being obtainable by forming the reaction product A by carrying out the reaction in the substantial absence of the vinyl epoxy monomer i , dissolving the reaction product A in the vinyl epoxy monomer i as solvent and adding the aliphatic epoxy monomer the epoxy curing agent and the radical polymerisation initiator to the resultant solution. There are two preferred embodiments of the thermosetting resin composition of this invention, which will be described below in detail. In this embodiment, the following ingredients are used. The ingredient a is the reaction product A of a polyamino compound and an unsaturated bismaleimide compound. Examples of the polyamino compound are those of the following general formula I but are by no means limited to those wherein R₁ represents an organic group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and x is 0.1 to 2. Examples of the unsaturated bismaleimide compounds used together with the above polyamino compounds are those of the following general formula wherein R₂ represents an alkylene, cycloalkylene or arylene group having at least 2 carbon atoms or an organic group composed of a combination of two or more of these groups, and R₃ represents a divalent organic group having a carbon carbon double bond. Concretely, the following compounds, for example, may be used. N,N phenylenebismaleimide, N,N hexamethylene bismaleimide, N,N methylene di p phenylene bismaleimide, N,N 4,4 benzophenone bismaleimide, N,N p diphenylsulfone bismaleimide, N,N 3,3 dimethyl methylene p phenylene bismaleimide, N,N 4,4 dicyclohexylmethane bismaleimide, N,N p xylylene bismaleimide, N,N 3,3 diethyl methylene di p phenylene bismaleimide, N,N m tolylene bismaleimide or aniline formaline reaction product. These unsaturated bismaleimide compounds may be replaced by monomaleimide compounds such as N allylmaleimide, N propylmaleimide, N hexylmaleimide or N phenylmaleimide up to about 60 by weight. Generally, 1 gram equivalent of the polyamino compound is pre reacted with above 0.1 to 10 gram equivalents, preferably about 0.5 to 5 gram equivalents, of the unsaturated bismaleimide compound. The pre reaction product may be formed by, for example, mixing them in the absence of the liquid component B at a temperature of about 70 to 170 C for a period of 2 to 15 minutes by using a roll or the like to form a prepolymer. The softening point of the prepolymer is usually adjusted to 60 to 110 C. The softening point is measured by observing the sample under a microscope while it is heated at a rate of 2 C min. As a result of this treatment, the amino groups of the polyamino compound add to the unsaturated bond of the bismaleimide compound by the Michael addition reaction whereby a polyaminobismaleimide may be formed. The ingredient a has the advantage that since the curing polymerization reaction is an addition reaction it forms no volatile component during curing and a dense cured product. In addition, it can dissolve uniformly in the liquid component B even at room temperature. This acts as a diluent for the ingredient a and dissolves it even at room temperature. Accordingly, without using a particular solvent, the curable resin composition is formed as a solution of a low viscosity and exerts an improved workability. The liquid component B may contain a styrene type monomer such as styrene, alpha methylstyrene, vinyltoluene or divinylbenxene in amounts which do not substantially impair its solubilizing power at room temperature on the prepolymer. The upper limit of the amount of the styrene monomer is set usually at 0.1 to 10 moles, preferably 0.1 to 3 moles, per mole of the vinyl epoxy monomer i . The use of the styrene monomer in the aforesaid ratios is desirable to dissolve ingredient a to prepare a low viscosity solution and further increases the strength of the cured product. The epoxy curing agent may be any of those known curing agents which do not substantially affect radical polymerization selected from aliphatic amines, acid anhydrides, dicyandiamide, hydrazines, imidazoles and amine complexes of boron trifluoride. Examples of the radical polymerization initiators are as follows The thermosetting composition I of this invention consists essentially of the reaction product A , liquid component B and curing system C described above. As required, it is possible also to incorporate epoxy curing accelerators such as imidazoles, amine complexes of boron trifluoride, tertiary amines, quaternary ammonium salts or urea compounds, and internal mould releasing agents such as higher fatty acid metal salts in amounts known The resin composition of embodiment I generally comprises The ingredient a is prepared as a solution in the liquid component B . The preliminary reaction of the ingredient a is carried out in the substantial absence of the liquid component B at a temperature of about 70 to 170 C in a reactor to such an extent that the ingredient a dissolves in the liquid component B even at room temperature and does not precipitate even when the solution is left to stand at room temperature. The epoxy curing agent and, as required, additives such as an epoxy curing accelerator, are added at room temperature to the resulting uniform solution of ingredient a in the liquid component B , and further the radical polymerisation initiator and, as required, additives such as an internal mould releasing agent or the like are added to give the thermosetting resin composition of embodiment I . The thermosetting resin composition of embodiment II contains an aliphatic epoxy monomer selected from ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, propylene glycol diglycidyl ether and pentaerythritol polyglycidyl ether, as an essential ingredient in addition to the vinyl epoxy monomer i and the other essential ingredients of the resin composition of embodiment I . Because of the incorporation of the aliphatic epoxy monomer, the thermosetting resin composition of embodiment II has a markedly reduced shrinkage upon curing over the resin composition of embodiment I . This brings about the advantage that the dimensional stability and appearance stability of the cured product are not impaired. The shrinkage of the composition upon curing can be markedly reduced as will be shown by an Example given hereinafter. The thermosetting resin composition of embodiment II , generally comprises In the preparation of this resin composition, component a and the vinyl epoxy monomer i are used in the form of a mixture as in embodiment I . The thermosetting resin composition of embodiment II can be prepared by adding the aliphatic epoxy monomer, the epoxy curing agent and, as required, an epoxy curing accelerator to the mixture, and further adding the radical polymerization initiator and, as required, an internal mould releasing agent. The resulting thermosetting resin compositions I and II of this invention have the following characteristics and advantages. N,N 4,4 diphenylmethane bismaleimide 82 parts and 18 parts of 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethane were preliminarily reacted at 130 C for 15 minutes by a roll to obtain 100 parts of a prepolymer. Sixty parts of the prepolymer and 40 parts of glycidyl methacrylate were mixed in a glass reactor at room temperature for 30 minutes to dissolve the prepolymer. Then, 2 parts of dicyandiamide as an epoxy curing agent, 0.5 part of 2 ethyl 4 methylimidazole as an epoxy curing accelerator, 1 part of dicumyl peroxide as a radical polymerization initiator and 2 parts of zinc stearate as an internal mold releasing agent were mixed to prepare a thermosetting resin composition. The thermosetting resin composition was impregnated at room temperature into eight layers of chopped glass fiber mat chop length 50 mm, basis weight 300 g m² . The impregnated mats were pressed at room temperature to prepare an SMC thickness about 3 mm having a glass fiber content of about 60 . A polyethylene film having a thickness of 50 micrometers as a mold releasing film was used as an overcoat. The SMC was left to stand at room temperature for several days to render it tack free, and then cured at 160 C for 3 minutes. It was further cured in an air oven at 200 C for 24 hours to obtain a plate like compression molded article. The various properties described below of the SMC and the article were measured. The results are shown in Table 1. Measured at 25 C by a E type viscometer Impregnability of the resin composition in the chopped Example 1 was repeated except that the amounts of the prepolymer and glycidyl methacrylate were changed to 70 and 30 parts, respectively. Example 1 was repeated except that the amounts of the prepolymer and glycidyl methacrylate were changed both to 50 parts.

The thermosetting resin composition obtained in Example 1 was impregnated into a carbon fiber layer thickness 0.4 mm, basis weight 400 g m² in which the fibers were unidirectionally aligned, at room temperature between rolls to prepare a prepreg having a carbon fiber content of about 65 by weight. Five plies of such prepreg were heated in an autoclave under a pressure of 3 kgf cm² to 150 C at a rate of 2 C min., and thereafter cured at 150 C for 30 minutes to obtain a plate like compression molded article. The properties of the prepreg and the molded article were evaluated as in Example 1, and the results are shown in Table 2. N,N 4,4 diphenylmethane bismaleimide 82 parts and 18 parts of 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethane were prereacted by heating them at 130 C for 15 minutes by a roll to obtain 100 parts of a prepolymer. Fifty five parts of the prepolymer and 35 parts of glycidyl methacrylate were mixed in a glass reactor at room temperature for 30 minutes to dissolve the prepolymer.
