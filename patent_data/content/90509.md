# Cassette roller guide.

## Abstract
An improved magnetic tape roller guide assembly 28 rotatably mounted between spaced sidewalls 12, 14 of a magnetic tape cassette 10 . The roller guide 28 includes a central hub 36 having an integral biasing projection 46 formed on an end surface 48 by partially slicing the mate rial comprising the hub 36 . The projection 46 bears against one sidewall 12, 14 to produce a biasing force locating the guide assembly 28 between the sidewalls 12, 14 , thus preventing guide 28 oscillation.
