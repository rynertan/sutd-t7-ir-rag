# Gamma globulin preparation for intravenous administration.

## Abstract
A dry γ globulin preparation capable of intravenous injec tion is obtained by fractionating human plasma with polyethylene glycol, purifying the γ globulin fraction with respect to protein to render the residual polyethylene glycol substantially not detectable in a 5 W V aqueous γ globulin solution, adding to the solution 0.2 to 2 parts by weight of glucose based on 1 part of γ globulin, and lyophilizing the solution. This method provides a y globulin preparation having improved water solubility and stability against increase of anticomplement activity and decrease of antibody titer.
