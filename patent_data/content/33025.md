# Printing apparatus.

## Abstract
A printing apparatus is provided which is particularly suitable for printing bar code indicia on record media 16 such as bank cheques or similar documents. The bar code indicia consist of a series of symbols which may be 01 or 10 , in which 1 is represented by the presence of a bar and 0 is represented by the absence of a bar in a possible bar position on the record media 16 . The printing apparatus includes a type member 10 having two angled indicia carrying surfaces 28, 30 on one end and being rockable between two positions A and B in each of which one of the printing surfaces 28, 30 is parallel to the path of movement of the record media 16 , and the other of said surfaces is at an angle thereto. A hammer 34 driven by a constant speed cam 40 coacts with the printing surfaces 28, 30 on the platen 40 to print on the record media 16 during each cycle of cam rotation.
