# Thermally induced hydrolysis of acetal.

## Abstract
A process for the selective, thermally induced hydrolysis of acetals to the corresponding aldehydes and alcohols is disclosed, involving heating and pressurizing a substantially acid free acetal containing solution to effect the rapid hydrolysis of the acetals without significant harm to the remaining reaction system components, and removing the treated solution from the reaction zone as product.
