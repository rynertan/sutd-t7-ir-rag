## Description
ETHANOLAMINE DERIVATIVES PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM, AND PROCESSES FOR PREPARING THEM. The present invention relates to derivatives of ethanolamlne which have anti obesity and or anti hyperglycaemic activity, to processes for their production and to their use in medicine. This activity is coupled with low cardiac stimulant activity for particular compounds of the invention. According to the present invention there is provided a compound of formula I EMI2.1 or a salt thereof, wherein R is hydrogen or C16 alkyl, R1 is hydrogen, or fluorine, R2 is hydrogen, halogen or trifluoromethyl, R3 is hydrogen or methyl, R4 is hydrogen, C16 alkyl, optionally substituted benzyl, or optionally substituted phenyl, X is C2 10 straight or branched alkylene having at least two carbon atoms interposed between the oxygen and nitrogen atoms and n is 1 or 2 Preferably, R is hydrogen or methyl. Suitably R1 is hydrogen. Preferably R2 is a meta substituent and is hydrogen, trifluoromethyl or chlorine. X is preferably ethylene, and R3 is preferably methyl. Suitable substituents for the phenyl and benzyl groups, R4, include halogen, hydroxyl, C14 alkyl, C14 alkoxyl, amino, mono and di C14alkyl amino, nitro, cyano, carboxyl and trifluoromethyl substituents. The salts of compounds of formula I are preferably, but not essentially, pharmaceutically acceptable as they are also useful in the preparation of other compounds of formula I and in the separation of stereoisomers of compounds of formula I when the counter ion is also optically active. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I include acid addition salts formed with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, orthophosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, methane sulphonic acid, toluenesulphonic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, salicylic acid or acetylsalicylic acid. When R3 is a methyl group the compounds of formula 1 have two asymmetric carbon atoms, ie the carbon atom bearing the phenyl and OR groups and the carbon atom bearing R3. Such compounds may, therefore, exist in four stereoisomeric forms. The present invention encompasses all stereoisomers of the compounds of formula I whether free or admixed with other stereoisomers in any proportion and thus includes, for instance, racemic mixtures of enantiomers. Preferably the carbon atom bearing the phenyl and OR groups has the R absolute configuration. Most preferably, both the carbon atom bearing the phenyl and OR groups and that bearing R3, when R3 is a methyl group, have the R absolute configuration, since such compounds are generally the most potent. The absolute configuration of any compound of formula I may be determined by conventional X ray crystallographic techniques. The present invention also provides a process for producing a compound of formula I , or a salt thereof, which process comprises reducing a keto group and or double bond and or cleaving a benzyl group s of a compound of formula II EMI4.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, and n are as defined in relation to formula I R5 is a group R4 as defined in relation to formula I or a group reducible to the group R4 R10 is hydrogen or together with R11 forms a bond Rll is hydrogen or benzyl or together with R10 or R12 forms a bond R12 is hydrogen or together with R11 forms a bond or together with R13 forms an oxo group R13 is hydrogen or together with R12 forms an oxo group R14 is hydrogen or together with R15 forms an oxo group R15 is hydroxyl or.C1,6 alkoxy, or together with R14 forms an oxo group Y is a group X as defined in relation to formula I or a group reducible to a group X, provided that there is no more than one oxo group represented by any of R12 to R15 and optionally thereafter forming a salt of the compound of formula I so formed, and or converting the compound of formula I so formed into a further compound of formula I . Where there are two or more reducible functional groups in the compound of formula II these may be reduced separately in any order or simultaneously. The aforementioned reductions may be effected by conventional chemical methods or by catalytic methods.Suitably, chemical reduction may be effected with lithium aluminium hydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium borohydride or borane methyl sulphide.Catalytic hydrogenation may be carried out using catalysts such as palladium on charcoal, or platinum, for instance, as reduced platinum oxide. Reduction by sodium borohydride is conveniently effected in a lower alkanolic solvent such as methanol or ethanol. The reaction is generally carried out at from 0 20 C. Reduction by lithium aluminium hydride is conveniently effected in a dry, ether solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran at ambient or elevated temperatures. Catalytic reduction is conveniently effected in a conventional hydrogenation solvent such as a lower alkanol, for instance ethanol. The hydrogenation is generally carried out under hydrogen gas at about 1 to 10 atmospheres pressure and at ambient or elevated temperatures. Reduction of a compound of formula II wherein R5 or R11 is benzyl is conveniently effected by catalytic hydrogenation, preferably using palladium on charcoal as catalyst. Preferred aspects of the process of the invention comprise reducing a compound of formula IIA EMI6.1 or reducing a compound of formula IIB EMI6.2 or reducing a compound of formula IIC EMI6.3 or reducing a compound of formula I ID EMI7.1 or reducing a compound of formula IIE EMI7.2 or reducing a compound of formula IIF EMI7.3 or reducing a compound of formula IIG EMI8.1 wherein R, R1, R2, R3, R4, X and n are as defined in relation to formula I , and R5, R14, R15 and Y are as defined in relation to formula II . The present invention also provides another process for producing a compound of formula I or a salt thereof, which process comprises reacting a compound of formula III EMI8.2 wherein R3, R4, X and n are as defined in relation to formula I with a compound of formula IV EMI8.3 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined in relation to formula I , and yl is a group capable of reacting with the primary amino group of a compound of formula III , thus forming a compound of formula I directly, and optionally thereafter forming a salt of the compound of formula I so formed and or converting the compound of formula I so formed into a further compound of formula I . Typical examples of compounds of formula IV are compounds of formulae IVA and IVB EMI9.1 wherein R, R1 and R2 are as defined in relation to formula I and zl is a leaving group, preferably halogen or a tosyloxy group. The reaction of a compound of formula III with a compound of formula IVA is conveniently effected in a solvent such as a lower alkanol, preferably ethanol. The reaction of a compound of formula III with a compound of formula IVB is conveniently conducted in a solvent, such as dimethyl sulphoxide, at elevated temperature, preferably about 500C, The present invention provides a further process for the production of compounds of formula I or salts thereof, which process comprises reacting a compound of formula V EMI10.1 wherein R, R1 and R2 are as defined in relation to formula I with a compound of formula VI EMI10.2 wherein R3, R4, X and n are as defined in relation to formula I and z2 is a leaving group preferably halogen or tosyloxy. The reaction of a compound of formula V with a compound of formula VI is conveniently effected in a solvent such as dimethylsulphoxide at an elevated temperature, preferably about 500C for about two or three days. A preferred process for producing compounds of formula I comprises the reduction of a compound of formula IIA , especially using sodium borohydride in methanol at ambient temperatures. The salts of compounds of formula I may be produced by treating the compound of formula I with the appropriate acid. Compounds of formula I and salts thereof, produced by the above processes, may be recovered from the reaction medium and purified by conventional methods. Compounds of formula II may be produced by reacting a compound of formula III as hereinbefore defined with a compound of formula VII EMI11.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined in relation to formula I and y2 is a group which is capable of reacting with the amine of formula III thus forming a compound of formula II . Typical examples of compounds of formula VII are EMI12.1 or its hydrate or hemi acetal of a lower alkanol EMI12.2 wherein Z3 is a leaving group, preferably bromine EMI13.1 wherein R, R1 and R2 are as defined in relation to formula I . Conventional conditions compatible with the particular compound of formula VII may be used for this reaction. Thus, the reaction of a compound of formula VIIA with a compound of formula III is conveniently conducted at elevated temperatures under conditions resulting in the removal of the water formed during the reaction. A particularly suitable method is to perform the reaction in a solvent, such as benzene, under reflux and to remove the water azeotropically using a Dean and Stark trap. The reaction of a compound of formula VIIB with a compound of formula III is conveniently conducted in a polar organic solvent such as acetonitrile or butanone, at an elevated temperature, for instance under reflux. The reaction of a compound of formula VIIC with a compound of formula III is conveniently conducted under standard peptide formation reaction conditions. Alternatively a compound of formula II may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula VIII EMI14.1 wherein R1, R2, R14 and R15 are as defined in relation to formula II and Z4 is a leaving group, preferably halogen or tosyloxy with a compound of formula IX EMI14.2 wherein R3, and n are as defined in relation to formula 1 , and Y and R5 are as defined in relation to formula 11 . A particularly preferred process for producing certain compounds of formula II comprises reacting a compound of formula V as hereinbefore defined with a compound of the formula X EMI14.3 wherein R3 and n are as defined in relation to formula I , and Y and R5 are as defined in relation to formula 11 . The reaction of a compound of formula V with a compound of formula X is conveniently effected under conditions which result in the removal of water formed during the reaction. A particularly suitable method is to perform the reaction in a solvent, such as benzene, under reflux and to remove the water azeotropically using a Dean and Stark trap. It is often convenient to prepare the compound of formula II and reduce it, in situ, to the desired compound of formula I without isolation of the compound of formula it . Those compounds of formula I having more than one asymmetric carbon atom may be separated into diastereoisomeric pairs of enantiomers by, for example, fractional crystallisation from a suitable solvent such as ethyl acetate. The pair of enantiomers thus obtained may be separated into individual stereoisomers by conventional means such as by the use of an optically active acid as a resolving agent. Suitable optically active acids which may be used as resolving agents are described in Topics inStereochemistry , Vol. 6, Wiley Interscience, 1971,Allinger, N.L., and Eliel, W.L. Eds. Alternatively any enantiomer of a compound of formula I may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials of known configuration. By reacting a single enantiomer of a compound of formula III with a single enantiomer of a compound of formula IVA or IVB , the direct stereospecific synthesis of a single enantiomer of a compound of formula I is effected. Thus, for example, reaction of a compound of formula IVA with the R absolute configuration with a single enantiomer of a compound of formula III in which the carbon atom bearing R3, whenR3 is a methyl group, has the R absolute configuration would afford a compound of formula I with the R,Rabsolute configuration. By using single enantiomers of a compound of formula III and of a compound of formula VIIC a stereospecific synthesis of a compound of formula tri is achieved. This may then be reduced to a compound of formula I without altering the configuration of the asymmetric carbon atoms. Thus, for example, reaction of a compound of formula VIIC with the R absolute configuration and a single enantiomer of a compound of formula III , in which the carbon atom bearing R3, when R3 is a methyl groupr has theR absolute configuration, would afford a compound of formula II and, on reduction, a single enantiomer of the compound of formula I with the R,R absolute configuration. A compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof hereinafter the drug may be administered as the pure drug, however, it is preferred that the drug be administered as a pharmaceutical composition also comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier there for. As used herein the terms pharmaceutical composition and pharmaceutically acceptable embrace compositions and ingredients for both human and veterinary use. Usually the compositions of the present invention will be adapted for oral administration although compositions for administration by other routes, such as by injection are also envisaged. Particularly suitable compositions for oral administration are unit dosage forms such as tablets and capsules. Other fixed unit dosage forms, such as powders presented in sachets, may also be used. In accordance with conventional pharmaceutical practice the carrier may comprise a diluent, filler, disintegrant, wetting agent, lubricant, colourant, flavourant, or the like. Typical carriers may, therefore, comprise such agents as microcrystalline cellulose, starch, sodium starch glycollate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvlnyl polypyrrolidone, magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulphate, sucrose, and the like. Most suitably the composition will be provided in unit dose form. Such unit doses will normally comprise 0.1 to 500 mg of the drug, more usually 0.1 to 250 mg and favourably 0.1 to 100 mg. The present invention further provides a method for treating obesity in human or non human animals, which method comprises administering an effective, non toxic amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to obese humans or non human animals. The present invention further provides a method for treating hyperglycaemia in humans or non human animals which method comprises administering an effective, non toxic amount of a compound of formula 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to hyperglycaemic humans or non human animals. Conveniently, the drug may be administered as a pharmaceutical composition as hereinbefore defined, and this forms a particular aspect of the present invention. In treating hyperglycaemic or obese humans the drug may be taken in doses, such as those described above, one to six times a day in a manner such that the total daily dose for a 70 kg adult will generally be about 0.1 to 1000 mg, and more usually about 1 to 500 mg. In treating hyperglycaemic or obese animals, especially dogs, the drug may be administered by mouth, usually once or twice a day and at about 0.025 mg kg to 10 mg kg, for example 0.1 mg kg to 2 mg kg. The invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following Examples. As used in the Examples, the term diastereoisomer refers to a pair of enantiomers.

The compounds were dissolved in water.When necessary the acid addition salt was prepared by addition of hydrochloric acid to the water. These solutions were administered orally to each of 12 mice.A further 12 mice were dosed orally with water. The mice were placed in boxes through which air was drawn and the oxygen content of the air leaving the boxes was measured. The energy expenditure of the mice was calculated for 21 hours after dosing from the volume of air leaving the boxes and its oxygen content, following the principles described by J.B. de V. Weir, J.Physiol. London , 109, 1 9 1949 . The food intake of the mice was measured over this same period of 21 hours. The results are expressed as a percentage of the mean food intake or rate of energy expenditure of the mice dosed with water.Compounds of Dose Mean EnergyExample No. mg kg po Expendlture 0 3h 0 21h 1 33 156 114 2 38.5 1A5 127 3 34.7 146 120 4 30.1 141 126 5 28.5 136 112 6 29.4 127 139 continued overleaf 7 31.1 121 136 8 33.6 134 126 9 33.4 140 131 10 33.6 128 126 11 33.4 142 128 12 31.8 120 113 13 33.4 139 134 14 29.6 129 125 15 30.8 119 102 0 19h 3. Hypoglycaemic activity Female CFLP mice, weighing approximately 25 g, were fasted for 24 hours prior to the study. The compounds under study were administered orally as an aqueous solution to each of 6 mice. 30 minutes later a blood sample 10 p1 was obtained from the tail for the analysis of blood glucose. Immediately after taking this blood sample, glucose lg Kg body weight was administered subcutaneously to each mouse. 6 mice were given water as a control.Blood samples were then obtained from each mouse at 30 minute intervals for 120 minutes. Compounds that produced a significant P 0.05 reduction of blood glucose, compared with control mice given water, at any time interval, were considered active. The area under the blood glucose curve over the 2 hour period after the administration of the glucose was calculated for each compound and compared with the value for control animals.Compounds of Dose Reduction in area underExample No. pmol Kg Blood Glucose Curve 1 2.5 38 2 2.5 64 3 2.5 20 15 12.5 47 4. Cardiac Activity Sprague Dawley male rats 300 400 g are killed and the right and left atria dissected out independently and mounted on a combined tissue holder electrode. The tissues are then immersed in a glass bath containing Krebs solution maintained at 320C. The rate of the spontaneously beating right atrium via an lsometrlc transducer and a ratemeter and the tension of the electrically paced left atrium via an isometric transducer are recorded on an M19 chart recorder. After an initial stabilization period, the tissues are exposed to a maximal concentration of lsoprenallne 10 7M . The tissues are then washed several times until rate and tension return to baseline level. A dose response curve to the test compound is then carried out. Responses to each concentration of test compound are expressed as a percentage of the maximal responses to lsoprenallne. Results are given in the form of a intrinsic activity i.a. maximal effect of test compound with respect to lsoprenallne maximum, l.e. isoprenaline intrinsic activity 1 and b EC50 the molar concentration at which the test compound produces 50 of its own maximum response .Compound of Rate TensionExample No. ECao M i.a.
