# Method for preparing tissue heart valve.

## Abstract
A metod for preparing an aortic heart valve for implantation wherein the area of the septai shelf 18, 19 of the right coronary cusp extending into the valve orifice is substantially reduced. The excised vaive 10 is prepared for fixation by pressurizing the valve to close the valve cusps 20, 21 , and thereafter inverting the aortic vesituble tissue 12 over a valve stent 17 or other cylindrical form circumscribing the valve. As the vestibule tissue is inverted, the septal shelf muscle is pulled toward the outside wall of the valve. When the septal shelf has been displaced to the maximum extent possible while maintaining coaption of the valve leaflets the valve is fixed with a tanning solution. The resulting valve, after being trimmed and mounted for implantation, has improved flow characteristics.
