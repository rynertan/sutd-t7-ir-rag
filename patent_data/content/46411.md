# Photocell.

## Abstract
A photocell is disclosed which comprises a solid elec trolyte film or layer and a pair of electrodes sandwitching therebetween the electrolyte film. The solid electrolyte is AgBr, Agl and silver halide containing double salts or mixed salts. One of the electrodes is optically transparent and the other electrode is made of a material capable of forming a charge transfer complex with the halogen generated on photodissociation of the electrolyte.
