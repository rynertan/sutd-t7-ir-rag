# Improved scaffolding unit.

## Abstract
A scaffolding unit comprising a telescopic post 11,12 , a base plate 19 fitted to the lower end of the post 12 and a supporting arm 20 pivotally mounted on the upper end of the post 11 for rotation about a substantially horizontal axis, transverse to the longitudinal axis of the post, characterised in that the base plate 19 is pivotally mounted so that it can be rotated between a storage or transport position alongside the post 11,12 and an operative position substantially at right angles to and beneath the lower end of the post 12 and in that the supporting arm 20 can be rotated between a storage or transport position alongside the post 11,12 and an operating position overlying the upper end of the post 11 whereby increasing load locks both the base plate 19 and the supporting arm 20 more firmly in position.

## Claims
1. A scaffolding unit comprising a telescopic post, a base plate fitted to the lower end of the post, and a supporting arm pivotally mounted on the upper end of the post for rotation about a substantially horizontal axis, transverse to the longitudinal axis of the post, characterised in that the base plate is pivotally mounted so that it can be rotated between a storage or transport position alongside the post and an operative position substantially at right angles to and beneath the lower end of the post and in that the supporting arm can be rotated between a storage or transport position alongside the post and an operative position overlying the upper end of the post whereby increasing load locks both the base plate and the supporting arm more firmly in position. 2. A scaffolding unit as claimed in claim 1 wherein the free or outer end of the supporting arm is provided with a tongue or other means for engaging between a course of bricks or masonry. 3. A scaffolding unit as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein a foot is welded or otherwise secured to the bottom of the post and the base plate is pivotally mounted on one side of the foot. 4. A scaffolding unit substantially as herein described and as shown in the accompanying drawings.

## Description
THIS INVENTION relates to an improved scaffolding unit which is particularly suitable for use in the erection of brick and masonry walls to single story height.In one form the invention resides in a scaffolding unit comprising a telescopic post, a base plate fitted to the lower end of the post, and a supporting arm pivotally mounted on the upper end of the post for rotation about a substantially horizontal axis, transverse to the longitudinal axis of the post, characterised in that the base plate is pivotally mounted so that it can be rotated between a storage or transport position alongside the post and an operative position substantially at right angles to and beneath the lower end of the post and in that the supporting arm can be rotated between a storage or transport position alongside the post and an operative position overlying the upper end of the post whereby increasing load locks both the base plate and the supporting arm more firmly in posi tion. The invention will be better understood by reference to the following description of one specific embodiment thereof as shown in the accompanying drawings wherein Fig. 1 is a side elevation showing the arm in the operative position Fig. 2 is a plan view corresponding to Fig 1 and Fig. 3 is a side elevation with the unit in the collapsed position.As shown in the drawings the post comprises a pair of tubular members 11 and 12 slidable one within the other, the member 11 being provided with a series of holes 13 which can be aligned with corresponding holes 14 in the lower portion of the post 12 and locked in the desired position by means of a pin 15. A foot 16 substantially triangular in shape is welded to the bottom of the post and the point is reinforced with gussets 17. A base plate 19 is pivotally mounted on one side of the foot so that it can be rotated between a position in which it lies with its apex adjacent the lower portion of the post 12 which is a transport and storage position as shown in Fig. 3 and a positon wherein the plate is substantially horizontal and immediately below the foot 16 as shown in Figs 1 and 2 which is the operative position.In the operative positon the lower end of the post is more or less centrally located with respect to the base plate 19 thus ensuring a secure base for the unit.In accordance with the invention a supporting arm 20 is pivotally mounted on a bracket 21 fixed to the upper end of the post so that the supporting a rm 20 can be rotated from a position in which it lies alongside the upper end of the post as shown in Fig. 3 or it projects substantially at right angles therefrom in the operative position as shown in Figs 1 and 2. The outer or free end of the supporting arm is provided with a tongue 22 which is adapted to engage between a course of bricks or masonry blocks to provide some support for the free end of the supporting arm 20.In accordance with the invention the mounting of the arm 20 is such that in the operative position the arm passes over the top of the post 13 so that any load applied to the arm 20 tends to lock or to hold the supporting arm in the operative position. Likewise the load helps to lock the base plate in position. By positioning the base plate under tte lower end of the post the possibility of the post being pushed into the ground by loads applied thereto is substantially eliminated. The unit may be formed of any suitable metal but aluminium is to be preferred because of the lighter weight. The unit can be readily folded for transport or storage and can be readily handled by one man.If desired an extension piece not shown may be fitted between the tubular member 11 and tubular member 12 to enable the unit to be used for erection of gables or in other situations where a slightly increased height may be required.
