## Description
The invention described herein was made in the course of work supported by grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Science Foundation, and the University of Illinois. This invention pertains to herbicidal compositions and methods, and more particularly to herbicidal compositions and methods for the induction of the accumulation of photodynamic tetrapyrroles in plants. The elimination of undesirable plants by herbicides is critical to modern agricultural practice, and a great deal of time and money is currently dedicated to the discovery of efficient, environmentally safe herbicides. Usually this discovery begins with the screening of a spectrum of biochemicals for herbicidal activity. Those chemicals which exhibit promising herbicidal activity are then subjected to further testing, aimed at defining their efficacy, selectivity, environmental impact, and toxic effects on fish, insects and animals. In this scheme, the understanding of the mode of action is irrelevant and is assigned a low priority. As a consequence the detailed mode of action for some of the widely used herbicides is still not completely understood. See, e.g., It is therefore a purpose of this invention to provide a class of herbicides which will kill undesirable plants via a predetermined and novel mode of action, based on sound biochemical principles. It has now been discovered that compositions comprising δ aminolevulinic acid, optionally in combination with one or more compounds selected from inducers of δ aminolevulinic acid, enhancers of δ aminolevulinic acid conversion to photodynamic tetrapyrroles and inhibitors of conversion of divinyl tetrapyrroles to monovinyl tetrapyrroles, are safe, efficient, selective herbicides, when applied to plants which are subsequently exposed to light. The herbicidal compositions and methods of the present invention result in death and destruction of the plant tissue by a process believed to involve the induced accumulation of photodynamic tetrapyrroles. Thus, in accordance with one aspect, the present invention provides a herbicidal composition comprising δ aminolevulinic acid and a herbicidally suitable carrier, with the proviso that said carrier is not solely water nor solely a common organic solvent. The present invention also provides a method for inducing the accumulation of photodynamic tetrapyrroles in living green plants, said method comprising contacting said plants with δ aminolevulinic acid. Further, the present invention provides a method of controlling undesirable whole green plants, said method comprising The following terms, as used hereinabove and below, have the following meaning unless expressly stated to the contrary Alk alkyl group of unknown chain length ALA δ aminolevulinic acid Chl chlorophyll Chlide The invention will be explained in further detail in conjunction with FIG. 1 six branched Chl Chlorophyll biosynthesis is a major biological phenomenon in the biosphere and is mandatory for the biosynthesis of photosynthetic membranes during greening and for the repair and maintenance of the Chl in mature green plants. The chlorophylls are a group of Mg tetrapyrroles which in green plants catalyze the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy via the process of photosynthesis. There are two basic classes of chlorophyll, designated chlorophyll Until very recently, it was assumed that in green plants the photosynthetic process was catalyzed by only one species of Chl δ Aminolevulinic acid, a 5 carbon amino acid, is found in most living animal and plant cells and is the primary tetrapyrrole precursor. It is available from a variety of specialty chemical sources, e.g. Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO. It is known that excised plant tissues treated in the laboratory with small amounts of ALA will synthesize and accumulate PChlide, which is the immediate precursor of Chlide In 1974, Castelfranco, P.A., P.M. Rich, and S.I. Beal, Plant Physiol. 53 615 618 noticed while studying the lag phase in greening of etiolated tissue that excised cucumber cotyledons soaked in ALA for 16 hours in the dark underwent visible tissue damage upon subsequent exposure to light, which they attributed to tetrapyrroles formed from exogenous ALA. This phenomenon was regarded as a nuisance to be avoided by illumination with red light of very low intensity or by illumination with intermittent light. Until the present invention, it was believed that the accumulation of tetrapyrroles due to exogenous ALA was a phenomenon attributable to the peculiar circumstances of etiolation. Indeed, once the greening of etiolated tissue is initiated, the biosynthesis of chlorophyll proceeds at an abnormally high rate not found in normal green tissue. It has now been discovered that living green plants can be induced by exposure to exogenous ALA to accumulate artificially high amounts of photodynamic tetrapyrrole intermediates in excess of levels normally found in living plants, and that such induced artificially high levels are sufficiently photodynamic so that subsequent exposure of the induced plants to sunlight is lethal. This is surprising, since whole green plants synthesize chlorophyll only at a rate sufficient to keep up with leaf expansion and repair, and it was not previously believed that this rate would be sufficient to allow accumulation of lethal amounts of tetrapyrroles. It is believed that the accumulated tetrapyrroles photosensitize the formation of singlet oxygen, which is a very strong oxidant. The singlet oxygen rapidly oxidizes the lipoprotein components of the plant cellular membranes, thus setting in motion a highly destructive free radical chain reaction, which can be summarized as follows hν photon of light ¹Tet tetrapyrrole in the singlet ground state ³Tet tetrapyrrole in the triplet excited state ³O₂ oxygen in the triplet ground state ¹O₂ oxygen in the singlet excited state UMLP unsaturated membrane lipoproteins It has further been discovered that in addition to exposure to exogenous ALA, exposure of living plants to inducers of ALA will also result in accumulation of massive amounts of photodynamic tetrapyrrole intermediates in the plant tissues. By inducer of ALA or inducer is meant a compound which, when applied to plants, stimulates the plant to produce a higher than normal amount of endogenous ALA, which then has the same effect as exogenous ALA described above. Thus, the herbicidal compositions of this invention may comprise one or more inducers of ALA in combination with ALA itself. Non limiting examples of inducers are, e.g., o phenanthroline, 1,7 phenanthroline, 4,7 phenanthroline, and phenanthridine, all available from, e.g., Alpha Products, Danvers, MA. o Phenanthroline is preferred. It has been reported that 2,2 dipyridyl enhances the biosynthesis and accumulation of tetrapyrroles in excised plant tissues see, e.g., Duggan, J., and M. Gassman, Plant Physiol. 53 206 215 1974 . However, it was not previously known and has now been discovered that certain compounds function as enhancers of ALA in whole green plants. By enhancer of ALA or enhancer is meant a compound which when applied to living whole green plants enhances the capability of the treated plants to convert exogenous or endogenous ALA to photodynamic tetrapyrroles. Thus the herbicidal compositions of the present invention may also comprise one or more enhancers of ALA in combination with ALA and optionally inducers of ALA. Non limiting examples of suitable enhancers in cucumber are, e.g., 2,2 dipyridyl 2,2 DP , 2,3 dipyridyl 2,3 DP , 4,4 dipyridyl 4,4 DP , pyridine aldehyde, pyridine aldoxime, and picolinic acid, all available from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, WI. 2,2 DP, picolinic acid, and pyridine aldehyde are preferred. Certain compounds which function as inducers in one composition may function as enhancers in another composition or at different concentrations. For example, 2,2 DP at concentrations of greater than 30 mM is also an inducer. As can be seen in Fig. 1, three of the branches of the synthetic pathway have been designated as divinyl DV pathways the two monocarboxylic acid pathways are thought to predominate in dicots and in monocots in the presence of light. The remaining three branches have been designated the monovinyl MV pathways the two monocarboxylic acid pathways predominate in monocots in the dark. Plants may be classified as monovinyl or divinyl plants, depending on which pathways predominate. A monovinyl plant is a plant species which in darkness accumulates MV PChlide via the MV monocarboxylic acid biosynthetic routes and upon exposure to light initially forms Chl mainly via the MV monocarboxylic acid routes. Divinyl plants are plant species which accumulate mainly DV PChlide in darkness and upon exposure to light initially form Chl preferably via the DV monocarboxylic acid biosynthetic routes. After several hours in daylight both MV and DV plants appear to form Chl via the DV monocarboxylic acid routes. It has been discovered that in DV plant species, the accumulation of artificially high amounts of DV tetrapyrroles or equal or lower levels of MV tetrapyrroles is lethal to the plant upon subsequent exposure to light, while in MV species the reverse is true,i.e., the accumulation of artificially high amounts of MV tetrapyrroles or equal or lower levels of DV tetrapyrroles is lethal upon subsequent exposure to light. It has also been discovered that certain formulations of ALA and optionally inducers and or enhancers favor accumulation of MV tetrapyrroles in MV plants, while other such formulations favor accumulation of DV tetrapyrroles in MV plants. Likewise, certain formulations of ALA and optionally inducers and or enhancers favor accumulation of DV tetrapyrroles in DV plants, while others favor accumulation of MV tetrapyrroles in DV plants. Further, it has been discovered that certain compounds function as DV inhibitors. By DV inhibitor or inhibitor is meant a compound which, when applied to plants, inhibits the conversion of DV tetrapyrroles to MV tetrapyrroles. Non limiting examples of inhibitors are 2,3 DP, 2,4 DP, and 4,4 DP. 2,3 DP is preferred. Accordingly, by proper selection of suitable formulations of ALA and optionally inducers and or enhancers and or inhibitors, which selection can readily be made by one skilled in the art, it is possible to preferentially kill MV or DV plant species. Further, since different plant species vary in their photodynamic sensitivity, it is possible to select proper formulations to selectively kill one MV plant over another, or one DV plant over another. The herbicidal compositions of the present invention may thus, for example, comprise combinations of two or more compounds ie ALA plus one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of inducers, enhancers and inhibitors, e.g. ALA one or more inducers, ALA one or more enhancers, ALA one or more inhibitors, ALA one or more inducers one or more enhancers, ALA one or more inducers one or more inhibitors and ALA one or more enhancers one or more inhibitors. The herbicidally suitable carrier of the present compositions may comprise one or more of the following solid carrier s e.g. colloidal magnesium aluminum silicate, pumice, talc or combinations thereof solvent s e.g. water, 0.45 acetone 0.45 ethanol 0.1 Tween 80 9 water v v v v , 0.45 acetone 0.45 methanol 0.1 Tween 80 9 water v v v v , 0.1 1 Tween 80 in water v v , 0.9 polyethylene glycol PEG 0.1 Tween 80 9 water v v v , 0.1 0.7 PEG 0.2 0.8 methanol 0.1 Tween 80 9 water v v v v , 0.9 methanol 0.1 Tween 80 9 water v v v , 0.45 acetone 0.45 ethanol 0.2 Tween 80 0.9 ethylene glycol 18 water v v v v v , benzene, toluene, xylene, kerosene, 2 methoxyethanol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, diethylene glycol diethyl ether, formamide, methylformamide, cyclohexanone, isophorone buffer s e.g. citric acid wetting agent s e.g. sodium N methyl N oleoyltaurate, an alkylphenoxy polyoxyethylene ethanol, sodium α olefin sulfonate, sodium isopropylnaphthalene sulfonate, polyoxyethylated vegetable oil dispersing agent s e.g. sodium lignin sulfonate, the sodium salt of a naphthalene sulfonic acid formaldehyde condensate, hydroxyethyl cellulose defoaming agent s e.g. silicone emetic s e.g. sodium tripolyphosphate, tetrapotassium pyrophosphate, arecotine, apomorphine, copper sulfate stench es e.g. pyridine penetrant s surfactant s emulsifier s, adjuvant s e.g. phytoblend oils . The present compositions may also comprise one or more other known herbicides, e.g. Goal Rohm Haas Co., Philadelphia, PA , Lasso Monsanto Co., St. Louis, MO , Roundup Monsanto Co., St. Louis, MO , or Sutan Plus Stauffer Chemical Co., Westport, CT . Of course, any such additional component must be compatible with the herbicidal components of the present invention and with the other ingredients in the mixture. The composition may be formulated in any manner conventionally used for herbicidal preparations, e.g. as a solution, suspension, emulsion, flowable concentrate, emulsifiable concentrate, gel, paste, foam, cream, aerosol, wettable powder, dust, dispersible granules, and the like, according to procedures known to those skilled in the art. Preferably, the composition is a solution, suspension, emulsion, aerosol, flowable or emulsifiable concentrate, or wettable powder. Of course, the formulation must be such that the active ingredient s penetrate s the plant tissue and translocates to the sites of tetrapyrrole synthesis. When the compositions are made in solution they may conveniently comprise concentrations of from about 2 to about 30 mM ALA and optionally from about 10 to about 30 mM inducer, enhancer, or inhibitor. The herbicidal compositions of the present invention may be applied topically, e.g. as a dust, soak, dip, spray, mist, or fog, in an amount sufficient to induce the accumulation of photodynamic tetrapyrroles. Alternatively, the herbicidal compositions may be applied to the soil for uptake by plant roots and translocation to the vegetative part of the plant, or as a pre emergence treatment to prevent seed germination. The amount of herbicidal composition to be applied will vary, depending on the particular active ingredient s selected, but in general will be an amount sufficient to supply from about 10 g to about 15 kg ALA per acre and optionally from about 10 g to about 10 kg of an inducer, enhancer, or inhibitor per acre. Means of determining optimum application rates are within the purview of those skilled in the art. Once the plant has been induced to begin accumulating artificially high amounts of tetrapyrroles by exposure to the herbicidal composition of the present invention, the plant may be shielded from exposure to light to allow maximum tetrapyrrole accumulation. Such dark incubation is not required for activity but tends to optimize efficiency of the herbicidal compositions. The plants can be shielded in any convenient manner, as by wrapping them in dark paper, cloth, or foil, or by placing them in a dark room or container. Under field conditions, the ideal method to provide a period of dark incubation is to apply the herbicidal composition at dusk or during the night, at a time chosen to allow the plants to rest in the dark for at least one hour. It is to be understood that in order to facilitate tetrapyrrole accumulation, the dark need not be total absence of light, but rather substantial absence of light at wavelengths of from 300 to 700 nm. Preferably, the plants are allowed to rest in the dark for from about 1 to about 20 hours. One to 8 hours is particularly preferred. Thereafter the plants are exposed to about 200 ft. candles or more of light at wavelengths of about 300 to about 700 nm. The light may be supplied by any convenient source, e.g. an incandescent lamp, metal halide lamp, sunlamp, or a cool white or skylight fluorescent bulb. In the field, of course, the preferred source of light is sunlight. The plants are exposed to light for a period of time sufficient to oxidize most of the unsaturated membrane lipoproteins a period of from about 1 to about 14 days is preferred. Herbicidal activity is indicated by bleaching of the leaves, stems, and or nodes, followed by wilting and death. If all the leaf buds are not treated, the plant may recover and require repeated treatment. A further understanding of this invention can be had from the following non limiting examples. As used hereinabove and below unless expressly stated to the contrary, all temperatures and temperature ranges refer to the centigrade system and the terms ambient and room temperature refer to about 20 25 C. The term percent or refers to weight percent and the terms mole and moles refer to gram moles. Level of significance refers to the probability that for a population for which the correlation coefficient r is equal to zero, a sample of size n can be taken, for which the correlation coefficient equals or exceeds the calculated value of r reported for the given sample. The abbreviation n.s. stands for not significant . The following examples describe model systems whereby persons skilled in the art can readily determine photodynamic compounds and compositions useful in the present invention. Cucumber Six day old green seedlings were thinned to 10 plants per container and ALA Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO was applied as a fine spray. The ALA was dissolved at concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 mM in a solvent mixture made up of 0.45 acetone 0.45 ethanol 0.1 Tween 80 9 water v v v v , adjusted to pH 3.5 with dilute HCl. Each 9 cm diameter glass container approximately 63.6 cm² leaf surface area was sprayed with 0.25 ml of ALA treated or 0.25 ml of solvent control , which is equivalent to a spray rate of about 40 gallons acre and a field application rate of ALA of about 0 to 524 g acre. The solutions were delivered as a very fine and uniform spray with a modified Pierce Quixspray aerosol spray kit Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL , as follows 0.25 ml of solution was placed in a sawed off 10 ml conical centrifuge tube, which was placed inside the Quixspray spray jar. The delivery of a very fine mist was achieved by pumping the solution through a fine bore polypropylene tubing 0.3 mm inside diameter, or 0.5 mm inside diameter for more viscous solutions . One end of the fine bore tubing was inserted into the Quixspray intake hose, while the other end was dipped into the solution in the conical centrifuge tube. In this manner it took 10 20 sec to deliver 0.25 ml spray, and this in turn provided ample time for thoroughly spraying the seedlings to leaf saturation. Each treatment was performed in duplicate. After spraying, the plants were wrapped in aluminum foil and were placed inside a cardboard box which was wrapped in two layers of black plastic. The dark boxes were then incubated overnight 17 hours at 28 C, in order to allow the biosynthesis and accumulation of tetrapyrroles to take place. The next morning, the treated plants were sampled for their tetrapyrrole content. The plants were taken in the black boxes to a dark room equipped with a green safelight which permits the manipulation of the treated tissues without affecting in any way their tetrapyrrole content. One of each two cotyledons of every two replicates was excised. Two to three gram batches were then homogenized in a Sorval Omnimixer DuPont Instruments, Newtown, CT in acetone 0.1 N NH₄OH 9 1 v v at a rate of 18 ml of solvent per 3 g of tissue. The resulting 80 acetone extract containing various tetrapyrroles was cleared from lipoproteins and cell debris by centrifugation at 39,000 x g for 10 min at 0 C. Chlorophyll, a fully esterified tetrapyrrole, was removed from the aqueous acetone solution by extraction with hexane according to the method of Rebeiz, C.A., J.R. Mathheis, B.B. Smith, C.C. Rebeiz, and D.F. Dayton, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 166 446 465 1975 . The more polar mono and dicarboxylic tetrapyrroles such as Proto, MP E , and PChlide remained in the hexane extracted aqueous acetone fraction. The chemical structure of these tetrapyrroles has been discussed at length in Rebeiz, C.A. and J. Lascelles, in Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a fully corrected photon counting spectrofluorometer Model SLM 8000 DS SLM Aminco, Urbana, IL equipped with two red sensitive, extended S₂₀ photomultipliers EMI 9658 , and interfaced with a microcomputer system Model 9825 S Hewlett Packard, Sunnyvale, CA . Tetrapyrrole solutions were monitored at room temperature on 0.3 ml samples, in cylindrical microcells, 3 mm in diameter. Conversion of the digital spectral data into concentrations was performed automatically by the microcomputer, following the recording of the pertinent spectra. The emission and excitation spectra were recorded at excitation and emission bandwidths of 2 mm. Monovinyl tetrapyrroles were distinguished from divinyl tetrapyrroles by their well established spectrofluorometric properties in ether at 77 K see Rebeiz and Lascelles, Absorption spectra were recorded with an Aminco dual wavelength spectrophotometer model DW 2 SLM Aminco, Urbana, IL operated in the split beam mode, at a slit width of 2 nm. The acetone insoluble residue which was left behind after centrifugation of the tissue homogenate was suspended in distilled water with an all glass tissue grinder. Total proteins were determined on a small aliquot of the suspension, after delipidation, according to the method of Rebeiz, C.A., P.A. Castelfranco, and A.H. Engelbrecht, Plant Physiol. 40 281 286 1965 . The seedlings with half of their cotyledons still intact were then used for assessing photodynamic damage by light. The seedlings were exposed to daylight in the greenhouse 400 to 5000 ft. candles at noon, depending on cloud cover and their growth was evaluated over a period of 10 days. In order to secure a permanent record of the growth behavior of the treated plants, the latter were photographed daily Kodacolor, 400 ASA, Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY with a Pentax Super Program camera Helix, Champaign, IL equipped with an SMC Pentax A 1 1.4 50 mm lens and a digital back that imprinted on each photograph the date or time of day at which the photograph was taken. Per cent photodynamic damage was assessed as the percent death of the sprayed tissue, in response to exposure to sunlight. For example, if 10 out of 10 sprayed leaves or cotyledons died as a consequence of exposure to daylight, the photodynamic damage was considered to be 100 . If only five out of the ten sprayed leaves or cotyledons had died, the photodynamic damage was considered to be only 50 , etc. The extent of photodynamic damage was related to the amount of accumulated tetrapyrroles by conventional correlation analysis. The amounts of tetrapyrrole that accumulated were expressed in nmoles per 100 mg of tissue protein. The results of these experiments are shown in Table I and in FIG. III. FIG. 3 shows the time course of photodynamic damage in 6 day old cucumber seedlings treated with 20 mM 524 g acre ALA, followed by a 17 hour dark incubation at 28 The symptoms of photodynamic damage assumed two forms bleaching of the green leafy tissue, which spread gradually, e.g. FIG. 3 H and severe bleaching of the hypocotyl, e.g. FIG. 3 D,F. In both cases, this was accompanied by a severe loss of turgidity of the affected tissues. It is believed that the photodynamic damage affected the cell membranes which became leaky and this in turn resulted in a rapid and severe dehydration of the tissues. For example, at ALA concentrations of 10 20 mM 262 524 g acre a large number of seedlings had undergone irreversible damage after four to five hours of exposure to daylight FIG. 3 F . The cause of death was usually due to severe dehydration, bleaching, and collapse of the leafy and or hypocotyl tissues FIG. 3 F,H . On the other hand, treated samples kept for the same period of time in darkness were unaffected see Example V . In a procedure analogous to that of Example I, the following representative compounds have been found to be effective inducers of ALA Results are given in Table II and in FIG. 4 FIG. 4 shows damage done to treated plants after 5 days. 2,2 Dipyridyl 2,2 DP is a relatively cheap and easily available chemical. The procedure of Example I was repeated using various mixtures of 2,2 DP Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO and ALA. The results are shown in Tables III, IV, and V The results demonstrate that in the presence of low amounts of ALA 5 mM, 131 g acre , increasing amounts of 2,2 DP 1, 2, or 4 mM 27, 54, or 107 g acre, respectively enhanced significantly the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic capabilities of the treated tissues it also enhanced the photodynamic herbicidal properties of the mixtures Table III . In the presence of various amounts of 2,2 DP, ranging from 5 10 mM 134 268 g acre , increasing amounts of ALA 1 5 mM, 26 131 g acre also resulted in increased tetrapyrrole accumulation and in enhanced photodynamic herbicidal activity of the mixtures up to a concentration of 5 mM ALA 131 g acre Table IV A, B . Further increases in the amount of added 2,2 DP appeared to enhance the photodynamic herbicidal effectiveness of the ALA 2,2 DP treatment only at very low ALA concentrations i.e., 3 mM, 78 g acre Table IV C . ALA and 2,2 DP appeared to act synergistically to produce photodynamic damage Table V . The addition of 15 mM 184 g acre dimethyl sulfoxide a penetration enhancer to the ALA 2,2 DP mixture was inhibitory and did not appear to enhance the effectiveness of the spray Table V . As described above, 2,2 DP is preferred as an enhancer of ALA. However, in a procedure analogous to that of Example I, the following representative compounds have also been found to be effective enhancers, producing a synergistic effect in combination with ALA Results are shown in Table VI and in FIG. 5 FIG. 5 depicts experiments I P and U BB 5 days after treatment. Six day old green cucumber seedlings were sprayed according to the procedure of Example I with high concentrations 20 mM each of ALA and 2,2 DP solutions, after which the treated plants and the controls which were sprayed with the solvent only were incubated in the dark for 17 hours in order to induce the accumulation of tetrapyrroles. The next morning, the control and treated plants were photographed under cool white fluorescent light and under ultraviolet 360 nm light, in the latter case in order to detect visually the accumulated tetrapyrroles by their red fluorescence. The photographed plants were then exposed to daylight about 4500 ft. candles in the greenhouse in order to elicit photodynamic damage. Duplicate sets of treated and control plants were kept in darkness for an equal length of time, in order to determine whether the accumulation of massive amounts of tetrapyrrole causes damage in darkness. After 6 hours of exposure to daylight or to darkness, the treated and control plants were compared FIG. 6 . FIG. 6 shows the requirement of light in addition to tetrapyrrole accumulation for the occurence of photodynamic damage. A,B treated A and control B plants immediately after 17 hours of dark incubation C,D the same treated C and control D plants viewed under 360 nm ultraviolet light, in order to show the accumulation of red fluorescing tetrapyrroles in the stems of the treated seedlings E,F the same treated E and control F plants photographed from another angle to show the accumulation of red fluorescing tetrapyrroles in the stems, the growing points and leafy parts of the treated seedlings G,H the same treated G and control H plants after about 6 hours of exposure to daylight I,J treated I and control J plants left in darkness for 6 hours while plants G,H were being exposed to daylight. The induction of massive tetrapyrrole accumulation in the ALA 2,2 DP treated plants, but not in the controls, is depicted pictorally in FIG. VI C, D, E, F. Only the ALA 2,2 DP treated plants exhibited red tetrapyrrole fluorescence in the stems and in the leafy tissues FIG. 6 C, E . After 6 hours of exposure to daylight, the ALA 2,2 DP treated plants were completely destroyed FIG. 6 G while the control plants grew normally FIG. 6 H . Finally, the duplicate controls and ALA 2,2 DP treated plants which were kept for 6 hours in darkness remained green and healthy FIG. 6 I, J . These results clearly indicate that the ALA 2,2 DP treatment caused photodynamic damage only in the presence of light, and demonstrates the correlation between damage and accumulated tetrapyrroles. FIG. VII describes fluorescence emission A and excitation B spectra in ether at 77 K of the MP E PChlide pools of 6 day old cucumber seedlings treated with 0.25 ml of 5 mM ALA 15 mM 2,2 DP, and placed in darkness at 28 C for 17 hours. The MP E PChlide pools were extracted and transferred to ether, immediately after incubation as described in Example I. The emission spectrum, showing MV DV MP E emission at 593 nm and MV DV PChlide emission at 626 nm was elicited by excitation at 420 nm. The excitation spectra showing MV and DV MP E maxima at 417 and 423 nm respectively as well as MV By 0 0 and DV Bx 0 0 PChlide maxima at 437 and 451 nm respectively, were recorded at the indicated emission maxima i.e., F values shown in FIG. 7 . The spectrofluorometric properties of these pools are described in detail in the two papers by Belanger and Rebeiz, The correlation between ALA 2,2 DP induced tetrapyrrole accumulation and photodynamic damage was in general significant at the 1 to 0.1 level of significance Tables I, III V the best correlation was observed between PChlide accumulation and photodynamic damage. A significant correlation between MP E and Proto accumulation and photodynamic damage was observed only after their concentration had reached a certain threshold concentration Tables I, III vs. IV, V . As depicted in FIG. 7, significant amounts of both MV and DV PChlide and MP E accumulate in ALA 2,2 DP treated plants. FIG. 8 shows the time course of PChlide and MP E disappearance in daylight. In a manner analogous to Example I, 6 day old cucumber seedlings were treated with 0.25 ml of 5 mM ALA 15 mM 2,2 DP, pH 3.5. They were then placed in darkness at 28 C for 17 hours. They were analyzed for tetrapyrrole content at the end of the 17 hour dark incubation and after the indicated times of exposure to daylight 3000 ft. candles at noon . Negligible amounts of Proto were formed during dark incubation. In this particular experiment the average photodynamic damage of six replicates amounted to 80 . After 8 hours of exposure to daylight in the greenhouse and after a brief transient rise in MP E content, 76 and 93 of the MP E and PChlide pools, respectively, had disappeared, probably as a consequence of photodestruction. It is known that ALA induced PChlide is destroyed and not converted to Chl under high light intensities such as the ones 4000 to 6000 ft. candles which are encountered on a typical clear day in the greenhouse see, e.g., Sisler, E.C., and W.H. Klein, Physiol. Plant. 16 315 322 1963 . Six day old cucumber seedlings were sprayed according to the procedure of Example I with 0.25 ml of solvent controls or with solvent containing 5 mM ALA indicated concentrations of 2,2 DP at pH 3.5, and were placed overnight in darkness at 28 C. The next morning, i.e. after 17 hours of dark incubation, the control and treated plants were exposed to daylight. At the same time, similar greenhouse grown seedlings of the same age were likewise sprayed with solvent only controls or with ALA 2,2 DP treated and were exposed to daylight in the greenhouse without an intervening dark incubation period. The results of this experiment are depicted in Table VII It is evident from Table VII that a post spray dark incubation period is recommended for the full expression of the ALA 2,2 DP photodynamic herbicidal activity in solvent systems such as the ones used in this experiment. Treated plants that were subjected to a post spray dark incubation exhibited about 3 fold more photodynamic damage than treated plants that were not subjected to a post spray dark incubation period. The procedure of Example I was performed on the following representative monocots and dicots An examination of the results of this limited survey revealed that plants reacted in three different ways to the ALA 2,2 DP spray. One group of dicots, which is exemplified by cucumber FIGS. 3, 6 exhibited what is referred to as Type I herbicidal response in Table VIII. This group of plants reacted to the ALA 2,2 DP spray exactly as did cucumber. Leafy tissues, stems and growing points accumulated significant amounts of tetrapyrroles and were subject to severe photodynamic damage Table VIII . Usually, the seedlings died very rapidly, and the rapidity of the response depended on the light intensity in the greenhouse. For example, at the low spray concentrations used in this work 131 g acre ALA 402 g acre 2,2 DP , only 4 to 5 hours of exposure to daylight was sufficient to cause the death of the plants on clear, bright days 4000 to 6000 ft. candles at noon . On the other hand, 2 to 3 days of insolation were required on very cloudy days 400 ft. candles at noon in order to achieve the same results. Some of the plant species that exhibited this type of photodynamic herbicidal response such as lambsquarter, mustard, red root pigweed and common purslane are considered to be serious weeds. While 13 day old tomato plants, with fully expanded cotyledons and with small developing primary leaves exhibited a Type I response Table VIII , younger 8 to 10 day old tomato seedlings were much less affected by the spray 40 photodynamic damage . Other dicots such as cotton, kidney bean and soybean exhibited a different response to the ALA 2,2 DP treatment. This response is referred to as Type II in Table VIII. Plants belonging to this group accumulate significant amounts of tetrapyrroles in the leafy tissues, but not in the stems as in cotton and soybean. Other species such as kidney bean also accumulated some tetrapyrroles in the stems. Leaves that accumulate tetrapyrroles exhibit very severe photodynamic damage and die within a few hours FIG. 9. However, the cotyledons, stems, and growing points remain unaffected. Such plants usually recovered from the original photodynamic damage by producing new leaves FIG. 9 and may require a second application. In this group the Type II response also depended on the age of the seedlings. For example, 6 day old soybean in which the primary leaves were still enclosed within the cotyledons were completely unaffected by the ALA 2,2 DP treatment. On the other hand, 9 day old soybean plants, with expanded primary leaves, exhibited a typical Type II photodynamic herbicidal response FIG. IX B . The only monitored monocot that exhibited this type of response was perennial blue grass in which about 30 40 , of the sprayed leaves died the plants subsequently recovered and developed new leaves. The third type of photodynamic herbicidal response elicited by the ALA 2,2 DP treatment is referred to as a type III response. Based on available data, monocots exhibited this type of response. Although the ALA 2,2 DP treatment induced the accumulation of significant amounts of tetrapyrrole by the plants, the photodynamic damage was either imperceptible as in wheat, oat, and corn, or when noticeable as in barley, was confined to the upper half of a small proportion of the sprayed plants. In that case the photodynamic damage consisted of small necrotic regions. The seedlings continued to grow vigorously and developed into healthy plants FIG. 9 . FIG. 9 shows Type II and Type III photodynamic herbicidal response of soybean and barley respectively A,B control A and treated B soybean plants after 3 hours of exposure to daylight C,D the same control C and treated D plants after 11 days in the greenhouse E,F control E and treated F barley seedlings after 2 days of exposure to daylight in the greenhouse G,H the same control G and treated H barley plants after 15 days in the greenhouse. The photodynamic herbicidal formulations described in these examples exhibited an excellent measure of species, age and organ dependent selectivity. While dicotyledenous weeds such as lambsquarter, mustard, red root pigweed and common purselane were highly susceptible to the tetrapyrrole induced photodynamic damage, monocots such as corn, wheat, oats, and barley were not adversely affected by the spray. Other dicots were either unaffected by the spray at an early stage of development as in soybean, or recovered fully from a rapid destruction of the primary leaves by producing new and healthy leaves, as was observed for kidney bean, soybean and cotton. Furthermore some tissues which accumulated tetrapyrroles such as bean stems did not exhibit any photodynamic damage. The biochemical basis of this organ, age and species dependent photodynamic herbicidal selectivity appears to be dependent among other things on the rates of tetrapyrrole turnover and on a differential enhancement of the MV and DV tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathways in any given plant species. MV plant species normally dispose of damaging DV tetrapyrroles by converting them to MV tetrapyrroles, which the plant can metabolize efficiently. However, when sprayed with compounds which inhibit the conversion of DV tetrapyrroles to MV tetrapyrroles, such as 2,3 DP, 2,4 DP, or 4,4 DP, the conversion of DV tetrapyrroles to MV tetrapyrroles is inhibited and the MV plant species accumulates damaging DV tetrapyrroles. Since the MV plants cannot metabolize DV tetrapyrroles efficiently, the DV tetrapyrroles accumulate and create photodynamic damage upon exposure of the plant to light. This is an example of manipulation of the biosynthetic pathway according to the present invention to selectively kill an undesired plant species in this example, a MV plant . Giant foxtail Ten day old seedlings were sprayed in the late afternoon with 0.25 ml of one of the herbicidal compositions A D below to provide the dosage indicated. Controls were sprayed with solvent only. The solvent used was 0.45 acetone 0.45 ethanol 0.1 Tween 80 9 water v v v v , adjusted to pH 3.5 with HCl. The plants were wrapped in foil overnight, then the next day were unwrapped and placed in the greenhouse for 10 days, at which time the photodynamic damage was determined according to the method of Example I. Results are shown in Table IX and in FIG. 10 FIG. 10 shows the damage done to the various treated plants after 2 days. The above results demonstrate the development of a MV specific herbicides by following experimental protocols as described above. When treated plants are not wrapped in foil i.e., under greenhouse or field conditions , the solvent may evaporate too rapidly to allow the active component s of the herbicidal compositions to penetrate and to translocate to the chloroplasts inside the tissue where tetrapyrrole formation takes place. The following examples describe the development of model greenhouse and field solvent systems. Cucumber seedlings were germinated and grown as in Example I. Six day old green seedlings were thinned to 10 plants per container and each container was sprayed with 0.25 ml of one of the herbicidal compositions A P below to provide the spray rate indicated. The solvent used was 0.45 acetone 0.45 ethanol 0.1 Tween 80 9 water v v v v at the indicated pH. The plants were treated in the morning am or afternoon pm as indicated and left, unwrapped, in the greenhouse for 10 days, at which time the photodynamic damage was determined according to the method of Example I. The results are given in Table X The above data indicate a that when plants are not wrapped in foil, a solvent pH of 3.5 is better than a solvent pH of 6 i.e., ALA penetrates better in protonated form and b it appears that at higher concentrations of ALA enough tetrapyrroles are accumulated even in the presence of sunlight to provide strong herbicidal activity. Methanol is a cofactor in PChlide synthesis Rebeiz, C.A., and P.A. Castelfranco, Plant Physiol. 47 24 32 1971 . In order to insure that availability of methanol is not a rate limiting factor in the synthesis and accumulation of photodynamic tetrapyrroles, exogenous methanol was added to the system in the solvent. Cucumber seedlings were germinated and grown as in Example I. Six day old green seedlings were thinned to 10 plants per container and each container was sprayed with 0.25 ml of one of the herbicidal compositions A L below at the spray rate indicated. The controls were sprayed with solvent only. The solvent used was 0.45 acetone 0.45 methanol 0.1 Tween 80 9 water v v v v , pH adjusted to 3.5 with HCl. The plants were treated in the morning am or afternoon pm as indicated and left, unwrapped, in the greenhouse for 10 days, at which time the photodynamic damage was determined according to the method of Example I. Results are shown in Table XI Comparison with the pH 3.5 treatment in Table X shows that substitution of methanol for ethanol in the solvent system consisting of 0.45 acetone 0.45 ethanol 0.1 Tween 80 9 water v v v v resulted in increased photodynamic damage. Tween 80 is a well known surfactant available from a variety of sources e.g., Nutritional Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH . It usually facilitates the translocation of sprayed herbicides from the surface of the tissue to the site of action. Cucumber seedlings were germinated and grown as in Example I. Six day old green seedlings were thinned to 10 plants per container and each container was sprayed at the time indicated with 0.25 ml of herbicide to provide 130g ALA 390g 2,2 DP acre in the solvents indicated below. All solvents were adjusted to pH 3.5 with dilute HCl. All plants except C and H were placed unwrapped in the greenhouse for 10 days, at which time the photodynamic damage was determined according to Example I. In experiments C and H, the treated plants were initially wrapped in foil and incubated in the dark overnight at 28 Results are shown in Table XII Tween 80 exhibited the best effect at 0.5 1 v v both in the morning and afternoon sprays. Polyethylene glycol PEG leaves a thin protective film when sprayed on tissue surfaces accordingly, it was added to the solvent to determine whether such a film will slow down solvent evaporation and permit a better translocation of the ALA 2,2 DP to the chloroplasts. Cucumber seedlings were germinated and grown as in Example I. Six day old green seedlings were thinned to 10 plants per container and each container was sprayed at the time indicated with 0.25 ml of one of compositions A L below at the spray rate indicated. The controls were sprayed with 0.25 ml of solvent only. The solvent was 0.9 PEG 600 0.1 Tween 80 9 water v v v , pH 3.5. The plants were placed unwrapped in the greenhouse for 10 days, at which time the photodynamic damage was determined according to Example I. In Experiments C and I, the treated plants were initially wrapped in foil and incubated in the dark overnight at 28 Results are shown in Table XIII PEG appeared to be beneficial when incorporated into formulations containing water and Tween 80 compare Table XII E and J to Table XIII B and H , respectively . Cucumber seedlings were germinated and grown as in Example I. Six day old green seedlings were thinned to 10 plants per container and each container was sprayed with 0.25 ml of herbicidal composition to provide a spray rate of 80g ALA 240g 2,2 DP acre in the solvents indicated below.

Results are shown in Table XIV None of the just described formulations proved to be superior to those containing only PEG at the low ALA concentrations used in these experiments. However, morning sprays proved superior to afternoon sprays compare A F to G L . Cucumber seedlings were germinated and grown as in Example I. Six day old green seedlings were thinned to 10 plants per container and each container was sprayed at the time indicated with 0.25 ml of one of the herbicidal compositions A HH below to provide the spray rate indicated. Controls were treated with 0.25 ml solvent only. The solvent used was 0.7 PEG 0.2 methanol 0.1 Tween 80 9 water v v v v pH 3.5. The plants were placed unwrapped in the greenhouse for 10 days, at which time the photodynamic damage was determined according to Example I. In experiments O, R, AA, and DD, the treated plants were initially wrapped in foil and incubated in the dark overnight at 28 The results are shown in Table XV Cucumber seedlings were germinated and grown as in Example I. Six day old green seedlings were thinned to 10 plants per container and each container was sprayed with 0.25 ml of one of the herbicidal compositions A D below at the spray rate indicated. The solvent used was 0.45 acetone 0.45 ethanol 0.2 Tween 80 0.9 ethylene glycol 18 water v v v v v , pH 3.5. The plants were treated in the afternoon and left, unwrapped, in the greenhouse for 10 days, at which time the photodynamic damage was determined according to the method of Example I. Results are shown in Table XVI These preliminary results indicate that ethylene glycol is also a desirable adjuvant for the ALA 2,2 DP herbicidal formulation. Translation of the greenhouse formulations to specific field situations is straightforward. Field lots 0.25 m² of Kentucky blue grass plus red fescue infested with creeping Charley Lot 2 was sprayed in the late afternoon on 5 22 85 with 10 ml to yield a doage rate of 525 g ALA 390 g 2,2 DP acre in 0.1 Tween 80 9.9 water v v , adjusted to pH 4.5 with dilute HCl. The control lot was sprayed with solvent only. The treatment was repeated on 5 30 85. Fig. 11 C shows the control lot on 5 22 85, demonstrating the extent of infestation. Fig. 11 D shows the treated lot on 6 4 85, showing 95 photodynamic damage calculated according to the method of Example I of all broadleaf weeds in the treated area. Note the survival of the bluegrass, unscathed. Lot 4 was sprayed once in the morning of 6 1 85 with 10 ml to yield a dosage rate of 525 g ALA 390 g 2,2 DP acre in 0.7 PEG 600 0.2 methanol 0.1 Tween 80 9 water v v v v , adjusted to pH 3.5 with HCl. The control lot was sprayed once with solvent only. Fig. 11 E shows the control lot on 6 9 85. Fig. 11 F shows the treated lot on 6 9 85, showing 95 photodynamic damage calculated according to the procedure of Example I of all broadleaf weeds in the treated area. Again, note the survival of the bluegrass. Cucumber seedlings were germinated and grown as in Example I. Six day old green seedlings were thinned to 10 plants per container. A 20 mM ALA 15 mM 2,2 DP solution was prepared in 0.45 acetone 0.45 ethanol 0.1 Tween 80 9 water v v v v and the pH was adjusted to 3.5 with HCl. The indicated amounts of this composition were added to the vermiculite of 8 day old plants in the greenhouse in the late afternoon. Control plants were treated with solvent only. The plants were placed unwrapped in the greenhouse for 10 days, at which time the photodynamic damage was determined according to the method of Example I. Results are shown in Table XVII and in FIG. 12 FIG. 12 shows the damage done by compositions A, B, C, and D the following morning A, B, C, D , and by all compositions 2 days later A , B , C , D , E J . It appears that ALA 2,2 DP when applied to the medium in which the plants are growing can be taken up by the roots and translocated upward. The photodynamic damage appears to be most prominent in the hypocotyls as shown in FIG. 12. Ten cucumber seeds were planted in vermiculite in each of several glass containers 9 cm deep x 9 cm in diameter . The seeds were watered and various amounts of 10 mM ALA 7.5 mM 2,2 DP in 0.45 acetone 0.45 ethanol 0.1 Tween 80 9 water v v v v , pH 3.0 were added as indicated. Controls were treated with solvent only. The containers were left unwrapped in the greenhouse for 2 weeks, at which time the germination was determined. Results are given in Table XVIII It appears from the above data that ALA 2,2 DP at very high concentrations can act as a pre emergence herbicide. Interaction with other herbicides was found to be either additive, synergistic, or antagonistic, as described below. Cucumber seedlings were germinated and grown as in Example I. Six day old green seedlings were thinned to 10 plants per container and sprayed in the late afternoon with 0.25 ml of one of the herbicidal compositions A L below at the spray rate indicated. Controls were sprayed with solvent only. The solvent was 0.45 acetone 0.45 ethanol 0.1 Tween 80 9 water v v v v , adjusted to pH 3.5 with HCl. The plants were wrapped in foil overnight, then the next day unwrapped and placed in the greenhouse for 10 days, at which time the photodynamic damage was determined according to the method of Example I. Results are shown in Table XIX and in FIG. 13 FIG. 13 shows damage done to treated plants after 5 days. Porphyria is a metabolic dysfunction which results in the accumulation of photodynamic tetrapyrroles in the various tissues of the human body. Certain drugs routinely used in various medical treatments are suspected of triggering porphyric attacks in susceptible patients. In order to determine whether such drugs could act as enhancers and or inducers of ALA, their potential herbicidal effectiveness in conjunction with ALA was investigated. Cucumber seedlings were germinated and grown as in Example I. Six day old green seedlings were thinned to 10 plants per container and sprayed in the late afternoon with 0.25 ml of one of the herbicidal compositions A X below at the spray rate indicated. Controls were sprayed with solvent only. The solvent was 0.45 acetone 0.45 ethanol 0.1 Tween 80 9 water v v v v , adjusted to pH 3.5 with HCl. The plants were wrapped in foil overnight, then the next day unwrapped and placed in the greenhouse for 10 days, at which time the photodynamic damage was determined according to the method of Example I. Results are shown in Table XX In general, none of the drugs that were tested proved to be significant inducers or enhancers of ALA. These examples serve to demonstrate the novel herbicidal concept of the present invention. The photodynamic mode of action is different from other known herbicidal modes of action in two main respects δ Aminolevulinic acid is a natural metabolite present in all living cells it is a natural component of the biosphere and is readily biodegradable. The same is true for the products of ALA dark metabolism, i.e., for the tetrapyrrole intermediates of the Chl biosynthetic pathway, which have been demonstrated to disappear very rapidly upon exposure of the plant to light. It therefore appears that the photodynamic herbicidal compositions and methods of the present invention are likely to have no adverse impact on the environment.
