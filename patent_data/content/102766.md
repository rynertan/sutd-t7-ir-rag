# Draft control system for a vehicle.

## Abstract
A filtered draft load signal FDRFT is derived from the signals A1 A3 from three draft load sensors 16 and is subtracted from a filtered command load signal DCOM, which is derived from a signal A6 from a load setting lever 36 , to provide a load error signal LERR. A model error signal DMOD is derived from LERR by a first order filter function DMOD 0.96 DMOD 0.06 LERR DMOD is filtered to provide a filtered model error signal FMOD 0.17 FMOD 0.83 DMOD. FDRFT is subtracted from FMOD to provide a model error signal ELIT. A gain increment DELGN is proportionally to the product of GAA and ELIT and LERR where GAA is a inversely related to DCOM. A gain factor GAIN3 is obtained by integrating DELGN and the ultimate draft error signal DERR is derived as 17.5 GAIN3. LERR ZPOS A 4 , where ZPOS is derived to represent the position of the rockshaft 22 at which the implement 14 enters the ground and A 4 is the actual rockshaft position given by a transducer 28 . Control by the draft error signal DERR is overridden by a position error signal PERR 17.5 A 5 A 4 when PERR is greater than DERR. A 5 is provided by a rockshaft positioning lever 32 used by the operator to lift the implement from the ground and lower it into the ground again.
