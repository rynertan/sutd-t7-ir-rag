# A transverse gearbox for a vehicle with an in line engine.

## Abstract
The gearbox has a casing formed of a bottom part 302 and a top part 301 with a parting plane therebetween inclined downwardly from front to rear. At the front, an input, engine shaft 312 enters the casing and is coupled by bevel gears 311, 313 to the gearbox input shaft on a first shaft line I . A change speed gear is provided between the first shaft line and a second shaft line II , both shaft lines lying in the parting plane. On the same, output shaft line II are disposed the half shafts connected to wheels of the vehicle with a split differential between the gearbox output shaft and the half shafts. A clutch 314 and spur gears 388, 389 at the front of the casing couple the engine shaft 312 to a power take off shaft 390 situated below the shaft lines I and II . The power take off shaft extends through a hollow front wheel drive shaft which is coupled to an output gear by a bevel gear 391 .
