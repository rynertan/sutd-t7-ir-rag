# EARTH WORKING TOOL HEAD

## Abstract
A head 18 for a powered earth working tool 12 is adapted to be driven by a rotating shaft 28 which is driven by the prime mover 14 of the tool. The head includes a housing 36 having an opening for the shaft a driver gear 48 in the housing fixed to the shaft which rotates with the shaft about an axis 70 an axle 52 in the housing disposed perpendicularly to such axis of rotation and carrying a driven gear 64 on a portion of the axle away from the ends to mesh with the driver gear and rotate the axle a pair of pins e.g., 76 , offset from the axis of the axle, mounted to move with the rotation of the axle, 180 out of phase with each other a pair of spindles 88, 102 the housing disposed substantially parallel to the axle a pair of connecting rods 86, 110 each having an opening e.g., 84 to receive one of the pins and being mounted to swing from one of the spindles about the axis of the spindle and a pair of earth working members 32 and 34 120 or 128 each fixed to one of the connecting rods to swing from the associated spin dle about the axis of the spindle in a pendulum like oscillation 180 out of phase with the other member. The head has wheels 112 for rolling support also, a roller 120 is adapted to fit over such wheels to provide an alternative form of rolling sup port. The members can take particular alternative forms for hoeing 32 and 34 , digging trenches 128 or cutting and lifting sod 120 . The trench digging form has a first elongated por tion 130 extending from the vicinity of the housing, a second
