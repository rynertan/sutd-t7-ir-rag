## Description
METHOD OF STABILIZING UROKINASE PRECURSOR AND DRY PREPARATION CONTAINING SAID PRECURSOR FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method of stabilizing a urokinase precursor and a dry preparation containing said precursor. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A urokinase precursor secreted from human kidney cells does not exhibit urokinase activity by itself.However, when digested with a proteinase, such as plasmin, the precursor is transformed into a molecule which shows a high urokinase activity. The urokinase precursor has a high affinity to fibrin and reaches the fibrin constituting a blood clot without acting on or decomposing fibrinogen in the blood plasma. Thereafter, the precursor exhibits the urokinase activity by the action of plasmin. That is, the urokinase precursor causes limited fibrin dissolution in the blood clot site and dissolves the blood clot selectively and efficiently. Therefore, the precursor is believed to be useful as a novel medicine for treatment of the dis e a se of thrombosis. The urokinae precursor is unstable in a highly purified condition, or dried or freeze dried condition, although it is relatively stable when stored in a neutral solvent in a high concentration during the processes of preliminary purification and final purification. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a method of stabilizing a urokinase precursor and also to a dry preparation containing a stabilized urokinase precursor. It has been found that a dried urokinase precursor is stabilized when a mixture of a at least one member of inorganic salts, organic acid salts, and polar amino acids and their salts, and b human albumin is added to the precursor. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of stabilizing a urokinase precursor by adding thereto a at least one member of inorganic salts, organic acid salts, and polar amino acids and their salts, and b alubmin. In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a dry preparation containing a stabilized urokinase precursor. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The urokinase precursor as used herein includes those precursors obtained from urine, human kidney cells, and by the genetic engineering see JP A 62981 1985 corresponding to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 06 648,134, for example . The effect of the present invention is particularly remarkable in a highly purified urokinase precursor, such as a urokinase precursor of a concentration that the specific activity is 100,000 IU mg protein. The symbol IU is an abbreviation of an international unit of UK. 1 IU ml, which is equivalent to the UK activity when 1 ml of the precursor is treated with plasmin, means that 1 ml of the precursor, when treated with plasmin, has the same activity as that of 1 IU of UK. Examples of the inorganic salts that are used in the present invention are alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts of halogen, and alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts of phosphoric acid. Preferred are sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, and calcium phosphate. As the organic acids, aliphatic carboxylic acids which may have a hydroxyl group are preferably used. The number of carboxyl groups is preferably 1 to 3 and the number of hydroxyl groups is preferably 0 to 3. Suitable examples of these organic acids are oxy acids such as citric acid, aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as oxalic acid, and fatty acids such as acetic acid and mandelic acid. Examples of the salts of the above organic acids are alkali metal e.g., sodium and potassium salts. Examples of the polar amino acids that are used in the present invention are glutamic acid, aspartic acid, arginine, lysine, and histidine. Suitable examples of the salts of the above polar amino acids are sodium glutamate and arginine chloride. Among the above substances which can be used as component a , organic acid salts and poler amino acids, more particularly arginine and sodium citrate, are preferred. The albumin as used herein is preferably albumin obtained from human in view of the problem of antigenicity. There are no special limitations to the albumin as long as it is purified for the purpose of use for medical treatment. The purity is preferred to be such that the albumin content as determined by electrophoresis is not less than 80 . Methods of obtaining human albumin include the ethanol fractionation method see JapanesePatent Publication Nos. 2869 72 and 5297 60 , and the method comprising heating in the presence of organic acids see Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 1604 68 and 40132 76 . It is particularly preferred to subject the albumin to heat treatment preferably at 600C for about 10 hours for inactivation of hepatitis virus, for example. Albumin is added in an amount corresponding to 10 to 60 mg, preferably 25 to 50 mg, and the inorganic salt, organic acid salt, or polar amino acid or its salt is added in an amount corresponding to 2 to 50 mg, preferably 5 to 30 mg, per 10,000 to 250,000 IU of the urokinase precursor. The stabilizers of the present invention, i.e., inorganic salts, organic acid salts, polar amino acids or their salts, are added with good results at any stage during the process that the urokinase precursor is placed under conditions where the precursor could be inactivated, such as the purification and storage of the urokinase precursor. The present invention is described in greater detail with reference to the following examples. The activity of the urokinase precursor was measured, after activation with plasmin, by the use of a synthetic substrate Glt Gly Arg MCA . EXPERIMENT 1 To a solution of a purified urokinase precursor specific activity 135,000 IU mg protein in a 0.10 M phosphate buffer pub 6.0 as a solvent was added a solution of albumin in the same buffer as above as a solvent to prepare 25,000 IU ml of an aqueous urokinase precursor solution containing 20 mg ml of human albumin.Various additives inorganic salts, organic acid salts, or polar amino acids or their salts were added to the above prepared aqueous urokinase precursor solution so that the total amount of the additives added was 8 mg ml and then freeze dried. For comparison, the aqueous urokinase precursor solution not containing any additive, and the aqueous urokinase precursor solution with only human albumin added thereto were freeze dried in the same manner as above. These compositions were measured for the remaining urokinase precursor titer just after its freeze drying and after storage at 500C for 3 months. The results are shown in Table 1.

EXAMPLE 1 25,000 IU of a purified urokinase precursor specific activity 135,000 IU mg protein , 20 mg of human albumin, and 6.4 mg of sodium citrate were dissolved in 1 ml of a 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH, 7.0 , aseptically filtered, charged in a vial bottle, and then freeze dried to prepare an injection preparation containing 25,000 units of urokinase precursor, 20 mg of human albumin and 6.4 mg of sodium citrate. EXAMPLE 2 A preparation containing 25,000 IU of urokinase precursor, 20 mg of human albumin and 6.4 mg of table salt NaCl was prepar ed in the same manner as in Example 1. EXAMPLE 3 50,000 IU of a purified urokinase precursor specific acitivity 135,000 IU mg protein , 40 mg of human albumin and 12.8 mg of sodium citrate were processed in the same manner as in Example 1 to prepare a preparation containing 50,000 IU of urokinase precursor, 40 mg of human albumin and 12.8 mg of sodium citrate. EXAMPLE 4 25,000 IU of a purified urokinase precursor specific activity 135,000 IU mg protein , 20 mg of human albumin, and 6.4 mg of arginine were dissolved in 1 ml of a 0.1M phosphate buffer pH, 7.0 , aseptically filtered, charged in a vial bottle, and then freeze dried to prepare a prepation containing 25,000 IU of urokinase precursor, 20 mg of human albumin and 6.4 mg of arginine. EXAMPLE 5 A preparation containing 25,000 IU of urokinase precursor, 20 mg of human albumin and 6.4 mg of sodium glutamate was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1. EXAMPLE 6 50,000 IU of a purified urokinase precursor specific activity 135,000 IU mg protein , 40 mg of human albumin and 12.8 mg of arginine were processed in the same manner as in Example 1 to prepare a preparation containing 50,000 IU of urokinase precursor, 40 mg of human albumin and 12.8 mg of arginine. SYNTHESIS EXAMPLE Cultivated human kidney cells were grown for 3 days in a 0.1 human serum albumin added non serum culture, and the fermentation broth thus obtained was subjected to centrifugal separation. The resulting supernatant was frozen and stored. The pooled supernatant was adjusted to pH 5.5 and contacted with CM Sephadex C50. After washing a column with a 0.16 M phosphate buffer pH 5.5 , the adsorbed urokinase precursor was eluted with a 0.16 M phosphate buffer pH, 8.5 . Among hybridomas prepared by fusion using polyethylene glycol of spleen cells of BALB c mouse which had been immunized with the urokinase precursor and mouse myeloma cells, a clone having a high productivity of antibody for the urokinase precursor was selected. From this fermentation broth of the fused cells, an antiurokinase monoclonal antibody was recovered. This monoclonal antibody was immobilized on BrCN activatedSepharose 4B produced by Pharmacia Co., Ltd. This monoclonal antibody column was equilibrated with a 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH, 7.0 containing 0.4 MNaCl, and then contacted with the eluate containing urokinase precursor.After washing the column with a 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH, 7.0 containing 0.4 M NaCl, the adsorbed urokinase precursor was eluted with a 0.2 M aqueous glycine HCl solution pH 2.5 containing 0.5 M Nazi. The eluate was neutralized and then was passed through a carrier fixed anti mouse IgG rabbit IgG and was removed a very small amount of exuded mouse IgG. The solution thus passed was freed from bacteria and filtered, and then freeze dried to obtain a highly purified urokinase precursor having a specific activity of at least 80,000 IU mg. This purified product, when measured with SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, showed one band ascribable to a molecular weight of 50,000. While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiment thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
