## Description
The present invention. relates to a coupled panels reflecting assembly or structure, effective to define a high concentration zone of the sun rays, for tanning and therapeutical purposes, and also effective to operate as a wind screen or shield. As it is well known, there are presently commercially available such structures,of reduced size,which are provided with a reflecting surface and are used, in sunny environments, to favour the tanning of the user face. The mentioned structures generally consist of a suitable strenght sheet member, which is divided into sectors adjoining one another by means of folding lines affording the possibility of folding one sector with respect to the others in such a way as to provide a number of dihedral configurations. A proper use of the mentioned reflecting structures or assemblies, on the other hand, compels the user to hold said structures, with suitable angles,near his her face, in order to concentrate thereon the sun rays. Thus both hands of the user are engaged and, in addition, has to remain motionless for long time periods with consequent fatiguing of the body muscles. Moreover the thereinabove mentioned reflecting structures of conventional type, in addition to being effective only on a small portion of the user body, in actual practice the face whereof, and,possibly the upper portion of the trunk, may be used only for tanning purposes. Accordingly, the task of the present invention is to overcome the thereinabove mentioned drawbacks of the known reflecting structures by providing such a reflecting assembly, effective to speed up tanning,which is self bearing,while having such constructional characteristics as to afford the possibility of operating also as a wind screen or shield. Within that task, it is a main object of the present invention to provide such a reflecting assembly, effective to speed up tanning,which is effective to positively affect all of the user body parts. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such a reflecting structure, effective to speed up tanning, which may be used both in windy beaches and closed rooms,near windows and the like,thereby affording the possibility of obtaining the desired tanning also in feeble sun conditions. According to one aspect of the present invention,the thereinabove mentioned task and objects, as well as yet other objects which will become more apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a reflecting assembly or structure,effective to speed up tanning, characterized in that it comprises a plurality of substantially rectangular elongated pancls,said panels being hinge coupled to one another and effective to be folded as the pages of a book, and being provided with reflecting adjoining surfaces. Further characteristics and advantages of the reflecting structure or assembly according to the present invention will become more apparent hereinafter from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment thereof, being illustrated by way of a not limitative example in the figures of the accompanying drawing,where fig.l schematically illustrates the reflecting structure or assembly according to the invention,as arranged in circle arc configuration near a deck chair and fig.2 represents that same reflecting structure in a folded condition. With reference to the figures of the accompanying drawings, the reflecting and wind shielding assembly or structure, effective to speedup tanning and protecting against the wind, according to the present invention,comprises a plurality of panels l,of elongated rectangular shape,which are coupled to one another in the length direction by known hinge means effective to allow for said panels to be arranged in an adjoining relationship, like a bellows. Thus the reflecting structure presents, in a folded condition and as it is shown in figure 2,very reduced size,thereby facilitating the transportation thereof. The mentioned panels may be obtained starting from thin layers or plates of several suitable materials,provided that they are sufficiently rigid,or even by conveniently framing soft materials. Moreover said panels are made reflective at one surface 1 thereof by means of known surface treatings,such as silvering,plating metalizing and the like,thereby providing said surfaces with a high reflecting power. Thus, by conveniently arranging, depending on the particular requirements, the plurality of reflecting panels as it is shown for example in fig.l ,it will be possible to provide a zone 2, protected against wind,thereat the sun rays are concentrated in the desired amount. Moreover,at the outer edgesof the two end panels there may be provided anchoring members not specifically shown ,effective to couple the reflecting structure to fixed means,if it is deemed necessary. From the above disclosure and the figures of the accompanying drawings the great functionality and use facility characterizing the reflecting assembly or structure according to the present invention will be self evident. In practicing the invention the used materials,as well as the contingent shape and size may be any according to requirements.
