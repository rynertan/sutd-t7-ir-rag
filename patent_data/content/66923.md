# AIRCRAFT STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY ASSESSMENT SYSTEM

## Abstract
A system is provided for collecting and interpreting data indicative of the effect of at least one of the plurality of forces acting on an aircraft or helicopter structure 112 . The system comprises one or more structural moment detectors 111 , and electronic cir cuitry 114 for processing and manipulating signals derived from the detector or detectors 111 in such a manner as to produce secondary signals indicative of the effect being monitored. In one embodiment, the electronic circuity associated with each structural mo ment detector 111 is provided in the same housing as the detector to form a unitary device termed a structural information detector.
