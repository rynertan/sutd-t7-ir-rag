## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF PYRIDAZINE DERIVATIVES This invention concerns an improved process for the preparation of pyridazine derivatives, namely esters of l aryl 1,4 dihydro 4 oxopyridazine 3 carboxylic acids. The preparation of l aryl 1,4 dihydro 4 oxo pyridazine 3 carb√≥xylic acids via the rearrangement of a hydra zone in hot aqueous mineral acids or hot aqueous base is disclosed in Belgian Patent 864,704. These methods are additionally disclosed in British PatentSpecification 762,141 in United States Patent 2,835,671, in Helvetica Chimica Acta, 39, 1741 1956 , in theJournal of the American Chemical Society JACS , 78, 624 1955 and in JACS, 70, 2253 1948 . That l aryl 1,4 dihydro 4 oxypyridazine carboxylic acids can be esterified via Fischer esterification is disclosed in Helvetica Chimica Acta, 39, 1741 1956 andUnited States Patent 2,835,671. The Fischer esterification method requires the isolation of the carboxylic acid prior to the esterification reaction.Fischer esterification reactions generally produce a crude product that is highly colored and rather impure.Several recrystallizations are often required to obtain material of adequate purity for analysis and testing.Fischer esterification generally requires several hours to several days before completion and gives low yields. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of a l aryl l, 4 dihydro 4 oxopyridazine carboxylic acid ester of the formula EMI1.1 which comprises reacting, in a liquid medium and in the substantial absence of water available to undergo reaction to form undesired by product s , an alcohol with a hydrazone in the presence of a a strong acid catalyst and b a desiccant which serves to remove water of reaction, wherein the alcohol is of the formula ROH II and the hydrazone is of the formula EMI2.1 where in the above formulae R is Cl C6 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy C1 C4 alkyl, C3 C8 cycloalkyl, C3 C8 cycloalkyl Cl C4 alkyl, halo C1 C6 alkyl, benzyl or benzyl the ring of which is substituted with up to two of the same or different substituents selected from chloro, bromo, methyl, ethyl, methoxy, cyano, nitro and trifluoromethyl R1 and R2 are selected from hydrogen and Cl C4 alkyl X is selected from halo, trihalomethyl, nitro, C1 C4 alyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, C1 C4 alkylthio, C1 C4 alkylsulfinyl, C1 C4 alkylsulfonyl, cyano and carboxy, the X substituents being the same or different when n is 1 and n is O or an integer of from 1 3.The esters of Formula I are useful as plant growth regulants and in particular as chemical hybridization agents. The reaction between the alcohol and the hydrazone is generally conducted at a temperature from 250C to 1500C, preferably 400C to 120 0C and even more preferably 600C to 110 0C and is also generally conducted in the presence of an inert solvent. Usually at least one mole of the alcohol ROH will be used per mole of the hydrazone of Formula III. The desiccant, which is used in at least an amount sufficient to remove water of reaction, may be a tri C1 C4 alkylorthoformate, a tri Cl C4 alkyl borate, a tetra C1 C4 alkyl silicate, a Cl C4 alkyl acetal, a Cl C4 alkyl ketal, a molecular sieve or phosphorus pentoxide. The most preferred desiccant is a C1 C4 alkylorthoformate. The strong acid, which is used in a catalytic amount, may be sulfuric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, perchloric, phosphoric, trifluoromethylacetic and methane sulfonic acid. If transesterification is to be avoided, the alcohol chosen as the reactant ROH will be the same as that liberated by the tri Cl C4 alkylorthoformate in acting as desiccant and the same as any alcohol used as a solvent. The term alkyl as used in this specification is meant to include both branched and straight chain alkyl groups also by the use of an unqualified term such as butyl, it is meant to include all the various isomers.The term halo means fluoro,chloro, bromo or iodo. Typical alcohols of Formula II that can be utilized in the process of the invention include methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n propanol, n butanol, sec butanol, tert butanol, n pentanol, n hexanol, methoxymethanol, cyclohexanol, cyclohexylmethanol, chloromethanol, benzyl alcohol and chlorobenzyl alcohol. Typical desiccants that can be used include trimethylorthoformate, triethylorthoformate, triisopropylorthoformate, tri n butylorthoformate, trimetbylborate, triethylborate, tetramethylsilicate, tetraethylsilicate, acetaldehyde dimethyl acetal, acetone dimethyl ketal, Linde Type 4 A molecular sieves and phosphorus pentoxide. Typical inert solvents that can be utilized in the process of this invention include halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene dichloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and chlorobenzene and arpmatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and xylene. A preferred process of this invention comprises using a hydrazone of Formula III where R1and R2 are hydrogen, methyl and ethyl, and X is fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoromethyl, nitro, methyl, methoxy, methylthio, methylsulfonyl or methylsulfinyl. In this preferred process, there is used an alcohol ofFormula II wherein R is methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, cyclohexyl or benzyl and there is used a desiccant which is trimethylorthoformate, triethylorthoformate, triisopropylorthoformate, tri n butlyorthoformate, trimethyl borate, triethyl borate, tetramethyl silicate, tetraethyl silicate, acetaldehyde dimethyl acetal, acetone dimethyl ketal, a Linde Type 4 A molecular sieve, or phosphorus pentoxide.In this preferred process the desiccant is selected in such a manner that any alcohol produced in the dehydrating process is the same as the alcohol utilized as the reagent ROH in the process. Finally, in this preferred process, there is used a catalytic amount of a strong acid which is sulfuric, hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid, and there is used an excess amount of the alcohol utilized as the reagent ROH as the reaction solvent and a temperature 400C to 1200C. Another feature of this invention comprises the additional step of cooling the resultant reaction mixture, adding it to water and extracting the desired product with an appropriate solvent.Appropriate solvents which can be utilized in this extraction procedure include methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, toluene, xylene and diethylether. The isolated ester can, if desired, be treated with a dilute aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide to form the sodium or potassium salt of the respective oxopyridazine 3 carboxylic acid. A particularly preferred process of this invention comprises reacting a hydrazone of Formula I as defined above, with an alcohol of Formula II as defined above in the prescence of a tri C1 C4 alkylorthoformate having the same alkyl substituent as the alkyl group of the alcohol ROH used in the reaction. In this process, it is also particularly preferred to use a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid and a temperature from 600C to 1100C. The desiccants utilized in this invention are either commercially available or can be readily prepared. For example, trimethylorthoformate and triethylorthoformate are commercially available products. Other trialkylorthoformates can be readily prepared in situ from these products by transesterification with the desired alcohol prior to the addition of the hydrazone. The following examples are presented to illustrate the process of the present invention. In the examples, percentages are on a weight basis unless otherwise indicated and degrees are degrees Celsius.
