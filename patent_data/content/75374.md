# Ground plane antenna.

## Abstract
A ground plane antenna comprises a quaterwave reso nant radiating rod 1 made of a hollow tube in which a central earthing rod 7 is arranged to form with the internal cylindrical wall of the radiating rod a line section short circuited at the upper end. A further line section 16 open at the lower end is arranged in the extension of the short circuited line section to form a combined tapped line section therewith having an elec trical length substantially equal to the quarterwavelength, in which the combined line section is coupled with its tapping points in parallel to the input terminals 4, 5 of the antenna, whereby the susceptance represented by the combined line section is capable of compensating the changes of the anten na reactance within a fairly wide band.
