# Fuel vaporization device for an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A fuel vaporization device is provided wherein at omized liquid fuel is injected in timed sequence directly into a separate vacuum chamber C or the chamber of a rolling piston vacuum pump P . Optionally, minute amounts of air are bled into the vacuum chamber as the liquid fuel droplets are injected resulting in substantially complete and imm ediate vaporization of the fuel which is fed as gaseous fuel from the vacuum pump to the intake manifold 78 of an internal combustion engine. A coolant jacket 102 sur rounds the pump and chamber where separate for cir culating heated liquid coolant from the engine in heat ex change relationship with the fuel.
