# Thermal printer.

## Abstract
The present invention is equiped with a plurality of print buffers 27, 28 for inputting print data into a thermal head 10 , wherein such print data are selectively fed to simply change the current on time for energizing the heating elements 35 of the thermal head relative to specific information 17 out of the entire information to be printed, thereby partially altering the colour forming degree on the recording paper to definitely distinguish the emphatic label portion from any other portion, and the current on time for energizing the heating elements is shortened for any print line having none of the particular colour print data, hence reducing the required print time.
