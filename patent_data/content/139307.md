# Multi axis load sensor.

## Abstract
A multi axis load sensor comprises at least one radial plate structure 50 75 adapted to detect a moment to be produced about its standard axis by a load, and at least one of a parallel plate structure 51 74 adapted to detect a force to be produced in the direction of its standard axis by the load and another radial plate structure 50 75 adapted to detect a moment to be produced about its standard axis by the load. The standard axis of the former radial plate structure is neither coincident with nor parallel to the standard axis of the at least one of the parallel plate structure and latter radial plate structure. The above sensor can reduce interactions of detected signals to extremely low levels, while showing good detection sensitivity and large strength and rigidity and making detection characteristic linear.
