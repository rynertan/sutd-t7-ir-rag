## Description
AMPLIFIED EXPRESSION OF DNASEQUENCES TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the amplified expression of DNA sequences and to the improved production of amino acids, polypeptides and proteins coded for by thoseDNA sequences. More particularly, the invention relates to a process which amplifies the expression of multi copy plasmid carried DNA sequences and improves the synthesis of multicopy plasmid coded amino acids, polypeptides and proteins, affording high yields of those products, low contamination of those products by non plasmid coded products and ease of fermentation culture monitoring, handling and purification. The process of this invention is particularly useful in large scale fermentation processes where it affords the production of substantially higher yield of product per unit volume of culture than conventional processes. BACKGROUND ART Recent advances in molecular biology have made it possible to introduce the DNA coding for specific non bacterial amino acids, polypeptides and proteins into a variety of host cells. In general, the DNA coding for the desired amino acid, polypeptide or protein product is introduced into an appropriate site in a cloning vehicle to form a recombinant DNA molecule. That molecule is then used to transform a compatible host and the host cultured to express the inserted DNA sequence and to produce the product coded for by that DNA sequence. Several non bacterial proteins have been produced in bacterial hosts using such recombinant DNA technology. These include, for example, leukocyte interferon S.

Kipper et al., Cloning Of cDNA Of MajorAntigen Of Foot And Mouth Disease Virus And Expression InE. coli , Nature, 289, pp. 555 59 1981 . The level of production of a product in such host cells is governed by three major factors the number of copies of the DNA sequence that codes four the product within the cell, the efficiency with which thoseDNA sequences are transcribed and the efficiency with which the resultant messenger RNA mRNA is translated.Efficiency of transcription and translation which together comprise expression is in turn dependent upon the nucleotide sequences which are normally situated ahead of the sequences coding for the desired products. These nucleotide sequences or expression control sequences define, inter alia, the location at which RNA polymerase interacts the promoter sequence to initiate transcription and at which ribosomes bind and interact with the mRNA the product of transcription to initiate translation to the desired product. A variety of expression control sequences are now available to improve the efficiency of expression transcription and translation of cloned DNA sequences.These expression control sequences are of two main types constitutive expression control sequences and controllable expression control sequences. Constitutive expression control sequences, i.e., ss lac, lac WS or tet, continuously function during host cell growth to express the cloned DNA sequence and to produce the product coded for by that DNA sequence. Controllable expression control sequences, i.e., trp, APL, or APR, may be regulated, i.e., switched on or off, during host cell growth so that expression of the cloned DNA sequence may be switched on at the most appropriate time in a culture s growth cycle. Both types of expression control sequences have been used in processes to permit the expression of multicopy plasmid carried DNA sequences and the production of products coded for by those sequences. The particular process employed depends in large measure on the type of expression control sequence. For constitutive expression control sequences, a culture of host cells transformed with the multicopy plasmid carried DNA sequence coding for the desired product is grown in appropriate media and under appropriate conditions until the exponential growth phase has been substantially completed. The cells are then harvested and the desired product recovered and purified using well known processes.Most often in large scale cultures, i.e. from 100 ml to many thousands of liters, an overnight culture of the transformed host is first prepared and that culture is then used to inoculate about a 100 times larger volume of culture media. The larger volume culture then undergoes a lag phase when the cells are readjusting to growth conditions and culture environment of about 2 h before exponential cell growth begins. Again, however, the culture is harvested after the exponential growth phase is substantially completed and the desired product recovered and purified. This process is beset by several disadvantages.First, the method is slow. Often 7 20 h of cell growth and careful monitoring of cell density are required befdre harvesting can begin. In addition, the amount of the desired product per unit of culture volume is usually relatively low because the host cell also produces all of the other products coded for by its plasmid and chromosomalDNAs. Finally, recovery and purification of the desired product is often difficult and expensive because of its low yield necessitating the culturing and handling of large culture volumes to recover useful amounts and because of its contamination with so many other similar proteins and related products. For controllable expression control sequences, a culture of host cells transformed with the multicopy plasmid carried DNA sequence coding for the desired product is grown in media and under conditions where the expression control sequence is switched off . During growth the concentration of cells is monitored, usually by the optical density of the culture. When the density reaches a pre determined point usually about the mid point of the exponential growth phase , the expression control sequence is switched on by addition of an activating substance like tryptophan or by a temperature shift. The culture of host cells now expressing the inserted DNA sequence is then grown to stationary phase before harvesting and subsequent recovery and purification of the desired product. Again, in large scale cultures, an overnight culture is employed as an inoculuum for about a 100 times larger volume culture. Again, the culture undergoes a lag phase of several hours before exponential growth begins and the cell density approaches the point chosen for activation and continued growth before harvesting. This culture method is also beset by several disadvantages. Again, the method is slow. Often 6 10 h are required before harvesting can begin. The method also requires careful monitoring of the cell density and rapid activation of the culture at the appropriate density to switch on expression of the inserted DNA sequence.In addition, while the relative amount of desired product synthesized by the cell after switch on is generally high as compared to the amounts of other products being made at that time by the cell, the total amount of desired product per unit of culture volume is still relatively low because the host cell produces the products coded for by its chromosomal DNA before switch on, since those are not under the control of the regulated expression control sequence, and because after switch on the host cell continues to produce the products coded for by its chromosomal DNA and also produces any other proteins coded for by the plasmid DNA that are under the control of the switched on expression control sequence.Finally, recovery and purification of the desired protein are difficult and expensive because of its relatively low yield necessitating the culturing and handling of large culture volumes to recover useful amounts and because of its contamination with other similar proteins and related products. A variety of means to increase the number of copies per cell of a DNA sequence coding for a desired product is also available. The most usual means is to use a multicopy plasmid for cloning the DNA sequence coding for a desired product. When such multicopy plasmid is transformed into a host cell, it replicates in the cell so that each cell contains 20 50 copies of the plasmid. Accordingly, each cell also contains 20 50 copies of the DNA sequence that codes for the desired product since that sequence is carried on the plasmid. The extra copies of the DNA sequence are thus available for expression and production of the desired product and accordingly afford a higher yield of that product per cell. Other techniques have allowed the copy number of a multicopy plasmid to be increased well beyond the usual 20 50 copies per cell. These techniques include, for example, treatment of cells transformed with a multicopy plasmid carried DNA sequence coding for a desired product with chloramphenicol and growing of cells transformed with a multicopy plasmid carried DNA sequence coding for a desired product under conditions of amino acid starvation. Chloramphenicol treatment of cells and growth of cells under conditions of amino acid starvation affect the ability of the cells to make proteins. While the lack of some of these proteins prevents replication of the cell and its chromosomal DNA, their absence does not initially prevent the continued replication of plasmidcarried DNA. Accordingly, the number of copies per cell of the multicopy plasmid carried DNA increases. For example, after chloramphenicol treatment it has been estimated that the host cell may contain up to about 2000 copies of the plasmid and stationary phase cultures a condition of amino acid starvation have been estimated to contain about 400 500 copies per cell of the plasmid. However, chloramphenicol treatment, as described by F. G. Neidhardt et al., Selective Synthesis Of PlasmidCoded Proteins By Escherichia coli During Recovery FromChloramphenicol Treatment , J. Bacteriol., 143, pp. 535 37 1980 , is very cumbersome a culture in the exponential growth phase must be treated with chloramphenicol overnight, the cells collected by centrifugation, the chloramphenicol washed out and the cells resuspended in media. Accordingly, it has only been employed with very small scale 5 ml cultures where collecting the cells, washing them and resuspending them is not a difficult procedure Neidhardt et al., supra .The method has, in fact, more usually been employed to produce large numbers of plasmids and quantities of plasmid carried DNA for isolation and analysis since less cumbersome collecting of cells, washing and resuspension is required to recover the amplified plasmids. Amino acid starvation has also been occasionally employed to permit the recovery of large amounts of plasmid coded DNA. However, it has not been used as a means for increasing the production or yield of products coded for by plasmid carried DNA sequences. In fact, conventional fermentation processes serve to dissipate any high copy number of plasmid carried DNA of a stationary phase culture by first diluting the culture into a larger media volume and then allowing growth to proceed through the exponential phase at which time the copy number is back to its original level 20 to 50 copies per cell before harvesting. Therefore, the promise of recombinant DNA technology to produce useful amounts of various products has been delayed by the disadvantages inherent in the various techniques presently available to express plasmidcarried DNA sequences and to produce the products coded for by those sequences. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally solves the problems referred to above by providing a method to amplify the expression of multicopy plasmid carried DNA sequences and to increase the production of amino acids, polypeptides and proteins coded for by those DNA sequences.More particularly, the process of this invention improves the synthesis of products coded for by multicopy plasmidcarried DNA sequences affording high yields of the products, low contamination of the products by products of nonplasmid carried DNA sequences and ease of culture monitoring, handling and purification. As will be appreciated from the disclosure to follow the process of this invention comprises the steps of increasing the copy number per cell of a multicopy plasmid carried DNA sequence coding for a desired product combining culture media or other nutrients with a culture of said increased copy number cells, the volume of the culture media being preferably between 0.05 to 10 times the volume of the culture and most preferably between 0.05 and 0.2 times that volume culturing the resultant culture under conditions appropriate for expression of the multicopy plasmid carried DNA sequence and harvesting the resulting culture before substantial exponential growth has occurred i.e. preferably about 2 3 h after the culture and media were combined.

BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION In order that the invention herein described may be more fully understood, the following detailed description is set forth. In this description the term host organism is used broadly. For example, it includes both gram negative and gram positive bacterial hosts such as strains of E. coli, e.g., E. coli HB101, E. coliX1776, E. coli X2882, E. coli DS410, E. coli C600, E. coliMRCI, E. coli It15219 and strains of Pseudomonas, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus steareothermophilus and other bacilli or yeasts and other fungi. Preferably, E. coli C600 is used. The selection of a particular host is not part of this invention. Rather, the invention is applicable generally to the amplified expression of multicopy plasmid carried DNA sequences which have been employed to transform those host organisms and to the production of the products coded for by those sequences in such hosts. In addition, the process of this invention is applicable to a wide variety of proteins, polypeptides, amino acids and other products. For example, products such as the active components of vaccines or other pharmaceutically active products, agriculturally or other commercially useful compositions, enzymes, amino acids, industrial chemicals, antibiotics, food stuffs, and the like are usefully produced by the process of this invention. Again, the selection of a particular product is not part of this invention. Rather, the invention is applicable generally to the amplified expression of multi copy plasmid carried DNA sequences coding for such products and to the production of such products in hosts transformed with those multicopy plasmid carried DNA sequences. Finally, the numerous techniques and processes for growing or fermenting cultures of host organisms or for the recovery or purification of products from them are not part of this invention. Rather, this invention is a useful complement to those techniques and improves the expression of multicopy plasmid carried DNA sequences and the production of desired products from them. It should, of course, be understood that not every host organism or every growth, recovery or purification technique may be usefully employed to produce a specific product in a particular host organism by the processes of this invention. Rather, those of skill in the art should consider various factors known in the art to select a preferred host and preferred conditions for the production and purification of a desired product. For example, a wide variety of host plasmidcloning vehicle combinations have been employed in recombinant DNA technology to prepare transformed host organisms that produce a desired foreign product. For example, useful multicopy plasmid cloning vehicles may consist of various known bacterial plasmids, e.g., multicopy plasmids from E. coli including pMB9, pBR325, pBR322 and their derivatives wider host range multicopy plasmids, and cloning vehicles derived from combinations of multicopy plasmids and phage DNAs such as plasmids which have been modified to employ phage DNA or other expression control sequences or multicopy yeast plasmids such as 2 plasmids or derivatives thereof.Various DNA sequences may be cloned in those multicopy plasmid cloning vehicles at well recognized sites in them to produce hybrid or recombinant DNA molecules. These molecules are useful, either as produced or after appropriate modification to improve their expression characteristics preferably to place the DNA sequence coding for a desired product under the control of a strong expression control sequence so that such DNA sequence will be expressed more effectively than other DNA sequences carried by the plasmid or to modify the product actually expressed from them, to transform host organisms, as described above, and to produce the products coded for by the inserted DNA sequences or portions thereof. Illustrative of the foreign products that have been produced by such transformed host organisms are hepatitis B viral antigens, foot and mouth disease viral antigens, leukocyte interferon, fibroblast interferon, the A and B chains of human insulin, rat growth hormone, mouse dihydrofolate reductase, somatostatin, human growth hormone and the like. Within the above general technology, the present invention is characterized by a simple and efficient process for amplifying the expression of multicopy plasmidcarried DNA sequences and for producing the amino acids, polypeptides and proteins coded for by those DNA sequences in improved yields and with less contamination by other proteins. The process is also characterized by ease of handling and culturing the host cell cultures that produce such products and by the ease of recovery and purifying such products from the culture. The process unexpectedly makes use of the lag phase in a culture s growth cycle to produce large amounts of the desired products while at the same time substantially avoiding the production of undesired products. The process comprises the steps of increasing the copy number per cell of a multicopy plasmid carriedDNA sequence encoding a desired product combining a culture medium with a culture of said increased copy number cells, culturing the resultant culture under conditions appropriate for expression of said DNA sequence and harvesting the resulting culture before substantial exponential cell growth occurs. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the unexpected and surprising amplified expression of multicopy plasmid carried DNA sequences and the improvement in the production of products coded for by those sequences results from the process of this invention because during lag phase the host cells are not replicating but rather adjusting to the new environmental conditions by preferential DNA and protein synthesis.Because few new cells are made, the copy number per cell of the plasmid carried DNA remains very high related to the amount of chromosomal DNA. Therefore, most of the products synthesized by the host cells during the lag phase are those products that are coded for by plasmidcarried DNA sequences. It is also believed that the unexpected results of the process of this invention are dependent on harvesting the culture before substantial exponential growth occurs, because the copy number per cell of the multicopy plasmid carried DNA sequences relative to chromsomal DNA is readjusted to the original level as exponential growth begins. Accordingly, the products synthesized by the cell during its exponential growth phase are a diverse mixture of chromosomal and plasmid coded products, with the latter being present in relatively small amount. Although any of the methods for increasing the copy number per cell of plasmid coded DNA sequences may be usefully employed as part of the novel process described herein, we prefer to increase the copy number per cell by growing a culture of cells that have been transformed with a multicopy plasmid carried DNA sequence coding for a desired product overnight and more preferably, in the particular case of strains of E coli, for 18 hours or more. This period of growth results in a dense stationary phase culture. It also results in an estimated copy number per cell of a plasmid carried DNA sequence of between about 400 and 500 for a multicopy plasmid like pBR322. Although conventional media may be used in preparing the above described stationary phase culture, very minimal media may also be used since only DNA synthesis, not protein synthesis, is required for the overnight culture. Moreover, the media employed may be usefully adjusted with various known additives that favor the DNA synthesis, e.g., glycerol and other carbon sources. In any case, however, the media should be buffered, for examples, by adding potassium phosphate, to avoid acidic conditions in the the stationary phase. The temperature and other conditions used to prepare the above described stationary phase culture should be those conventionally used to grow the host cells of the cultures.However, for those host cells that have been transformed with multi copy plasmid carried DNA sequences under the control of controllable expression control sequences, the growth conditions are preferably ones that limit or avoid expression of that DNA sequence. For example, transformed cells which are activated to expression by a temperature shift from 280 300C to 420 440C should be grown at 280 300C to prepare the stationary phase culture. After preparation of the high copy number culture, it is combined in accordance with the process of this invention with a volume of culture media. Although the ratio of the volume of the culture to the volume of the culture media may vary widely, enough media must be added to assure regrowth of the cells to exponential phase. It is therefore preferable to strike a balance between the desire to use as little media as possible to reduce the costs of the process and the size of the equipment necessary to handle, to treat and to purify large culture volumes and the need to use enough media to allow the cells to grow and to carry out protein synthesis.Which this selection depends to some extent as the host, usually, the volume of the added culture media is 0.05 to 10 times the volume of the culture and more preferably 0.05 to 0.2 times that volume are employed. It should of course be understood that while we have described this step in our process as the combination of a culture with a culture media, the culture media could equally well be added to the culture. In large scale fermentation, that latter method is preferably chosen. The media used for the large volume culture may be conventional media useful for the growth of the host cell organism. Preferably, the media may also be enriched with amino acids since optional protein synthesis is aimed for in the resulting culture. The temperature and other conditions of the culture and growth should be those conventionally used to grow the host cell of the culture. However, for those host cells that have been transformed with plasmid carried DNA sequences under the control of dontrollable expression control sequences, the conditions of the media before combination with the culture should be ones that activate the expression of the DNA sequence.For example, cells which are activated to expression by a temperature shift from 280 300C to 420 440C should be combined with a culture media already at 420 440C, because immediate expression of those DNA sequences is preferable. Such technique, of course, also avoids the need to monitor the growth of the culture and to shift rapidly the growth conditions of a growing culture for switch on of expression as is required in conventional fermentation of hosts containing DNA sequences under the control of controllable expression control sequences. The time the diluted culture is permitted to grow before harvesting may also vary widely according to the particular host, plasmid, conditions and media. It is only necessary to maximize the advantages of this invention that the cells be harvested at a time when they have produced a relatively large amount of the desired product as compared to the other cellular products.Preferably, the cells are harvested before substantial exponential growth has occurred and, more preferably, in the particular case of E. coli strains, after about 3 h of growth. In order that this invention may be more fully understood, the following examples of the process of this invention are set forth. These examples are for purposes of illustration only and this invention should not be considered to be limited by any recitation used herein. Example 1 Example 1 is a comparison of the expression of a plasmid carried DNA sequence coding for a polypeptide displaying the antigenicity of the VP1 protein of foot and mouth disease virus type O1K and the production of that polypeptide using a conventional process and using one embodiment of the process of this invention. In this example, plasmid pPL VP1 was constructed from plasmid pPLc24 and plasmid pFMDV 1034 as described in Kipper et al., supra. The plasmid has a DNA sequence coding for a polypeptide displaying the antigenicity of the VPl protein of FMDV, type O1K, inserted in it under the control of the PL controllable expression control sequence Figure 1 . This expression control sequence is switched off at about 280C and switched on at about 430C. Plasmid pPL VP1 was used to transform E. coli M5219 K12 M72 lac trp SmR AcI857 AHIbio252 H. Greer, TheKil Gene Of Bacteriophage A , Virology, 66, pp. 589 604 1975 . An overnight culture of E. coli M5219, transformed with plasmid pPL VPlr was prepared in L Broth containing 40 pg ml ampicillin the transformed host is resistant to ampicillin Figure 1 at 280C. Four ml of the above described overnight culture were added to 400 ml L Broth 1 100 dilution and the culture allowed to grow at 280C, the Or650 being monitored during culture growth. When the OD650 0.9 3.5 h , the temperature of the culture was raised to 430C. After 3 h at 430C the culture was harvested by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min Figure 2 . The resulting pellet was taken up in 10 ml 1 x PBS phosphate buffered saline and aliquots removed for analysis. Urea to 5 M and SDS to 1 were added to each aliquot. The resulting aliquot solutions were boiled for 5 min and the supernatants recovered by centrifugation for 20 min at 15000 rpm.The amount of polypeptide displaying the antigenicity of VP1 in the supernatant of each aliquot was determined bySDS gel electrophoresis and complement fixation assay. One hundred ml of the above described overnight culture were also added to 400 ml of L Broth preheated to 430C 1 4 dilution and the culture allowed to grow at 430C for 3 h Figure 3 . The cells were harvested and the supernatant removed and analyzed as before. The results of the two processes are described below Conventional Process of this Process InventionTime h 6.5 3Desired protein mg l 3 6 15 30 estimated by gel electrophoresis Desired protein mg l 3 6 15 30 estimated by complement fixation assay Therefore, using this embodiment of the process of this invention affords 3 to 8 times higher yields per unit volume of the desired product. Moreover, it is plain that because of these higher yields the purification and recovery of the desired product is much easier and more efficient since 3 to 8 times less culture volume must be used and processed and 3 to 8 times less impurities must be removed to isolate the same amount of product. In addition, where, as here, multicopy plasmid carriedDNA sequences under the control of controllable expression control sequences are employed, the culture need not be monitored and then quickly shifted during growth to switch on the expression of the desired DNA sequence. EXAMPLE 2 Example 2 is a comparison of the expression of the DNA sequence of pPL VP1 and the production of aVPl related product in another host using a conventional process and the process of this invention. Plasmid pPL VP1, described above and depicted in Figure 1, was employed to transform E. coli C600 pits 857 a C600 strain carrying the repressor on a plasmid . An overnight culture of this transformed host was prepared at 280C. As before 4 ml of the overnight culture were added to 400 ml L Broth 1 100 dilution and the culture allowed to grow at 280C, the OD650 being monitored during culture growth. When the OD650 0.9 3.5 h , the temperature of the culture was raised to 43 C. After 3 h at 430C the culture was harvested as before and the supernatant recovered and analyzed as before. In addition, 100 ml of the overnight culture were added to 400 ml L Broth 1 4 dilution , preheated to 430C, and the culture allowed to grow for 3 h. After harvesting and recovery, as before, the supernatant was analyzed for polypeptides displaying the antigenicity ofVP1. The results of the two process are described below Conventional Process of this Process InventionTime h 6.5 3Desired protein mg l 6 12 30 60 estimated by gel electrophoresis Conventional Process of this Process InventionDesired protein mg l 6 12 30 60 estimated by complement fixation assay Therefore, using this embodiment of the process of this invention with a different host strain that had been transformed with pPL VP1 afforded similarly improved results as compared to conventional processes 3 to 8 times higher yield per unit volume of desired product . EXAMPLE 3 Example 3 is another fermentation using the process of this invention for the expression of the DNA sequence of pPL VP1 and the production of a VPl related product in E. coli C600 pCIts857 . Plasmid pPL VP1, described above and depicted in Figure 1, was employed to transform E. coli C600 pCIts857 as in Example 2. An overnight culture of this transformed host was prepared at 280C. To prepare an inoculum 0.1 ml of that culture were added to 5 ml L broth, supplemented with kanamycin 30 pg ml and ampicillin 40 pg ml , and the culture grown overnight at 300C. 0.1 ml of this culture were then added to 10 ml L broth, supplemented as before, and grown for 8 h at 300C. 100 ml of L broth, supplemented as before, were then added and growth continued overnight at 30 C. 100 ml of the above described overnight culture were added to 900 ml culture medium, containing K2HPO4 4 g l , KH2PO4 1 g l , NH4C1 1 g l , CaCl2 6H2O 0.01 g l , K2SO4 2.6 g l , lM NgCl2 2 ml l , trace elements 10 ml l , casamino acids 20 g l , yeast extract 3 g l , 87 glycerol 46 g l , ampicillin 40 g 1 and kanamycin 30 pg l , that had been presterilized at 1210C for 15 min. The culture was grown at 300C for 24 h ph 7 controlled by 25 NH4OH and 25 H3PO4 , 2 30 After 24 h the O.D.650 was about 33. The temperature of the culture was then raised to 420C and 100 ml of medium, containing 22 g casamino acids, 3.3 g yeast extract and 25.3 g 87 glycerol and sterilized as before, were added 1 0.1 dilution . The culture was held at 420C for 2 h pH control as before, O.D.850 42.4 and harvested. After recovery, as before, the supernatant was analyzed for polypeptides displaying the antigenicity of VP1 20 of total cell proteins about 1600 mg l estimated by gel electrophoresis . Therefore, using this embodiment of the process of this invention dilution 1 0.1 afforded 125 to 250 times the yield per unit volume of conventional processes. EXAMPLE 4 Example 4 is a comparison of the expression of a plasmid carried DNA sequence coding for a polypeptide displaying the antigenicity of hepatitis B virus core antigen HBcAg and the production of that polypeptide using a conventional process and using the process of this invention. In this example, plasmid pHBc R ll was employed.Plasmid pHBc R ll Figure 4 contains the DNA sequence coding for a 140 amino acid containing polypeptide that displays the antigenicity of hepatitis B virus core antigen. As shown in Figure 4 the EBcAg related DNA sequence in pHbc R ll is under the control of a constitutive expression control sequence Lac UV5. Plasmid pHBc R ll was employed to transform E. coliHB101. An overnight culture of E. coli HB101 pHBc R ll was prepared in L Broth containing 40 pg ml ampicillin the transformed host is resistant to ampicillin Figure 4 at 370C. Four ml of the above described overnight culture were added to 400 ml L Broth 1 100 dilution and the culture allowed to grow at 370C until the end of the exponential growth phase 6 7 h Figure 5 . The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min.The pellet was redissolved in 10 ml 1 x PBS and aliquots of that solution selected and NP40 added to 0.5 . The aliquots were sonicated 3 times for 1 min and centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min. The amount of product displaying the antigenicity of HBcAg in each aliquot was then determined by complement fixation assay. One hundred ml of the overnight culture were also added to 400 ml of L Broth at 370C 1 4 dilution .The culture was grown for 3 h at 370C Figure 6 and the cells harvested as before. Aliquots prepared as before were then analyzed for the amount of product displayingHBcAg antigenicity. The results of the two process are described below Conventional Process of this Process InventionTime h 6 7 3Desired protein mg l 1 2 8 16 estimated by complement fixation assay Therefore, using this embodiment of the process of this invention afforded about 8 times higher yields per unit volume of the desired product. Moreover, it is plain that because of these higher yields the purification and recovery of the desired product is much easier and more efficient since 8 times less culture volume must be used and processed and 8 times less impurities must be removed to isolate the same amount of product. While we have hereinbefore presented a number of embodiments of this invention, it is apparent that our basic process may be altered to provide other embodiments which utilize it. Therefore, it will be appreciated that the scope of this invention is to be defined by the claims appended hereto rather than the specific embodiments which have been presented hereinbefore by way of example.
