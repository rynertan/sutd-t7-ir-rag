# Reel.

## Abstract
A generally circular reel body 10 is composed of two side parts 11, each of which has a flange 21 on its outer periphery. The flanges 21 extend away from each other in opposite directions from the body 10 and together form a guide track along which a carrying handle 22 is slidable, the handle containing grooves 24 in which the flanges 21 are respectively received. A low friction material, preferably in the form of one or more inserts, is provided between the flanges 21 and the grooves 24.
