## Description
The present invention relates to liquid compositions that are suited a hydraulic fluids for the transmission of power, particularly as hydraulic brake fluids, and which may contain boron, and consist of mixtures of glycols, glycolethers of various molecular weights and, optionally, boric glycolesters. The braking systems of motor vehicles represent an important safety element, and the efficient performance of the brakes is, to a large extent, determined by the characteristics of the hydraulic fluids used in said braking systems. Therefore. according to current regulations, said fluids have to meet very strict requirements as to e.g. boiling point, viscosity at hign and low temperatures, the pH value, the stability at low and high temperatures, corroding effect on metals and swelling action on rubbers. Among the requirements just mentioned, particularly decisive for the question of whether a fluid is suitable for use as a brake fluid or not are the boiling point at total reflux after humidification WET PERT and the viscosity at low temperatures. Said characteristics are closely related to the hygroscopicity of the fluids in question. In fact, it is known that the affinity for water not only manifests itself in the absorption of water from a humid gaseous surrounding atmosphere , but also in the strength of the intramolecular bonds which affect the value of the total reflux boiling temperature at atmospheric pressure PERT and the viscosity at low temperatures. The gradual absorption of moisture by the brake fluids, however this may occur, leads to a gradual lowering of the boiling point. This lowering of the boiling point makes the brake fluid less reliable for use in brakes, since modern motor vehicles develop a considerable amount of friction heat which may cause the boiling of the brake fluid, with a resulting formation of a vapor phase which impairs the compressibility of the fluid necessary for achieving the power transmission. Occurrence of such a phenomenon is unavoidable in the long run, whatever the fluid may be, and makes said fluid unsuitable for use. An effective remedy for this is the periodical change of the fluid for the braking system. However, since this is after all a not too simple ooeration, and at any rate a somewhat expensive one, it would be desirable, the principle of the periodical change of the braking fluid still remaining valid. to have available a brake fluid having the characteristic of reducing the harmful effect of the absorbtion of water, thereby proionging the period of operation under conditions of full suitability. The hydraulic brake fluids normally used must meet all FMVSS 116, DOT 3 and DOT 4 i.e. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard Department of Transportation and SAE J 1703 Society of Automotive Engineers N.Y. standards. The brake fluids belonging to the classes DOT 3 and DOT 4 have the following characteristics It is known from the patent and scientific literature of the last decades that almost all hydraulic brake fluids consist of a mixture of alcohols, glycols, glycolethers, polyglycols, polyglycolethers and derivatives thereof. For instance, FR A 2 158 523 describes liquid compositions for brakes belonging to the class DOT 4, consisting of mixtures of tetraethylene glycol, other glycols and lower glycolethers. Said compositions possess a WET PERT slightly greater than 155 C max. 156.5 C in Example 2 . and high viscosity values at low temperatures, due to the presence of tetraethylene glycol 1590 mm² s cSt at 40 C in Example 1 . It is quite obvious that a too high viscosity at low temperatures is an unfavourabie property for use in hydraulic brakes. Numerous studies were carried out in the attempt of obtaining brake fluids having always a high WET PERT, greater than 155 C, but being of a low viscosity at 40 C. not greater than 1500 mm² s cSt . Said liquids named DOT 3 DOT 4 have been found in the boric esters of the glycols, and more particularly in the products of the partial or total esterification with boric acid of one or more of the components of the traditional formulations based on alcohols, glycols, glycolethers, polyglycols and polyglycolethers. DE C 939045 discloses the use of boric esters of mono or polyvalent alcohols, alkanol amines or thiopolyglycols as additive for hydraulic fluids based on glycols. Said boric esters are used in amounts of 5 to 15 by weight and are supposed to improve the lubrication provided by said hydraulic fluids. US A 3 625 899 describes hydraulic brake fluids consisting of mixtures of at least one boric ester of an etherified glycol, of a polyglycol and a monoether or diether glycol. In the steps of this patent different streams or currents of research were followed. which differ from each other in the way of emphasizing a particular type of boron ester, but all of them having in common that in order to make the composition fall within the DOT 4 class, the presence of boron in the composition, in concentrations greater than a certain minimum value, is necessary. In said compositions part of the absorbed water is removed by hydrolysis reactions of the ester, the resulting boric acid showing the undesired tendency to precipitate. Moreover, the organoborates used in the process have the drawback of either causing the swelling of the rubber esters of etherified glycols or resulting in high viscosities esters of glycols . At any rate, they unavoiaaoiy cause higher costs in comparison to the traditional formulations. For this reason the formulations containing organoborates have not met wide acceptance on the market so far. Thus. there is the need for a brake fluid that may be a DOT 4 also in the absence of boron and, more in general, that shall have superior characteristics of resistance to moisture also in the presence of only slight quantities of boric esters. Thus it is one object of the present invention to provide compositions suited for use as hydraulic fluids which, though not containing boron compounds, possess WET PERT greater than 155 C and viscosities at 40 C below 1500 mm² s cSt , that is, fluids belonging to the classes DOT 3 as regards the viscosity and DOT 4 as regards the WET PERT at the same time. Still another object of this invention is to provide compositions containing boric esters which, at the same boron content, have WET PERT values greater than those of the compositions of the prior art. A further object of the present invention is to provide brake fluids which meet all the DOT 3 and DOT4 specifications more particularly such which meet the non aggressiveness standards towards rubber and the metals present in the braking system. This invention refers to boron containing a hydraulic fluid containing a glycol, a light ether of a glycol and a heavy ether of a glycol, characterized in that wherein A preferred light ether is triethylene glycol monoethylether and preferred heavy ethers are those wherein R H in the general formula. According to a particularly preferred embodiment the heavy ether is selected from the monomethylether of tetraethylene glycol, the monomethylether of pentaethylene glycol, the methyl or butyl ether of a polyoxyalkylene glycol having a molecular weight substantially equal to or lower than 520 and containing both oxypropylene and oxyethylene monomeric units and mixtures thereof. Whenever required, to the hydraulic fluids of the present invention there may be added additives for the purpose of boosting the performance of the braking fluids. The various possible types of additives comprise buffering agents, corrosion inhibitors, antioxidants, substances increasing the protective power with respect to ferrous metals in a humid and oxidizing environment, stabilizers, dyestuffs. In general the quantity of additives that may be incorporated into the hydraulic fluids varies from 0 to 10 , based on the total weight of the hydraulic fluids. A preferred hydraulic fluid contains from 0 to 10 by weight, based on the total weight of the fluid, of an inhibitor consisting of a mixture of The preparation of the boric esters is carried out at atmospheric pressure, preferably in the presence of an azeotropic solvent, or at a reduced pressure in the absence of a solvent, at temperatures between 50 C and 200 C. According to a further embodiment of the present invention, the hydraulic fluid contains a glycol, a light ether of a glycol and a heavy ether of a glycol, but no boron, and is characterized in that wherein The liquid compositions obtained by means of the present invention display all a WET PERT greater than 155 C lower limit of DOT 4 class , viscosity values at 40 C lower than 1500 mm² s cSt upper limit of class DOT 3 , and PERT values of about 250 C and above. Moreover, they are characterized by an almost total lack of aggressiveness towards the various types of rubber and metals present in the braking systems, with a resulting considerable advantage as to the life times of said systems. Moreover, they display all the properties typical for the traditional products of highest quality. The formulation of the hydraulic fluids according to the present invention is accomplished by mixing together the individual components and additives in a mixer until achieving a thorough and complete homogenization. In general the mixing is carried out at atmospheric pressure, room temperature and, preferably, in the absence of humidity. FR A 1 233 918 discloses hydraulic fluids containing more than 20 by weight of a polyoxyalkylene having a molecular weight of 500, at least 35 by weight of an ether of diethylene glycol and at least 5 by weight of a glycol, an alcohol, a triethylene glycol ether or mixtures thereof. According to said patent a preferred molecular weight of the polyoxyalkylene which, among others, may be a monoether of a polyalkylene glycol, is 2000 to 6000. In comparison thereto, in the hydraulic fluids of the present invention the molecular weight of the heavy ether may at the most be 600. This allows to reduce the amount of glycol to a minimum and at the same time to maintain a WET PERT which is considerably higher than that of the hydraulic fluids of the prior art.
