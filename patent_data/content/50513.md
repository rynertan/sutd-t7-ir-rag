When a control member 40 is operated hook like portions 20 of arms 10, 11 are clamped over the upper rims of the beam and at least one auxiliary clamping member 25, 26 is clamped against the lower part of the beam to assist the clamp to sustain side loads. The clamp may also be adapted to clamp on to round cross section bars or tubes.
