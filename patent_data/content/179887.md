## Description
The present invention relates, Antigens composed of several proteins which together form a distinct phenotype in a pathogenic bacterial strain or species, and which must therefore be assumed to contain a large number of immunogenic determinants, are well known. However, such antigens and vaccines produced from them have a number of disadvantages in particular, they have a tendency to be too selective in that, on immunization, antibodies are formed against each of these immunogenic determinants which together identify the one particular bacterial strain from which the antigen has been derived, but not other bacterial strains of the same species so that immunization is only effected against this particular strain, but not other, closely related strains of the same species. The present invention is an attempt to overcome these disadvantages by providing an antigenic composition which substantially only comprises the immunogenic determinant s which lead to the desired immunity and which is furthermore not limited to one particular strain of the pathogenic bacteria in question. It has become increasingly clear that the capacity of many pathogenic bacteria to adhere to the surface of cells is of primary importance for the initiation of many infectious diseases Beachey, In many pathogenic bacteria, the adhesin polypeptide proper is believed to form only part of a larger sequence of polypeptides which are all, in one way or another, related to the adhesion function e.g. polypeptides which mediate the transport of the adhesin through the cell wall or anchor it to the outer surface of the cell wall and so on , and in accordance with the aim of the present invention, a specific adhesin polypeptide is identified among the other polypeptides of the sequence and used as an antigen. This is thought to constitute a less selective identification marker so that antibodies will not only be raised against the strain from which the antigen is derived but also against the other pathogenic strains of the same bacterial species. Accordingly, the present invention relates to an antigenic composition characterized in that it comprises, as a major immunogenic component, Such major immunogenic component may comprise an amino acid sequence of at least 5 amino acids and up to the entire amino acid sequence of the adhesin polypeptide. The adhesin polypeptide may conveniently be derived from adhesin forming bacteria. This group of bacteria comprises both grampositive and gramnegative bacteria, and the bacterial species of the greatest interest in the present context from which it would be advantageous to derive one or more specific adhesin polypeptides are uropathogenic or enteropathogenic strains of Alternatively, the adhesin polypeptide may be prepared synthetically, as described below. For some pathogenic bacteria in this group, there is evidence that filamentous structures termed pili fimbriae projecting from the cell wall are in some way connected with adhesion, and therefore and because the pili are easily purified whole pili preparations have been used as antigens in vaccines, e.g. gonococcus pili antigen tested in US Army field tests . Previous investigators working with pili preparations went to great lengths in attempts to prepare pure pili protein for protein characterization and immunization, and their efforts were apparently successful in that their preparations only showed one band in SDS gels, US Patent No. 4,443,431 Buchanan T.M. et al Saliet I.E. E.C., Gottlisch, Extensive studies carried out by the applicants demonstrate, however, that the supposed pure pili protein in fact consists of several protein fractions with separate functions. In fact, the pilus filament is not responsible for the cell surface binding but a minor component considered to be a contaminant which is most likely associated with the filament is what is responsible for the cell surface binding. This unique observation could only be ascribed to the fact that the structural formation of pili and the property of adhesion to digalactoside receptors can be genetically dissociated. Other mutated organisms retaining recognizable pili structures but being unable to adhere further confirmed the observation. The implication of the observation was further that the pilus protein, previously supposed to be pure, must contain at least two fractions, one of which is a structural element involved in the actual formation of pili and the other one being a fraction responsible for the adhesion property. The fact that both fractions have antigenic properties opened up the possibility of engendering antibodies against only the adhesion responsible fraction. In the case of pilus carrying bacteria, too, it is advantageous to produce an antigen showing less strain selectivity, if any, and such an antigen is provided by identifying and producing one or more components which form part of the structure of the entire pilus and which mediate the adhesion capacity specifically. In the present context, such a component is termed a pilus adhesin polypeptide. In accordance with what is stated above, the pilus adhesin polypeptide usually comprises a minor component of the entire plus amino acid sequence of pili derived from pathogenic plus forming bacteria and is distinct from the pilin the subunit of the purified plus, forming the major part of the pilus fibre . Examples of pilus forming bacteria which are useful for this purpose are uropathogenic or enteropathogenic strains of For the purposes of the present invention, the investigations disclosed herein have primarily been concerned with a uropathogenic strain of In the course of the research leading to the present invention, the inventors have identified the region on the chromosome of a uropathogenic or any immunogenically active subsequence thereof, or or any immunogenically active subsequence thereof, or or any immunogenically active subsequence thereof. These amino acid sequences have been established by well known methods as described in Example 5. The absence of the latter two antigens have been positively demonstrated to cause lack of binding to the globoside receptor in all cases cf. Example 3 below and both of these are therefore assumed to be an adhesin polypeptide proper, while the former antigen has been shown to cause lack of binding in certain circumstances only cf. Example 3 below and is therefore assumed to be required for anchoring the adhesin polypeptide formed to the outer surface of the cell wall. It should be noted that the amino acid sequences shown above are the precursor forms of the pilus adhesin polypeptides containing N terminal signal peptide like sequences which are cleaved off when the polypeptide is exported through the bacterial inner membrane. In accordance with the principles of the invention, it is preferred that the antigenic composition of the invention be substantially free from other components related to the adhesion function such as other components of the pilus in order to avoid the formation of a wide variety of antibodies when the antigen is used for immunization with the consequent disadvantages outlined above. Most preferably, the antigen is in substantially pure form, i.e. also free from other determinants which are not in any way connected with adhesin formation but which might give rise to undesirable immunological reactions. In another aspect, the invention relates to an antibody raised against, or directed substantially only against, an antigen as specified above which, as its major immunizing component, comprises a determinant of an adhesin polypeptide or an immunogenically active subsequence thereof or a precursor therefor which is convertible to an immunologically active form. Such an antibody may be one which is obtained by immunizing an immunizable animal with an antigen as defined above and obtaining antiserum such as immunoglobulins from the animal in a manner known The antibody according to the invention is preferably also in substantially pure form which makes it useful for diagnostic purposes as described below. Alternatively, the antibody may also be produced by a hybridoma technique which is a well known method for producing antibodies. In the hybridoma technique using for instance mice as the animals immunized, mice are immunized with the antigen in question and spleen cells from the immunized mice are fused with myeloma cells whereupon the fused hybridoma cells are cloned, antibody producing cells are grown in a suitable growth medium and the antibodies are recovered from the culture. The antibodies obtained by the hybridoma technique have the advantage of greater specificity and hence, greater accuracy of e.g. diagnosis. In a possible further step, using recombinant DNA techniques, the gene or genes encoding the antibody are transferred from the hybridoma cell clone to a suitable vector, the hybrid vector is transformed to a suitable bacterial host, the host is grown in an appropriate medium and the resulting antibody is recovered from the culture. In this way, an improved yield of antibody may be obtained. The host may be one usually employed in the field of recombinant DNA technology such as A very important aspect of the present invention concerns a vaccine for immunizing a mammalian subject against diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria which adhere to mammalian tissue, which contains an immunogenically effective amount of an antigen as described above, optionally bound to a suitable carrier, together with an immunologically acceptable vehicle. This vehicle may be any vehicle usually employed in the preparation of vaccines, such as a diluent, suspending agent, adjuvant, etc. In some cases, it will not be necessary to use a carrier as the antigen tends to polymerize with itself, but in instances where this is not the case, it may be advantageous to bind the antigen covalently to a carrier. This carrier will usually be a polymeric carrier and especially when the vaccine is to be used to immunize human beings it is important that it be physiologically acceptable. Synthetic non toxic and or non allergenic carriers for the immobilization of antigens are known, e.g. from Arnon, The invention further relates to a method of preparing such a vaccine in which an immunogenically effective amount of an antigen as defined above, optionally bound to a suitable carrier, is combined, e.g. mixed, with an immunologically acceptable vehicle in an amount giving the desired concentration of the antigen in the vaccine preparation. In a particular embodiment of the method of the invention, an immunogenically active amino acid sequence comprising at least 5 amino acids is covalently bound to the physiologically acceptable carrier, such as one of those mentioned above. The techniques for preparing fused polypeptides are known, e.g. from Casadaban et al., In another embodiment of the method of the invention, the nucleotide sequence encoding an antigen as defined above is fused to the nucleotide sequence encoding a physiologically acceptable carrier polypeptide, the fused DNA sequence is inserted into a suitable vector, the hybrid vector is transformed to a suitable bacterial host, the host is grown in an appropriate medium, and the fused polypeptide is recovered from the culture and optionally purified. In a further aspect, the invention relates to a DNA fragment encoding a determinant of an adhesin polypeptide as defined above, encoding substantially no other antigen. This DNA fragment may be one which encodes the entire adhesin polypeptide or which encodes a precursor of an adhesin polypeptide which is convertible to an immunogenically active form or which encodes an immunogenically active subsequence of an adhesin polypeptide. This DNA may be part of the genetic information residing on the chromosome of or on a plasmid from pathogenic adhesin forming bacteria, representative examples of which are uropathogenic or enteropathogenic strains of Thus, the DNA fragment may be the DNA or part of the DNA sequence coding for a pilus adhesin polypeptide which may be derived from a pathogenic plus forming bacterium, such as a uropathogenic or enteropathogenic strain of For the purpose of exemplification, the DNA fragment may be one which completely or partially comprises the DNA sequence coding for one or more of the adhesin polypeptides from a uropathogenic strain of or any subsequence thereof which, when expressed, constitutes a determinant of a minor pilus component encoded by any one of the entire DNA sequences shown above. The sequence of the respective DNA fragments has been established by well known methods as described in Example 4. In a further, important aspect, the invention relates to a method of preparing an adhesin polypeptide or a determinant thereof as defined above, in which a bacterial host harbouring a hybrid vector containing an inserted DNA fragment encoding the polypeptide or the determinant is cultivated, and the product expressed from the DNA fragment is recovered, optionally followed by purification. The DNA fragment which encodes an adhesin polypeptide or an immunogenically active subsequence thereof or a precursor therefor which is convertible to an immunologically active form may be obtained, e.g., by excising the same from the bacterial DNA in which it occurs in nature by recombinant DNA technology, e.g. as follows As purification by classical chemical methods of the minor plus adhesin polypeptide from a preparation in which it is present in admixture with the major pilus structural component which is normally produced from the same operon is extremely difficult, if not impossible, due to the fact that the structural component, which is immunogenic In accordance with a special embodiment, several genes encoding one or several of the desired adhesin polypeptides may be inserted in the same vector, so that the resulting product produced by the microorganism will be a product with recurring determinants of the antigen in question, thus enhancing the immunogenity or receptor binding efficiency. All of these operations are carried out in accordance with methods well known in the field of recombinant DNA technology and explained in more detail in Examples 1 3 below. The vector used in this method may be any vector usually employed for the purpose such as pBR322 derivatives, Purification which, as mentioned above, will be advantageous in many cases as the formation of irrelevant antibodies, i.e. antibodies which take no part in the immunization against the antigen in question, and which may even give rise to undesirable reactions on the part of the animal in which it is formed, is avoided as is the administration concurrently with the antigen of possible toxic substances formed by the host bacterium, e.g. a lipopolysaccharide, has, however, been found to be problematic. In order to facilitate purification, a method has been devised involving the use of fused polypeptides. In this method, a DNA fragment encoding a first polypeptide comprising the adhesin polypeptide or an immunogenically active subsequence thereof or a precursor therefor which is convertible to an immunologically active form is fused to a DNA sequence encoding a second polypeptide, the fused DNA sequence is inserted into a suitable bacterial host, the host is grown in an appropriate medium, the fused polypeptide is recovered from the culture and purified using an assay involving antibodies raised against the second polypeptide, and the second polypeptide is optionally cleaved off by means of a suitable protease followed by separation of the two polypeptides. An example of a DNA sequence which may advantageously be employed for this purpose is the After purification, the second polypeptide may be cleaved off by means of a protease such as trypsin or chymotrypsin. Desired peptide fragments which only derive from the DNA fragment encoding the first polypeptide to which the gene coding for the second polypeptide has been fused are selected on the basis of their immunogenic activity, e.g. as tested In an alternative method of preparing the antigen of the invention, the adhesin polypeptide such as the pilus adhesin polypeptide or immunogenically active subsequence thereof may be prepared by peptide synthesis according to well known methods such as by liquid phase peptide synthesis or by solid phase peptide synthesis cf. for instance Stewart and Young, According to the invention, the antibody raised against, or directed substantially against, an antigen which comprises a determinant of an adhesin polypeptide or an immunogenically active subsequence thereof or a precursor therefor which is convertible to an immunologically active form may be used in a composition for the passive immunization of a mammalian subject against diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria which adhere to mammalian tissue, which comprises an immunologically effective amount of an antibody as defined above, optionally bound to a suitable carrier, together with an immunologically acceptable vehicle. This composition may be prepared by a method comprising combining an immunogenically effective amount of the antibody with the immunologically acceptable vehicle, e.g. by mixing the components. The carrier to which the antibody is optionally covalently bound may be any of the carriers mentioned above in connection with the description of the vaccine. The vehicle with which the antibody is mixed may be any vehicle usually employed for this purpose, such as a diluent, suspending agent, adjuvant, etc., added in an amount to give the desired concentration of antibody in the composition. Though less efficient for immunization than the antigen described above, the antibody may thus be used for immunization purposes, but its principal use is as a diagnostic agent for the diagnosis of infectious diseases caused by pathogenic adhesin forming bacteria which adhere to mammalian, e.g. human, tissue, examples of which are uropathogenic or enteropathogenic strains of When used as diagnostic agents, the antibodies may be labelled with, for instance, a colouring agent so that bacteria containing the antigen to be detected appear as coloured agglomerates in the diagnostic test. Other standard methods such as enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA cf. Materials and Methods or radioimmunoassay RIA using radiolabelled antibodies may also be employed. Alternatively, a diagnostic agent may comprise a stable, labelled DNA sequence which is at least about 60 homologous with a DNA sequence in the bacterium whose presence or absence is to be established by the diagnostic test. In the present context, the term stable is intended to indicate that the nucleotide sequence is relatively constant, i.e. that base pair substitutions in which one base pair is replaced by another are reasonably infrequent. In many genes, such base pair substitutions are relatively common without necessarily affecting the amino acid composition of the gene products which are expressed from them, but the base pair substitutions affect the diagnostic process which relies on a fairly high degree of homology between the DNA from the probe and the bacterial DNA used as the specimen to be tested, as the DNA sub sequence of the probe recognizes the same sequence or one which resembles it rather closely in the bacterial DNA. In the diagnostic process, probe DNA is labelled, and the DNA is denatured to separate the strands in both the probe and the bacterial DNA after mixing the DNAs, the strands are left to reform the double helical structure, but in case of homology DNA sequence recognition , some of the probe DNA will have been introduced in the bacterial DNA. This technique is known as hybridzation and is described in e.g. Southern, The DNA sequence used as probe DNA may be one which comprises a gene which is part of an adhesin gene cluster, but which does not encode the adhesin polypeptide itself, or a diagnostically effective subsequence therof. This gene may, for instance, be one which codes for a pilus polypeptide produced by a pathogenic pilus forming bacterium which is not a pilus adhesin polypeptide, or a diagnostically effective subsequence thereof. In the system exemplified herein, the DNA sequence encoding the pilus polypeptide or a subsequence thereof is derived from a uropathogenic strain of As described above, the adhesin polypeptide or a determinant thereof according to the invention may be used as a component of a vaccine. Accordingly, this invention also comprises the use of an adhesin polypeptide or a determined thereof, for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for preventing or reducing the possibility of infection with pilus forming bacteria, especially for the preparation of a vaccine against pathogenic pilus forming bacteria. These pathogenic bacteria may be any bacteria which form adhesins or adhesin like polypeptides, examples of which are uropathogenic or enteropathogenic strains of Finally, it is contemplated that the antigen encoded by the DNA fragment according to the present invention may be employed to determine the presence of the receptor for the particular adhesin polypeptide or active part thereof on mammalian tissue cells such as epithelial cells. This is of potential importance for identifying persons belonging to high risk groups, i.e. persons who appear to be predisposed for certain kinds of infection as such persons are those who produce large amounts of the receptor to which the pathogenic bacteria causing the infection in question bind by means of the adhesins they produce. When such persons have been identified, prophylactic treatment, i.e. principally immunization vaccination, may be carried out. The method of determining the presence of the adhesin receptor and the amounts of adhesin receptor present may comprise incubating a specimen comprising tissue samples or cell scrapings with the adhesin followed by washing. An antibody raised against the adhesin and labeled with, e.g., fluorescence or a radioactive isotope such as 1 125, may be incubated with the specimen, or alternatively the thus labeled adhesin may be used directly in the test. The amount of adhesin receptor in the specimen may then be determined by measuring the amount of radioactivity or fluorescence in the specimen in a manner known Specifically, it is contemplated that the adhesin polypeptides of a uropathogenic strain of This can be expressed generally as a method of determining receptor density or distribution in a host mammal such as a human, comprising treating a tissue sample from the host with a receptor specific polypeptide, removing unbound receptor specific polypeptide and determining the amount of receptor specific polypeptide bound. The determination of the amount of polypeptide bound may either be made by labeling the polypeptide or by incubating the specimen with a labeled antibody, such as described above. This method is very advantageous compared to previous methods where the receptor density or receptor distribution was determined by means of an antibody which was directed against the specific receptors, the reason being that the receptor specific polypeptide, exemplified by the adhesin polypeptide, can bind to the specific receptor, whether the receptor itself, which is usually one or two sugars, is at the end of a chain of sugars or whether the system of two sugars is somewhere in the middle of the chain, whereas the antibody will only recognize two sugars at the end of the chain, but not the sugars in the middle. Therefore, the binding repertoire of the antibody is limited as compared with the adhesin polypeptide and any attempt to quantify a receptor density will be always underestimated when using antibody for direct combination with the receptors. Finally, preventing or reducing the possibility of infection of a human being or other mammal with a pathogenic adhesin binding microorganism, could be by treating a human being or another mammal with one or more adhesin polypeptides in a suitable method to distribute the polypeptides over the cell surfaces for which infection with a specific pathogenic bacteria is to be prevented, the adhesin polypeptide used being an adhesin polypeptide that will bind with the receptors with which the adhesin generated by the pathogenic bacteria will bind. In this case the adhesin polypeptide is not used as an antigen, but as a direct preventive therapeutic agent to occupy the receptors, thus making it impossible for the pathogenic bacteria to bind to the receptor. In most topical infections, the first step is a specific binding to the specific cell surface of adhesin polypeptide from the specific bacteria, which means that when the receptors are already occupied, the first step in a process to develop an infection cannot take place. With the bacteria being unable to bind, the infection does not occur. The invention is further described with reference to the drawings in which The construction and characterization of the plasmids shown in the drawing are described in Materials and Methods as well as in Examples 1 3. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH or New England BioLabs, and used as recommended by the manufacturers. Filling in of 3 recessive ends was performed by using the Klenow fragment New England BioLabs in ligation buffer to which 200 µM each of the required dNTPs had been added. The X Pili were purified according to a modification of the method described by Brinton et al., For slide agglutination, bacterial cells grown for 22 hours on glucose free L agar were suspended to about 10¹⁰ cells ml in agglutination buffer 150 mM NaCl 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 containing 3 heparinized and washed human erythrocytes. The reaction, when positive, was usually apparent within 60 seconds. The positive reaction was a macroscopically visible aggregation of erythrocytes. In the semiquantitative assay, cells grown as above were resuspended to an A₆₀₀ 20. They were then serially 2 fold diluted in 50 µl agglutination buffer using microtiter plates with conical bottom wells Linbro Titertek, cat. no. 76 321 05, CT, USA . To this was added 10 µl of a 3 erythrocyte suspension in the same buffer. The dilution in the last well giving a positive agglutination after 2 hours at 4 C was taken as the agglutination titer. The cell count of the original suspension was used together with the titer, to calculate the minimum bacterial concentration required for agglutination. The agglutination titer of purified pili was determined essentially in the same way as that used for whole cells. When using agglutination buffer, however, the pilus concentration required for agglutination was very high and various attempts were made to increase the sensitivity of the assay. Since pili are negatively charged at physiological pH and aggregate in the presence of 167 mM MgCl₂ see Preimmune sera were obtained from two healthy 1.8 kg female New Zealand white rabbits by cardiac puncture, filter sterilized and stored at 20 C. 75 µg of purified Pap pili in 1.0 ml of isotonic saline was emulsified with an equal volume of Freund s complete adjuvant and injected in 0.5 ml amounts into four sites, namely subscapularly at two sites and intramuscularly into the two hind legs. After 6 weeks, a booster injection with Freund s complete adjuvant was given. Ten days after the second immunization, the animals were bled by cardiac puncture, and the serum was filter sterilized and stored with 0.02 sodium azide at 20 C. For slide agglutination, bacteria were grown and prepared as described for the hemagglutination assays. Agglutination tests of whole cells were performed with 500 fold diluted PBS pH 7.5 antiserum raised against purified Pap pili cf. above . The positive reaction was determined as a macroscopically visible aggregation of bacteria which appeared within 60 seconds. Plasmid pPAP5 and its derivatives were transformed to the minicell producing strain P678 54 Adler et al., Radioactive samples were suspended in 100 µl of sampling buffer containing 62.5 mM Tris HCl pH 6.8 . 1 sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS , 0.5 β mercaptoethanol, and 10 glycerol. After 5 minutes of boiling, the extracts were electrophoresed in 15 polyacrylamide slab gels containing 0.1 SDS Laemmli, Transposon mutagenesis with Tn5 was performed essentially as described by Björk and Olsén, Cells of strain P678 54 containing various hybrid plasmids were grown on tryptic soy agar in the presence of the appropriate antibiotics. Bacteria were harvested after overnight growth at 37 C suspended in PBS pH 7.2 Brij 35 to a cell density of 1.5 absorbance units at 560 nm, and collected by centrifugation 12,000 x g for 10 minutes . The cell pellet was next suspended in 400 µl of 1 Nonidet P 40 1 sodium deoxycholate 0.1 SDS 0.15 m NaCl 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.2 containing lysozyme at 1 mg ml and was incubated for 10 minutes at 4 C 26 . A 400 µl sample of a 1 15,000 dilution of Pap antisera was added to the cell extract. After incubation at 4 C for 16 hours, the cell extract antibody mixture was clarified by centrifugation 12,000 x g for 10 minutes . Disposable microtiter hemagglutination plates Cooke polystyrene, 96 U wells were exposed to 100 µl of a 1 µg ml solution of purified Pap pili per well in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer pH 9.6 for 16 hours at 25 C. The wells were washed three times with 0.15 M NaCl containing 0.05 vol vol Brij 35 Sigma to remove unbound pili. Anti Pap pilus rabbit antiserum was diluted in PBS pH 7.2 with 0.05 vol vol Brij 35 to a concentration which resulted in 50 maximal binding 1 30,000 dilution and was then mixed with serial dilutions in PBS Brij lysates of whole bacteria, cell free extracts, or Pap pili positive control , or without added pili negative control . After incubation for 16 hours at 4 C, 100 µl samples were transferred to the sensitized microtiter wells. The plates were incubated for 3 hours at 37 C and were then washed three times with NaCl Brij . Alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti rabbit immunoglobulin G diluted 1 1,000 in PBS Brij was added to all wells and incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. The plates were washed three times with PBS Brij , and 1 mg of Western blotting after SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified pili was performed as described by Swanson et al., The 9.6 kb long The following manipulations were done to construct plasmid pPAP16 Fig. 2 and derivatives of both this plasmid and pPAP5 with mutations in the Plasmid pPAP9 did not complement Tn5 insertions within the High molecular weight chromosomal DNA from a spontaneously Lac derivative of a uropathogenic isolate of Individual colonies were screened for agglutination of human erythrocytes in the presence of 1 of mannose, and the clone pRHU807 causing mannose resistant hemagglutination was selected. Subclones pRHU30 and pRHU845 of pRHU807 were constructed retaining MRHA as described by R. Hull et al., The structural gene for the major polypeptide forming the Pap pili associated with pyelonephritis pilus To characterize the genes required for Pap pilus formation and digalactoside specific agglutination, subclones of pRHU845 and transposon Tn5 insertion mutants were constructed and analyzed as described in Normark et al., The region identified in Example 2 as necessary for Pap pilus formation and digalactoside specific binding was recloned as a 9.6 kb long Tn5 insertions in the distal part of pap DNA abolish hemagglutination but allow Pap pili to be formed. It was thus assumed that the genes mediating agglutination would be located in this region. To further investigate the importance of the polypeptides encoded here, the To further define the genes on the The polypeptides expressed from pPAP5 and its three mutant derivatives were ³⁵S methionine labelled in The To confirm the position of the Tn5 mutations relative to the As indicated above, Tn5 insertions in The plus antigen formation and digalactoside specific binding properties of the various mutant derivatives of pPAP5 or pPAP22 in pSN plasmids are pACYC184 derivatives carrying the It appears from the table that mutation Mutations in genes 100 µg of pPAP9 constructed as described in Materials and Methods shown in Fig. 2 was digested with Aliquots of this fragment were digested with the endonucleases Among the possible reading frames, the genes Several fragments from the Detailed restriction maps of pDC5 and pPlL110 35 were constructed and found to be nearly identical with the restriction map of pPAP5 with respect to the Plasmid pPAP9 was digested with In an alternative method to that disclosed in Example 7, N terminal DNA fragments comprising the Fragments containing the DNA fragments encoding the N terminal portion of the This construction is transformed to a strain containing the The entire Assuming that plus formation and adhesion are linked in This clone is then used directly or as a probe to obtain a larger DNA fragment containing the pilin gene. This fragment is then cloned into a Alternatively, if the chromosomal DNA is cloned directly into a Fusion proteins and protein production in Similar methods as those described in Examples 1 5 as well as those outlined for In principle, all investigations may be carried out using protein chemistry. The adhesin polypeptides may be enriched purified by receptor, e.g. digalactoside, affinity chromatography or any other appropriate method such as antibody affinity chromatography . The purity of the protein may be assayed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described in Materials and Methods. To ensure that the adhesins constitute a large fraction of the preparation, equilibrium dialysis experiments with the radioactively labelled receptor may be employed to calculate the number of binding sites per molecule of protein present. This is expected to be between 0.1 and 10 ligands per molecule of protein. All bacterial strains are Plasmid pPAP5 cf. General Materials and Methods above is a pBR322 derivative carrying a 9.5 kb The following concentrations of antibiotics were used for selection carbenicillin 100 µg ml, tetracycline 15 µg ml, kanamycin 20 µg ml and chloramphenicol 20 µg ml. Bacteria were grown at 37 C in Luria broth or on Luria agar. The CaCl₂ procedure was used for transformation. Plasmid DNA was isolated by a modification of the alkaline clear lysate procedure of Birnboim H.C. and J. Doly A rapid alkaline extraction procedure for screening recombinant plasmid DNA ³²P labelled DNA probes were prepared by nick translation or by priming DNA synthesis of cloned M13 single stranded DNA templates with an M13 hybridization probe primer New England BioLabs . α³²P dGTP Amersham, England was incorporated to a specific activity of approximately 1 10⁸ cpm µg. Plasmid DNA, size fractionated on agarose gels, was transferred to nitrocellulose filters Schleicher and Schüll, BA85 according to Southern, E.M., Detection of specific sequences among DNA fragments separated by gel electrophoresis , Plasmids pPAP5, pPAP502, pDC5 and pPlL10 35 were transformed into the minicell producing strain AA10. Preparation and labeling of minicells with ³⁵S methionine Amersham was as described by Thompson, R., and M. Achtman, The control region of the F sex factor DNA transfer cistrons restriction mapping and DNA cloning , Relevant fragments were cloned into phage M13 cloning vectors M13mp8 and M13mp9 and transformed into The binding properties of the gene products encoded by the plasmids listed in Tables 1 and 2 were determined by slide agglutination as described in General Materials and Methods above using P₁ erythrocytes containing the globoside receptor and p erythrocytes which lack the globoside. Slide agglutination, utilizing antisera raised against purified Pap pili 37 were performed as described in General Materials and Methods above. Antiserum was used as a 500 fold dilution in PBS pH 7.5 . Plasmid pPAP43 is a derivative of pPAP5, obtained by Electron microscopy was performed using a JEOL 100B microscope with 100 mesh copper grids coated with thin films of 2 formvar. Bacteriz were resuspended in 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 10 mM MgCl₂ and placed on the grid. The excess was immediately removed by aid of a filter paper. Grids were then washed with buffer and negatively stained for 5 seconds with 3.55 ammonium molybdate followed by washing with redistilled water. All three plasmids were shown to encode globoside binding specificity Table 2 . The chromosomal inserts of the plasmids were mapped with several restriction endonucleases. To allow the detection of even small discrepancies in fragment size, the restriction enzyme digests of the different plasmids were analyzed in parallel slots by agarose gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 1, the central Plasmid pPlL110 35 carries a 5.7 kb DNA fragment that extends leftwards of the conserved A DNA probe derived conventionally from the coding part of Three genes, Proteins expressed from pPAP5, pDC5 and pPlL110 35 were ³⁵S methionine labelled in A highly expressed 17K polypeptide from pDC5 and pPlL110 35 has been assigned to the distal Since pDC5 contains DNA highly homologous to To see if the adhesin function also could be complemented between the gene clusters, pPAP502 lacking the DNA from the Globoside binding specificity was determined by positive slide hemagglutination HA of P₁ erythrocytes containing the globoside receptor and negative HA of p erythrocytes which lack the globoside. Assay conditions were as described in General Materials and Methods above. N.D. not determined. Complementation of plasmid mutations harboured in HB101 was monitored by slide hemagglutination of P₁ erythrocytes as described in Materials and Methods and in General Materials and Methods above. The The specimens consisted of 66 isolates of The complete medium was Luria broth medium of Bertani supplemented with medium E and 0.2 glucose. The bacteria were grown at 37 C with shaking. Luria broth agar plates without glucose were used for agglutination assay. For identification of digalactoside binding Each bacterial isolate was grown in 100 ml LB medium to 4 10⁸ cells ml. The bacteria were collected by centrifugation, suspended in 40 ml PBS 100 mM K phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl , recentrifugated and suspended in 5 ml PBS 0.1 mg ml proteinase K, 5 mM EDTA and 0.5 SDS sodium dodecyl sulphate . The suspensions were incubated overnight at room temperature and finally extracted with phenol and precipitated with ethanol, repeated twice. Plasmid pPAP5 and pDC5 were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and DNA fragments were purified and ³²P labelled by nicked translation. A dot blot procedure was followed. 2 µg of chromosomal DNA was dissolved in 170 µl 0.1M Tris pH 7.4 . After the addition of 30 µl 2M NaOH and 100 µl 3M NaCl 0.3M sodium citrate, the mixture was incubated at 80 C for 20 minutes. The denatured DNA was chilled, neutralized with 40 µl 2M Tris pH 7 and sucked through a 7 mm² area on a nitrocellulose filter, air dried and then baked in vacuo at 65 C for 12 hours. The filters were incubated for 2 hours in 10 Denhardt Denhardt 0.02 polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02 Ficoll, 0.02 BSA . They were once again incubated in a solution containing 4 SSC, 0.1 SDS, 2 mM EDTA, 10 Denhardt and 50 µg ml calf thymus DNA heated for 3 minutes at 95 C and incubated for one hour at 65 C. Finally they were incubated with a radiolabelled probe in the same solution as described above for 16 hours in 60 C and then washed in 4 SSC 2 5 minutes and 2 SSC 2 20 minutes at 60 C and then air dried. The filters were exposed to Dupont Cronex 4 X ray film together with an intensifying screen at 70 C and then developed. The results obtained in this Example demonstrate that a large number of the clinical isolates of
