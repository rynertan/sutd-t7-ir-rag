## Description
Anti Interleukin 2 Monoclonal AntibodiesThis invention concerns monoclonal antibodies which recognize interleukin 2 IL 2 a cytokine important in the regulation of immune function. Immunoassay of IL 2 and thereapy of immuno deficiency diseases are made possible by these monoclonal antibodies.INTRODUCTIONThe regulation of immune function Paetkau, V., Nature Lond. 294 689 1981 and tumor growth Sparn, M. B.and Todaro, G. J., N. Engl. J. med. 303, 878 1980 by hormone like factors, cytokines, has become the subject of increasing interest. One such cytokine,Interleukin 2 IL 2 has been discovered Morgan, D. A. etal., Science 193, 1007 1976 . It is produced byT lymphocytes after antigen or mitogen stimulation and is required for the proliferation of activated T cells. 1112 is an essential mediator of the immune response Ruscetti, F. W. and Gallo, R. C., Blood 57, 379 1981 Smith, K. A., Immunol. Rev., 51 337 1980 .It plays a central role in the cellular immune response to foreign antigens as well as in the development or sustaining of certain lymphoid leukemias Poiesz, B. J.et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Science, 77 6815 1980 .There is preliminary evidence that 1112 may also be responsible for the clonal growth of human lymphblastic leukemias Venuta, S. et al. Blood 1982 . Furthermore it has been demonstrated that the mitogenic response of lymphocytes from patients with severe immunodeficiencies can be restored in vitro by adding highly purified IL 2 to the tissue cultures. To date there is some indication that pure human IL 2 might restore some immunfunctions even in vivo as demonstrated in a first clinical trial in a patient with severe combined immunodeficiency Nezelof Syndrom .Studies on the physiology and pathaphysiology of 1112 are dependent on the availability of a well defined, biochemically and biologically homogenous molecule. 1112 has been purified to apparent homogeneity Welte,X. et al. Jt Exp. Med. 1982 in order to study its role as mediator of the normal immune response, in human immunodeficiency syndromes and in acute lymphblastic leukemias ALL . Bowever, further elucidation of the biological significance of this important cytokine await further purification.SUMMARY. OF THE INVENTION 1112 purified by known methods Welte, et al. supra was used to produce a mouse monoclonal antibody against 1112 by the technique of Köhler Milstein. The fusion resulted in hybrid clones producing anti IL 2 of various subclasses IgA, IgG 2b, IgM . The hybrid clone secreting anti IL 2 antibody of subclass IgA was selected as preferred embodiment of the present invention. All anti IL 2 antibodies inhibited the proliferation of IL 2 dependent human and mouse cell lines in response to human highly purified IL 2.One of these antibodies chosen for further characterization selectively precipitated 14K125I IL 2 as well as 16K125I IL 2 and 17K125I IL 2.The anti IL2 antibodies are useful in the purification of IL 2 in the establishment of screening assays forIL 2,immunoassays of IL 2, radioimmunoassay and enzymelinked immunoassay, for example, ELISA, RIA and for dissection of the role of IL 2 in the immune system.Furthermore these monoclonal antibodies facilitate the investigation of the previously obs erved heterogeneity of IL 2. The antiCIL2 monoclonal antibodies of the present invention are also useful as therapeutic agents in clinical syndromes which are associated with pathological proliferation of IL 2 dependent cells. Thus, for example, cutaneous T cell lymphomas, acute lymphoblastic leukemias ALL and hyperimmune syndromes such asGraft versus Host disease GvH may be treated. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the anti IL 2 monoclonal antibodies are used as then peutic agents directly without further modification thereof. Alternatively, the antibodies may be coupled to cytotoxic agents which are capable of blocking IL 2 dependent cell divisions.The monoclonal antibodies of the present invention are capable of. recognizing specifically cells expressing IL 2 receptors where the coupled cytotoxic agents exert there effect on blocking IL 2 dependent cell divisions.The monoclonal antibodies of the present invention are also useful diagnostic reagents for cells which contain IL 2 either on the cell surface or within the cytoplasm of the cells. Thus by means of the present invention, cells containing IL 2 may be identified in samples having different kinds of cells. Localization of IL 2 containing cells is possible in cultured cell colonies or in tissue specimens. Whenused in this manner the monoclonal antibodies are preferably coupled to flourescent, color forming substance such as an enzyme or chromophor, or a radioactive substance.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThe following description is intended to illustrate this invention without limiting same in any manner especially with respect to substantially functional equivalents hybridomas, monoclonal antibodies and cell lines described herein.Availability of cell lines, hybridomas and monoclonal antibodiesThe cell lines, hybridomas and monoelonal antibodies disclosed in the present invention bear the designated deposit number and are deposited with American Type rture Collection, Rockville, Maryland, U S A. Deposit is for the purpose of enabling disclosure only and is not intended to limit the concept of the present invention to the particular materials deposited. The file number of the culture deposit is HB 8456I. Production of mAbSource of 111 2 .111 2 was purified from lymphocyte conditioned medium to apparent homogeneity as described earlier copending U. S. Patent Application No. 370,223 .As judged by silver staining of sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS PAGE , IL 2 consists of 3 bands corresponding to molecular weights of 14,500, 16,000 and 17,000 daltons. The proteins eluted from each of those 3 bands showed IL 2 activity.Assay for 111 2 was detected by assay reported previously. Welte, K., et al. supra . The purity of the IL 2 used for the immunization is an important criterion. For all injections material was applied consisting of predominantly the 16K and 17K IL 2. Both the 16K and 17K molecular weight IL 2 species exhibit biological activity. Immunization A 8 week old BALB c x C57B6 female mouse was immunized six times in two weekly intervals with 1 ml of highly purified 111 2 600 800 U ml by i. p injections. 5 days after the last immunization the spleen of the mouse was removad and used for the fusion. Fusion Approximately 100 x 106 immuno splenocytes were fused to 40 x 106 NS 1 mouse myeloma cells according to the method of Koehler and Milsteinx Three weeks after the fusion outgrowing clones were tested for immunoglobulin production by enzyme linked immunoassay ELISA technique and the specificity of positive clones established by a neutralization assay for IL 2. Clones producing specific antibodies were subcloned four times and either expanded as mass cultures or grown in nude mice or as ascites in syngeneic mice. Antibody detection assay After fusion, the growing clones were screened for antibody production by enzyme linked immunoassay ELISA . 10ul culture supernatant was bound to a Terasaki plate Falcon overnight at 40 C. Then a second antibody rabbit anti mouse IG serum at a dilution of 1 500 was added for 45 minutes at 370 C. After washing, 10ul of goat anti rabbit alkaline phosphate conjugate diluted 1 500 was added for 45 minutes at 370 C. Finally, after 30 45 minutes incubation with a substrate P nitrophenyl phosphate PNp at 370 C, the plates were read by an ELISA reader with print out of the measured absorbance.Purification of anti IL 2 antibodyA clone designated number FW 4 , producing anti IL 2 antibodies designated number monoclonal antibody FW 4 , was propagated in nude mice Swiss background and or as mass tissue culture. Culture supernatants, containing 4 immunoglobulin free fetal calf serum FCS or mouse sera were passed over a CM Affi gel Blue column and the fall through fractions collected. Proteases and the bulk of albumin remained bound to the column.The anti IL 2 antibody containing fall through fractions were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialyzed against the appropriate buffer Phosphate buffered saline PBS or tris HCL, pH 7.8 and loaded either on an ion exchange chromatography column or on a gel filtration column. Anti IL 2 eluted from the ion exchange chromatography in the unbound protein fractions and in the gel filtration chromatography was collected in fractions corresponding to MW of 150,000 170,000 daltons. The anti IL 2 antibodycontaining fractions were stored in aliquots at 700 C.The fusion of spleen cells from mice immunized with highly purified human IL 2 with NS 1 myeloma cells resulted in the outgrowth of 107 clones of which 71 clones produced immunoglobulins detected by the ELISA technique. 5 of 25 clones tested for neutralization of IL 2 activity showed an inhibition of IL 2 activity.These clones produced immunoglobulin of the IgM, IgG 2b and IgA subclasses, respectively, as determined byOuchterlony technique. The IgA secreting clone, FW4, was chosen for all further experiments. It is a stable, fast growing hybrid after four subcloning cycles by limiting dilution technique. The immunoglobulin subclass of the Ig producing clone was determined by testing tissue culture supernatant with mouse IG hea y chain specific reagents by Ouchterlony technique.Supernatants from the IgA secreting hybrid, grown in 4 immunoglobulin free FCS was collected and purified by chromatography on CM Affi gel blue and gel filtration on AcA 34 Ultrogel. The procedure resulted in removal of the bulk of unspecific proteins including proteases.After the final gel filtration step high neutralizing activity was recovered from fact cons 39 41 corresponding to MW of 150,000 170,000 daltons.II. Biochemical characterization of anti IL 2 antibody, FW 4 Neutralization assay a The effect of anti IL 2 on T cell mitogen induced proliferation was tested. Ficol hypaque separated mononuclear blood cells from normal donors were resuspended at 4 x 106 cells ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 heat inactivated fetal calf serum FCS and glutamine 2mM . Each sample was stimulated in triplicate microwell culture with either medium alone or Phytohemagglutinin 0.5 , PHA M . All stimulation assays were done in the presence or absence of 100 ul antibody solution anti IL 2 or control . The cultures were pulsed at day 3 with tritiated thymidine 3H dT, 0.5 uCi microplate well, specific activity, 20 mCi mM and the incorporation of 3H dT measured. Significant inhibition was observed with 1 ug anti IL 2 per 1 nglml IL 2. Anti IL 2 mAb FW 4 also inhibited in a dose depen dent manner the proliferation of T cell lines dependent on IL 2 a 3 4 week cultures of human PHA stimulated lymphocytes, b Mouse cytotoxic T cell lines CTLL 1 and A2. As shown in Table 1, the proliferation was in hibited even in culture medium containing IL 2 concentrations as high as 10 U ml and 100 U ml IL 2, respectively. These data suggest that anti IL 2 mAb FW 4 reacts with the biologically active site of IL 2. Table 1 Dose dependent inhibition of the IL 2 effect on IL 2 dependent cell lines by mAb FW 4 mAb FW 4 nq ml lL 2 ng ml 1000 500 25 125 62.5 10 100 88 58 21 11 50 96 70 42 19 8 100 94 70 31 9 0 b Inhibition of growth of human and mouse CTLL This specificity of mAb FW 4 was established by demonstrating the dose dependent inhibition of pure IL 2 on IL 2 dependent mouse T cell lines CTLL 7, and A 2, and PHA induced normal human lymphocytes after three weeks of IL 2 dependent culture. Proliferation of human CTLL, mouse CTLL cells in the presence of variable amounts of monoclonal antibodies against IL 2 was compared to the IL 2 standard curve obtained in the absence of anti IL 2 antibodies to determine the percentage of inhibition of IL 2 activity.The proliferation was inhibited even in culture medium containing 10 U ml and 100 U ml IL 2, respectively. These data suggest that anti IL 2 reacts with the biologically active site of IL 2.Species SDecificityIL 2 from various species mouse, rat, human were inhibited in the same amount in support of growth of mouse CTLL.Immunoglobulin Sub classThe hybrids produce mAbs of the IgM IgG2b and IgA immunoglobulin subclasses as determined by Ouchterlony technique. Since monoclonal antibodies of IgA subclass are rarely generated, this preferred clone was characterized in more detail. This IgA monoclonal antibody should be useful for employing double labeling techniques for immunofluorescent analyses of IL 2 producer and responder cells. The IgA nature of this antibody was supported by data received from the purification of culture supernatants free of fetal calf immunoglobulin which demonstrated that the mAb FW 4 has an approximate molecular weight of 160,000 daltons as determined by gel filtration. Further evidence comes from analysis of metabolically labeled S methionine mAb FW 4 on SDS PAGE under reducing conditions showing one heavy chain with approximate molecular weight of 55,000 daltons and two light chains with molecular weight of 22,000 and 24,000 daltons. One light chain is the kappa light chain produced by the parental myeloma line, the second light chain is probably of the lamda type although we were not able to prove this by theOuchterlony technique and derived from the B cell fusion partner of the hybrid. Immunoprecipitatian procedure and following SDS PAGE a highly purified IL 2 The IL 2 specificity of mAb FW 4 was further supported by the immunoprecipitation studies. Using highly purified IL 2 consisting predominantly of 14K and 17K molecular weights, stabilized with BSA, IL 2 was precipitated but not albumine. Highly purified IL 2 consisting of only the 14K and 17X species was labeled with 125Iodine Lacto peroxidase technique . Traces of albumin present in the buffer for stabilization after the iodini zation were labeled incidentically. Using the anti IL 2 antibody fraction 39 41 of AcA 34, corresponding to 160 K MW and fraction 44 46 corresponding to 130 K MW as control, the 14K and 17K.IL 2 were precipitated specifically. In the control, no IL 2 was precipitated. b Partially purified IL 2 By using partially purified IL 2 for immunoprecipi tation, it was found that the anti IL 2 antibody detects besides the IL 2 species between 14K and 17K, protein between 26K and 32K. Both the 26K and 32K IL 2 were present in some purification procedures depending on induction conditions and copurified with the 14K, 16K and 17K IL 2 until the last step of purification. Highly purified IL 2 as well as partially purified IL 2 was iodinated 1251 by the lactoperoxidase method by methods known in the art. 100 ul of the labeled protein solution ca. 400,000 cpm were incubated with 200 ul antibody solution previously purified by Ion exchange chromatography DEAE cellulose and or gel filtration onAcA 34 ultrogel and subsequently with 50 ul rabbit anti mouse Ig serum for 16 hours at 40 C. Then Staphylococcus Protein A was added for one hour at room temperature and the immune complexes were washed and analyzed in a SDS PAGE 7 15 acrylamide gradient under reducing conditions Laemmli, U. K., et al. Nature 277 680 1970 .As control material, eluated from the AcA 34 column in the 100,000 molecular weight range anti IL 2 purification step and antibodies against lung tumor cell surface antigens or supernatants from NS 1 myeloma cell cultures, which showed no inhibition in the neutralization assay for r11 2, were treated in the same way. I IL 2 was precipitated specifically by mAb FW 4, while in the control only background staining was observed.
