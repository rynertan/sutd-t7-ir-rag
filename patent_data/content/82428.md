# Toning apparatus and method.

## Abstract
Electrostatic copying method and apparatus wherein a looped electrophotographic belt 14 having an electrostatic latent charge image formed on the exterior surface of a photoconductive coating carrier thereby, passes a developing station 60 where a toning roller 68 dipping into a sump picks up toner and rolls same onto the latent image as the belt passes through the toning station. The toning roller 68 is caused to protrude into the belt loop effecting the wrapping of the belt around a peripheral segment of the toning roller. The invention also provides a transfer station whereat the developed image may be pressure transferred to a receptor 108 , such as plain paper.
