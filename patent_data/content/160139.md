## Description
DISPENSING CONTAINER FOR LIQUID PRODUCTS The invention relates to liquid containers and particularly to squeeze type containers having means to dispense the liquid product when squeezed. Applicant s own United States Patent 4,324,249 is believed to represent the most pertinent art. This patent discloses a liquid dispenser comprising a squeeze bottle with an opening formed in the underside of the squeeze bottle, a chamber defining an air pocket in an upper portion of the chamber, a liquid passageway connecting a lower portion of the chamber with the interior of the bottle and a liquid outlet connecting the air pocket to the external atmosphere. The liquid outlet structure shown in the patent is located at the bottom of or below the squeeze bottle when the latter is oriented with the opening in the squeeze bottle at the underside of the squeeze bottle.Such structure is believed to represent a marked advance over other types of squeeze bottles and particularly for those applications where it is desired to dispense the liquid product at the bottom of or below the squeeze bottle and through attached auxiliary dispensing structure not forming part of the bottle itself as illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3 of the patent. However, the liquid dispenser of applicant s prior patent is not adapted to dispense through a sidewall of the bottle with reference to another wall on which the bottle normally rests during use. Providing a practical sidewall dispensing squeeze bottle is recognized by applicant in the present invention as meeting another commercially significant need. In other respects, the squeeze bottle structure of applicant s prior patent is best adapted to liquids of relatively low viscosity. Thus, it would be deisrable to have a sidewall dispensing device adapted to dispense liquids of relatively high as well as low viscosity.In one further respect, it would be desirable to locate the air pocket chamber completely within the bottle and to make the chamber of relatively thin walls to minimize material as compared to the external, relatively thick wall air pocket chambers shown in Figs. 2 and 3 of the patent. Another squeeze type container adapted to dispense from the bottom of the container is described in FrenchPatent Application 7832818 Publication No. 2442195 toDe Sancy. This French publication discloses a deformable container for dispensing liquid, the container having a closure cap in threaded engagement with a neck of the container, a cupola shaped structure within the container and an outlet tube extending through the cap into the interior of the cupola shaped structure, at least one opening being provided in the bottom of the latter to allow liquid in the container to flow into the cupolashaped structure, the outlet tube extending from an air space above the liquid in the cupola shaped structure. From the description given, it would appear that the dispensing structure described in the French reference would have relatively limited adaptability to operate without dripping in the event of wide temperature fluctuations such as in personal bathrooms, showers, and the like, and would also have limited application to a relatively wide viscosity range for the liquid products being contained and dispensed. United States 3,157,319 to Schwienbacher discloses another bottom dispensing device for dispensing an easily dripping liquid. The Schwienbacher device comprises a resiliently deformable container with a discharge opening arranged in the bottom of the container, a hood associated with the bottom of the container, with an opening for allowing liquid in the interior of the container to flow past the bottom of the hood into the interior of the hood, and an outlet tube extending from an air space in the hood through the bottom of the container. While not concerned with either a squeeze type bottle or a bottom type dispensing structure, reference is made to United States Patent 1,216,361 to M.S. Reynolds as representing another prior art reference in which an outer noncompressible liquid container mounts an inner container with the two containers being in liquid communication. In use, an antiseptic solution is placed in the outer container and a medicinal liquid is placed in the inner container. Air is supplied under pressure through a first tube into the antiseptic solution and passes through a second tube from the outer container to the inner container after being purified by the antiseptic solution to cause a portion of the liquid to be displaced from the inner container through a third, outlet tube extending through a removable cap at the top of the apparatus. Another common practice, particularly for detergent dispensers, has been to use a flexible walled container, i.e., a squeeze bottle, with a slidable valve at the top of the container which can be moved in and out to close and open the container and when opened provides a means for dispensing the detergent through the valve. Fliptype valves in caps threadably or otherwise secured to the top of flexible wall.containers have also been known and are moved between open and closed positions by pivoting the valve. Additionally, it has also been well known to mount pumps of various kinds in the top of the container to pump a liquid product out at the top of the container through a pump opening. However, any kind of pump structure introduces substantial expense to the overall container package. Taking applicant s prior Patent 4,324,349 and all other prior art known to applicant into account, the art has not provided a compressible type liquid container with means to dispense through a sidewall of the container as contrasted to dispensing through the top or bottom of the container and in a manner which minimizes fouling of the outlet, adapts to a wide variety of product viscosities, adapts to wide temperature variations, and does not promote dripping from the outlet when the outlet is open and the bottle is not being compressed and even though subjected to substantial environmental temperature changes. The present invention is based on an appreciation of the fact that, in a liquid container having a structure defining a chamber within the container and an outlet providing Communication between an air space in the chamber and the exterior of the container, it is not necessary to provide an outlet at the bottom or beneath the container but that, on the contrary, the outlet can be provided through a sidewall of the container in order to enable the discharge or outflow of the liquid, or in some cases the vapor of the liquid, from the chamber through the sidewall of the container. Thus, for example, in the packaging of liquid consumer products, for example, liquid soap, it is in some cases advantageous to provide a container which can be operated to discharge the product laterally from the container and at a position which can readily be visually observed by the user of the container. The drawings illustrate three basic forms or embodiments of the invention. In one embodiment as illustrated in Figs. 1, 2 and 11, the air pocket chamber is disposed opposite the bottom wall and is surrounded by liquid. In asecond embodiment as illustrated in Figs. 3, 4 and 12, a sidewall forms part of the air pocket chamber.In a third embodiment as illustrated in Figs. 5 10, the air pocket chamber is formed by a tubular structure inserted through an opening in the sidewall. Making more specific reference to the drawings Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic representation of a compressible container and discharge means there for according to one form of the first embodiment of the invention Fig. 2 is a diagrammatic representation of a modification of the Fig. 1 construction Fig. 3 is a diagrammatic representation of a compressible container with a sidewall forming part of the air pocket chamber according to a second embodiment of the invention Fig. 4 is a cross sectional view taken in the direction of line 4 4 of Fig. 3 Figs. 5 and 6 are diagrammatic representations of a compressible container and discharge means according to the third embodiment of the invention with Fig. 5 illustrating the container in a filling position and Fig.6 in a dispensing position Figs. 7 and 8 are diagrammatic representations of a compressible container and discharge means as a modification of the third embodiment of the invention with Fig. 7 illustrating the container in a filling position and Fig. 8 illustrating the container in a dispensing position Figs. 9 and 10 are diagrammatic representations of a container and discharge means according to a further modification of the third embodiment of the invention withFig. 9 representing the container in a filling position and Fig. 10 in a dispensing position Fig. 11 is a diagrammatic representation of a container and discharge means according to a further modification of the first embodiment and Fig. 12 is a diagrammatic representation of a modification of the second embodiment in which, likeFig. 3, a sidewall forms part of the air pocket chamber. With reference to Fig. 1, there is diagrammatically illustrated a container 20 in the body of which is a liquid 22 such as liquid soap, shaving cream, detergent, or the like, and which extends up to a level 24. An air space V 2 is left above the liquid level 24 as the product is consumed. An air pocket V l is formed by an inner container 32 provided within the body of container 20 and overlying a portion of the bottom wall 38 on which container 20 normally rests. This can be achieved by blow inoulding the container 20 around the container 32.Free conmuntcation between the interior of the container 20 and the container 32 is provided by means of slots 35 or other openings. Alternatively, container 32 can simply be mounted with its bottom open end spaced a predetermined distance above the inside surface of bottom wall 38. Protruding outwardly and upwardly through the sidewall 40 and sealed thereto is an outlet passage in the form of a conduit 30 with the inlet end 34 of the outlet conduit 30 serving to enclose and communicate with the upper end of the inner container 32. The body of container 20 is substantially sealed apart from the outlet conduit 30. Container 20 may be formed entirely of a compressible material or as illustrated in Fig. 1 may be essentially rigid except for a compressible portion 42. A cap 44 may be used to close the outer discharge opening 45 of outlet 30 if desired. When a liquid substance is contained in the container 20 and the container is disposed upright as shown in Fig. 1, with the outlet conduit 30 extending outwardly and upwardly therefrom, the pocket of air V l is formed in the inner container 32 and with cap 44 removed, such pocket communicates through the outlet conduit 30 with the outside atmospheric pressure. Liquid enters the inner container 32 to a level 36 while at the same time leaving the pocket of air V 1 in the inner container 32 and outlet 30. Level 36 will be determined by the partial vacuum in space V 2, the specific design configuration, the specific gravity of the product, the atmospheric pressure, and the prevailing temperature.In this condition, any liquid, whether in the outer container 20 or inner container 32 will not escape or drip from the outlet conduit 30 so long as the container 20 is not compressed or otherwise disturbed and even in the presence of relatively wide variation in the environmental temperature or atmospheric pressure.The cap 44 is thus not necessary to prevent escape or dripping of the fluid under normal operation conditions of temperature and atmospheric pressure changes. Outlet conduit can be made as large as required to suit the nature and liquid and operating conditions to prevent run out or dripping. In order to discharge material from the container through the outlet conduit 30, the pressure P in the space V 2 above the liquid level must be increased by some suitable means. In the case where the container 20 is a resiliently sided, flexible bottle, this pressure increase can be achieved merely by squeezing.Alternatively, as illustrated in Fig. 1 a compressible portion 42 can be compressed to achieve the same effect.No lifting of the bottle is required in either case.By whatever means the pressure P is increased, the liquid level 24 tends to fall and the liquid level 36 in the inner container 32 will tend to rise. As the pressureP increases, the level 36 eventually rises to the level of the discharge port 45 of the outlet 30 and liquid starts to discharge through the outlet 30. When pressure in space V 2 is relieved, for example, by releasing the compressible portion 42 or in the event of having a resiliently sided, flexible bottle, by releasing the squeeze on the bottle, pressure P will be less than outside atmospheric pressure and consequently air will be sucked in through conduit 30, through the air pocket V l, to bubble up through the liquid 22 to restore the pressure in the space V 2.The return of air through conduit 30 together with the effect of gravity on the fluid by reason of the slope of conduit 30, causes any excess liquid to return to the inner container below the space V l. The upwardly and outwardly sloping conduit 30 thus communicates with the air chamber V l and is, in effect, an outlet structure over inner container 32 and thus provides a practical pressure actuated, side discharge container. Also to be noted is that when container 20 is simply resting on bottom wall 38 as,for example, when containing a hand lotion or similar substance and resting in a bathroom, there will be no tendency for such substance to drip or otherwise leak from the outward port 45 even when cap 44 is not installed and even though there may be relatively wide variations in temperature in the room. Thus, by suitable design, the volume V l between the liquid level 36 and the discharge outlet 45 can be arranged so as to withstand risk of drip, leakage, or the like, and without requiring the use of a cap 44 over the discharge opening 45. A modification of the Fig. 1 embodiment is illustrated in Fig. 2 in which container 50 is formed with a flexible sidewall 52, a cap 54 for filling the container with the desired liquid product 57, an inner container 56 and innerconnected outlet 58 with suitable holes 68 or other openings to allow free transmission between the liquid in outer container 50 and inner container 56.Container 50 is furthermore formed in its lower portion with a confining structure 62 so as to provide, in effect, A ccJnstrictim well around the bottom of inner container 56 to facilitate emptying the product once it is near empty. In other respects, it will be understood that by squeezing the flexible wall 52 the pressure P will be developed in volume V 2 so as to cause the level 64 to rise until the desired discharge takes place through the outlet port 66. Another practical embodiment is diagrammatically illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4 in which there is shown a flexible wall container 70 with a top cap 72 for filling the container and with the internally formed sloping bottom wall 74 to facilitate final emptying of the contents of container 70. Another inner formed vertical wall structure 76 spans the container internally and in conjunction with a suitably formed outer sidewall structure 78 establishes the space V l in Fig. 3. Wall structure 76 is also placed so as to assist in employing the container particularly when near empty. Openings 80, slots or the like are provided to communicate the liquid 82 in the outer container 70 with the liquid 84 below volume V l in Fig. 3. A schematically illustrated, flip type closure 86 is arranged to pivot on the side of container 70 and when closed and not in use to rest against the wall 78.Thus, when the flip type closure 86 is raised as in Fig. 3 the outside atmosphere is communicated with the space V l in Fig. 3 through channel 88. This container is made by locating the flip type closure 86 in the mold and forming the container 70 around it. Thus, it will be understood from prior description that when container 70 is compressed, the level of liquid 84 below space V l will rise and as sufficient pressure is applied, the fluid will be discharged through channel 88 in whatever quantity is desired. As the liquid 82 in the outer container reaches a near empty condition, the sloping wall 74 and barrier wall 76 will enhance discharge of essentially all of the contents of the container.As pressure is relieved on container 70, atmospheric air will be drawn back into the container 70 through channel 88, will bubble through liquid 82, all of which takes place rapidly enabling the user to restore the closure 86 to its nested position. Figs. 5 10 are next described all of which are noted as being basically related to a third embodiment of the invention in which the container is designed to be filled with the container in what might be referred to as a vertical position and to be discharged with the container rotated 90 degrees to what can be referred to as a side dispensing position. A further characteristic of those forms of the invention illustrated in Figs. 5 10 is that a cap, valve, discharge conduit and air chamber structure are all designed such that they can be formed as an integral unit separate and apart from the outer container for installation either at the factory of by the consumer.Thus, by comparison, it will be noted that in Figs. 1 4 and 11 12, later described, the air chamber and discharge structure are formed as part of the conatiner structure and are thus fixed in position at the time of manufacture. Referring initially to Fig. 5, a flexible wall container 90 during filling utilizes a removable capdischarge structure 92 such that the liquid 94 can be admitted through the opening 96. Structure 92 includes the cap 98 and on this a schematically illustrated fliptype closure 1QO which communicates with a tube 102.Tube 102 in use, as in Fig. 6 establishes the volume V l and caunicates with the channel 104 in closure 100.As best seen in Fig. 6, the lower intake end of tube 102 is raised a predetermined distance above the sloping wall 106 such that the liquid 94 in container 90 seeks a predetermined level in the space 110 below volume V l allowing discharge of the liquid 108 through channel 104 when closure lQO is open and the compressible walls of container 90 are compressed with the sloping wall 106 facilitating emptying of the content. As a variation on the construction illustrated inFigs. 5 and 6, there is again somewhat diagrammatically illustrated a flexible wall container 120 in Figs. 7 and 8 with Fig. 7 representing a filling position and Fig. 8 an operating dispensing position. In the embodiment illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8 tube 122 forming part of the cap, closure and outlet structure 124 is made flexible and is positioned by means of an internallyformed guide baffle 126. Structure 124 thus can be entirely removed as illustrated by a somewhat similar embodiment in Fig. 9 and the liquid 130 admitted to the desired level 132 after which the snap on cap 134 forming part of the structure 124 can be applied and at the same time the flexible tube 122 guided into position with the flip type closure 140 remaining closed at this stage as illustrated in Fig. 7.In use, the container is then brought to the position shown in Fig. 8 adapted for dispensing through the sidewall 144 through channel 142 of closure 140 with the sloping wall 148 facilitating emptying of the contents of container 120. Figs. 9 and 10 illustrate a further variation in which the flexible wall container 160 is filled with the liquid contents 162 and the container is sealed by means of the removable cap 164. Cap 164 can be a snap on cap, puncture type cap, or the like. There is also shipped with the container 160 the structure 166 comprising a snap on cap 168, a schematically illustrated flip type closure 170, and a discharge outlet tube 172 with the structure 166 being mounted in use as illustrated inFig. 10 and with the container 160 resting on bottom wall 174 for discharge through sidewall 176.The lower end of tube 172 is raised above bottom wall 174 as illustrated in Fig. 10 to facilitate free communication of the liquid 162 between the outer container 176 and the inner container established by tube 172 and surrounding the space V 1. When container 176 is pressed, the liquid contents will thus be discharged through channel 178 and after use atmospheric air is automatically drawn back through channel 17 8 through space V l and bubbles through the remaining liquid 162 into the space V 2 shown in Fig. 10. In the nodification of the first embodiment illustrated in Fig. 11, a flexible walled container 200 uses a removable cap 202 for purposes of being filled with liquid 204. An inner bell type container 206 either has its lower open end raised above the bottom wall 208 or as intended to be illustrated in Fig. 11 is provided with suitable openings 210 so as to communicate the liquid 204 in the outer container 200 with the liquid 212 confined in the inner container 206. An adjustable outlet tube 220 mounts in a surrounding outlet structure 222 sealed to container 200.Tube 220 can be raised and lowered in the liquid bath 212 within the inner container 206. In use, positioning of tube 220 effectively controls the level at which liquid enters tube 220 and thus allows the amount of squeeze required on the flexible wall container 200 to be correlated with the position of tube 220. Furthermore, accommodation to temperature variations can be made simply by adjusting the position of tube 220 in or out dependent on whether the temperature is increasing or decreasing. Additionally, by adding graduations on tube 220, as indicated in Fig. 11, container 200 can be designed as.a unit dispensing system for a given pressure change. Fig. 12, like Fig. 3, illustrates a construction in which the container 225 is effectively pinched during molding along pinch lines 226, 227 in the manner in which handles are formed on plastic bottles and so as to form the internal air pocket space V l utilizing the outer sidewall 230 as part of the air pocket chamber. In the same molding operation, an outlet 235 is formed and which may receive a cap, not shown, in addition to the filling cap 236. Fig. 12 thus represents an extremely simple sidewall dispensing construction according to the invention. While not illustrated, it is, of course, recognized that any of the outlet arrangements could be arranged with appropriate orifices so as to induce a spray effect with selected liquids such as perfumes, deodorizers, and the like, if desired. The invention containers can also be squeezed when suspended. In all embodiments it will thus be appreciated that there has been provided a novel type dispensing container in which the liquid contents can he dispensed without lifting the container and through the sidewall as contrasted to lifting the container and dispensing through the top or bottom wall of the container as in the referenced prior art. Additionally, it can be noted that each of the embodiments provides the inner air spaceV l with the level of the liquid below space V l being controlled by the partial vacuum V 2 established in all embodiments with the container sealed except for the outlet. The sidewall outlet in any of the several forms described can thus be open but nevertheless with appropriate design will not drip or leak in spite of wide variations in temperature so long as the container is not disturbed.All embodiments furthermore provide the advantage of inherently guiding any excess fluid back into the space below the volume V l whenever the compression is released by the user. Thus, there is in effect a self cleaning action each time the container is employed. It will be appreciated that a cap is not essential to permit filling of the container. Liguid could be inserted through an opening during manufacture which is then sealed or the container could be filled in an inverted position, or any other position, the opening sealed and the container then righted. Other advantages achieved by all of the embodiments include the fact that the discharge structure can be mounted within the container so as to minimize leakage and also the fact that any of the illustrated sidewall discharge arrangements can be substantially varied in size so as to accommodate to either small or wide temperature variations according to the specific design of the practical embodiment utilizing the invention.Additionally, the various embodiments readily lend themselves to being made in a variety of shapes by high production techniques and are adapted to be transported without leakage and over long distances between the point of manufacture and the point of sale and with a range of liquids of varying viscosity. In all of the illustrated examples of the invention, the air pocket chambers are formed within the container and are adapted to being formed as relatively thin wall chambers and with minimum use of material. It will therefore be appreciated that in its broadest form thepresent invention provides a liquid dispenser having a container for containing a liquid reservoir and a dispensing chamber within the container, the dispensing chamber having an outlet through the sidewall of the container. More particularly the present invention provides a liquid dispenser which when operable comprises a container holding a body of liquid surmounted by a first air body at partial vacuum pressure, a re entrant outlet in a sidewall of the container extending into the container towards the floor thereof, said outlet holding a portion of said liquid body surmounted by a second air body at atmospheric pressure, wherein the container is at least partially resiliently deformable to enable variation of the partial vacuum pressure of the first air body whereby to dispense liquid from the outlet.
