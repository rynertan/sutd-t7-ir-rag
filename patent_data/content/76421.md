# FILTERING DEVICE

## Abstract
A filtering device comprising an inlet 8 and an outlet 9 for the liquid filtered and an outlet 10 for the filtrate, the filtration being arranged to take place in two chambers 2,3 connected in series, which consist at least partly of mem brane material through which the filtration is taking place. The device is intended primarily to be used in connec tion with the medical treatment of blood and here in particular in connection with haemofiltration or plasmafers, in which methods a thickening of the blood and consequent ly a pressure drop occurs. The characteristic feature of the invention is a pressure controlled overflow valve 10 arranged between the inlet 8 and the outlet 9 for the liquid filtered.
