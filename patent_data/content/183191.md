## Description
THIENYLTHIAZOLE COMPOUNDS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates to novel and therapeutically valuable thienylthiazole compounds, methods of preparing said compounds and a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one of said compounds Description of the Prior Prt Peptic ulcer is caused by various factors, especially by loss of balance between aggressive factors such as gastric juice and defensive factors such as resistance of gastric mucosa. Histamine H2 receptor blockers represented by cimetidine exhibit inhibitory activity on such aggressive factors, namely inhibit the gastric secretion by specifically binding with the histamine receptor on cellular membrane on gastric wall. Recently, famotidine, l amino 3 2 guanidino 4 thiazolylmethylthio propylidene sulfamide, has been developed as a new histamine H2 receptor blocker. On the other hand, prostaglandins are known to potentiate the defensive factors and be useful as cytoprotective antiulcer agents, since they suppress gastric acid secretion and, in lower doses, have specific protective effects on gastric mucosa against many stimuli. Under these circumstances, compounds having both aggresive factor inhibitory activity and defensive factor potentiating activity have been desired. U.S. Patent No. 4307106 and the corresponding JapanesePatent Application Kokai No. 160369 79 disclose a series of 2 aralkylaminothiazoles having anti inflammatory and immune regulant activity. Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. 35186 83 discloses dicarboxyaminothiazole derivatives having immunocontrolling activity. European Patent bplication Noi 100018 discloses the production of 2 N,N di substituted aminothiazoles which are useful as intermediates for dyestuffs.
