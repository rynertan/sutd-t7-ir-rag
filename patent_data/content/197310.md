## Description
CATALYST COMPONENTS FOR POLYMERIZING OLEFINS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to a transition metal or solid component of a Ziegler type catalyst, which has a high activity and provides a polymer excellent in polymer properties. Hitherto, it has been known that a highly active catalyst can be obtained by using, as a carrier of transition metal compounds such as titanium compounds, a complex of a magnesium compound such as a magnesium halide, a magnesium oxyhalide, a dialkylmagnesium, an alkylmagnesium halide, a magnesium alkoxide or a dialkylmagnesium with an organoaluminum.Numbers of such inventions have been proposed. According to these prior art, the polymers produced by using such catalyst do not have satisfactory polymer properties, although the activity itself of the catalyst is considerably high. Thus, improvement of the catalyst has been desired. Polymer properties are significantly important in slurry polymerization, gas phase polymerization and the like.When polymer properties are poor, the polymer is apt to adhere to a polymerization tank, is difficult to be taken out of the polymerization tank, and the like.Moreover, the concentration of a polymer in a poly merizationvesselhas a close relation with the polymer properties thereof. When the polymer properties are poor, the concentration of the polymer in the tank cannot be raised. It is very disadvantageous in view of inductrial production that polymer concentraion cannot be increased to a high value. In addition, according to many prior processes for producing catalyst components, a large amount of transition metal components are used. Thus, the processes are inferior in the so called unit of transition metal components , which is extremely inconvenient in producing a catalyst. Namely, it is necessary to remove from a catalyst component a large amount of transition metal components which are not included in the catalyst component. Thus, large amounts of solvents and the like are needed, which result in increasing the production cost of the catalyst. Moreover, it is also necessary to subject unnecessary transition metal components to decomposition treatment. In the decomposition treatment, there often occurs generation of halogen gases, hydrogen halides, etc., which is quite undesirable in view of environmental polution.Thus, it has been desired to increase the production unit of transition metal components. Most of the above mentioned highly active catalysts exhibit a decay type polymerization velocity pattern in comparison with conventional noncarrier type catalysts. Namely, in the attenuation type polymerization, polymerization velocity is high at the starting of polymerization and then decreases with the progress of. polymerization. Such polymerization pattern causes various problems with respect to stabilization of polymerization, decrease of activity in a long period polymerization and the like. Thus, it has been desired to develop a catalyst which has a high activity and exhibits a polymerization velocity pattern other than attenuation type.Prior Art In Japanese Patent Publication No. 37195 1976, there is proposed a method for reacting a magnesium halide or the like with a titanium tetraalkoxide and then with an organoaluminum halide In Japanese Laidopen Patent Specification No. 16393 1979 Gazette, there is proposed a method for reacting magnesium halides and then reacting a halogen containing compound with a reducing compound. In the case where an olefin such as ethylene is polymerized by using a catalyst produced according to these methods, the resulting polymer is not satisfactory in polymer properties although the catalyst exhibits a certain degree of activity. On the other hand, Ziegler type catalysts are well known as a catalyst for stereoregular polymerization of olefins. It is also well known that various methods are proposed to further improve the activity and stereoregulating property thereof. Of these various improved methods, a method which brings about remarkable effects particularly in improvement of activity comprises introducing a magnesium compound to a solid component JapanesePatent Publication Nos. 12105 1964, 41676 1972 and 46269 1972 . However, it is also known that in the case where an olefin such as propylene is. polymerized by using a catalyst produced by these methods, the stereoregularity of the resulting polymer is markedly lowered to substantially lose the practical value thereof as a catalyst for stereoregular polymerization of olefins although the catalyst exhibits a very high activity value. Thus, various methods are proposed for increasing stereoregularity of the polymer produced by polymerizing an olefin by using a Ziegler type catalyst which contains a magnesium compound Japanese Laidopen Patent Specification Nos. 9842 1972, 126590 1975, 57789 1976, etc. . These methods are commonly characterized in that an electron donor such as an ester or an amine is further added to a solid catalyst component which contains a titanium compound and a magnesium halogen compound. On the other hand, there are also known methods in which a silicon compound, an alcohol or the like is added as a third additive to a solid catalyst components in addition to an electron donor. Japanese Laid open Patent Specification Nos. 108385 1975, 100596 1977, and 104593 1977, etc. . By these methods, the activity of a catalyst and the stereoregularity of the resulting polymer are considerably improved. However, the steps of decatalyzation from the resulting polymer and extraction of amorphous polymer cannot be avoided. Moreover, the resulting polymer is not satisfactory in polymer properties. Furthermore, holding of the catalyst activity as mentioned above is not sufficient. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to solve the above described problems, which object can be achieved by using a transition metal catalyst component prepared in a specified manner. Thus, the catalyst component for polymerizing olefins according to the present invention comprises a contact product of the following components A1 , A2 and A3 Component A1 a contact product of, as essential componnets, a magnesium dihalide, a titanium tetraalkoxide and or a polymer thereof, and a polymeric silicone compound having the structure represents by the formula EMI4.1 wherein R denotes a hydrocarbon residue , Component A2 an acid halide compound, and Component A3 a liquid titanium compound component a and or a halogenosilicon compound component b , provided that the component a contains a halogen when the component a is used alone. By using, as a transition metal component of a Ziegler catalyst, the solid catalyst component according to the present invention for polymerization of an olefin, there can be obtained a polymer having high activity and excellent polymer properties. For example, with respect to bulk specific gravity of polymer which is one of the measures of polymer propertis, there can be obtained a polymer having a bulk specific gravity of 0.40 g cc or more and, in some cases, a polymer having 0.45 g cc or more. Another advantage brought about by using the solid catalyst component according to the invention is that polymerization velocity pattern can be controlled.Generally, if polymerization is conducted by using a highly active catalyst, there is often observed an attenuation type polymerization wherein the activity is high at the initial stage of the polymerization and thereafter decreases. Such attenuation type polymerization is not preferred because the function of the catalyst sometimes can not be fully exhibit under some polymerization conditions. By using the solid catalyst component according to the present invention, the activity at the initial polymerization stage can be suitably depressed to conduct the so called holding type polymerization.
