# Plastic bag with venting perforations, closed plastic bag with venting perforations containing filler material and a plastic foil for forming such a bag.

## Abstract
A plastic bag 1 of polyolefin material such as polyethylene, for packaging materials, comprising particles of less than 50 µm, and a closed bag containing such materials and a foil material for such a bag. The foil wall of the bag is provided with venting apertures 3 with smooth edges, obtained by laser radiation, having a smallest size of 50 to 100 µm the distance between the venting perfora tions is such that the tensile strength of the foil is substantially the same as the tensile strength of the similar non perforated foil. In a low density polyethylene foil of a thickness of 130 to 190 µm the distance between the perforations 3 of 80 µm is more than 20 mm, in a linear low density polyethylene foil of about 50 to 110 µm the perforation distance is at least 5 mm. The bag may consist of two perforated foil layers, 2, 4 the perforations 3, 3 being staggered with respect to each other.
