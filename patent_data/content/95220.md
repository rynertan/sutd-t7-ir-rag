# Apparatus and process for transferring xerographic images.

## Abstract
For producing a transfer image on an image receiving sheet 65, 66 held on the peripheral surface of a rotating drum 24 a photoconductor sheet 17 bearing on its bottom surface an electrostatic charge image developed by a liquid toner is suspended by its margins from a conveying means 18 . The conveying means is guided past the drum 24 at a level such that the unattached central part of the photocon ductor sheet 17 , which is free to sag relative to its margins, becomes supported at the image transfer zone, out of contact with the image receiving sheet 65,66 , by the liquid toner.
