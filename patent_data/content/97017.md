# PRODUCTION OF METAL FLAKE

## Abstract
In making metal flake powder by wet ball milling a powder of the metal e.g. nickel or stainless steel in the presence of a lubricant in a mobile liquid system, the use of an organometallic substituted alcohol as the lubricant gives flake having improved reflectivity and or electrical conductivity. The lubricant is prefer ably a titanate, e.g. isopropyl tri dioctylpyrophosphato titanate.
