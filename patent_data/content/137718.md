More preferred are compounds wherein at least one of X1 andY1 and at least one of X2 and Y2 are F. Specifically preferred is the compound a,a bis 4 fluorophenyl ss methyl 1H 1,2,4 triazole 1 ethanol. The compounds of the present invention are also useful as intermediates for the production of the fungicidal compounds taught in our EP Aof even date herewith, claiming priority from our U.S.Application Serial No. 529,626, filed 6 September 1983. Detailed DescriPtion of the InventionSynthesis The Formula I compounds of this invention can be prepared by reacting either compounds of Formula II orFormula III with triazole potassium salt EMI3.1 wherein X Cl. Br or I and X1, X2, Y1. and Y2 are as defined above.Lithium and sodium triazole salts may also be used.Approximately equimolar amounts of the reagents are used with the triazole salt often taken in excess of theory. In addition, triazole itself can be used if an acid acceptor is added. Suitable acceptors include alkali metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide or potassium tert butoxide, inorganic bases such as potassium carbonate or sodium hydride. tertiary amines such as triethylamine and excess triazole. When the acid acceptor is a good nucleophile, such as sodium methoxide, an excess should be avoided to prevent undesired side reactions. Suitable solvents include protic solvents such as ethanol or ethylene glycol polar. aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulk oxide or acetonitrile ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or l,2 dimethoxyethane and ketones such as 2 butanone.Addition of a suitable phase transfer catalyst such as a crown ether may enhance the reaction rate. Non polar solvents, for example aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, may also be used if a suitable phase transfer catalyst such as tetrabutylammonium bromide is added. The reaction temperature can vary between 0 and 2000. preferably between 25 and 100 . The reactions can be conducted under elevated pressure. but it is generally preferable to operate at atmospheric pressure. The optimum temperature and reaction time will vary with the concentration and choice of reagents, and especially with the choice of solvent. The intermediate compounds of general Formula II can be prepared by oxidation of compounds of FormulaIV using methods set out in the literature EMI4.1 wherein X1. Y1, X2 and Y2 are as defined above. Suitable reagents which can effect this oxidation include peracids such as peracetic acid, m chloroperbenzoic acid or E nitroperbenzoic acid hydroperoxides such as tert butylhydroperoxide in the presence of an appropriate metal catalyst such as molybdenum hexacarbonyl or hydrogen peroxide in combination with a nitrile such as acetonitrile or with an isocyanate such as phenyl isocyanate. Alternatively. the transformation of Formula IV compounds into Formula II compounds can be effected by first forming the halohydrin with hypochlorous acid or hypobromous acid and then reacting the intermediate halohydrin with a proton acceptor such as potassium tert butoxide. sodium hydroxide or sodium hydride. The intermediate compounds of general Formula IV may be prepared from compounds of general Formula V X1, X2, Y1 and Y2 are as defined previously by standard literature dehydration conditions. For example, reacting the appropriate Formula V compound with thionyl chloride in pyridine as solvent effects conversion to Formula IV compounds,EMI5.1 The intermediate Formula IV compounds may also be prepared by reaction of benzophenone compounds ofFormula VI, wherein X1, Y1, Z2 and Y2 are as defined above. with triphenylphosphine ethylide. EMI6.1 Suitable solvents for this reaction include ether solvents such as tetrahydrofuran or ethyl ether. The triphenylphosphine ethylide is generated from an ethyltriphenylphosphonium halide bromide, chloride or iodide and a strong base such as butyllithium, potassium hydride or potassium tert butoxide. The temperature of the reaction may range from 100 to 30 C depending on the solvent and on the strong base. Compounds of Formula V can be prepared. in turn.by reacting the appropriate benzophenone compound ofFormula VI. wherein X1, Y1, Z2 and Y2 are as defined previously, with an ethylmagnesium halide, wherein Z is a halogen atom, preferably C1, Br, or I.or with ethyllithium.EMI6.2 This reaction is conducted in an ether solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran at a temperature of between 0 600C for the Grignard reagent and 700 30 C for the lithium reagent. In a second method for the preparation ofFormula V compounds, the appropriate propiophenone compound of general Formula VII can be reacted with the appropriate Grignard reagent M MgZ or lithium reagent M Li VIII wherein X1. X2. Y1. Y2 andZ are defined as previously described.EMI7.1 The Grignard reactions are run in an ether solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran at temperatures of between 0 60 C. depending on the identity of the Grignard reagent and the solvent. The lithium reactions are also run in an ether solvent at temperatures of between 100 to OOC. Intermediate compounds of general Formula III can be prepared by reacting a Grignard reagent VIII with a compound of general Formula IX wherein Xi. X2, yl. Y2, X and Z are as defined above EMI7.2 This reaction is run in an ether solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran at a temperature of between 0 60 C. depending on the identity of theGrignard reagent and the solvent. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the preparation of the triazole compounds of this invention can produce a mixture of two triazole isomers.the 1H 1.2.4 triazol 1 yl compound and the 4H l.2.4 triazol 4 yl compound. Since the former isomer will be the predominant one, Formula I is drawn to depict its structure. and the compounds will be referred to as the iH,lyl triazoles. It is to be recognized, however, that the 4H,4y1 isomer can be present, and since this isomer is also fungicidally active, no separation of the isomers is necessary after preparation of the compounds. It will be further recognized that the Formula I compounds can contain one or two asymmetric carbon atoms. The stereoisomers that can result all have fungicidal activity, and separation of these isomers is not required. In the following examples, abbreviations for nuclear magnetic resonance NMR spectra are as follows s singlet d doublet, t triplet q quartet and m multiplet. Peak positions for NMR are reported as parts per million downfield from the internal tetramethylsilane standard. Infrared IR peak positions are reported in reciprocal centimeters cm . Also, unless otherwise stated, ether refers to diethyl ether.

Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from as little as one up to several hundred liters or more per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about 1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 5 to 99 solid or liquid inert diluent s .More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Percent by Weight Active Inqredient Diluent s Surfactant s Wettable Powders 20 90 0 74 1 10Oil Suspensions, 5 50 40 95 0 15Emulsions, Solutions, including EmulsifiableConcentrates Aqueous Suspensions 10 50 40 84 1 20Dusts 1 25 70 99 0 5Granules and Pellets 1 95 5 99 0 15High Strength 90 99 0 10 0 2Compositions Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course. be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound.

Co., Inc.,New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foam, corrosion. microbiological growth. etc. Preferably. ingredients should be approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the use intended. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example. Littler, U.S. Patent 3.060.084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J.

Utility The compounds of this invention are useful as plant disease control agents. They are effective in controlling a broad spectrum of plant diseases, particularly foliar pathogens of ornamental, vegetable.field, cereal and fruit crops, such as, Puccinia recondita. Erysiphe graminis. Bipolaris oryzae, Venturia inaequalis. Sphaerotheca fuliainea, Cercosporidium Personatum Monilinia fructicola, and soil borne pathogens. such as Rhizoctonia solani, Helminthosporium sativum, and Thielaviopsis basicola. Disease control is ordinarily accomplished by applying an effective amount of the compound, normally as part of a formulation containing it, either pre or post infection to the portion of the plant to be protected. such as the roots, stems, foliage, fruit, seeds1 tubers or bulbs, or to the medium soil or sand in which the plants to be protected are grow ing. The compound may also be applied to the seed from which the plants to be protected are to be grown. Rates of application for these compounds can be influenced by many factors of the environment and should be determined under actual use conditions.Foliage can normally be protected when treated at a rate of from less than 1 to 500 grams of active ingredient per hectare. Plants growing in soil treated at a concentration from 0.1 to about 20 kg ha can be protected from disease. Seed and seedlings can normally be protected when seed is treated at a rate of from 0.06 to about 3 grams per kilogram of seed.
