# OPTICAL FIBRE TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS

## Abstract
An optical fibre 3 which radiates power along its length extends in an overhead path in an office or control room. Information coupled into one end of the fibre from a main frame computer 1 , for example, is radiated into free space within the office or control room, and can be received by mobile 2,2ยน and other terminals 4,5,6 therewithin via detectors mounted on the terminals, provided the terminals are within range of the fibre. Non passive terminals 4,5,6 may communicate with one another, passive terminals 2,2ยน or the main frame computer 1 via the radiating fibre 3 if they are connected by optical links and bi directional cou plers to the radiating fibre 3 . Various suitable designs of leaky optical fibre 3 are described.
