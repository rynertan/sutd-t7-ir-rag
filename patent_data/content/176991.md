# Composition and method for corrosion inhibition.

## Abstract
A corrosion inhibiting composition and method of in hibiting corrosion on metal surfaces are described. The composition comprises a reaction product of a a first constituent selected from an epoxide having an average of at least about one vicinal epoxide per molecule and a halogen ated aliphatic compound having at least one displaceable halogen and b a second constituent comprising a dimer captan. The reaction product in a hydrocarbon diluent is an effective corrosion inhibitor when applied to metal surfaces in highly corrosive environments, and is designed particular ly for downhole metal surfaces of oil drilling equipment.
