# IMPROVEMENTS IN SELECTOR DEVICES

## Abstract
An electronic selector device has a control box 11 with conducting plates 13 22 secured to the inside of a window 12 in a building. Touching of the glass 12 , or a conducting touch pad 23 32 on the outside of the window 12 causes a change in capacitance at that point, and an electronic pulse provided by a clock 40 is thereby delayed, causing trigger ing of a latch 61, 62 and consequent control of a display 10 or like apparatus.
