# Video game system.

## Abstract
A system, method and station intertace arrangement which permits video games to be played over a telephone line is disclosed. Communications delay between the games can be mitigated by transmitting local player position data to a remote game, the position data being detected at a local game during a current generation but the position data not being used by the local and remote games until the next generation and the transmission occurring during the time interval in which the current generation is being run at the local game. The position data can be encoded so that errors, e.g. transmission errors, may be detected. Detected errors may be corrected by retransmitting the priorly transmitted local position data. In addition, the games may be synchronized or resynchronized by transmitting a frame count along with the position data. The frame count may identify by order of succession the respective local and remote position data so that the games obtain and remain synchronized.
