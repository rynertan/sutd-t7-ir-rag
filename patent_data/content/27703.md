# Axial gap squirrel cage induction electric motor.

## Abstract
The stator 21 of the motor is of annular form, with generally radial slots 22 which receive the energising wind ings. The squirrel cage of the rotor has a magnetic component 16 and a conductive component comprising inner ring 10 and outer ring 12 joined by bars 14 . The bars 14 are curved so as to follow a path with a higher radial component at the inner end than at the outer end. This reduces perceived noise by avoiding sharp registering of the rotor bars with the stator slots, and also by providing a more uniform ratio of magnetic to conductive material in the rotor at different radii around the rotor axis.
