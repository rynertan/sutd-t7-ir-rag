# Steering gear and method of assembling such gear.

## Abstract
A steering gear and a method of assembling such a gear. A rotatable rack bar 1 having helical rack teeth 5 is displaceable along axis 2 by rotation of a pinion. The end of the bar 1 is connected to a tie rod 6 having a ball end 7 forming a universal joint in housing 8 . A skirt 14 of the housing 8 encloses a roller thrust bearing 9 to which it is secured by peening or rolling a hem part 14a of the skirt over an outer race member 17 of the thrust bearing. A thrust plate 15 is interposed between a plug 12 and the thrust bearing 9 . Upon deformation of the hem part 14a to clamp the thrust bearing to the hous ing 8 , the plug 12 is displaced into its bore against the ball end 7 to provide desired preloading for the ball joint. The inner race member 19 is secured to a shaft part 20 of the rack bar 1 .
