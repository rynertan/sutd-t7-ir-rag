# Ring laser gyroscopes.

## Abstract
A ring laser gyroscope having a plurality of sensitive axes X, Y, Z and hence a plurality of cavities 7X, 7Y, 7Z , the cavities lying in mutually orthogonal planes at right angles to the respective sensitive axes and each cavity having three or more corners arranged so that at least one corner coincides with a corner of another cavity, whereby the cavities are inter connected, the gyroscope further comprising a plurality of mirrors 17,18 disposed respectively at the coinciding cor ners and the remaining corners of the cavities 7X, 7Y, 7Z , whereby the number of mirrors is less than the total number of cavity corners, the mirrors at the coinciding cavity corners and the coinciding cavities being oriented such that the nor mal to each of these mirrors lies in the plane of each cavity it serves and bisects the associated corners of those cavities.
