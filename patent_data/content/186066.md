## Description
The present invention relates to the structural gene of glucoamylase derived from a fungus of Cloning of glucoamylase genes from Glucoamylase EC 3.2.1.3 is an enzyme that hydrolyzes the α 1,4 glucoside chain progressively from the non reducing terminal end. This enzyme also hydrolyzes the α 1,6 glucoside chain. Glucoamylase is secreted from fungi of the genera J. Biochem. 92, 1623 1633 1982 describes that glucoamylase produced by Rhizopus sp has been purified and characterized. One problem with the production of EP 126 206 describes host organisms transformed with a glucoamylase cDNA sequence obtained from the genus Aspergillus. Glucoamylase from Aspergillus differs, however, remarkably in its amino acid sequence from glucoamylase obtained from the genus Rhizopus. One object of the present invention is to realize a method of production of glucoamylase that is inexpensive and is suitable for manufacturing alcohol. Another object of the present invention is to provide a glucoamylase gene, derived from a fungus of A further object of the present invention is to provide a vector comprising said gene, and a microorganism such as yeast transformed by such vector, particularly a transformed microorganism that can be cultured in a liquid medium A still further object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing a The present inventors have for the first time isolated a glucoamylase gene from a fungus of the genus The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of these findings. A fungus of Rhizopus oryzae that is capable of producing glucoamylase is used in the present invention for obtaining the desired gene. The present inventors have confirmed that The present strain SAM0034 has the following mycological properties. Colonies on Potato dextrose agar medium attaining a diameter of 5 5.5 mm in one day at 28 C and covering 90 mm petri plates of Potato dextrose agar medium in two days, white. Stolons hyaline or yellowish brown rhizoids brown. Sporangiophores usually arising from rhizoids, occasionally arising directly from stolons, either single or in groups, occasionally divided, 220 1200 µm long. Sporangia globose or subglobose, dark brown, 60 150 µm in diameter columellae globose or subglobose. Sporangiospores globose, subglobose, or angular, striatae on the surface, 5 15 x 3 7 µm. Chlamydospores subglobose or cylindrical, 6 13 x 4 19 µm. The present strain SAM0034 can be accommodated in the fungus genus The mycological properties of the present strain SAM0034 were compared with those of the known species of the genus Rhizopus, referring to Inui, T., Y. Takeda H. Iizuka, 1965. Taxonomical Studies on Genus Rhizopus Journal of General and Applied Microbiology, Vol. 11, Supplement, 121 pp. Zycha, H., R. Siepmann G. Linnemann, 1969. Mucorales.

London . The result of this comparison revealed that the present strain could be identified as The glucoamylase gene of the present invention has the nucleotide sequence shown in the brackets in Fig. 1. The glucoamylase gene may be isolated in the form of cDNA prepared from the mRNA of Usually it is not easy to obtain the complete glucoamylase gene by the former method, while the gene obtained by the latter method usually contains intron sequences and thus cannot be expressed in host The scope of the glucoamylase gene of the present invention involves not only the same nucleotide sequence coding for the bracketed amino acid sequence in Fig. 1 but also a nucleotide sequence corresponding to an amino acid sequence having an enzymatic activity comparable to that of the bracketed amino acids. The Therefore, if a signal sequence coding for the following amino acid sequence is combined with a DNA fragment coding for a suitable proteinaceous substance e.g. interferons, lymphokines and interleukine 2 in a DNA expression vector and if this vector is used to transform a suitable host, the desired proteinaceous substance can be excreted extracellularly. A method that can be used with advantage for the purpose of isolating the glucoamylase gene shown above is described hereunder. The whole DNA is separated from a glucoamylase producing fungus of the genus The gene of the present invention can be incorporated in a suitable plasmid vector and have been expressed in a host microorganism such as yeast or In order that the glucoamylase gene is expressed in a microorganism, it is preferred that a promoter and or a tail 3 non translational area suitable for that microorganism is used see Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application No. 146281 1983 . For example, in order to have the glucoamylase gene expressed in a yeast, the promoter region P The present invention is hereunder described in greater detail with reference to the following examples.
