# Electrostatic air cleaners.

## Abstract
A shorting and test mechanism for an electrostatic air cleaner uses an electrically conductive spring element 10 at tached to an access door 2 to the air cleaner whereby an opening movement of the door effects a motion of the spring to contact the high voltage electrode support assembly 30 to 34 to discharge any residual electrical charge on the high vol tage assembly to ground. Conversely, the closing of the access door forces the spring away from the high voltage elec trode assembly to permit a normal operation of the air cleaner. The spring is further connected to an electrically insulating test button 8 located in an opening in the access door to enable an operator by depressing the push button to move the spring toward the high voltage electrode assembly whereby to test for the existence of the high voltage on the electrode assembly by providing an electrical arc path to ground through the spring.
