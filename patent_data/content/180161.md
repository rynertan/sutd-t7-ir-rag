# PORTABLE OXYGEN SENSOR WITH SHORTENED BREAK IN TIME

## Abstract
An improved oxygen sensor is provided which gives oxy gen concentration readings immediately and without the un certain delays of a break in period. The break in period is de creased substantially by imparting to a copper counter elec rode 24 a uniform distribution of cuprous oxide throughout its structure. More reliable performance of the sensor is achieved.
