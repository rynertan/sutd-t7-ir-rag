# Process for producing oligoesters.

## Abstract
A process for producing an oligoester which comprises a the step of reacting isophthalic acid and propylene oxide in a reaction medium in the presence of a specific catalyst comprising a tetraalkyl ammonium compound to prepare an oligoester, and b the step of removing volatile components from the resulting oligoester by heating the oligoester at a tempera ture of 180 280 C is disclosed. The oligoester is used as an intermediate for preparing unsaturated polyesters.
