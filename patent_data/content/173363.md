# MR apparatus having a transmission measuring coil for high frequencies.

## Abstract
For increasing the sensitivity of an MR apparatus when measuring comparatively high frequencies, the ratio frequency excitation measurement coil 10, 30 is divided into two individual symmetrically drivable and readable coil halves 32, 34 , respec tively. The mutual connection of central connections of the coil halves can be realised by means of a balun 54 but for this purpose any other symmetrical form of coupling, for example using a strip line transformer 70 or suitably dimensioned coaxial cables 60, 62 may alternatively be used.
