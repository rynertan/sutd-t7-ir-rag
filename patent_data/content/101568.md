# STRUCTURE FOR ATTACHING CARPETING TO VEHICLE BODY

## Abstract
A structure for attaching carpeting 9 to a vehicle body comprises a carpet support member 16 fixedly supported between an upper edge of a side sill panel 2 and a floor panel 1 . The support member 16 has a sawtooth edged cutout 18 along one edge at a point opposite the pillar defined by a pillar inner member 4 and a pillar outer member 5 , these members being fixed to the side sill panel 3 , and a pillar garnish 10 , the lower end 10a of which has a substantially trapezoidal shape and which is mounted on the pillar so as to compress the floor carpet 9 against the deformable sawteeth 19 of the carpet support member 16 .
