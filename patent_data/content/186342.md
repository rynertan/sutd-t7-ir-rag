# Method of and apparatus for spraying coating material.

## Abstract
A conical sheath of air emitted from a vortex plenum 18 adjacent the outer edge 15 of a rotating head 14 spray apparatus 10 is effective to optionally help atomize the liquid coating material, and to carry the atomized material forwardly toward a confluence on the axis 36 of the rotating head where tubulent mixing of the particles occurs, and the particles are sprayed forwardly for deposition in a uniform thickness film of a uniform population mix of particles sizes. Forward air and tangential air components are admitted from the vortex plenum and are independently controlled so that different spray characteristics are obtained, the tangen tial air providing a swirl moment to the conical sheath of air which enlarges the diametrical size of the deposited film pattern. The forward velocity determines the atomization ability of the conical sheath of air and the particle velocity in the spray pattern. Electrostatic and non electrostatic opera tions are intended.
