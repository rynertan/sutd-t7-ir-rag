## Description
The invention relates to three dimensional articles consolidated from alloys which have been rapidly solidi fied from the melt. In particular, the invention relates to articles which have been consolidated from rapidly solidified alloys and have increased strength, hardness and ductility. USP 4,297,135 to Giessen, et al. discloses alloys of iron, cobalt, nickel and chromium containing both metalloids and refractory metals. The alloys are rapidly solidified at cooling rates of 10⁵ 10⁷ C sec to produce an ultrafine grained metastable crystal structure having enhanced compositional homogeneity. Heat treatment converts the metastable, brittle alloys into ductile alloys with primary grains of ultrafine size which contain an ultrafine dispersion of boride as well as carbide and or silicide particles. The powders or ribbons can be consolidated into bulk parts, and the heat treated alloys possess good mechanical properties, in particular high strength and hardness, as well as good corrosion resistance for selected compositions. USP 4,381,943 to J. Dickson, et al. discloses a chemically homogeneous, microcrystalline powder for deposition onto a substrate. The powder is a boron containing alloy based in Fe, Ni, Co or a combination thereof. M. Von Heimendal, et al. in the article The Activation Energies of Crystallization in the Amorphous Alloy METGLAS 2826A , USP 4,439,236 to R. Ray discloses boron containing transition metal alloys based on one or more of iron, cobalt and nickel. The alloys contain at least two metal components and are composed of ultra fine grains of a primary solid solution phase randomly interspersed with particles of complex borides. The complex borides are predominately located at the junctions of at least three grains of the primary solid solution phase. The ultra fine grains of the primary solid solution phase can have an average diameter, measured in their longest dimension, of less than about 3 micrometers, and the complex boride particles can have an average particle size, measured in their largest dimension, of less than about 1 micrometer, as viewed on a microphotograph of an electron microscope. To make the alloys taught by Ray, a melt of the desired composition is rapidly solidified to produce ribbon, wire, filament, flake or powder having an amorphous structure. The amorphous alloy is then heated to a temperature ranging from about 0.6 0.95 of the solidus temperature measured in C and above the crystallization temperature to crystallize the alloy and produce the desired microstructure. The amorphous alloy ribbon, wire, filament, flake or powder taught by Ray is consolidated under simultaneous application of pressure and heat at temperatures ranging from about 0.6 0.95 of the solidus temperature. The following documents disclose the consolidation of amorphous alloys at a pressing temperature below the alloy crystallization temperature to produce amorphous metal compacts which are, however, brittle and to produce claddings U.S.P. 4,503,085 to Dickson, et al. discloses amorphous alloy powders that are capable of being heated and deposited on a substrate to form a bonded, amorphous alloy layer. Other boron containing transition metal alloys have been conventionally cooled from the liquid to the solid crystalline state. Such alloys can form continuous net works of complex boride precipitates at the crystalline grain boundaries. These networks can decrease the strength and ductility of the alloy. Powders of rapidly solidified, transition metal alloys have previously been processed by conventional powder metallurgy to produce compacted crystalline alloy articles. Indeed, the ability of the powders to be processed by such techniques has been one of the advantages cited for such alloys and powders. Conventional processing, however, limits the properties attainable with these alloys because it exposes the alloys to excessively high temperatures that can greatly diminish the advantages of the rapid solidification. If during conventional processing the alloy is not exposed to high temperatures, then incomplete interparticle bonding can occur, resulting in a material with low toughness and, in the extreme case, low strength. Conventional techniques have not been capable of producing the desired consolidation and bonding while retaining the fine microstructure afforded by rapid solidification. As a result, the consolidated articles do not have desired levels of hardness, strength, and toughness. The present invention provides a method for con solidating rapidly solidified, transition metal alloys. The method includes the step of selecting a rapidly solidified alloy which is at least 50 glassy. The alloy is formed into a plurality of alloy bodies, and the alloy bodies are compacted at a pressing temperature of not more than about 0.6 Ts solidus temperature measured in C to consolidate and bond the alloy bodies together into a glassy metal compact having a density of at least about 90 T.D. The compacted glassy alloy bodies are heat treated at a heat treatment temperature ranging from about 0.55 0.85 Ts and above the alloy crystallization temperature Tx for a time sufficient to produce a fine grain crystalline alloy structure in the compacted article. The invention further provides a consolidated arti cle with increased strength and toughness. The article is composed of a crystalline, transition metal alloy consisting essentially of the formula M The improved method of the invention distinctively processes rapidly solidified glassy metal alloys to produce crystalline alloy particles having an advantageous combination of strength and toughness desired for various structural applications. The method distinctively consolidates and bonds the alloy particles together while they are in the amorphous state, and then heat treats the compacted glassy metal article to crystallize the alloy and form a very fine grained structure. As a result, there can be more flexibility during manufacturing and more precise control of the formation of precipitates within the consolidated article. Consolidated articles produced from the alloys are substantially free of continuous networks of precipitates and are well bonded. Such articles are particularly useful for dies, machine tooling, and the like. The invention will be more fully understood and further advantages will become apparent when reference is made to the following detailed description and accom panying drawings in which In accordance with the present invention, a rapidly solidified alloy, which is at least about 50 glassy, is formed into a plurality of alloy bodies. The alloy bodies are compacted together to form a glassy metal compact which has a density of at least about 90 T.D. theoretical density . The compacted, glassy metal alloy is then heat treated at a temperature which ranges from about 0.55 0.85 Ts solidus temperature in C and which is above the alloy crystallization temperature Tx . This heat treatment continues for a time sufficient to produce a desired fine grain crystalline alloy structure within the consolidated article. Alloys that can be employed in the practice of the present invention consist essentially of the formula M Tungsten, molybdenum, niobium, and tantalum increase physical properties such as strength and hard ness, and improve thermal stability, oxidation resis tance and corrosion resistance in the consolidated product. The amount of these elements should be limited to less than about 40 at. because it is difficult to fully melt alloys with compositions greater than the stated amounts and still maintain the homogeneous nature of the alloy. The elements aluminum and titanium promote a pre cipitation hardening phase. The volume fraction of the hardening precipitates, however, should be limited to avoid the formation of networks. Chromium provides strength and corrosion resistance, and the amount of the chronium is limited to control the melting temperature of the alloys. Boron and carbon provide the borides and carbides that promote hardening in the consolidated alloy. The lower limit for d assures sufficient boron and carbon to produce the required borides and carbides. The upper limit assures that continuous networks of the borides and carbides will not form. Phosphorus and silicon help promote the formation of a glassy amorphous structure in the alloy, and aid in assuring a homogeneous alloy after casting. Silicon is further preferred because it helps provide corrosion resistance in the alloy and forms silicide precipitates. Alloys are prepared by rapidly solidifying a melt of the desired composition at a quench rate of at least about 10⁵ C per second, employing metal alloy quenching techniques well known to the rapid solidification art see for example, USP 4,142,571 to Narasimhan, which is hereby incorporated by reference thereto. Sufficiently rapid quenching conditions produce a homogeneous, glassy material. In the glassy material, there is no long range order. X ray diffraction patterns of glassy metal alloys show only a diffuse halo, similar to that observed for inorganic oxide glasses. Such glassy alloys must be at least 50 glassy, preferably are at least 80 glassy and more preferably are substantially 100 glassy, as determined by X ray diffraction analysis, to attain desired physical properties. Glassy alloy bodies, such as filament, strip, flake or powder consisting essentially of the alloy compositions described above, can be consolidated into amorphous three dimensional consolidated articles. In a particular aspect of the invention, however, the alloy bodies are consolidated by dynamic compaction, such as a high speed punch. The dynamic compaction with the high speed punch should include a compaction velocity ranging from about 100 2000 m s and preferably includes a compaction velocity ranging from about 600 2000 m s. The dynamic compaction technique provides compaction with a shock wave that operates primarily on the surfaces of the alloy bodies e.g. powder particles . This raises the temperature of the surfaces enough to produce strong interparticle welding. However, since the duration of the temperature rise is very short, there is no significant crystallization of the alloy. The compacted glassy metal article has a density of at least about 90 T.D. theoretical density , preferably has a density of at least about 95 T.D. and more preferably has a density of about 100 T.D. In another aspect of the invention, the alloy bodies are warm consolidated at a pressing temperature, which is not more than about 0.6 Ts solidus temperature measured in C . In further aspects of the invention, the pressing temperature ranges from about 0.6 1.1 T The warm consolidation takes advantage of the softening and decrease in the resistance to flow which occurs in glassy metal alloys at elevated temperatures that are below the alloy crystallization temperature. In particular amorphous alloys, this softening is evidenced by a distinct glass transition temperature Tg in other alloys this Tg is not a well defined temperature. In either case, the relative softening of the glassy alloy allows a more effective compaction and bonding between the alloy bodies. The ease and degree of the interparticle bonding is significantly greater than that afforded when the alloy is crystallized prior to or during the consolidation bonding process. The compacted alloy bodies are heat treated at a heat treatment temperature ranging from about 0.55 0.85 Ts for a time period sufficient to produce a crystalline alloy having increased hardness and toughness. Where the glassy alloy has been warm consolidated, the glassy metal compact may be hot formed during the heat treatment process to increase the interparticle bonding and or increase the densification of the final crystalline alloy article. This hot forming may, for example, be provided by extrusion, forging or the like. The heat treated consolidated articles of the invention have a distinctive microstructure composed of very fine grains of a crystalline matrix having an average grain diameter of less than about 2 micro meters. The heat treated crystalline alloy may be substantially free of metalloid e.g. B, C, Si, P precipitates. In such case, the constituent amounts of boron, carbon, silicon and or phosphorous are held unprecipitated in a solid solution phase. The heat treated crystalline alloy may also contain precipitates composed of one or more metalloid compounds selected from the group consisting of borides, carbides, silicides and phosphides. When such precipitates are present, they form a substantially uniform dispersion of very fine, separated particles that have a maximum particle size of not more than 4 micrometers. Preferably, the maximum size of the particles is less than about 2 micrometers, more preferably is less than about 1 micrometer, and most preferably is less than about 0.5 micrometer. The grain sizes and precipitate particle sizes can be measured by viewing a microphotograph. Whether or not a consolidated article contains metalloid precipitates, a preferred embodiment of the article includes, admixed and consolidated in the article, at least one additional crystalline alloy selected from the same formula M Fig. 1 shows a scanning electron micrograph of an article of the present invention having the composition Ni The following Examples are presented to provide a more complete understanding of the invention. The specific techniques, conditions, materials, proportions and reported data set forth to illustrate the principles and practice of the invention are exemplary and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. A Ni Samples were heat treated by placing them in a vacuum furnace for ½ hour at several temperatures. It was surprisingly found that their hardness, HRC Rockwell C hardness , could be increased above that of the as compacted amorphous solid. These data were confirmed in further tests. In addition it was found that time at temperature was important, as shown in Table II These specimens had 0.5 to 1 residual porosity consolidation at higher impact velocities to produce full densification would be expected to produce still higher hardness values. Even so, the hardness values obtained are significantly above those obtained by conventional processing of this alloy. Conventional consolidation has involved HIPing at 1100 C for 4 hours and has given a hardness of 46 to 48 HRC which can be raised to around 49 HRC by aging at 800 C. The advantages of the low temperature heat treatment of dynamic compacts were confirmed by subjecting specimens previously heat treated at several different temperatures to an aging treatment, Table III. The structure of the dynamically compacted and heat treated specimens was not resolvable by optical microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy showed that a specimen heat treated at 950 C for 1 hour contained very fine borides see Fig. 1 . These borides were less than 1 micrometer in size and were significantly finer than borides found in standard conventional material. Surprisingly, these fine borides were very uniformly dispersed and had a substantially spherical shape rather than the angular polygonal or rectangular shapes of the borides in the conventional material. Thus, when borides are precipitated by the heat treatment of the present invention, they are significantly different than previously reported borides. However, the physical metallurgy of this alloy indicates that while crystallization occurs for this alloy around 540 C, it is not until around 750 C 0.59 Ts that precipitation of the borides occurs. Therefore, specimens heat treated below 750 C would remain single phase with no borides present. Thus, amorphous alloys may be advantageously consolidated in the amorphous state and then heat treated to give a desired microstructure. A 12.7 mm wide ribbon of alloy Ni₆₀Mo₃₀B₁₀ was cast by planar flow casting on to a rotating wheel to produce an amorphous ribbon. For this alloy Ts is about 1260 C, and Tx is about 550 C. The ribbon was cut into short samples which were heat treated for a period of 1 hour in a standard furnace under argon. The resultant Vickers microhardness Hv values of the heat treated specimens were measured, and are set forth in Table IV The heat treated alloy increased in hardness compared to the as cast amorphous alloy, and there was approximately a doubling of the hardness compared to crystalline alloys produced at a conventional processing temperature of 1100 C. These observations can be correlated with our understanding of the physical metallurgy of this alloy, which is very similar to that of the Ni Dynamic compaction produces a high density amorphous compact which has a high as compacted strength. It requires however special equipment. Other alternative ways of consolidating the amorphous powders were therefore investigated. One possibility was found to be warm pressing the powder at a temperature below the crystallization temperature of the alloy. This capitalizes on the significant softening of the amorphous alloy that occurs as the crystallization temperature is approached and is illustrated in Fig. 4, which shows hot hardness data for a dynamically compacted billet of alloy Fe₇₈Si₁₃B₉. Warm pressing requires the use of high pressures and may not produce as strong or as well bonded a compact as is produced by dynamic compaction. As a result, the heat treatment stage may be required to increase the interparticle bonding. This may necessitate the use of a higher heat treatment temperature, or the use of a hot pressing or forging operation to increase the interparticle bonding and perform the heat treatment. To explore this technique, glassy compacts were made of the alloy Fe₇₈B₁₃Si₉, which has a Ts of about 1110 C and a Tx of about 550 C. A range of pressing pressures, temperatures and times at pressure was employed. Using a pressure of 1035 MPa and a duration of 15 min at 400 C, a 96 T.D. compact was produced pressing at 460 to 470 C 0.85 0.87 Tx produced a 99 T.D. compact, while pressing at 500 C 0.93 Tx produced a 99 T.D. density compact in which some of the alloy had crystallized. In general, increasing one variable allowed the other two to be decreased pressures above 1035 MPa and temperatures between 460 C and 500 C would allow a decrease in the compacting time. Times of 2 5 min. readily allowed compaction to over 98 T.D., and it was found that 10 or less crystallization of the compact was not detrimental. Amorphous compacts produced by this technique were investigated by a variety of tests. Samples were, for instance, heat treated at several temperatures and their microhardness and microstructure determined. A small increase in hardness was observed, as shown in Table V, especially around the crystallization temperature of this alloy about 540 C . Boride precipitation followed crystallization with this alloy. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that not only are those very high hardness values for such a simple iron based alloy, but also the microstructures are extremely fine for an alloy which contains no refractory alloy additions, such as W, Mo, Co, etc. Exposure of an iron based alloy without these refractory alloy additions to even a moderately high temperature is known to result in rapid deterioration. Even hot working tool steels, which are highly alloyed with such alloy additions cannot ordinarily be exposed to temperatures over 600 C without incurring significant, permanent softening, which would render the material unusable. The change in microstructure that occurs on heat treating the amorphous compacts and the advantages this can produce in mechanical properties are further illustrated by the hot hardness data for a fully dense amorphous compact of the alloy Fe₇₉B₁₆Si₅, Fig. 5. For this alloy, Ts is about 1150 C and Tx is about 515 C. It can be seen that an increase in hardness occurs at around the crystallization temperature. Due to the long exposure times, crystallization can occur at a lower temperature than that indicated by DSC. It should be observed in Fig. 5 that this increase in hardness is retained on returning to room temperature, even after a second exposure to the hot hardness test. Conventional tool steels exposed to the hot hardness test temperatures would ordinarily exhibit a consistant decrease in room temperature hardness after each retest. Further work on Fe₇₈Si₁₃B₉ investigated the transverse, 3 point bend strength as a function of the heat treatment temperature, Table VI. The increase in the transverse rupture strength T.R.S. indicates an increase in the ductility toughness of the material. The hardness is related to the tensile yield strength, while the rupture or bend strength is related to the tensile strength and ductility. It is important to emphasize that the excellent properties shown in Table VI are a result of first pressing amorphous iron powder at a temperature of 450 C, and then heat treating to form the amorphous compact at a temperature significantly below that conventionally employed for sintering iron powder. This technique attains a high density compact by taking advantage of the softening of the amorphous compact which occurs at temperatures approaching Tx. In addition, the surface activity of the amorphous material at such temperatures is believed to be high. These factors, together with the crystallization of the alloy, promote good interparticle bonding. This is further illustrated in Table VII, which shows in more detail the effect of heat treatment temperature and time on the mechanical properties. Argon was used as the protective gas for the heat treatment. This confirms the previous work and demonstrates that the optimum parameters have not been determined. To optimize the heat treatment, various combinations of air and oil quenching from 800 C and 900 C were carried out with subsequent aging operations at 500 C, 550 C, 580 C, and 600 C. All gave good properties with no significant difference in final properties. A group of different alloys was planar flow cast to produce a 2 or 4 wide amorphous ribbons. These rib bons were then comminuted into 35 mesh 500 micro meters powder. However, one alloy Co The macrohardness of the resultant compacts are given in Table VIII. A somewhat higher value would have been obtained for the cobalt based alloy if greater densification had occurred. The hardnesses of the different alloys are relatively similar. Although the Fe₄₀Ni₄₀Mo₄B₁₈ gave the highest overall hardness, the benefit of this alloy over the much less expensive iron base alloys is small. The most readily available iron base alloys were compared to the cobalt base alloy by hot Rockwell A HRA hardness testing after the alloys had been heat treated at 800 C for 1 hr. The low density of the cobalt base alloy was expected to give it a low room temperature hardness, but it was believed that this compact would still exhibit superior hot hardness because of its cobalt base and the complex nature of its other additions. This was found not to be the case, Table IX. Therefore, for many applications the iron base alloys, particularly those with high boron contents, may be preferred because of their lower cost. The alloy Ni High densities were obtained with Ni Heat treating these compacts at 800 C for 2 hours crystallized the alloy and produced fine borides which were less than 0.5 microns in size and approximately spherical in shape. Heat treatment at lower temperature did not produce borides, as expected from the physical metallurgy of this alloy. Full densification may be achieved by an isothermal forging of the glassy metal compacts at 700 to 900 C. As forging times can be short 1 to 15 min , extremely fine microstructures can be produced. It was even possible to increase the density by 3 93 to 96 T.D. by forging at about the pressing temperature of 470 C. This approach of low temperature consolidation plus heat treatment also allows the production of compacts made from reactive mixtures, which would degrade if exposed to a high temperature. For instance, 20 by volume of fine diamonds were mixed with amorphous Ni Other mixtures have also been made. For example the Fe₇₈B₁₃Si₉ glassy alloy has been mixed with the Ni A 30 by volume addition of the nickel based alloy to the iron based alloy was consolidated into a substantially full density glassy compact, and then heat treated at 800 C for 1 hour. Diffusion between the two different alloys did not occur. The material had a bend strength of 828 MPa and a hardness of 48 HRC. The main advantage of this type of alloy is the improved wear resistance, which can be obtained with as little as 5 by volume addition of the hard Ni alloy phase. Another way of producing an amorphous bulk material is plasma spraying an amorphous powder to form a thin coating on a selected substrate. A suitable plasma spraying technique is described by Dickson et. al., U.S.P. 4,381,943. As indicated in the previous example, increased hardness and toughness can be obtained in these coatings if the amorphous alloys are crystallized by a heat treatment in which borides are not precipitated out or are precipitated out as fine, uniformly distributed spheres. It is, therefore, apparent that the properties of amorphous coatings, expecially of alloys similar to the NiMoB type, could be improved if they were heat treated in the range of 550 900 C. This would also stress relieve the coating and could be significantly improve its bond strength to the base metal. Since heat treatment can improve interparticle bonding, as indicated in Example 3, penetration of the coating by reactive liquids and subsequent corrosion of the base metal could be reduced. The microhardness values of a plasma sprayed coating to NI Having thus described the invention in rather full detail, it will be understood that such details need not be strictly adhered to but that various changes and modification may suggest themselves to one skilled in the art, all falling within the scope of the invention as defined by the subjoined claims.
