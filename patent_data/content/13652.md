# Ultrasonographic process.

## Abstract
The invention concerns an ultrasonographic process wherein a visible image corresponding to a pattern of ultrasonic exposure is formed in a silver halide element. According to this process, an element comprising internally fogged silver halide grains is contacted with a transport liquid in the presence of a solute for example, a silver halide solvent or iodide ions capable of rendering the internally fogged silver halide grains developable in a silver halide developer. The element is then imagewise ultrasonically exposed and developed in a surface developer to produce a visible image defined by the pattern of ultrasonic exposure. The sensitometric curves show that the higher the solute concentration, the better the sensitivity of the element.
