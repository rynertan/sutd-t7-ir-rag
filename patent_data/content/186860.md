# A UNIT FOR MEASUREMENT OF OVERTURNING MOMENT OF A HEAVY WORKING MACHINE, ESPECIALLY A CRANE

## Abstract
The invention solves the problem of a simple unit for de termination of overturning moment of a heavy working ma chine, especially a crane, by utilization of elastic strain of sep arable connections. The unit has an indicator 1 connected with a measuring instrument serving for determination of a total force R. The in dicator 1 is situated perpendicularly to the rotation plane of the crane and lies in the vertical plane of symmetry of the jib and is set at a constant distance of about a 2 from the axis of ro tation of the crane, that is, in the vicinity of rolling elements of the bearing 2 .
