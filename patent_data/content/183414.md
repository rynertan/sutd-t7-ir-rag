# Drive chain belt.

## Abstract
A drive chain belt is fitted around a V type pully 1 with a pair of inclined walls movable toward and away from each other, wherein the chain belt 2 comprises an endless chain which is formed by pivotally connecting a plural number of rows of link members 3,5 by pins 4 , an inner extension 3a, 5a being provided on appropriate number or each of the link members and projecting radially inward of said pully when the chain is fitted thereon. An opening 6 is formed in each one of the inner extension so as to fit V blocks 7 in the openings. The V block has inclined end faces adapted for bringing into engagement with the inclined walls of the V pully to increase the contact area to the inclined walls of the pully, further interference portions 5b are a provided on opposing end faces of the link members in at least one row thereof to prevent outward deflection of the chain belt beyond a predetermined angle.
