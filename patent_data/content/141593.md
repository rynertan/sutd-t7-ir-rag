## Description
SHAMPOO COMPOSITIONS BACKGROUND ART The desire to develop products which simultaneously clean and condition hair has long been present. While the desire has been present1 developing such products has presented innumerable problems. Generally the agents which condition hair best are cationic with one or more long fatty hydrocarbon chains. Hair being negatively charged will allow for the cationic portion to attach to the hair while the long fatty chain s provide for ease of combing and hair conditioning. Cationic materials generally cannot be used with good cleaning anionic surfactants and still deliver good hair condition. This meant that other surfactants such as nonionics, amphoterics and zwitterionics were examined by workers in the field. Many of these efforts are reflected in patents issued in the conditioning shampoo area. U.S. Patent 3,849,398, November 19, 1974 to Hewitt discloses conditioning shampoos containing betaine, cationic and amine oxide surfactants. U.S. Patent 3,697,452, October 10, 1972 to Olson et al discloses shampoo compositions similar to those in Hewitt.Another patent to Hewitt is U.S. Patent 3,755,559, August 28, 1973 disclosing shampoos containing a tertiary amine oxide, a higher alkyl betaine and a soap. U.S. Patent 3,822,312, July 2, 1974 to Sato discloses shampoos containing a quaternary ammonium salt, a betaine and an additional additive. U.S. Patent 3,990,991, November 9, 1976 to Gerstein discloses shampoos containing amphoteric surfactants and quaternary ammoniurn compounds. U.S. Patent 4,080,310, March 21, 1978 to Ng et al discloses shampoos containing an amphoteric surfactant, a cationic resin and having a pH as low as 3. U.S. Patent 4,132,679 January 2, 1979 to Tsutsumi et al discloses shampoos containing a phosphoric acid ester salt and a betaine. U.S.Patent 4,231,903,November 4, 1980 to Lindemann et al discloses shampoos containing a mixture of an amido betaine and a phosphobetaine. U.S.Patent 4,247,548, January 27, 1981 to Barker discloses a conditioning shampoo containing a betaine, a polypropoxylated quaternary ammonium chloride surfactant and gum arabic. U.S.Patent 4,294,728, October 13, 1981 to Vanlerberghe et al discloses shampoos containing a cationic, amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactant and a diol. U.S. Patent 4,329,335, May 11, 1981 to Su et al discloses a shampoo composition containing a betaine, an amine oxide and a polymerized quaternary compound. U.S.Patent 4,181,634, January 1, 1980 to Kennedy et al discloses shampoos containing a betaine and a bisquaternary compound. Ethoxylated amides have been recognized for use in shampoos see E. A. Kraggs, Soap and Chemical Specialties, 40 1964 1, pg. 79. , but not in compositions of the type disclosed and claimed herein. An additional problem faced by formuîators of conditioning shampoos has been achieving formulations which possess good cleaning and conditioning over an extended period of time. This requires that the compositions degrade only minimally over time. While the above described references disclose compositions containing components of the type used in the present compositions, they do not teach or suggest totally satisfactory answers to the questions of good cleaning, conditioning and stability. It is believed that good cleaning with cationic conditioning compounds is in part dependent on limiting the reacting of the quaternary with the fatty acids in sebum. In addition the references fail to teach or suggest composi tions of the type disclosed herein having a pH below 3.75, pref erably in the range of from about 2 to about 3.75. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to pro vide hair conditioning shampoo compositions which provide good cleaning and conditioning. The good cleaning relates to improved sebum emulsification as well as good lather. It is a further object of the present invention to provide shampoo compositions which are stable in terms of providing good cleaning and conditioning over an extended period of time. It is believed that the ethoxylated amide s resistance to hydrolysis contributes to this improved stability. It is still a further object of the present invention to provide compositions which can provide desired viscosities without resorting to additional components to the extent necessary if the preferred essential components are not used. These and other objects will become more apparent from the detailed description which follows. Unless otherwise indicated, all percentages and ratios herein are by weight. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The compositions of the present invention comprise from about 5 to 70 of a zwitterionic surfactant, from about 0.58 to about 10 of a cationic conditioning compound, from about 1.0 to 10 of an ethoxylated amide, preferably the ethoxylated amide has an alkyl group of from 12 to 18 carbon atoms, from about 20 to about 93.5 water and have a pH below about 3.75. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The essential as well as optional components of the present invention are described in detail below.Surfactant The essential surfactants used in the compositions of the present invention are higher alkylamido betaines. The betaines may be represented by the following structural formula EMI3.1 wherein R1 is a long chain alkyl radical having from about 10 to about 18 carbon atoms, R2 and R3 are each alkyl radicals having from about 1 to about 3 carbon atoms, R4 is an alkylene or hydroxy alkylene radical having from about 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, y is an integer from 1 to 4, and X is a carboxylate radical. R1 may be a mixture of long chain alkyl radicals and may contain one or more intermediate linkages or non functional substituents such as hydroxyl or halogen radicals which do not affect the hydrophobic character of the radical. Examples of betaines useful herein include cocamidopropyldimethyl carboxymethyl betaine, laurylamidopropyldimethylcarboxymethyl betaine among many others.In many instances the dimethylcarboxymethyl part of the designation is not included. Mixtures of the betaines are also acceptable. The amount of surfactant is from about 5 to about 705, preferably from about 10 to about 258. Cationic Conditioning Compound The second essential component of the present invention is a cationic conditioning compound, preferably a quaternary ammonium salt, a imidazolinium salt or mixtures of one or both. Quaternary ammonium salts can have the formula EMI4.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen, an aliphatic group of from about 1 to 22 carbon atoms, or an aromatic, aryl or alkaryl group having from about 6 to 20 carbon atoms R2 is an aliphatic group having from about 12 to 22 carbon atoms R3 and R4 are each alkyl groups having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms and X is an anion selected from halogen, acetate, phosphate, nitrate and methyl sulfate radicals. Preferred quaternary ammonium salts are the dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides, wherein the alkyl groups have from 12 to 22 carbon atoms and are derived from long chain fatty acids, such as tallow or hydrogenated tallow. The term tallow refers to fatty alkyl groups derived from tallow fatty acids. Such fatty acids give rise to quaternary compounds where R1 and R2 have predominately from 16 to 18 carbon atoms. Representative examples of quaternary ammonium salts useful in this invention include ditallowdimethylammonium chloride, ditallowdimethylammonium methyl sulfate, dihexadecyl dimethylammonium chloride, di hydrogenated tallow dimethyl ammonium chloride, dioctadecyldimethylammonium chloride, dieicosy Idimethylammonium chloride, didocosyldimethylammonium chloride, di hydrogenated tallow dimethylammonium acetate, d ihexadecyldiethylammon ium chloride, dihexadecy Idimethylammon i um acetate, dital lowdipropylammonium phosphate, dital lowd imethy I ammonium nitrate, di tcoconut alkyl dimethylammonium chloride cetyltrimethylammonium chloride stearyidimethylbenzylammonium chloride, and myristylalkonium chloride. Other quaternary ammonium salts useful herein are the compounds of the formulaEMI5.1 wherein Rg is an aliphatic group having 16 to 22 carbon atoms and X is an anion as above defined. Tallow propanediamine hydrochloride is an example of this quaternary ammonium salt. Quaternary imidazolinium salts have the formula EMI6.1 wherein R6 is an alkyl group containing from 1 to 4, preferably from 1 to 2 carbon atoms R5 is an alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a hydrogen atom R8 is an alkyl group containing from 1 to 22, preferably at least 15 carbon atoms, or a hydrogen atom R7 is an alkyl group containing from 8 to 22, preferably at least 15, carbon atoms and X is an anion1 preferably chloride. Other suitable anions include those disclosed with reference to the quaternary ammonium salts described hereinbefore. Particularly preferred are those imidazolinium salts in which both R7 and R8 are alkyl of from 12 to 22 carbon atoms, e.g. I methyl l stearoy lamide ethyl 2 heptadecyl 4, 5 dihydroimid azolinium chloride 1 methyl 1 palmitoylamide ethyl 2 octadecyl 4,5 dihydroimidazolinium chloride and 1 methyl I I tallowamide ethyll 2 tallow imidazolinium methyl sulfate. Another imidazoline derivative favored for use in the present compositions is isostearyl ethylimidonium ethosulfate. The cationic conditioning compound is present at a level of from about 0.5 to about 10 , preferably frcm about 1 to about 6 .Ethoxylated Amide The third essential component of the compositions described herein is an ethoxylated amide. These are generally ethoxylated mono and diethanolamides of fatty acids having from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms, preferred are alkyl groups having 12 to 18 carbon atoms. It is also preferred that the amides have only a small percentage, less than about 3 , of alkyl groups at or below C10 in length. The number of ethoxy groups CH2CH2O present in addition to that present in the case of the mono material is from 1 to about 5 while in the case of the di material it is from about 2 to about 4. Such products are commonly identified asPEG X alkylamide such as PEG 3 cocamide or PEG 6 lauramide, preferred materials for use herein. Other suitable alkyl groups include myristyl, cetyl and tallow. Mixtures of amides may also be used.A pre ferred mixture is a 70 30 mix of amides having lauryl and myristyl alkyl groups. pH Adjustment The compositions of the present invention have a pH below about 3.75, preferably in the range of from about 2.0 to about 3.75. The compositions are adjusted to this pH range with an acid buffer. The buffering capability is necessary since the pH of the diluted product approximately 10 1 with water when applied to hair should be near the range given. Suitable buffer solutions can be prepared using for example, agents such as citric acid, phosphoric acid, phthalic acid, glycine or mixtures thereof. In each case the proper buffering capacity is obtained by adjusting the final pH of the compositions to within the pH range indicated above. This may be done by using a strong acid or a strong base e.g., HCI or NaOH as may be needed. The most preferred agent is citric acid.The amount of buffer employed in the present compositions depends on the particular acid chosen but is generally from about 0.38 to about 10 , preferably from about 1 to about 5 . Water Water is the last essential component of the present invention and forms the remainder of the composition. It is generally present at a level of from about 20 to about 93. 5 pre erably from about 65 to about 80 . Optional Components The shampoos herein can contain a variety of non essential optional components suitable for rendering such compositions more stable and desirable. Such conventional optional ingredients are well known to those skilled in the art, e.g., preservatives such as benzyl alcohol, methyl paraben, propyl paraben and imidazolidinyl urea betaine surfactants such as lauryl betaine in an amount up to about equal to the amount of the amidobetaine thickeners and viscosity modifiers such as, sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, C10 C14 alkyl alcohols e.g. lauryl alcohol , and ethyl alcohol suspending agents such as hydrogenated castor oil opacifiers such as ethylene glycol distearate perfumes dyes antidandruff agents such as zinc pyridinethione other conditioning agents such as amino functional silicones and sequestering agents such as disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate. Such agents, except for the betaine surfactants, generally are used individually at a level of from about 0.01 to about 10 .
