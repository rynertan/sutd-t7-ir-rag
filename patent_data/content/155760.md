# A method for coating food products and food coating compositions for carrying out said method.

## Abstract
Frozen food products are coated with a novel coating composition which permits the food product to be reconsti tuted for consumption by the application of microwave energy and obtain the desired combination of textural properties, both of moistness of food substrate and crisp ness of coating. The coating composition comprises three components, namely a predust component applied to the food substrate, a batter component next applied to the food substrate, and finally a breading component. In the coating composition, the components adjacent the food portion coagulate during cooking and retard the migration of moisture from the food portion to the breading component while, at the same time, providing a controlled porosity to the exterior of the coated food substrate to permit migration of moisture and moisture vapour through the coating to the external environment.
