## Description
This invention relates to a method of making feedstock for the formation of articles from fine particles and to the article itself. In the prior art procedures for formation of articles from powdered metals, two distinct approaches have been taken, the older approach being that of press and sinter and the more recent approach being that of molding, debinding and sintering of a thermoplastic feedstock containing small particles or aggregate and a binder. Examples of the latter procedures are set forth in US A 2,939,199, 4,197,118, 4,404,166 and 4,445,936 and CA A 1,177,290. In order to achieve high sinter densities and high sinterability using the more recent technology described above, it has been necessary to utilize fine particles on the order of about 4 µm which have been blended with a thermoplastic binder as the feedstock material. After formation of the green article, the binder was removed and, by well known sintering relationships, the material could achieve a high final fired density with its attendant excellent properties of tensile strength and high elongations. The drawback with the use of fine particles, however, is that they tend to be very expensive as opposed to the much larger diameter particles employed in conventional powder metallurgy of the press and sinter type. It has therefore been an objective in the art to provide feedstock materials that have substantially the same molding and sintering properties as the fine particle feed stock materials, yet which are more comparable in cost to the less expensive large particulate materials used in the press and sinter technology. These large particle size materials cannot presently be used successfuly in the above described more recent technology. The properties of thermoplastic molding feedstock materials are such that, during the green formation phase, the green feedstock material must behave as if it were a well behaved thermoplastic material. It must then be readily debound and must, under conventional sintering practice, be sinterable to high density with a non interconnecting porosity. The final material must have a high elongation and high mechanical properties, generally speaking, better than 90 of the properties of an equivalent forged material. In the prior art, this has been attained by utilizing particles with diameters on the order of 25 of the diffusion length of the various chemical species that are involved in the sintering phenomenon. Efforts have been made to employ larger diameter particles by using the conventional concepts found in ceramic technology and powdered metallurgy of distributing particle sizes to maximize the green feedstock density by classifying the particles so that the smaller particles fit into the interstices of the larger particles. While this approach has demonstrated that a high engineering property material in ceramics and powdered metallurgy can be attained, it has been most successful in those systems in which the entire sintering forces are due to the free surface energy forces on the particles. The prior art densification forces in compact and sinter powder metallurgy are those mechanical forces that collapse the particulate field together by mechanically yielding the particles and in which sintering serves only to weld the particles together. This result is because the particle sizes present in classical powder metallurgical applications cause the particle to particle diffusion field to be far less than the particle diameter. This causes the particles to weld together but does not achieve any substantial densification, i.e., the centers of the particles moving closer to each other by an exchange of material between the particles. When particulate fields with particles that are about 25 of the diffusion length of the active diffusing chemical species are used, especially in metals though not limited to metals, solid state diffusion utilizing only the free surface energy of the particles as a driving force behind diffusion results in very high engineering property materials. This technique is currently being carried out on a commercial basis and is well known in the art as demonstrated in the above noted patents. A drawback to this technique, however, is that the cost of a given weight quantity of powder that has a very fine particle size with a very narrow particle size distribution is very costly when compared to the much larger particle sizes which are utilized in powdered metal technology of the press and sinter or compact and sinter type. The particle sizes that are presently employed for fine metal powders are approximately 4 µm in diameter with a distribution such that there are few particles larger than about 5 µm and few smaller than about 2 µm. Ideally, it is desired to have all particles of exactly the same size, however as one deviates therefrom, the final densities of the final article produced after debinding and sintering become lower and the mechanical properties developed become lower also. In addition, the elongation decreases and the tensile strength decreases. A preferred range for the fine particle aggregate is 4 µm plus or minus about 50 . or less. US A 4,129,444 discloses a feedstock composition comprising a substantial amount of 100 mesh particles at least about half of which are 325 mesh and less than 5 of an organic binder. The 325 mesh material has particle sizes of about 44µm, and the 100 mesh material has particle sizes of about 149µm. The prior art feedstock is further processed by forming into a desired configuration, removing the binder and finally sintering. The high cost of the raw material powder has been a limiting factor in the particulate material technology area of the type described above. Therefore, the present invention provides a homogeneous feedstock composition comprising sinterable fine particles, large particles weldable to said fine particles and a binder, Furthermore, the invention relates to a method of producing an article from a fired particulate feedstock whereby binder is removed from the particulate feedstock prior to firing, comprising the steps of It has been found that large particles may be included in the fine particulate feedstock formulations to an extent that dramatically reduces the overall cost of the feedstock material while minimally affecting its green and sintered properties. A fine particle is defined as follows In a graph where the x axis is c c₀ c A group of large particles can be taken and dispersed into a group of fine powder particles in such a way as to keep the large particles separate from each other, i.e., not touching each other , and to have a continuous fine particle field including binder that surrounds the large particles, where the fine particles are of substantially uniform size as described hereinabove to provide a feedstock material. The feedstock material is formed in the same manner as the 100 fine particle feedstock material of the prior art and, after debinding, can be sintered to a high density with excellent properties of tensile strength, elongation and the like, very similar to that of the 100 fine particle feedstock material. As the size of the particles is reduced, the total free energy per unit volume due to the interfacial energy between particle and binder becomes greater and greater. Depending upon the exact magnitude of this free energy, the volume loading of particles into feedstock systems will progressively decrease with decreased particle size. Hence, a lower level practical limit of fine particle size is reached when the particle size is such that only about 45 by volume of the fine particles can be incorporated into the overall feedstock material, this being the maximum volume loading for this particular system. 55 of the feedstock material will then be binder. This represents the minimum diameter of the particles that can be used in that particular feedstock system. In order to lower the cost of that feedstock system, large particles can be incorporated or dispersed into that system, large particles being those where the particle diameter is greater than the diffusion length thereof. It has been found that if large particles are introduced into a feedstock system which contains a maximum volume loading of fine particles by replacing up to about 60 by volume and preferrably 50 by volume of the fine particles with the same volume of large particles such that there are substantially no large particle to large particle contacts, that the system will behave from a debinderizing and sintering standpoint very nearly as if there were no large particles in the system. The final mechanical properties of this sintered material from the standpoint of elongation and tensile strength are almost equal to the same part made with all fine particles. Upon debinding and sintering, the large particles act substantially as raisins in a pudding with the pudding itself diminishing in size while it is being sintered. The sintering forces at the large particle to small particle interfaces accommodate themselves in such a way that the sintering field is distorted at those points, the large particles retaining their size and the fine particulate field becoming smaller, thereby carrying the larger particles with them. Therefore, the shrinkage of the overall system is substantially the same as with the fine particles alone. It is preferrable to operate at about 50 large particles and 50 combined small particle and binder subsystem by volume. The ability to use more and more fine particles is available, this however increasing the cost of the feedstock system. It is therefore desirable to use the maximum amount of large particles. Since the large particles have a cost substantially less than that of the fine particles, it can be seen that the system using the large particles provides a substantial cost saving over the use of fine particles alone with minimal loss of engineering properties. A preferred large particle is a 325 mesh material which has particle sizes of 44 µm maximum and smaller particles including fine particles with an approximately 30 µm diameter average in the large particle system. The feedstock in accordance with the present invention is formulated by mixing fine particles together with a binder and large particles in the desired amounts. The formulation is heated above the melting point of the total binder system and the formulation is mixed using, for example, a sigma blade mixer until a homogeneous mass is produced. The formulation is then cooled to permit solidification thereof and then broken up into small particles or pellets for feeding into a molding machine or the like. The fine particles are any element, alloy or compound which can be molded and which are or can be made sinterable and include metals, some ceramics and most cermets. The particles are preferably spherical or as near spherical in shape as possible. The above described materials are all well known. The large particles will normally have substantially the same chemical composition as the fine particles or will have a chemical composition preferably such that they will be converted to the chemical composition of the fine particles or vice versa during the article processing steps. Alternatively, the fine particles or both the fine particles and the large particles can be converted to a third chemical composition during the processing steps for formulation of an article. Though it is preferred that the large and fine particles be of the same chemical composition after sintering, the possibility that their chemical composition be different is anticipated herein and made a part of the disclosure. The binder can be of a single component or multiple components with different melting points. Such binder systems and binders are well known in the art and are disclosed in part in the above noted prior art. Crystalline binder materials are preferred. A feedstock for use in the process of forming articles in the above noted patents of Raymond E. Wiech, Jr. was formulated as follows 315 g of substantially spherical nickel particulate material having an average particle size of 4 to 7 µm and a specific surface area of 0.34 m A formulation was made exactly the same as in Example I with exactly the same equipment with the particulate material being changed from nickel to substantially spherical iron of average particle diameter of 4 to 6 µm of substantially spherical shape for the fine particles and 325 mesh iron for the large particles. In this example, 278.19 g of fine particle iron was mixed with 278.19 g of the 325 mesh iron and a binder system the same as in Example I. It is readily apparent from the above that the feedstock system in accordance with the present invention can use approximately half as much binder in the case of the 50 large particle system as compared with prior art systems, thereby providing for decreased requirement of the ultimately disposed of portion of the feedstock system. In addition, since the amount of binder in the system is less than in the prior art system, the period required for debinding of the system can be substantially decreased and thereby provide substantially shorter run times for production of articles from the feedstock. The result of this is that there can be a substantial cost saving, not only in the particulate material system itself, but also in the article production procedures in which the feedstock system is to be utilized.
