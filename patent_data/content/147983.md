# PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ALKYLENE GLYCOLS

## Abstract
Alkylene glycols are prepared by reaction of an alcohol with formaldehyde and an organic peroxide having a formula R O O R¹ where R and R¹ are independently either alkyl or aralkyl groups containing 3 to 12 carbon atoms. The reaction is carried out in the presence of electromagnetic radiation which is able to decompose the organic peroxide. The alcohol used in this process is either methanol, a secondary alcohol or a mixture thereof.
