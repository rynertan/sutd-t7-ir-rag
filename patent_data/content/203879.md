# Functionalized monomers from 1 1 isocyanato 1 methylethyl 3 or 4 1 methylethenyl benzene.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to the preparation of poly merizable monomers that are prepared from 1 1 isocyana to 1 methylethyl 3 1 methylethenyl benzene m TMI and 1 1 isocyanato 1 methylethyl 4 1 methylethenyl benzene p TMI . The monomers prepared from m and p TMI can contain numerous chemical moieties, and when poly merized, produce polymers that have chemically bonded to the polymeric backbone the functional moiety. More specific ally, these TMI derived monomers may contain chain break ing antioxidant moieties, peroxide decomposing antioxidant moieties, ultraviolet stabilizing moieties, triplet quenching moieties, and other chemical moieties that are useful in poly mers.
