# Process for making non woven fabrics.

## Abstract
In a process for making a non woven fabric, fibers, preferably hydrophobic fibers such as polyester or polyolefin fibers are contacted with a binder comprising polymer polymerized from a monomer mixture comprising at least one C₂ C₁₈ alkyl acrylate, C₂ C₁₈ alkyl methacrylate, vinyl aromatic compound, vinyl halide, vinylidene halide, vinyl ester of at least one saturated carboxylic acid, polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid, polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid ester, polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid ester, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, alpha olefin and or diene monomer, the polymer having a molecular weight of from 50,000 to 10,000,000, a glass transition temperature of from 60 C to 40 C, the polymer is substantially free of residual ethylenic unsaturation and monomer units containing photosensitive groups and the binder is substantially free of crosslinking agent and photosensitive compounds. The composition is at least partially dried and exposed to a source of radiation, such as ultraviolet, to cure at least some of the polymer.
