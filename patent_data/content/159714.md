## Description
The invention relates to a line of genetically engineered hamster cells that produce constitutively very large amounts of the human glycoprotein interferon γ. Culture of these cells, designated CHO γ 301, accumulate in the medium in which they are cultivated. This very large production is approximately 500 times higher than was previously obtained with human lymphocytes Yip et al, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, Interferons IFNs are a group of proteins produced by the cells of most vertebrates and characterized by their ability to inhibit the growth of virus cells exposed to these proteins. Interferons are species specific, that is active mainly on cells from the same animal species from which they have been obtained. Thus human cells will be sensitive to human IFNs, but not to most animal IFNs. Human IFNs are classified in three groups IFN A major obstacle to testing the clinical efficacy of IFN γ is the small amount of IFN γ .This was prepared from fresh human peripheral mononuclear cells stimulated by a combination of phorbol myristate and lectins. Such methods can yield only 10 20,000 units IFN γ per ml of culture. Isolation of complementary DNA clones of the human IFN γ mRNA sequence allowed one researcher to produce the protein in However, the natural form of interferon gamma may be obtained from transformed mammalian cells. Haynes and Weissman, Nucleic Acids Res. 11 687 706, 1983 constructed a plasmid bearing the dihydrofolate reductase DHFR gene under the control of the adenovirus major late promoter and a human gamma interferon cDNA gene under the control of the SV40 early promoter. Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells transformed by this plasmid expressed IFN γ at a rate of 20,000 100,000 units.ml ¹.day ¹, in clones selected after exposure to 0.2 or 1.0 micromoles methotrexate. Unamplified CHO cells produced IFN γ at a rate of 10 300 units.ml ¹.day ¹. Scahill, et al., Proc Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 80 4654 58 1983 cotransformed CHO cells with a first plasmid encoding the selectable marker DHFR and a second bearing a human gamma interferon cDNA gene under the control of the SV40 early promoter. CHO clones selected in methotrexate produced 50,000 units per ml. of culture medium. Since the DHFR gene confers resistance to high concentratons of methotrexate, the cotransformed interferon gene is amplified by selection of transformed cells resistant to methotrexate, according to the method of Alt, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 253 1357 70 1978 . See also, Bostock and Tyler Smith, J. Mol. Biol., 153 219 236 1981 Nunberg, et al, PNAS USA , 75 5553 56 1978 . The genomic human interferon gamma gene has been isolated and sequenced, and is thus known to include large intervening sequences introns . Gray and Goeddel, Nature, 298 859 863 1982 . Even though it is recognized that introns may be important in the formation of stable mRNAs, see Prochownik and Orkin, J. Biol. Chem, 259 15386 15392 December 25, 1984 , or may possess enhancer sequences, see Grillies, et al., Cell, 33 717 728 1983 , interferon gamma cDNA has been utilized in the construction of eukaryotic interferon expression vectors. Goeddel and Gray, EP Appl. 77,670 April 27, 1983 publication . While promoters are control elements which are effective only when positioned immediately 5 of the gene to be controlled, enhancers act relatively independently of their distance and orientation with respect to the coding region of the gene. Gruss, DNA 3 1 5 1984 Marx, Science, 221 735 737 19 August 1983 . An enhancer region has been identified in the long terminal repeat LTR of the Harvey Murine Sarcoma virus. Kriegler Botchan, Mol. and Cell. Biol. 3 325 339 1983 . Enhancer sequences may enhance the expression of heterologous genes, but their activity is believed to be host specific and their mechanism of action is uncertain. Gruss, supra. Berg, et al., Mol. and Cell. Biol., 3 1246 54 1983 have examined the effect of the SV40 72 bp repeat and the Murine Harvey Sarcoma virus 73 bp repeat enhancer sequences on the mouse beta globin promoter s control over the transcription of the E. coli galactokinase gene. They found that the SV40 enhancer was stronger in CV 1 primate cells, while the reverse was true in L mouse cells. They also found that the effects of the two enhancers when present on the same DNA was additive.Luciw, et al., Cell, 33 705 716 1983 reported provisional evidence that enhancer promoter combinations functional in one set of experimental conditions may not work in another microinjection v. transfection . Indeed, the findings of Emerman and Temin, Cell, 39 459 467 1984 , suggest that an enhancer may inhibit expression of an exogenous gene under some circumstances. Thus, success in enhancing expression of one exogenous gene does not guarantee success in expressing another. In the present invention, we have been able to obtain CHO cell clones producing constitutively 1,000,000 units ml PER 24 HRS PER 1,000,000 CELLS IFN γ by using the human IFN γ gene containing its large intervening sequences introns instead of the complementary DNA which is a copy of the processed IFN γ mRNA. The presence of introns in the IFN γ gene Gray, Goeddel, Nature We have also been able to enhance expression of the interferon gamma gene by placement of the Harvey Murine Sarcoma Virus enhancer downstream from the SV40 promoter DHFR cDNA unit. Finally, high levels of purification of this interferon were achieved by adsorbtion to monoclonal antibody followed by alkaline elution. One object of the invention is the constitutive production of IFN γ at high rates from nonhuman cells. Another object of the invention is the purification to homogeneity of IFN γ. Another object of the invention is the purification of the IFN γ with minimal inactivation. Another object of the invention is to provide an expression system for the production of IFN γ. Another object of the invention is to utilize a genomic IFN γ gene to express IFN γ in nonhuman cells. Another object of the invention is to utilize a retroviral enhancer sequence, like the HSV sequence, to enhance transcription of an IFN γ gene. Another object of the inventions is to amplify a genomic IFN γ gene by methotrexate selection of cells contransformed with a DHFR gene. A human genomic library in lamda bacteriophage Maniatis, et al., Cell 15, 687 701, 1978 was screened using two synthetic oligonucleotide probes γ1 21 nucleotides complementary to codons 11 through 17 and γ3 27 nucleotides complementary to codons 158 to the last 166th codon . The oligonucleotides were synthesized from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA clone described by Gray et al Nature 295, 503 508, 1982 . One phage clone hybridizing to both oligonucleotides was selected by the procedure of Grunstein and Hogness Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 72, 3961 3965, 1975 as modified by Mory et al Eur.J.Biochem. 120, 197 202, 1981 . This phage γ 6 was found to contain the entire IFN γ gene and to be very similar to phage λ 10 of Gray and Goeddel Nature 298, 859 863, 1982 , but differed from it by having several different restriction sites in the 2 kb region preceding the gene. The entire IFN γ gene with its three large introns, was excised from phage γ 6 DNA as a BamH1 fragment Fig. 1 of 8.6 kb and subcloned in pBR 322 to yield plasmid pγ654 Fig. 2 . A unique Bcl₁ restriction site located in the 5 untranslated region 60 bp upstream from the initiator ATG codon Fig. 1 was used to cleave pγ654. After recutting with BamH1, the 5.6 kb fragment containing the IFN γ gene was isolated and introduced into the expression vector pSVE 42 Fig. 2 . This vector, derived from pSVE3 Hartman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79, 233 237, 1982 contains the origin of SV40 replication and the promoter of the T antigen gene. The Bcl₁ site of IFN γ was fused to the filled in Hind A dihydrofolate reductase deficient mutant DHFR of hamster CHo K1 cells clone DXB11 Urlaub and Chasis, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77, 4216 4220, 1980 was used for DNA mediated co transformation Wigler et al., Cell 16, 777 785, 1979 . As selective marker, we used plasmid DNA pDHFR Δβ derived from pSVDHFR Fig. 3 , which contains the mouse DHFR cDNA fused to the SV40 early gene promoter and to a splicing region of mouse IgG γ2a Horowitz M. and Sharp P. personal communication . About 0.5x10⁶ CHO DHFR cells were exposed to a CaPO₄ DNA coprecipitate prepared by mixing 20 µg of pSVEY121 DNA with 5 µg pDHFR Δβ DNA in 0.45 ml of 0.1 mM Tris HCl pH 7.9 0.1mM EDTA with 0.5 ml of 280 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Na₂HPO₄, 50 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.1, before adding 0.05 ml of 2.5 M CaCl₂ with gentle shaking and allowing precipitation for 30 minutes. The cells were left with the precipitate for 30 minutes at room temperature, then 9 ml of Nutrient mixture F 12 Gibco Company and 10 fetal calf serum FCS were added and the cells incubated at 37 C, in 5 CO₂, for 4 hours. The medium was removed and the cells were osmotically shocked with 10 percent glycerol in F 12 for 4 minutes, then washed and incubated 48 hours with F 12, 10 percent FCS. Cells were then trypsinized and subcultured 1 4 into selective medium composed of Dulbecco s modified Minimum Essential Medium DMEM , 150 µg ml proline and 10 percent FCS which had been extensively dialyzed against phosphate buffered saline to remove free nucleosides. Only cells capable of de novo purine biosynthesis, and hence DHFR , can grow in this selective medium and form colonies. Medium was changed every 3 4 days and clones were isolated after 10 12 days. Eight such DHFR clones were picked up by mild trypsinization in small cylinders grown to mass cultures and tested for the secretion of human IFN γ . The cells were grown in 9 cm diameter plastic dishes with 10 ml medium to a total of about 4x10⁶ cells. Medium was changed every 24 hours and the amount of IFN γ in the medium was assayed by two methods 1 inhibition of the cytopathic effect of Vesicular Stomatitis virus on culture of human amniotic cells WISH exposed overnight to various dilutions of IFN γ , and 2 a double monoclonal antibody radiometric assay for human IFN γ . Both methods are described by Novick et al EMBO J. 2, 1527 1530, 1983 . We found that 2 out of the 8 clones produced 6000 8000 units IFN γ ml 24 hours of IFN γ and 1 clone produced a few hundreds units ml. The highest producer cell clone CHO γ12 was selected for amplification. Different cultures of CHO γ12 cells were exposed to either 20 or 50 nmoles Methotrexate Mx , which causes the death of most cells but allows us to select for resistant clones of cells in which the DNA segment containing the DHFR cDNA has been amplified and is now present in multiple copies. The co transfected human DNA segment containing the IFN γ gene is in most cases co amplified by this procedure, as can be demonstrated by Southern blots of the cellular DNA. A dozen Mx resistant clones were tested as above for secretion of human IFN γ . Two clones CHO γ146 The production of human IFN γ in the present CHO γ 301 cell line is very high as compared to other cell culture systems. Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate and phytohaemagglutinin, Yip et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 78, 1601 1605, 1981 obtained up to 5,000 units ml 6x10⁶ cells in 24 hours and up to 20,000 units 6x10⁶ cells after 90 hours. The CHO γ 301 cells produce 500 times more human IFN γ and do not require stimulation, allowing the continuous harvest of the IFN. The production level in the present CHO γ 301 cells is also 20 times higher than that obtained in CHO cells transfected by human IFN γ complementary cDNA Scahill et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80, 4654 4658, 1983 Haynes and Weissmann, Nucleic Acids Res. 11, 687 706, 1983 . We attribute this difference to the fact that the introns present in our construction, facilitate the expression of the transfected and amplified human gene. This was demonstrated by the analysis of total cellular RNA from CHO γ 301 cells for the presence of IFN γ mRNA by hybridization to IFN γ DNA, Fig. 4 . These cells contain a very high level of IFN γ specific mRNA which is at least 50 times higher than what is found in the non amplified CHO γ12 cells. Expression of genes can be greatly increased by the presence of transcriptional enhancer DNA sequences Gruss, DNA 3, 1 5, 1984 . The SV40 early gene promoter contains a 72 bp repeat which serves as an enhancer, but expression from this promoter can be further increased by adding retrovirus LTR regions which contain a strong enhancer Kriegler and Botchan, Mol. Cell. Biol. 3, 325 339, 1983 . We have constructed an improved pSVDHFR plasmid DNA to be used for co transfection with the human IFN γ gene pSVEY121, which yields in one step without amplification very high levels of IFN γ. The improved pSVDHFR vector pDHFR Ha was constructed by inserting a Hinc₂ BamH1 fragment of the Harvey murine sarcoma virus downstream to the fused SV40 promoter DHFR cDNA, and in the opposite orientation Fig. 5 . Co transfection of CHO DHFR cells with pSVEγ121 and pDHFR Ha DNA gave us 3 clones DHFR , one of which γ21, expressed IFN γ constitutively at levels of 150,000 units ml day, i.e. 10 times more than the other unamplified transformant cells. Analysis of the RNA from CHO γ21 cells showed a very strong band of IFN γ mRNA Fig. 4 , confirming the stimulatory influence of the Harvey virus enhancer on expression of the neighboring genes. These very high levels were obtained in one step after transfection, that is without amplification. When we applied Mx to CHO γ_21 cells, a further amplification could be obtained and yields of 400,000 units ml day were achieved. To obtain maximal yields of human IFN γ, the CHO γ 301 cells are preferably grown to high density on suitable glass, plastic or other polymeric surfaces microcarrlers and maintained in the cultures with daily changes of the medium. The culture medium DMEM with 150 µg ml proline should contain a minimum of foreign proteins. We have found that 1 percent FCS in the medium is sufficient to give optimal yields of IFN. Stationary cultures in large tissue culture plastic trays, give the best yields of IFN γ. Each tray with 50 100 ml of medium yields 100 million units of IFN γ every 24 hours. An industrial production unit of 50 trays 500cm² each gives 50 mg IFN γ daily. Each tray with 50 100 ml of medium yields 100 million units of IFN γ every 24 hours. An industrial production unit of trays 500cm² each gives 50 mg IFN γ daily. This represents a very important advance over existing methods for producing this precious and sparse material. In addition, and most important, the material produced is identical to the natural IFN γ produced by human blood cells, which is not the case for the product made from E.coli which is ungl ycosylated and differs at its N terminal end from the natural IFN γ. Evidence for the identity of CHO IFN γ produced by the present methodology with the natural human glycoprotein was obtained by purification on columns of monoclonal antibodies. Five liters of medium from CHO γ301 cultures were concentrated by ultrafiltration on a Pellicon membrane Millipore Co. with a cutoff of 10,000 Mr. The concentrated solution 245 ml was centrifuged at 10,000xg for 10 minutes at 4⁰C and applied with a flow rate of 0.5ml min to a column of monoclonal antibody number 3 3 bound to polyacryl hydrazide agarose 10 ml agarose, 9mg ml IgG . The column at 4 C was washed with phosphate buffered saline 400ml , followed by 1M NaCl at pH 7 400ml . IFN γ was then eluted from the column with 3M NaCl, 0.15M NH₄OH PH 10.5 11.0 and 6 fractions of 10 ml each were collected and immediately neutralized with 0.4 ml of acetic acetic acid 1N for each fraction. The purification was over 3,000 fold with no loss of activity. The specific activity of the purified IFN γ reached 1.6x10⁸ units mg protein Table 2 . Analysis of the eluted proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel 15 percent Fig 6 electrophoresis revealed a major protein band at 26,000 Mw, which co migrates with the main component of natural IFN γ extracted from blood cells. An additional 21,000 Mw band represents a partially glycosylated form of IFN γ Novick et al, EMBO J. 2, 1527 1530, 1983 Yip et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 79, 1820 1824, 1982 . A very small amount of a 17,000 Mw protein is also present and corresponds to the size of non glycosylated IFN γ as shown by comparison to the non glycosylated bacterially produced human IFN γ Gray et al, Nature 295, 503 508, 1982 . The procedure herein described is therefore applicable to the industrial production of pure human IFN γ at low costs and with a minumum of manipulations. Large batches of IFN γ can be purified in one step yielding 50 million units per ml of column. Large columns of 1 300 ml can be easily prepared for industrial use. The same column can be used for repeated uses for prolonged periods of time. The novel process for the production of human IFN γ in pure form is based on several inventive steps which represent significant progress over previously described methods, using either blood cells, or bacteria, or hamster cells subjected to genetic engineering. The most significant progress is in the amounts of IFN γ obtained by the cell line designated CHO γ301. Yields are 20 times higher than those obtained by other authors Scahill et al, Haynes and Weissmann, loci cited in hamster cells. This difference stems in part from our use of a large genomic DNA segment containing the natural introns of the IFN γ gene instead of the cDNA segment, which is only a copy of the mRNA. The difference also stems from optimization of the amplification and cell growth conditions. Yields are similar to what could be obtained in bacteria, but with the significant advantage that the product of hamster cells is glycosylated identically to the human product. Finally, yields are 100 500 times higher than with human blood cells and the need for induction is eliminated. The purification procedure on monoclonal antibodies using ammonia for elution represents a significant inventive step since IFN γ is destroyed by acid elution, which was used for affinity chromatography until now. The procedure has allowed us to determine the N terminal sequence of mature IFN γ. Also novel invention is the use of the Harvey sarcoma virus enhancer section V to enhance expression of IFN γ. The preferred cell line, CHO γ301, was deposited on June 13, 1984, with the Institut Pasteur, an International Depository Authority under the Budapest Treaty, as I 310. While we have described the use of a particular DHFR cDNA gene, other genes capable of conferring methotrexate resistance on the host cell may be employed. In addition to the natural Harvey Marine Sarcoma virus enhancer, we envision that modified sequences which retain enhancer activity may find utility in the practice of this invention.
