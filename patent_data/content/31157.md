## Description
The present invention concerns manufactured articles with improved physical mechanical and optical properties, such as plates, tubes, sandwich structures and formed bodies in gener al, as well as to the process for their preparation. It is quite known that film forming polymers, susceptible of being oriented, such as for instance isotactic polypropyle ne, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyamides, may be formed, in general, by thermoforming operations such as pressing, calend ering, extrusion, pressure injection molding, vacuum forming and the likes. The manufactured articles obtained with the above mention ed procçsses display mechanical and physical properties that differ from those of the manufactured articles obtained from the same polymers and having a highly oriented structure, more particularly, in general they are little transparent with consequently a limitation of the applicative fields. So far there have been obtained, with industrial processes, articles with a highly oriented structure only in the form of fibres and films. Thus object of this invention is that of providing manufactured articles consisting of plates, tubes and formed bodies in general, having a minimum thickness of at least 0.3 mm and a highly oriented structure, characterized in that they show mechanical and physical properties that are much higher than those obtainable in analogous articles obtained by conventional processes. These manufactured articles are obtained by pressing under heat thermopressing a combination of superimposed orien ed films. The manufactured articles obtained according to this invention, in general appear as a compact material, displaying a high degree of physical homogeneity. The preparation process includes the following phases 1 Several mono or bi stretched films are superimposed on each other, either by unwinding numerous film reels or by winding up the film in many layers on a cylinder and then by cutting the film along the generating line of the cylinder, or by other methods 2 The structure formed by the assembly of superimposed films is subjected to a thermopressing operation, on presses, calenders and the like, at pressures comprised between 1 and 500 Kg cm2, at temperatures lower than, but near, the crystalline melting temperature in the case of prevalingly crystalline polymers, while in the case of prevailingly amorphous polymers, at temperatures near the glass transition temperature and not greater than the softening temperature. The pressing time varies from one second to several hours and is inversely proportional to the pressure. Preferably there are used pressures of at least 10Kg cm2. The thermopressing may be achieved without applying a pressure from the outside in the case of manufactured articles with a curved surface and such as to allow to exploit the pressure resulting from the thermoshrinkage stresses developed by the single films, in order to obtain the compres sion and forming effect. The superimposition of the single films may be carried out in such a way that the directions of orientation of the single films shall cross each other. As film forming polymers susceptible to of being oriented and suited for use in this invention, proved to be the polymers capable of supplying oriented film such as the poly esters, the polyamides, the vinylidene and vinyl polymers and copolymers and the like. The films, before their superimposition, may be subjected to a surface treatment with continuous, non perforating electrical discharges, or by means of chemical agents or by flame. The films, whose thickness may vary within very wide ran ges, are superimposed and then thermopressed in different numbers, depending on the thickness that one desires to obtain on the manufactures article. In the preparation of the manufactured articles according to this invention, there may also be used films made of two or more different polymers, chosen from amongst the above mentioned ones, by suitably combining them with each other. The preparation of the mono or bi oriented films to be used in the manufacture of manufactured articles according to this invention, is carried out with the help of conventional methods and equipment. In the case one wishes to obtain products with a high transparency, it will be necessary to use films with haze values, in general, lower than 5 measured according to ASTM D 1003 . Thereby there are obtained manufactured articles of high transparency, while in the manufactured articles of the same thickness, but obtained by forming powders, granules or flakes of film forming polymers, according to conventional methods in presses, calenders, in thermoforming equipment and the like, no transparency will be achieved. Moreover, the manufactured articles according to this invention, in comparison with the conventionally manufactured articles, show much higher values as to tensile strength, flexural strength, impact strength and perforation strength, which remain excellent even at low temperatures. Moreover, the linear thermal expansion coefficient is significantly much lower. More particularly, the manufactured articles obtained starting from bi stretched films, show a breaking load greater than 10 Kg cm2 measured according to ASTM D 638 , aRockwell hardness of at least B5 according to ASTM D 785 of the HRL scale , a perforation strength greater than 1,000Kg cm of thickness according to the method described in Ma terie Plastiche Elastomeri 37 1971 pages 670 673 .In many cases they do not show any brittle fracture at 50 OC.1 Some of them show a high transparency. 1 The oriented structure manufactured articles, prepared according to this invention, find their direct use in the form of plates, tubes and the like, as well as in the preparation of other manufactured articles such as, for instan ce, sandwich structures. Thanks to their high mechanical properties the manufactured articles according to this invention give excellent performances in the form of protective screens. In the practical embodiments of this invention there may be introduced wide modifications and changes, without thereby falling outside the concept and the protective scope of the invention itself.
