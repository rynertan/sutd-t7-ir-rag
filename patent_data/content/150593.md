# Polarized ribbon cable connector having circuit components therein.

## Abstract
A polarized ribbon cable connector which facilitates the placement of electrical or circuit components therein is taught. Briefly stated, a housing lower assembly 126 is profiled 146 to receive a carrier strip 124 therein. The carrier strip has bent up portions 130, 132 which provide for insulation dis placement connection with electrical wires. An intermediate assembly 112 is disposed on top of the carrier strip with a channel 114 therein to receive a ribbon cable 104 . A hous ing top assembly 90 is disposed on top of the ribbon cable and has latches 92 which mate with tabs 128 contained on the lower assembly thereby interlocking the components to gether. The carrier strip also has contact legs 143 disposed therein which allow for electrical contact to be made with pads 102 contained in an insertable logic package 100 . Knockout pin apertures 144 disposed in the lower assembly allow por tions of the carrier strip to be electrically isolated from the con tact legs. Additionally, response command pin apertures 140 are also disposed in the lower assembly which thereby allow respond command plugs 150 having pins 160 therein to mate with the lower assembly whereby the pins contained in the plugs contact different portions of the carrier strip.
