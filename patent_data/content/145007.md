# PLAYBACK SYSTEM GRINDING ROBOT

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a structure and a control of the playback system grinding robot having a dual degree of freedom of the polar coordinate which is characterized by such a contrivance that No. 2 arm is attached in a freely turnable condition to a head of freely turnable No. 1 arm and an arm for driving said No. 2 arm is arranged adjacent to the said No. 1 arm and an abrasive tool is arranged to be freely turnable to different direction and to be pressed perpendicularly downward by a hydraulic cylin der attached to a head of said No. 2 arm and to be closely contacted always to a curved surface of the die notwithstand ing that the aforesaid arm driving system takes a plane movement. Further, the grinding robot according to the present invention is so designed that a direction sensor is arranged at a head of No. 2 arm and said sensor acts to store directional data together with positional data in a memory device at the time of teaching , especially to input turnback point data on the tool traveling locus exactly into the memory device in accordance with a change of the direction al data and also acts on the control device to cause the abrasive tool motion to forcedly decelerate when the direc tional data changes at the time of playback work and to decide a proper speed of the playback work by using the directional data jointly with a variation volume of the positional data. Furthermore, the grinding robot according to the present invention is provided with a random correction flag device which makes it possible to indicate a corrective direction of the abrasive tool travelling route at the time of playback work in order of plus correction , zero 0 , minus correction , zero 0 , instead of the fiducial locus of the abrasive tool taught at the time of teaching and to correct the moving volume in such a way as 0 Î± 0 for the inputted positional data and to travel the abrasive tool zigzag and randomly on its route, thereby ensuring a manufacture of the finished products entriely free from facial difference.
