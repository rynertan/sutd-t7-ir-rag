## Description
Hybrid Car with Electric and Heat Engine The present application is a continuation in part of an earlier filed co pending application entitled HybridCar with Electric and Heat Engine, Serial Number 885,797 filed March 13, 1978, now abandoned. The present invention relates to the field of hybrid vehicles having both a heat engine and one or more electric motors for driving the vehicle. More particularly, an apparatus is taught adopted for economical and low exhaust emission travel by operator selection of either heat engine or electric drive.The operator may also select the constant power charge rate necessary to fully recharge the batteries in the estimated time that heat engine drive will be utilized. Many attempts have been made in the prior art to devise hybrid vehicles utilizing both heat engines and electric motors, however, none of the known attempts allow operator selection of either battery powered electric motor drive or heat engine drive with recharging of the batteries atnan operator selected constant power rate over a range of vehicle speed. Such an arrangement allows the charging power rate to be varied to give greater flexibility in recharging of the storage batteries during the estimated time the vehicle is to be driven in the heat engine mode. Further, none of the known prior art teaches a means for controlling vehicle speed in both modes utilizing a single accelerator pedal which is connected alternately to the heat engine fuel metering device or the means for controlling the power fed to the electric motor but not both simultaneously.Since the means for controlling power fed to the electric motor is also used to control the charging power rate, the single accelerator pedal arrangement allows independent control by the battery charging system of the means for controlling power while the single accelerator pedal is controlling the fuel metering device of the heat engine.Such an arrangement also allows the heat engine to idle while driving in the electric drive mode for rapid transition from electric drive to heat engine drive. Further, none of the known prior art discloses the overcharge control system or the overdrive system disclosed herein. Finally, the high speed lockout and the details of the regnerative braking system also appear to be new as is the differential turn system and the changeover system. For example, in Yardney, U.S. Serial No. 3,503,464 a vehicle is driven by an electric motor fed by power from a generator was disclosed. The generator was powered by a heat engine at high speeds. At low speeds, the Yarndey car was driven by the same electric motor fed from batteries. Automatic changeover from battery power to generator power at a speed selected by the operator was taught.Speed in both modes was controlled by a single accelerator pedal which was always simultaneously connected to both the pule width modulator controlling the electric motor speed and the fuel metering device for the heat engine. The voltage output from the generator varied in proportion to the heat engine speed sucu that depression of the accelerator simultaneously increased the speed of the heat engine and the rate of power fed through the pulse width mqdulator to the electric motor.There was a stor battery in theYardney car, but the charging power rate varied in proportion to the power output of the generator and no constant power rate could be selected by the opie ator. Further, there was no teaching of automatic cutoff of charging when the batteries were fully charged. Nor was charging power derived from the electric motors operating as generators driven by one set of wheels while the heat engine was driving another set of wheels. The vehicle disclosed in Horwinski, U.S. SerialNo. 4,042,056 did utilize an electric motor driving one set of wheels with a heat engine driving another set.However, there the resemblance ends. The vehicle is designed to be driven primarily by the electric motor with the heat engine automatically starting when the vehicle reaches a predetermined speed in those circumstances where the battery is less than half charged. The battery charging system of the Horwinski car is also different from the present invention. Horwinski recharges from electric power derived either from a battery charger plugged into an external source such as line current or from a separate electric generator driven by the heat engine. No system for charging at a constant rate of power is disclosed, nor is operator selection of the rate of charge disclosed. No single accelerator system is disclosed which independently controls either the heat engine speed or the electric motor speed as selected by the operator. Nothing is disclosed in Horwinski regarding the structure used to accomplish the connections of the foot throttle to the heat engine and the electric motor control circuit to clarify whether the foot throttle is always simultaneously connected to both or selectively coupled to either. Further, speed control in electric drive is primarily accomplished by use of a hydraulically actuated, continuously variable ratio transmission, the ratio of the transmission being controlled by the foot throttle and associated relay circuitry. In Pieper, U.S. Serial No. 2,244,216, a vehicle was taught with a heat engine which could be connected to either front or rear wheels. An electric motor in the same power train was connected to the heat engine by a manual clutch or to the rear wheels by an electric clutch.The electric motor was driven either by battery power or by power from a generator driven by the heat engine. The batteries were recharged from energy derived from the electric motor when driven by the axle. There was no teaching of a single accelerator that controlled either the heat engine mechanically and the electric motor electronically but not both simultaneously. Also, the rate of charging power was neither operator selected nor constant, and there was no teaching of an automatic cutoff of charging when the batteries were fully charged. Electric clutches were utilized to connect the electric motor to the driven wheels after a back EMF in the electric motor rises to a sufficient value to cut down starting current. In Mori, U.S. Serial No. 3,623,568, a heat engine, electric generator, and electric motor were all placed in the same power train to the wheels. The generator charged a storage battery and drove the electric motor. ttori maintained a constant current charge rate through a tachometer and control circuit which measured the relative rotation of planetary gears connected to the armature and field of the generator and varied the field current accordingly. However, the rate of charge could not be selected by the operator. There was no teaching of separate drive of one set of wheels by one power source and another set of wheels by the other power source, and there was no teaching of a single accelerator device that could selectively control either the heat engine medhanicaily or the electric motor electronically but not both simultaneously. Motor speed was controlled by regulating motor field current and not armature current as in the present invention. The vehicle taught in Grady, U.S. Serial No.3,454,122 discloses a regenerative braking system which utilizes a servo amplifier to control the field current in the electric motors. The regenerative braking transducer applies an error signal to the input of the servo amplifier which in turn increases the field flux in the electric motors. This increased flux causes an increased output voltage from the armature winding which exceeds the battery voltage. when this occurs, the direction of current flow in the motor armatures reverses and charging of the batteries occurs which result in increased mechanical load on the wheels driving the electric motors. The reversal of armature current cancels the error signal at the servo amplifier input. Regenerative braking in the present invention is done differently. Regenerative braking occurs only when the accelerator pedal is undepressed in either heat engine drive or electric drive. In this condition, the control input of a 2 chopper or pulse width modulator is connected to a transducer mechanically linked to the brake pedal. A control voltage which varies in proportion to braking pressure is applied to the control input. The chopper is connected to control power flowing between the battery and the electric motor in proportion to the signal at its control input. Increas ed braking pressure causes the chopper to change the pulse width or frequency or both of power passing through it from the electric motors to increase the average power flowing into the battery.The increased power translates into increased mechanical load on the rear wheels driving the electric motors. There is also an inductor connected between the electric motor and the pulse width modulator of the preset invention which steps up the output voltage from the armature. This step up causes the output voltage from the armatures to exceed the battery voltage even at vehicle speeds below ten miles per hour. Accordingly, battery caring and regenerative braking can occur at very low vehicle speeds, an advantage not found in Grady as noted mere at column 3, lines 58 60. Grady also discloses a system to extend the range of speed control of the electric motors by switching the armatures of the motors from series to parallel connection acrcss the battery as the vehicle exceeds a. predetermined road speed. The present invention increases the vehicle speed in an overdrive system utilizing a field weakening effect.Each electric motor may have at least two separately excitable field windings. All these field windings are energized when high torque is needed. However, when vehicle speed reaches a predetermined value, the current in one or more of the field windings in each motor is reduced. The reduction is accomplished in one embodiment by a relay connected to the output of a D.C.. tachometer through a zener diode. Thetrelay pulls in when the breakdown voltage of the zener is exceeded. The advantage of this arrangement lies in elimination of the necessity of switching high armature currents and the concomitant arcing and deterioration of switch contacts. Grady apparently discloses no means for prevention of such arcing. Other U.S. Patents of some relevance are Papst,U.S. Serial No. 3,211,249 Nims, U.S. Serial No. 2,666,492 Matsukata, U.S. Serial No. 3,502,165 Froelich, U.S. SerialNo. 1,814,014 Reinbeck, U.S. Serial No. 3,888,325 Kinashita, U.S. Serial No. 3,970, 63. Thus it is that the prior art fails to fill the need for a dependable, low emission hybrid car capable of electrically powered, silent and non polluting travel in the cities and high speed, long range travel powered by a small, low emission heat engine. Convenience and depend abir have long been the nemesis of electric car builders. The low speed and short range of prior art electric cars has led to minimal consumer acceptance of them as a viable alternative to the noisy, gas guzzling standard auto. The inconvenience of being caught away from home with batteries down, and the long recharging times of prior cars have led to less than wholehearted acceptance by the public. Attempts to devise an electric car capable of travel at highway speed have resulted in excessive battery weight. When heat engines were used to drive generators which in turn drove electric motors, noise, pollution, and inefficiency problems emerged. Some prior art vehicles, such as Horwinski, used both a heat engine and an electric motor but provided for automatic changeover to or from the heat engine when predetermined criteria were met. Such an arrangement precludes operator selection of the desired power plant. Some day some communities may completely outlaw internal combustion engines to lower noise and pollution in which case operator selection would be desirable. Finally, quite often these prior vehicles utilized complicated and expensive transmissions linking the heat engine and electric motor to the same set of driven wheels. The vehicle of the present invention is both lightweight and capable of high speed sustained travel.It is quiet and clean and can be recharged away from home merely by driving for a short time with the heat engine at an operator selected high rate of charge. Thus the possibility of being marooned with dead batteries is eliminated.Because the rate of charge may be selected by the operator, recharging times can be relatively short. Complete flexibility in choice of power plant and charge rate is inherent in the design of the present invention. Finally, total gas mileage and pollution are improved by substantial use of electric drive, and complicated and expensive transmissions are eliminated by a separate pair of drive wheels for each power plant. The hybrid vehicle disclosed herein features operator selection of either mode of drive. Either heat engine drive of the front wheels or electric drive of the rear wheels can be selected but not both simultaneously.This system combines the speed and power advantages of an internal combustion engine with the economy and nonpolluting nature of storage batteries and electric motor drive. When high speed, long range operation is necessary, or where the batteries are run down, or where front wheel drive is necessary, the heat engine mode can be selected. The main batteries are recharged by the electric motors acting as generators when the vehicle is in heat engine drive. When it is necessary to reduce air pollution1 or where stop and go traffic is encountered, or where rear wheel drive is needed, electric drive can be selected. The electric drive mode is also available when fuel reserves for the heat engine are Renleted Recharging of the main batteries is accomplished by a battery charging system featuring a substantially constant rate of power input over a range of vehicle speeds where the charging rate is selected by the operator. Charging at the selected rate over a wide range of vehicle speeds is made possible by an inductor which stews up the output voltage of the motor armatures to a voltage above that of the main battery even at low vehicle speeds. A power controller regulates the average power fed from the electric motors to the main batteries by opping11 the power output of the motor armatures in cncsrd with a control signal. The control signal is der from humming network which sums voltages represent the charging rate desired by the operator and the speed cf the vehicle.The r zu t t taí r coz rol signal changes the pulse width or frequency or both of the armature output as the power output of the motors increases with increasing vehicle speed.The resultant, average power input to the batteries remains substantially constant. A power plant speed control system controls the speed of either the heat engine or the electric motors and controls switching of the power controller between its charging configuration and its electric drive configuration. A single accelerator pedal is alternately controls to either the heat engine or a speed control transducer controlling to the power controller. Which power plant said single accelerator controls is selected by the operator with a dashboard mounted mode switch which in turn controls an electromechanical device. This electromechanical device physically changes the mechanical orientation of the accelerator pedal from controlling the heat engine fuel metering device to controlling the speed control transducer. A switch operated by the accelerator pedal controls a group of contactors which switch the power controller to its charging configuration.The charging configuration exists whenever the accelerator pedal is undepressed or the vehicle is in heat engine drive. Mechanical braking is assisted by a regenerative braking system. When the accelerator pedal is undepressed or the vehicle is in heat engine drive and the brake pedal is depressed, the connections of the power controller will be changed to the charging configuration. Further, the control input will be connected to a transducer operated by the brake pedal. Increasing pressure on the brake pedal will increase the power fed from the power controller to the main battery. The energy absorbed by the battery domes from the kinetic energy of the vehicle converted to electricity by the wheel driven electric motors. Therefore, increased absorbed electrical energy is reflected in increased absorbed kinetic energy. The main battery must be protected from cver charging. An overcharge control system stands ready to reduce the charging when the voltage of the main battery rises to a predetermined level. transistor is connected as a switch to the output of the humming network of the battery charging system to ground the control signal at the control input of the power controller when the transitor is driven into saturation. S lhen the main battery voltage rises to the predetermined level a sufficient voltage is applied to the base of. the transistor to drive it into saturation effectively grounding the control input or the power controller. The maximum speed of electric motors is limited by the increasing counter E.M.F. generated in the rotor t increasing rotational speed. Since the back E.M.F. is directly proportional to the strength of tne magnetic field generated by the field windings, the maximum spead of the motors can be increased by reducting the currend through the field windings. The overdrive system of the present invention perfo r tunis funct on. A D C. tacho meter mechanically connected to the armature of on of trne electric motors produces a D.C. voltage proportional to armature speed.Each motor can have at least two setar ately excitable field windings a start field anda charge run field. The overdrive system controls current in the start field. Two zener diodes of differing brea down voltages control two relays one of which causes insertion of a resistor in series with the start field reducing the current therein. The other rela causes a complete cut off current through the start field The operator may inadvertently hswitch from heat engine drive to electric drive while the vehicle is travelling above the speed at which thio position may be safely made.If there were no high speed loc out system, when the operator switched the direction selection switch tó either forward or reverse at high speeds the electrically operated clutches would attempt to connect the armatures of the electric motors to the rear wheels. The inertia of the armatures would damage the clutches. To prevent this, the speedometer speed indicator is fitted with a mask which blocks light from a light source from reaching a photoresistor below a predetermined speed. The photoresistor controls a relay which interlocks with the clutch circuit preventing engagement of the clutches when the vehicle is travelling faster than the predetermined speed. When lead acid storage batteries are charging they generate hydrogen which, if not removed, can accumulate in closed spaces and cause an explosion. To prevent this, a battery venting system is incorporated. A manifold collects the gases from each battery and vents them outside the car. The manifold is assisted on one end by a ram air scoop and on the other, by a venturi shaped scoop. When the vehicle turns, the different turning radii of the rear wheels causes the electric motors to turn at different speeds. Since both motors are being fed the same average power, undesirable loading effects are caused in the motor that is forced to turn slower than its armature current would have it turn. To reduce the stress on the motor armature caused by this effect, a differential turn system is employed which senses when the vehicle is turning and inserts a resistance in the circuit of the vehicle speed control system which lowers the voltage at the control input of the power controller. This cuts the average power fed to both motors during the turn and eliminates the undesirable stresses. In changing from electric drive to heat engine drive while travelling the operator would be required to move the ignition key switch from electric to ignition , move the mode switch from electric to gas , push in the mechanical clutch, put the transaxle in either third or fourth gear, and release the clutch. The changeover system reduces the number of steps in the operation. This system, in one embodiment, utilizes an electromechanical servo and interlocks with the tachometer and the gear shift lever.The servo disengages the mechanical clutch when the ignition key switch is turned to ignition r the vehicle is in neutral and travelling above a certain speed. when the gear shift lever is moved to the third cr fourth gear position, the servo circuit is broken and the clutch pedal is released engaging the clutch and starting the heat engine.

Referring now to Figs. 1 and 1A, a chassis 274 supports electric motors 1 which are coupled through electrically operated clutches 2 to helical pinions 3 which engage gears 4 to drive rear axle 7 and rear wheels 5. The electric motors I are secured to chassis 274 by moufltings 6. A battery frame 10 connected to chassis 274 holds main battery 12 comprised of several smaller batteries. Main battery 12 is vented by battery venting system 11. A power controller 13 is located under the vehicle in the airstream to control electric motors 1 and the charging rate of main battery 12. Power controller 13 is a chopper for controlling average power by varying both pulse width and frequency or pulse width alone. Inductor 23 is also placed in the airstream under the vehicle for cooling purposes.Inductor 23 and power controller 13 have several functions in the battery charging system, the regenerative braking system, and the propulsion system.which will be explained subsequently. A tachometer 9 is coupled to the armature shaft of one of the motors and is a part of several of the control systems of the vehicle.Heat engine 14 is mounted on chassis 274 and is coupled to front wheels 5A through transaxle 15 and mechanical clutch 16. Shift lever 17 controls transaxle 15. Brake pedal 25 controls both s standard hydraulic or mechanical braking system connected to brake drums 8 and the regenerative braking system. Accelerator pedal 18 in conjunction with vehicle speed control system 20 controls the speed of either heat engine 14 or electric motors 1 depending upon the position of mode switch 19. In an alternative embodiment mode switch 19 may be placed on the top of shift lever 17.Ignition ey switch 21 controls auxiliary battery 12A not shown and applies power therefrom to the vehicle control system ils the E position, or to the heat engine ignition in th I position, or to the starter for the heat engine in the ST position. Speedometer 28 is equipped with a mask 29. Speedometer speed indicator 29A and mask 29 move to as to prevent light from light source 26 from reaching pho .oresistor 27 at low speed. Finally, charge rate select 24 allows operator selection of the charged rate of mai battery 12. Referring now to Figs. 2, 6 a,d 6C the structure and operation of the vehicle control systems will be discussed. The vehicle can be powered either by heat engine 14 driving front wheels 5A through mechanical clutch 16 and transale 15 or by electric motors 1 driving rear wheels 5 through electrically operated clutches 2 The speed of heat engine 14 is controlled by a conventional fuel metering device such as a carburettor. The speed of electric motors 1 is controlled by power controller 13 which functions to control the average power entering or leaving said electric motor 1 in accordance with a control signal applied to control input 37.Any conventional electronic controller or 11chopper may b used, but an EVC 400 36 pulse width modulator is used in the preferred embodiment. The power. controller 13 has a positive power terminal 35, a negative power terminal 36 and a chopped power terminal 34. The positive power terminal 35 is connected to the positive terminal 38 of main battery 12 by line 40, and the negative power terminal is connected to the negative terminal 39 of main battery 12 by line 41.Chopped power terminal 34 is connected to contactor 42 by lines 107 and 43, negative power terminal 36 is connected to contactor 71 by line 41, and positive power terminal 35 is connected to contactor 72 by line 73. Contactors 71, 74, 72 and 42 are connected to contactors 75, 76 77 and 78 and to inductor 23 and electric motors by a network of lines for purposes of rearranging the power controllermotor inductor circuit. The exact manner in which the rearrangement is done will be explained subsequently, but, for now, suffice it to say that the purpose of the rearrangement is to reverse the direction of current in the armatures of electric motors 1 in electric drive and to convert from the electric drive mode to the battery charging mode. Power controller 13 is connected to inductor 23 through the previously mentioned contactors by line 79. Inductor 23 is connected to the brushes on one side of the armature windings of electric motors 1 by line 80. The opposite side brushes are connected to contactor 78 by line 81. The function of power controller 13 is to con trol the average power entering or leaving armature windings IA of electric motors 1. The average power is varied by chopping the battery voltage at positive and negative power terminals 35 and 36 into pulses of varying width or frequency or both at chopped power terminal 34 in proportion to the control signal at control input 37. Inductor 23 has two purposes. One of these is to step up the output voltage from armature windings 1A for battery charging as will be explained subsequently. The other purpose is to increase the apparent inductance of armature windings 1A as seen by power controller 13. Controller 13 will not operate properly when its power terminals 34, 35 and 36 are connected to a low inductance load. Control of the direction of the vehicle in heat engine drive is accomplished by transaxle 15 and shift lever 17. In electric drive, however, control of vehicle direction is done by reversing the direction of the cur rent flow in motor armatures IA. Referring now to Figs. 7 and 2 in addition to Fig. 6c, forward reverse selection contactors 80, charge run election contractors 33, and direction selection switch 22 combine to cause this reversal. Direction selection switch 22 has four posi tions starting from the extreme countercloc wise position they are OFF, O D, Ft 7D, and REV. The three wipers 81, 82 and 83 each serve to control various devices which will be explained subsequently, b ut only wipers 81 and 83 function in direction control. Referring now to Figs. 6A, B and C, electric drive direction selection starts at auxiliary battery 84 which is connected by line 85 to ignition key switch 21. when this switch is in the ELECTRIC position, line 86 energizes three of the four terminals r , FWD and REV associated with wiper 83. Since wipers 81 and 83 are electrically connected together, wiper 81 is energized whenever ignition key switch 21 is in ELECTRIC and direction selection switch 22 is in either r position or REV. then in REV, wiper 81 energizes line 87 which energizes the wiper of switch 88 in the power plant speed control system 20. The wiper of switch 88 is physically operated by accelerator pedal 18. when accelerator pedal 18 is depressed in the electric drive mode, switch 88 is closed and line 89 and the coil of rla 90 is energized.When relay 90 is energized wiper 91 closes with contact 92. Wiper 91 is connected to line 93 which line is energized by contact 94 and wiper 95 of relay 96 in high speed lockout circuit 97. The function of high speed lockout circuit 97 is to prevent initiating energization of all the devices connected to line 93 when the vehicle is travelling above a predetermined speed. The detailed operation of this circuit will be explained subsequently.Suffice it to say now that wiper 95 and contact 94 will be closed at low vehicle speeds. Wiper 95 is connected by line 98 to the j r and REV terminals associated with wiper 8Z of direction selection switch 22. Wiper 82 is energized by a positive 42 volts from main battery 12 by lines 99 and 40 through emergency switch 100. Emergency switch 100 disconnects main battery 12 from power controller 13 either manually or automatically when overload currents are sensed. If direction selection switch 22 is in either t position or in REV, then wiper 91 cf relay 90 will be energized along lines 98 and 93. ashen the coil of relay 90 is not energized because of the positions of accelera tor pedal 18 or wiper 81, wiper 91 applies 42 volts to the coils of contactors 75 and 77 through contact 101 and line 102. These contactors put the circuit including main battery 12, power controller 13, inductor 23, and armature windings 1A in the FORWARD configuration shown inFig. 8. Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the arrangement bf the electric motor drive circuit in the electric drive forward and electric drive reverse configuration respectively. In the electric drive reverse configuration, contactors 76 and 78 are energized by line 103 and c103 contactors 75 and 77 are open. This configuration corresponds to energization of relay 90 by line 89 causing wipers 91 and 104 to close with contacts 92 and 105 respectively. Forward reverse selection contactors 80 are ultimately controlled by the positions of accelerator pedal 18 and direction selection switch 22. When direction selector switch 22 is in either FWD position relay 90 is de energized and contactors 75 and 77 are energized and closed, and contactors 76 and 78 are open. In this configuration, the lines involved in the electric involved in the electric motor drive circuit are as numbered on Figures 8 and 6C. Wlien direction selector switch 22 is placed in theREV position, relay 90 will be energized providing switch 88 is closed. Switch 88 will be closed only when accelerator pedal 18 is depressed and electric drive has been selected by mode switch 19. When relay 90 is energized, it closes contactors 76 and 78 and contactors 75 and 77 will open. This puts the vehicle in the electric drive reverse configuration and the connections will be as shown in Figues 9 and 6. emote that in Figure 8 current is flowing into armature winding IA by line 81 whereas in Figure 9 current is flowing into the armature via line 80. In bo h Fig, 8 and Fig. 9 current is being chopped between chopped power terminal 34 and negative power terminal 36. Also in both Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 contactors 72 and 74 are closed while contactors 71 and 42 are open.This condition indicates the vehicle is in the electric drive mode as opposed to the battery charging configuration. The battery charging configuration, as shown inFig. 7, occurs in two circumstances only when the vehicle is in heat engine drive, and when the vehicle is in electric drive with accelerator pedal 18 undepressed. The latter condition represents the regenerative braking configuration. The charging configuration, as shown inFigure 7, requires the closure of contactors 71, 42, 75 and 77. Contactors 71 and 42 are controlled by relay lir. through contacts 111 and line 112. Energization c cor.. tactors 71 and 42 requires that relay 110 be energized Sf that contacts 111 are closed, and that rer 114 be deenergized so that contacts 115 are closed hen such the case, lines 93 and 98 from the contacts associatc o with wiper 82 of direction selection switch 22 will error gize contactors 71 and 42 along lines 113 and 112 providing direction selection switch 22 is in any position other than OFF . As seen by the above description, relays 114 and 110 control whether the charge run selection contactors 33 contactors 71, 74, 72 and 42 are in the CHARGE or RUN configuration. r nien relay 114 is energized, wiper 115 closes with contact 116 and line 93 then energizes and closes contactors 72 and 72 through line 117. This puts the vehicle in the electric drive or Rll configuration. The energization of the coil of relays 114 and 110 is controlled by lines 119, 123 and 121 121rizspectively Lines 123 and 119 are energized by the will af switch 120 operated by accelerator pedal 18. wiper 120 is energized by line 121 from wipers 81 and 83 of di. tion selection switch 22, and line 123 is energized when accelerator pedal 18 is depressed. Switch 122 opens when brake pedal 25 is depressed, and is a safety feature insuring that relay 114 cannot be energized by depression of accelerator pedal 18 when brake pedal 25 is depressed.Thus it is that when direction selector switch 22 is in either F 5D position or in REV the vehicle is placed in the charge configuration when accelerator pedal 18 is undepressed and the run configuration when depressed assuming brake pedal 25 is undepressed in both cases. Speed control of the vehicle in either electric drive or heat engine drive is accomplished by co operation of accelerator pedal 18 and the power plant speed control system 20. Referring now to Figs. 3, 4, 5 and 5A, power plant speed control system 20 operates as follows. Fig. 3 shows the power plant speed control system in the heat engine drive configuration. Cable 44 is always attached to heat engine fuel metering device 45 and controls it when the operator presses down on accelerator 18. By pivotal action around point 46 accelerator 18 moves upper arm 47 back against main arm extension 48.Main arm extension 48 pushes plunger 49 through aligning bushing 50, and cable 44 is attached ta plunger 49. Main arm extension 48 is attached to main arm 51 which slides back and forth through sliding and pivoting bushing 52.The remaining components of the single accelerator are not in action in this mode. In the electric drive mode shown in Figure 4, solenoid 53 is energized by a signal from mode switch 19 in Fig. 6A at a mode select input connected to line 124.Line 124 is energized when mode switch 19 is placed in theELECTRIC position by virtue of the connection of the wiper of node switch 19 to auxiliary battery 84 by lines 86 and 85 through ignition key switch 21. The activation of soleroid 53 pulls solenoid plunger 54 and solenoid arm 55 closr to solenoid 53. Solenoid arm 55 pivots at 56 allowing solenoid roller 57 to contact rack rap and push it down to engage guiding means 59. Whe accelerator pedal 18 is depressed by the operator, upper arm 47 moves back pushing main arm extension 48 and main arm 51 toward movable arm 63 through sliding and pivoting bushing 52.Rack roller 60 attached to rack 58 of main arm 51 pushes against switch arm 61 operating the switches of block 62.Switch block 62 is comprised of switches 88, 120 and 125 shown on Figure 6A. As main arm 51 moves further, rack roller 60 contacts movable arm 63. As the movable arm 63 moves around pivot 64, rack 126 rotates speed control gear 65 which operates speed control potentiometer 66. Referring now to Figs. 4 and 6A, speed control potentiometer 66 controls the speed of electric motors 1 by applying a varying control voltage to terminal 37 of power controller 13. Power controller 13 has a positive 12 volts impressed on terminal 128 along line 121 originating at wipers 81 and 83 of direction selection switch 22. Power controller 13 converts this positive 12 volts to a stabilized 5 volt supply at terminal 129 and this stabilized 5 volt supple is apply to one end of the element of speed control potentiometer 66 along line 130 through normally closed contacts 131 of differential turn switch 132.The wiper of speed control potentiometer 66 transmits a portion of the stabilized 5 volts alone line 76 to contact 132 of interlock switch 125. When acceler ator pedal 18 is depressed in the electric nr5t.tedrive config uration of Fig. 4, the wiper of interlock switch 125 closes with contact 132, and the wiper of speed control potentiometer 66 is connected by lines 76 2Dd 133 to control input 37 of power controller there enabling pedal 18 to influence the average power p e.. ing through power controller 13. Referring now to Figs. 5 and tz, an alternative embodiment of the power plant speed control system is shown. In this embodiment, a gradient tint mask 69 is attached to the end of rack 58. Fig. 5A shows a plan view of gradient tint mask 69 seen as from section lines 5A.Light source 67 illuminates photoelectric cell 68 which changes its resistance with varying intensities of light passing through gradient tint mask 69. The intensity of light passing through the mask varies with the relative position of rack 58 to light source 67. Photoelectric cell 68 is used to control the control voltage at control input 37 of power controller 13 in Fig. 6C. In order to recover electrical energy converted into the kinetic energy of motion for more efficient operation of the car, a regenerative braking system 136 is employed. A potentiometer 135 is mechanically octuated by brake pedal 25. One end of the element of potentiometer 135 is connected through a voltage dropping resistor 137 to the stabilized 5 volt supply at terminal 129 of power controller 13 by line 130. The wiper of potentiometer 135 is connected by line 138 to contact 139 of interlock switch 141 which switch is also operated by brake pedal 25. When brake pedal 25 is depressed, the wiper of interlock switch 141 closes with contact 139 transmitting the voltage on line 138 along line 134 to contact 140 of interlock switch 125.When accelerator pedal 18 is undepressed in the electric drive configuration of Fig. 4, or when power plant speed control system 20 is in the heat engine drive configuration of Fig. 3, the wiper of interlock switch 125 will be in contact with contact 140. In this condition, potentiometer 135 will be controlling power controller 13 along line 133 to control input 37. Recall that switch 120 is ganged to interlock switch 125 and controls charge run selection contactors 33, and switch 120 will have already placed these contactors in the charge configuration.Increasing pressure on brake pedal 25 will cause power controller 13 to change the average power in the pulse train a power passíng from armature windings 1 A to main battery 12. Greater everage pc JJcr input to main batteries 12 translates increased mechanical drag on rear wheels 5 driving armature wind ings IA. Much of the energy used in accelerating the vehicle is thus recovered and stored in the batteries, The battery charging system employed in the vehicle features a constant rate of power input to main battery 12 with the race of power input select c operator.Referring now to Figs. 6A, B, and C, the charg ing rate is selected by manipulation of charge rate selector 24 as rown in Fig. 1. Charge rate select consists of two potentiometers 142 and 143 wit n gange wipers to work in unison as the operator manipt es charge rate selector knob. The two potentiomet s ate connected as a summing network with the output there being connected to control input 37 of t4 power control by lines 144, interlock switch 141 line 134, interlock switch 125 and line 133. As can seen from Figure the output line 144 of cha e rate selector 24 only con trols power controller 13 when interlock switches 141 and 125 are closed. For this condition to exist, the brake pedal 25 must be undepressed and the accelerator must be undepressed or the power plant speed control system 20 must be in the heat engine drive configuration.Whenever brake pedal 25 is depressed potentiomete controls power controller 13 for regenerative br king the operation of interlock switch 141. Constant power charging at rate selected by the operator allows flexibility in obtaining a tull char on main battery 12. The operator can minimize drag on the heat engine by setting the lowest charge necessary to bring the voltage of main battery 12 up volts during the time heat engine drive is to be used Constant power charging requires some meanssome vary ene control signal to power controller 13 to compensate for increased power output from armature windings 1A as vehicle speed increases. Charge rate selector 24 and tachometer 9 combine to provide this compensation. Potentiometer 142 serves to set the rate of charging desired by the operator.One end of the element of potentiometer 142 is connected to the stabilized 5 volt power source at terminal 128 of power controller 13 by line 121. The other end of the element is returned to ground by line 145. The wiper of potentiometer 142 is connected through resistor 146 to collector 147 of overcharge control transistor 148. The function of resistor 146 and transistor 148 will be explained in conjunction with the discussion of the overcharge control system. Collector 148 is connected to summing junction 149 by line 150. Potentiometer 143 provides compensation for vehicle speed by providing a negative offset voltage to summing junction 149. This negative offset voltage is derived by the action of potentiometer 143 in dividing off a portion of the speed proportional signal from tachometer 9. Tachometer 9 generates a D.C. voltage proportional to the rotational speed of one of the armature windings 1A.The negative terminal of tachometer 9 is connected to line 151 which is connected to terminal 152, which is the end of the element of potentiometer 143 opposite from the corresponding energized eni of potentiometer 142. The other end of the element o potentiometer 143 is returned to ground by line 145. Li cwise the positive terminal of tachometer 9 is returned tc ground by line 153 through zener diode 154 which servos to prevent the application of the tachometer output tc potentiometer 143 at low vehicle speeds thereby lim ting the range of speeds through which constant power ci urging is employed. Therefore, as vehicle speed increases, terminal 152 becomes increasirgly negative with Lespect to ground. The wiper of potentiometer 143 picks off a portion of this negative voltage and applies it to summing Junction 149 through line 155. Variable resistor 156 adjusts the voltage at humming mode 149 to insure that the voltage there varies in proper inverse relation to the power output of said armature winding to maintain substantially constant power charging. It is seen from the foregoing that when the operator sets charge rate selector 24 for a particular charge rate, the voltage at summing junction 149 Will assume a certain positive voltage from zero to 5 voltsAs vehicle speed increases, potentiometer 143 will aptly an increasingly negative voltage to summing junction 149 through line 155 and variable resistor 162 and will drive the resulting voltage there toward zero. The voltage at summing junction 149 also appears at control input 37 of power controller 13 under the circumstances noted above.As the voltage at control input 37 becomes less positive indicating increasing vehicle speed, the pulse width of the chopped waveform through power terminals 34, 35, and 36 becomes narrower. Because the output voltage from armature windings 1A increases with increasing vehicle speed, the narrower pulse width results in the same rser age power reaching main battery 12. Inductor 23 in Fig. 6C plays an important role in both the battery charging and regenerative a rn systems. Battery charging cannot occur till the output voltage of armature windings 1A exceeds the battery voltage. At low rotatio al speeds, the output voltage of the armature windings can fall below the battery voltage.Inductor 23 steps uy the output voltage from armature windings 1A such thlt it is above the batt voltage over a wider range vehicle speeds. Thus, su t rntially constant power battery charging and regenerative braking can occur even at very low vehicle speeds. In the electric drive mode1 Inductor 23 serves to increase the inductance of armature windings 1A as seen by power controller 13. A pulse width modulator of the type used in this vehicle will not operate into an inductance as low as armature windings 1A. As the main battery 12 recharges, its voltage rises. To prevent overcharging and damage to the battery, an overcharge control system 156 senses the charging voltage and grounds the summing junction 149 when the charging voltage on main battery 12 rises above 51 volts,Line 157 of Figs. 6A, B and C is connected to main battery 12 through wiper 82 of direction selection switch 22 and line 99. When the voltage on line 157 rises above a first breakdown voltage of 51 volts, first zener diode 158 breaks down and sends a trigger signal to first schmitt trigger 159 at trigger input 275. Schmitt trigger 159 then applies a pulse to a first input 276 of flip flop 160 setting it in a first of its two stable states. The base 85 of transistor 148 serves as the overcharge input and is connected to one of the output of flip flop 160 that goes high when first input 276 receives a pulse.Thus when first zener diode 158 breaks down1 a signal is sent to the base of transistor 148 which is driven into saturation.Resistor 146 prevents excessive collector current from flowing in transistor 148. Transistor 148 controls the control signal at 37 in Fig, 6C by effectively grounding the wiper of potentiometer 142 of charge rate selector 24 thereby reducing the voltage at sunLrning junction 149 to zero. This zero voltage at summing junction 149, when applied to control input 37, reduces the charging rate. The same charging voltage which triggered first zener diode 51, alsokbreaks doln second zener diode 159 if the main battery voltage is over a second breakdown voltage of 4w volts. If second zener diode 159 is con ducting, second d schrlitt trigger 16t is triggered by a second trigger signal from zener diode 159 at second trigger input 277. In this condition, a high or logic 1 exists at first input 165 of NOR gate 166. Since the second input of NOR gate 166 is always grounded by line 109, or held in a logic O or low state , the output 167 will not go high till input 165 goes low .This occurs when the voltage on line 157 drops below 46 volts and second zener diode 159 drops out of conduction. The output of second scbmitt trigger 164 will then go low causing NOR gate 166 to reset flip flop 160 by sendIr a reset signal to ts reset input 168 setting said flip flop in its second stable state. When flip flop 160 is reset, output 163 goes low , and transistor 148 drops cut of saturation. Charging is then resumed until the voltage on line 157 again rises above 51 volts. Main battery 12 generates hydrogen while charging as all lead acid storage batteries do. If this hydro gen accumulates in any enclosed area it poses a danger of exploding. To prevent such accwmula ion, battery venting system 11 of Figs. la, 2 and 19 provides ventilation for each battery of main battery 12. Deferring now to Fiq, 19, airtight battery compartment 10 holds the batteri .0. comprising main battery 12 within the exterior walls 170 of the car. Collector tube 171 receives gases from hollow tubes 172 that are inserted into battery cells 173. Collector tube 171 is vented through the side of the r where venturi shaped scoop 174 helps suck out the gorses by creating an area of low pressure at 175. Scoop 176 creates a ram air effect to push air into the collector tube thereby pushing the gases through collector tube 171.Collector tube 171 is higher at end 177 to he s gases flow. Excess gases which are trapped in battery compartment 169 and not collected by the collector tube 171 and hollow tubes 172 are vented by fan 178 through exhaust outlet 179. As mentioned above, protection is needed for electrically operated clutches 2 in Fig. 1A to prevent their destruction by sudden engagement with rapidly moving rear wheels 8. The same protection would be needed in an alternative embodiment with a mechanical clutch. This protection is provided by high speed lockout system 97.Referring now to Figs. 1, 2 and 6A, B and C, the system is comprised of light source 26 and photoresistor 27 mounted on speedometer 28. Mask 29 is mounted on moving speed indicator 29A of speedometer 28. Mask 29 prevents light from light source 26 from shining on photoresistor 27 at low speeds. In this condition, the resistance of photoresistor 27 is high. When the resistance of photoresistor 27 is high, the coil of relay 96 is de energized. This is because even if direction selection switch 22 is in theOFF position, no sufficient current from wiper 83 and line 98 can pass through and photoresistor 27 to energize the coil of relay 96. In this de energized state, contact 95 and 94 are closed and contacts 182 and 183 are open.Thus when direction selection switch 22 is turned to any position other than OFF, electrically operated clutches 2 may be energized by the line 98 93 circuit. When vehicle speed increases, mask 29 unblocks photoresistor 27 thereby allowing illumination from lamp 26 to drive the resistance of photoresistor 27 low. If direction selection switch 22 is in the OFF position when this unmasking occurs, relay 96 is energized via line 98.Thereafter, no device connected to contact 94 via line 93 may be energized by turning direction selection switch 22 to any position other than OFF because contacts 94 and 95 are open and contacts 182 and 183 are closed. If direction selection switch 22 is turned to a position other than OFF, contacts 182 and 183 hold relay 96 in an energized state. Electric motors are limited in the maximum speed they can achieve by the back E.M.F. generated in the armature winding as it spins through the magnetic field created by the field windings. It is possibleio increase the maximum speed of the motor by reducing the intensity of the magnetic field at high speeds. The overdrive system 30 of the vehicle disclosed herein does just that. Referring now to figures 2, 6A, B and C, overdrive system 186 is comprised of zener diodes 187 and 188, tachometer 9, relays 189 and 190, and 191, field reducing resistors 192, contactor 193, and start field windings 32. As shown in Fig. 6C, electric motors 1 each have, in the preferred embodiment, two separately excitable shunt 70un field windings the charge run field winding 31 and start field winding 32. These tazo windings arqneeded to create a sufficiently intense stationary magnetic field to provide magnetic field to provide the high tcrques needed when accelerating the vehicle or when the vehicle is under heavy load. However, at higher speeds where torque requirements are not as high, the magnetic field produced by the start field is not needed and, in fact, is counterproductive. Two steps of reduction of the intensity of the start winding magnetic field are employed. The first step in reduction occurs when the D.C. speed voltage from tachometer 9 on output line 153 rises above a first breaks down voltage level of a first zener diode 188. First zener diode 188 has a lower breakdown voltage Whan second zener diode 187. When first zener diode 188 begins to conduct, the voltage on line 153 as a first trigger signal is imposed upon the coil of relay 190 along line 194 and energizes relay 190 pulling wiper 195 into er,gavement with contact 196.When relay 190 is energized. te coil of relay 191 is grounded through contacts 1 rv D Mid 196 along the lines 197 and 198 to line 131 which i. connected to the negative terminal of main battery 12. The coil of relay 191 is connected to auxiliary battery 84 through line 121, wiper 83 of direction switch 22, line 86, ignition key switch 21, and line 185. Consequently, when ignition key switch 21 is in the ELECTRIC position and direction selection switch 22 is in either the FWD or REV positions, relay 191 will be energized when the voltage from tachometer 9 rises to a first level representing a predetermined vehicle speed. The effect of energization of relay 191 as to switch field reducing resistors 192 into the start field windings circuit in series with the windings the current flowing therein by removing the bypass path around resistors 192. The switching is done by wiper 198 and contact 199. Normally, current is fed to the start field windings 32 through line 93 and contactor 193. Recall that line 93 comes from terminals of direction selection switch 22 associated with wiper 82 through contacts 94 and 95 of high speed lockout circuit 97. Assume for the moment that contactor 193 is always closed when the vehicle is in electric drive. When contactor 193 is closed the voltage on line 93 is transferred to line 201. Current is thereby forced to flow through start field windings 32 by way of contacts 198 and 199 and line 200. But when relay 191 is energized as detailed above, wiper 198 breaks contact with contact 199, and the current in line 201 is forced to travel through field reducing resistors 192 via lines 201 and 200 to and from these resistors. Contacts 198 and 199 merely bypass these resistors thereby decreasing the start field current and magnetic field intensity when they open. The second step in field weakening occurs when the speed voltage from tachometer 9 rises still further and exceeds a second breakdown voltage level of zener diode 187. then this occurs relay 189 is energized via line 206 breaking the connection between contacts 204 and 205. The coil of contactor 193 is then de energized. When contactor 193 is de energized no current at all flows through start field windings 32 since the connection beS ween lines 93 and 201 is broken. By this means the magnetic field generated by start field windings 32 is reduced to zero. Alternatively, the magnetic field generated by start field windings 32 could be reduced by use of a second dropper as shown in Fig. 23. The structure and operation of dropper 214 is well known to those skilled in the art and need not be detailed here. The dropper 214 controls the average power passing through the start field winding along line 200 by changing the pulse width or frequency or both of this signal. Line 200 is interrupted at point 215 in this embodiment and passes through the power terminals 217 of the dropper along lines 207 and 208. The power flowing through the power terminals is controlled by the control voltage at a second control input 216. This control voltage varies around a fixed bias level set by voltage divider resistoes 210, 211.Potentiometer 213 applies a portion of the negative outpslv voltage of tachometer 9 to control terminal 216 driving it more negative as vehicle speed increases. As the vclta e at second control input 216 becomes more negative, the average power flowing through the start field winding becomes less and less and is finally reduced to zero at high speeds. Although Figs. 2 and 6C show electric motors 1 as having two separately excitable field windings, in the preferred embodiment charge run field winding 31 is replaced by a permanent magnet. A 70, increase in efficiency in driving in electric drive and a 7 increase in effi ciency is achieved in this manner. Alternatively a series field winding could be used for the start field winding 32 and the permanent magnet used to replace charge run field winding 31. Such an arrangement would provide for the higher starting torques and regenerative braking efficiency of the series field arrangement. Simultaneously it would eliminate the need for the old teaser connection used in the prior art to initiate regenerative braking in series wound D.C.machines that were switched from electric drive to a battery charging configuration with consequent decay of magnetic field during the switching interval. The permanent magnet eliminates the need for momentarily switch ing some current through the series field winding to initiate current flow in the armature winding the function of the teazer connection. Since in the preferred embodiment some magnetic field is always present, electric motors 1 can be series wound D.C. machines with no additional requirement for a teazer connection in regenerative braking system 136. Referring now to Figs. 20, the pole pieces 218 for start field winding 32 are shown with permanent magnets 219 inserted in the centre of the pole piece. As shown inFig. 21B, start field winding 32 fits around pole piece 218 as shown. Permanent magnetic 219 may be any of the e ight grades of cermanic magnets or a Crucore Tm magnetic manufactured by Crucible Steel Company. The Crucore Tm magnet is preferred because of its superior strength. The magnetic properties and chemical compositions of both the ceramic and Crucore Tm magnets are specified in theMagnetic Materials Producers Association Standards.Permanent magnets 219 replaces charge run field winding 31 thereby saving the electrical energy formerly needed to create the charge run magnetic field and increasing the overall energy efficiency of the car by 14 i.e. 7 in the electric drive mode and 7 in the charging mode. Permanent magnets 219 can be rectangular as shown in Figs. 22, 22A and 22B. In either case, the magnetic flux lines leave the large faces 223 in Fig, 21 of the magnets generally perpendicular to the surfaces of these large faces. The opposing large faces of each permanent magnet 219 are of opposite magnetic polarity. Figure 21 is a closeup view in perspective of another embodiment of the modified pole pieces with permanent magnets 219 inserted in the ends of pole pieces 218.Fig. 21A is a side view of pole piece 218 seen from line 21A in Fig. 21. Non magnetic shields 220 separate the permanent magnets 219 from the projections 221 of pole pieces and from the rest of the pole piece as shown inFig. 21A. Non magnetic shields 220 essentially separate each pole piece 218 into three segments of magnetically conductive material separated by two shields of nonmagnetically conductive material. Consequently, magnetic flux lines from one pole of permanent magnets 219 are forced to spread out to the tips of pole pieces 218 rather than n short circuiting or returning by the shortest magnetic path 222 through to adjacent laminations of the pole pieces to the magnets opposite pole. Thus, nonmagnetic shields 220 interrupt the shortest magnetic path 222 through pole pieces 218 by presenting a higher magnetic reluctance to the magnetic force field lines than does the desired path.The desired path is out from the inside faces 227 of permanent magnets 219 and to the tip of the pole pieces, then down through the iron of the armature in a ram horn shape and back to the opposite poles on the inside faces 227 of the adjacent pole pieces on either side.The flux lines originating at the outside faces 223 of permanent magnets 219 pass through the soft ircrl motor casing 273 in Fig. 20 in a ram horn shape ze opposite magnetic poles at outside faces 223 of adjacent pole pieces. Referring now to Fig. 22 and 222, the preferred embodiment of the modified pole piece is shown. A slot 224 is cut in the pole piece 218 and a laminated or solid soft iron backing block is attached to the pole piece to give it additional strength. Referring now to Figs. 22A and B, the magnetic material is formed into a cylindrical shape. It is then segmented and individually magnetized as shown in Fig. 22A, or portions of the cylinder are magnetized with unmagnetized sections between them as shown in Fig. 22B. Magnetization of the cylinder segments or cylinder is oriented such that the inside faces 227 that are diagonally opposite each other have the same magnetic polarity.Referring again to Fig. 22, the magnetized segments or cylinder permanent magnet 219 are then press fitted or otherwise suitably secured in slot 224 Fig. 226 with non magnetic shield material 220 between the permanent magnets 219 and pole pieces 218. As in the other embodiments. the start field windings fit over the projections 221 and backing plate of pole pieces 218. With the complexity of the vehicles control and propulsion systems comes a procedure for changeover from heat engine to electric drive and vice versa which may be too complicated or difficult to remember for the average driver. Accordingly, a simplified changeover system has been incorporated to minimze this difficulty. Referring now to Figs. 6 and 16, an embodiment of such a changeover system for reducing the number of steps in changing from electric drive to heat engine drive is shown. When the driver switches mode switch 19, nowDPDT rather SPST as in Fig. 6, to the GAS position, a 12 volt signal from auxiliary battery 84 via ignition key switch 21 is applied to push button switch 228 in shift lever 17. Push button switch 228 is closed when depressed.It also will not allow shift lever 17 controlling transaxle 15 to be put in gear till the push button is depressed. When the vehicle is travelling above a certain speed, the heat engine can be started simply by depressing manual clutch 16, putting transaxle 15 into third or fourth gear and releasing manual clutch 16. This embodiment takes care of the clutch manipulation automatically. When the driver depresses push button switch 228 in preparing to place transaxle 15 into gear, the auxiliary battery voltage is applied to servo actuator 229 via mode switch 19 and ignition key switch 21 in Fig. 6A. When servo actuator 229 is energized, it pushes or pulls manual clutch 16 in disengaging it. After transaxle 15 is put in gear, push button switch 228 is released opening the circuit energizing servo actuator 229. Manual clutch 16 is released starting heat engine 14 when push button 28 is released. Referring now to Figs. 6A, B and 17, another embodiment of the changeover system is shown. When ignition key switch 21 is switched to IGNITION wiper 230 of relay 231 is energized from auxiliary battery 84. Relay 231 closes contacts 230 when energized by a sufficienl 79 high voltage from tachometer 9 in Fig. 6B along lines 25 and 232. When the voltage from tachometer 9 rises above the breakdown voltage of zener 233 indicating the vehicle is travelling at some predetermined speed, relay 231 is energized and the auxiliary battery voltage is applied through normally closed switches 234 and 235 to servo actuator 229. Again servo actuator 229 when energized pushes or pulls mechanical clutch 16 in thereby disengaging it.When shift lever 17 is moved to either the third or fourth gear position, either switch 235 or 2Z . is opened de energizing servo actuator 229 thereby releasing mechanical clutch 16 and starting the heat engine. In Figs. 18 and 18A, the preferred embodiment of the changeover system is shown. In this embodiment, the mechanical clutch pedal 16 determines mode the vehicle is operating in. A SPDT mode selection switch 236 replaces mode switch 19 in Fig. 6A. Mode selection switch 236 is actuated by the operation of mechanical clutch pedal 16. The single pole of mode selection switch 236 is energized along line 293 from auxiliary battery 84 through ignition key switch 21 and a section of direction selection switch 21. When mechanical clutch 16 is depressed, mode selection switch 19 energizes solenoid 53 in Fig. 4 along line 124 and de energizes the ignition of the heat engine.In this manner, the power plant speed control system 20 in Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 6A is placed in the electric drive configuration of Fig. 4 where accelerator pedal 18 controls the devices detailed earlier. When mechanical clutch 16 is undepressed, mode selection switch 236 de energizes solenoid 53 in Fig. 4 and energizes the heat engine ignition along line 239.Mechanical clutch 16 can be depressed either by a spring, by a servo actuator or by a combination of a spring and servo or manually. In the preferred embodiment shown inFig. 18A, mechanical clutch 16 is operated by a combination of a spring 240 and a linear servo actuator 229. Clutch pedal 16 pivots at fulcrum 241 and is attached to spring 240 at point 242. The other end of spring 240 is attached to servo actuator 229. Servo actuator 229 has a first input 291 and a second input 292. When the first input of servo actuator 229 is energized, it assumes the position shown in solid lines on Fig. 18A. In this position, clutch pedal 16 is depressed, and switch 236 places the vehicle in electric drive by energizing solenoid 53 in Fig. 3 along line 124.However, when the second input of linear servo actuator 229 is energized, actuator 229 assumes the position shown in phantom on Fig. 18A. Clutch pedal 16 is then undepressed and switch 236 senses this condition and places the vehicle in heat engine drive by energizing the ignition of the heat engine along line 239. The first and second inputs of linear actuator 229 are energized as shown in Fig. 18. Mode select switch 19 is mounted on gear shift lever 17 in this embodiment and has a GAS and ELECTRIC position, Mode select switch no longer directly controls solenoid 53 in the power plant speed control system but controls linear servo actuator 229 instead. In the ELECTRIC position, mode switch 19 energizes first input 291 of linear servo actuator 229 causing it to depress clutch pedal 16 by assuming the position shown in solid lines in Fig. 18A. When mode switch 19 is moved to the GAS position, line 294 to the wiper of relay 295 is energized. Relay 295 is connected to the output of a device such as tachometer 9 in Fig. 6B which generates a D.C. voltage proportional to the speed of the vehicle .When the speed reaches the predetermined level set by the breakdown voltage of zener diode 297 and the output characteristics of the speed sensing device, relay 295 is energized and its wiper makes contact with the contact connected to second input 292 energizing it.Linear servo actuator 229 then begins to move toward the position shown in phantom in Fig. 18A and stops there when limit switch 298 opens the current path. A similar limit switch 299 opens the circuit of the first input of linear servo actuator 229 when the first input is energized and the servo reaches the position of full depression of clutch pedal 18. The purpose of the combination of tachometer 9, zener diode 297 and relay 295 is to prevent release of clutch pedal 16 when mode switch 19 is moved to the GAS position when the vehicle is travelling below the predetermined speed a speed which would be too low to convert to heat engine drive. Placing zener diode 297 in series with the coil of relay 295 acts to eliminate the effect of hysteresis in the coil of relay 295 which would tend to make the relay drop out voltage lower than the relay pull in voltage. Virtual elimination of this hysteresis effect is accomplished by using a zener diode with a break down voltage substantially higher than either the pull in or drop out voltage of the relay coil.For example, if the relay pulls in at 1 volt and drops out at 1 3 of a volt across its coil, a 9 volt zener in series with the coil would result in a total pull in voltage of 10 volts and a total drop out voltage of 9 1 3 volts.The effect is to diminish the significance of the difference in coil voltage at pull in and drop out in relation to the total voltage across the zener coil combination at pull in and drop out. The result is pull in and drop out of relay 295 at roughly the same vehicle speed whether the vehicle has been accelerating or decelerating. This same effect has been incorporated in the overdrive system 30 in Fig. 2 discussed herein for causing relays 189 and 190 in the embodiment shown inFigs. 6B and C to pull in and drop out at approximately the saone vehicle speed whether the vehicle has been accelerating or decelerating. Zener diodes 187 and 188 serve to provide this effect. An additional embodiment of the vehicle is shown in Fig. 18. This embodiment provides for automatic changeover from electric drive to heat engine drive at the predetermined speed simply by adding wire 300 shown in phantom between mode switch 19 and the normally closed contact of relay 295. In this embodiment, when mode switch 19 is in the ELECTRIC position all electric drive would be employed regardless of vehicle speed. However, when mode switch 19 isgln the GAS position, the vehicle would remain in the electric drive configuration below the predetermined speed by virtue of the energization of first input 291 through lines 294, 300 and the normally closed contacts.However, when the predetermined speed is reached, relay 295 is energized and second input 292 is energized auto matically converting the vehicle to heat engine drive. As mentioned earlier, the uneven radii of turning causes undesirable loading while the vehicle is turning in electric motors 1 and the mechanical gears 3, shafts 7, and electric clutches 2 associated therewith.To eliminate this effect a differential turn system 132 is incorporated in the control input circuit of power controller 13. Referring now to Figs. 10, 11 and 6A, B,C, differential turn switch 132 is mounted at the front of the car with its operating lever actuated by two prongs 243 attached to steering gear tie rod 244. 7hen front wheels SA are turned, one of prongs 243 gives a turn signal by operating differential turn switch 132 causing normally open contacts 131 to open. Resistor 247 is then no longer shorted out by lines 245 and 246 and is inserted in series with potentiometer 66 of power plant speed control system 20 in Fig. 6A.Therefore, the control voltage sent to power controller 13 along line 76 from the wiper of potentiometer 66 is diminished by the additional voltage diuding effect caused by resistor 247.In this manner, the average power being fed to both motors is reduced simultaneously thereby preventing over heating of the motor on the rear wheel of the smaller radius turn. This is the preferred embodiment of this system. Another embodiment is shown in Fig. 12. There power controller 13 is shown to have a resistance ca ac tance frequency determining network connected to terminals 248 and 249 comprised of capacitor 250 and resistors 251 and 252. When differential turn switch 132 is generated contacts 131 open and resistor 252 is removed from its parallel connection across resistor 251. The change in resulting resistance lowers the frequency Or power controller 13 thereby lowering the average air fed to both electric motors 1. Relief is afforded in his manner to the motor driving the rear inside wheel which otherwise is turning too slowly for the power being fed to it. Yet another embodiment of this differential turn system is shown in Fig. 13. There differential turn switch 132 operates two sets of contacts 253 and 254 which are connected between auxiliary battery 84 and the coils of a pair of contactors 255 and 256. The power terminals of these contactors are connected to transmit chopped power around series resistors 257 and 258 to motor armatures 1A. When either contact 253 or 254 opens, the respective contactor is de energized and the chopped power for that particular motor armature is forced to pass through either resistor 257 or 258. Thus armature current in the motor on the inside of the turn is reduced and loading therein is minimized. Another embodiment of the differential turn system is shown in Fig. 14. In this version, differential turn switch pivots at 259 and operates potentiometers 260 and 261 in opposite directions for a given turn. These potentiometers individually control separate power controllers 13 each driving one of the electric motors.Potentiometers 260 and 261 each divide off a portion of a negative supply voltage from D.C. power source 266 and apply it to control inputs 262 and 263 in opposition to the 0 5 volt control voltage normally present there. The result is a decreasing pulse width to the inside motor as the potentiometer for the particular direction of turn applies an increasingly negative control voltage to its power controller. Charging the main battery 12 can impose a considerable mechanical load on rear wheels 5 in heat engine drive. To prevent excessive loading the heat engine when attempting to accelerate or climb a hill, a hill sensing and acceleration system is employed. Turning to Figure 15, mercury switch 267 is attached to car frame 29. Een the car accelerates or is climbing a hill, the mercury in switch 267 moves to the rear and grounds first output line 268. A time delay circuit 269 eliminates spurious grounds ing on first output line 268 for short periods of time from being reflected in a second output line 270. This time delay circuit may be a Motorola MC 14490 anti bounce chip. Capacitor 271 allows adjustment of the time delay. T Men line 268 is grounded for a time caused by a sustained acceleration or hill climb, output line 270 is grounded.Output line 270 is connected to control input 37 in Fig. 6 and effectively reduces the control signal there to zero volts thereby stopping charging and relieving mechanical loading of rear wheels 5.
