# ULTRASONIC APPARATUS, SYSTEM AND METHOD

## Abstract
Ultrasonic apparatus for use in detecting an object hav ing a transducer. The transducer has an array of at least one element coupled directly into air. The apparatus also includes a transmitter 36 which may be multi channel, a receiver 36 which may be multi channel, a transmit re ceive switch 33 , and a computer 42 for causing operation of said transmit receive switch to cause sequential supply ing of pulses of energy from the transmitter to the element or elements 31 of the transducer and for receiving energy received by the transducer. The element or elements of the transducer are provided with a roughened surface to pro duce high frequency ultrasonic energy.
