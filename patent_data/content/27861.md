# Typewriter including an apparatus for repositioning a printing element upon power return.

## Abstract
An electric typewriter includes a random access mem ory 23 for storing selected characters to be printed and for storing data relating to the present escapement position and future escapement destination of a print head 3 of the typewriter. A control unit 21 operates a printer 1 to print the stored characters in the memory unit and, when a power interrupt occurs and power is subsequently restored, the control unit 21 accesses particular position data in the memory in accordance with the angular posi tion of a print shaft 15 of the typewriter at the time of the power interrupt. The accessed data is employed to define a proper return escapement position for the printing head 3 of the typewriter.
