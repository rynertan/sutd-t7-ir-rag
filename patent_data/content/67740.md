# PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR IMPROVING GAS RECOVERY IN A PRESSURE SWING ADSORPTION SYSTEM

## Abstract
The invention deals with a process and an apparatus for improving product gas recovery in a pressure swing adsorp tion system having at least three adsorbent beds. Void space gas is released from an adsorbent bed 3 at a higher adsorption pressure by cocurrent depressurization of the bed. The released gas is passed to another bed 4 of a pressure swing adsorption system to equalize the pressure therebetween, the other bed being initially at a lower pressure. A portion of the product effluent withdrawn from yet another bed 1 of the system is not passed to the bed 4 undergoing repressurization, as in conventional practice, but is passed to an external repressurization storage tank 13 during said pressure equalization step. Upon completion of this step, the product effluent is withdrawn from the repressurization tank and passed to said bed 4 undergoing repressurization. This process enhances the recovery of product gas such as purified hydrogen in hydrogen containing feed gas mix tures containing carbon dioxide.
