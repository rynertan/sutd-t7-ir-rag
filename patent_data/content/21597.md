# HEAT TRANSFER APPARATUS FOR RELEASABLY SECURING HEATING OR COOLING MEANS TO PIPE

## Abstract
A heat transfer apparatus 13 adapted to releasably secure an elongate heating or cooling means to a pipe. Apparatus 13 has a flexible base member 3 that adapts to the radius of curvature of the outer circumference of the pipe and preferably has at least one protuberance 8 in its wall. One or two resilient side walls 4 extend over the side of base member 3 that faces away from the pipe to provide a longitudinal cavity for containing the heating or cooling means. An entrance way 6 is provided for inserting or removing the heating source into or from the cavity. Side walls 4 are shaped such that they press uniformly against the heating or cooling means and urge said means against base member 3 . Means 11 are provided for securing apparatus 13 to the pipe so the heating or cooling means can be removed from or inserted into the cavity without having to release apparatus 13 from the pipe.
