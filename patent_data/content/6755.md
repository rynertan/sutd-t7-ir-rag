# Drip irrigation system and flow control valve therefor.

## Abstract
A drip irrigation system includes a flow control valve 10 having an inlet opening 16 which constricts in re sponse to pressure increases to provide a uniform flow despite pressure variations. The inlet opening 16 of the valve has a rectangularly cross sectioned central section and end sections which are non rectangular, such as trian gular or semi circular, in cross section. During normal flow conditions the rectangular central section of the inlet open ing is pressed closed and irrigation liquid flows at a con stant rate through the two end sections.
