# BRUSH SEALS

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a brush seal which compris es producing a plurality of tufts of brush material and securing the tufts betveen two side plates to form a seal. Each tuft is produced by forming a tape which comprises one or more layers of parallel contiguous lengths of filaments adhesively bonded together to form a self supporting body. The tape is cut into discrete portions and these consti tute tufts of bonded filaments. A plurality of tufts are assembled closely adjacent to each other in a support member with a part of each tuft projecting from the support member, and the tufts are subsequently secured in the support member. Finally the adhesive is removed from at least that part of each tuft which projects from the support member.
