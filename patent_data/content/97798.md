# Fiber optic scanner system.

## Abstract
A fiber optic scanner system 10 for reading coded patterns is provided having a single optical fiber extending from the reading end of the scanner tip to a remote terminal 36 . The remote terminal includes an optical signal gener ator 44 for generating and driving light pulses along the single optical fiber to the reading end of the scanner member so as to illuminate a bar code and obtain reflected pulses therefrom which are carried to the remote terminal receiver 46 and decoded.
