# Vacuum document feeder.

## Abstract
An automatic vacuum document feeder includes a document stack support tray 38 for documents to be fed seriatim from the stack to a utilization device, such as the document platen of a convenience copier. The vacuum cups are disposed in the direction of belt movement downstream of the source of vacuum for the belt. A document lifter transport assembly 12 includes a pair of vacuum cups 72, 73 carried by vacuum lifter assemblies 34, 36 which can be reciprocated in a vertical linear path. The vacuum cups descend and lift the topmost document along a vertical path to a position above the stack and beyond the bottom surface of a vacuum transport belt 30 . The vacuum belt moves to transport the document in a plane perpendicular to the vertical path of the vacuum lifter. Vacuum to the vacuum cups is disconnected as the vacuum belt attracts the lifted document so that the document is transferred from the cups to the belt with little or no relative motion occurring between the document and the cups or transport belt in contact therewith. A document restraint device, including air jets and stripper fingers, coacts with the stack to eliminate double feed.
