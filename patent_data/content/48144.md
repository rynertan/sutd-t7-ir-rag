# X ray photographic inspecting device.

## Abstract
An X ray photographic inspecting device for inspecting a welded part such as, for example, a vertical welded part on a wall to be inspected e.g. the wall of a metal tank, has a body 1 movable at the upper edge of the wall to be inspected and supported by legs 4, 5 on the wall to be inspected, an X ray generator 6 elevationally movably hung on a guide rail 4 vertically provided at the body, and a penetrameter 11 mounted on a penetrameter support 12 provided at the X ray generator 6 . This device can be operated by a single worker or operator using an operational panel 32 on a gondola 24 , such as elevationally driving the X ray gener ator and the gondola, fixing the body to the wall with magnets or releasing the fixture of the body, urging the penetrameter on to the wall to be inspected, bonding a film used in the penetrameter to the opposite side of the wall to be inspected, and conducting the X ray photographing of the welded part on the wall to be inspected.
