# Wear resistant molybdenum iron boride alloy and method of making same.

## Abstract
A wear resistant, iron molybdenum boride alloy is dis closed as is a method of making it. The alloy has a micros tructure comprising a primary boride phase and a matrix phase. The primary boride phase comprises molybdenum alloyed with iron and boron, and the matrix phase comprises one of iron boron in iron and iron molybdenum in iron and has a hardness less than that of the primary boride phase. The subject alloy generally has an average hardness level above 1550 Kg mmÂ² Knoop to 500 gram load finds particular utility in a composite material on a ground engaging tool such as a cutting edge or ripper tooth, and can also be used for wear resistant coatings, machine tool inserts, bearings, and the like.
