# Refractory metal coated metal working dies.

## Abstract
Metal working dies which are typically made of steel are provided with substantially enhanced life by receiving a plas ma sprayed refractory metal coating which is subsequently compacted under conditions of minimum shear stress. The number of working cycles which can be obtained from a die before it is necessary to rework the die can be improved by as much as 3500 .
