# Method of destroying a brittle body.

## Abstract
An elastic tube 4 which may have a plastic wire 5 inserted or a heat fusible member for defining a charging hole is previously buried in a brittle body 2 in a relation partly exposed at the surface of the brittle body 2 , and, after pulling out the elastic tube 4 or fusing the heat fusible member, an expansive splitting agent is charged into the charging hole and subjected to hydration expansion to destroy the brittle body 2 . In another form, a water impermeable film enclosing an expansive splitting agent therein is previously buried in a brittle body in a relation partly exposed at the surface of the brittle body, and, after aperturing the exposed end of the water impermeable film, the expansive splitting agent is subjected to hydration expansion to destroy the brittle body. Particularly, the brittle body is a dental working cast which can be destroyed to take out a denture therefrom without damaging the denture.
