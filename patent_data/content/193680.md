# Films of blends of linear ethylene polymers and aromatic polymers.

## Abstract
Linear low density copolymers LLDPE are blended with up to about 10 weight percent of an aromatic polymer, e.g., polystyrene or poly para methylstyrene , to give films having improved MD tear strength or equivalent MD tear strength and higher stiffness compared to the LLDPE alone. Also, extruder torque is lower and bubble stability is greater in blown film extrusion with the blends as well as in blends in which medium or high density polyethylene is used instead of the LLDPE.

## Description
FILMS OF BLENDS OF LINEAR ETHYLENE POLYMERS AND AROMATIC POLYMERS Linear low and medium density polyethylene copolymers LLDPE , and linear high density polyethylene are known materials which are widely commercially available LLDPE is also described in U.S. Patent 4,076,698. A commercially important use of LLDPE is in films which are conventionally prepared by blown film extrusion. Such films have generally good properties but often exhibit undesirably low stiffness for some uses and have marginal MD tear characteristics. In accordance with this invention, MD tear can be improved by blending LLDPE with aromatic polymers such as polystyrene or poly paramethylstyrene . Alternatively, the stiffness of LLDPE can be improved without loss of MD machine direction tear.At the same time processing is improved, particularly in reduced extruder torque and in better bubble stability in the blown film. This invention provides films comprising blends of linear ethylene polymers and small amounts of, up to about 10 weight percent, aromatic polymers such as polystyrene or poly para methylstyrene . This invention also provides a method for reducing extruder torque in the extrusion of low pressure linear ethylene polymers by blending therein an effective amount of a thermoplastic polymer of an aromatic hydrocarbon. The present invention further provides a method for increasing bubble stability in the blown film extrusion of low pressure ethylene polymers by blending an effective amount of a thermoplastic polymer of an aromatic hydrocarbon with the low pressure ethylene polymer. In accordance with this invention, the MD tear strength of ethylene polymers, particularly LLDPE can be improved or, as is often desirable, the same MD tear strength can be obtained in a film of greater stiffness see Secant modulus .This is accomplished by blending up to about 10 weight percent preferabiy up to about 8 weight percent, and most preferably between about 3 and 8 weight percent of an aromatic polymer The ethylene polymers which are suitable for use in this invention are those prepared by low pressure techniques. Many such polymers are commercially available.Particularly suitable are LLDPE resins which are copolymers of ethylene and higher olefins, particularly 1butene, 1 hexene, and 1 octene. These LLDPE copolymers generally have a density of between 0.90 and 0.94, preferably between 0.91 and 0.93 gm cmt Polystyrene and poly para methylstyrene resins are particularly suitable as the aromatic polymer which is blended with the ethylene polymer. Preferably, the aromatic polymer is selected so that its melt viscosity is less than the melt viscosity of the ethylene resin used. The disparity in viscosity appears to contribute to better Eimendorf tear strength of the blends. Also, the best tear strength is obtained with blends in which the LLDPE itself has good tear properties.Such blends result in films with good tear and impact properties, and the higher modulus characteristic of a higher density LLDPE film. Competibilizers can be used in small amounts up to about 2 weight percent of the composition. Suitable compatibilizers include block copolymers of styrene ethylene propylene styrene Kraton G , block copolymers of styrene and ethylene Shelvis and ethylene propylene copolymers Vistalon 3707 . The resin blends and films are made in the conventional manner. Preferably, films are made by blown film extrusion using conventional techniques to obtain films which are generally from about 0.013 to 0.13mm 0.5 to 5 mils in thickness.

GPX 1 and GP 2 are ethylene butene copolymers having a density of about 0.918 and Melt Indexes of about 1 and 2 respectively. The PPMS is a free radical catalyzed resin having aMw of about 300,000 and a Mw Mn of about 3.5.EXAMPLE 17 Substitution of polystyrene for the PPMS in Example 10, in amounts of 8 to 10 weight percent gives a blend with enough elasticity to give a stable bubble at higher output rates than the LLDPE alone. Films made of the blend exhibit similar or improved MD tear compared toLLDPE alone but with a desirable increase in stiffness Secant Modulus .EXAMPLE 12 Blends of ethylene hexene copolymer and polystyrene gave films with improved stiffness and acceptable MD tear strength for that stiffness. Suitable ethylene hexene copolymers include a copolymer having a Melt Index of 0.75 and a density of 0.927 and a copolymer having a MeltIndex of 1.0 and a density of 0 92.
