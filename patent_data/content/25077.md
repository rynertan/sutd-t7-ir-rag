Voltage peaks in the primary circuit, in the secondary circuit and in the current measuring circuit and cut off by means of Zener diodes 4,24,33 . This measuring system is simple due to the two wire measuring circuit and has an intrinsic safety partially due to the galvanic separation of the measuring circuit from the power circuit and the Zener diodes avoiding excess voltages in all circuits.

## Description
A two wire or life zero measuring systemThis invention relates to a two wire or life zero measuring system with galvanic separation and of particular simplicity.Measuring systems fulfilling the requirements of intrinsic safety PTB may include galvanic separation of the power source and electronic circuits on one hand, and of the measuring element or probe on the other hand, by electro optical couplers or transformers, and they include two converters or transformers, for energizing the measuring element, and for transmitting a signal corresponding to the measured value respectively.This invention aims to provide a two wire or life zero measuring system of high simplicity, linearity and intrinsic safety. The measuring system according to this invention comprises a direct current supply circuit and a transformer, means for delivering DC pulses from said DC supply circuit to a primary winding of said transformer at a frequency above the frequency of dynamic phenomena to be measured, a variable impedance measuring means connected to said secondary winding and means for measuring the mean current flow in said primary winding. It has been found that such a measuring system has an excellent linearity, intrinsic safety due to the galvanic separation of the measuring element from the remaining measuring circuits and from the power source, low power rating, and simplicity due to the fact that one transformer only is required.Since the system measures the current flowing in the primary circuit, this current depending on the current flowing in the secondary circuit including the measuring element, it is important to perfectly stabilize the voltage of the order that the current flow in the primary circuit does not depend on this voltage but only on the impedance of the measuring element. Zener diodes or similar elements are connected in parallel to the power input in the primary circuit and in parallel to the measuring circuit or secondary circuits in order to cut off and prevent any excessive voltage peaks and power transfer in each of these circuits, whereby the intrinsic safety is ensured.Preferably the frequency of pulses delivered to the primary winding of the transformer should be relatively high, for instance in the order of 200 kHz, this allowing measurement of dynamic phenomena up to relatively high frequencies, in the order of 50 kHz, without significant attenuation. Further, due to the relatively high operating frequency a transformer having relatively small numbers of turns and having thus a low capacitance may be used, this being particularly favourable because differences in voltage between the primary and secondary circuits are practically without effect. It is also relatively easy to obtain insuation of the windings of the transformers for high voltages, for instance up to 4 000 V.In order to reduce the effects of the impedance of the transmission line between the secondary transformer winding and the measuring element, an impedance converter is preferably connected to the secondary winding allowing transmission and reading of the measuring current signal at low impedance.The system may operate at a very low power level in the secondary or measuring circuit, this being in agreement with international standards for intrinsic safety.Further details of the invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawing showing by way of example an embodiment of the measuring system and wherein Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram and Fig. 2 schematically shows the principle of measure ment in a modified embodiment.The circuit shown in Fig. 1 has power input terminals and 0 for a suitable voltage, for example 24 V. A first stabilizing circuit 1 delivers a stable output voltage at a suitable level for being applied to inputs of a DC measuring amplifier 2 in a manner explained below. Input is connected through a fuse 3 to two Zener diodes 4 serving to prevent undesired voltage peaks at the power input. The system comprises an oscillator 5 operating at high frequency, for instance 200 kHz. The output of oscillator 5 is connected to the gate of a vMOS tran sistor 6. Connected to the input power terminals is a second voltage stabilizer 7 having a very stable output of low impedance, such that the voltage is independent of the current consumed.The output of stabilizer 7 is connected to a primary winding 8 of a high frequency transformer, winding 8 being connected in series with transistor 6. The transformer further has a secondary winding 9 and an intermediate recuperation winding 10 connected in series with a diode 11. The secondary winding 9 is connected via diodes 12 to a filter comprising a resistor 13, capacitors 14 and an inductor 15. The high frequency signal induced in secondary winding 9 is thus rectified and a direct voltage of constant value is fed to an impedance transformer having a voltage divider comprising resistors 16 und 17, a capacitor 18 and a Zener diode 19 in parallel with resistor 17, a transistor 20 and a base resistor 21. A direct current measuring element 23 having a variable resistance, such as a strain gauge or other, is connected to the output terminals 22 of the impedance transformer.Zener diodes 24 are connected in parallel with the output termin als 22 for cutting off any voltage peaks which might appear at these terminals. A relatively long two wire transmission line may be connected between terminals 22 and the measuring element 23.The pulsating current flowing through transistor 6 also flows through a measuring resistor 25 connected in series with transistor 6 and primary winding 8 respectively. A low pass filter comprising capacitors 26 and 27, inductors 28 and a resistor 29 is connected in parallel with the measuring resistor 25, a direct voltage corresponding to the mean voltage drop at the measuring resistor 25 appearing at the output 30 of the filter. This voltage is further filtered by capacitors 31 and 32 and possible voltage peaks are cut off by Zener diodes 33. The voltage at the output 30 is transmitted to the one input terminal of amplifier 2 through a fuse 34 and a resistor 35, the DClevel at this input being adjusted by means of a potentiometer 36. The gain of the amplifier 2 is adjusted by another potentiometer 37 connected to the other input. The output of amplifier 2 is the output 38 of the measuring system.As explained above, pulses of constant voltage are applied to the primary winding 8 of the transformer at high frequency, for instance 200 kHz, and the voltage induced in the secondary winding is rectified and applied to the measuring element 23. The impedance of the primary winding 8 depends on the current flow in the secondary winding 9, and this current flow depends on the current flow in the measuring element 23. If no measuring element is connected there will be no current, the impedance at the primary winding 8 is high and the current flowing therein is low.It has been found that with the system as described the mean current flowing in the primary winding is a linear function of the value of the measuring element 23 over a wide range of measurement. The voltage peaks induced in the intermediate winding 10 of the transformer when the current in the primary winding 8 is chopped by transistor 6 are cut off by current flow through diode 11 and intermediate winding 10 whereby energy is recuperated and the energy consumption of the system is reduced.Fig. 2 schematically illustrates the principle of the measuring system. A DC supply voltage is transmitted to the measuring element through a DC DC converter U U and the current flowing in the measuring element is transmitted through a current voltage converter I U to the measuring amplifier and output 38 of the system. The terminals and broken lines in Fig. 2 indicate that a cable of desired length may be connected between the measuring circuits and the measuring element. Fig. 2 further shows that a controlled current source may be provided instead of a simple measuring element. In this case the measuring element 23 which may be an active element such as a piezoelectric crystal or the like is connected to the input of an amplifier 40 of which the output controls the current source 41. With such a controlled current source the system becomes substantially independent of fluctuations of the operating voltage.The measuring system as herein described may be used for measuring quasi static as well as dynamic phenomena at frequencies up to about 50 kHz if the operating frequency is of the order of 200 kHz. Passive measuring elements such as strain gauges or active elements such as piezoelectric crystals may be used. The operating frequency may be increased in order to measure dynamic phenomena of higher frequencies.
