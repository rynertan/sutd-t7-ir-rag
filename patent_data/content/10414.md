# Process and apparatus for separating gaseous phosphorus trichloride from a gas stream, and apparatus for producing liquid phosphorus trichloride.

## Abstract
A process for separating phosphorus trichloride from a phosphorus trichloride containing gas stream characterised in that a the gas stream is contacted with a condensing amount of liquid phosphorus trichloride to condense a portion of the gaseous phosphorus trichloride to liquid phosphorus trichloride and b the liquid phosphorus trichloride is separated from the gas stream and an apparatus for the realization of this process is disclosed. The process is particularly useful in preventing or reduc ing the discharge of gaseous phosphorus trichloride to the atmosphere due to the accidental discharge of a high volume gas stream from a phosphorus trichloride reaction vessel.
