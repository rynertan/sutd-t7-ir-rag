## Abstract
An inner shell 46 having aligned first and second expansion chambers 54, 58 ist spacedly disposed in an outer shell 66 in a manner to define therebetween four isolated chambers 72, 74, 76, 78 upstreamly positioned two of which surround the first expansion chamber and down streamly positioned two of which surround the second ex pansion chamber. The first expansion chamber is connect ed through respective flanged openings 62, 64 to the up streamly positioned isolated chambers to allow these cham bers to show a sound damping effect. The upstream and downstream portions of the second expansion chamber are connected through respective groups of perforations 84, 86, 88, 90 to the downstreamly positioned isolated chambers to allow these chambers to show a sound damping effect.
