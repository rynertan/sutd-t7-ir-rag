# Bed with programmable temperature compartment.

## Abstract
A device for use during epidermic and depth treatments on the human body as well as during post operative care, consisting of a couch 1 on which a box like covering and continuous structure 4 is fitted so as to provide a closed space equipped with temperature conditioning means 9 adapted to the requirements of the human body, which device can be used on areas of the body which are bare or not covered by blankets. The inner space is limited by a transversally arranged curtain 4 hung at the upper end 6 of the inside of the structure, the bottom of which rests on the surface of the couch, against the lower end of the pillow. In this way, the patient will have his head exposed, whilst the rest of the body will be contained in the temperature controlled space.

## Claims
CLAIMS l Bed with programmable temperature compartment,characterized by the fact that a device is foreseen which substantially permits to the lying person to keep the head in the building room, while his body lies in another ambient that can be pre arranged according to the different requirements of employ by the sa me operator or by third persons employed in the treatments.This is feasible because a box continuous structure is used which is partially laid oh the couch to form a lodgement for a human body delimited by a preclusion curtain transversally fitted, while the head remains in contact with the outer room. 2 Bed with programmable temperature compartment,according to the above claim, characterized by the fact that this compartme nt is accessible from the box wall through a differently operated door. 3 Bed with programmable temperature compartment,according to the above claims,characterized by the fact that the compartme nt is foreseen to be equipped with conditioning device of dif ferent kind and form according to the treatments to carry out. 4 Bed with programmable temperature compartment,according to the above claims,characterized by the fact that the device in cludes couch 1 with cushion 2 on which box 4 is brought by me ans of movement on rolls 3. 5 Bed with programmable temperature compartment,according to the above claims,characterized by the fact that the inner spa ce preclusion is carried out by curtain 5 fitted on guides 6. 6 Bed with programmable temperature compartment,according to the above claims,characterized by the fact that the access to the couch is possible through door 7 gliding on guide 8. 7 Bed with programmable temperature compartment,according to the above claims,characterized by tha fact that conditioner 9, with inner IO and outer 11 control boards, is foreseen for the adaptation of the inside ambient. 8 Execution form as described and illustrated by drawings of Tab le 1. On behalf.

## Description
Bed with programmable temperature compartment The invention refers to a couch partially contained in a continuous box structure fit for determining a compartment equipped with temperature conditioning means according to the human body requirements. This permits to lodge the body without garments.The inside space fit for maintaining the programmed ambient co nditions is barred by a transversally disposed curtain which, hanging from the structure top,at the inner compartment limit, sinks on the couch in correspondence to the inside pillow limit.The lying person will thus have his head in contact with the ou ter room and the body contained in a conditionable ambient.The apparatus allows employ particularities in epidermic as well as depth treatments of the human body and in the postoperative cou rses.As a bed conventional employ,the invention permits to exclude the employ of blankets, thus permitting rest and movements to members completely relaxed since not loaded with weights and fa stenings.When the human body is lying, its temperature tends to sink,and an emission of its energy outwards can be noted by mea ns of thermic exchange.To allow the maintenance of the human body temperature,blankets are used which operate for retaining the body heat,while the he ad remains in contact with the outside ambient. This exigency of maintaining the head at a temperature generally not corre sponding to the one foreseen for the body is particularly no ticed in the epidermic and depth treatments and in postopera tive courses,where an ambient to quickly condition according to the operative exigencies is specifically required.If the building conditions should be conditioned to the opera tive requirements,a waste of energy would be caused,a room du ly prepared to this purpose should be required and heavy discomfort would arise to the lying person.The invention permits the solution of these problems by adopting a device which substantially allows to the lying person to keep his head in the building ambient,while his body is in another space suited to the different requirements of employ from the part of the operator himself or of third persons employed for the treatments.This is possible thanks to the fact that a box continuous stru cture is used,partially laid on the couch to form a lodging co mpartment for the human body, delimited by a preclusion curtain transversally fitted,while the head remains in contact with the outer room. This compartment is accessible from the box wall by means of a door to operate in different ways.The compartment is foreseen equipped with conditioning devices of different kinds and forms according to the treatments to carry out.An execution form is illustrated by the drawings of Table 1,whe re Fig.l is the view of the device longitudinal section showing the couch on which an undressed human body is lying in conventi onal rest position,with the head leaning on the cushion,and pre clusion the inner space obtained by means of the curtain which if drawn down closes the ambient in correspondence to the cushi on inner side.Fig.2 is the view of two components separated the couch with cushion and the box apparatus.Fig.3 is the pro spectic view of the device showing the head of the lying person resting on the cushion and the access door.According to the version, the apparatus includes couch 1 with cushion 2,on which box 4 is brought by means of movement on rolls 3.The in ner space preclusion is performed by curtain 5 fitted on guid es 6.The access to the couch is possible through door 7 sliding sideways on guide 8.For the adjustment of the inside ambient,conditioner 9 is foreseen with inside 10 and outside 11 control boards.Practically,the form of the components, of the different devices,of the accessories and everything el se in order may be differently carried out.
