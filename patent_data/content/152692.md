# A method of increasing the vertical resolution of well log data.

## Abstract
In a well logging technique, measured parameters which are inherently weighted average measurement values are inverse filtered to improve the resolution of the measured values. A processing technique is employed, wherein higher resolution values of logged measurements are obtained from information contained in the measurements themselves, and the response function of a logging tool without emulating a white noise driven system.
