# APPARATUS FOR AUTOMATICALLY FIXING A CARCASS

## Abstract
An apparatus for automatic fixing a vertically suspended carcass, comprising a carriage 3 moved vertically by a cylinder 5 , the carriage is equipped with two plates set at an angle to form a funnel like guiding device 10 for catching and guiding the snout of the carcass. The carriage is furthermore provided with another cylinder 6 for horizontal movement of a fixing tool formed as a hook 7 into and out of the guiding device 10 . The carcass may be fixed as follows the carriage 3 with the guiding device 10 is moved upwards towards the snout of the carcass, whereby the snout is caught by the guiding device. When the snout arrives at the bottom of the guiding device the upwards movement of the carriage 8 is stopped. The hook 7 is then moved into engagement with the lower jaw in order to stretch, center and fix the carcass during a suc cessive splitting operation. As a result the hook 7 is placed with a high degree of ac curacy in the lower jaw and the carcass is stretched, centered and fixed correctly for the splitting operation, even if the shape and length of the carcass deviate considerably from those of a standard carcass.
