## Description
The present invention relates to bacterial agricultural products, including Rhizobium inoculants, and methods for making and preserving such agricultural products. It is well known that leguminous plants under certain conditions fix nitrogen directly from the air and convert it to organic nitrogenous compounds, thereby providing nitrogen to the plant for protein synthesis and also enriching the soil around the leguminous plants by leaving nitrogenous nutrients in the soil for later crops. In actual fact, of course, the plants themselves do not fix nitrogen, but the nitrogen fixation occurs in Rhizobium bacteria which exist symbiotically with the legumes in nodules formed in the roots of the plants. Examples of leguminous plants which are capable of symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria are peas, beans, alfalfa, red clover, white clover, vetch, lupines, and the like. Other agriculturally important non leguminous plants, such as grasses and grains, are unable to fix nitrogen directly from the air. Non Leguminous plants generally depend entirely upon combined nitrogen in the soil, such as nitrates and ammonium salts for nitrogen for protein synthesis. After a series of such crops have been grown on any given field, the combined nitrogen in the soil becomes depleted. Consequently, crop rotation is often practiced, whereby nitrogen fixing plants are grown in rotation with non nitrogen fixing plants to replenish soil nitrogen. Furthermore, some legumes, particularly soybeans, peas, beans and alfalfa, are commercially important as crops themselves, and the growth of these crop plants is greatly facilitated by ample combined nitrogen availability. The particular Rhizobium bacteria necessary to a given nitrogen fixing plant may not be universally present in the soil. Different Rhizobium species are adapted to form nodules only in legumes of specific species. Therefore, it is a quite common practice to inoculate the seeds of leguminous plants with an appropriate culture of Rhizobium bacteria. The inoculation can be done by coating the seeds, dusting planted seeds or crops, or by spreading inoculant in the furrows of planted leguminous seeds. One method of inoculating leguminous seeds is to maintain the Rhizobium bacteria culture in an active living state, by mixing a moist culture of the bacteria with a carrier such as humus or peat. The carrier maintains the bacteria in a moist, living state. However, the shelf life of such live bacterial cultures can be relatively short, because the bacteria die under conditions of storage due to the relative shortage of food and moisture in their environment. An example of a moist type of inoculant mixture is described in U.S. Patent No. 2,726,948 to Another method of preparing legume seed inoculants is to convert the bacteria culture to a state of dormancy. One known method used to create dormant bacteria is freeze drying, as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,168,796 to Although freeze drying Rhizobium bacteria prior to mixing with a carrier usually gives a high initial recovery, the bacteria do not always remain stable for long storage periods. Therefore, it would be advantageous to provide a dry, dormant Rhizobium inoculant which can be easily prepared and which will be stable over fairly long storage times with high yields of viable Rhizobium upon re exposure to moisture. It is known from EP 17565A to incorporate a bacteria such as Rhizobium into a polymeric, preferably polysaccharide, gel. The gel mixture may then be dried by the additional step of adding a powder such as silica. It has now been found that good results may be obtained without the need for the polysaccharide gel. Some have suggested that other, non Rhizobium, bacteria may be beneficial to some crop plants. Many terrestrial bacterial species are known and it is quite possible that some may be particularly helpful in the cultivation of field crops because of symbiotic relationships formed between plant and bacteria. In the event such associations are identified, it would become necessary to be able to effectively deliver the bacteria to the field in order to take advantage of this symbiosis. According to the present invention, there is provided a method for making an agriculturally useful inoculant of dormant bacteria, characterised in that it comprises only the steps of The dormant bacteria may be either Rhizobium or any other useful species. It is an object of the present invention to provide a bacterial inoculant in which the bacteria will be dormant and easily handleable, yet in which the bacteria will be stable and viable during extended storage time. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a seed coating for legumes which includes a Rhizobium inoculant in which the coating and the seed will be stable during long storage periods. The present invention discloses a method for making an agriculturally useful composition including a viable bacterial component, especially useful with Rhizobium bacteria. The bacteria culture itself can be efficiently grown either on a semisolid support such as AMA agar or in the liquid state AMA liquid . After a suitable bulk quantity of the appropriate desired strain of Rhizobium or other bacteria has been cultured, the bacteria are harvested from the culture medium. Suitable Rhizobium species include Once the Rhizobium bacteria have been substantially separated from the culture medium, the bacteria are maintained at a temperature in the range of about 0 to 30 C for a period in the range of about 0 to 96 hours under aseptic conditions. Preferably, the bacterial suspension is maintained at a temperature in the range of about 22 to 30 C, i.e. a normal room temperature, for a period in the range of about 3 to 25 hours under aseptic conditions, followed by further maintaining the bacterial suspension at a temperature in the range of about 0 to 15 C for a period in the range of about 3 to 20 hours under aseptic conditions. The bacteria are maintained as a concentrated liquid suspension during this step. At this stage, after the bulk of the liquid medium has been removed, the bacteria are no longer actively growing. For Rhizobium, the density should be on the order of 10⁷ to 10¹² bacteria per milliliter. The concentrated bacteria suspension should be a dense liquid appearing more like a viscous paste. The concentrated bacterial suspension is then mixed with a porous, chemically inert granular carrier such that the weight ratio of concentrated bacteria suspension to dry carrier is in the range of about 0.5 to 1.5, preferably about 1.0. Examples of suitable carriers include vermiculite, perlite, and charcoal. If charcoal is used, a saturated saccharide solution, preferably selected from the group consisting of sucrose, lactose, trehalose, sorbitol and adonital, is added to the bacterial suspension prior to the step of maintaining the bacteria at 0 to 30 C. The weight of the saturated saccharide solution added to the bacteria suspension is in a ratio in the range of about 0.5 1.5, preferably about 1.0 by weight. Charcoal carriers are advantageous and may be preferable for some applications because the charcoal may absorb Rhizobium toxic compounds, such as alkaloids and lignin compounds, which are naturally released by many legume seeds during germination. Next, the bacteria carrier mixture is slowly dried, preferably in air, at about room temperature, i.e. 22 to 30 C, for a period of about 2 to 10 days under aseptic conditions. The exact time period will, of course, vary depending on the concentration of bacteria in the liquid culture. The drying should continue until the bacteria carrier mixture appears totally dried. The remaining moisture content of the dried mixture should approximate the relative humidity of the environment. The composition resulting after the completion of drying includes dried, dormant yet viable Rhizobium together with the porous granular carrier in a loose cake. The cake is readily friable to yield a clumped, coarsely granular product. This granular product may or may not be re ground to a more powdery form depending on the particular delivery strategy to be used. Thus, depending on the delivery procedure to be used, the bacteria carrier mixture can then be ground to a relatively fine powder for use in dusting or coating directly on legume seeds with or without an adhesive or can be dusted on the field before or during planting. Alternatively coarser granuler bacteria carrier mixture might not be ground, and then the dried granular mixture can be easily and directly introduced into the furrows during planting to inoculate the seeds. Thus the material produced from the drying of the bacteria carrier mixture is readily adaptable to various delivery methods as may be desired for any given application. A Rhizobium inoculated leguminous seed coating prepared by the present invention would include a mixture of Rhizobium bacteria together with a porous, chemically inert carrier, wherein the bacteria carrier mixture has been air dried to a substantially moisture free state. The weight ratio of concentrated bacteria culture to dry carrier should be in the range of about 0.5 to 1.5, preferably about 1.0. Any of the Rhizobium species mentioned above can be used in this leguminous seed coating. The preferable carrier is selected from the group consisting of vermiculite, perlite, and charcoal. When charcoal is selected, the leguminous seed coating further includes a saccharide. The saccharide is introduced in a saturated solution to the bacterial suspension at a weight ratio of saccharide solution to bacterial suspension in the range of about 0.5 1.5, preferably about 1.0. Examples of suitable saccharides include sucrose, lactose, trehalose, sorbitol and adonital. It may be preferable to grind the dried bacteria carrier mixture prior to coating the leguminous seed. If so, such grinding is preferably done after the mixture has been air dried. While this method is particularly useful for Rhizobium species for which presently recognized agriculture uses exist, it has also been found useful in drying viable cultures of other non Rhizobium species, whether for agricultural or other applications. The following non limitative examples are intended to illustrate the present invention. The bacteria used in this Example was a strain of In this Example, In this Example, a In this example, another In this example, another In this example, the same method was tested on two non Rhizobium bacteria. Two bacterial cultures, designated LAlc 2 and LAlc 6, were isolated from the roots of soybean plants in the state of Louisiana. Neither culture will nodulate a legume, as does Rhizobium. Both cultures are bacillus shaped, LAlc 2 being a long bacillus while LAlc 6 is short, while Rhizobium is, of course, a short rod shape. Both cultures are gram positive Rhizobium is gram negative and both cultures grow well on nutrient broths and agars which do not favor Rhizobium cultures. Using perlite as the granular carrier, dried mixtures of each of these cultures was prepared. The dried preparations were examined and found to contain 1.2 x 10⁹ viable bacteria per gram for LAlc 2 and 1.9 x 10⁹ viable bacteria per gram for LAlc 6. In each case approximately 5 of the bacteria were revived. It is to be understood that modification of the above described method for making an agriculturally useful bacterial composition and the agricultural product described here is possible within the present invention. For example it may be advantageous to add other constituents to the dried bacterial product of the present invention. Other agricultural products, such as dry or liquid fertilizer or herbicides or pesticides not injurious to the bacteria could be added to the mixture. While it is particularly useful, in addition, to use the dried bacterial composition disclosed here as a seed coating, it could also be applied in furrow, or re wetted and sprayed, or applied in some other fashion.
