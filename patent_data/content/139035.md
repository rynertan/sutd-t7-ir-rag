## Description
TRAVELING BED ION EXCHANGE CONTACT APPARATUS AND PROCESS EMPLOYING SAME The present invention relates to a traveling bed ion exchange or ion concentrating apparatus and to a process employing such an apparatus. Ion exchange or ion concentrating processes are well known in the art and generally employ a fixed bed of an ion exchange or ion concentrating resin which is maintained in a contact or a flow through apparatus or column such that the contacting liquid passes through the apparatus in parallel countercurrent flow to the ion exchange or concentrating resin beads. Each of these processes have one or more disadvantages such as 1 high energy requirements pressure drop due to flow , 2 plugging of the ion exchange bed by particulate material such as, for example, dirt, fine resin and the like, 3 necessity of designing fixed bed units with 50 100 empty volume above the resin for backwashing purposes to remove particulate material from the bed, 4 frequent necessity to perform an ion exchange operation where the flow rates of the different fluids are greatly different causing design and distri bution problems. One or more of these disadvantages have now been overcome by the apparatus and process of the present invention wherein a bed of an ion exchange or ion concentrating resin travels along a plane and the fluid stream to be contacted passes up through the traveling resin bed in a non parallel, substantially perpendicular flow i.e., within about 15 of perpendicular with respect to the planar flow of the resin bed. For purposes of brevity, such ion exchange resins and or material shall be referred to hereinafter as ion exchange resins regardless of what method of exchange, complexing, coordination, absorption, adsorption and or removal and the like actually occurs. Processes for concentrating or removing ions from fluids are well known and usually consist of 1 a resin loading step or stage and 2 a resin regeneration step or stage. Each of the steps or stages can be performed in one process unit or in separate units. Representative of such known processes are described in U.S. Patents 2,671,714 2,772,143 2,814,399 2,897,051 and 3,056,651. The present invention is particularly directed to an improvement in such a process and apparatus in that the contacting fluid is passed through an essentially non filtering traveling bed of an ion exchange or ion concentrating resin in a direction which is substantially perpendicular to the flow of the traveling resin bed.By substantially perpendicular is meant that the angle between the flow of the contacting fluid through the traveling ion exchange resin bed does not exceed about 150 to either side of a line perpendicular to the plane of flow of the traveling ion exchange resin bed. Figure 1 is a cross sectional view along a longitudinal axis of a contactor apparatus containing a traveling bed ion exchange resin. Figure 2 is a cross sectional end view of the contactor apparatus Figure 3 is a cross sectional end view of a contactor apparatus containing a traveling bed ion exchange resin divided by a plurality of baffles. Figure 4 is a top view of the apparatus ofFigure 3 showing the passageways formed by a plurality of the baffles. Figure 5 is a diagramatic view of a system employing several ion exchange contactors connected in a series relationship. Figure 6 is a cross sectional view of a distributing means. Figure 7 is a perspective view of another distributor means. With reference to Figure 1, the traveling bed ion exchange resin apparatus of the invention generally comprises a housing or shell 10, a graded bed which functions as a fluid distributor and which contains successive layers of a coarse gravel 11, a fine gravel 12, and sand 13. An inlet conduit 14, having perforations 17 extend near the bottom of the housing for dispersing a contacting fluid throughout the length of the traveling ion exchange resin bed. The housing is also provided with an ion exchange resin inlet 15 and outlet 16, and a contacting fluid outlet 18. The housing 10 also contains a layer of the ion exchange resin 19 above the layer of sand 13. Figure 2 is a cross sectional end view of the apparatus illustrated in Figure 1 showing the housing 10, the graded bed of the layers of coarse gravel 11 fine gravel 12, and sand 13. Also shown in the end view of Figure 2 is the inlet conduit 14 for the contacting fluid and ion exchange resin 19. Figure 3 is a cross sectional end view of a traveling bed ion exchange resin apparatus containing one or more baffles to form a flow path for the resin of greater length in a relatively more compact area.Instead of a single fluid inlet conduit 14 as shown in the apparatus of Figures 1 and 2, each of the bed sections formed by the subdividing baffles is provided with a separate fluid inlet conduit 14. A single ion exchange resin inlet 15 and outlet 16 and a single contacting fluid outlet 18 is provided in the housing. Figure 4 is a top view of the apparatus ofFigure 3 showing the interleafing baffles and fluid inlet conduit in the housing 10 and the single ion exchange resin inlet 15 and outlet 16. In the apparatus illustrated in Figures 3 and 4, the baffles 29, define compartments in the housing 10 which are open at one end and which contain the traveling ion exchange resin bed such that the flow is lengthwise from one compartment to the other. Within each compartment, the traveling bed of ion exchange resin is contacted with fresh liquid from inlet conduits 14 which are connected to a common header 21. In some instances, it may be desirable to employ counter current staging wherein the contacting liquid overflow from the last resin stage is collected and employed as the feed for a preceeding stage. Such could be employed to achieve a higher overall efficiency and one such means for accomplishing this is illustrated in Figure 5 in which a plurality of traveling bed ion exchange resin contactors such as are illustrated in Figures 1 4 are employed. The individual contractors are designated as TBC 1, TBC 2, TBC N and are connected in series employing counter current flow of the contacting fluid with respect to the traveling ion exchange resin bed in that the fresh contacting fluids fed to the traveling bed ion exchange resin contactor which is last in the series with respect to the feed of fresh ion exchange resin contactor etc.Fresh ion exchange resin, designated FIR, is fed to the first traveling bed ion exchange resin contactor TBC 1 and subsequently into the subsequent contactors TBC 2 through TBC N. The Spent Contacting Fluid, SCF, is discharged from the contactor which is first in the series TBC 1. Likewise, the loaded ion exchange resin,LIR, is discharged from the contactor which is last in the series, TBC N. Figure 6 is a cross sectional view of an alternate means for distributing the contacting fluid.This distributor would replace the graded bed distributing means illustrated in Figures 1, 2 and 3. As can readily be seen in Figure 6, this distributor 22, is constructed of a plurality of channel members 23 which are maintained, by a means not shown, in a spaced apart relationship. The treating fluid after entering the contactor apparatus via, preferably, a perforated conduit, not shown, passes through the distributor 22, as illustrated by the arrows 24. The space d in each instance being adjustable, by means not illustrated, so as to control flow and pressure drop through the distributor 22. The distributor 6 is arranged in an ion exchange resin contactor such that the ion exchange resin would preferably travel in a direction perpendicular to the length of the channels 23, as shown by the large two headed arrow 25. Figure 7 is a sectional view of another distributor which is composed of at least two spaced apart corrugated sheets of material, 10 and 11, each sheet being.provided with a multiplicity of holes perforations 12 and 13 respectively, said sheets being aligned with respect to the holes perforations in each sheet in a manner to produce a tortuous path for the liquid flowing therethrough, so as to prevent linear flow of liquid through adjacent sheets. If desired the distributor can be constructed of 3, 4 or more perforated sheets. The material of construction of the sheets is not critical so long as it is essentially non reactive or non corrosive when in contact with the treating components or the components being treated. In the contactors of the present invention, the graded bed distributor and or support can be prepared from materials other than gravel and sand so long as the material is inert to the ion exchange resin and the contacting liquid. Suitable materials include ceramic or plastic tower packing materials such as Berl saddles, Raschig and Lessing rings, and the like. The purpose of the graded bed or other distributor is to uniformly distribute the incoming contacting fluid and to create a support upon which the ion exchange resin can move. The graded bed can be employed in combination with other distributing means and also a single grade of particulate matter can be employed in combination with other distributing means. Other methods for uniformly distributing the contacting fluid over the area of the traveling ion exchange resin bed are disclosed in Chemical Engineers Handbook, Fifth Edition, McGraw Hill, 1973, pp. 5 47 to pp. 5 55, including, as distributors, perforated pipes, tube banks, and as distributor and or support, perforated plates and screens, as well as combinations thereof and the like. Irrespective ofthe particular distribution means, it is so constructed that during operation it does not substantially filter out any suspended solid filterable material which may be contained in the liquid being treated. Accordingly, the process and apparatus of the present invention is particularly useful when the contacting liquid contains suspended matter having a particle size of about 0.01 inch 0.0254 cm. , particularly about 0.008 inch 0.02032 cm. . The process and apparatus of the present invention is suitable for any ion exchange or ion concentrating process either anionic or cationic or neutral such as for example, water softening, partial demineralizing, uranium recovery from ores, recovery of copper and other soluble metals from water, sugar purification, brine purification, acid recovery, recovery of MgC1, from seawater, and the like. The ion exchange resins can be either anionic or cationic depending upon the ion desired to be removed from the contacting fluid. In addition to the traditional ion exchange resins wherein an ion from the ion exchange resin is replaced with an ion from the liquid being treated, other particulate resins and substances may be employed in the process and apparatus herein described such as, for example complexing, zeolites, chelating, sequestering, coordination, absorption, and or adsorption materials which can be either anionic, cationic or neutral and which remove ions or molecules without replacement of the ions. In those instances where it is desired to increase the quantity of fluid being treated but the velocity is such that the height of the taveling resin bed is at a maximum with respect to the dimensions of the contactor apparatus, the weight of the ion exchange resin can be increased according to the procedure described in copending application serial no. 307,829 filed October 2, 1981. The following examples are illustrative of the invention but are not to be construed as to limiting the scope thereof in any manner.EXAMPLE 1 An apparatus similar to that of Figures 1 and 2 was employed in which the housing had a dimension of approximately 2 x 16 x 4 0.61 m x 4.88 m x 1.22 m .The housing contained a graded bed of 6 inches 15.24 cm of coarse gravel, 3 inches 7.62 cm of fine gravel and 3 inches 7.62 cm of sand. Seawater was passed through a perforated 3 inch 7.62 cm 0.D. pipe at a rate of 100 gallons per minute 6.309 l s . Through the resin inlet was fed a mixture of 60 volume percentDOWEX 50 X8 50 100 mesh ion exchange resin in a feed liquor of river water and ion exchange resin containing 0.15 meq. ml calcium ions, 1.7 meq. ml sodium ions and 0.1 meq. ml magnesium ions. The seawater containing 75 salinity and 950 ppm magnesium ions and was passed up through the graded bed and through the traveling bed of ion exchange resin in a direction essentially perpendicular to the flow of the ion exchange resin resulting in an ion exchange fluidized bed height of about 20 inches 50.8 cm . The contacted seawater was removed from the milliequivalents parts per million apparatus through an outlet which was positioned at a distance of approximately 2 feet 0.61 m above the top of the traveling ion exchange bed. The seawater containing about 500 ppm magnesium ions was then removed from the overflow. The average resin velocity was about 0.8 ft min 0.004 m s and the average seawater velocity was about 0.6 ft min 0.003 m s . The volume ratio of seawater to ion exchange resin was about 15 1.The ion exchange resin was removed from the opposite end of its feed inlet and was at a concentration of about 60 percent by volume in seawater river water and contained 0.77 meg. of Mg ml of resin. The ion exchange resin was then separated from the seawater river water in a settling tank and regenerated with NaC1. The regeneration process employing NaCl to strip MgCl2 from the loaded resin can be performed by known methods so as to produce a MgCl2 solution in water. Such a MgCl2 solution can be partially dehydrated and fed to an electrolytic magnesium cell for the production and recovery of magnesium metal and chlorine. The spent seawater was then discharged as a waste stream. Such a stream can be employed to carry the ion exchange resin instead of the river water employed above.EXAMPLE 2 A 2 ft. 0.61 m wide x 125 ft. 38.1 m long traveling bed ion exchange contactor employing a 12 inch 30.48 cm settled resin depth of DOWEX 50, 50 100 mesh ion exchange resin was employed to treat a river water stream containing a hardness of 200 ppm as CaCO3 at a rate of 850 gpms. The thus treated water had a hardness as CaCO3 of only 10 ppm. EXAMPLE 3 A Present Invention Data were collected on a 2 ft. 0.61 m wide by 125 ft. 38.1 m long traveling bed contactor using an 8 inch 20.32 cm settled depth of DOWEX 50, 50 100 mesh ion exchange resin having an equilibrium loading value of 0.82 milliequivalents meq. of Mg per ml.After passing 16 bed volumes of 75 salinity sea water through the contactor, the resin had a loading of 0.74 meg. Mg ml which was an efficiency of 90 . B Comparative Experiment A single stage hydroclone resin seawater contactor employing essentially the same ion exchange resin was operated and required 30 bed volumes of 75 salinity seawater to achieve the same resin loading. The above clearly demonstrates the improved efficiency of the traveling bed ion exchange contactor and process employing same over a single stage ion exchange contactor not of the traveling bed type in that less seawater need be contacted to achieve the same resin loading value when employing the contactor and process of the present invention.EXAMPLE 4 A traveling bed ion exchange apparatus was constructed of 1 4 0.635 cm plexiglass panels. The inside length and width were 18 inches 45.72 cm and 6 inches 15.24 cm , respectively. The height was 15 Bed volume is a dimensionless measure of the volume of the contacting fluid based on the settled volume of the resin VB VV resqund V resin inches 38.1 cm . Attached to the front wall and running parallel to, and three inches 7.62 cm from each side wall, was an internal path separation wall 8 inches 20.32 cm high. It extended only 15 inches 38.1 cm down the length of the bed. This left a 3 inch 7.62 cm space in which the traveling resin could turn 1800 and move toward the front wall. A 5 inch 12.7 cm high weir wall was attached perpendicularly to, and running between, the path separation wall and the right wall. The weir wall was 3 1 4 8.255 cm from the front wall blocking the right path of the bed. This positioning created a 3 1 4 x 3 8.255 cm x 7.62 cm resin collector, at the end of the traveling bed path. An effluent trough was attached to the left wall and was supported by the front and back walls of the traveling bed. The trough was two inches 5.08 cm wide and one inch 2.54 cm deep. It extended through the front wall for a distance of eleven inches 27.94 cm . There were three one eighth inch 0.31 75 cm holes drilled in the center of the trough at four, eight, and twelve inches 10.16, 20.32 and 30.48 cm from the back wall. A drip lip extended downward, at the front end of the trough, for one and one quarter inches 3.175 cm . The feed input apparatus consisted of a 3 8 0.9525 cm stainless steel tubes blocked off at the back end. In each tube there were thirty four three thirty seconds inch 0.238125 cm holes drilled one inch 2.54 cm apart. The holes were in two columns, 900 degrees apart and one column began and ended one half inch 1.27 cm ahead of the other. The tubes extended 17 inches 43.18 cm into the bed from the front wall and were positioned one inch 2.54 cm above the bottom.The tubes were connected by elbows and T s outside the front wall of the traveling bed so that feed coming in would flow into the bed in even distribution throughout the length Of the bed. A ne half inch 1.27 cm plastic tube connected the stainless steel flow distributors to a pump adjusted by a ball valve to flow at three gallons per minute per square foot 2.04 liters per second per square meter .From the pump to the feed reservoir, there ran another one ha.1.f inch 1.27 cm tube. The feed reservoir consisted of a plaC .ic fifty five gallon 208 1 drum with two hundz ed liters of feed. In the center of the bottom of the resin collector defined hy the weir wall the front wall, the right wall, anct the path separation wall there was a hole drilled and t hreaded to accommodate a three eights inch 0.9525 cm tuning elbow. The elbow was screwed into the bottom panel and attached on the outside to a one half inch l.i 7 cm valve. From the ball valve there extended a one half inch 1.27 cm I.D. black rubber hose, it attached to a Gorman Rupp Model 12500 13 vibrat ing pump. Another one half inch 1.27 cm hose e tend .d from tlle piimp discharge to a bucket.The resin collector, tubing elbow, valve, hose, pump, and bucket made up tulle resin removal system for the traveling bed. The resin in pllt system consisted of a six and one half inch, 16.51 funnel with a three inch 7.62 cm extention of rubber hose on the bottom. It was positioned so that resin would be fed into the front end of the bed in the left path and two inches 5.08 cm from the front wall. Before the experiment was run, four and one half inches 11.43 cm of a cleaned coarse sand, ranging in particle size from 8 to 50 mesh U.S. Standard, was placed in th bed as an additional flow distributor.The Feed The feed for the traveling beS experiment was made up to be 30 ppm Cu . To mke 200 liters of feed, 23.6 g CuSO45H2O was added to 200 liters of DIH2O. In addition, 2.85 g FeCl2.4H2O was added to the feed to give an iron contort of 4 ppm FeThe Resin A chelating picolylamine resin XF3 43084 available from The Dow Chemical Company was used for this experiment. Total quantity used was 1200 cc resin.The Experiment The feed solution of 3 2 ppm Cu was upflowed into the traveling bed at 3 gpm ft2. Temperature of feed 310C, pH of feed 2.75. The feed was allowed to enter the system until it overflowed through the effluent trough. At that time, a stop watch was started.Resin was added to the system at a rate of 1C 0 cc resin per minute. At the end of each minute, a 20 cc plastic syringe with a rubber tube attached was extended into the bed at the center of the turnaround point. Two samples of effluent were drawn about one inch 2.54 cm above the resin and or sand. A total of seventeen samples were taken in this manner. A feed sample was also taken from the feed reservoir and effluent samples 3 from the effluent trough were taken at 5, 11, and 17 minutes intervals into the run. The resin put into the system flowed down the left path of the bed to the back wall, turned around the path separation wall, and moved back to the front of the bed. It moved to the weir wall, and as excess resin was added through the funnel, resin at the weir wall was pushed into the resin collector and pumped into a bucket. At the end of the sampling of Sample 17, the feed pump was turned off. The Results The samples from this experiment were analyzed on a Perkin Elmer Model 2380 atomic absorption spectrometer. The results were as follows Sample Bed Volume Effluent ppm Cu Feed 0 32 1 14.1 20 2 28.14 19 3 42.3 18.7 4 56.3 18 5 70.5 18 6 84.6 18.5 7 98.7 18 8 112.8 17.8 9 126.9 18 10 141.1 18.6 11 155.2 19.6 12 169.3 19 13 183.4 18.5 14 197.5 18.7 15 211.6 20 16 225.7 21.5 17 240.1 21.5 It should be noted that Sample 1 was taken before the resin reached the turn around where the sampling was done. Therefore, it is safe to say that the sand itself had some attraction for the copper ion.The numbers also show that when the resin had passed the sampling point at between Sample 2 and Sample 3 a drop of 2 ppm was observed.
