# Circuit arrangement for converting an analog AC voltage signal to a digital signal.

## Abstract
The invention lies in the field of converting analog AC signals to digital signals which then, for example, are transmitted by use of the pulse code modulation method. The circuit arrangement contains sampling means S1 which cyclically sample the analog AC signal and form analog sampling values, and an analog digital converter A, STS, DAU, KOM for converting the analog sampling values to digital sampling values. Further the circuit arrangement contains a sign integrator VZ, HZ which integrates the sign of the digital sampling values, a compensating voltage generator DAU , which generates a compensating voltage in dependence upon the integration result and a combination circuit KOM , which combines the compensating voltage with the analog sampling value from the sampling means and applies the combination result to the analog digital converter. The circuit arrangement permits compensation of a DC voltage component contained in the analog AC signal so that interferences are avoided which are the result of such a DC voltage component.
