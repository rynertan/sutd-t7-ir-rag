# No lash telescoping steering shaft.

## Abstract
A no lash telescoping steering shaft 10 comprises first and second telescopically arranged parts 12, 18 which are confi gured to transmit torque therebetween. The first and second parts carry an axially and radially movable locking piece 68 engaging the first and second parts at points which are axially spaced apart. The locking piece is coupled for axial movement with the inner of the two parts and frictionally engages the outer part to prevent relative axial movement thereof. Because the locking piece engages the first and second parts at axially spaced points, it creates a moment therebetween. The moment opposes side to side relative movement of the two parts in a first axial plane. The moment also urges cooperating surfaces 86, 88 of the two parts into engagement. The cooperating surfaces resist side to side relative movement of the two parts in a second axial plane which is substantially perpendicular to the first plane and also eliminate rotational lash from the steering shaft.
