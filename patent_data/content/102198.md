# APPARATUS AND METHOD OF MATERIAL REMOVAL WITH FLUID FLOW WITHIN A SLOT

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for cleaning material at the outer edge 200 of an object 158 by applying a fluid, which can be a solvent, for the material to a flat surface 198 adjacent the edge 200 by contact and moving the solvent onto the edge 200 by centrifugal force. A slot 160 is provided in a planar surface 162 . The slot 160 is arcuate and elongated. The fluid 193 is directed along the slot 160 in the direction of rotation by a baffle 182 . The slot 160 has a botton 171 sloping upward toward the planar surface 162 in the direction of rotation. A notch is provided between an edge of the planar surface 162 and the slot 160 to act as a spillway for excess solvent.
