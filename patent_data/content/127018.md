# Measuring barometric pressure with a manifold pressure sensor in a microprocessor based engine control system.

## Abstract
A method of measuring barometric pressure with a man ifold pressure sensor 62 in a microprocessor based engine control system utilizes known engine operating conditions to interrogate the sensor. Also on engine turn off, a power latch signal 158 is generated to delay power removal until the throttle valve 160 is driven open and the pressure sensor 62 is interrogated for its value. This value at this time is the ambient or barometric value of pressure. This value is stored in the microprocessor s 26, 28 memory 84, 86 and main tained by means of a standby voltage 80 . During engine operation, the pressure sensor 62 is interrogated and value of the stored barometric pressure is changed by one unit of pressure if the stored and measured values are unequal.
