SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with this invention, a met od has been found for making copolymer salts from low molecular weight copolymer acids formed from ethylene and an alpha,beta ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid having at least one carboxylic acid group, and the metal cations of Group II metal oxides.

The objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent by reference to the following specification DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention is a process for producing copolymer salts from low molecular weight copolymer acids. The copolymer acids are made from ethylene and an alpha,beta ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid having at least one carboxylic acid group. In the process, the carboxylic acid groups of the copolymer are neutralized by the metal cations of the oxides of metals from Group II of the Periodic Table of Elements. The copolymer acid and the metal oxide are fed to a reaction vessel. The reactants are mixed at a temperature above the melting point of the copolymer acid, but below the temperature at which the reaction is occurring.The reactants are mixed until the metal oxides are homogene ously dispersed in the copolymer acid matrix. The reaction is initiated by increasiny the temperature to at least a temperature where the reaction occurs. During the reaction, the reacting mass is continually mixed within the reacting vessel. Additionally, the temperature within the reaction vessel is controlled and maintained above the polymer melting point. The reaction can proceed until no volatiles are observed or measured coming from the reacting mass. It is recognized that although the process description and examples to follow are directed to a batch type process, the process of the present invention is adaptable to a continuous process.The copolymer acid and metal oxide are mixed at a temperature above the melting point of the copolymer but at a low enough temperature so that the copolymer acid and salt do not significantly react. The mixing temperature is between the melting point of the copolymer acid and 200C, preferably 100C above the melting point of the copolymer acid. In this temperature range any reaction between the metal oxide and the copolymer acid is very slow. Therefore, a uniform mixture of the copolymer acid and metal salt can occur before reaction. This results in a more homogeneous copolymer salt when the reaction does take place. Additionally, it is desirable to mix the metal oxide with the copolymer acid at as low a temperature above the melting point of the salt as possible. The copolymer acid is more viscous at a lower temperature. The more viscous copolymer results in more shear during mixing and a more uniform mix. The mixing of the copolymer acid and the metal oxide in the temperature range between the melting temperature of the copolymer acid and 200C, preferably 100C above the melt temperature, allows a uniform mixture before the reaction takes place. This allows the reaction to occur at a lower temperature for shorter lengths of time. The time the mixture is maintained between the melting point of the copolymer acid and 200C above the melting point of the copolymer acid can be considered an induction time. That is, all the time during which the reactants are brought together and the reaction rate is very slow. Eventually the reaction will take place and speed up. The addition of water accelerates the reaction. Water can be added to shorten the induction time or lower the reaction temperature. Water is a reaction product formed during the formation of the copolymer salt. Water so produced will accelerate the reaction. Upon completion of the mixing step the reaction can be conducted. This can occur by adding an initiatiny material, such as water, to initiate the reaction or more preferably, by raising the temperature. The temperature within the reaction vessel is controlled to assure volatilization of the volatilizable reaction products as they are produced. The predominant volatile is water produced on neutralization of the copolymer acid. The temperature is maintained above the reaction temperature. This is the temperature at which the reaction is conducted. It is at least 200C above tne melting temperature of the copolymer acid.Preferably, the reaction temperature is maintained at a temperature from 1300C to 3000C, more preferably from 1300C to 2600C, yet more preferably from about 1400C to about 2200C, and most preferably from 1400 to 1600C. It has been found that the volatiles of the preferred copolymer salts are removed resulting in a uniform copolymer salt free of volatiles when heated to above a lower limit, preferably 1500C. The upper limit on temperature is preferably below 2200C. The reaction temperature should be as low as possible so that the copolymer salts do not experience deleterious effects of heat, such as discoloration, particularly when oxygen is present.However, the temperature must be high enough to allow the copolymer salt to have a low enough viscosity so that it can be mixed, and removed from the reactor, and so that volatiles can be removed. To assure a uniform product, the copolymer salt and metal oxide are mixed in the vessel for a sufficient time to form a homoyeneous mixture. The reaction can proceed for as long as necessary to be complete. To assure a uniform product free from volatiles, it is preferred that the reaction proceed for at least one half hour. Preferably, the reaction should proceed from onehalf hour to five hours, and more preferably from onehalf hour to four hours. Preferably the mixing and reaction steps are conducted under a nitrogen blanket at atmospheric pressure. A preferred pressure range is from 0.8 atmospheres to five atmospheres 81 x 103 to 507 x 103 Pa and more preferably one atmosphere to two atmospheres 101 x 103 to 203 x 103 Pa . The nitrogen atmosphere prevents oxidation and discoloration of the copolymer salt.Copolymer salts produced in the presence of oxygen and at least atmospheric pressure were yellow in appearance and contained many gels. At the end of the reaction, the volatiles can be vacuum stripped from the reaction. In the process of the present invention the low molecular weight of the copolymer acid makes it convenient to neutralize the copolymer acid in a reaction vessel, either batchwise or continuous. The molecular weights of the copolymer acids are so low that the viscosity is too low for processing in the manner described in the referenced prior art patents, i.e. extruders and on mills. Therefore, the present invention provides a method to easily neutralize low molecular weight copolymer acids to form corresponding copolymer salts which are color stable, and uniform in appearance. In an alternate embodiment of the present invention the copolymer acid and metal oxide are mixed at a temperature above the melting point of the copolymer but at a low enough temperature so that the copolymer acid and salt do not significantly react. The mixing temperature is between the melting point of the copolymer acid and 200C, preferably 100C above the melting point of the copolymer acid. Preferably, the copolymer acid is melted prior to adding the metal oxide. The copolymer acid and the metal oxide are mixed until the metal oxide is uniformly dispersed in the copolymer acid. The mixture is substantially non reacted. The mixture can then be cooled to room temperature. The cooled mixture can be heated to a reaction temperature at a later time.Preferably the cooled mixture is ground to a powder or pelletized. This embodiment is particularly useful in making mixtures of copolymer acids and metal oxides which can be mixed as a premix or masterbatch with additional copolymer acid. The premix can contain a copolymer acid and up to 65 percent, preferably from one percent to 65 percent, and more preferably from 10 to 30 percent by weight of the mixture. The alpha,beta ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids can be copolymerized with ethylene preferably having 3 to 8 carbon atoms. Examples of such acids include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, ethacrylic acid, itaconic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid and monoesters of other dicarboxylic acids such as methyl hydrogen maleate, methyl hydrogen fumarate, ethyl hydrogen fumarate, and maleic anhydride which is considered to behave like an acid and be an acid in the present invention. The concentration of the etnylene in the copolymer is at least 75 mol percent, and more preferably 80 to 95 mol percent. A preferred alpha,beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid is acrylic acid. The ethylene acrylic acid copolymer has an acid number in the range from 1 to 180, with an acid number from 40 to 160 being preferred, and an acid number from 40 to 120 being most preferred. The acid number is determined by the number of milligrams of potassium hydroxide to neutralize one gram of acid. The number average molecular weight of the copolymer acid is from 500 to 20,000, preferably from 1,000 to 15,000, more preferably from 1,000 to 6,000, and most preferably from 1,000 to 3,500, as measured by size exclusion chromatography. The low molecular weight copolymer acids used to make the copolymer salts of the present invention can be prepared by any suitable process known in the art.Typical copolymer acids and an example method is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,658,741, which is incorporated herein by reference. Although various alpha,beta ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymers may be used, as noted above, it is preferred to use ethylene acrylic acid copolymers. Table I below characterizes three preferred ethylene acrylic copolymers which can be used in this process. These acids have number average molecular weights in the range of from 1,000 to 3,500.

Metal cations which are preferred are maynesium, calcium, barium and zinc, with calcium cations being most preferred. The copolymer acid can be neutralized up to 100 percent however, it is preferred to neutralize from 15 to 60 percent and more preferably from 25 to 50 percent neutralization of the carboxylic acid groups of the copolymer acid using the process of the present invention. There can be more metal oxide than needed to attain 100 percent neutralization of the copolymer acid. This is preferably the case when making premixes of the copolymer acid and metal oxides. The temperature at which the copolymer acid ofTable I and metal oxides are mixed should be no greater than 200C above the melting point of the copolymer acids. The reaction temperature is at least 200C above the listed melting points to assure the removal of all volatiles and allow the continual mixing and handling of the reaction product of the copolymer salt. of course, the temperature can be optimized or varied depending on the particular copolymer salt being produced. When the ionic crosslinking takes place, the viscosity of the reaction product increases with the neutralization level. By mixing the metal oxide and copolymer acid at a temperature between the melting point of the copolymer acid and 200C above the melting point of the copolymer acid, the metal oxide is homogeneously and completely dispersed. This results in complete reaction between the metal oxide and the carboxyl groups. The products are substantially free from undissolved particles of metal oxide. The resulting copolymer salt can be produced at lower processing temperatures and in less mixing time at the reaction temperature. Copolymer acid salts produced by the method of the present invention are cream white in appearance and have few gel type impurities and no particles of undissolved base. The copolymer salts are uniform in appearance and have good color stability. The mixing was good and all volatiles were released and removed leaving a very smooth and well dispersed material. Following are several examples which illustrate the nature of the invention and a manner of carryiny it out. Although the followiny examples are conducted in a batch type laboratory setup, it is appreciated that the method of the present invention can be conducted continuously. The invention should not be limited to the details of these examples. EXAMPLES 1 11 Examples 1 11 were conducted in a 5 liter round bottom flask equipped with a 4N 10.2 cm turbine agitator driven by an electric motor, condenser thermocouple, and provision for purging with nitrogen and stripping under vacuum. Heating was accomplished with an electric heating mantle. Twenty five hundred grams of copolymer acid B ofTable I was added to the flask. The copolymer acid was heated with agitation at a temperature Tm to melt it under a nitrogen atmosphere of about one atmosphere.Over a ten minute period 43.25 grams of calcium oxide powder 1.73 if 100 pure was added with continued stirring to disperse the calcium oxide powder. The calcium oxide was obtained from the Mississippi LimeComany. It was about 98 pure and 325 mesh. The mixture was kept at Tm until a reaction apparently was beginning as indicated by viscosity increase and bubble formation. This time was the induction time. The temperature was then raised to a reaction temperature Tr . This is the temperature at which the copolymer acid and the metal salt reacted to form the copolymer salt. This temperature is dependent on the moisture present. The Tr is characterized by the generation of heat and water vapor bubbles being released.The heating was continued until a temperature of 1500C was reached where the reaction continued. The temperature was maintained at 1500C for 45 minutes and then a vacuum at 25 inches of mercury 84 x 103 Pa was applied for fifteen minutes. The molten product was discharged. In Examples 1 4 a nitrogen purye was used to assure removal of moisture. In Examples 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 11 the indicated weight percent of water was added to the reactor. In Comparative 3 the Tm and Tr were both 1600C. In Comparatives 4 and 5 calcium hydroxide was used in place of calcium oxide. The induction time at various This are shown on Table II. The melting point of copolymer B is 1020C.

A review of Table II shows that as little as 0.05 percent water present lowers the induction time at Tm, which is the time at Tm before a reaction is apparent.When there is 0.1 percent vater, the induction time is reduced considerably. The nitrogen purge has some effect on induction time. Comparatives 1 3 show that increased heating to 200C above the melt temperature reduces the induction time. Comparatives 4 and 5 show that calcium hydroxide resuts in an immediate reaction. The importance of induction time is indicated in Examples 1 and 4 and Comptratives 1 5, which all had short or no induction time aid had considerable amounts of undispersed calcium oxide r calcium hydroxide. EXAMPLE 12 A premix was made by melting 30.0 grams of copolymer acid B from Table 1 in a 150 ml beaker heated to 1200C. Upon melting copolymer acid B 10.0 grams of calcium oxide of the type used in Example 1 was stirred in with a thermometer for ten minutes. The mixture was poured onto aluminum foil, cooled to room temperature and cut into strips. After 72 hours, 51 days, and 143 days samples of the mixture were remelted at 1200C. No apparent reaction had taken place in any of the samples. Therefore, a stable highly concentrated metal oxide in copolymer premix can be made. This premix is a useful and convenient way of adding a predispersed metal oxide to larger amounts of copolymer acids to obtain uniform dispersions in shorter mixing times and using less energy to disperse the metal oxide in the copolymer acid. EXAMPLE 13 A premix was made by melting 50.0 grams of copolymer B from Table 1 in a beaker heated to between 1100C and 1200C. Upon melting copolymer acid B, 86.3 grams of calcium oxide was slowly added over a 20 minute period and stirred until the calcium oxide was uniformly dispersed in the polymer acid. There was no apparent reaction. While exemplary embodiments of the invention have been described, the true scope of the invention is to be determined from the followiny claims.
