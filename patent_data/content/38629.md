## Description
VIRAZOLE DERIVATIVES, PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION AND THEIR USE AS ANTIVIRAL AGENTS This invention relates to virazole derivatives, a process for their preparation and their use as antiviral agents. l ss Ribofuranosyl 1,2,4 triazole 3 carboxamide hereinafter referred to as virazole is a known antiviral agent see, for example, British Patent Specification No.1,353,565 and Streeter et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 70, 1174 1973 . Virazole 5 alkyl esters are also known to share this activity as is virazole 2 ,3 ,5 triacetate and virazole phosphates see, for example, Sidwell et al.,J. Med. Chem., 21, 742 1978 . It is also known that certain lipophilic amines such as cyclooctylamine, 1aminoadamantane, l adamant l yl l aminoethane and spiroamantadine possess antiviral activity. It has also been reported that mixtures of virazole and l adamant l yl laminoethane display good in vitro activity against influenza virus see, for example, Galegov et al., Experientia, 33, 905, 1977 . One disadvantage with virazole is that it is a metabolic inhibitor which inhibits weight gain in animals. It would clearly be desirable to find antiviral agents which do not suffer from this disadvantage.Such a class of agents has now been discovered. According to the present invention there is provided a compound of the formula I EMI2.1 or a salt thereof, wherein X is a hydrogen atom or aHO2C CH2 nCO group, and n is 2 or 3. Preferred compounds according to the invention are amine salts of formula II EMI2.2 wherein R1 is a group such that R1NH2 is an antiviral lipophilic amine, and n is as defined in formula I . Suitable antiviral lipophilic amines are alkyl primary amines containing from 8 to 14 carbon atoms and at least one ring. Such amines include amantadine, rimantadine, spiroamantadine and cyclooctylamine. The preferred antiviral lipophilic amine is amantadine. Other suitable salts of the compounds of formula I are alkali or alkaline earth metal salts or salts with anion exchange resins. In order to use the compounds of the invention as antiviral agents they are formulated in pharmaceutical compositions for human or veterinary use by standard methods in several dosage forms. Accordingly, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula I , or a salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Compounds which are active when given by the oral route may be compounded in the form of syrups, tablets and capsules. When the composition is in the form of a tablet, any pharmaceutical carrier suitable for formulating such solid compositions may be used, for example magnesium stearate, starch, lactose, glucose, rice, flour and chalk.The composition may also be in the form of an ingestible capsule, for example of gelatin, to contain the compound, or in the form of a syrup, a solution or a suspension.Suitable liquid pharmaceutical carriers include ethyl alcohol, glycerine, saline and water to which flavouring or colouring agents may be added to form syrups. The salts may also be presented with a sterile liquid carrier for injection. In man, influenza virus typically infects the upper respiratory tract and may be effectively treated by topical application of, for example, nose drops. Alternatively, the compositions of this invention may be presented as a microfine powder for insufflation in such a case the particles of active compound suitably have diameters of less than 50 microns, preferably less than 10 microns or in the form of an aerosol or a solution for a nebuliser. Preferably the compositions of this invention are in unit dosage form or in some other form that the patient may administer to himself a single dose. A suitable dosage unit might contain from 1 to 250 mg of active ingredient, for example 2 to 100 mg. Such doses may be administered 1 to 6 times a day or more usually 3 to 4 times a day. The effective dose of salt depends on the particular salt employed, but is in general in the range of from 0.1 mg kg day to 20 mg kg of body weight per day or more usually 0.5 mg kg day to 10 mg kg day. The compounds of formula I in which X is a hydrogen atom may be prepared by treating virazole with a tritylating agent followed by a carbonating agent and subsequently removing the trityl group. A preferred tritylating agent is trityl chloride and a preferred carbonating agent is 1, l carbonyl diimidazole. The salts of the formula II may be prepared by reacting the chosen amine RÃšNH2 with a compound of the formula III EMI5.1 Accordingly in a further aspect the invention provides a process for preparing a salt of the formula II as hereinbefore defined which process comprises 1 1 reacting an amine R NH2 where R is as hereinbefore defined with a compound of the formula III as here inbefore defined. The reaction is conveniently carried out by mixing a solution of the amine with a solution of the compound of the formula III and thereafter where desired removing the solvent. The reaction is best carried out at moderate temperatures. The precise temperature is not critical, but should be selected so that the reagents at least are not deposited from solution. We have found room temperature to be convenient. Suitable solvents for the above process may be determined by trial and error. Generally, the solvents are polar organic solvents such as lower alkanols or aqueous mixures thereof or water adjusted where necessary to pH at which the reagents are soluble. A preferred solvent is methanol optionally together with water. The compounds of formula III may themselves be prepared by treating a compound of formula I in which x is a hydrogen atom with an acid anhydride of formula EMI6.1 in which n is 2 or 3. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as 4 dimethylaminopyridine, in a polar solvent, such as pyridine. The compounds of the formulae I , II and III may be prepared as shown in the following scheme EMI6.2 The esterification of 1 ss D 2 , 3 carbonyl ribofuranosyl 3 carbamoyl 1,2,4 triazole may be effected by the reaction with succinic anhydride in the presence of an acid acceptor such as 4 dimethylaminopyridine in a solvent such as pyridine. Such reactions are normally carried out at an elevated temperature such as 100 C. Evaporation of the solvent yields the initial crude product which may then be purified in conventional manner such as by chromatography. The acid ester may be neutralised in conventional manner to provide salts if these are required. The virazole carbonate may be prepared as described in the Examples. The following Examples illustrate the invention Example 1 1 ss D 5 Trityl ribofuranosyl 3 carbamoyl 1,2,4 triazole 2 A solution of l 8 D ribofuranosyl 3 carbamoyl 1,2,4 triazole 1 10 g, 0.041 mol and trityl chloride 12,4 g, 0.045 mol in pyridine 120 ml was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours and then heated on a steam bath for 0.5 hour.

The antiviral activity of a compound can be assessed from its ability to inhibit these influenza induced effects.Procedure. Groups of 10 male Charles River mice of the outbred CD 1 strain were used. The mice weighed about 20g at the start of the experiment and group weights were matched.Infection was by aerosol. Primary stocks of a mouse adapted strain of the A2 HK 1 68 virus were passaged in eggs to provide a working stock which was stored at 700C. Working dilutions were made in 1 1 nutrient broth phosphate buffered saline. Virus was nebulized in an airflow of 25 1 mien. into a chamber of volume 120 litres. Compounds were administered twice daily for 3 days, the first dose being given 3 hours before infection and the second 3 hours after infection. Infection was with 1 30 LD50 of virus administered over 15 minutes. Body weight changes were recorded over the dosing period and used as an indication of drug toxicity.On day 8 post infection the animals were killed with an intraperitoneal injection of barbiturate, the body weights recorded, and then the lungs carefully excisted and weighed. Results were analysed by a method of least significant differences. ResultsEMI16.1 tb SEP Weight SEP Change SEP Day SEP 8 SEP Means SEP tb exit.
