## Description
IMPROVEMDNTS RELATING TO THD UNDERGROUND GASIFICATION OF COAL This invention relates to the underground gas ification of coal and particularly to a method oE gasifying coal which improves the efficiency and yield of the gasifying operation. Gasification is a method of partially burning coal underground under conditions such as to generate combustible gas usually a mixture of CO, 112, CH4 COS and N2 . Proposals for the underground gasification of coal seams which, for one renson or another, are unable to be mined economically by conventional methods, are not new, and much work has been carried out on the idea particularly in the U.S.S.R., but also in other countries. In general the problems encountered hitherto, coupled with the ready availability and low cost of petroleum products until recently, have hindered the development of fully commercial operations for underground gasification. With the rapid escalation in the cost of petroleum, interest bas beer. restimulated in the exploitaticn of coal seams by ga ificntion. Convertional meth ds of gasifying conl seams have involved the drilling or pa rs of bereholes, either v tically or at a stesp e, into the seam, linking these holes by a chan l f ed in the seam and pasaing borehole and recovering combustiblc gas from the other borehole. the operation is illustrated schematically in Figure 1 and the scenario comprises essntially burning face or combustion zone, and a gasification or reouction zone. In the coml ustion zone, carbon and some of the tar and volatile hydrocarbons in the coal are burned to produce a high temperature gas stream containing carbon dioxide and water vapour.These react. in the gasification zone with hot coke., both as broken material which has fallen from the coal face and the walls of the gas exit channel, and the surfaces of the exit channel. The raw coal behind the burning face is heated by conduction from the face water vapour, tars and rich gas are discnarged through the hot surfaces by which they may be partly cracked to hydrogen and carbon monoxide before mixing with the reacting gas stream. The combustion and gasification zoiies move forward into the virgin coal, mining the coal. It has been found necessary to drill the boreholes at quite closely spaced intervals, which is costly Moreover, such drilling arrangements can only be made on relatively flat terrain. As a means of mitigating the above problems,.boreholes have been drilled along the lower part of a seam, linked by various means at on end where air introduced gas is recovered from vertical boreholes intersecting the in seam holes. A real problem with this method is that eventually the unsupported roef of the void thus created, will cave in, blockixig t e passage of air to che burn face. At depths great r than about 600 metres subsidence of the ground above the cavity may completely seal the cavity. Further problems arise in thin seams, particularly of bituminous coal, namcly in that it is difficult to obtain a wide burnout zone permitting wide lateral spacing and also as gasification continues, the gas quality falls as a result of air by passing the combustion zone and of conipletion of carbonization. As a means of avoiding the above problems it is proposed that using systems of in seam boreholes, air or other oxidant should be introduced along some of the boreholes and gas recovered from the remainder in contrast to current practice where all the air is introduced at the end remote from the gas offtakes.For ma.ny conditions, particularly with high rank coals, it is advisable alte nately to reverse the flow of gas and air in order to provide even burnout and to maintain a high temperature in the combustion zone. Unfortunately. this method is subject to a problem commonly referred to as burn back . Thus the hot air passing along the inlet channel causes combustion at tiie face at the far end of the channel, but instead of burning out a void in the seam which progressively moves back along the seam, the coal tends to burnback along the narrow inlet channel. This is of course highly inefficient as only a fraction of the aw ilable coal is burned. According to the present invention a method for the underground gasification of coal seams which comprises drilling two borehole into and along the seam and ling the boreholes at one end, passing an oxidant blast of air or oxygen along one of the boreholes from the unlinked end and recovering gas from the other borehole at its unlinked end, and injecting water either continuously or intermittently into said one borehole so as to minimise tJ 0 combustion of coal within the borehole and to control the position of the inc It will be appre iated that although a minimum of two boreholes are requi ed, any number grcater than that may be mpl yed. Thus boreholes may be arr nged in pairs, respcctively carrying oxidant blast and produced gas alternatively bereholes may be provided in trion, oxidant being passed along one and gas recovered from the remaining two boreholes. Other arrangements may also be envisaged according to the size and charact.er of the coal seam. Usually the ratio of oxidant to gas boreholes is from 1 1 to 1 5 Moreover, the role of the various boreholes may be reversed perioQically, the oxidant blast channels being switched to conduct the gas produced and oxidant being forced down the previous gas conducting channel. The boreholes may be drilled from an underground heading or by deviation drilling frcm the surface. In particular, for a steeply dipping seam the boreholes nay be drilled fro n the surface along the base cf the seam. Although the control water injection may be introduced continuously, preferably some is injected as an intermittent slug of water in an amount computer from the extent of combustion which has taken place in the system, the blast rate and the temperature and analysis of the gas produced, in order to reduce the burning back effect Waste water from the gas cleaning system used to clean the gas produced may be used as the control water. The control water may contain surplus tar byproduct, if desired. Thus dirty water may be used since the control water passes to the combustion zone. This can be particularly advantageous where water is in short ply, or of bad quality, or where for other reasons a complete waste water purification installation is difficult or expensive. The water injection system eliminates the need for a large steara generator, which is very costly for high pressure operation. The system also permits rye section to the combustion zone of particulate material recovered from the product gas. In low rank coal seams, however, it may be necessary to introduce the control water continuously in order to prevent the coal surface in the borehole from drying out. Carbon dioxide, water and or additional oxidant may be introduced through vertical or other boreholes in t,1e burned out zone in order to recover heat from the previously burned out region and to purge that zone of combustible gases. It will be appreciated that the number, size and location of the boreholes is a matter which is determined by the size and character of the coal seam being worked, and b the operating pressure. Similarl the blast rate will depend upon the coal and seam properties and the pressure, but these are matters which can be readily and routinely optimised for any given coal seam by experiment. The linking of the boreholes at the intended initial combustion zone can be achieved in a number of ways, the preferred method again depending to some extent upon the character of the coal. For example, linkage between boreholes may be achieved by air cr oxygen injcction, water injection, electrically or by drilling. Embodimonts of the invention will now be described with reference to the drawings wherein Figure 1 is a vertical cross section through a coal seam showing a meti tod of gasification according to the prior art,. Figure 2 is a horizontal cross sectional view of the prior ant arrangement shown in Figure 1, Figure 3 shows a first embodiment of the present invention enpleying a continuous parallel blast arrangement,Figure sh s a nd embcdiment of the present invention samitar to the first embodiment except that it is condse d cyeli ally, and Figure 5 is a horizontal cross sectional view of a third embodiment omployinq intersecting borchol Os. A prior art underground gasification method is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows air A being passed from the ground surface crown through an oxidant borehole 1 to a coal seam 5 having a combustion zone 6. Combustible gas prcduced by partial combustion of coal passes along gasification bore 7 d is withdrawn along gas horehole 2. Reference numeral 3 indicates an initial oxidant blast borehole which has now be superseded as the combustion zone moves forward, and a further blast borehore 4 which will come into use when the combustion zone reaches it.In this way, the coal seam is progressively burnt out, usually at the rate of a few meters a day. The gasification bores 7 have been drilled horizontally from a heading 1 shown in dashed lines. The heading formed the initial ignition and blast zone. Figure 3 shows a fist embodiment of the invention,A series of parallel boreholes 8, 9, 10 are drilled in the base of the coal seam 5 by drilling from a heading as before, cr by deviation drilling from the round surface.The borehole 8 transmits blast air to the combustion zone 6 and boreholes 9 and 10 recover combustible gas from the combustIon zone. Auxiliary gas, if required, is introduced via a verticai bore hole 12 into the burnt out region 13 behind the combustion zone. There is a tendency for coal to burn backwards along the air blast borehole 8, rather than burning between the borehole 8 and the adjacent gas boreholes 9 and 10. This tendency is reduced by injecting water and or steam into the borehole 8 along with air blast The water may bc injected continuously or iritermittently. When oxygen is employed instcad of air, water may be injected continuously with intermittent additions of slugs of water. This embodiment is particularly suitable for coals which shrink on drying lower rank coals . Figure 4 shows a similar arrangement to Figure 3 wherein the rcle of the parallel boreholes 8, 9 and 10 is cyclically vri according to arrangements 1, 2 and 3. Each borehole is fitted at the surface with a valve not shown to permit the connection of the borehole to either air, product gas, control water or to a purge mains for purging. The coiitrol pater system may be combined with a conventional water quenching o washing system used to treat the gas cxiting from the gas borehole. In this system ach borehole is used alternatively for air blast and for gas production. This embodimert allows any burn back which may occur on the air blast borehole to be equalised by switching the air blast between the various boreholes. Figure 5 shows a third embodiment wherein the linking of adjacent boreholes is achieved blr drilling along the se angled boreholes 11 which intersect in the desired combustion zone 6. As before, air A is introduced along one borehole and gas G is recovered along the other borehole. This technique removes the need to create linking channels between the various borers before combustion is initiated, and may be particularly advantageous for eep seam operation.
