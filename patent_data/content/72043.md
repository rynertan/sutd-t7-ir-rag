# Electrolytic production of aluminum.

## Abstract
In the electrolytic production of aluminium by elec trowinning or electrorefining processes, cell components such as cathode current feeders which in use are nor mally covered with molten aluminium are made of a composite material of aluminium or an aluminium alloy or intermetallic compound with an aluminium oxycompound, usually alumina, and possibly containing minor amounts of additives such as borides carbides, nitrides or oxides. The composite material, which remains mechanically stable and electrically conductive at 1000 C, may be prepared by hot pressing powders at 1000 1700 C possi bly after surface treating the alumina to improve wet tability by molten Al. The components are optionally coated, e.g. with TiBâ‚‚. The composite materials are also useful as non current carrying components, including sep arator walls, weirs, packing elements and baffles.
