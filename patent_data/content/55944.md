# Matrix switching system.

## Abstract
A matrix switching system ha N inputs and M outputs and three stages F, M, L of matrices. The first stage F includes n substage matrices 10a...10q , each with x inputs 16a...16q and x outputs 18a...18q where N equals nx. The second stage M provides x substage matrices 12a...12p each with n inputs 20a...20p and m outputs 22a...22p , an output 18a...18q from each first substage matrix 10a...10q being connected to an input 20a...20p of each second stage matrix 12a...12p . A third stage L employs m substage matrices 14a...14q each with x inputs 24a...24q and x outputs 26a...26q where M mx, an output 22a...22p from each second stage M being connected to an input 24a...24q of each third substage matrix 14a...14q . Switch ing means are provided at each node of each substage matrix. Means are provided for choosing a proper sequence of switches to reach a selected output to be connected to a selected input. By the addition of an extra input and output to each substate 12a...12p of the second stage M with output to input connections between all substages of that stage, it is possible to connect an input from one substage to an output in another. Such an arrangement in the middle stage of the three stage matrix, known as a midstage link 21 , allows conditionally non blocked re routing in situations where a substage appears to be blocked.
