# MACHINE FOR DRAWING OR CUTTING ELLIPSE

## Abstract
A machine for marking an ellipse on, or for cutting an ellip tical opening in, a sheet of material comprises a table structure 9 which is rotatable about an upstanding pin 15 and at the same time is reciprocated if the pin is displaced away from the centre of a circular bearing 5 which restrains the table struc ture. A marking instrument or cutting tool 35 is positioned above the table and can be offset from the pin so as to deter mine one of the axes of the ellipse while the other is determined by the offset of the pin from the centre of the bearing.
