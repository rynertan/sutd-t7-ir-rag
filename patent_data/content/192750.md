# HYDRAULIC ROTATES SYSTEM FOR SWING CRANE

## Claims
Hydraulisches Drehtriebwerk für einen Schwenkkran, bestehend aus einem Hydraulikkreislauf zwischen einer Hydraulikpumpe D und einem Hydraulikmotor A , einer um diesen Motor A umlaufenden Umleitung 7 und einem Ventil C zum Öffnen dieser Umleitung zwecks Drehung des Krans gemäss der Windrichtung und zum Schliessen der Umleitung, dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass eine einen Drosseldurchgang 8 aufweisende Drosselvorrichtung B der vorgenannten Umleitung 7 einverleibt ist und das Ventil C wahlweise betätigbar ist zum Schliessen der Umleitung zwecks Sicherung einer Bremswirkung wenn die Ölzufuhr ab der Hydraulikpumpe D unterbrochen ist und zum Öffnen derselben zwecks Ermöglichung einer beschränkten Startwirkung wenn die Ölzufuhr nach dem Motor A stattfindet.

## Description
The present invention concerns a hydraulic rotational drive system for a swing crane, comprising a hydraulic circuit between a hydraulic pump and a hydraulic motor, a by pass by passing said motor, and valve means for opening said by pass, to allow the crane to rotate according to the wind and for closing said by pass. A system of this kind is known from US patent specification no 4 013 174 and is adapted for normal swing drive operations by allowing respective functions for start, stop and for unimpeded rotation according to the wind. According to the invention, throttling means having a throttling passage, are incorporated in said by pass and the valve means are selectively operable to close the by pass thus ensuring a brake function when the oil supply from the hydraulic pump is interrupted, and to open the by pass to provide a reduced start function when the supply is applied to the motor. In this way, a pressure difference across the motor can be achieved which allows a reduced start of a rotation movement. Additionally, said throttling means can allow the boom of the swing crane to rotate freely but nevertheless with a controlled speed away from the wind when the crane is left in an inoperative condition. A preferred embodiment of the hydraulic system according to the invention is schematically shown in the drawing. The system comprises a hydraulic rotary motor A, which is provided with inlet outlet ports 1,2 for hydraulic oil. In the present example said motor serves as a drive and control aggregate for the rotating movements of a swing crane. To this end, said ports 1 and 2 are connected with a hydraulic circuit 3,4, which extends from inlet outlet ports 5,6 of a steering valve marked D provided in the line from a hydraulic pump. Moreover, said hydraulic circuit 3,4 comprises a by pass 7 which provides a short circuit between the branches 3 and 4 of said medium circuit, thus by passing said motor A. Said by pass 7 comprises a shunt valve C, which is adapted to be kept in an open or in a closed position, and a throttling device B with a passage 8. Depending on the position of the shunt valve C, either all hydraulic oil will be circulated from the pump through the open steering valve D to the motor A, when said shunt valve is closed, or part of said supply will by pass said motor, when the shunt valve C is opened. Thus, said throttling device B will, when the shunt valve C is in open position, serves as a hydraulic damping means, which borrows its operative oil from the ordinary hydraulic circuit.
