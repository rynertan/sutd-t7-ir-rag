# Optical hydraulic control system.

## Abstract
A optical hydraulic control wherein the flow of hydraulic fluid is controlled by movement of a valve spool 12 . Movement of the valve spool 12 is initiated by a hydraulic pressure differential that is established by moving a control member 34 out of an equilibrium position. Movement of the control member 34 from its equilibrium position is accomplished by illumination of a composite thermally sensitive beam 38, 40 with an optical command signal. The control member 34 is returned to its equilibrium position after appropriate movement of the valve spool 12 by mechanical linkage between the control member 34 and the valve spool 12 or, alternatively by modulation of the optical command signal.
