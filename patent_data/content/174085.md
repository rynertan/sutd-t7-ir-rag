Prefered values for R11 and Rgl include 3,5 dichlorophenyl, 3 chlorophenyl, 3,4 dimethylphenyl, 3,4 methylenediaxyphenyl, 3,4 dimethoxyphenyl and 3,4,5 trimethoxyphenyl.There is another group of compounds within formula I of formula IIa EMI5.1 wherein R11 to R41 and R71 to Rgl are as defined in formula II . Suitable and preferred values for R11 to R41 and R71 to Rgl are as described for the corresponding variables under formula II . It will of course be realised that the compounds of formula I possess two chiral centres and therefore exist in more than one stereoisomeric form. The invention extends to any of the stereoisometric forms, including enantiomers of the compounds of the invention and to mixtures thereof, including racemates. The different stereoisomeric forms may be separated or resolved one from the other by the usual methods or any given isomer may be obtained by stereospecific or asymmetric syntheses. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I include acid addition salts with conventional acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, boric, phosphoric, sulphuric and pharmaceutically acceptable organic acids such as acetic, tartaric, maleic, citric, succinic, benzoic, ascorbic, methanesulphonic, a keto glutaric, a glycerophosphoric, and glucose l phosphoric acids. Preferably the acid addition salt is a hydrochloride.Pharmaceutically acceptable salts also include quaternary salts. Examples of quaternary salts include such compounds quaternised by compounds such as R12 T wherein R12 is C16 alkyl, phenyl C16 alkyl or C57 cycloalkyl, and T is a radical corresponding to an anion of an acid. Suitable examples of R12 include methyl, ethyl and n and iso propyl and benzyl and phenethyl. Suitable T include halide such as chloride, bromide and iodide. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts also include pharmaceutically acceptable N oxides, and the invention extends to these.The compounds of the formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may also form solvates with pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and the invention extends to these.It will also be realised that salts of the compounds of the formula I which are not pharmaceutically acceptable may be useful as intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the formula I or the compounds of the formula I themselves, and as such form an aspect of the present invention.The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which process comprises reacting a compound of formula III EMI7.1 with a compound of formula IV L CO R13 IV wherein R4 and R6, are R4 and R6 or N protecting groups,one of Rl and R9 is hydrogen and the other is COR1 or COR9 respectively or when R1 and Rg are the same group, R1,and Rg may both be hydrogen R13 is Rg when R1 is hydrogen and or R1 when Rg is hydrogen and L is a leaving group, and thereafter removing R4 and or R6 when protecting groups and or optionally converting R21R4,R6 or R5 when hydrogen to other R2,R4,R6, or R8 and or optionally forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The leaving group L is a group readily displaceable by a nucleophile. Suitable examples of L are hydroxy, halogen such as chloro and bromo and acyloxy such as C14 alkanoyloxy, C14 alkoxycarbonyloxy and activated hydrocarbyloxy such as pentachlorophenoxy.If the leaving group is hydroxy, then the reaction is preferably carried out in an inert non hydroxylic solvent, such as benzene, toluene or diethyl ether in the presence of a dehydrating catalyst, such as a carbodiimide, for example dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.The reaction may be carried out at a non extreme temperature such as 10 to 1000C, for example 0 to 80 C. If the leaving group is a halide, then the reaction is preferably carried out at a non extreme temperature in an inert non hydroxylic solvent, such as benzene, toluene or diethyl ether. It is also preferably carried out in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as an organic base, in particular a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine, trimethylamine, pyridine or picoline, some of which can also function as a solvent.Alternatively, the acid acceptor can be inorganic, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate.If the leaving group is acyloxy, then the reaction is preferably carried in substantially the same manner as if the leaving group were hydroxy. Suitable examples of acyloxy leaving groups include C14 alkanoyloxy, mesyloxy, tosyloxy and triflate. If the leaving group is C1 4 alkoxycarbonyloxy, then the reaction is preferably carried out in an inert solvent, such as methylenechloride, at a non extreme temperature in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as triethylamine.If the leaving group is activated hydrocarbyloxy then the reaction is preferably carried out in an inert polar solvent, such as dimethylformamide. It is also preferred that the activated hydrocarbyloxy group is a pentachlorophenyl ester and that the reaction is carried out at ambient temperature.It will be appreciated that1 when R1 and Rg are both hydrogen in the compound of formula III i.e. when R1 and Rg are the same group in the compound of formula I , two molar equivalents of the compound of formula IV are necessary to complete the reaction to give the desired compound of formula I .Examples of N protecting groups include C16 alkanoyl, for example acetyl, propionyl, n and iso butyryl and 2,2 dimethylpropanoyl, benzoyl or benzene optionally substituted in the phenyl ring by one or two substituents selected from C14 alkyl, C14 alkoxy, trifluoromethyl, halogen or nitro and C14 alkoxycarbonyl, for example tert butoxycarbonyl.Conversion of protected amino to amino may be effected conventionally. lçhen the protecting group is C16 alkanoyl or optionally substituted benzoyl as defined conversion to amino is conveniently effected by conventional base hydrolysis.When the protecting group is C14 alkoxycarbonyl or optionally substituted benzyl as defined, conversion to amino may be carried out conventionally, for example by hydrogenolysis. Suitable reactions are conventionally transition metal catalysed hydrogenation, using for example palladium or platinum charcoal, at atmospheric pressure or a light excess thereover. A dry, inert, polar solvent such as dry ethanol and ambient temperatures are apt.Subsequent conversion of R2,R4,R6 or R8 when hydrogen to other R2,R4,R6 or R8 may be carried out by conventional amine alkylation, for example with the appropriate aldehyde or ketone in a solvent such as acetonitrile, in the presence of a reducing agent such as an alkaline borohydride e.g. sodium cyanoborohydride.Pharmaceutically acceptable salts including N oxides of the compounds of formula I may be formed conventionally. The salts may be formed for example by reaction of the base compound of formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic acid.N oxides are produced by reaction of a compound of formula I with an organic peracid, such as m chloroperbenzoic acid in, for example, a chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent at below ambient temperature. Quaternary ammonium salts may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula I with the appropriate alkyl, aryl or aralkyl, chloride, bromide or iodide.This reaction may be carried out in a solvent, such as acetone, methanol, ethanol or dimethylformamide, at ambient or elevated temperature with or without pressure.Racemates of compounds of the formula I may be resolved conventionally, e.g., by salification with a chiral acid if appropriate and separation of the resultant salts.Alternatively, either may be synthesised from corresponding chiral preceeding intermediates. A compound of the formula III in which R1S,R2, R4, Rs, R6,,R8 and R9,are each hydrogen, R3 and R7 are each ethyl, m is 1 and n is 0, has been described in Ann.N.Y. Acad. Sci. 135 1966 , p.686 710, R.G. Shepherd et al., on page 705.The invention also provides intermediates of the formula III with the proviso that when R1S, R2, R4 , R5 , R6 , R8 and R9 are each hydrogen, R3 and R7 are each ethyl and m is 1, n is other than 0.Compounds of formula III wherein one of Rl and Rg is COR1 or COR9 respectively are prepared by reacting the compound of formula V EMI12.1 with a compound of formula VI L1 COR14 VI wherein one of Rl and R9 is hydrogen and the other is a protecting group, R14 is R1 or Rg and L1 is a leaving group and therafter removing an R1 R9 protecting group.The leaving group L1 is a group readily displaceable by a nucleophile. Suitable and preferred values for L1 are described for L as hereinbefore defined. The reaction is carried out in an analogous manner to that between compounds of formulae III and IV .De protection may suitably be effected as described above for hydrogenolysable protected amino, under conventional conditions.It will be appreciated that the necessity and order of deprotection protection and the order of attachment atR1 R9 will depend in the nature of these groups and the appropriate reaction sequence selected.Compounds of the formula III wherein R1 and Rg are both hydrogen, may be prepared by conventional procedures from compounds of formula VII EMI13.1 where Y is a cyano group or a group CH2X where X is a leaving group such as halo or hydroxy. When Y is cyano, the procedure is a reduction with, for example,LiAlH4 in diethylether, diborane, or hydrogen overRaney nickel in the presence of ammonia, when Y isCH2X, the procedure is a nucleophilic substitution by ammonia or a primary or secondary amine under conventional conditions appropriate for the leaving group X. Thus, when X is hydroxy, it is first converted into a good leaving group such as mesylate tosylate or chloride.Compounds of formulae V and VII are known from, or may be prepared by processes analogous to those described in, British Patent Specification 961317.Compounds of formulae IV and VI are known compounds or may be prepared by processes analogous to those use for preparing known compounds. Rne compounds of formula I have cardiovascular, in particular calcium antagonistic activity.In order to utilise the activity of the compounds of formula I the invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a solvate of any of the foregoing, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.Such compositions are prepared by admixture and are suitably adapted for oral or parenteral administration, and as such may be in the form of tablets, capsules, oral liquid preparations, powders, granules, lozenges, reconstitutable powders, injectable and infusable solutions or suspensions or suppositories. Orally administrable compositions are preferred, in particular shaped oral compositions, since they are more convenient for general use.Tablets and capsules for oral administration are usually presented in a unit dose, and contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, diluents, tabletting agents, lubricants, disintegrants, colourants, flavourings, and wetting agents. The tablets may be coated according to well known methods in the art.Suitable fillers for use include cellulose, mannitol, lactose and other similar agents. Suitable disintegrants include starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone and starch derivatives such as sodium starch glycollate. Suitable lubricants include, for example, magnesium stearate. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents include sodium lauryl sulphate.These solid oral compositions may be prepared by conventional methods of blending, filling, tabletting or the like. Repeated blending operations may be used to distribute the active agent throughout those compositions employing large quantities of fillers.Such operations are, of course, conventional in the art.Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminium stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats, emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia non aqueous vehicles which may include edible oils , for example, almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as esters of glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol preservatives, for example methyl or propyl hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid, and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents.For parenteral administration, fluid unit dose forms are prepared containing a compound of the present invention and a sterile vehicle. The compound, depending on the vehicle and the concentration, can be either suspended or dissolved. Parenteral solutions are normally prepared by dissolving the compound in a vehicle and filter sterilising before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservatives and buffering agents are also dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum.Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound of the invention. In addition such compositions may contain further active agents such as anti hypertensive agents and diuretics.As is common practice, the compositions will usually be accompanied by written or printed directions for use in the medical treatment concerned.The invention further provides a method of treatment or prophylaxis of angina in mammals, such as humans, which comprises the administration of an effective amount of a compound of formula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a solvate of any of the foregoing as hereinbefore defined, to the sufferer. An amount effective to treat the disorders hereinbefore described depends on the relative efficacies of the compounds of the formula I , the nature and severity of the disorders being treated and the weight of the mammal. However, a unit dose will normally contain 1 to 100 mg for example 2 to 50 mg, of the compound of the invention. Unit doses will normally be administered once or more than once a day, for example 2,3,4,5 or 6 times a day, more usually 2 to 4 times a day, such that the total daily dose is normally in the range, for a 70 kg adult of 0.1 to 2500 mg, more usually 50 to 2000 mg, for example 10 to 75mg, that is in the range of approximately 0.002 to 35 mg kg day, more usually 1 to 30 mg kg day, for example 0.15 to 1 mg kg day.The invention also provides a compound of formula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a solvate of any of the foregoing as hereinbefore defined, for use as an active therapeutic substance, and particularly for the treatment or prophylaxis of angina.The following examples illustrate the invention and the following descriptions illustrate intermediates thereto.

Antiarrhythmic activityCompound El infused at 2.5mg min in the ear vein of conscious rabbits inhibited the arrhythmogenic effect of suprathreshold cardiac electric stimulation. The therapeutic index, i.e. the ratio between the dose of compound required to produce A V block 8 mg kg and that dose which gave an antiarrhythmic effect 0.9mg kg was 8.9.2. Antianginal activityCompound El reduced ST segment elevation in the ECG of anaesthetized rats following i.v injection of 1I.U. kg vasopressin significantly, the minimum effective i.v. antianginal dose being 0.2 mg kg.3. Ca antagonistic activityIn guinea pig papillary muscle 34 loC in vitro, theCompound El 1 3 x 10 6M depressed the maximal rate of rise Vmax of calcium dependent action potentials evoked in krebs medium containing 26 nM K and 0.5 nM, BaC12. These action potentials were recorded using conventional intracellular techniques.4. Vasopressin test in anaesthetized ratsVasopressin Lysopressin 1 I.U. kg was administered intravenously in order to provoke coronary spasm.Compound El was active against coronary spasm at a dose of 32mg kg i.d. with a duration of action greater than 2 hours. The ability of test compounds to reduce coronary spasm is taken as a measure of their anti anginal potential in spasm induced angina pectoris. Ref. Drug.Res. 33 11 , 8,1117 1121 1983 .5. Haemodynamic profile in anaesthetized ratsThe effect of compounds of the invention on heart rate, systolic left ventricular pressure, left ventricular dp dt max and mean arterial blood pressure was investigated so as to obtain information on the anti anginal potential of these compounds, by reduciny the oxygen demand of the ischaemic heart.

Of special interest is the bradycardic activity of some test compounds. The activity of compound El after intraduodenal administation suggests that the claimed compounds are well absorbed and or show high metabolic stability.ToxicityNo toxic effects were observed in the above tests.
