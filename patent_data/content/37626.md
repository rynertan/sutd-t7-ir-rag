# ACCELERATION OR INCLINATION MEASURING INSTRUMENT

## Abstract
A measuring instrument is described for measuring incli nation or acceleration. For inclination only three strings are required. For acceleration four strings are required. The instrument comprises a mass 38 suspended by three or four stretched strings 32, 34, 36 or 70, 72, 74 and 76 with the strings being suspended from terminals within a frame 10 . The strings are conductive as is also the mass 38 and a flexible electrical connection 46 allows connection to be made to the star point of the three or four conductive strings. The strings form the frequency determining elements in the outputs of negative resistance amplifiers 50, 52, 54 etc., and differential amplifiers 56, 58, 60 together with decoding circuits 62 provide output signals for a computing device 64 which inturn provides data for an indicator 66 to indicate the inclination of the frame 10 relative to some datum. Calib rating means 68 is provided for calibrating the read out device 66 . Where four strings are employed a further display device 94 may be provided to indicate the magnitude of the accelerating force, the first display device 66 indicat ing the direction in which the accelerating force is acting. In one embodiment a generally triangular mass 108 is cut away on it s underside to allow it to rest on three limbs 120, 122, 124 of a spider having an integral central webb 188 which is secured to the triangular weight 108 . The limbs of the spider are secured at their ends to mounting blocks one of which is resiliently biased in an ontward direc tion to tension the spider. The underside of the triangular mass 108 is formed with protrusions 154 for engaging in locating channels 156 formed in the base of a retaining housing 100 .
