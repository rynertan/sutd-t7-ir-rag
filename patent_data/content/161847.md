# METERING ARRANGEMENT

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a liquid metering arrange ment including a liquid meter 1 and at least one sample chamber 4 in communication therewith transfer means 3 being provided to allow for the passage of liquid from said meter 1 into said sample chamber 4 valve means being pro vided in association with said transfer means 3 an air inlet 6 being provided adjacent an upper portion of the sample chamber 4 and having valve means 7 associated therewith a liquid outlet pipe 14 being provided within said sample chamber 4 and extending out of an upper portion thereof, so as to be connectable to a sub sampler 12 the arrangement being such that on an amount of liquid being present within said sample chamber 4 , said valving 7 associated with said air in let 6 into said sample chamber 4 is opened allowing an inlet of air, thereby causing closure of said valving associated with the liquid transfer means 3 and further causing liquid within the sample chamber 4 to pass through the liquid outlet pipe 14 to said sub sampler 12 . There is also provided a sample arrangement for obtaining a sample of liquid from a liquid flow, including a housing 60 liquid inlet and outlet means 20, 21 being provided a liquid flow line 23 extending therebetween and within said housing 60 a chamber 30 being provided and adapted so as to releasably engage a sample vial or container 40 said liquid flow line 23 being in communication with said chamber 30 such that a proportion of liquid passing through said liquid flow line 23 is able to pass into said chamber 40 .
