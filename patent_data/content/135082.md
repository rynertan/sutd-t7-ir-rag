# Coupling device with hinged retaining catches.

## Abstract
Coupling device with hinged retaining catches made up basically of two concentric cylindrical parts 1, 9 , the inner one of which extends frontally by means of clamping catches 2 provided on their inner face with retention toothing 3 , these catches 2 being joined to the cylindrical body 1 of which they form a part, by hinges 4 which are integrated through the thinning of the actual material of which they are made, thereby offering said catches 2 the possibility of swivelling although with a constant tendency to separate in relation to the longitudinal axis of the cylindrical body of which they form a part.
