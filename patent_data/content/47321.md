## Description
Description AGNETIC RECORDING MEDIU,i TECHi ICAL FIELD This invention relates to a magnetic recording medium, such as magnetic tape, card, or disk, obtained by exposure to radiation. BACKGROUND ART magnetic recording media in varied forms of cassette, open reel, and video tapes, and also as magnetic cards and disks, etc. are generally made today by coating a base of polyester, polyvinyl chloride, or polyacetate film, or sheet of paper with a coating material, printing ink, or other coating composition containing iron oxide or other magnetizable metal oxide or metallic material a coating material being dealt with, by way of example, in the following description , and subjecting the coated film to further steps of orientation, drying, and, where necessary, curing.As a resin binder for the coating material, a vinyl chloride copolymer, polyurethane, polyacrylic ester, or sometimes an epoxy resin or the like is employed. It is also customary to add, according to the intended use of the end product, some plasticizer, rubber, dispersant, antistatic agent, pigment, and or other additives. While there is a wide choice of binders, a curing type binder, e.g., a thermosetting resin, is preferred because of its favorable effects upon the physical properties, such as resistances to wear, heat, and solvents, of the products. A routine practice with the tapes using thermosetting magnetic coating materials, e.g., video, hi fi audio cassette, and computer tapes, magnetic disks, and endless tapes, has been to place the coated tapes in an 0 oven for many hours e.g., at 70 C for 2 20 hours to bake the coats and attain better physical properties. This has, however, posed problems of tape deformations due to blocking of the coating material and tightness in winding and also deterioration of electrical characteristics due to unsmoothening of the magnetically coated surface. For certain applications, it is common to use a primer in order to improve the adherence between the base film and the coating layer thereon or apply an overcoat to the magnetic coat so as to increase the wear resistance or the stability of the tape on repeated usage. The present invention provides a magnetic recording medium capable of solving the foregoing problems. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION Irradiation of the coating material according to the invention with electron bearns or the like will cause the unsaturated double bonds in the coating to form radicals, which in turn will initiate polymerization to produce a magnetic coating film of a three dirnensional network structure and cure it instantaneously at a low temperature.In this way a smooth magnetic coating surface is obtained through a simple process without the necessity of after curing, and some low molecular component is dried, at the same time. Meanwhile, the use of a radiation curable, high molecular compound will give a coating film of good physical properties which is rigid and yet highly flexible.Thus, the present invention permits the manufacture of a magnetic tape with excellent dimensional stability, surface smoothness, and other properties within a short time by a simplified process, and is concerned with a magnetic recording medium which exhibits, in addition to the foregoing attributes, a superior adherence between the substrate and the coating layer thereon without the aid ofa primer or the like.In brief, the magnetic recording medium of the invention is made by using A a compound having two or more radiation curable, unsaturated double bonds and a molecular weight of not less than 5000, preferably not less than 8000, B a compound having one or more radiation curable, unsaturated double bonds and a molecular weight of over 400 and less than 5000, preferably in the range of6000 3000, and C a compound having one or more radiation curable, unsaturated double bonds and a molecular weight of less than 400, coating a substrate with a magnetic material composed essentially of a binder which is a mixture of the compounds A and B or of A , B , and C , magnetic particles, and a solvent, predrying the coating, and then irradiating the coated matter with radioactive rays.Desirably, the compound A is one prepared by reacting either a partly saponified vinyl chloridevinyl acetate copolymer or a vinyl chloride vinyl alcohol copolymer, obtained by saponifying almost all of the acetyl groups of the vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer, with a polyisocyanate compound, and then reacting the resulting isocyanate containing compound with an acrylic or methacrylic compound having a functional group reactive with the isocyanate group, and the compound B is one prepared by reacting a polyol with a polyisocyanate compound and then reacting the resulting isocyanate containing compound with an acrylic or methacrylic compound having a functional group reactive with the isocyanate group.The mixing ratio of the compounds A , B , and C is such that the objective radiation curable resin composition consists of 20 95 wt , preferably 50 90 wt , of A , 0 80 wt, preferably 10 50 wt , of B , and 0 50 wt , preferably 5 20 wt, of C . This composition, when used together with an additional binder component which is a thermoplastic resin free of any radiation curable, unsaturated double bond, will allow the resulting medium to retain well balanced physical properties including flexibility. As a magnetic coating material using an electronbeam curable resin, the one according to Japanese PatentApplication Public. Disclosure No. 7 433 1975 is known to the art. When a compound containing acrylic double bonds and having a molecular weight of more than 400 is employed singly, there will be a tendency of decreased electronbeam curability because of the functional group density with an increase in molecular weight. Consequently, a large dose of radiation becomes necessary and the heat resistance tends to decline with less curability. The magnetic recording medium incorporating such a coating material, when served for practical use, will have troubles, such as improper running, inadequate durability, head choking, and dropouts. With regard to the flexibility of the cured coating layer, the higher the degree of filling of the magnetic material, the more brittle and the less wear resistant the magnetic coating layer will be. Further, with an increase in molecular weight, the viscosity of the coating material will increase, necessitating an increase in proportion of the solvent to be used for the dilution purpose. Also, the increased molecular weight will undergo material shrinkage in the course of coating film formation, resulting in reduced surface smoothness of the coating layer, roughening of the surface at the time of magnetic field orientation, and deteriorated coating adaptability.For the dispersibility of the magnetic particles, on the other hand, proper molecular weight and molecular weight distribution are desirable, and the electromagnetic conversion characteristics of the resulting magnetic coating layer will tend to depend on the dispersibility, surface smoothness, and orientation of the magnetic particles. As for the bonding, it is sometimes the case with the coating material that the bonding ability will drop with an increase in curability or will be insufficient where a high polymer alone is used. On the other hand, an electron beam curable resin having a molecular weight of less than 400 will give a coating material with good electron beam curability and satisfactory resistances to solvents and heat, but also with inadequate flexibility, wear resistance, dispersibility, coatability, and electrical characteristics. Thus, where a compound containing acrylic double bonds and having a molecular weight of more than 400 or less than 400 is used alone, it is difficult to obtain a magnetic coating material which is balanced and satisfactory in the varied properties required of a magnetic recording medium. The above mentioned compounds A , B , and C for use in the present invention, when adopted singly, will prove radiation curable but will not always give a magnetic coating material of good physical properties. It is by mixing the compounds A , B , and C of different molecular weights that curability is attained even with a low dosage of about 1 3 mrads and many different physical property requirements can be met. Especially, the binders consisting of the A B and A B C combinations are superior to the binder of the A C combination in bonding ability, flexibility, etc. For the purposes of the invention the term radiation curable, unsaturated double bonds is used to mean the unsaturated double bonds having radical polymerizability.They include acrylic double bonds of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and their ester compounds, allylic double bonds as of diallyl phthalate, and unsaturated bonds as of maleic acid and maleic acid derivatives. Other unsaturated double bonds may be employed provided they are curable upon exposure to radiation. Of those, preferred are acrylic double bonds. As the binder components A , B , and C for use in the present invention, the following compounds may be cited for examples I. Reaction products obtained by reacting a compound having at least one hydroxyl group in the molecule with one isocyanate group of a polyisocyanate compound, at a rate of one molecule of the former to one or more molecules of the latter, and then reacting the resultant with one or more molecules of a monomer having a group reactive with the isocyanate group and having radiation curable unsaturated double bonds.Examples are the resins, prepolymers , oligomers, and telomers having two acrylic double bonds at the end of the molecule, prepared, e.g., by reacting one mole of a bifunctional polyether marketed by Asahi DenkaKogyo A.K. under the trade designation ADENS polyetherP 1000 , obtained by adding propylene oxide to propylene glycol, with two moles of toluene diisocyanate and then with two moles of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate. The compounds containing one or more hydroxyl groups and which may be employed here are, e.g., polyfunctional polyethers, such as ADEKA Polyether P 700 , ADEKA Polyether P 1000 , and ADEliA Polyether G 1500 all made byAsahi Denka Kogyo K.K. and Polymeg 1000 and Polymeg 650 both made by The Quaker Oats Co. cellulose derivatives, such as nitrocellulose, acetyl cellulose, and ethyl cellulose hydroxyl containing, partly saponified vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymers and vinyl chloridevinyl alcohol copolymers, such as Vinylite VAGH made by Union Carbide Corp. of the U.S. and Sekisui Chemical of Japan under the trademark A 5 polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl formals polyvinyl butyrals, polyfunctional polyesters, such as Niax polycaprolactone polyols PCP 0200 , PCP 0240 , and polyol PCP 0300 all made by UCC of the U.S. saturated polyester resins prepared by the ester linkage of a saturated polybasic acid, such as phthalic, isophthalic, terephthalic, adipic, succinic, or sebacic acid, with a polyhydric alcohol, such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,4 butanediol, 1,3 butanediol, 1,2 propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, 1,6 hexane glycol, neopentyl glycol, glycerin, trimethylolpropane, or pentaerythritol and acrylic polymers containing at least one type of hydroxyl containing acrylic or methacrylic esters as the polymer component.

The monomers having groups reactive with the isocyanate group and also having radiation curable, unsaturated double bonds include hydroxyl containing esters, such as 2hydroxyethyl ester, 2 hydroxypropyl ester, and 2 hydroxyoctyl ester, of acrylic and methacrylic acids monomers having active hydrogen reactive with the isocyanate group and also having acrylic double bonds, such as acrylarnide, methacrylamide, and N methylolacrylamide and monomers having active hydrogen reactive with the isocyanate group and also containing radiation curable, unsaturated double bonds, such as allyl alcohols, maleic acid esters of polyhydric alcohols, and mono and diglycerides of long chain fatty acids having unsaturated double bonds.II. Reaction products of a compound having at least one epoxy group in the molecule and a monomer having groups reactive with the epoxy group and also having radiationcurable, unsaturated double bonds, at a rate of one molecule of the former to one or more molecules of the latter. Examples are the resins, propolymers, and oligomers which carry acrylic double bonds in pendant fashion in the molecules, obtained by radical polymerization of glycidyl methacrylate and a further reaction of the resulting epoxy containing thermoplastic resin with acrylic acid, thereby effecting a ring opening reaction of the carboxyl and epoxy groups. Also included are the resins, prepolymers, and oligomers having radiation curable, unsaturated double bonds in the molecular frame as a result of the ring opening reaction of the carboxyl and epoxy groups due to a reaction of the epoxy containing thermoplastic resin with maleic acid. The compounds containing one or more epoxy groups in the molecule include homopolymers of epoxy containing acrylic ester or methacrylic ester, such as glycidyl acrylate and glycidyl methacrylate, or their copolymers with other polymerizable monomers, such as 1Epikote 828 , Epikote 1001 , Epikote 1007, and Epikote 1009 all made byShell Chemical Co. . Various other types of epoxy resins may also be employed. Among the monomers having the group reactive with the epoxy group and also having radiation curable, unsaturated double bonds are carboxyl containing acrylic monomers, such as acrylic and methacrylic acids, and acrylic monomers having primary or secondary amino groups, such as methylaminoethyl acrylate and methylaminoethyl methacrylate.In addition, polybasic acid monomers having radiationcurable, unsaturated double bonds, such as maleic, fumaric, crotonic, and undecylenic acids, may be used.III. Reaction products of a compound containing at least one carboxyl group in the molecule and a monomer having groups reactive with the carboxyl group and also having radiation curable, unsaturated double bonds, at a rate of one molecule of the former to one or more molecules of the latter. Examples are the resins, prepolymers, and oligomers obtained by solution polymerization of methacrylic acid and a reaction of the resulting carboxylcontaining thermoplastic resin with glycidyl methacrylate, and further introduction of acrylic double bonds into the molecules, in the same manner as in Section II above, by the ring opening reaction of carboxyl and epoxy groups. The compounds that contain one or more carboxyl groups in the molecule are the polyesters containing carboxyl groups in the molecular chain or at the end of a chain in the molecule the homopolymers of monomers having the radical polymerizability and containing carboxyl groups, such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic anhydride, and fumaric acid and their copolymers with other polymerizable monomers. The monomers that have the groups reactive with the carboxyl groups and have radiation cu able, unsaturated double bonds are glycidyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, etc.IV. Polyester compounds containing radiation curable, unsaturated double bonds in the molecular chain, They may include, e.g., the unsaturated polyester resins formed by the ester linkage of a polybasic acid and a polyhydric alcohol, mentioned in I above, part of the polybasic acid being maleic acid, and containing radiation curable, unsaturated double bonds and prepolymers and oligomers of those resins. The polybasic acid and polyhydric alcohol components of the saturated polyester resins may be the compounds referred to in I above, and examples of the radiationcurable, unsaturated double bonds are maleic acid and fumaric acid. The radiation curable, unsaturated polyester resins are prepared by adding maleic acid, fumaric acid or the like to at least one polybasic acid component and at least one polyhydric alcohol component, and treating the mixture in the usual manner, i.e., effecting a dehydration or dealcoholization reaction in the presence of a catalyst and in a nitrogen atmosphere at 1800 2000C, and increasing the temperature to the range of 2 O0 2800C, and then subjecting the resultant to a condensation reaction under a reduced pressure of 0.5 1 mmHg. In this way the objective polyester resin is obtained.The product may contain maleic acid, fumaric acid or the like in the range of 1 40 mol , preferably 10 30 mol , on the basis of the total acid quantity, depending on the crosslinking condition during the manufacture, radiation curability and other properties of the product.V. Low molecular compounds having radiation curable, unsaturated double bonds may also be employed according to the intended uses. Examples of such low molecular compounds are styrene, ethylacrylate, ethylene glycol diacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diethylene glycol diacrylate, diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,5 hexane glycol diacrylate, 1 ,6 hexane glycol dimethacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, and trimethylol propane trimethacrylate. The compounds in this SectionV. mostly fall under the category of the compounds C In the present invention the compounds referred to in SectionsI through V may be employed as components of a binder for magnetic coating material.Thus, a mixture of A a compound having two of more radiation curable, unsaturated bonds and a molecular weight of not less than 5000, preferably not less than 8000, B a compound having a radiation curable, unsaturated double bonds and a molecular weight of over 400 and less than 5000, preferably in the range of 600 3000, and C a compound having a radiation curable, unsaturated double bonds and a molecular weight of less than 400, in a mixing ratio by weight of 20 95, preferably 50 90 A , 0 80, preferably 10 50 B , and 0 50, preferably 5 20 C , is used. Mere the compound A , having a molecular weight of 5000 or more, preferably 8000 or more, is an all the more flexible compound, e.g., t Vinylite VAGH or the like which is a partly saponified vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer, it will impart flexibility to the coating material but will prove somewhat inferior in radiation curability and adhesion to the base. The singular use of the compound A will present other problems, such as increased viscosity of the magnetic coating material. Then, lower molecular compounds excellently compatible with the component A are used as the component B and or the component c , so as to increase the cross linking density, improve radiation curability, and impart good adhesion to the substrate. The use of such low molecular compounds will lower the viscosity and improve the coatability of the magnetic coating material, further improving the dispersibility of the magnetic particles in the coating composition.Where a compound incapable of imparting excellent flexibility is used as the component A , compounds capable of conferring radiatiion curability and adhesion to the base on the coating material and which are satisfactorily compatible with the component A may be mixed with it as the component B and or the component C . If they are plastic they can give flexibility to the cured coating film. Any combination of compounds both exceeding 5000 in molecular weight would not produce such an improved radiation curability as by a low molecular compound or compounds. Moreover, the high molecular combination would make the magnetic coating material too viscous for smooth, trouble free application. For these reasons the component A must be combined with a compound or compounds less than 5000 in molecular weight, such as B and or C . When the component A alone is employed, it will be impossible to obtain adequate radiation curability and other desirable physical properties, as already noted above. Hence the component B and or the component C is required, preferably 10 or more by weight tB3 and or 5 or more by weight C . If the component B exceeds 80 wt , or if the component C exceeds 50 wt , the magnetic coating material will have poor flexibility, dispersibility, etc., failing to meet various other physical property requirements. According to the present invention, it is possible to improve the radiation curability and flexibility by using a compound having only one unsaturated double bond instead of two or more as the component B or C . Also, under the invention, a partly saponified vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer having a molecular weight of 5000 or more, preferably 8000 or more, into which radiation curable, unsaturated double bonds have been introduced may be used as the component A , and a polyol having a molecular weight of not less than 400 and less than 5000, preferably in the range of 600 3000, incorporating a radiation curable, insaturated double bond or bonds may be used as the component B , and the two may be mixed in an A B ratio by weight in the range from 20 80 to 95 5, preferably from 50 50 to 80 20, to prepare a binder.Then, an exposure to a low dosage of 3 mrads or less will be effective enough to give a magnetic recording medium excellent in radiation curability adhesion to the base. and other physical properties required of the medium.In order to balance the flexibility and other properties of the product, the binder according to the invention may contain as an additional component a thermoplastic resin free from any radiation curable, unsaturated bond. Among useful thermoplastic resins for this purpose are vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer and other vinyl chloride resins, polyester resins, polyvinyl alcohol resins, epoxy resins, cellulose derivatives, thermoplastic polyurethane resins, polyamide resins, and acrylic resins. The addition of such a thermoplastic resin is effective in balancing flexibility and other properties of the product. In practice of the invention a solvent is employed.When the magnetic particles to binder ratio by weight is controlled within the range from 85 15 to 65 35 in view of the magnetic properties and the bonding ability required of the coating layer to be formed on the base layer, the solvent is used to adjust the solids content of the magnetic coating material in the range of 20 60 wt , preferably of 25 40 wt . In this way a magnetic coating material with desirable application properties can be obtained. There is no special limitation to the solvent, and a suitable one may be chosen in consideration of the binder solubility, compatibility, etc. It may, for example, be a ketone, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, or cyclohexanone an ester, such as ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, or butyl acetate an alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or butanol an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as toluene, xylene or ethylbenzene an ether, such as isopropyl ether, ethyl ether, or dioxane or a furan, such as tetrahydrofuran or furfural.These are used as either a single solvent or mixed solvent. Predrying is effected primarily for the removal of the solvent by heating or other suitable means. The substrate to be coated with the magnetic coating material in accordance with the present invention may be the polyethylene terephthalate film that is in wide use as a base material for magnetic recording media. Where heat resistance is an important consideration, a polyimide film, polyamide film or the like may be utilized. In the case of a polyester film as a thin base, it is often used after monoaxial or biaxial orienting. Other applications include coating of paper. The magnetic particles which may be used in the present invention are acicular or granular T Fe203, Fe304, Co doped r Fe203, Co doped Fe203 Fe304 solid solution, Co b ase compound adsorbed r Fe203, and Co base compoundadsorbed Fe304 including those oxidized to an intermediate state between itself and X Fe2033. The term Co base compound as used herein means cobalt oxide, cobalt ilydroxide, cobalt ferrite, cobalt ion adsorbates and the like which enable the magnetic powder to take a vantage of the magnetic anisotropy of cobalt in improving its coercive force. Also, the magnetic powder consisting essentially of a ferromagnetic metal element or alloy, such as Co, Fe Co, Fe Co NX Co Ni, or the like may be suitably employed. Such a fine magnetic powder is prepared in a number of ways, including wet reduction of the starting material with a reducing agent such as NaBH4, a treatment of the iron oxide surface with a Si compound and subsequent dry reduction with H2 gas or the like, and vacuum evaporation in a low pressure argon gas stream. Fine particles of monocrystalline barium ferrite may be employed as well.The fine magnetic powder is used in the form of acicular or granular particles, depending on the application of the resulting magnetic recording medium. In the field of high bias hi fi sound cassette tapes, video cassette tapes, video tapes, master tapes for contact transfer printing and the like, the technical progress in recent years has been striking, and the market is fast growing. As a new addition to this field, a high performance tape possessing both extremely desirable electromagnetic conversion characteristics and physical reliability has now been provided, in accordance with the present invention, by combining a radiation curable binder with a fine magnetic powder, especially a cobalt modified acicular iron oxide cobalt doped or Co base compoundcoated type advantageous for high density recording or on with acicular fine alloy particles having even greater coercive force. For the magnetic coating material of the invention, it is advisable to use various additives usually employed for these applications, such as an antistatic agent, lubricant, dispersant, sensitizer, leveling agent, wearresisting agent, and film reinforcing agent, to suit the particular end use. The radioactive rays for use in cross linking and curing of the magnetic coating film according to the invention may be electron beams from an electron beam accelerator as the source, gamma rays from Cobalt 60,X rays from an X ray generator. The use of electron beam from an electron beam accelerator is particularly advantageous in view of the ease of controling the absorbed dose, introduction into the process line, shield from the ionizing radiation, etc. With regard to the characteristics of electron beams for use in curing the magnetic coating film, it is desirable from the standpoint of transmissivity to adopt an electron beam accelerator which operates with an acceleration voltage of 100 750 KV, preferably 150 300 KV, and effect the irradiation so that the absorbed dose may be in the range of 0.2 20 megarads. In the case of a magnetic tape, in particular, the film of coating to be cured is thin, and therefore the adoption of the low dosage electron beam accelerator made by Energy Science Tnc. of the U.S. Electro curtain system or the equivalent is extremely advantageous because of the ease with which the accelerator can be installed on the tape coating line and the shield can be established against secondary X rays inside the apparatus. Of course, the Van de Graff accelerator in extensive use as an electron beam accelerator may be employed instead. In radiation curing, exposure of the magnetic coating film to radiation in a stream of N2, He, or other inert gas is important. A film of magnetic coating, which is very thickly filled witha magnetic pigment, is highly porous in structure. When it is exposed to electron beamsin air, 03 and the like produced by the irradiation for the cross linking of the binder components will have an adverse effect, keeping the radicals formed in the polymer from effectively acting or the crosslinking reaction. The adverse effect is exercised not merely on the surface of the magnetic coating layer but also deep into the porous film, thus hampering the cross linking of the binder. For this reason it is essential to maintain an inert gas atmosphere of N2, He, C02, or the like around the portion to be irradiated.

The resultant is placed into the ball mill where the magnetic powder has been treated in advance, and the two are again dispersed for 42 hours. After the dispersion, 5 parts by weight, on solids basis of an isocyanate compound ,Desmodur L11 made byBayer AG capable of cross linking by a reaction with the functional groups composed mostly of the hydroxyl groups of the binder in the magnetic coating material is added to the coating composition already charged in the ball mill, and the mixture is kneaded for 20 minutes. The magnetic coating material thus obtained was applied to a 15 thick polyester film, magnetically oriented on a 1600 gauss permanent magnet, and the solvent was dried away by an infrared lamp or hot air. The coating surface was smoothened and the film roll was held in an oven at 800C for 48 hours to promote the cross linking reaction with the isocyanate. The resulting tape was slitted into a 1 2 in. wide ribbon as a video tape Specimen FIG. 1 shows changes in the video sensitivity RF sensitivity levels at 4 r Hz of test video tapes with holding time in the course of video tape making, from the application of the magnetic coating material to the surface smoothening of the resulting film at 250C.For the sensitivity measurement, the output at 4 Hz of a video tape just smoothened on the surface immediately after the coating is fixed to be zero decibel, and the subsequent changes in surface processability with time were followed.The video tape recorder employed for the testing purpose was of the ETS type manufactured by Platsushita Electric. In the case of the conventional tape made by a crosslinking reaction with heat of an isocyanate compound, the isocyanate compound added as a curing agent to the coating material will start its reaction with the hydroxyl groups and the like in the binder. After the application and drying of the coating material, the cross linking reaction in the binder proceeds rapidly. As represented by Specimen A, the curing of the coating film progresses due to the cross linking reaction with the lapse of time after the application, and the video sensitivity tends to decline with a decrease in the surface forming ability. On the other hand, with video tapes of the invention,Specimens num 1 and num 2, there occurred no deterioration in video sensitivity due to a decrease of the surface forming ability with the holding time after the application of the magnetic coating material, because the cross linking by the radicals formed by the irradiation with electron beams proceeds after the surface forming. This turned to be unrelated to the pot life of the magnetic coating material before the application, and thus the limitation to the ordinary process of making a tape of the thermosetting type could be eliminated. FIG. 2 is a graph showing the rates of attenuation on still reproduction of signals with respect to the reproduction output, as measured by recording signals on the video tape specimens by a video tape recorder Matsu shita Electric s N7 3120t for open reels conforming to the EIAJ unified standards and then by reproducing the still images with a tension of 200 grams applied on the take up side by a spring balancer As can be seen from the graph, the cross linking of the binder by electron beams gives a coating film of a tough structure and markedly reduces the rate of signal attenuation, regardless of the rigorous abrasive condition with a relative velocity of the magnetic film and the head as high as 11 meters a second. On the other hand,Specimens num 1, A 1, and num A 2 lacked in flexibility of the coating films and showed serious signal attenuations under the severe abrasive condition of 11 m sec. FIG. 3 is a graphic representation of changes in friction of test video tapes with running time. Each tape was held for five days under changing conditions in five cycles, each beginning with a temperature of 100C and a relative humidity of 0 and ending with 600C and 80 .After this period, the specimen was kept still at room temperature for 24 hours. The tape was then put on the same video tape recorder as used for the still reproduction test, a tension analyzer marketed by Japan AutomaticControl Co., Model IVA 500 , was set between the head drum and the pinch roller of the recorder, and the changes in tension on the take up side of the test tape with running time were measured. This test permits evaluation of not only the friction coefficient level of the magnetic film itself of each test tape but also the degree of deterioration of tape running quality due to exudation of the low molecular components from the magnetic film, and stability of the tape against the environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. As is obvious from the graph, the tapes num 1 and num 2 after the cross linking by electron beam radiation exhibited low friction coefficients. truth adequate cross linking of the low molecular elastomer components, there was no exudation to the coating surface, and the tapes showed good running stability regardless of changes in temperature and humidity. The num 1 tape before the electron beam cross linking, by contrast, indicated very poor running stability after the temperature cycles, although the exudation of the low molecular elastomer components to the magnetic coating surface was responsible to some extent. Specimen A was found to be somewhat instable as compared with Specimens 1 and 2, and uniformity of cross linking by electron beam radiation was confirmed.Example 3 A composition consisting of Acicular magnetic powder of Fe alloy major axis 0.3 , minor axis 0.04 , He 1100 Oe ........................ 120 parts Dispersant oleic acid . ............... ............. 2 Solvent methyl ethyl ketone toluene 50 50 100 is mixed by a powerful mixer for 3 hours, so that the fine particles of magnetic alloy are thoroughly wetted with the dispersant.

Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the alloy audio cassette tapes using binders according to the invention When the resins of different molecular weights, i.e., the electron beam sensitive component having a molecular weight of not less than 5000, the electron beam sensitive component having a molecular weight of more than 400 and less than 5000, and the monomer having a molecular weight of less than 400, are blended with the ele ron beam reactive monomer as in the preceding examples, audio tapes of wellbalanced characteristics are obtained. With good affinity of the binder for the alloy magnetic powder, excellent surface forming ability is exhibited after the application, and extremely smooth surface with a high residual magnetic flux density can be obtained. Thus, tapes of very high sensitivity over the MoL ranges from the low frequency of 333 Hz up to the high frequency of 16 KHz were obtained. As zneasures of reliability, the periods of running time the tapes took to begin squealing, the durability of the tapes with reciprocating travels from reel to reel past the head of a car stereo set, and the bonding strength or adhesion of the coatings to the polyester base were determined. It was confirmed that the alloy cassette tapes according to the invention which used the electron beam curable binders comprising the components of varied molecular weights possessed far greater running durability, reliability in adverse environments of high temperature, high humidity, etc., and better adherence to the base than the tapes of comparative examples. On the other hand, when only a monomer having a molecular weight of less than 400 was employed as the binder Specimen B 1 , it was found the binder gives a very smooth surface and high residual magnetic flux density but the resulting tape is inferior in the length of running time up to the tape squealing, reciprocating running durability, and adherence.Example 5 y Fe203 major axis 0.8 , minor axis 0.2 p Hc 300 Oe .......................... 120 parts Carbon black for antistatic use, Mitsubishi Carbon Black MA 600 .... 5 II a A1203 particles 0.5 Ni in particle size .................. 2parts Dispersant sorbitan monooleate 3 tl Solvent methyl ethyl ketone toluene 50 50 100 These components are mixed up by a ball mill for 3 hours, and the magnetic iron oxide is thoroughly wetted with the dispersant.Next, Resin composition e ................... 15 parts on solids basis II It i 15 It Solvent methyl ethyl ketone toluene 50 50 .............. 200 Lubricant fluorine oil, E.I. du Pont de Nemours 11Kritox11 3 II are mixed well and dissolved.

The coating film was cured by irradiation in an N2 gas atmosphere by an Electro curtain type electron beam accelerator at an acceleration voltage of 175 KeV with an electrode current of 15 mA to a total dosage of 2 mrads.

A disk about 65 mm in diameter was blanked out of the resulting roll, and a magnetic disk was obtained asSpecimen SC. Each test disk was set on a recorder reproducer and was driven to run at a speed of about one meter per second in sliding contact with the magnetic head at a pad pressure of 40 g cmê , and the time required for the dropouts to reach a cumulative total of 1000 was measured.

As will be understood from the table, the combined use of the two electron sensitive binder components of different molecular weights, i.e., more than 5000, and more than 400 and less than 5000, makes the resulting magnetic coating film tough and suitable for floppy disks. The tests on the specimen num C using the binder of only one resin having a molecular weight of less than 5000 and more than 400 indicated that the magnetic coating film is so brittle that it is rapidly scraped off by the head.Thus, the specimen on the comparative example was inferior to that of the example according to the invention.Example 6 Y Fe203 major axis 0.8 , minor axis 0.2 p He 350 Oe ....................... 120 parts Carbon black for antistatic use, Mitsubishi Carbon Black MA 600 . 5 a A12O3 powder 0.5 p in particle size ........... 2 Dispersant sorbitan monooleate ... 3 Solvent methyl ethyl ketone toluene 50 50 ... lOO parts These components are mixed up by a ball mill for 3 hours, and the magnetic iron oxide is thoroughly wetted with the dispersant.

Usually, the point where the reproduction output peak voltage has dropped from the initial standard output voltage by more than 25 is judged to be the end of the ticket life. As shown in the graph, the pulse signal peak voltage levels up to the maximum number of repeated passes of 30000 were observed. As indicated in FIG. 4, it was confirmed that the combination of the compound having a molecular weight of not less than 5000 and the compound having a molecular weight of less than 5000 is remarkably helpful in minimizing the drop of the output relative to the frequency of reproduction. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY As described hereinbefore, the magnetic recording medium according to the present invention has effective uses in varied forms, such as cassette tapes, open reel tapes, video tapes, magnetic cards, and magnetic disks.
