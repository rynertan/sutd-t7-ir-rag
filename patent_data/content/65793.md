# Reinforcement structure for reinforced concrete buildings.

## Abstract
A reinforcement structure for reinforced concrete build ings, comprises a servicing portion 17, 24, 26, 32, 33 which can be dismantled and a fixed structural portion 12, 10 which shall remain embedded in the concrete casting and consists of an iron latticework 12 which is also intended to support the servicing portion 17, 24, 26, 32, 33 . The servicing portion comprises spacer elements 17 and side wall elements 24 having stiffening reinforcements 26 and members and elements 22, 23, 33 are provided to releas ably latching the spacer elements 17 and the sidewall elements 24 to the latticework framing 12, 10 . Such a reinforcement structure also makes possible a novel building method.
