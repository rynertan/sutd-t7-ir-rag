# A process for pre curing poly arylene sulfide .

## Abstract
In the pre curing of particulate poly arylene sulfide by contact with an oxygen containing gas in a vessel at a temperature elevated to a range of about 10 to about 70 C below the melt point of the resin, upon reaching the desired level of pre cure, the particulate resin is contacted with water thereby rapidly to reduce the tem perature level below the temperature at which curing occurs.
