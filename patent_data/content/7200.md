# Method and apparatus for controlling the reading of information from an information storage medium.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for controlling the speed of an information storage medium, such as a disc shaped record carrier 11 , relative to a device for recovering information recorded thereon. The disc includes a plurality of substantially parallel information tracks 15 arranged in a spiral or in con centric circles, and information recorded thereon includes a pilot signal having a predetermined frequency. The apparatus includes means 37 for comparing the phase angle of the recovered pilot signal 57 with the phase angle of a locally generated reference signal 33 , to produce an error signal 43 for controlling the angular velocity of a spindle motor 17 that rotates the disc. The pilot signal includes an equal integral number of cycles on each information track, so its phase angle is aligned on adjacent tracks and the apparatus can continue to operate even when the information recovering device is traversing the disc from one track to another or is not critically positioned with respect to an individual information track.
