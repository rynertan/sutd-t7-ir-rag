# Conjugates of adenine 9 beta arabinofuranoside 5 monophosphate with lactosaminated human albumin, a method for their preparation and therapeutically active compositions containing them.

## Abstract
For the preparation of conjugates of adenine 9 beta D arabinofuranoside 5 monophosphate ara AMP with lactosami nated human albumin L HSA aqueous solutions of the two components to be conjugated are reacted in the presence of 1 ethyl 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide, by adjusting the pH in the range from slightly acidic to alkaline and by separating the conjugate obtained. The resulting conjugate, wherein the molar ratio, as determined by spectrophotometry of ara AMP and L HSA varies between 5 and 20, remains soluble after lyophilization even at room temperature and shows biological activity at least equivalent to that of the conjugate as prepared according to the prior art.
