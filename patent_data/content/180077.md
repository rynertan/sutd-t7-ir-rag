## Description
A DATA PROCESSING MACHINE FOR COMPILING COMPUTER PROGRAMSThis invention relates to data processing machines that are used to compile computer programs and produce object code from a source code input.This invention has particular utility in a compiler for a digital computer in which optimization algorithms are used to improve the quality of the code. It could also be used in an assembler, although optimizing assemblers are not common. This invention improves the quality of the object code generated by the compiler or assembler.The invention is applicable to computers that use an accumulator or a set of general registers, and that have one or more instruction types that exist in two or more forms, with the forms differing in the length of the operands. Furthermore, for this invention to be applicable there must be some reason to prefer a shorter form on an instruction, when it can be used. On many machines, the shorter forms are preferable because they execute faster, or they occupy less storage, or both.The quality of code produced by compilers has been an issue ever since the first compiler was produced. One of the principal objectives ofIBM s FORTRAN I compiler, the first commercially available compiler, was to produce object code in the field of scientific computations which was comparable in code quality to that produced directly by assembly language programmers coding by hand .Today, higher level languages are designed to be used in every field in which computers are applicable. Even the original FORTRAN language has been bolstered to make it applicable to a wide range of programming tasks. However, it is still important that the quality of code produced by the compiler be high, especially if the resultant code is to be used in a production environment. Code produced by a skilled assembly language programmer is still the yardstick against which compiler produced code is measured.A large number of optimization technique have been developed and refined since the 1950 s to improve the quality of compiler generated code.Indeed, many of these optimizations where known in principle, and used in some fashion by the team that produced the first FORTRAN compiler.Optimizations that are frequently employed in optimizing compilers can be divided into two classes, which are commonly known as global and peephole optimizations. Global optimizations are those that are based on an analysis of the entire program being complied. Examples are code motion moving code out of loops and common subexpressions elimination. Peephole optimizations are those that are based on an analysis of a relatively small region of the program, such as a basic block , or perhaps only two adjacent instructions.The present invention can be implemented as a global optimization, or at the basic block level, or it can use partial global information that is normally readily available from global analysis, and then refine this information at the basic block level. With more information available, it is more effective. The information from global analysis that it can profitably use is that of live dead information. This information tells, for each register operand of an instruction, whether or not that register can be used again before it is reloaded with a new quantity.If a register operand of an instruction is dead , that means that the instruction is the last use of the register, and after executing the instruction the contents of the register could be altered in any way without affecting the execution of the program. If a register operand of an instruction is live , on the other hand, that means that the contents of the register cannot be altered after execution of the instruction, because there may be an execution path in which the register s contents are used again. The following references discuss live variable analysis J D Ullman, A Survey of Data Flow Analysis Techniques, Second USA JapanComputer Conference Proceedings, AFIPS Press, Montvale, New Jersey, 1975 , pp 335 342 contains 37 references .A V Aho and J D Ullman, Principles of Compiler Design, Addison Wesley, 1977 .M S Hecht, Flow Analysis of Computer Programs, Elsevier North Holland,New York, 1977 .The Motorola MC68000 is an example of a type of computer to which this invention is applicable. This computer has three forms of add , and three forms of add immediate, as illustrated below. ADD.L rl,r2 ADDI.L 123,rl ADD.W rl,r2 ADDI.W 123,rl ADD.B rl,r2 ADDI.B 123,rl ADD.L add long adds the entire 32 bit contents of register rl to register r2, and places the result in r2. ADD.W add word adds the rightmost 16 bits of rl to the rightmost 16 bits of r2, leaving the leftmost 16 bits of r2 unchanged. ADD.B add byte adds the rightmost eight bits of rl to the rightmost eight bits of r2, leaving the leftmost 24 bits of r2 unchanged. Similarly, ADDI L add immediate long adds a number 123 is shown to the entire 32 bit contents of register rl,ADDI.W adds to the rightmost 16 bits, and ADDI.B adds to the rightmost eight bits.The instructions ADD.W and ADD.B execute faster than ADD.L, and hence are preferred in a situation in which either would do. The instructionsADDI W and ADDI.B execute faster and occupy less storage than ADDI L, and hence are preferred to ADDI L. The Motorola MC68000 has many other instruction types that exist in long and short forms, with the shorter form being faster in execution and often occupying less storage. Further details, including instruction timings, may be found in MC68000 16 bit Microprocessor User s Manual, Second edition, Motorola,Inc., January 1980 .According to the invention there is provided a data processing machine for compiling a computer program in which a particular operation may be controlled by instructions of different lengths characterised in that the machine is controlled to perform the following operation for each input computer program to be compiled 1. defining a self contained sequence of instructions, 2. reversing the order of the sequence, 3. for each instructions that may have a different length, in turn determining the maximum register bit positions required to store the significant digits of the output that would result from executing this instruction. 4. marking the instruction to indicate this maximum length 5. replacing in the sequence any instruction found to require less register lengths than originally defined with an instruction of the appropriate definition.As an example of the code improvement accomplished by this invention, suppose a compiler has generated the instruction sequence ADD.L R2,R1 SUBI L num 16,rl MOVE.W rl,6 r5 and suppose further that the MOVE.W instruction, which stores the rightmost 16 bits of register rl into storage at a location addressed by the contents of register r5 plus 6, is the last use of register rl.Then this invention will replace the ADD.L instruction with ADD.W, and the SUBI.L instruction with SUBI.W. The latter forms execute faster than the former, and the SUBI.W instruction occupies less storage thanSUBI.L.In order that the invention may be fully understood a preferred embodiment thereof will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which FIG. 1 is a very high level functional flowchart of an optimizing compiler in which the present invention has particular utility.FIG. 2 is a high level flowchart of the herein disclosed compiler module for effecting the desired significant bit analysis.FIG. 3 is a more detailed flowchart illustrating how some of the computational type of instructions are processed by the herein disclosed compiler module.The invention will be described as if fits into an optimizing compiler, and for the Motorola MC68000 target machine.The first step in applying this invention is to do significant bit analysis of the program being compiled. This is a process of determining, for each instruction, which bits of the result of that instruction are significant it is assumed, for simplicity, that there is only one result . A bit is significant if it is used by the program after being computed. This is the same concept as the well known liveness, except that each bit of the result is examined to determined whether or not it is live, or significant . In conventional liveness analysis, only a single summary bit is computed for each instruction, which indicates whether or not any bits of the result are live , or significant .There are three levels at which significance analysis could be done 1. Globally, as ordinary liveness analysis is done, 2. On a basic block actually branch to branch level, with assistance from global liveness analysis, or 3. On a basic block or branch to branch level with no assistance.The first choice above is the most expensive to compute but gives the best results. The last is the cheapest to compute but gives the poorest results. The second is a compromise that is only a little more expensive to compute than 3 if liveness analysis has been done anyway, and gives results of intermediate quality. Choice 2 will be described herein, however the invention is not intended to be limited to this particular approach.FIG. 1 shows where level 2 of significant bit analysis block 5 is most conveniently done within the framework of a typical optimizing compiler. The important thing is that global code optimization block 3 is done before significant bit analysis. This is because conventional liveness analysis is part of global code optimization, and we will need the last use bits that are a byproduct of liveness analysis.It is preferable, although not necessary, that register allocation block 4 be done before significant bit analysis. This permits a more efficient compiler, because if register allocation is done first, significant bit analysis can be done in terms of the real registers of the machine, and there is usually a fairly small number of them e.g., 16 on the Motorola MC68000 . Significant bit analysis has to be done before final code generation block 6 . The final code generation module of the compiler will use the results of significant bit analysis to determine what form 8 , 16 , or 32 bit of each instruction to generate.FIG. 2 is a high level flowchart of the significant bit analysis shown in block 5 of FIG. 1. The analysis is done in a single backwards pass over the program. Although the processing shown here could be done on a basic block basis, it is shown being done on a branch to branch basis.This is just as easy to program, and it will sometimes result in better quality code being generated. Thus label points in the program are ignored block 23 . However, branch instructions block 25 result in resetting the machine s knowledge of which bits are significant in each register, to the state all bits of all registers are presumed to be significant. This is the safe state to assume of those pints at which the machine has no information.If an instruction is not one that represents a label point, and is not a branch or subroutine return instruction, then it is an ordinary computational instruction such as add, load, store, shift, etc.The processing of computational instructions, shown as block 26 of FIG.2, is shown in more detail in FIG. 3.This program works with an array of bits referred to herein as the significant bit table SBT , that has a number of rows equal to the number of registers on the machine e.g., 16 on the Motorola MC68000 , and a number of columns equal to the register length of the machine 32 on the MC68000 . At a typical point in processing, the array might look like this 32 bits 0. OOOOFFFF 8. FFFFFFFF 1. FFFFFFFF 9. 0000FFFF 2. FFFFFFFF 10. 000001FF 3. FFFFFFFF 11. 7FFFFFFF 4. FFFFFFF0 12. OFOFOFOF 5. 000000FF 13. 0000FF00 6. FFFFFFFF 14. FFFFFFFF 7. FFFFFFFF 15. FFFFFFFFHere we have shown the bits in hexadecimal notation, e.g., OOOOFFFF , denotes 16 zero bits followed by 16 one bits.The values in the array change as the program scans backwards in the instruction stream. If, at a certain point, the array has the values shown above, then the meaning is that at that point, the leftmost 16 bits of register 0 are not significant dead , but the rightmost 16 bits are significant. A value of FFFFFFFF means that all bits in the associated register are significant, etc.Now, with reference to FIG. 3, let us see how an instruction is processed to determine the significant bits of its result. The process is to propagate the significant bits from a result to the input operands of an instruction. Then, it is propagated from the input operands of a current instruction to the result operands of earlier instructions, as the program controls the processor to scan backwards through the instruction stream. Just how the bits propagate from a result to the input operands depends on the instruction type add, shift, store, etc. , as shown in FIG. 3. To get started, the machine must know, or assume, which bits of the result of the first encountered instruction are significant. For the process being described, the first encountered instruction is assumed to have all its result bits significant. This is recorded by initializing the entire 16x32 bit array to all one s when a branch instruction is encountered. Now, suppose the middle of a branch to branch section of code is being currently processed, and an add or substrate or subtract instruction is encountered. In particular, suppose the instruction is ADD.L rl,r2This means to add the contents of register rl to the contents of register r2. Register r2 is both an input to and the result of the instruction. It will be easier for us to think in terms of a three address instruction ADD.L Rl,r2,3 in which r3 is the result registerFirst it is necessary to refer to the significant bit table at position r3, to see what bits of the result are significant. The bit mask retrieved from the table is associated stored with the add instruction, so that it can be used later by the assembly and final code generation module to generate the optimum form of the add instruction.Actually, for efficiency it suffices to associate only two bits with the add instruction, to record whether the instruction should be generated in long 32 bit form, word 16 bit form, or byte 8 bit form, as those are the only choices on the MC68000. This association of two bits with the instruction will be referred to subsequently as marking the instruction.Suppose the significant bits of the result register r3 as determined for the SBT are X7000080l21. Then we can mark the add instruction as word, or 16 bit, form, because all significant bits of the result lie in the rightmost 16 bits of register r3. Then, since addition is a right to left process two s complement arithmetic is assumed throughout , the bits in the leftmost 16 positions of registers rl and r2 cannot possibly affect a significant bit of the result, but bits anywhere in the rightmost 16 positions can. Therefore, the significant bits of registers rl and r2 for this instruction are X 0000FFFF . This is next recorded in the SBT table, at the rows for registers rl and r2.If the add instruction is the last use of rl or r2 in that block, then the table position for rl or r2 is set to X 0000FFFF . This is determined by looking at the liveness bit described above which may be set during the Code Optimization phase. On the other hand, if the add instruction is not the last use of rl or r2 , then we OR X 0000FFFF into the table at position rl or r2 . The point is that rl and r2 may have certain bits significant because of uses of these registers below the add instruction, e.e., uses that were processed earlier in this backwards scan, and wherein those significant uses must not be forgotten . This processing of an add or subtract instructMon is shown in blocks 31 and 32 of FIG. 3.As the backwards scan proceeds, it will likely come to an instruction that sets rl to r2. At this point, it refers to the table at position rl or r2, respectively, to determine which bits of that register are significant. It then propagates this information back to the input operands, in a manner similar to the processing of the add instruction described above.Suppose as another example that a store byte instruction is encountered FIG. 3 blocks 39 and 40 . This instruction would be written MOVE.B rl,d r2,r3 in which register rl contains the byte being stored, and r2 and r3 are base and index registers that serve to address storage. d is a displacement a constant that has no role in significance analysis.The MOVE instruction has no result register it doesn t alter the contents of any register . It uses only the rightmost eight bits of register rl. Therefore, a mask of X OOOOOOFF is OR ed into the table at the position of rl. The MOVE instruction uses the rightmost 24 bits of the base and index registers, so a mask of X OOFFFFFF is OR ed into the table at the positions of r2 and r3.FIG. 3 shows the processing of six instruction types. The complete process should be expanded to include other instruction types not shown in FIG. 3, such as load and shift instructions, etc.To now present a more substantial example, suppose that a sequence of code between branches is significance of rl MOVE.L 4 r2 ,r1 0000OFF00 LSR.L num 8,rl 000000FF ANDI.L X 000000FF ,rl 000000FF MOVE.B rl ,O r2 The program reads a long word 32 bits from memory, shifts it right eight positions LSR logical shift right , AND s it with the maskX OOOOOOFF , and stores the rightmost byte of register rl into main memory. The column headed significance of rl shows one row of the significance array, that for rl, as processing proceeds backwards. The following will describe what happens to the significance of rl as this sequence of instructions is processed.Initially bottom row , the significance of rl is set to X FFFFFFFF , which is what has to be assumed in the absence of any knowledge. Then the MOVE.B instruction is encountered. For this example, assume that the use of rl in this instruction is flagged as a last use, which has been denoted with a prime after rl. Then the significance of rl is set to X OOOOOOFF in the table, following FIG. 3 block 40.Next the ANDI.L is encountered. This instruction uses rl as both an input and the result register. The significance of rl as a result,X OOOOOOFF , is AND d with the mask, also X OOOOOOFF is OR ed into the table for position rl. The result is X OOOOOOFF no change to the significance of rl . These steps are summarized in FIG. 3 block 42.Now at this point, the significance analysis program could observe that the NAD instruction turns off only insignificant bits, and hence can be omitted. Alternatively, the instruction could be marked as byte form, and final code generation could delete it, since the immediate mask ends in eight 1 bits.Next the LSR.L is encountered. It is marked as byte form, because the significance of the result is X OOOOOOFF . The significance of the input register, rl, is the significance of the result register, also rl, shifted left eight positions handling of shifts is not shown in FIG.3 .Lastly, the MOVE.L is encountered. This is marked as word 16 bit form, because the significance of the result register rl isX OOOOFF00 , i.e., only bits in the rightmost 16 positions are significant. By using the marking computed above, final code generation can output the following instructions as a faster and shorter equivalent to those shown above MOVE.W 6 r2 ,rl load instruction from memory LSR.W num 8,rl MOVE.B rl ,O r2 store instruction to memory There are two things that final code generation must be cognizant of that arise in the above example 1 the MOVE.L cannot be changed toMOVE.W unless the increase of two in the displacement from 4 to 6 in the example results in a displacement within the limits allowed by the instruction 32767 for the MC68000 , and 2 the selection for the most efficient form of the LSR instruction depends upon the significance of the result and the shift amount.In the example, the significance of the result is X OOOOOOFF , but the LSR instruction cannot be made LSR.B, because bits in positions 16 23 of register rl are shifted into positions 24.31. It can, however, be made LSR.W, which is faster than the original LSR.L.Appendix I shows a complete working subroutine for performing significance analysis. It includes the steps that were illustrated inFIG. 2 and FIG. 3. It has been utilized successfully with several target machines the Motorola MC68000, the IBM System 370, and several experimental reduced instruction set machine architectures. It is written in a language similar to PL I, and is sufficiently annotated to allow any skilled programmer to incorporate the present invention into an optimizing compiler of the form shown in FIG. 2, or to rewrite the subroutine in another language, or for another target machine, or for a compiler to assembly of different structure. It will of course be appreciated that the specific significance values introduced into the bit table would have to be tailored to a specific system architecture and particular instruction format. The invention would have equal applicability to, for example, a 16 bit full word machine as well as to a 45 to 64 bit machine architecture. It should be noted more particularly, that the advantages of the present invention will be realized in a machine architecture where the shorter form instructions take less machine time or less storage space than the longer form regardless of the underlying and length of the machine.
