These processes are of special interest and are described below in Schemes I VII Scheme I illustrated by Example 2 EMI17.1 Scheme II illustrated by Examples 11 13 for VIIa Example 14 for II EMI18.1 EMI18.2 EMI18.3 R2 is hydrogen, loweralkyl, halo or loweralkoxy R and R1 are as defined previously andR3 is loweralkyl or other protecting groups for acid function. According to Scheme II there are four essential steps A 4 R1 l,5 di alkoxycarbonyl pyrrole of formula VIla wherein R3 is loweralkyl as previously defined or other protecting groups for carboxylic acids is halogenated with N bromosuccinimide or other suitable halogenating agents in an inert solvent which may be selected from chlorinated hydrocarbons such as carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride, chloroform, or hydrocarbons such as benzene or cyclohexane. The halogenation may be carried out at a temperature from about OOC to about l000C, preferably at 20 to 800C or the boiling point of the solvent and may be catalyzed by light or a standard free radical catalyst, such as dibenzoyl peroxide.The time of reaction is not critical and the reaction is usually carried out until it is substantially complete. The 4 halomethyl intermediate is subsequently isolated and treated with a phenoxide or thiophenolate of formulaEMI19.1 wherein R, n and Y are as previously defined and M is an alkali metal cation, for example Na , K or Li B The resulting 4 R n C6H5 n y cH2 derivative, IV , is converted to the diacid V via conventional procedures, for example hydrolysis in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide. C The resultant diacid V is treated with a condensing agent, for example, trifluoroacetic anhydride TFAA , with or without trifluoro acetic acid TFA or suitable Lewis acid aluminum chloride, stannic chloride, etc. to give the ring closed product, i.e., tricyclic benzoxepino or benzthiapino 4,3 b pyrrole carboxylic acid VI . The reaction may be carried out with or without a solvent such as methylene chloride, l,2 dichloroethane, excess TFA, etc. Alternately, standard Friedel Crafts conditions may be used to effect the closure, such as a suitable Lewis acid on the corres ponding acid chloride, or the closure may be carried out using a polyphosphoric acid or equivalent type system.In general, the use of TFAA with TFA or aluminum chloride is preferred, the reaction conducted under mild conditions at temperatures as low as 200C to 700C, preferably at about OOC to 350C. D The resultant tricyclic compound VI is converted by Arndt Eistert reaction See Org. Reactions, I, Chap. 2, p. 53 or other known, classical, sequences for chain extension of carboxylic acids, generally through condensa tion or substitution reactions of the corres ponding acid chlorides, aldehydes or alcohols or derivatives thereof to compounds of formula II . According to the Arndt Eistert procedure, the tricyclic carboxylic acid VI is converted by way of its chloride into diazoketones which in turn rearrange to the homologous carboxylic acid II according to Step E . The reagent used for diazoketone formation is usually a diazoalkane, e.g., diazomethane freshly generated from N methyl N nitrosourea, etc. , or diazoethane. After the diazoketone of VI is formed, it is decomposed, in the presence of a finely divided salt of silver, copper, or platinum, in water or in an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol. When the above decomposition is conducted in water, it leads to a homologous acid. However, when an alcohol is used instead of water, an ester of the homologous acid is formed first which is then hydrolyzed to the acid of formula II according to step E . Sometimes, it may be desirable to decompose the diazoalkane in ammonia or an amine to prepare first the amide of the homologous acid and then hydrolyze this product to the acid. Alternatively, the decomposition may be carried out in a high boiling alcohol such as benzyl alcohol in the presence of collidine or other strong organic bases. The preferred embodiment of this step is to treat compound VI with thionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride or the like to form the corresponding acid chloride. The chlorination is usually carried out in an anhydrous inert solvent, e.g., methylene chloride sometimes containing a trace of N,N dimethylformamide at about 100C to about 750C, preferably at ambient temperatures until the reaction is substantially complete. The crude acid chloride is then treated with freshly prepared diazomethane or diazoethane at low temperatures, preferably at about 50C to about 250C until starting material has been converted to diazoketone. The resultant diazo compound is subsequently treated with an excess of anhydrous methanol or ethanol containing silver oxide and or silver nitrate.Generally, the rearrangement requires mild heating, i.e., heating at from about 350C to about 1000C, preferably at reflux of the reaction mixture. Under optimum conditions, the above chlorination diazoketone formation rearrangement sequence may be completed in about 5 to about 72 hours. Scheme III illustrated by Example 11 for VII Example 15 for II EMI23.1 EMI23.2 EMI23.3 EMI23.4 According to Scheme III the alternative process comprises four steps A a 4 R1 pyrrole 2 carboxylic acid ester . VII is treated with a 2 YCH3 benzoyl halide of formulaEMI24.1 under Friedel Craft reaction conditions well known in the art. For example, mixing the substrates and a catalyst such as All3, CF3SO3H, or other commonly used Lewis acid in an inert solvent such as dichloroethane and nitromethane or a mixture thereof at about 300C or at ambient temperatures, preferably at about 100C to about 150C until the acylation is substantially complete. The reaction usually takes about 1 to about 48 hours. Under optimum conditions it may only require about 1 10 hours. B The resultant 5 benzoyl derivative VII I from step A is halogenated as described previously followed by cleavage of the YCH3 group to afford compound IX . The cleavage may be carried out by first treating the methoxy compound VIII with a strong Lewis acid, e.g., boron tribromide, followed by treatment with water. C The resultant YH derivative IX from Step B is treated with a strong base, for example, sodium hydride in DMF or other commonly used inert aprotic solvent, to form the nucleophilic phenolate anion which in turn displaces the bromo group of the 4 bromomethyl function attached to the pyrrole ring. This intramolecular cyclization is usually carried out under low temperatures from about 500C to about 500C, preferably from about 200C to about 200C. The reaction time is not critical as the reaction is usually monitored by analytical methods such as thin layer chromato graphy until it is substantially complete. D The tricyclic compound X resulting from Step c is hydrolyzed and then converted to the desired compounds of formula II via the Arndt Eistert or alternative reactions as described previously. The starting materials of the processes, e.g., VIIa and VII , are readily obtained from commercially available materials, e.g., l methyl pyrrole 2 carboxylic acid, glycine ethyl ester hydrochloride, acetone, and diethyl oxalate, as shown below in the followng schemes EMI26.1 EMI26.2 EMI26.3 The reaction sequences represented above are self explanatory and are especially useful for intermediate VII. The preferred reaction sequence described in route b is a much shorter and efficient method for preparing the starting materialIII. The condensation of a amino ketones and n diketones in aqueous sodium hydroxide for 5 days to give 3 methyl 5 carbethoxypyrrole 2 carboxylic acid has been reported by H. Kondo et al., in J. Pharm.Soc. Japan, 57, 1 5 1937 C. A. 31, 103b and 7055 1937 . However, when the same procedure was applied to a aminoester of route b , only a trace amount of diethyl 3 methyl pyrrole 2,5 dicarboxylate was obtained. By the modified procedure of this invention, the condensation is carried out in two stages 1 with a weak base suspended in a refluxing, inert aprotic solvent, e.g., benzene, toluene and xylene, the weak base may be sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate or the like and 2 with an alkali metal such as sodium or lithium in a loweralkanol especially C16 alkanol, for example, methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol and t butyl alcohol. The two stage condensation is usually performed in one pot without isolation of intermediates. The yield of this improved procedure ranges from about 50 55 on molar basis.

Scheme VII Illustrated by Example 19 EMI31.1 Note Et may also be other loweralkyl groups. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the acids of Formula I are readily prepared by conventional procedures well known in the art. For example, an acid of formula I is treated with an appropriate amount of a base, such as an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium. hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, or an organic base such as an amine, e.g., dibenzylethylenediamine, trimethiamine piperdine, pyrrolidine, benzylamine and the like.

It is washed with ether and then acidified with 2N hydrochloric acid to give I . Conversion of L to I may also be accomplished by other procedures well known in the art, for example, the oxidative cleavage of the corresponding enol by lead tetraacetrate, permanganate or similar reagents or by an enzymatic procedure. EXAMPLE 42 The conversion of 1,7 dimethyl 4,10 dihydro 10 oXo lH l benzoxepinol4,3 b pyrrole 2 yl methanol to I is accomplished by a variety of methods, including the stepwise conversion to the corresponding 2 halomethyl compound, the corresponding acetonitrile, followed by hydrolysis see Example 48 formation of the grignard reagent of the 2 halomethyl compound followed by treatment with carbon dioxide see Example 43 direct carbonation with carbon monoxide in presence of a rhodium catalyst Chem.

After an additional 3 4 hours, the mixture is added slowly to ice water 800 ml with stirring and the resulting precipitate collected by filtration. Subsequently the precipitated cyano compound is hydrolyzed with aqueous ethanolic sodium hydroxide to afford I as described in Example 48.

It is stirred for about 10 minutes before it is filtered and concentrated in vacuo to a residue. Chromatography on silica gel using methylene chloride as eluant yields the ethyl ester of I which in turn is hydrolyzed in the usual manner to afford I . Alternatively, N is converted to I via reaction with ethyl oxalylchloride under FriedelCrafts conditions followed by reduction of the resulting a keto group and subsequent hydrolysis, of the ethyl ester. Furthermore, treatment of N with maleic acid in the presence of boron trifluoride followed by decarboxylation yields 1,7 dimethyl 4,10 dihydro l0 oXo lH l benzoxepinof4,3 b pyrrole 2 methyl acetic acid.

Conversion of the starting ethynl compound may also be accomplished by other methods well known in the art, e.g., by the procedure of McDonald andSchwab, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 86 1964 4866, or by the procedure in Annales de Chimie 16 1931 309. It has been found that the compounds ofFormula I possess anti inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic activities. Particularly they are effective in the prevention and inhibition of edema and granuloma tissue formation as shown by the phlogistically induced rat foot edema assay. More specifically the compounds of the present invention are useful for reducing inflammation and relieving pain in a variety of diseases, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout, infectious arthritis and rheumatic fever. At similar dosage levels, they are as effective as zomepirac type compounds known in the art but exhihit a lower incidence of side effects. The rat foot edema assay for determining anti inflammatory activity is based on the ability of the compounds of Formula I to inhibit the oedema induced by the injection of an inflammatory phlogistic agent into the tissues of the foot of a rat. Several groups of six male rats Sprague Dawley strain, 150 30 g each are given orally the compounds to be tested one hour before 0.1 ml of a 1 suspension of carragenin in 0.58 methocel is injected into the plantar surface of each rat s right hind paws. Immediately and again three hours later, the foot volume is measured and recorded. The difference between the initial and final volumes is a measurement of the edema produced.Usually the compounds to be tested are suspended or dissolved in 0.5 methocel, and their activities measured against that produced by a known anti inflammatory agent e.g., zomepirac U.S. Patent 3,952,012 according to standard procedure. The activity of a tested compound is also compared with that produced by a control rat which receives only the methocel solution. A test of 3 mg kg, 10 mg kg plus one dose of 30 mg kg are usually given.

The active compounds of Formula I and the pharmaceutical compositions thereof are found to be superior than Zomepirac and related analgesic antiinflammatory agents in the Gastric Hemorrhage LesionFormation Assay GHLF . In other words, they induce less gastric irritation than Zompirac. The GHLF test is conducted according to the following procedure Rats Sprague Dawley, Males, 120 180 gm are fasted overnight and dosed orally with drug suspended in 0.5 methylcellulose. The drug concentration is adjusted so that each animal received 1.0 ml 100 gm body weight. Four hours later the animals are killed by asphixiation in carbon dioxide, the stomachs removed, cut open and everted. The mucosal lining is washed and examined under 3X magnification.The lesions are identified as perforations of the gastric mucosa, many of which perforate right through the wall of the stomach. The results are expressed in two ways, the average number of lesions per stomach, and the number of animals in the group showing at least one lesion.

The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide a pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparation. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets.These excipients may be for example, inert diluents such as calcium carbonate sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate granulating and disintergrating agents, for example, maize starch, or alginic acid binding agents, for example starch, gelatine or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatine capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatine capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil., liquid paraffin, or olive oil. Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The said aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example thyl, or n propyl, p hydroxy benzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin. Oily suspension may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such a those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid. Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspensin by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives.Suitable dispersing or wetting and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above.Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil in water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oils, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally occurrng phosphatides, for example soya bean lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan mono oleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono oleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, sorbitol or sucorse. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for example as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3 butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution.In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. The compounds of this invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions, or suspensions, etc., containing the anti inflammatory agents are employed. Dosage levels of the order to 0.2 mg to 140 mg per kilogram of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above indicated conditions 10 mg to.7 gms per patient per day . For example, inflammation is effectively treated and anti pyretic and analygesic activity manifested by the administration from about 0.5 to 50 mg of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day 25 mg to 3.5 gms per patient per day . Advantageously, from about 2 mg to about 20 mg per kilogram of body weight per daily dosage produces highly effective results 100 mg to 4 gm per patient per day . The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended for the oral administration of humans may contain from 5 mg to 5 gm of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 25 mg to about 500 mg of active ingredient. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.
