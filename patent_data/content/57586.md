# Raster output scanner and method.

## Abstract
A raster output scanner and scanning method are described. The scanner has a movable imaging member 25 and high intensity imaging beam 11 for exposing the imaging member to create images thereon. A rotating poly gon 18 scans the beam across the imaging member in line by line fashion while a modulator 14 astride the beam path modulates the beam in accordance with image signals or pixels input thereto. A clock 49 provides clock pulses for clocking the image pixels to the modulator. To assure uniform image size despite variations in the velocity of the imaging member 25 a control signal re presentative of imaging member velocity is used to control polygon velocity and maintain a predetermined velocity relationship between imaging member 25 and polygon 11 . Means 57 are provided to servo clock frequency with polygon rotation, with a control 115 to shift the clock servo midpoint frequency in response to changes in imaging member velocity.
