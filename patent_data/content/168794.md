# Optically stabilized camera lens system.

## Abstract
An optically stabilized camera lens system includes an objective lens 8 mounted to the lens case and an optical train defining an optical path between the objective lens 8 and a camera image plane 120 . The optical train includes first a Humphrey prism 18 , second a light reversing, cube corner element third a zoom lens 102 . Provision is made for replace ment of the cube corner with a prism 101 and use of a parity inverting prism 112 such as a Dove or preferably a Pechan to provide an alternate path. Roll stabilization is provided by coupling the Pechan, Dove or equivalent parity reversing prism 112 to a gyroscope 106 so the prism becomes a derotating prism. The derotating prism rotates about the optical path at half the speed the case rotates about the optical axis to pro duce roll stabilization preferred in camera and video applica tions. The Humphrey prism 18 is inertially mounted to the case 6 , using a stabilizer to compensate for small accidental tilt and pan motions of the case.
