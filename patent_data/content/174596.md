# Device for collecting commodities.

## Abstract
Commodities 2 such as containers for milk or juice, which are successively supplied on a conveyor 1 , are pushed off sideways from the conveyor 1 to be accumu lated as an array A and this array A is then further discharged towards a station for wrapping groups of com modities 2 to form marketing units. In order to minimize the effect of time losses required for the reciprotating movement of the pushing devices 4, 7 said array A is formed with a number of commodities 2 which is at least twice the number of commodities 2 contained in a final marketing unit, and said array A is then divided into smaller arrays A1, A2 corresponding to said units.
