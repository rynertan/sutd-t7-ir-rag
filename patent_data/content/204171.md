# Cross linked optical siloxane polymer.

## Abstract
A cross linked optical siloxane polymer having a group for modifying a refractive index of the polymer which is introduced in a side chain of the polymer by a hydrosilyl reaction of one of following systems 1 a compound A having a carbon carbon unsaturated bond and a group for modifying a refractive index, and a siloxane polymer B having a silicon hydride group wherein the molar ratio of the silicon hydride group to the carbon carbon unsaturated bond is more than 1, and 2 a compound A having a silicon hydride group and a group for modifying a refractive index, and a siloxane polymer B having a carbon carbon unsaturated bond wherein the molar ratio of the carbon carbon unsaturated bond to the silicon hydride group is more than 1, the polymer being cross linked by a hydrosilyl reaction of the unreacted silicon hydride groups of the siloxane polymer B with a compound C having at least two carbon carbon unsaturated bond when the system 1 is used, or by a hydrosilyl reaction of the unreacted carbon carbon unsaturated bonds of the siloxane polymer B with a compound C having at least two silicon hydride groups when the system 2 is used, the refractive index of which is easily and precisely modified.
