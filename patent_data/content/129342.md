# ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEM UTILIZING A MEMORY EFFECT MATERIAL

## Abstract
A thermal mechanical energy converting device 10 includes a fixed cylinder 20 , a frame 18 mounted to co axially rotate about the fixed cylinder, at least one wheel 40 rotatably supported on the frame, and endless transmission elements 16 of a material having a memory effect capable in the bending mode of converting thermal energy into mechan ical energy when heated from a temperature below its transi tion temperature to a temperature above its transition temp erature. The transmission elements 16 serve to drive the wheel 40 and the frame 18 about the cylinder 20 upon the application of thermal energy to the transmission elements. This is accomplished by supplying the thermal energy to the cylinder. The thermal energy is transferred from the cylinder to the transmission elements over at least a major portion of the circumferential contact therewith.
