# Coordinate input device with display.

## Abstract
A coordinate input device with display has a position detecting apparatus constituted by a plurality of X direction magnetostrictive transmission mediums 1a 1d and a plural ity of Y direction magnetostrictive transmission mediums superposed orthogonally, a first coil 2 wound round one end of the magnetostrictive transmission mediums and a second coil 5 wound over substantial lengths of the magnetostrictive transmission mediums. The X and Y direction position data for determining the position appointed on the tablet by a position appointing magnetism generator is detected by measuring the time lengths be tween the moment at which a pulse current is applied to one of the first and the second coils and the moments at which the voltages induced in the other of the first and second coils by the magnetostrictive vibration exceeds a threshold value due to drastic increase of voltage observed when the wave passes the appointed position. The coordinate input device further has a display unit which is superposed to the tablet and adapted to display the position appointed on the tablet directly at the corresponding position thereon. The appoint ment of position is made with a high precision by a position appointing magnetism generator 7 from a position on or above the display unit superposed to the tablet, and the thus inputted position is clearly checked visually by the display made on the corresponding positions on the display unit superposed to the tablet. The magnetism generator has no cord for connection to the stationary part of the device, so that the position appointing magnetism generator can be handled easily without hindering the visual check of the inputted position. The position appointing magnetism gener ator need not be positioned in the close proximity of the magnetostrictive transmission mediums but may be spaced therefrom provided that it can apply only a small intensity of the magnetic field to the magnetostrictive transmission mediums. Thus, the invention can be embodied with any kind and thickness of the display if the magnetic field produced by the position appointing magnetism generator can reach the magnetostrictive transmission mediums across the thickness of the display unit.
