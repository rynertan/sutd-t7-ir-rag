# Method and apparatus for biological treatment of waste gases.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for removal of malodorous and or toxic components from wast gases by biological treatment of the same. Such removal is accomplished by passing the gas stream through a humidifying temperature conditioning section 2 and then through a filter bed 3 . The filter bed consists of a mixture of an organic biological active material, like compost, an inert fraction and additives for neutralization and organic buffering. Also disclosed is the inoculation of the filter bed with specific micro organisms adapted to remove constituents of the gas stream which are difficultly biodegradable, e.g. methylenechloride.
