# Method of enhancing flammability resistance of polyparabanic acid films by the addition of copper chelates and films thus formed.

## Abstract
Thin films from 0.025 to 0.127 mm thick of poly parabanic acid PPA M form containing halogenate flame retardants have the flame retardancy enhanced by the addition of small amounts generally about 0.1 to 3.0 weight percent of a copper chelate compound. Copper chelate compounds alone will also enhance the flame retardancy of poly parabanic acid film.
