# Apparatus and method for thermo bonding metallic surfaces.

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for heat bonding surfaces together. A laser beam 21 is applied to the opening 18 in a bonding tip 15 . The bonding tip 15 includes a conically tapered central passage 17 , forming a black body cavity, extending from the opening 18 to an exit bore 16 . The heated tip end around the bore 16 is applied to the fuse able surfaces in either a thermo compression or ther mosonic bonding operation. For the latter operation an ul trasonic generator 20 is coupled to the bonding tip 15 . The bonding tip 15 is heated by absorbing energy from the laser beam.
