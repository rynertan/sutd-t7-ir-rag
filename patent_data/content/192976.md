## Description
COMPOUNDS HAVING ANTIHYPERLIPEMIC ACTIVITY, PROCESSES FORTHE PREPARATION THEREOF AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONSCONTAINING THEM The present invention relates to therapeutically useful compounds as antihyperlipemic agents, a process for the preparation thereof and pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active ingredients. Particularly, the present invention relates to l,lO bisL2 hydroxyethyl thio decane esters with N etaroyl aminoacids e.g. nicotinuronic acid or nicotinoylglycine and analogous having the following formula I EMI1.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, 2 butyl, hydroxymethyl, 1 hydroxy ethyl, carboxymethyl, aminocarbonylmethyl, 2 carboxy ethyl, 2 aminocarbonylethyl, 4 amino butyl, 4 amino 3 hydroxy butyl, 5 imidazolyl methyl, 3 guanidino propyl, benzyl, 4 hydroxy ben zyl, 3 indolyl methyl, 4 hydroxy 3,5 diiodophenoxy 3,5diiodobenzyl, thiomethyl, methylthioethyl or a group of formulaEMI1.2 when R1 is different from hydrogen, the carbon atoms mark ed with an asterisk may be in L, D or DL form B is an etaryl residue selected from the group comprising 3 pyridyl, 5 bromo 3 pyridyl, 5 fluoro 3 pyridyl, pyrazinyl, 5 methyl pyrazinyl and N oxides thereof, 5 methyl pyrazole 3 yl and 5 methyl isoxazole 3 yl. The present invention also relates to pharmaceutically and veterinarily acceptable inorganic and organic acid addition salts of compounds of formula I. Examples of therapeutically acceptable salts are the salts with inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, sulphuric and phosphoric acids, and organic acids, such as methanesulphonic, malic, fumaric and tartaric acids. Compounds I may be used in therapy, in the treatment of atherosclerosis, a multifactorial disease characterized by a decrease in arterial elasticity, thickening and stiffness of arterias and by lesions of great or median arteries with deposit of atheromatous plaques containing cholesterol and lipid materials phospholipids, lipoproteins and cholesterol . Therefore, in patients affected with primary hyperlipemia, i.e. hyperlipemia not resulting from other disturbances, such as lipid nephrosis, diabetes or hypothyroidism, the treatment consists in reducing plasma concentrations of cholesterol, lypoproteins particularly LDL and VLDL and triglycerides, by means of dietary measures, to be advised according to the single case, or, with the progess and aggravation of the disease, in a treatment with hypolipemizing drugs commonly used in therapy. On the other hand, at least five types of hyperlipemia are known, according to Friedrickson s classifica tion, but no drug equally effective on all of the five types of hyperlipemia is hitherto known. Thus, for instance, clofibric acid and its similar compounds are effective against type III, IV and V hyperlipemias, whilst bezafibrate, a compound of the same group of clofibric acid, seems to be useful also in type II hyperlipemia. Bis hydroxyethylthio l,lO decane thiadenol , which is able to block endogenous synthesis of cholesterol at both hepatic and intestinal level, is particularly effective in type II and IV hyperlipemia, but it shows a very low half life time, which involves frequent administrations of the drug. Another thioether, probucol, is particularly useful in the treatment of type II hyperlipemia and all the disturbances involving high cholesterol concentrations. Compounds, such as pantetine disulfide or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaric acid, are useful in the treatment of type IIa and lIb dyslipemias, by interference in the biochemical processes leading to cholesterol synthesis.Other drugs such as cholestyramine and glucurono 2 amino2 deoxyglycane sulfate are used in therapy due to their ability to inhibit respectively cholesterol absorption at the intestinal level and VLDL lipoproteins uptake by the arterial walls, therefore contributing in lowering blood viscosity and platelets adhesivity. Finally, a particularly therapeutically useful group of drugs is that of nicotinic acid and nicotinic like activity compounds, such as nicotinic acid N oxide, 5 bromo and 5 fluoro nicotinic acids, alkyl substituted nicotinic acids pyrazinoic acid, 5 methyl pyrazinoic acid and N oxides thereof 5 methyl pyrazole and 5 methyl isoxazole 3 carboxylic acids and corresponding amides, alcohols, ethers and or thioethers wherein the COOH group is replaced by CONH2, CH2OH, CH2OAlkyl, CH2S Alkyl . These compounds have a different mechanism of action from that of the above mentioned compounds, which mainly consists in an antilipolytic effect, reducing the concentrations of phospholipids VLDL, LDL , free fatty acids, triglycerides and cholesterol in the circulation. Nicotinic acid and similar compounds, in fact, increase cholesterol bile secretion but not that of bile acids. In therapy, nicotinic acid must be administered in high dosages 3 to 6 g a day , which frequently cause marked side effects, such as gastric irritation, pruritus, intense cutaneous flush on face and limbs, and cephalgia. Since nicotinic acid and similar compounds are rapidly excreted, they must be administered in high dosages, to obtain effective concentrations of the drug in the blood, warranting on therapeutic efficacy. Alternatively, nicotinic acid and or similar compounds may be administered in form of amides, ethers or bonded with polymers releasing slowly the active ingre dint, in order to decrease the absorption and excretion rates of the drug, thus improving the therapeutic index of said compounds and prolonging the plasmatic half life, at the same time reducing the above described untoward effects. That seems to be particularly important, because the nicotinic acid, at therapeutically effective blood levels, was shown to exert a profibrinolytic activity. With this respect, US Patent 4,021,436, FR A 2,146,138, FR A 2,324,303, EP A 0053681 andEP A 0060994 describe nicotinic esters or nicotinoyl carbonates of bis hydroxyethylthio 1,lO decane, in order to combine the proved effectiveness of bis hydroxyethylthio l,10 decane in normalizing the impaired lipidic metabolism of atherosclerotic patients, with the peculiar therapeutic characteristics of nicotinic acid, thus attaining a reduction in total lipids particularly those bonded to LDL andVLDL , triglycerides and cholesterol. The known esters of nicotinic acid and bis hydroxy ethylthio l,lO decane should release in vivo the single constituents, by the action of plasmatic esterases, thus increasing and enlarging the therapeutic action of each of them. Particularly for the nicotinic ester of bis hydro xyethylthio l,10 decane, it is reported that the oral administration of the new molecule, in comparison with equal doses of the single compounds, nicotinic acid and bis hydroxyethylthio l,lO decane, allows to obtain better therapeutic indexes as for DL50 values. Moreover it is known that nicotinuric acid nicotinoylglycine , one of the main urinary metabolites of nicotinic acid, is able to lower plasmatic concentrations of cholesterol, when administered orally T.A. Mietirmen,Atherosclerosis, Proceed. Sec. Int. Symp, R.J. Jones Ed.,Springer N.Y., 1970, 508 . Unfortunately nicotinuric acid, though pharmaceutically effective per se, cannot be used in human therapy, due to its lower adsorption than that of nicotinic acid. It has been now surprisingly found that compoundsI, according to the invention, besides having a high hypolipemizing activity and negligible side effects, are effectively absorbed by the oral route, attaining long lasting therapeutically effective hematic concentrations.Moreover the compounds of the present invention, contrarily to thiadenol and nicotinic acid known derivatives, show no rebound effect, which is a paradoxal increase in unesterified fatty acids and glycerol above the initial values, consequent to interruption of the drug treatment. Among the compounds of formula I, particularly preferred are those in which B is 3 pyridyl, 5 bromo pyridyl, pyrazinyl or the corresponding N oxides thereof RI is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, methilthioethyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, 2 butyl, phenyl, i.e. from compounds deriving from the amino acids glycine, alanine, phenylalanine, methionine, valine, leucine, isoleucine and phenylglycine, preferably in the L form. Particularly preferred compounds of the invention are 1, 1O bis 2 nicotinoylglicyl ethylthio7decane 1,10 bisE2 5 bromo nicotinoylglycyl ethylthio7decanei 1, 10 bisE2 nicotinoylalanyl ethylthio7decane. The compounds according to the present invention may be prepared by reacting l,10 bisZ2 hydroxyethyl thiojdecane II , with a compound of general formula III EMI7.1 wherein B and R1 have the above mentioned meanings, and X is OH or N,N bis 2 oxo 3 oxazolidinyl phosphorodiamidyl.

The reaction may be carried out at a temperature ranging from 0 to 5O0C, preferably at room temperature, and it is complete within 3 48 hours usually within about 12 hours. Alternatively, compounds of formula III wherein X is OH, are transformed into the corresponding derivatives in which X is a group of formulaEMI9.1 and subsequently reacted with II, according to the procedure of M. Ballester Rodes and A.L. Palomo et al. inSynth. Comm. 515 1984 , to give compounds of general formula I . The reaction between compounds of general formulaIV and compounds of general formula V may be carried out using acyl chlorides of compounds V T C1 , prepared from the corresponding nicotinic, bromonicotinic, fluoronicotinic, pyrazinoic, 5 methyl pyrazinoic acids or theN oxides thereof, according to the method described by R.Wingfield et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 75, 4364 1953 .

Compounds of general formula VII, wherein X is OH, are known in the literature Chemistry of amino acids pag. 922 Schnorremberg and Steglich Angew. Chem. Int.Ed. Engl. 18, 307 1979 . Compounds of general formula VI are prepared by reacting II with said compounds VII in the presence of carbodiimides, preferably dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, in stoichiometric amounts or in slight excess with respect toVII, preferably in a 10 molar excess, and 4 dimethylaminopyridine in a catalytic amount1 preferably in a 10 molar amount with respect to carbodiimide. The reaction may be carried out in aprotic organic solvents such as, for instance, methylene chloride, dichloroethane, diethylenedioxide, tetrahydrofuran, diglyme, dimethoxyethane, dimethylsulfoxide dimethylformamide being preferred. The reaction may be carried out at a temperature ranging from 0 to 5O0C, preferably at room temperature, and it is complete within 3 48 hours, preferably within 12 hours. Alternatively, compounds of formula VII, wherein X is OH, are transformed into the corresponding derivatives in which X is a group of formulaEMI11.1 and subsequently reacted with II, according to M. Balle ster Rodès and A.L. Palomo et al. in Synth. Comm. 515 1984 . Compound 1 , l,lO bisL2 N nicotinoylglicyl ethylthig7decane, was selected as a typical representative example of the compounds of the invention. Pharmacologic and toxicologic characteristics of compound 1 were evaluated in comparison to nicotinic acid 2 a l,10 bisZ2 hydroxyethyl thiojdecane 3 and the esters 1,10 bis 2 nicotinoyl ethylthi 7decane 4 and 1,10 bis 2 nicotino yloxymethylcarbonyloxy ethylthio7decane 5 . Compound 4, described in the above mentioned patents U.S. 4,021,436, FR A 2,146,138, FR A 2,324,303, E.P. A 0053681 and 0060994, and compound 5, which is structurally similar, may be considered as the closest prior art. The formulae of said compounds are reported hereinbelowEMI12.1 The single compounds were administered orally at single equimolecular gradually increasing doses, in order to comparatively evaluate their hypocholesterolemic and hypotriglyceridemic activities. Normolipidemic, and hypercholesterolemic and hypertriglyceridemic rats, following to administration of diets respectively enriched in cholesterol and cholic acid Nath diet or 79.5 fructose, were used. Finally, normolipemic rats, housed under normal conditions, were treated for 5 days with the compounds under test, at gradually increasing doses. At the end of said traitment, the rats were fasted for 16 hours and administered with Triton 1.339, at a dose of 0.5 g kg i.v.Two hours later, the rats were killed and the parameters in comparison with the animals treated respectively with the sole vehicle and Triton were evaluated. Male Sprague Dawley rats of 180 200 g body weight were used. The compounds under test were administered as 18 tylose suspension, by means of gastric probe, 10 animals per dose in comparison with controls, treated with the sole vehicle. Four dose levels 1, 2, 4, 8 10 mol kg were used for each compound under test. The body growth and liver weight were evaluated. In the serum the following values were determined a total cholesterol, by enzymatic method b HDL cholesterol, by enzymatic method, after precipita tion of the other lipoproteins by addition of phospho tungstic acid c triglycerides by enzymatic method, i.e. by means of enzymatic hydrolysis and dosage of the formed glycerol. The dosage of the liver triglycerides has been carried out by enzymatic method on the evaporated liver extract with chloroform methanol 2 1. The results were evaluated and expressed as variation with respect to the control groups. In the hypercholesterolemic animals Nath diet , the comparison compound l,lO bisL2 nicotinoyl ethylthi decane, in all the assayed doses, induced a marked decrease in the HDL concentration, which decreased with the progressive increasing of the administered dose. Moreover, a 10 preliminar increase of the total cholesterol at a 2.10 3 mol kg dose, followed by a 50 decrease versus controls, which did not vary increasing the dose, was evidenced. At all the tested doses, the triglyceride hematic concentration was always higher than that in the control animals, although a tendency to decrease with the increasing of the dose was noted moreover, a gradual increase in the liver weight was observed. A similar behaviour was evidenced after administration of 1,10 bisg nicotinoyloxyacetyl ethylthioSdecane. As an example, at the dose of 4.10 3 mol kg, a 30 decrease of total plasmatic cholesterol was noted. Contemporary decrease in hematic HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, respectively of 6 and 34 , combined with an increase in the concentration of hepatic triglycerides. On the contrary, compound 1,10 bisZ2 nicotinoyl glicyl ethylthio7decane according to the invention, at a dose of 4 10 3 mol kg, induced a decrease in total chole sterol, hematic and hepatic triglycerides respectively of 37, 4 and 48 , with contemporary 7 increase in HDL cholesterol. At the same time, no substantial changes in the liver weight were observed. All the induced changes were statistically significant and dose related, in the considered dose range. The hypotriglyceridemyzing activity of the compounds of the invention, as already mentioned, was evaluated in fructose and Triton induced hypertriglyceridemias, in comparison with the following standard l,10 bisD hydro xyethyl thiSdecane 3 and its nicotinate 4 and nicotinoyloxymethylcarbonyloxy ester 5 . All the compounds were administered at equimolecular gradual dosages. No significant differences among the single compounds in decreasing triglyceride hematic level were evidenced. Said decrease, for instance in the fructose test, was about 50 608 with respect to the control values for all the compounds at an equimolecular dosage corresponding to 100 mg kg day of l,lO bisL2 hydroxyethyl thiodecanel. All the compounds caused a variable but not statistically significant decrease in total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol hematic levels. On the contrary, in the Triton test, HDL cholesterol level appeared to be increased, without significant differencies among the compounds. Surprisingly, compound l,lO bisL2 nicotinoylgli cyl ethylthioSdecane 1 , according to the invention, and its O thioester 5 proved to reduce or keep almost unchanged the triglyceride hepatic concentration, with percent variations from 10 to 10 , with respect to 40 508 increases observed for l,10 bis g hydroxyethyl thioSdeca ne 3 and its nicotinate 4 . This surprising and un foreseeable effect on the triglyceride hepatic concentration, is a substantial and favorable feature of the compounds of the invention. In fact said favorable effect, combined with the contemporary decrease of triglyceride plasmatic concentration, is a sign of a catabolic event on triglycerides, said decrease at plasmatic level not resulting from a redistribution effect of the triglycerides, as it could appear from the increases of the parenchyma. The antilipolytic activity of the compounds of the invention was studied in comparison with l,10 bis 2 hydro xyethylthio decane 3 , which showed no activity, its nicotinic ester 4 , the ester 5 , and nicotinic acid 2 . All the standards 2, 3, 5 and the compounds of the invention proved to have antilipolytic activity both under normal feeding conditions and in the lipolysis process induced by fasting or adrenalin. The compounds were administered orally. The results from some experiments, after administration of compounds in amounts of 11O mol kg, in a single dose, are reported in Tables 1, 2, 3. The results are expressed as pEq l of free fatty acids.TABLE 1 NormolipolysisEMI16.1 tb Time SEP Con SEP nicoti SEP I,lO bis hydroxyethylthio SEP tb SEP trols SEP nic SEP acid SEP decane SEP esters tb SEP 2 SEP nicotina SEP ester SEP nicotino tb SEP te SEP 4 SEP 5 SEP yl SEP glyci tb SEP nate SEP 1 tb Basal SEP 240 SEP 260 SEP 230 SEP 240 SEP 230 tb 2 SEP hours SEP 170 SEP 110 SEP 120 SEP 120 SEP 200 tb 4 SEP hours SEP 280 SEP 160 SEP 155 SEP 170 SEP 225 tb 8 SEP hours SEP 390 SEP 560 SEP 450 SEP 260 SEP 270 tb 10 Animals per group Normally feeded for 7 days, then administered with the test compo unds.

It is well known that nicotinic acid finds a limited therapeutic application, due to its peripheral vasodilating action, inducing undesired side effects such as cephalgia and flushing of the face, which may be so marked and unpleasant as to result in poor patient compliance or even interruption of the treatment. Such a side effect may be experimented on male albino Guinea pigs, weighing 300 400 g, normally feeded and housed in silent room, by observing the vasodilation of ear marginal veins, after administration of the test compounds. Table 4 shows the results obtained comparing nicotinic acid and compounds 1,10 bis 2 hydrodyethylthio deca ne nicotinic ester 4 and ester 5 at doses of 1 10 mol kg, with 1,10 bis 2 nicotinoylglycyl ethylthio decane 1 ester at doses of 1 and 2 10 mol kg.TABLE 4EMI18.1 tb Vasodila SEP Nicoti SEP 1,10 bis 2 hydroxyethyl thiodecane SEP tb ting SEP ef SEP nic SEP acid SEP esters tb fect SEP 2 SEP nicotina SEP ester SEP nicotinoyl tb SEP te SEP 4 SEP 1 SEP 5 SEP glycinate SEP 1 tb SEP 1 SEP and SEP 2 SEP 10 3 tb SEP moles tb Beginning SEP 3 SEP 10 SEP 13 SEP tb Maximal tb effect SEP 6 SEP 25 SEP 30 SEP SEP tb Beginning tb of SEP disap SEP 20 SEP 48 SEP 51 tb pearance tb The above reported data clearly show the marked antilipolytic activity of the compounds according to the invention, in comparison with other nicotinic esters of 1, 1O bis7 2 hydroxyethyl thiq decane having similar lipophylicity. However, the compounds of the invention exhibit the surprising advantages of a long lasting antilipolytic effect and the absence of the rebound effects, characteristic of the other hypolipidemic drugs. Last, but not least, said compounds show no side effects flushing , the therapeutical activity being equal. The compounds of the present invention, particularly 1, 1O bis 2 hydroxyethylthio decane nicotinoylglycyl, 5 bromo nicotinoyl glycyl, 5 methyl pyrazinoylglycyl, nicotinoylalanyl, nicotinoylisoleucyl and nicotinoylphenylalanyl esters, orally administered at doses from 100 to 250 mg kg, protect the mouse from thrombosis induced by the administration of arachidonic acid, as well as collagene and adrenalin, according to the procedure by G. diMinno and M.J. Silver, Mouse antithrombotic assay, J.Pharm. Exper. Therap. 225, 57 1983 . Moreover, the compounds of the invention show a markedly reduced acute toxicity, with very high DL50 values, ranging from 3 and 6 g kg in mice and rats. The very high antilipolytic activity of the compounds of the invention, as well as the poor toxicity thereof, together, contribute to an evident antithrombotic activity in vivo and a clear hypocholesterolemic and hypotriglyceridemic effect. It is particularly significant that the hematic normalization of triglycerides does not induce an increase in their hepatic concentration, thus showing that said effect is not corresponding to a redi stribution of the triglycerides from the plasma to the hepatic area.For these reasons, the compounds according to the invention are particularly useful in human therapy for the treatment and prophylaxis of hyperlipemias of different type and origin, as well as various pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis, thrombotic conditions and vasal disturbances.
