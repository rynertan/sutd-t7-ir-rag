# DIELECTRIC WAVEGUIDE WITH CHLORINE DOPANT

## Abstract
An optical fiber of stepped index of refraction. The fiber core is of fused silica to which chlorine has been added to raise index and lower both its viscosity and hydroxyl ion content. Cladding composition is of either pure fused silica or fused silica to which a dopant, preferably fluorine, has been added.
