# Enhanced detent guide track with dog leg.

## Abstract
An electrical connector having a receptacle means 30 including a receptacle shell 36 and a plug means 31 including a plug housing 60 , coupling means including a coupling nut 72 for rotation of a coupling ring 71 , the coupling nut 72 having threaded engage ment with the plug housing 60 and the coupling ring 71 having a breech lock means 82, 83 engageable with cooperable breech lock lands 48, 49 on the receptacle shell 36 , the plug means and receptacle means being adapated to be fully electrically mated and locked by ro tation of the coupling housing through about 90 degrees. An arcuate detent member 87 of about 180 degrees keyed to the plug housing for relative axial movement re ceived within an annular groove 86 in the plug housing for resilient forcible selective engagement of opposite radially outwardly enlarged ends 114 of the arcuate detent member with two sets of radially outwardly formed recesses 116, 116a in the coupling ring. When the cou pling ring is rotated to full locked position of the plug and receptacle means, ends of the arcuate member are forc ibly snapped into one set of recesses to indicate locked and fully mated position by sound and by feel. Rotation of the coupling ring in the opposite direction unlocks the plug and receptacle means and the detent member is released from the first set of recesses to engage a second set of recesses in the coupling ring to audibly and tactilely indicate unlocked position. The resilient arcuate member comprises an enlarged centre portion having a key 110, 3a which is designed to mate with and ride in a recess 111 on the plug housing with an enlarged portion of the recess defining a dog leg in the path of the axial travel of the plug housing. The key or tang 110, 3a makes audible contact with a terminal wall of the dog leg producing an intensified audible snap in the fully mated and locked position of the connector.
