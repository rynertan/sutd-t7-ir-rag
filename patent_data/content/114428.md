Pain. 2.116.040, Teller et al., published SepSer 21, 1983 and European Pat. pin. 0,005,286, Nyquist, pt shed Nov. 14, 1979. U.S. Pat. No. 3,154,495, Robson et al., issued October 22, 1964, discloses articles comprising enveloped granular and small tableted hypochlorite materials. A partially dissolving cake is disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 4,281,421, Nyquist, Kltko and Stradling, issued August 4, 1981. The Nyquist et al. patent is directed to a partially insoluble cake comprising hypochlorite and metasilicate salts. One drawback to these cakes is that much of the hypochlorite is wasted. All of the cake is not immersed in liquid just the lower part, and leaching will not dissolve the active located in the top part of the cake. Another drawback is substantial nonuniform delivery of the active. U.S. Pat. No. 4,208,747, Dirksing, issued June 24, 1980, discloses highly effective dispensers which are placed in a toilet tank and which receive a dose volume of water from the toilet tank and dispense a dose volume of a solution of cleaning or disinfecting composition every time the toilet is flushed. This patent teaches that cake compositions can be used as the source of cleaning and disinfecting agents in such dispensers, but fails to address specific problems posed by certain types of cakes.One problem is that a cake of calcium hypochlorite material immersed completely in the dosing liquid tends to initially deliver excessively high levels of chlorine. Thus, the chlorine is used up too fast. Figs. 9 14 and 18 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,208,747,Dirksing, disclose top feed dispensers in which such cakes are completely immersed in the dosing liquid. There, the solution is drawn from above the cake. Such cakeldispenser combinations do not deliver a consistent amount of available chlorine over the life of the cake. Dirksing also discloses a dosing dispenser of the bottomfeed type illustrated in Figs. 1 8 and 15 17. Symmetrical rectangular shaped cakes are used therein. In such dispensers the bleach cake is only partially immersed in dosing liquid in the reservoir. The solution is drawn from an area near the bottom of the cake. U.S. Pat. No. 4,307,474, Choy, issued December 29, 1981, discloses a passive dosing dispenser exhibiting improved resistance to gel clogging. An anti clogging means comprising support means in the lowermost portion of the product chamber cake compartment and a level control means to control the level of liquid in the product chamber are also disclosed. The support means help to prevent gelled and solid chips from obstructing the flow of liquid in and out of the chamber. Some major problems in this art have been with dissolving bleach cakes. One is dispensing even concentrations of the bleach. One cause of this is that particles from said cakes pass into the reservoir of the dispenser and thereby reduce the effective volume of liquid which is needed for rapid equilibrium and formation of the dosage of bleach which is to be dispensed in the next flush of the toilet. Further, the particles which break off the cake and pass through to the toilet water result in a loss of efficient bleach use, and some of the particles may clog the passageways through which liquid flows from the dispenser.Another problem has been that most of the effective volume of bleach liquid in the reservoir was dispensed with each dose. Yet another problem with some dispenser designs has been failure to dispense a full dose of bleach liquid each time. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The summary of the invention is an article of manufacture comprising a dosing dispenser containing a solid cake of water soluble calcium hypochlorite within a cake compartment, said dispenser including means for allowing a dose volume of aqueous liquid to be routed through a reservoir and into said compartment with each dispensing cycle and means for immersing a lowermost portion of the cake to a predetermined depth in said aqueous liquid to facilitate dissolving a portion of said cake for dispensing at a later time CHARACTERIZED IN THAT said cake is substantially completely water soluble said cake weighing from 45 gms to 120 gms and having a density of from 1.5 to 2.3gmslcc said compartment having free space to allow the cake to gravity feed by dissolution into said aqueous liquid said dispenser receiving from 7 to 16 mis of liquid and having a baffle means a to limit the size of an air bubble lock which isolates toilet tank water liquid from liquid inside the dispenser reservoir, b to maintain in said reservoir a volume of aqueous hypochlorite liquid which is 6 ml to 12 ml said reservoir liquid and said dose having a volumetric ratio of from 3 1 to 6 1 said aqueous liquid in said reservoir having an average concentration of 9 to 15 said hypochlorite active, and whereby said dosing dispenser providing a substantially uniform concentration of hypo chlorite solution for each dispensing cycle for the life of the cake. An object of the present invention is to provide a dispenser and cake combination which delivers all of the available chlorine in the cake at a substantially uniform rate, over a long period of time, throughout the life of the dispenser. Another object is to provide a dispenser which does not clog. Yet another object of the present invention is to limit the size of air bubble within the air lock inside the dispenser to assure discharge of a full small dose of liquid bleach. Other objects of the present invention will be apparent in the light of the following disclosure.

The Particle Retaining Filter Means A preferred filter means is a filter sleeve of water permeable laid fibers which envelopes a calcium hypochlorite based bleach cake, which cake weighs 45 to 120 gms and has a density of 1.3 to 2.3 gms cc. The particle retaining filter means can take many forms including a cup containing the cake, a filter sleeve on the cake, and a screen on the bottom of the cake compartment 69.The filter means of this invention retains particles of 150 microns and above. Preferably the filter means is an envelope or sleeve made of water permeable laid hypochlorite resistant fibers selected from the group consisting of nylon, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, acrylonitrile, acrylonitrile copolymers, polyvinyl chloride acetate, polymethyl methacrylate, polyvinylidene chloride, asbestos, glass and mixtures thereof in which 40 to 100 of said fibers are thermoplastic, said laid fibers having a porosity from 200 to 800 cfm sq.ft. and preferably from 200 to 650 cfm sq.ft.

Such net materials are sold by Kendal Co. The dosing dispenser is placed into the water tank of a toilet. The dispenser has means for passively receiving a dose volume of water from the tank. U.S. Pat. No. 4,208,747,Dirksing, issued June 24, 1980, is incorporated herein by reference for its teachings on passive dosing dispensers, their preparation and operation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING It will be noted that dual dispensers are shown in the drawings. The surfactant cake 21 is isolated from the bleach cake 22.The dual dispensers are similar. Corresponding element numbers for the surfactant side are designated S . Both dispensers have vent holes 86, vent tubes 72, cake compartments 69, outlets 71, baffles 67, passageways 70, bubble lock 3, air trap 76, reservoirs 5, and exit ports 7. The bleach cake vent tube 72 has a bulb 73. The surfactant side has protrusion 79S to steady the cake.The baffle means must be designed to limit the size of the air lock bubble. The bubble 3 must be small enough to allow the dose volume of liquid above the baffle 67 to be discharged. Note that inlet outlet exit port 7 leads to first inlet outlet passage way 32, which is in fluid communication with the bubble lock 3, which is in fluid communication with second inlet outlet passageway 31 on the internal reservoir 5 side. Incline 33 of passageway 70 is sufficiently steep to shear excess air and vent same during refill. Passageway 70 leads to cake compartment 69 and vent tube 72. The present invention is understood more clearly in the light of this disclosure and commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 4,305,162, to Cornelisse, Jr., et al., issued December 15, 1981, for PassiveDosing Dispenser Enveloping Captive Air Bubble to ProvideProduct Isolation, incorporated herein by reference. The reservoir section 5 below baffle 67 for the bleach cake preferably holds about 8 mis. It can hold from about 6 mis to about 12 mis. The amount of liquid in the dispenser above baffle 67 is about 1 ml to about 4 mis. This is equal to the dose volume for the bleach dispensed. The bubble lock 3 is smaller than 3S and baffle 67 is higher than 67S to thereby facilitate firing of a smaller doses while maintaining a 3 1 to 6 1 volumetric ratio of reservoir to dose volume. The received water is routed to compartment 69 within the dispenser which contains the active. The dispenser has a lowermost edge 62 means for immersing only a lowermost portion of the cake to a predetermined depth in the received water to facilitate dissolving a portion of the cake for dispensing at a later time.The bleach cake in compartment 69 is enveloped in a filter sleeve means 1 which contains the cake 22 and retains cake particles which become detached from the cake during use. The filter sleeve 1 is an envelope of laid fibers. Alternatively, the filter means can be a water permeable cup not shown which is formed to the configuration of cake and which contains the cake. The cup will be made of a hypochlorite resistant material which will be positioned in the bottom of the compartment 69. The liquid in the compartment 69 is drawn out each time the dispenser is fired, responsive to the flushing of the toilet. The quantity of fluid subject to discharge during the flush cycle is preferably 2 mis and the volume of solution in the dispenser including reservoir 5 is preferably from 7 to 16 mis, with 6 to 12 mis of this being in reservoir 5. When the toilet is flushed, the external water level 75 in the toilet tank drops, causing water level 2 to drop. The air bubble 3 moves out exit port 7. The volume of liquid above baffle 67 is released from the dispenser. As soon as the liquid level falls from level 2 to the baffle 67, the discharge action is terminated.None of the liquid volume below baffle 67 will be discharged.The same applies for the surfactant side. The reservoir section 5 holds from about 6 mis up to about 12 mis this volume of liquid insures that the concentration of bleach to be fired on the next flush will be potent in a rapid flush situation. For the surfactant side, the reservoir section 5S preferably holds about 10 to about 12 mis . The dose volume for the surfactant solution is preferably about 5 mis, which is larger than the bleach dose. The Surfactant Cake Preferred surfactant cake compositions are disclosed in the European Pat. 0 on. , licant s reference Case 3090, Waw, Sterling Border for Buffered Alkali Earth petal Surfactant Cakes for Dosing Divnss filed of even date, inoorporate herein by reference. The dimensions of a preferred bleach cake compartment 69 are about 9.1 cms x 5.0 cms x 2.2 cms. The dimensions of a preferred bleach cake 21 are 8.4 cms x 4.1 cms x 1.9 cms. The cake is sized to initially occupy most of the cake compartment space within the dispenser reservoir. The cake and the cake compartment preferably have cake surfaces and vertical compartment walls which are parallel to each other. It is important that there is at least 0.4 cm to 4 cms of free space between the vertical cake surfaces and the cake compartment walls. Some preferred free spaces are from 0.4 cm to 4 cms, 0.5 cm to 1.5 cms, and 0.5 cm to 2 cms. The dispenser retains the hypochlorite solution in substantial isolation from the body of toilet tank water during quiescent periods in between flushes. Upon flushing of the toilet, an available chlorine level of from about 2 parts per million pom to about 10 ppm is established in the toilet bowl water. The hypochlorite solution formed in the dispenser reservoir generally contains from about 0.5 to about 158 available chlorine. The average concentration of available chlorine there is typically from 9 to 15 and preferably 10 to 11 . The solid cake is formulated to slowly dissolve and gravity feed into the water in the cake compartment 69 of the dispenser and disappear after the toilet has been flushed a sufficient number of times to exhaust all of the hypochlorite in the cake.It is important, for a more uniform delivery of bleach, that the dispenser has a means to maintain in the reservoir section 9 a volume of aqueous liquid of about 6 mis to about 12 mis. The dispensed dose volume should be about 1 3 to about 1 6 of the reservoir volume. Again, the idea is to deliver about 1 ml to about 4 mis, preferably about 1.5 to 3 mis of concentrated hypochlorite solution. This is accomplished by adjusting the elements of the dispenser shown in the drawings. It is important to design the elements of the dispenser so that the complete intended doses will discharge. The Bleach Cake The calcium hypochlorite cake of this invention is preferably a tableted solid composition comprising I from about 10 to about 98 of a substantially stable calcium hypochlorite Il an effective amount of a water soluble calcium hypochlorite cake swelling control salt selected from the group consisting of lithium hypochlorite material Form 2R , lithium hydroxide, lithium sulfate, lithium chloride and other water soluble lithium salts, and mixtures thereof and Ill the balance being a mixture of salts and other by product materials normal to the manufacture of calcium hypochlorite. See the examples for preferred compositions. Bleach Cake Preparation The compacted solid calcium hypochlorite cake compositions of this invention may be prepared by conventional compacting procedure. For example, granules of calcium hypochlorite, e.g.,HTH, and granules of the selected swelling control salts are mixed together, and this mixture is then pressed into a cake with a compacting machine. The granules are generally in a size range of from about 50 microns to about 1,000 microns prior to compacting. The compacted solids can also be formed by tabletting, slugging, Chilsonating, or otherwise converting the granular hypochlorite mixture into compacted forms. Compacting may be accomplished at pressures of from about 0.5 tons square inch to about 200 tons square inch, preferably from about 1.0 tons square inch to about 50 tonsisquare inch to about 5.0 tons square inch.The compacting can be done on any conventional compacting apparatus, e.g., a Stokes Model R4 Tablet Press.The compacted cakes generally have a specific gravity of about 1.3 to about 2.3, preferably from about 1.5 to about 2.0. The cakes weigh from 45 gm to 120 gm. A preferred cake is disclosed in commonly owned British Pat. Zllq ln. 2.116.040, Irhheller et al.published Septarber 21, 1983, incorporated herein bv reference in its entirety. The cake is formed into shapes with dimensions appropriate to fit the cake compartment of the gravity feed dosing dispenser which holds the cake.
