## Description
Aqueous copolsester dispersions suited for the subbing of polyester films subbed polyester film and photo graphic materials containing a subbed polyester base. The present invention relates to aqueous copolyester dispersions suited for the subbing of polyester film, subbed polyester film and photographic materials containing a subbed polyester base. In order to ensure a good adhesion of a hydrophilic layer such as a photographic gelatin silver halide emulsion layer to a polyester film support, adhesive layers known as subbing layers are applied between the support and the emulsion layer. In most cases two intermediate layers are needed. The first adhesive layer is coated directly onto the support and is normally called primer layer . The second adhesive layer coated onto the primer layer is normally a subbing layer containing a great deal of hydrophilic colloid such as gelatin. To give a sufficiently high dimensional stability and mechanical strength to the polyester film support it is necessary, as is generally known, to orient the film biaxially and to heat set it at relatively high temperature. This biaxial orienting can be performed by subjecting the film simultaneously to a longitudinal and transversal stretching, usually, however, by stretching the film first in one direction and afterwards in a direction perpendicular to the first. In practice, the longitudinal stretching is carried out first. This stretching of the film up to 3 to 5 times the original dimensions is performed at a temperature comprised between the glass transition temperature and the softening temperature of the polyester. In the case of films of polyethylene terephthalate the stretching is usually performed between 800 and 9000. After the biaxial stretching the film is conducted through a heat setting zone wherein the film is heated until a temperature between 1800 and 2200C is reached, the film being kept under tension in both directions. In this way a dimensionally stable fully clear polyester film is obtained. The method usually applied for coating the above mentioned two layers comprises the application of an aqueous solution or dispersion of a resin or mixture of resins between the longitudinal stretching and the transversal stretching of the polyester support to form the primer layer, and the application of a gelatin containing subbing layer after the film support carrying the primer layer has been stretched transversally and heat set. The technique of using an aqueous copolyester dispersion for forming a primer layer has been described in the published German Patent Application IIE OS 2,813,014 of John R.Allison and Charles A.Itewitt, issued November 12,1957. The copolyesters described therein have been modified so that they carry free acid groups e.g. carboxyl and sulpho groups. In a particular embodiment subbing proceeds by coating a polyester support with a 30 by weight aqueous dispersion of a copolyester produced from isophthalic acid,diethylene glycol and a sulphoderivative of a dicarboxylic acid such as sulphoterephthalic acid or sulphoisophthalic acid. This copolyesterz soldunderthe trade name EAST WI we SIZE and has a glass transition temperature Tg of 3700. other aqueous dispersions containing solvent soluble linear copolyesters modified with a sulphonated aromatic compound, which on a total of 100 molar acid equivalents includes from about 0.1 molar to about 10 molar equivalents of sulphonated aromatic compound, are described in the United States Patent Soecification 3,563,942 of PhilipHeiberger, issued February 16, 1971. One process disclosed in said US Specification for producing a dispersion in water of said solvent soluble linear copolyesters is by post emulsification. Post emulsification is accomplished by dissolving the solid copolyesters in an organic solvent, adding water and a surfactant to the so lution to form an emulsion, and then evaporating the organic solvent. So,this technique of making a dispersion still does not exclude the use of solvents, which may pose fire hazards, may have toxic properties and are rather expensive. It would therefore be particularly advantageous if in the preparation of the copolyester dispersions the use of these solvents could be excluded and nevertheless dispersions could be obtained that still meet the special requirements for their use as primer layer on a polyester film base such as high resin concentration of the coating composition without too high a viscosity preferably below 10 mPa.s at 200C, sufficient adhesion of the coated primer layer towards the polyester film base and later on towards the second intermediate layer or directly to a gelatino silver halide emulsion layer, and good optical clearness. It has now been found according to the invention that stable aqueous copolyester dispersions suitable for application as a subbing layer on polyester film without use of.organic solvents can be prepared with a copolyester essential ly consisting of recurring ester groups derived from ethylene glycol and a mixture of terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid and sulphoisophthalic acid whose sulpho group is in salt form, wherein said acid mixture contains from 20 to 60 mole of isophthalic acid and from 6 to 10 mole of said sulphoisophthalic acid, the remainder being terephthalic acid the copolyester has a glass transition temperature above 4500 and an intrinsic viscosity of from 0.15 to 0.45dl g when measured at 2500 in a mixture of phenol o dichlorobenzene 60 40 by volume . The synthesis of the above mentioned copolyester can proceed by the common two step preparation technique for polyesters viz. by esterification starting from the free carboxylic acids and polycondensation, or by transesterification and polycondensation. The sulphoisophthalic acid is not used as such in the synthesis but as sulpho salt particularly containing the group S03M wherein M is an alkali metal or an onium group e.g. ammonium and organic onium. As is well known, the formation of an ester from an alcohol and an acid is a condensation reaction whose stoichiometry is 1 1 on a molar basis. In practice, however, an amount of dihydric alcohol, in this instance ethylene glycol is used in excess up to 70 to 100 molar in the reaction mixture which excess is distilled off during esterification and polycondensation. The polycondensation proceeds advantageously in the melt of reactants in the presence of a catalyst used for that reaction, e.g. zinc acetate dihydrate and antimony III oxide, as described for example in United States Patent Specification 3,054,703 of Donald Eugene Brasure, issued September 18, 1962. The particular proportions of sulpho groups and the degree of condensation, i.e. intrinsic viscosity provide the required dispersibility in water of the copolyester. Particularly stable aqueous copolyester dispersions containing particles of average size not greater than 50 nm can be obtained with copolyesters having from 6 to 10 mole of esterified sodium sulphoisophthalic acid and an intrinsic viscosity of from 0.15 to 0.30 dl g measured at 250C in a mixture of phenol o dichlorobenzene 60 40 by volume . The aqueous copolyester dispersion used for subbing purposes according to the present invention may be prepared by introducing said copolyester in powder or granular form, optionally together with a dispersing agent, into water and raising the temperature above the glass transition temperature with stirring till a latex is obtained containing dispersed copolyester particles whose preferred mean size is not larger than 50 nm. By means of said dispersing technique using the above copolyesters from ethylene glycol, and a mixture of isoph thalic acid, terephthalic acid and sulphoisophthalic acid salt form , latexes having a concentration of at least 20 by weight of copolyester can be obtained. The copolyester latexes according to the invention are particularly suitable for priming a polyester film that can be longitudinally stretched after the coating and drying of the primer layer. Thus, the present invention includes also any polyester film material coated with the above copolyester from an aqueous dispersion free from organic solvents. A preferred polyester film material used as support, e.g. in photographic material, is polyethylene terephthalate. Al though the samples hereinafter set forth are directed to the subbing of a polyethylene terephthalate film base, other polyester films can be used, e.g. polyesters resulting from the polycondensation of glycol or mixture of glycols, with terephthalic acid or mixtures of terephthalic acid with minor amounts of other dicarboxylic acids such as isophthalic acid, diphenic acid and sebacic acid. The polyester film may contain pigments or dyes and when used as base forX ray film is, e.g., tinted blue. The aqueous copolyester dispersion may be applied to the polyester film support either before or after it has been stretched or oriented. Preferably, however, it is applied before longitudinal stretching the film, e.g. in the temperature of from 80 to 10000 with a stretch ratio in the range of 2.5 1 to 4.0 1. If desired adhesion improving agents may be incorporated in the aqueous dispersion in dissolved form, e.g. resorcinol, pyrocatechol, dihydroxytoluene, and chloral hydrate. Other useful ingredients that may be added are, e.g., surface active coating agents, colloidal silica and embossing agents i.e.particles for creating microscopic protrusions of less than 3 pm for obtaining a thin air space between the subbed material and a material touching it, e.g.during transport of the film. Such embossing agents can be known matting agents, e.g. those described in the EuropeanPatent Application 79 200053.1 filed January 30, 1979 byAgfa Gevaert N.V. After the coating and drying of the aqueous copolyester dispersion forming a primer layer and the longitudinal stretching of the primed polyester film normally a second subbing layer mainly containing gelatin and plasticizer s for allowing an easy transversal stretching is coated onto the primer layer before transversal stretching. After drying of the second subbing layer s the stretching in transverse direction may be effected, e.g. at a draw of 2.5 1 to 4.0 1.Thereupon the film is heat set by heating in the range of 18000 to 22000 for 0.1 to 2 minutes while it is restrained from shrinkage in both directions. The aqueous gelatin coating composition used for forming the second subbing layer of photographic silver halide materials contains plasticizers that are photographically inert and that have the property of making gelatinous layers stretchable without impairing their transparency as described, e.g. in the United States Patent Specification 3,988,157 of August Jean Van Paesschen and Bucien Janbaptist Van Gossum, issued October 26, 1976.In this respect are mentioned aliphatic polyhydroxy compounds such as glyce rol, sorbitol, trip 5 3 hydroxy ethyl glycerol,l ,1 ,ltr4ydro xymethyl propane, 2 nitro 2 ethyl 1 , 3 propanediol, 1,3 dichloro 2 propanol, 1 , 2 ,4 butanetriol, 3 hydroxymethyl 2 ,4 dihydr oxyp entane, 1,2, 6 hexanetri ol, 2 hydroxymethyl 4 hy droxyamyl alcohol, glycerol aldehyde, glycerol dichlorohydrin, and mannitol. Equally suitable compounds are caprolactam, N,N dimethylurea, resorcinol, pyrocatechol, and dichlorodiethyl ether. Other suitable plasticizers are aliphatic carboxylic or sulphonic acids such as malonic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, mono and di chloro acetic acid, 1,2,3 propene tricarboxylic acid, trimelli tic acid, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, and 2 sulpho ethyl methacrylate further aromatic acids such as phthalic acid, o sulphobenzoic acid, o nitrobenzoic acid, o aminobenzoic acid, p hydroxybenzoic acid, and salicylic acid. Moreover, polymeric plasticizers can be added to the gelatin coating composition, e.g. latices of copolymers of butadiene and a lower alkyl ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid e.g. a copolymer of butadiene and methyl methacrylate containing 20 80 by weight of methyl methacrylate. These latices have been described in the United Kingdom PatentSpecification 1,053,043 filed January 23, 1964 by GevaertPhoto Producten N.V. Hardening agents, spreading agents, antistatic or metal complexing agents can be also be added to the aqueous gelatin containing coating composition. Suitable antistatic or metal complexing agents are the sodium salt of polystyrene sulphonic acid, alkali metal salts of co styrene maleic acid , inorganic salts such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and sodium orthositicate, further citric acid,sulphosalicylic acid, 2,5 disulphohydroquinone, the sodium salt of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, ethanolamino diacetic acid, the sodium salt of N o hydroxybenzyl amino diacetic acid, the monosodium salt of vanadic acid, 3,5 disulphopyrocatechol, phosphono acetic acid, ethylene1,2 diphosphonic acid, butylene 1,4 diphosphonic acid, and ascorbic acid. Other possible ingredients for the second subbing layer are, e.g. surface active coating aids, colloidal silica, and the already mentioned embossing agents. After the film base has been heat set a photographic material may be formed by applying a light sensitive layer such as a gelatino silver halide emulsion layer optionally directly to the primer layer but preferably onto the second subbing layer mainly containing gelatin. The invention re lates to such a silver halide photographic film but is not restricted thereto. Any of the light sensitive layers containing a photosensitive substance in a hydrophilic colloid medium can be adhered very well to the present subbed polyester film support. The hydrophilic colloid layer may contain as photosensitive substances photosensitive silver halide grains, photosensitive iron salts or complexes e.g. iron III ammo nium oxalate or diazonium compounds. Other non lightsensitive hydrophilic colloid layers e.g. gelatin antihalation layers can be adhered very well to the subbed polyester support. The composition of the photographic silver halide emulsion layers may be of any type known to those skilled in the art and for their composition preparation and coating reference is made, e.g. to Research Disclosure 17,643 of December 1978. The preparation of the copolyesters suitable for use according to the invention is illustrated by the following Preparation of the copolyester of ethylene glycol and a mixture of terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid and 5sulphoisophthalic acid sodium salt wherein the acids are present in a molar ratio of 53 40 7. A reaction mixture of 1028.2 g of dimethyl terephthalate 5.3 moles 776 g of dimethyl isophthalate 4 moles 207.2 g of 5 sulphoisophthalic acid dimethyl ester sodium salt 0.7 mole 1240 g of ethylene glycol 20 moles 220 mg of zinc acetate dihydrate and 292 mg of antimony III oxide was heated to 1600C whilst stirring in a nitrogen atmosphere. At that temperature re esterification took place and methanol was distilled. Gradually the temperature was raised to 2500C over a period of 3 to 4 h, until no methanol distilled anymore. Thereupon the temperature was further raised to 270 275 C and the reaction mixture subjected to a reduced pressure of 0.1 0.2 mm Hg. Under these conditions thepolycondensation took place within a period of 20 to 40 min. After cooling the solidified copolyester was milled and obtained in powder form. Depending on the time of polycondensation the intrinsic viscosity ni of the copolyester was from 0.15 to 0.3Odl g measured at a temperature of 2500 in a mixture of phenol and o dichlorobenzene 60 40 by volume . The preparation of a stable aqueous copolyester dispersion latex for use according to the present invention was carried out as follows In a 1 litre round bottomed flask a mixture of 100 g of the above copolyester in powder or granular form, 20 ml of a 10 by weight solution in water of HOSTAPAL BV trade name of Farbwerke Hoechst W.Germany for a 50 by weight aqueous solution ofEMI9.1 and 400 ml of water was heated to 95 97 C whilst stirring stirrer speed about 400 r.p.m. . The mixture was kept at that temperature whilst stirring until the viscosity became equal to or lower than 10 mPa s at 2000 and the average particle size reached a value equal to or smaller than 50 nm.After cooling to room temperature 2000 a stable aqueous dispersion of said copolyester was obtained.

The copolyesters 1 to 3, 5, 6, 9 and 11 to 13 are suited for use according to the present invention. The intrinsic viscosity of copolyester No.4 is too high, which results in too large an average particle size. The copolyester No.7 is less stable in dispersed state and yields a mat layer on drying. The copolyester No.8 yields a latex that is not stable and gelifies on standing for 14 days. The copolyester No.10 yields a latex with too large an average particle size. The copolyester No.14 yields no latex dispersion at all in aqueous medium but a copolyester solution. The present invention is illustrated by the following examples without, however, limiting it thereto. The ratios and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. Example 1. Polyethylene terephthalate was melt extruded at about 28000 from a slot die onto a rotating drum on which it was quenched to about 7500 to form a film having a thickness of 1.2 mm. The cooled film was coated at both sides at a coverage of 1 litre per 50 sq.m with the following coating mixture 20 aqueous dispersion of copolyester No.2 900 ml 10 aqueous solution of USIRAVON W trade name of Ciba Geigy A.G., Switzerland, for the disodium salt of 2 heptadecylbenzimidazole disulphonic acid 5 ml SYTON W3 trade name of Monsanto Chemical Company, St.Louis, No., U.S.A. for a 30 colloidal disper sion of silica in water average particle size 120 nm 6 ml water up to 1000 ml. After drying the primed film was longitudinally stretched at about 8400 with a draw ratio of 3.5 1 and immediately thereupon cooled in water as described in the British Patent Application No. 79.12.859 filed April 11, 1979 by Agfa Gevaert N.V. To both sides of the thus stretched film a layer was applied in a ratio of 1 litre per 100 sq.m. from the following coating composition gelatin 25 g malonic acid 10 g 10 aqueous solution of AMBITERIC H trade name of GLOVERS CHEM.LTI . for a 85 by weight aqueous solution of 10 mlEMI12.1 R1 C8 C18 alkyl each of R2 and R4 lower alkyl, Rod lower alkylene urea formaldehyde coated silica particles having an average particle size of 2 pm and being prepared as described in the published European Patent Application 79 200053.1 0.8 g water up to 1000 ml The pH of the coating composition was adjusted to 8 with ammonia. After drying with a hot air stream the coated film was stretched to 3.5 times in the transverse direction at about 800C and heat set while kept under tension at 2200C for about 10 s. After heat setting the subbed film was cooled and wound up on a core. The film had finally a thickness of about 0.10 mm and was optically clear. The thus double side subbed polyester film was provided at one side with a gelatino antihalation layer and at the other side with a gelatin silver halide emulsion layer as used in the manufacture of a photographic material for application in the graphic arts. The adhesion in dry state was checked before and after processing development, rinsing, fixing and washing . The gelatin containing silver halide emulsion layer was scratched cross wise by means of a sharp knife, whereafter an adhesive tape that had been pressed thereon was torn off at once. The quality of adhesion prooved to be particularly good because but very small pieces of the photographic layer were torn off. The adhesion in wet state was checked by scratching the material superficially and trying to rub off the gelatin layer with a finger after each step of the photographic pro cessing development, rinsing, fixing, rinsing . The gelatin layer was not rubbed off. Example 2 A melt extruded amorphous polyethylene terephthalate film having a thickness of 2.2 mm was coated at both sides at a coverage of 1 litre per 50 sq.m. with the following coating mixture 20 aqueous dispersion of copolyester No.11 900 ml 10 aqueous solution of ULTRAVON W trade name 5 ml water up to 1000 ml After drying the primed film was longitudinally stretched at about 840C with a draw ratio of 3.5 1 and immediately thereupon cooled in water as described in the British PatentApplication No. 791285.9. To both sides of the thus stretched film a layer was appliedina ratio of 1 litre per 100 sq.m. from the following coating composition gelatin 25 g malonic acid 4 g sorbitol 10 ml 10 aqueous solution of ULTRAVON W trade name 10 ml water up to 1000 ml The pH of the coating composition was adjusted to 8 with ammonia. The film was further treated as described in Example 1 and had finally a thickness of 0.180 mm. The double side subbed polyester film was provided at both sides with a gelatino silver halide emulsion layer as used in X ray film. The adhesion was tested as described in Example 1 and analogous results of adhesion in dry and wet state were obtained. Example 3 A melt extruded amorphous polyethylene terephthalate film having a thickness of 1.4 mm was single side coated at a coverage of 1 litre per 60 sq.m with the following coating mixture 25 aqueous dispersion of copolyester No.12 900 ml 10 aqueous solution of ULTRAVON W trade name 6 ml SYTON W 30 trade name 6 ml water up to 1000 ml The pli of the coating composition was adjusted to 8 with ammonia. After drying the primer layer the film was longitudinally stretched at a draw of 3.5 1. Thereupon a subbing layer was applied to the primer layer at a coverage of 1 litre per 100 sq.m from the following coating composition gelatin 50 g malonic acid 2 g 10 aqueous solution of AMBITERTC H trade name 15 ml water up to 1000 ml The pH of the coating composition was adjusted up to 8. To the non subbed side an anti static layer was applied as described in Example 4 of the United States Patent Specification 4,089,997 of August Jean Van Paesschen and Lu cm yen cranbaptist Van Gossum, issued May 16 1978. After drying with a hot air stream and transverse stretching as in Example 1 the film had finally a thickness of 0.12 mm. The subbed side of the film was coated with a gelatino silver halide emulsion layer suited for the production of black and white ciné film. The adhesion in dry and wet state was tested as described in Example 1 and showed to be good.
