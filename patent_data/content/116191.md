# Conveyor system with bi planar chain.

## Abstract
A conveyor system 20 employs a belt 22 of the type having load carrying areas 40 and yieldable areas 38 in alternating sequence. The belt travels along a path estab lished by a cruciform track 28 containing a pulling chain 26 having alternating horizontal and vertical links 54, 56 , each link being joined to a roller carriage 58 at each of its opposite ends. The axes of the chain 60 are substantially coplanar with each other and with the yieldable areas 38 of the belt, and each belt section 34 is connected to a link 54, 56 . The track may be split into longitudinal halves 66 joined to a common web 30 by fasteners 84 alternately removable from opposite track halves for service access. Support leg structures 32 attached to the web 30 carry the track 28 and complete covers 134, 136 may enclose the track 28 and belt 22 . Expansion joints 100, 102 permit small variations in the length of track runs. Intermediate powered drive units 96 engage the chain in a reliable manner.
