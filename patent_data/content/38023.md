# Fiber optic directional coupler.

## Abstract
A fiber optic directional coupler comprises first and second strands 11 of single mode fiber optic material having a portion of the cladding 37 removed from one side thereof, and means 16 positioning the strands together with the portion of the strands where the cladding is removed in close facing proximity to each other to form a region 33 of interaction in which light is transferred between the strands. Said strands diverge away from each other at the ends of the region of interaction, and the spacing between the core portions of the strands and the length of the region of interaction is such that the light makes a single transfer between the strands in the region of interaction.
