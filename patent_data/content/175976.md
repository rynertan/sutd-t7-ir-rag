# Circuit breaker with bimetal and calibration adjusting means.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a circuit breaker with thermal trip means including an elongate bimetallic element and adjusting means therefor. The adjusting means comprises a lever 416 which is rigidly connected to the bimetallic element 410 adjacent the supported end thereof, and an adjusting member screw 420 which cooperates with the lever and is manually operable to adjust the lever and, through its rigid connection with the bimetallic element, the latter. Any stress introduced in the bimetallic element during adjustment thereof is confined to the supported and inactive end portion of the element whereas its active portion, i.e. the portion which contributes to bimetallic deflection, remains unstressed.
