# Filter press type electrolytic cell and frames for use therein.

## Abstract
A filter press type electrolytic cell 11 for the electrolysis of brine to produce chlorine and caustic includes a plurality of rectangular frames 13, 15 having U shaped or channel shaped wall members 91, 93, 95, 97 , the open sides of each of which wall members face inwardly, and a downcomer tube 111 in each frame 13, 15 for conducting product from near the top of the frame 97 to the bottom 93 thereof for withdrawal. The downcomer tubes 111 are located near a framing side 95 but are not within a framing channel. The openings of the wall members 91, 93, 95, 97 are partially covered by cross members 101, 104, 109 of the same material as the framing to improve the resistance thereof to distortion during closing of the cell 11 . Utilization of the downcomer tubes 111 , preferably of polytetra fluoroethylene for the catholyte compartment and titanium or titanium clad material for the anolyte compartment, allows the maintaining of the framing channel open so that inner walls thereof are electrolytically protected against corrosion. The invention also relates to frames 13, 15 for use in filter press type electrolytic cells 11 and to a method of electrolyzing, wherein such frames 13, 15 and cells 11 may be employed.
