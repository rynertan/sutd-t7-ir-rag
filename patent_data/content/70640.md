# Production of vinyl chloride polymers.

## Abstract
Production of vinyl chloride polymer of high porosity by polymerising vinyl chloride in aqueous suspension and injecting an effective surfactant at a monomer to polymer conversion within the range 15 to 65 . An effective surfac tant is found to be one which lowers the interfacial tension between 1,2 dichloroethylene and water to 8 dynes cm ยน.
