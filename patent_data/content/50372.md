# SPIRAL TYPE HEAT EXCHANGER

## Abstract
A system for heating or cooling articles conveyed in a vertical helical path is defined by an endless con veyor belt driven at its inner edge by contact with a rotating drum and a circulating heat exchange fluid propelled horizontally onto the articles by axial flow fans rotating in a vertical plane. The system features a novel arrangement employing scroll means for confin ing the circulating heat exchange fluid to a substantial portion of the helical path and location of fan means such that the heat exchange fluid is propelled in push pull manner from the discharge side of one fan means to the intake or suction side of a second fan means. In the preferred embodiment directed to refrigeration of conveyed articles, more particularly foodstuffs to be frozen, the conveyor is located within an insulating hous ing. Further featured novelty includes location of the driving means for the rotating drum externally of the housing and directing of refrigerant, such as liquid COâ‚‚ into the fan blast in a direction counter to that of the blast.
