# Combustion apparatus.

## Abstract
Combustion apparatus includes a cylindrical horizontally extending ceramic combustion tube 50 enclosed at one end 52 and open at the opposite end 54 for receiving a combustion boat 70 carrying a sample 75 to be com busted for subsequent analysis. One end 82 of an externally mounted sample eduction tube 30 is rigidly secured to the combustion tube 50 and communicates with the interior space 85 near the enclosed end of the combustion tube. The opposite end of the eduction tube 30 is secured to the combustion tube by means of a slide assembly 35 to accommodate for differential movement between the com bustion tube and the eduction tube. A lance tube 90 also extends into the combustion tube for directing a flow of an oxidizing gas into the combustion boat to facilitate oxidation of a sample. The open end of the combustion tube is sealed by a curtain of gas supplied by a flood tube 100 . A baffle structure 62 is positioned between the combustion boat and gas exit to contain volatile samples during combustion.
