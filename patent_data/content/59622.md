# Alkali metal ferrates.

## Abstract
Alkali metal iron IV and iron VI ferrates are produced by the reaction at high temperatures of reactant mixtures of either a iron oxide and alkali metal oxide or peroxide or b elemental iron and alkali metal peroxide, wherein the reactions are conducted at least in their initial stages in the absence of free oxygen, e.g., in a vacuum or in an inert gas atmosphere.
