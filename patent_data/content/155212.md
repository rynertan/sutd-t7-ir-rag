# MAGNETIC BUBBLE MEMORY DEVICE

## Abstract
A magnetic bubble memory device comprises a bubble propagation path defined by a wide gap pattern. The bubble propagation path is defined by a pattern of elements 11, 12 each having an asymmetrically curved shape with an entran ce side segment 11a, 12a and an exit side segment 11b, 12b , the elements being arranged at a predetermined step P so that the exit side segment of one element is opposed to the entrace side segment of another element with a gap therebetween, and the difference h in lenght between the entrance side segment and the exit side segment of one ele ment being of 10 to 25 of the height H of the element. The geometry of the bubble propagation path is favourable for gaining an increase in density and providing a high propagation characteristic.
