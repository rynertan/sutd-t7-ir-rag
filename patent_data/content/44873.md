# APPARATUS FOR MEASURING AIR FLOW RATE USING HOT WIRE TYPE AIR FLOWMETER.

## Abstract
An apparatus for measuring air flow rate by using a hot wire type air flowmeter which compensates for error caused by backflow of air and thereby measures true intaken air flow rate. This apparatus includes a calculator 52 for integrating the out put from the hot wire air flowmeter and thereby calculating an apparent air flow rate Q
