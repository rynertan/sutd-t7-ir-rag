## Description
ENGINE This invention relates to engines. Most engines in use today operate on the principle of an expanding gaseous medium which causes movement of a movable device such as a piston, turbine rotor, or the like. This same principle is operative whether the engine is an internal combustion engine or an external combustion engine. The internal combustion engine burns a compressed air fuel mixture in an enclosed chamber so that the energy developed by the rapidly expanding gaseous, combustion products is converted into mechanical energy. The external combustion engine imparts thermal energy to an expandable, gaseous medium wiih the, gaseous medium being allowed to expand under controlled conditions in the engine thereby to convert the thermal energy to mechanical energy.The well known combustion engine utilizing steam for driving a plurality of pistons is known to include a double acting piston whereby each linear movement of the piston is a power stroke. The present invention provides a novel engine wherein the cylinder of the engine is configured as an annular cylinder having pairs of opposed pistons cooperating therein. The two pistons of each pair are interconnected by a curvilinear tie rod to one end of, a rocker arm, there being two such intersecting rocker arms pivotally mounted about a common axis. The rocker arms are joined by a crank apparatus to the gear system for the engine for converting the oscillatory movement of the rocker arms into a rotary motion in the gears. The engine of the invention is suitable for a two stroke, or four stroke internal combustion engine operation, b two stroke external combustion engine operation, or c in combination with a.compressor configuration. The invention will now be described in more detail, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a simplified, perspective view of a first embodiment of engine, configured as a diesel engine and shown with portions broken away to reveal internal construction features Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of a second embodiment of engine, configured as a two cycle engine, the cross sectional view being taken generally along lines A A of Figure 1 but with certain modifications therein to illustrate the two cycle features of this embodiment of the invention Figure 3 is a cross sectional view of a third embodiment of engine, configured as a four cycle engine, the cross sectional view being taken generally along lines A A of Figure 1 but with certain modifications therein to illustrate the four cycle features of this embodiment of the invention and Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of a fourth embodiment of engine, configured as a combination compressor two cycle internal combustion engine, the cross sectional view being taken generally along linesA A of Figure 1 but with certain modifications therein to illustrate the two cycle and air compressor features of this embodiment of the invention. With reference to each of Figures 1 4, the overall concept of the engine revolves around a double acting piston concept wherein pairs of pistons are mounted on each end of transecting rocker arms and cooperate in an annular cylinder. Rocker arms 12 and 14 are pivotally mounted on a shaft 29 and. respectively support pistons 21 28 on the ends 12a, 12b, 14a, and 14b thereof. In particular, pistons 21 and 22 are mounted on each end of a tie rod 16 mounted to end 12a of rocker arm 12.Correspondingly, pistons 23 and 24 are mounted on tie rod 17 17 secured to end 14a of rocker arm 14. Pistons 25 and 27 are mounted to tie rod 18 joined to end 12b of rocker arm 12 while pistons. 27 and 28 are mounted to the ends of tie rod 19 secured to end 14b of rocker arm 14.An annular cylinder 11 contains cylinder liners 36 39 so that coacting pairs of pistons form compression combustion chambers 31 34, respectively, therein.For example, pistons 21 and 28 cooperate in cylinder liner 36 to form combustion compression chamber 31. The same features are found for each of the remaining pistons 22 27, as will be clearly seen from each of Figures 1 4. Slots 1 84 in the internal side wall of annular cylinder 11 accommodate the oscillatory movement of the respective end of rocker arms 12 and 14. The appropriate oscillatory movement of rocker arms 12 and 14 correspondingly causes pistons 21 28 cooperatively to either decrease or increase the volume of each of combustion compression chambers 31 34. For example, movement of ends 12a and 14b towards each other brings piston 21 and piston 28 toward the center of combustion compression chamber 31, thereby compressing the compressible medium therein. Correspondingly, pistons 24 and 25 on the opposite side of annular cylinder 11 are brought toward each other with a corresponding compression of the volume of compression combustion chamber 33.While the foregoing event is taking place, pistons 22 and 23 are being moved apart, thus increasing the volume of compression combustion chamber.32, along with a corresponding movement of pistons 26 and 27 increasing the volume of combustion compression chamber 34.Reverse movement of rocker arms 12 and 14 reverses the foregoing procedure, causing a decrease in the volume of combustion compression chambers 32 and 34 while increasing the volume of combustion compression chambers 31 and 33. It can, therefore, be readily seen that each movement of rocker arms 12 and 14 in each direction is a power stroke if all four combustion compression chambers 31 34 are configured as expansion engine apparatus, whether internal or external combustion. Oscillatory movement of rocker arms 12 and 14 is translated into rotary motion by means of cranks 48 and 49 interconnected by side gears 46 and 47, respectively, to main gear 59. Each full, oscillatory cycle of the respective rocker arm 12 or 14 is thereby iranslated into one full rotation of side gear 46 and 47, respectively. Referrring now more particularly to Figure 2, the second preferred embodiment of the novel engine apparatus of this invention is shown generally at 20 and is configured as a two cycle, internal combustion engine. In particular, each of compression combustion chambers 31 34 are configured as internal combustion chambers having spark plugs 41 44, respectively, mounted therein. By two cycle operation, it is understood herein that the reverse movement of each of pistons 21 28 is a power expansion stroke wherein a fuel air mixture is appropriately ignited and combusted in combustion chambers 31 34. Correspondingly, each forward movement of pistons 21 28 in combination with the respective opposing piston serves as a compression stroke to compress a fuel air mixture in the respective combustion chambers 31 34. Intake and exhaust ports are provided through the walls of annular cylinder chamber 11 and therespective cylinder liners 36 39 therein. For example, intake ports 61 and 68 are provided for combustion chamber 31 while intake ports 62 and 63 provide intake for combustion chamber 32 intake ports 64 and 65 for combustion chamber 33 and intake ports 66 and 67 for combustion chamber 34. Each of intake ports 61 68 are selectively interconnected through intake plenum chambers 51 58, respectively, each of which is selectively connected to an intake header not shown by intake conduits 51a 58a, respectively. In operation, therefore, each pistons 21 28 operates substantially identical to piston 21 in that reverse movement of piston 21 exposes intake port 61 thereby allowing an appropriate fuel air mixture to be introduced from the intake header not shown through intake conduit Sla into intake plenum chamber 51 thence through intake port 61 into combustion chamber 31.Forward movement of piston 21 covers intake port 61 and commences the compression of the fuel air mixture thus obtained. Exhaust from combustion chamber 31 is discharged through exhaust ports 71 and 78 into exhaust plenum chamber 61 and vented through exhaust conduit 61a into an exhaust header not shown . Corresponding exhaust ports 72 and 73 discharge into exhaust plenum chamber 61 and through exhaust conduit 62a. Exhaust ports 74 and 75 discharge into exhaust plenum chamber 63 and exhaust conduit 63a. Exhaust ports 76 and 77 discharge into exhaust plenum chamber 64 and exhaust conduit 64a.Accordingly, during a power stroke, a fuel air mixture in combustion chamber 31, for example, is ignited at an appropriate time by a spark produced by spark plug 41 with the resulting increase in pressure forcing apart pistons 21 and 28, thereby transmitting the appropriate power through cranks 48 and 49 to side gears 46 and 47, respectively, and ultimately into main gear 59.Continued reverse movement of pistons 21 and 28 exposes exhaust ports 71 and 78, respectively, allowing the burned fuel air mixture to be discharged from combustion chamber 31. Continued rearward movement of pistons 21 and 28 exposes intake ports 61 and 68, respectively, accommodating the inrush of afresh charge of fuel air mixture with the initial portions of the fuel air mixture assisting in purging the exhaust products through exhaust ports 71 and 78, respectively. The identical procedure is being followed with respect to the various features associated with the diametrally opposed combustion chamber 33.The end of the power stroke centered around combustion chambers 31 and 33 is, simultaneously, the start of power stroke initiated in combustion chambers 32 and 34 so that rearward movement of the respective pistons, pistons 22 and 23 in combination with pistons 26 and 27, causes a forward movement of pistons 21 and 28 and also pistons 24 and 25.Forward movement of pistons 21 and 28 covers intake ports 61 and 68 and, subsequently, exhaust ports 71 and 78 with a resulting compression of the fresh, fuel air mixture therein. In addition to providing a power stroke with each oscillatory movement of rocker arms 12 and 14, the novel two cycle engine apparatus of this invention provides the additional advantage in that the end of each power stroke of one set of pistons is balanced by the compression encountered by the opposing pistons, thereby cushioning the same and assisting in the reverse movement of each of the respective sets of pistons. Referring now more particularly to Figure 3, a third preferred embodiment of the novel engine apparatus of this invention is shown generally at 30 and is configured as a four cycle, internal combustion engine.In particular, each of combustion chambers 31 34 incorporates therein a set of intake valves 91 94 and a set of exhaust valves 95 98 respectively. Intake valves 91 94 and exhaust valves 95 98 are operated by the appropriate, conventional valve actuation systems not shown operated by a cam driven valve lifter system not shown . At this point, it should be particularly understood that while a specified valve system is shown for the novel engine apparatus of this invention, it should be clearly understood that any suitable valve system could be incorporated into the novel engine apparatus and method of this invention. In operation and with reference particularly to combustion chamber 31, a power cycle is commenced by the ignition of a fuel air mixture in combustion chamber 31 by spark plug 41 igniting the fuel air mixture with the resultant explosion, forcing apart pistons 21 and 28.At the end of the power stroke and. prior to the forward movement of pistons 21 and 28, exhaust valve 98 is opened, allowing the exhaust products to be discharged from combustion chamber 31. At the end of the forward movement of pistons 21 and 28 and prior to their reverse movement apart, exhaust valve 98 is closed and intake valve 91 is opened allowing a fresh fuel air mixture to enter combustion chamber 31. At the end of reverse movement of pistons 21 and 28, intake valve 91 is closed so that as pistons 21 and 28 move toward each other, the fuel air mixture in combustion chamber 31 is compressed.Upon reaching the end of travel for pistons 21 and 28, a spark, as suitably timed for the speed of operation, etc., as is conventional, from spark plug 41 initiates combustion of the same, commencing the power stroke. The power thus generated is transmitted to rocker arms 12 and 14 and translated into rotary motion by cranks 48 and 49, respectively, and transmitted by side gears 46 and 47 to main gear 59. While each of opposed combustion chamber pairs, combustion chambers 31 and 33, as opposed to combustion chambers 32 and 34, may be paired so as to both operate on the same intake, compression, expansion and exhaust cycles, the opposing combustion chambers and valve systems may be configured so as to be directly out of phase with the opposing combustion chamber. For example, while combustion chamber 31 is in the expansion power stroke mode, combustion chamber 33 would be in the intake mode.. Simultaneously, combustion chamber 32 would be in the exhaust mode while combustion chamber 34 would be in the compression mode of operation.Accordingly, since there are four combustion chambers, combustion chambers 1 34, each combustion chamber would be selectively timed so as to fire sequentially, thereby substantially smoothing out the overall operation of four cycle engine apparatus 30. With additional reference to Figure 3, the elimination of each of spark plugs 41 44 and the appropriate modification of intake valves 91 94 and exhaust valves 95 98 could readily adapt four cycle engine apparatus 30 as an external combustion engine apparatus. In particular, intake ports 91 94 would now be configured so that an expansion fluid such as steam may be injected therethrough at the appropriate portion of the cycle as the respective pistons 21 28 are at their point of closest proximity. The resulting expansion would drive apart the respective pistons causing the appropriate movement of rocker arms 12 and 14. Correspondingly, as the pistons are moved together, the appropriate exhaust ports 95 98 are opened, allowing the spent steam to be discharged therethrough. Thereafter, discharge valve 95 is closed and intake valve 91 is opened and the cycle repeated. Accordingly, by this simple modification of four cycle engine apparatus 30, an external combustion engine apparatus is readily provided from what was previously considered as an internal combustion engine apparatus. Referring now more particularly to Figure 4, a combination two cycle, internal combustion engine compressor apparatus is shown generally at 40 and includes combustion chambers 31 and 33 on opposite sides thereof with compression chambers 32 and 34 in place of the previous internal combustion chambers. In operation, each of internal combustion chambers 31 and 33 is operated as conventional, two cycle internal combustion engine apparatus involving the appropriate intake and exhaust ports and fuel ignition as set forth herein before with respect to the two cycle engine apparatus 20 shown in Figure 2. The major difference is that compression chambers 32 and 34 are configured as compressor chambers with intake valves 92 and 94 and exhaust valves 96 and 98.Accordingly, during a power stroke from each of combustion chambers 31 and 33, the corresponding pistons 22 and 23 compress a gaseous mixture in compression chamber 32 while corresponding pistons 26 and 27 compress the gaseous medium in compression chamber 34. Toward the end of the compression stroke, exhaust valves 96 and 98, respectively, are opened, allowing the compressed air to be discharged into the high pressure system not shown . During the reverse stroke, exhaust valves 96 and 98 are closed while intake valves 92 and 94 are opened so that air is drawn into the particular compression chamber. In the alternative, the Figure 4 embodiment may be modified so that the combustion chambers are separated 0 by 90 rather than being diametrically opposite, for example chambers 31 and 34 are combustion chambers and each are provided with fuel ignition means and appropriate intake and exhaust ports. The compression chambers are then also separated by 900, for example chambers 32 and 33, and are configured with similar intake valves and exhaust valves. It should be readily noted, therefore, with respect to each of the embodiments of the novel engine apparatus of this invention that the novel structure thereof is readily adaptable to numerous configurations for either of diesel, two cycle, four cycle, external combustion, or compressor operations, as may be desired. Referring now more particularly to Figure 1, another preferred embodiment of the novel engine apparatus of this invention is shown generally at 10.Engine apparatus 10 is shown in perspective and is specifically configured for operations as a diesel engine in that fuel injection is provided through fuel injectors 101 104 into the appropriate combustion chambers. Overall, however, the valving system may be provided either as a two cycle engine apparatus utilizing intake valves 61 68 and exhaust valve 71 78 Figure 2 or as a four cycle system utilizing intake valves 91 95 and exhaust valves 95 98 Figure 3 .Regardless of the particular valving system and whether a two cycle engine or a four cycle engine, the diesel engine apparatus 10 of this particular embodiment incorporates fuel injector systems 101 104 and may be supplemented with an appropriate glow plug or spark plug, such as spark plugs 41 44 Figures 2 and 3 .In either embodiment, power transmitted to shaft 29 by main gear 59 is directed through gear housing 105 into transmission differential 106 with the power being directed to shafts 107 and 108. In the particular illustrated embodiment herein, shafts 107 and 108 are shown as axles for a front drive vehicle. However, only one shaft, shaft 107 and 108, need be utilized for other applications. In the event both shafts 107 and 108 provide power to a front drive vehicle, transmission differential 106 provides the necessary gearing arrangement and differential characteristics to accommodate such an application. The entire structure of engine apparatus 10 is enclosed in an engine housing 100, the engine housing serving also as a support bearing surface for cranks 48 and 49. A take off pulley 111 is provided on shaft 29 and drives a belt 110 to drive the appropriate auxiliary equipment not shown , as is conventional. The invention may be embodied in other specific forms, and the described embodiments are to be considered only as illustrative.
