# Method and apparatus for fiberizing meltable materials.

## Abstract
The high velocity gradients associated with the shear layer or boundary layer of a supersonic gas stream, especial ly the potential core thereof, are applied to form fibers of a melted material projected across such gradients. Optimiza tion of the effects of such gradients is sought by sustaining the magnitude of the gradients as long as possible by minimizing shear layer growth rate and or stabilizing the rate of vortex formation, and by synchronizing the rate of projection of melt with the rate of vortex production. Provisions such as vortex triggering or density loading are made for reducing the shear layer growth rate. Provisions are also made for intermittently feeding melt at a rate synchronized with the rate of vortex formation. Provisions for regulating the temperature in the shear layer are made such as appropriately controlling stagnation gas tempera ture, causing an exothermal reaction within the gas stream, or causing combustion of the gas stream within an oxygen containing fiberization chamber.
