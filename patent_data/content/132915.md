# Method of preparing solid adsorbent for unsaturated hydrocarbon and process for separation of unsaturated hydrocarbon from gas mixture.

## Abstract
A solid adsorbent for an unsaturated hydrocarbon com prising a i a copper I halide or oxide or ii a halide, carbox ylate, sulfate, basic salt, oxide, or ammine complex salt of copper II and b activated carbon or graphite. This solid adsorbent can effectively adsorb an unsatu rated hydrocarbon such as ethylene from a gas mixture by being placed in contact with the gas mixture therewith at a temperature of 40 C to 90 C under normal pressures.
