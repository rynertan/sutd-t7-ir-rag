# PISTON PUMP SERVO CONTROL

## Abstract
An electronic closed loop piston pump servo control sys tem including a swash plate within the pump housing which controls pump output as a function of its position about a rotational axis, means for altering the position of said swash plate, means for producing electric signals representative of the desired and actual swash plate angular positions and means for comparing these signals and producing a control or error signal to the means for altering the swash plate position as a function of these signal differences. The means for pro ducing electric signals representative of the actual swash plate position includes a rotary potentiometer mounted in the pump housing and directly connected to the swash plate along a common axis of rotation. This potentiometer pro duces a d.c. signal indicating the angular position of the swash plate on this common axis. A failsafe circuit is provided in the comparator means which prevents the error signal from affecting the swash plate angular position if the feedback signal falls below a predetermined reference level. The poten tiometer rotates through a relatively small arc such that when the sliding resistive contacts thereon are worn, the poten tiometer contacts may be rotated to respond along a fresh arc.
