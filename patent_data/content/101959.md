## Description
SWI1JS GATES This invention relates to apparatus for the handling of flowable solid materials, hereinafter referred to as particulate materials. It relates more specifically to improved gate structure for controlling the flow from such apparatus. Apparatus for controlling the flow of particulate materials normally comprises inwardly converging wall structure defining a throat opening at the lower end thereof, and into which the particulate material is funnelled by the wall structure. Within the throat there is normally located a movable gate for controlling the flow of particulate material through the gate. The apparatus may further comprise superior wall structure to define a containing hopper, and the ensuing description is made with reference to hoppers. however, it should be appreciated that such term is intended to cover apparatus wherein particulate materials are merely piled above a throat without being contained by a superior wall structure. Various types of gates are known, particularly for use with very large hoppers which may, for example, form a ship s hold, and amongst which may be exemplified roller gates and basket gates.It is well knawn that certain types of particulate material will not flow freely thus it is found that certain materials, especially where they comprise large lumps, are prone b arch formation in the throat area. Other types of materials, especially fine, oheesive powdery materials, tend to block together, resulting in the formation of rat holes, arches or bridges. Various expedients have hitherto been adopted or proposed for prompting the flow of particulate materials. Mechanical expedients comprise vibrators or movable members. Whilst certain of these have been found to be more or less suitable for use with specific particulate materials, others have not been found acceptable, primarily due to econcmic factors. size expedients may be combined with, or even supplanted by non mechanical expedients, for example by coating the funnel wall structure to reduce frictional drag, and increasing the flow velocity through the throat opening in the so called bulk flow gate, whereby the energy of the mowing material serves to break incipient arch and rat hole formation. However, the bulk flow gate engenders certain difficulty in containing and controlling the material flowing from the hoeeer. It is then an object of this invention to provide hoppers with improved flow control means. It is a further object of this invention to provide hoppers with relatively Inexpensive structure for promoting flow through the funnel wall structure of the hopper. It is a further object of this invention to provide a means for economically convErting existing hoppers so as to provide therein improved flow control. It is a still further object of this invention to provide a hopper wherein the flow rate therefrom may be variable fran very high, bulk flow rate to low flow rates. In a xxnoiance with one aspect of my invention a hopper for the handling of particulate materials comprises at least one gate for closing at least a portion of the throat opening of the hogpes, and nans for mounting the one gate whereby as that gate moves towards its open position a forward end thereof describes an arcuate path above the general level of the throat opening, which is to say within the confines of the funnel wall or thereabove, thereby digging, striking, disturbing or otherwise breaking up particulate material folning the wall of a rat hole, arch or bridge and prorating the recommencement of flow of material, means being provided for actuating the one gate. Normally, and particularly in large ers, a contiguous portion of the throat opening will be closed by at least one other neighbouring gate, and the arcuate path will desirably locate at least in part above the contiguous portion means is further provided for operating the neighbouring gate preferably independently of the one gate. Assuming then the neighbouring gate to be opened and an arch or the like to have formed thereabove, the one gate may be opened, or further opened if already part opened so as to more are the neighbouring gate opening and break the wall of the arch thereby promoting flow through the neighbouring gate. The arcuate path travelled by the one gate may vary appreciably in accordance with the means of mounting the gate.Expediently the gate may be mounted fran one or more pivots defining a pivot axis. In accordance with another aspect of the invention the pivot axis locates generally above the throat opening of the whopper, and the one gate, which may be termed a swing gate, connects thereto by a link. Cbnveniently the link is in the form of first and second members which connect respectively to the swing gate adjacent the forward and rearward ends thereof. Expediently each comprises a pair of laterally spaced apart arms. The arms of the second member, that is to say the rearward member, may w connect to the pivot axis either internally or externally of the hopper.In accordance with this aspect the swing gate moves through a circular path about the pivot axis, and the degree of overlap of the contiguous portion of the throat opening will vary according to the location of the pivot axis relative to the swing gate in its closed position. It will also be appreciated that the location of the pivot axis will largely determine whether the swing gate will move towards an open or closed position under the influence of the hopper load. Generally speaking it is preferred that a single pivot axis be offset slightly fran the axial centre of the swing gate towards the one end, whereby the swing gate has a tendency to move towards a slightly opened position but wherein the gate, when in its fully open position will have adequate penetration within the hopper whilst not unduly constricting the throat opening. Preferably the pivot axis will locate vertically above a transverse line which locates within the range of about 40 to 50 percent of the axial length of the swing gate, taken from the forward end thereof. It is contemplated that the effective penetration of the swing gate within the hopper may be increased by appendages which mount from the swing gate or the forwardly located link members. In accordance with a still 6 aspect of the invention, the swing gate may be mounted fran one or more other pivots defining a second pivot axis, and connected thereto by a second link. Normally the second pivot axis locates below the throat opening, the second link connecting to the rearward end of the gate by a hinge commection. In such embodiment the first and second ends of the gate define different circular arcs.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The invention will be further described in relation to certain specific embodiments thereof, taken in conjunction with the acoomçanying drawings. Fig. 4 locates on the first sheet thereof, preceding the sheets containing Figs 2 and 3. In the drawings FIG. 1 shows in part transverse section a hopper incorprating an improved gate according to the invention, together with an underlaying conveyor such as may be used with large hoppers FIG. 2 shows the view of Fig. 1 taken along 2 2 FIG. 3 is similar to 2 2 but taken in perspective and part broken away to reveal detail FIG. 4 is similar to Fig. 1, but show a different gate arrangement FIG. 5 is a view of the embodiment at of Fig. 4 similarly taken to Fig. 3, andFIG. 6 is a similar view to Fig. 2, but shows a still further embodiment.FIG. 7 and 8 are similar to Figs. 1 and 2 respectively, but show additional reaching extensions which increase the effectiveness of the gates.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS Referring now to Figs 1, 2 and 3 in detail, the lower, convergent and laterally spaced apart walls of a hopper are irdicated by the numeral 10, distal portions thereof being downturned at ll to form a throat opening 12 at the bottan of the hopper. The hopper is axially elongated, such as may comprise the hopper of a self unloading ship whilst the throat opening 12 may be mare or less continuous substantially along the length of the whopper, it is here considered to be interrupted at intervals by hog backs 14 as are commonly ettployed in conjunction with roller track gates or basket gates for controlling flow fran the hopper.A conveyor in the form of an endless belt 16 locates beneath throat opening 12 in axial alignment therewith, such conveyor not forming part of the invention however. Conveyor belt 16 is considered to travel from right to left inFig. 2. The gate installation typified by Fig. 2 is one such as may be provided in converting a roller track gate hopper system of an existing ship s hopper to a gate system in accordance with the instant invention. In such conerrsion the existing upstream gate, with reference to the movement of conveyor belt 12, and shown here as a roller track gate 18, is here left substantially undisturbed. The remaining portion of throat opening 12 is gated in accordance with the improved swing gates 20,21 of the invention. Since swing gates 20,21 are identical, only the one will be particularly described and referred to, except where the context requires otherwise. Swing gate 20 comprises a floor 24 and lateral walls 26 upstanding therefran so as to nest within hopper wall portions 11 so as to form a closure therebetween. A gate support bar 28 is anchored to lateral hopper walls 10 to span therebetween above each swing gate 20, support bar 28 being strengthened by gussets 27.Gate 20 is linked to pivot support bar 28 at coaxial pivots 29 by a first part of laterally spaced arms 30 which connect rigidly to gate floor 24 adjacent the upstream, or forward end 32 of the gate floor, which is here that end adjacent roller track gate 18, and a second pair of laterally spaced arms 34 which connect rigidly to the gate floor 24 adjacent the other axial end 36 thereof. The axially opposed ends of arms 30,34 are interconnected with snall upstanding walls 37 which tend to stiffen floor 24 in the axial direction. A transverse, tubular member 38 is rigidly secured to gate floor 24 adjacent gate end 36 on the underside thereof so as to extend laterally beyond the distal edges of hopper wall portion 11 beneath throat 12.Hydraulic actuators 40 connect between each end of tubular member 38 and hopper wall 10 or any point fixed relative thereto.Actuators 40 are seen in dotted outline in Fig. 2, that associated with swing gate 21 being shown in its extended position wherein the swing gate is closed, that associated with swing gate 20 being shown only in its contracted, open gate position for clarity.Separate hydraulic control lines 42,44 are provided for independently actuating the hydraulic actuators 40 associated with swing gates 20,21 respectively. A similar control line not shown is provided for independently actuating roller track gate 18, no particular actuating means being here illustrated, however. Whilst it is preferable that the operation of one gate be independent of that of its neighbours, it will be appreciated that the operation of non neighbouring gates may be inter linked without serious detriment, and the ganged operation of adjacent gates is not precluded. Axial sealing between throat opening 12 and gate 20 is provided in the manner previously spoken of, that is to say the upstanding walls 26 of swing gate 20 nesting closely within hopper wall portion 1l of throat opening 12. Transverse sealing is provided by stops 48 which secure to wall portions U so as to abut closely the first axial end 32 of a one gate and the other end 36 of the adjacent gate. The forward end portion 32 of swing gate 20 is upwardly defonted, preferably being radiused on pivot 29, although this is conveniently approximated by one or more chords in the manner generally illustrated. Stop 48 then conveniently underlays a one end of floor 24 and overlays the other end of the adjacent gate. The upwardly deformed end 32 of gate 20 generally stiffens that end of the gate, end 34 being stiffened by tubular member 38. Mbre importantly, it is found that the generally upturned end 32 of floor 24 facilitates the movement of swing gate 20 through the material contained in the hopper. Actuation of hydraulic actuators 40 of swing gate 20 or 21 causes the gate to move about pivot 29 on a circular arc, the forward end 32 of the gate being drawn upwardly into the stored material. The locus of end 32 will depend upon the position of pivot 29 in relation to the gate opening. Generally pivot 29 will locate intermediate the ends 32,36 of swing gate 20,the radius of the locus being such that as the swing gate moves to its fully opened position, i.e. the position assumed by gate 20 inFig. 2, gate 21 being shown in its closed position, forward end 32 moves in vertical planes above the opening of the adjacent gate, here roller track gate 18.The precise position of pivot 29 is not critical, but it will be appreciated that the actual position somewhat influences the characteristics of swing gate 20. Thus where pivot 29 locates off the axial center, towards rearward end 36 of the swing gate, the gate will tend to be normally shut, vertical penetration within the hopper increased and axial overlap of the adjacent gate decreased. Conversely, as the pivot 29 locates towards the forward end 32 of the swing gate, the gate tends to be normally open, the vertical penetration decreases and the axial overlap increases.Generally speaking, it is preferred that the axis of pivot 29 locate with the range of about 40 to 50 percent of the axial length of swing gate 20 from the forward end thereof, whereby a suitable balance between the above factors is obtained, and also whereby the swing gate when in its fully opened position least obstructs the throat opening. The effective penetration of a swing gate within the hcpper may be increased by the simple expedient of providing one or more appendages which may be in the form of protuberances as seen at 50 on forward portions of gate 20. Having described the general mechanical principles of the embodiment of Figs 1, 2 and 3, the operation thereof will be described. In the ensuing discussion, reference to gate 20 is intended to differentiate from gate 21. Generally speaking, in unloading the hopper, the upstream gate will first be opened, such gate here comprising roller track gate 18. Assuming flow therethrough to become stopped or reduced through rat hole or arch formation, the actuation of the adjacent gate, here gate 20, will break out the wall of the rat hole or the arch, and the flow through gate 18 will recommence.Where it is desired to increase the flow from the hopper, gates 18 and 20 may be opened simultaneously. TD sane extent arches may form to bridge across gate 18 onto forward end 32 of gate 20 such arch formation may be broken by closing gate 20, so as to restart flow through gate 18.Rat hole formation will not be likely with both gates 18 and 20 open, but should it occur it can we broken by actuation of swing gate 21 in the same meaner as swing gate 20 as earlier described. where it it is desired to increase flow from the hopper still further, gates 18,20 and 21 may each be opened. Rat hole formation and arch formation beeeee less probable in that instance because of the increased dimension of the opening in the axial direction and because the flow rate in the funnel section and throat of the hopper tends to increase disproportionately with the opening size. It will be remarked that swing gates 20 function as chutes to direct material flow fran the hopper in an orderly manner onto conveyor belt 16 and provide such material with a velocity component in the direction of the motion of the belt.This action is quite unlike that found with basket gates and buIk flow gates, and leads to considerably less wear and tear upon both the belt and its supporting structure. It is further found that less spillage fran the conveyor belt 16 results from the use of swing gates in part this is due to the axially aligned walls ccmprising lateral walls 26 and walls 37 which connect between the opposed arm mEmbers 30,34 which function b reduce the lateral velocity oamponent of material induced by conveyor walls 10. Other axially aligned walls may be found advantageous in reducing spillage still further. It will be appreciated that the first embodiment is described particularly in relation to the possible conversion of an existing hopper and gate structure. Whilst in such embodiment three gates in end to end relationship were illustrated, the invention is not restricted to any particular number of gates. Considering now the erbodir.ent of Figs 4 and 5, parts which are identical or functionally similar to those of the first embodiment will be referenced similarly in the hundred series. A hopper having convergent side walls 110 downwardly turned at 111 to form a throat 112 is provided with a plurality of swing gates 120 in end to end relationship to close throat 112. Each said swing gate comprises a floor 124 and upstanding lateral walls 126 extending along the side thereof. A gate support bar 128 spans between hopper walls 110, and is linked to gate 120 by a forward pair of laterally spaced arms 130 at coaxial pivots 129, defining a pivot axis, arms 130 being rigidly attached to floor 124 as by welding adjacent the forward end 132 thereof.Support bar 128 is strengthened by gusset supports 127,and floor 124 is strengthened by axially aligned wall 137 which wall also serves to reduce transverse movement of material unloaded fran the hopper much in the same manner as walls 37 function in the prior discussed embodiment. A tubular member 138 secures to the floor 124 of gate 120 on the underside of rearward end 136 to extend laterally beond the walls Ul of throat 112. The rearward end 136 of swing gate 120 is linked externally to the hopper to pivot 129a by laterally spaced arms 134 which connect rigidly to tubular member 138.Pivot 129a is cOllinfAr with pivot 129 and is mounted externally to the hopper by mounting blocks 139 which secure to walls 1l0 equally gate support bar 128 may be made to project externally to the hopper so as to provide a support for pivots 129a if desired. Hydraulic actuators 140 connect between hopper wall 1l0 and rearward arms 134, separate control lines not shown being provided for the independent actuation of neighbuuring swing gate. Since pivots 129, 192a locate on a capon pivot axis, it will be appreciated that the rswement of swing gate 120 is along the arc of a circle, centred on the pivot axis, and that the position thereof will control the movement thereof in precisely the same manner as in the first discussed embodiment. Turning now to the embodiment of Fig. 6, a hopper having wall structure essentially as earlier described and comprising convergent walls 210 with downwardly dependent wall portions 211 defining a throat opening 212 is closed by swing gates 220 constructed in accordance with earlier defined principles.Swing gates 220 are mounted to pivot about a first pivot axis defined by pivot 229 and a second pivot axis defined by pivot 229a parallel thereto but spaced therefrom. Gate support bar 228 locates above throat 212, and is conveniently supported from hamper walls 210, the forward end 232 of swing gate 220 being linked to support bar 228 at pivots 229. Pivot 229a locates externally to the hopper, and is supported fran blocks 231 which secure to an eIeeent fixed in relation to the hoeeer. The link between swing gate 220 and support bar 228 comprises a pair of forward, laterally spaced arms 230 which hingedly connect adjacent the forward end 232 of the swing gate at hinge point 233.Similarly the link between swing gate 220 and blocks 231 comprises a pair of rearward, laterally spaced arms 234 mounted on coaxial pivots 229a and which hingedly connect at hinge points 235 to transverse tubular member 238 secured. to swing gate 220 adjacent the rearward end thereof. Hydraulic actuators 240 connect at one end thereof to rearward arms 234 and at the other end to an element fixed in relation to the hopper. A modified means is shown here for effecting a seal between adjacent swing gates, caprising a flat bar stop 248, the lower edge of which contacts the rearward end of one gate and the forward end of an adjacent gate. Arch formation in the material being unloaded may occur laterally, so as to bridge across opposed hopper walls 10, or longitudinally, for example between a hog back 14 and an adjacent gate support bar 28, or between adjacent support bars, although the latter type of arch is relatively unstable due to the small surface area of support bars 28. At times also, dame formation of the material may result where there is a bridging support from both lateral and transverse walls within the hopper. Such bridging formations may be collectively referred to as arch formations. The radius of the arch formation will vary according to the nature of the material being unloaded, being influenced by such factors as particle size, particle shape and moisture content. For those arch formations locating below the horizontal level of pivot points 29 or thereabouts, swing gates such as 20 are useful in breaking the arches to promote flow through the gates.Where the arch formation is above the horizontal level of pivot points 29, reaching exten5icns such as is illustrated sat schematically as 50 and earlier discussed may be of assistance in reaching into the arch to break and dislodge the material. In Figs. 7 and 8 there is illustrated a further means of breaking and dislodging arch formations. Here a reaching extension formed by arms 60 is supported fran rearward arms 34 of gate 20 to project upwardly and rearwardly thereof. The vertical height of extension arm 60, when the gate is in the closed position, should be greater than that of the arch formation, identified in Fig. 7 by the letter A , to be dislodged thereby. The actual dimensions of arms 60 will normally be such as to preclude the arms fran striking an adjacent gate or hog back 14 as the gate moves to its fully opened position, although it may be preferred for certain materials which are prone to arch formation for arm 60 be extended upwardly and the arc through which gate 20 may swing be correspondingly limited.Of course, I do not preclude variable height arms 60, althcugh the environment of use does not readily lend itself towards fragile or sophisticated mechanisms. The stress upon gate 20 and its associated mounting means is reduced where the members movable through the particulate material are either radially disposed on pivot 29, or where they form part of a circular arc thereabout, or less preferably a chord. of such arc. Distal portions 62 of arm 60 are therefore disposed on a radius of pivot 29.The distal ends of arms 60 support shart, lateral digging mEmbers 64, which arc to break away portions of the arch formation as the gate 20 is moved between open and closed positions, laterally opposed arms 60 together effectively Qittin,g out a keystone, shown in Fig. 7 in dotted outline and identified by the letter K , in the crown of the arch formation to cause the arch formation to collapse. Arm 60 will also assist in promoting an initial flow of particulate material through throat opening 12 as gate 20 is moved to its open position, as the arms rotate towards the throat opening, thereby acting to positively expels the particulate material through the throat opening and break up any incipient arch formation. The foregoing embodiments are exemplary only of the inven tion, particularly in its broad aspects, and they are not intended to be limitative thereof. Indeed many variations therefrom will occur to persons skilled in the art so as to achieve one or more ends, objectives and advantages as are put forward herein. Whilst the illustrative embodiments relate particularly to very large installations utilizable with conveyors for off loading and the terms forward end and rearward end of the gate have particular meaning in relation to the direction of travel of the belt, in their broader sense the forward of any swing gate will be leading and of the gate as the gate is opened.
