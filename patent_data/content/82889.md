# Method and arrangement for local address acquisition by a station in a communication system.

## Abstract
In a local communication network, stations can be attached via extension lines and individual ports in distribution panels to the main transmission ring 11 . Each port has a physical address or local identification key. Means are provided for inserting the local key of a port into a station when it is plugged into the extension lines. Each station comprises units 33, 45 for generating a key demand signal and an idling signal pattern which are transmitted to the port, and a key register 47 for recording the key when it is received. Each port includes a read only store and timing unit 41 which furnishes the local key in response to the received idling pattern which is converted to a clock signal. A switch 37 in the port is activated by a switch control unit 35 to insert the read only store and timing unit into a wrap around loop interconnecting input and output paths of the station.
