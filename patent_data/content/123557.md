# Flexible ferromagnetic marker for the detection of objects having markers secured thereto.

## Abstract
A marker adapted to be used with cloth or fabric articles to enable the detection thereof in an electromagnet article sur veillance system within which the marker generates a detect able signal related to an alternating electromagnetic field applied within an interrogation zone, wherein the marker comprises an elongated strip of amorphous ferromagnetic ribbon sealed on all major surfaces within flexible polymeric cover layers having a low rate of water vapor transmission, and a high degree of thermal stability, puncture resistance and conformability, such that the articles having the marker included therein may be subjected to repeated flexing and high temperature and humidity conditions such as encoun tered in commercial laundry operations without affecting the magnetic properties of the marker, while also not appreciably stiffening the article itself, thus being readily attached to or concealed therein.
