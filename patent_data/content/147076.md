# Electrical terminal having a receptacle contact section of low insertion force and terminating section therefor.

## Abstract
An electrical terminal comprises a receptacle contact section 3 having cantilever contact members 9, 10 extend ing from a bottom wall 5 at forward and rear ends of the contact section, the contact members 9, 10 extend toward an upper wall 6 and free ends 9a, 10a of the contact members 9, 10 overlap and are spaced from each other so that, upon initial insertion of a matable contact 30 into the contact section 3 , a low insertion force is encountered and the insertion force increases gradually in proportion to the depth of insertion of the matable contact 30 due to engagement between the overlapping free ends 9a, 10a of the contact members 9, 10 so that a high contact pressure is obtained at the complete insertion of the matable contact 30 in the receptacle contact section 3 .
