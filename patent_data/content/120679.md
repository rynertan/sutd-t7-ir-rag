# APPARATUS FOR ENCODING AND DECODING VIDEO SIGNALS

## Abstract
A first video signal is provided comprising a plurality of lines of a luminance signal, a first colour signal and a second colour signal, each of the lines having a duration of a first predetermined time. Each of the non overlapping pairs of successive lines of the luminance signal are summed and differenced to provide a luminance sum signal and a lumin ance difference signal. Each of the non overlapping pairs of successive lines of the first colour signal and also of the second colour signal are summed to provide a first colour sum signal and a second colour sum signal. The luminance difference signal, the first colour sum signal and the second colour sum signal are bandwidth limited in relation to the luminance sum signal. Corresponding lines of these signals are time compressed to the same bandwidth and then time multiplexed to form a corresponding line of a first compound signal, each line of which has a duration of the aforemen tioned predetermined time, and alternate lines of which have zero amplitude. A second video signal is similarly processed to provide a second compound signal. The first and second compound signals are interleaved to form a third compound signal such that the time of the non zero amplitude of the second com pound signal occupies the time when the first compound signal has zero amplitude. A carrier is modulated in amplitude by the third compound signal for transmission to a receiving station. The bandwidth of the modulated carrier is compar able to the bandwidth of a carrier that is amplitude modulated by one of the video signals. The carrier is demodulated at the receiving station to recover the third compound signal. The first or second compound signal is recovered from the third compound signal. Inverse operations are utilized to recover the first or second video signals.
