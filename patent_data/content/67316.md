# DIGITAL SCAN CONVERTER FOR VIDEO SIGNALS

## Abstract
Digital scan converter for transforming into a standard television signal an input video signal having different scanning characteristics. It includes an analogue to digital converter 2 supplied with the input signal and driving a main memory 8 as determined by a write address gener ator 27 . The main memory drives an output digital to analogue converter 13 as determined by a read address generator 37 . A multiplexer 9 alternately connects the address generators with memory 8 according to a clock signal. A FIFO memory 4 stores data from converter 2 at the scanning rate of the input signal and supplies them to the main memory at the clock signal rate. If the input signal scanning is other than a cartesian scanning, memory 8 is written by columns and read by rows. A couple of parallel connected FIFO memories 11, 12 alternately connect the main memory to converter 13 and supply the output data with a timing which is variable in order to restore the input signal.
