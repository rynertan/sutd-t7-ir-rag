# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING A THIN PLATE OF A HIGH FERROSILICON ALLOY.

## Abstract
A ferroalloy containing more than 4 by weight of silicon is produced by casting thin pieces. The manufacturing conditions consist of quickly coagulating the ferroalloy from the molten state at a cooling rate of greater than 1 C sec but less than 10⁵⁰C sec. A thin cast piece which is obtained is subjected to hot rolling reduction of 30 or more at a temperature of 600 C to 800 C. After being washed with acid, the cast piece is cold rolled to a desired thickness. The above manufacturing techniques permit the cast piece to be cold rolled on an industrial scale without developing cracks. After cold rolling. the cast piece is annealed so as to exhibit excellent magnetic properties.
