# Current circuit monitoring.

## Abstract
Electrical circuitry for monitoring the current flow through resistance elements LI LIV on the leading edge of an aircraft wing or horizontal stabilizer. The resistance elements are indicidually and sequentally activated for heating to thereby effect a de icing or anti icing function. The non activated elements are sensed by the circuitry to determine inferentially if there is a predetermined current flow through the heating elements to achieve the intended de icing or anti icing function.
