# MIXING FLUIDS BY MEANS OF SEMIPERMEABLE MEMBRANES

## Abstract
Methods for mixing fluids in a filter member including a filtration membrane are disclosed. The methods include supplying a first fluid through an inlet to one side of the filtration membrane, supplying a second fluid through a second inlet to that same side of the filtration membrane, and withdrawing the mixture of those fluids from the other or filtrate side of the filtration membrane through a fluid outlet. The method has particular application in the medical field, such as in connection with the mixing of blood components and related fluids.
