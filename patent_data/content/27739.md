# Process for producing mesophase pitch and process for producing carbon fibers.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a process for producing a mesophase pitch, which includes the steps of heating a precursor material under pressure, thereafter heating the material under atmos pheric pressure with sparging. There is also disclosed a pro cess for producing carbon fiber from the mesophase pitch produced in accordance with the invention which comprises spinning the mesophase pitch into a pitch fiber, and carboniz ing the pitch fiber. Preferably the pitch fiber is thermoset between spinning and carbonizing.
