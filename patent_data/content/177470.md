# A tube and a method and a device for manufacturing of the tube.

## Abstract
A packaging tube of the laminate type having dead fold characteristics, comprising a body of a metal foil containing laminate and a tube breast arranged at one end of the body, and an elongated strip of a metal foil containing laminate attached to the tube body and extending generally along the entire length thereof. The metal contents of the strip provides dead fold and the thickness of the metal foil of the tube body falls within the interval 5 to 40 microns and is selected such that it is considerably thinner than the thickness of the metal foil of the strip which falls within the interval 40 to 200 microns. Such arrangement allows a minimum of metal foil thickness in the tube body, meaning that the body foil thickness basically may be maintained at a gas and vapor barrier level. The tube body has a longitudinal joint covered by said strip generally along the entire length thereof.
