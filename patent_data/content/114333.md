## Description
pHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION Glaucoma is an ocular disease complex associated with an elevated pressure within the eye i.e., intraocular pressure, IOP . As a result of the elevated IOP, damage to the optic nerve head resulting in irreversible loss of visual function may ensue. Untreated, this condition may eventually lead to blindness. Ocular hypertension, i.e., the condition of elevated intraocular pressure without optic nerve head damage or characteristic glaucomatous visual field loss, is now believed by the majority of ophthalmologists to represent the earliest phase in the onset of glaucoma. A number of the drugs presently employed to treat glaucoma are not entirely satisfactory, particularly in the earliest course of the disease when the side effects they produce are often worse than the symptoms of the disease. Epinephrine used as a topical solution, must be utilized cautiously in patients with high blood pressure, diabetes, hyperthyroidism and cerebral artereosclerosis due to the possibility of systemic action. Timolol, a clinically utilized, topically applied agent for lowering intraocular pressure, must be used with caution in patients in whom be.fa adrenergic blockade may be undesirable. Systemic absorption of topically administered timolol and systemic beta blockade are responsible for the contraindication of timolol therapy for gluacoma in patients with compromised pulmonary function. Pilocarpine, a topical drug, although considered systemically harmless and quite effective, may cause considerable local difficulties. Pupil constriction may cause the eye to lose its ability to adapt from light to dark. Accomodation may become stimulated so that the patient s refraction is sometimes incorrect and vision becomes blurred. The drug itself may cause a local vasodilation and red eyes. Irritation is common. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors have been used systemically but they have a number of disadvantages.While effective in lowering intraocular pressure, they often cause a numbness and tingling, gastrointestinal upsets and, frequently, depression, lethargy, a loss of appetite, and general malaise. European PatentApplication 81400326.5, Publication number 36,351 attempts to overcome these difficulties by the topical administration of an alkali metal salt of a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. The presnet invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for reducing and controlling the elevated intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma. The invention sought to be patented in its pharmaceutical composition aspect is a topical ophthalmologically acceptable composition useful for reducing and controlling the elevated intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma which comprises an intraocular pressure reducing effective amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitor in combination with an ophthalmologically acceptable carrier for topical use. The composition may contain one or more additional therapeutic agents. In a preferred composition according to this invention said ACE inhibitor is a compound having the structural formulaEMI3.1 wherein A isEMI3.2 R2 is alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, benzyl, benzylthio, benzyloxy, phenylthio or phenoxy R11 R3, R4, and R6 are the same or different and are hydrogen or alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms R5 is hydrogen, alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or amino alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms p is 0, 1 or 2 q is 0, 1 or 2, provided that the sum of p and q is 1 or 2 and that p is not 0 in formula Z r is 1 or 2 and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Preferably in formula I R1 and or R4 and orR6 is hydrogen and or R2 is benzyl and or R5 is methyl and or p and or q and or r are 1. Preferably A is the group X, Y or Z. Preferablv the compounds are of theS,S,S configuration. Preferred compositions of the invention ccknprise ACE inhibitors having the following structural formulae EMI4.1 EMI5.1 In the above formulae the heavy line P utilized at the chiral centers means that the substituent so bonded is projected above the plane of the paper. The configuration at these chiral centers is denoted as S . The substituent R3 may be hydrogen or alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. h is preferrably hydrogen or ethyl. The invention sought to be patented in its pharmaceutical method aspect is a method for reducing and controlling the elevated intraocular pressure associatd with glaucoma in a human which method comprises administering to said human an effective amount of the above defined pharmaceutical composition. The compounds utilized in the topical ophthalmologically acceptable pharmaceutical compositions and methods of the invention are known in the art as angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitors.Angiotensin II, a pressor substance, is produced in vivo by the action of angiotensin converting enzyme ACE on angiotensin I. Compounds capable of inhibiting the action of ACE are clinically useful for controlling the blood pressure of humans suffering from hypertension.For example, captopril, Compound II is currently in clinical use for this purpose. Other ACE inhibitors are known in the art, and may have a variety of structures.See, for example, An. Rev. Biochem., 51, 283 1982 and references cited therein. It can be concluded fran test results that any ACE h2ffibitor will possess the novel utility described herein however, for purposes of the present invention the preferred ACE inhibitors are compounds which are capable of inhibiting the action of ACE by at least 50 at a concentration of 1 yM or less when tested by the following standard method ACE activity is determined by spectrophotometric assay of the product of the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate, hippuryl histidyl leucine HHL , as described by Cushman and Cheung, Biochem. Pharmacol., 20, 1637 1971 . The ACE used is prepared in a manner similar to that of Cheung and Cushman, Biochem. Biophys. Acta., 293, 451 1973 . Incubation for ACE assays is carried out at 37 C. Each 0.25 ml assay mixture contains the following components 100 mM of potassium phosphate buffer containing 300 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM HHL and 1.87 mU enzyme at pH 8.3 and various concentrations of inhibitors. The enzyme reaction is terminated after 60 minutes by the addition of 0.25 ml of 1N HCl. Inhibitors are dissolved in appropriate solvents. Hippuric acid solution for a standard curve is prepared in a similar manner. Each experiment involves replicate incubations for each condition to be studied. IC50 values the concentration required for the 50 inhibition of ACE activity are derived from calculated regression lines.Each experiment utilizes multiple concentrations of inhibitor. Many ACE inhibitors are known in the art and may be prepared by known methods or by variations thereof.For example, the compound having structural formula fl may be prepared as described in United States Patent 4,046,889 the compounds having structural formulae III and IV may be prepared as described in European PatentApplication 81108348.4, publication number 50,800. The compositions of this invention are considered to be no more toxic than compositions containing the ACE inhibitors for controlling hypertension. When topically administered to the eye, the compounds of the invention reduce intraocular pressure lOP . For example, compound II caused falls in IOP of a magnitude similar to those produced by the antiglaucoma agent timolol when each were administered at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 w v and tested by the following procedure Male New Zealand white rabbits having a normal IOP are conditioned to the laboratory setting for at least one 4 hr period before being used to study drug effects. A Makay Marg applanation tonometer is used to measure IOP. Readings, in mm Hg, are taken in triplicate and the average is recorded. Rabbits are restrained in a cloth sack 2 min.prior to IOP determination. The left lower eyelid is retracted to form a pouch and 1 drop of a local anesthetic is irrigated over the cornea. The lower eyelid is then held closed over the eye for about 1 min Corneal anesthesia is repeated before each set of IOP determinations. Readings are taken just before dosing with drug 0 time and at hourly intervals thereafter.Drugs are administered in a 50 ul volume in the same manner as the anesthetic.
