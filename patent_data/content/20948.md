# CASK FOR RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL, METHOD OF MANUFACTURING SUCH A CASK, MODULE USED THEREBY AND METHOD OF SHIELDING NEUTRONS

## Abstract
A cask 21 for radioactive material, such as nuclear reactor fuel or spent nuclear reactor fuel, includes a plurality of associated walled internal compartments 31, 33, 35 for containing such radioactive material, with neutron absorbing material 51, 53, 54 present to absorb neutrons emitted by the radioactive material, and a plurality of thermally conductive members, 37, 39, 41, 43 such as longitudinal copper or aluminum castings, about the compartment and in thermal contact with the compartment walls 55, 57 and with other such thermally conductive members and having thermal contact surfaces between such members extending, preferably radially, from the compartment walls to external surfaces of the thermally conductive members, which surfaces are preferably in the form of a cylinder. The ends of the shipping cask also preferably include a neutron absorber and a conductive metal covering to dissipate heat released by decay of the radioactive material. A preferred neutron absorber utilized is boron carbide, preferably as plasma sprayed with metal powder or as particles in a matrix of phenolic polymer, and the compartment walls are preferably of stainless steel, copper or other corrosion resistant and heat conductive metal or alloy. The invention also relates to shipping casks, storage casks and other containers for radioactive materials in which a plurality of internal compartments for such material, e.g., nuclear reactor fuel rods, are joined together, preferably in modular construction with surrounding heat conductive metal members, and the modules are joined together to form a major part of a finished shipping cask, which is preferably of cylindrical shape. Also within the invention are methods of safely storing radioactive materials which emit neutrons, while dissipating the heat thereof, and of manufacturing the present shipping casks.
