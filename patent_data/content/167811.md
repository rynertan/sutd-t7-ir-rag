# Split row power JFET.

## Abstract
A power JFET 2 has a common drift region 4 between split first and second longitudinally separated sets of rows 6, 8 of alternating conductivity type layers 10 20 and 21 31 forming a plurality of channels 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 28 and 30 . The JFET has an ON state conducting bidirection al current horizontally longitudinally through the common drift region and the channels. The JFET has an OFF state blocking current flow through the channels due to horizontal ly lateral depletion pinch off. The layers of the rows extend vertically and horizontally longitudinally such that the direc tion of layering extends horizontally laterally. Particular gate structure is disclosed.
