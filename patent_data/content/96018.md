# Hemmer.

## Abstract
A hemmer intended for making double folded hems by that a fabric edge is fed through the device. The porpose of the present invention is to provide a hemmer which in a simple way may be changed in such a way that hems of different widths can be sewed. A further purpose is to provide a simple and relatively cheap device which is characterized by reliance in operation and which is lenient to the fabric. A third purpose is to make it possible to sew fabrics which already are provided with transversal hems. These objects have been achieved by that the device 10 includes at least two folding bars 11, 12 , a main bar 11 and a folding rule 12 arranged at some dis tance above these, that the main bar 11 in its front end is bevelled and designed to fold the fabric edge 41 around the folding rule 12 with the hem edge located between the folding bars 11, 12 , that the second, rear part 19 of the main bar 11 is designed with an upfolded, longitudinal edge section 20 which partly is arranged to extend along and over the rear longitudinal edge of the folding bar 11 and partly is bevelled 21 at its front section.
