# THERMOELECTRIC ALLOY COMPOSITION

## Abstract
A thermoelectric alloy composition is described compris ing from 5 to 95 silicon, from 95 to 5 Germanium, from 0.01 to 0.2 lead and from 0 to 0.2 tin, all percentages being atomic percentages. In a preferred com position at least 50 silicon and 50 Germanium is present with 0.03 to 0.1 lead and from 0 to 0.05 tin. Tin and lead in combination provide lower thermal conductivity and a greater figure of merit than with lead or tin alone. Other preferred compositions are provided and a thermoelectric material and a p n coupling thermoelectric generator 10 incorporating the alloy is disclosed. The alloy composition provides high efficiency of power to heat loss and minimises running costs.
