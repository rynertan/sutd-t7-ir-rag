# Pretreatment for electroplating mineral filled nylon.

## Abstract
A method of preparing the surface of moulded mineral filled nylon to receive an adherent electrodeposited metal coating comprising the steps of exposing the surface to a plasma glow discharge vacuum depositing a film of chromium or titanium on to the plasma treated surface vacuum depositing a nickel film on to the chromium or titanium film to prevent oxidation thereof and then vacuum depositing a copper film on to the nickel film. The plasma gas is preferably inert e.g., argon, helium, etc. and metal deposition is effected so as to avoid oxidation of the chromium titanium and nickel films during processing.
