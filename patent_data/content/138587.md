# Flexible basecoat clearcoat coating compositions.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to flexible basecoat clearcoat coating systems which have excellent adherence to metal and plastic substrates and possess superior weathering properties. The clearcoat composition comprises hydroxy containing urethane modified polyester, made by reacting a urethane modified diol with polyol and diacid component, crosslinkable with amine aldehydes. The basecoat composition comprises hydroxy containing urethane modified polyesters, made by reacting hydroxy functional polyester with diisocyanate, crosslinkable with amine aldehyde and pigment. Optionally, either or both compositions may comprise a high molecular weight linear polyurethane.
