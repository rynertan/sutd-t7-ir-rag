# Copolyetherester compositions stabilized against oxidative degradation and process for their manufacture.

## Abstract
Thermoplastic copolyetherester elastomers are stabilized against heat and light aging by incorporating into the copolyetherester effective concentrations of a phenolic antioxidant and a hindered amine photostabilizer of the formula
