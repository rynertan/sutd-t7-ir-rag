# Monomeric composition of a diol bis allyl carbonate , a dispersed polymer, and a multifunctional acrylate monomer, and polymers prepared therefrom.

## Abstract
Discloses a monomeric composition and the polymeric product thereof. The composition contains a major portion of diol bis allyl carbonate monomer, and effective amounts of a multifunctional acrylate monomer, and a viscosity increasing polymer. Also disclosed is a method of reducing the haze in polymeric compositions of a a diol bis allyl carbonate and b a viscosity increasing polymer, by the addition of a multi functional acrylate monomer to the monomeric composition prior to the polymerization thereof.
