The word processing system is provided with an interactive display for displaying by character generation a data stream representative of alphanumeric characters to be printed together with means for printing the characters on a docu ment on a character by character basis. Operator interac tive apparatus is provided whereby the operator can form a graphics data stream which is displayable on said display by character generation. This graphics data stream may then be integrated into the existing alphanumeric data stream, and the data in this integrated data stream may then be applied to the printing means whereby the alphanumeric characters and the graphic characters represented by this data stream are printed character by character to provide a document having the integrated alphanumeric and graph ic information.
