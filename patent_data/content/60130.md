## Description
A DEVICE FOR SUSPENDING A GLASS THIS INVENTION relates to a device adapted to suspend an item such as a glass or goblet on another item such as a plate or a saucer. At many social functions, such as receptions or buffets, people are expected to hold a plate on which they may place items of foods to be eaten in one hand, and also to hold a glass or goblet to contain drink in the other hand. Whilst, with both hands impeded in this way it is possible to drink readily from the glass or goblet, it is difficult to eat the food. Also, no hand is left free to enable the person to shake hands with anyone that he may meet or be introduced to at the social function in question. If the glass or goblet is merely placed upon the plate the base of the glass or goblet may slide under an item of food present on the plate, and then when the glass or goblet is subsequently raised the item of food may fall from the plate. The present invention seeks to provide a support device which, when utilised, may reduce or obviate the above described problems. According to one aspect of this invention there is provided a device for suspending a stemmed glass, goblet or the like from a plate, saucer or the like, said device comprising means adapted partially to embrace the stem of the glass or goblet and to engage the undersurface of the bowl of the glass or goblet and three adjacent protruding fingers extending from said means, the central finger being adapted to be deflected to engage one surface of the plate, saucer or the like and the two outer fingers being adapted to be deflected to engage the other surface of the plate, saucer or the the like so that said fingers clampingly engage a peripheral portion of the plate, saucer or the like therebetween. Said fingers may be formed integrally with the embracing means, and the embracing means may include a substantially planar portion configured partially to embrace the stem of the glass or goblet, the arrangement being such that when the planar portion is located substantially horizontally the fingers are inclined downwardly to engage an upwardly inclined lip of a horizontal plate, saucer or the like. The suspending means may comprise two arcuate arms defining an open recess or aperture therebetween and a membrane may be provided extending between the parts of the embracing means which actually engage the undersurface of the bowl to engage and retain the stem of the glass, goblet or the like. The membrane may have a slot formed therein to receive the stem of the glass, goblet or the like and the membrane may be of dished configuration. Thus the membrane may grip the stem of the glass, goblet or the like and in one embodiment the membrane is provided with a plurality of slots extending outwardly away from a central aperture formed in the membrane which accommodates the stem of the glass, goblet or the like. According to another aspect of this invention there is provided a device for suspending a stemmed glass, goblet or the like in the substantially upright position from a substantially horizontal plate, saucer or the like, said device including at least two elements adapted clampingly to engage a peripheral portion of the plate, saucer or the like therebetween, and including means adapted partially to embrace the stem of the glass or goblet and to engage the under surface of the bowl of the glass or goblet, said means being formed integrally with at least one of said elements, the embracing means being associated with a membrane which extends between the parts of the embracing means which actually engage the undersurface of said bowl, said membrane being adapted to engage and retain the stem of the glass, goblet or the like. In order that the invention may be more readily understood, and so that further features thereof may be appreciated, the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of one embodiment of a device in accordance with the invention, a plate to which the device is clipped being shown in phantom, and a stemmed glass suspended by the device also being shown in phantom FIGURE 2 is a side elevational view of the device illustrated inFigure 1 and FIGURE 3 is a perspective view of the device illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. Referring to the accompanying drawings Figure 1 illustrates a plate 1 from which a stemmed glass or goblet 2 is suspended by means of a device 30 in accordance with the invention. The device 30 has a portion adapted supportingly to receive a part of the stemmed glass or goblet 2 and is releasably clipped to the edge of the plate or saucer 1. Thus, in use of the device a person may hold a plate in one hand, and may temporarily locate the glass or goblet within the described device, thus leaving the other hand free to pick up an item of food from the plate to enable that item of food to be eaten, or to shake hands with any appropriate person, or to lift the glas or goblet to their lips. The device 30, which is illustrated more clearly in Figures 2 and 3 is integrally moulded of a slightly resilient plastics material and comprises a substantially planar portion 31 which is of substantially C configuration. The portion 31 can be considered to define two arcuate arms 32, 33.Also this planar portion 31 supports a dished web 34 that substantially spans the space defined by the planar portion 31. The dished web defines a central aperture 35 and various radially extending slots 34 which extend outwardly from the aperture 23 and a wider slot 35 of keyhole configuration opening towards the space between the free ends of the two arcuate arms 32, 33.Integrally formed with the planar portion 31 are three fingers 36, 37, 38 whch are adapted to enable the device 30 to be clipped to the edge of a plate, saucer or the like. The central finger 37 inclines downwardly from the said planar portion 31. The two outer fingers 36, 38 however, have initial portions 39, 40 which depend downwardly from the said planar portion 31, and then each have an inclined terminal portion 41, 42 these portions being located underneath the central finger. It will be appreciated that the device 30 can be clipped to the edge of a plate 1 with the central finger 37 located on top of the lip of the plate and the outer fingers 36, 38 located underneath the lip of the plate merely by locating the device appropriately and firmly urging it onto the plate. The configuration of the fingers 36, 37, 38 is such that when the device 30 is clipped to the edge of a plate in this way the fingers 36, 37, 38 are resiliently deformed clampingly to engage a peripheral portion of the plate so that the device is securely mounted in position. When the described embodiment is utilised for example with a stemmed glass 2, the stem of the stemmed glass can be located within the central aperture defined in the web. The arrangement may be such that as the stemmed glass is suspended from the device the web will be resiliently deformed, thus gripping the stem of the stemmed glass to minimise any risk that the stemmed glass may be inadvertently knocked from the device 30.The stemmed glass is thus firmly retained in an upright position when the plate is horizontal. Whilst one embodiment has been described, many modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. In particular, various parts of the described embodiment can be reinforced with appropriate stiffening ribs or flanges.
