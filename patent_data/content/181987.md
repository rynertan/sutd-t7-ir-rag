# Machine for stacking bundles of signatures and like products.

## Abstract
A machine for stacking bundles of signatures and like products comprises a support frame 2 on which is support ed a substantially horizontal endless conveyor 7 having an input end 5 for supplying the products to be stacked and an output end 6 for unloading the stacked products. Rotat ably mounted about a vertical axis 25 adjacent the input end 5 of the conveyor 7 , to which the products to be stacked are supplied with their backs facing in the same direction, is a platform 29 which is movable along the axis 25 which between a lowered position of substantial align ment with the plane of the conveyor 7 , and a raised posi tion in which the products on the conveyor 7 can pass below the platform 29 . The platform 29 is intended to allow the rotation of one of the products of each pair sup plied to the conveyor so that the back of this product faces in a direction diametrally opposite that in which it was supplied to the conveyor. A stacking cage formed by plural ity of vertical guides 34, 35 has, at its lower end, a supply opening above the output end of the conveyor. With the stacking cage 34, 35 is associated a support member 41, 42 movable horizontally between an advanced position in which the support member extends through the supply opening of the stacking cage 34, 35 so as to support the products collected therein, and a withdrawn position in which it is clear of this opening. A loading member 44, 45 is movable vertically between the plane of the conveyor 7 and the opening of the stacking cage. The movement of the laoding member 44, 45 is coordinated with the movement of the support member 41, 42 so as to effect cyclically the supply of the products transferred by the conveyor to the stacking cage 34, 35 while the support member is returned to its withdrawn position for subsequent return to its ad vanced position to support the stack of products formed in the cage 34, 35 .
