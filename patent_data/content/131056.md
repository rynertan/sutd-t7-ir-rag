# METHOD OF CONTROLLING PROFILING.

## Abstract
In this method of controlling profiling, a profiling inhibited region TMI is set and the profiling inhibited region is skipped during profiling. The method comprises the steps of setting a profiling inhibited region TMI and a safety level ZLs in consideration of the configuration of a model MDL moving a tracer head along the surface of the model to effect profiling within a region TM inhibiting the profiling when the tracer head reaches the profiling inhibited region TMI lifting the tracer head to the safety level ZLs moving the tracer head, after it has reached the safety level, at the safety level to the other boundary of the profiling inhibited region approaching the head to the workpiece and resuming the profiling in a region TM upon completion of the approach.
