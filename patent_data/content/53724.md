# Improvement in a disc brake.

## Abstract
In the sliding part of a disc brake a protective member 10 is provided between the bush 3 and the inner wall of the guide hole 2 to prevent the bush from being twisted. The frictional resistance between the guide hole and the protective member is adapted to be smaller than that between the protective member and the bush.

## Description
The present invention relates to a disc br ke of a pin sliding type and particularly to the improvement in the sliding part thereof. With a disc brake of this type having a caliper, a fixed member, a pair of brake pads, and guide pins slidably fitting in guide holes formed in the caliper to support the caliper, it is customary to cover each guide pin with a rubber bush to keep dust off a sliding part around the guide pin. There are two types of bushes one is adapted to cover the guide pin entirely and the other to cover only the exposed portion of the guide pin. The present invention is applicable to disc brakes using bushes of the former type. The bnsh adapted to cover the entire guide pin is apt to fatigue particularly at its middle portion sandwitched between the inner wall of the guide hole and the guide pin because the portion is always under the weigh of the caliper of the brake and its inner surface serves as a sliding surface for the guide pin. The conventional solution to this problem was to givz the bush a larger diameter than that of the guide hole and squeeze or tuck the bush into the guide hole, thereby increasing the strength of the portion and mini mizing its fatigue. This also increases the frictional resistance between th bush and the inner wall of the uide hole, thus preventing the bush from turning, twisting and getting damged, However, this solution was not sufficient in the urability of the bush. An object of the present invention is to provide a disc brake having sliding ports including a bush which has an increased durability. In accordance with the present invention, a tubular protective member having a greasy outer surface is placed between the bush and the inner wall of the guide hole to decrease the frictional resistance between the bush and the inner wall of the guide hole so that the bush will easily turn when subjected to vibration, unlike the bush in the conventional disc brake. This reduces the possibility of the bush being twisted and getting damaged. Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description taken with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a plan view of a disc brake having the sliding parts in accordance with the present invention Fig. 2 is an enlarged sectional view of a portion of the disc brake Fig. 3 is a perspective view of an embodiment of a protective member and Fig. 4 is an end view of another embodiment thereof. Referring to Fig. 1 showing a disc brake to which the present invention is applied, a caliper 1 is provided with a plurality of guide holes 2 in each of which a bush 3 made of rubber is mounted. Into each of the bushes, a guide pin 4 for supporting the caliper is slidably inserted. One end of the guide pin is screwed into a fixed member 5. The brake shown here uses four guide pins. The numeral 6 designates a brake pad. The bush 3 is closed at its outer end but is provided with a small air vent 7 there Fig. 2 . The bush has an expandable bellows portion 8 at its inner edd. ,, lh end 9 of the bush is held on a projection or in an annular groove formed in the guide pin 4. A tubular protective member 10 for protecting the bush is interposed between the inner wall of the guide hole 2 and the bush 3. The protective member should have a greasy or slippery outer surface. The protective member 10 and the bush 3 can be mounted either by squeezing the upper half of the bush in the protective member and mounting the bush together with the protective member in the guide hole or by firstly mounting the protective member in the guide hole and then squeezing the bush into the protective member. Because of the provision of the protective member 10 having a greasy outer surface, the bush 3 is liable to turn when subjected to vibration. This is reverse to the case in the conventional disc brake of this type in which the bush was designed so as not to easily turn.Because of the elasticity of the rubber bush forced into the protective memberf the frictional resistance between the outer surface of the bush and the inner surface of the protective member is larger than that between the outer surface of the protective member and the inner wall of the guide hole. Therefore, if the bush 3 turns, the protective member, too, will turn together with the bush. In this condition, the entire bush turns in a uniform direction and at a uniform speed.This assures that it can be prevented from being distorted or twisted. The protective member 10 comprises a sleeve of a metal or a hard or semi hard synthetic resin Fig. 3 or a tube of a similar material formed from pl e ,, . Fig.4 . Also, it may comprise a seal of Teflon Trademark tightly wound around the bush 3 6E synthetic resin ifi used as the material for the bush, it should preferably have a good heat resistance0 The protective member 10 may have a plurality of oil grooves 11 in its outer periphery to keep its outer surface greasy, as shown in Fig. 3 by dotted line,In addition to the oil grooves, it may have a rugged surface on its inner surface to increase the frictional resistance with the outer surface of the bush. The structure of the sliding part in accordance with the present invention can be applied to other type of disc brakes in which guide pins are fixed to the caliper, not to the fixed member, and guide holes are formed in the fixed member, not in the caliper. It will be understood from the foregoing that with the protective member adapted to turn together with the bush, the bush can be prevented from being distorted when subjected to a turning force. Therefore, even if the bush is subjected to violent vibration, the possibility of the bush being broken is much less. In other words, this structure helps to increase the working life of the bush and the sliding portion of the brake.
