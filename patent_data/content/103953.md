# Separatory module comprising hollow fibre membranes.

## Abstract
A hollow fibre separatory module comprises six sepa rate hollow fibre bundles, four of which 12, 14, 18, 19 are shown, in a single pressure shell 10, 11 . There are two fluid feeds 32, 86 , two concentrate outlets 34, 88 and six separate permeate outlets, four of which 36, 40, 90,92 are shown. For reasons governed mainly by the lengths of the inidividual fibres in the bundles, the overall size of the individual bundles is limited. In the past separatory modules have consisted of a single bundle of fibres in its own individual pressure shell. Such modules have such a small output that they are largely only useful for experimental work. The multi bundle module in accordance with the invention has much greater commercial usefulness.

## Description
Separatory Module comprising Hollow Fibre Membranes The use of membranes to effect separation of gas gas, liquid liquid, and liquid solid mixtures and solutions has achieved general industrial applicability for various purposes, among which are ultrafiltration, hyperfiltration, reverse osmosis and dialysis. In general, membrane elements used inthese separatory techniques are contained in vessels, comprising a container having various inlet and outlet ports. An assembly of membranes is provided within the container and the entire assembly is usually referred to as a separatory module.The internal arrangements of the module are such as to permit the introduction of a feed stream with or without pressure on the upstream faces of the membranes and include means for collecting permeate which passes through the membranes and emerges on their downstream faces, and means for keeping the feed and the permeate from commingling. Membranes have been fabricated in various shapes, such as 1 flat sheets which may typically be supported in a plate and frame structure similar to a filter press 2 flat sheets rolled into spirals with spacing materials interleaved with the membrane and the assembly being sealed to provide spiroidal channels permitting the passage of a feed on one side of the coiled membrane through the membrane to the opposite side of the membrane 3 tubes lining the inner surface of a reinforced braid, the braid itself at times being a component in a larger tube and 4 open ended hollow fibres so arranged and sealed into header plates as to provide a separation of the flow over the external surfaces of the hollow fibres from flows within the bores of the hollow fibres resulting from the passage of permeate through the walls of the hollow fibres, which form the membranes. The present invention is specifically concerned with separatory modules comprising hollow fibres assembled in the form of bundles to provide the desired separation. In EP A 0 009 374, various techniques for the selection of the length of and winding of hollow fibres and the fabrication and assembly of such fibres into separatory modules are described.It is noted however that for the practical usage of such modules in commercial application, small bundles in single bundle housings are too small.On the other hand as taught in the above noted specification other limitations exist which rd ict the size of individual bundles. The object of the present invention is to provide a separatory module comprising a plurality of bundles of hollow fibres, the module being useful in commercial applications. According to this invention, a separatory module which includes a bundle of hollow fibre membranes potted at one end and enclosed in a cylindrical impervious pressure shell is characterised in that there are a plurality of bundles in the shell, a cluster of the bundles within the shell having their axes parallel to but displaced from the shell axis, a base member provided with openings receiving the potted ends of said bundles, a back up disc which, in operation, withstands internal hydraulic thrust on the potted ends of the bundles, fluid feed means for admission of pressurized feed, means for distributing feed fluid uniformly to said bundles, means for collecting and removing permeate passing through said fibre membranes, and means for collecting and removing concentrated non permeated feed fluid. In one example, there are six bundles in a single housing however the invention is not limited to this number and the module can be adapted to accommodate varying numbers of bundles.The module is constructed to have feed material flowing into the shell over the six bundles and the feed can be from a single end or from both ends of the cylindrical shell. The permeates and concentrates may be collected from each bundle separately or from any group of bundles and from either end of the shell. Provision can be made for feeding the feed material radially inwards toward the centre of each bundle or radially outwards from the centre towards the perimeter of each bundle, or parallel to the longitudinal axis of each bundle. A further and significant advantage of the present invention is that it allows for more of the bundles or fibres to be easily replaced on a selective basis. Some examples of separatory modules in accordance with the invention are illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which Figure Ais a perspective view of a first example as seen from the front Figure 1B is a perspective view of the first example but as seen from the rear Figure 2 is a longitudinal sectional view of the first example along the line 2 2 in Figure lA Figure 3 is a front view of the first example as seen in the direction of the arrows on the line 3 3 in Figure 2 Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of the first example as seen in the direction of the arrows on the line 4 4 in Figure 2 Figure 5A is an exploded perspective view of part of the first example illustrating the manner of assembly Figure 5B is a sectional view on a plane indicated by the arrows on the line 5B 5B inFigure 5A Figures 6 and 7 are partial longitudinal sectional views of second and third examples and Figures 8 and 9 show details of the internal construction of one example, Figure 9 being a section on the line 9 9 in Figure 8. As seen in Figures 1 5B, the first example includes an outer cylindrical pressure shell 10, which may be of mild steel or of filament wound plastics material, with an inert impervious inner liner 11 which may be for example of PVC, PTFE or polysulphone, and six hollow fibre bundles which may be fabricated as described in the teachings of the European Patent Application referred to above. In Figure 2 only four bundles 12, 14, 18, and 19 are visible. In the views shown in Figures 3 and 4, three bundles are indicated on each end. The six bundles are arranged in two clusters each containing three bundles and with one cluster at each end of the shell 10. As seen in Figure 2 and in the exploded perspective view of Figure 5A the front cluster in addition to the bundles 12,14 and 16 includes a monolithic inert base 20, typically of vinyl polymer, having three cylindrical openings 42, 44 and 46 in which respective bundles 12, 14 and 16 with respective potted ends 22, 24, and 26 are inserted, backed by a reinforcing back up disc 28, which may be of stainless steel or fibrereinforced plastics material, bolted thereto and a segmented retainer 30. A single feed tube 32 is provided for each cluster as is a single concentrate outlet tube 34. There are three tubes 36, 38 and 40, one for the removal of permeate from each bundle. In Figure SA the openings for receiving the bundles 12, 14 and 16 are respectively indicated by the numerals 42, 44 and 46. Openings for the passage of the feed tube 32 through the base 20 and the disc 28 are respectively numbered 48 and 50. Openings for passage of the concentrate tube 34 through the base 20 and the disc 28 are respectively numbered 52 and 54. Additionally openings for the passage of the permeate tubes 36, 38 and 40 through the base 20 are labeled 56, 58 and 60 respectively and for passage through the disc 28 are labelled 62, 64 and 66 respectively. The arrangement is such that the feed port at the opening 50 is open to the chamber within which the bundles 12,14 and 16 are disposed so that the feed can flow over the outer surfaces of the fibres in all the bundles. Each of the bundles is provided with a rigid centre tube such as tubes 68, 70 and 72 which are respectively connected to the concentrate tube 34 by flexible tubing 74, 76 and 78. The permeate is received from the bores of the hollow fibres in galleries formed in the potting compound at the end of each bundle in a suitable manner such as that described inEP A 0 009 374. A similar arrangement is provided at the rear end of the shell 10 where there are a base 80, a back up disc 82, a segmented retainer 84, a feed tube 86, a concentrate tube 88, and permeate tubes 90, 92 and 94. The module is assembled by steps which include first assembling the outer shell and liner separately and inserting the individual bundles in the openings of each of the bases. Each base is backed by the back up disc and the two parts are bolted together and the segmented retainer is applied. The two sub assemblies are then assembled in the shell and liner. Variations of flow paths can be accomplished with the module. For example, the feed can be from one end only rather than from both ends by merely plugging the feed tube at one end. The recovery of concentrate can be from one end only rather than both ends as shown in Figure 6 wherein the concentrate tube has been modified as is indicated by the numeral 34a and flexible tubes 96 and 98 are shown connected to rigid tubes 100 and 102 in bundles 18 and 19 and to the tube 34a. Both of the examples described above embody the radially inward flow of feed with centre concentrate extraction, the concentrate tube within each bundle being provided with perforations.This can be reversed so as to have radially outward feed flow. Inside the bundles the tubes have equal pressure on the inside and the outside surfaces and therefore do not require radial strength in the tubing. Additionally, the flow pattern if desired can be parallel to the axis of the bundle if an impervious confining outer sleeve is provided around each bundle and the feed is introduced at the unpotted end of each bundle. Thus there will be longitudinal axial flow over the outer surfaces of the individual fibres of the bundles thereby creating higher velocities over the fibres to minimize concentration polarization effects. An end closure member with ports for introducing the feed in this way into the bundles is shown in Figures 8 and 9. Various materials can be substituted and various components can be modified. For example, the outer shell may be of mild steel, of other metals, or of reinforced plastics material. In some circumstances the inert inner liner may be omitted.Additionally the inside surface of the outer shell when of metal can be epoxy coated and the liner can then be omitted. The support disc 28 may also be of fibre reinforced plastics material for example. In the examples disclosed the permeates are collected near the potted ends of the fibre bundles separately as described in EP A 0 009 374.This can be varied however, for example the openings in the monolithic base 20 can be fitted with O rings held in by retaining rings or in grooves which will provide a collection gallery. Such a construction further lends itself to the provision of a single collection gallery such as a plate of plastics material with a reinforcing backing, to take the end thrust on the bundles, and with all three bundles at one end of the shell connecting therewith. The choices in the potted termination of the bundle collection gallery for permeate are many and may embody alternative cutting geometries, pot configurations and relief of the plastics base member to provide a collection gallery. A further example is shown in Figure 7 where parts similar to those of the previously described example have the identification numerals given previously with primes following. In the embodiment of Figure 7,rather than utilizing retainer members, a pipe 104 is disposed along the longitudinal axis of the shell 10 . The pipe 104 is formed as a structural member and can also be utilized for feed or for the extraction of concentrate. In the example of Figure 7 however, three pipes 106, 108, and 110 are provided within the pipe 104, with a pipe 106 providing the feed and pipes 108 and 110.respectively providing the outlets for permeate and concentrate. With the central load bearing pipe 104 many advantages follow. For example, a glass fibre reinforced plastic casing may be used more readily as there is no need for the casing to support the end plates which take the thrust. The utilization of the central support pipe 104 can allow for a unit in which a single central permeate collection chamber 112 receives permeate from centrally located facing potted zones, four of which are shown and indicated by the numerals 114, 116, 118 and 120.
