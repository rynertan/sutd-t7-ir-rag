# Fluidic level control system.

## Abstract
A liquid level control system for controlling the flow of liquid into a reservoir, storage tank or other container. A nozzle develops a liquid flow steam therethrough, and a valve effectively opens and closes the nozzle. A fluid amplifier is associated with the nozzle and includes a fluid power stream, a signal developing port for receiving a fluid pressure signal from the power stream, and a sensor for diverting the fluid power stream from the signal developing port in response to the static presence of the interface at a predetermined sensing level of liquid in the reservoir. A pressure responsive switch is coupled to the valve and is located below the signal developing port and the pressure responsive switch to create a hydrostatic pressure head above the switch to maintain the switch and, therefore, the valve in a first condition when the fluid power stream delivers a fluid pressure signal to the signal developing port. A second condition is developed when the fluid power stream is diverted from the signal developing port.
