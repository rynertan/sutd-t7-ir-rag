# Auto focus circuit for video camera.

## Abstract
An auto focus circuit for a video camera comprises an A D converting circuit 7 for converting to a digital amount a high frequency component absolute value output of a lumi nance signal in a sampling area for focusing. The A D convert ing circuit 7 is connected so that the high frequency compo nent absolute value output of a luminance signal is directly converted to a digital amount. Then, the signal converted to a digital amount is added in an integrating circuit 12 for each field and the signal amount in one field and the signal amount in the coming one field ahead of it or behind it are compared in a comparing circuit 10 so that the output of comparison serves for control of focusing. Thus, addition processing of the high frequency component of the luminance signal, that is, averag ing processing is performed digitally in the integrating circuit 12 . Accordingly, as compared with the case of analog averag ing processing of a signal, the processing operation is stable and as a result the focusing precision is improved.
