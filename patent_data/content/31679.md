# Vidicon type camera tube.

## Abstract
A vidicon type camera tube comprises a beam current control section 1 including a thermionic cathode 3 , a first grid 4 having an aperture of diameter d₁, a second grid 5 having an aperture of diameter d₂ and a beam disc 6 having a diaphragm of diameter d₃ disposed at a distance l along the tube axis from the second grid. The tube further comprises a main lens section 2 constituted by cylindrical electrodes. The diameters d₁, d₂ and d₃ and the distance l are so determined that the value of d₂ l d₃ d₁² may lie in the range where the difference of the effective ca thode loading is positive. This reduces the loss of resolution arising when the beam current is increased.
