# Isostatic compression technique for powder metallurgy.

## Abstract
Powder metallurgy products of high tensile strength are formed in a pore free state by a novel process which entirely avoids the use of canisters. An open pore specimen is purged with depurative gas, backfilled with a reactive gas and, while still immersed in the reactive gas, compressed isostatically to an extent necessary to close the pores. The specimen may then be compresses to full density without the need for either high vacuum or a depurative or reactive gas atmosphere.
