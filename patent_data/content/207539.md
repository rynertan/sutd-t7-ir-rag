## Description
This invention relates to an improvement in the processes for the preparation of white, high molecular weight, poly tetramethyleneadipamide , nylon 4,6. By the process of this invention, the prepolymerization step is limited under controlled reaction conditions so that a prepolymer is formed with only a very low degree of poly merization, whereby a shorter, commercially viable, after condensation time is achieved to obtain a high molecular weight final polycondensation polymer product in a sub stantially reproducible manner. While the preparation of polyamides has been known for over forty years, such polyamides have generally only been nylon 6,6, nylon 6, and nylon 6,10. In particu lar, nylon 4,6 was not commercially known, and in previous years was only formed as a laboratory material of known discolored characteristics and unsatisfactory polymeriza tion. See Gaymans et al., J. Poly Sci Since the appearance of United States Patents 4,408,036, 4,446,034, and 4,460,762, and certain related other publications, it has now become known that a white high molecular weight poly tetramethyleneadipamide could be prepared through the use of a two stage process. In the first stage, known as the prepolymerization stage, the salt of 1,4 diaminobutane and adipic acid was heated in the presence of an excess of 1,4 diaminobutane over a pe riod of several hours at temperatures ranging from 150 to 310 C. Subsequently, in the second aftercondensing stage, the prepolymer was heated at a temperature of between 225 and 275 C in, for instance, a fluidized bed or a rotating drum for at least about four hours, while in the presence of water vapor and an inert atmosphere, and preferably at nearly atmospheric pressure. The examples of these above mentioned patents indicate that according to the proce dures there used and the temperatures employed, total re action times of about eight hours were required for the combined prepolymerization and aftercondensation stages in order to obtain a satisfactory, useful high molecular weight product. An article in the Journal of Polymer Science While it is generally desirable to execute the combined polycondensation reactions, both the prepolymer ization and the aftercondensation stages, at moderate tem peratures, and at the same time seek a minimization of the total reaction time with avoidance of undesired side reac tions, while also seeking to maximize the production ca pacity of the plant with a high reproducibility of product characteristics resulting from the process, achieving all of those goals simultaneously has proven to be a difficult task. It is the principal object of this invention to provide a reproducible method for the preparation of high molecular weight white poly tetramethyleneadipamide using moderate temperatures and relatively short reaction times. The process according to the present invention now provides for the reproducible production of high mo lecular weight white poly tetramethyleneadipamide con sisting substantially of repeat chain units ofNH CH₂ ₄ NH CO CH₂ ₄ NH whereby the preparation is effected through the heating, in a first prepolycondensation stage of a salt of 1,4 dia minobutane and adipic acid, or the salt thereof, in the presence of a controlled excess of 1,4 diaminobutane, at a temperature which is controlled between 180 and 240 sub sequently, the thus formed prepolymer is aftercondensed in the solid phase at a temperature controlled within the range of 225 to 275 to form a high molecular weight poly amide and wherein, in particular, the number average de gree of polymerization achieved in the first prepolymeri zation stage is maintained at a level between 5.0 and 18, while the reactor contents therein are also maintained in a liquid state through maintaining the presence of a suf ficient quantity of water to achieve that goal, and also with termination of the prepolymerization reaction by the technique of discharging the liquid reaction mass from the reactor under the autogenous pressure developed therein during the prepolymerization reaction. The aftercondensa tion reaction is then conducted in the solid phase at a temperature between 225 and 275 C. in the presence of an inert atmosphere which also contains water vapor, and preferably at about atmospheric pressure, so that there is obtained a high molecular weight poly tetramethyleneadipa mide product having a degree of polymerization such as to exhibit a relative viscosity of at least 2.5 dl g, advan tageously at least 2.8 dl g, as determined in a solution of 1 g of polyamide and 100 ml of 96 weight percent sul furic acid at 25 C. The number average degree of polymerization re ferred to above is defined as the average number of dia minobutane and of adipic acid units per molecule of poly mer. Thus, according to this definition, a molecule which contains x units of the salt of 1,4 diaminobutane and adipic acid in the chain has in fact a number average de gree of polymerization, The end group contents A special characteristic of the process provided by the present invention is that the prepolymerization stage is controlled so as to limit the extent of the poly condensation reaction in such a manner that the prepolymer is obtained having only a relatively low degree of poly merization. Even though a low degree of polymerization is thus effected in this first liquid phase reaction, sur prisingly the resulting prepolymer, when made under the conditions set forth, requires only a considerably shorter time in the solid phase aftercondensation stage than would be required to obtain a substantially identical final high molecular weight product from a prepolymer which itself has already possessed a relatively higher de gree of polycondensation. Thus, unexpectedly, by decreas ing the time for the prepolymerization stage, under the stated reaction conditions, there is also achieved a de crease in the required time for the aftercondensation stage, even though other reaction conditions comparable to known processes are employed, and consequently a signifi cant shortening of the total reaction time. On the other hand, it has also been found in the investigations leading to this invention that if the pre polymerization stage is conducted such that the degree of polymerization achieved therein is limited to too low a degree, the otherwise beneficial effect on the reaction velocity for the aftercondensation state is substantially nullified and at the same time a high possibility of lump formation in the solid phase aftercondensation stage reac tor also exists. Therefore, according to the present invention, the prepolymerization stage must be effected at a tempera ture of between 180 and 240 , advantageously between 190 and 220 C, while observing the other stated additional re action conditions. The reaction will be carried out in a closed reactor under the elevated autogenous pressure which thereby develops. The starting material may be either diaminobu tane and adipic acid added as such, or the combined salt thereof, along with excess diaminobutane. Up to 20 wt. of other polyamide co monomers may also be present such as are known to be useful including aliphatically saturated lactams such as caprolactam, valerolactam, undecalactam and laurolactam, and amino carboxylic acids, and aliphatic and aromatic dicarboxylic acids, such as succinic acid, sebacic acid, isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid, and aliphatically saturated diamines, such as particularly hexamethylene diamine or 1,4 aminomethylcyclohexane. The final product will still contain at least 80 of repeat units derived from 1,4 butane diamine and adipic acid. As used hereinafter, the term nylon 4,6 shall be understood as including such co polymers. It is also advantageous that the prepolymeriza tion stage is conducted in the liquid phase to obtain the additional benefit that a substantially homogeneous heat transfer into the reaction mass is facilitated which per mits a more rapid heating up of the reactor contents and apparently a more uniform product. In view of the rela tively short reaction times desired in the practice of this invention, this feature also leads to a more repro ducible result. For this purpose, it is desired to have present at the start of the prepolymerization stage an amount of water of from 0.1 wt. up to as much as 50 weight percent, with respect to the combined weight quan tity of the adipic acid and the aminobutane or the salt thereof which is employed in the reaction. Advantageous ly, the amount of added water is limited to 20 wt. , al though in any event the amount of water is at least suffi cient to maintain the reactor contents in the liquid phase during the entire duration of the prepolymerization reac tion. The prepolymerization reaction is thus continued until the number average degree of polymerization, At the end of the prepolymerization reaction, instead of cooling the reactor and obtaining the product from the prepolymerization stage in solid form in the re actor, according to the present invention the reaction is terminated by discharging the reaction mass from the reac tor in the liquid form under the autogenous pressure developed in the reactor. The water content therein is thus evapo rated or flashed off through the expansion to atmospheric pressure. If necessary, there may be a subsequent drying step before the prepolymer is charged to the afterconden sation stage reactor. Conveniently, this discharge of the prepolymer from the reactor and expansion thereof to at mospheric pressure may be effected by spray drying tech niques or the equivalent thereof. This has the signifi cant advantage that the prepolymer can be readily obtained in powder form. The aftercondensation reaction is thereafter effected with the prepolymer in the solid phase but e.g. in the form of a fluidized bed at a temperature main tained between 225 and 275 C until a polyamide is obtained having a high degree of polymerization indicated by a rel ative viscosity of at least 2.5 dl g, advantageously at least 2.8 dl g, as measured in a solution of 1 g in 100 ml 96 weight percent sulfuric acid at 25 C. For these higher degrees of polymerization, the determination of the degree of polymerization based upon end group content is general ly lacking in precision, as the accuracy with which end group contents may be determined diminishes sharply as there is a decreasing number of end groups in a mass of polymer. Therefore, determination of the molecular weight by measurement of the relative viscosity is far more pre cise. It has been determined that for a relative viscos ity of 2.5 dl g, the number average degree of polymerisation The aftercondensation stage is carried out in an inert atmosphere at a pressure of from 0.001 to 10 bar de sirably in the presence of a small amount of added water vapor. The water content of the inert gas atmosphere may be from 5 to 100 volume percent, preferably from 20 to 50 vol. . In the prepolymerization reaction, the excess of diaminobutane pressent can amount to up to 6 weight percent with respect to the total stoichiometric amount of di aminobutane and adipic acid. It is desirable that the di aminobutane excess be such that the prepolymer obtained from this first stage reaction contains an excess of from 0.02 to 0.70 millequivalents of amino end groups The invention may now be illustrated by the fol lowing examples and comparative examples, without however being restricted to the specific embodiment therein. In the following examples, the prepolymerization step was effected in each instance by heating 3800 grams of the salt of 1,4 diaminobutane and adipic acid in a 10 liter autoclave to a temperature of between 190 and 210 C, in the further presence of an excess of 1.0 to 1.2 weight percent of diaminobutane. Water was also present in an amount between 5 and 10 weight percent of the reactor con tents and so that the reactor contents remained in the liquid phase during the complete polymerization reaction. The prepolymerization reaction was then stopped by dis charging the reaction mass from the reactor in liquid form under autogenous pressure, generally between 8 and 15 bar, at the reaction temperature and while maintaining a nitro gen atmosphere at ambient atmospheric pressure over the discharged material. This operation is conducted by use of spray drying techniques, or the equivalent thereof to obtain a powdered prepolymer. Thereafter, in each in stance, 30 grams of the prepolymer was aftercondensed at a temperature of 260 as measured in the powder in a ro tating reactor maintained at atmospheric pressure using a gas stream deliverying a flow of 24 normal liters of ni trogen and 3 grams of water vapor per hour. In each of the following Examples I III and in each of the Comparative Examples A C, the excess of amino acid end groups in the prepolymer over carboxylic acid end groups was maintained between 0.15 and 0.36 meq g. The prepolymerization step was conducted at 190 195 C under an autogenous pressure of 8.7 bar for one hour after which the reaction was stopped as described above. A prepolymer having a degree of polymerization This Comparative Example was carried out under the same conditions as Example I except that autogenous pressure was 7.9 bar and the prepolymerization stage was stopped after 0.25 hours, at which point the degree of polymerization in the prepolymer In this instance, two prepolymers were prepared by reaction as described above at a temperature of 210 C and for a prepolymerization reaction time of 0.5 hours. The amount of excess diaminobutane employed was from 1.1 to 1.2 and the prepolymerization was effected in the presence of 8.5 and 5.4 weight percent of water and with an autogenous pressure of 12.9 and 11.7 bar, respectively. The aftercondensation reaction was then carried out on these prepolymer products having respective degrees of polymerization, In this Comparative Example, the same reaction conditions as in Example II were employed with an autogen ous pressure of 13.2 bar but the prepolymerization reac tion was continued for four hours in the presence of 1.1 1.2 weight percent of the excess diaminobutane and 6.7 weight percent of water. The aftercondensation reaction was con ducted in the same manner, with similar sampling, and the results are illustrated on Figure 1 in the curve numbered 3. From these experiments, it is immediately appar ent that the practice according to the present invention permits a substantial saving in total reaction time. It will also be noted that even though the degree of polymer ization, In these examples, the conditions described above were again employed for a number of prepolymers hav ing different degrees of polymerization, A series of prepolymers were prepared at a pre polymerization reaction temperature of 210 C in the pres ence of 7.5 weight percent of water. The degree of poly merization of each of these prepolymers was of the same order of magnitude however, the amount of excess diamino butane was modified in order to produce a difference be tween the relative content of amino and of carboxylic acid end groups. These various prepolymers were then subjected to the aftercondensation reaction, and the progress of the aftercondensation stage was followed by taking samples at various times and plotting the measured resulting relative viscosity against the time of the aftercondensation reac tion itself. The characteristics of the respective pre polymers are shown in Table 1 below. The aftercondensa tion product characteristics are illustrated in Figure 3. As these data indicate, in order to obtain an aftercondensation polymer having a relative viscosity of 3.0, more than 4 hours of aftercondensation reaction time is required if prepolymer 2 is employed having a rela tively large excess of amino groups with respect to car boxylic acid groups . On the other hand with prepolymer 1 having a nearly identical This Example illustrates that the adverse effect of too high a degree of polymerization in the prepolymer on the time required for the aftercondensation reaction is intensified by the effect of an amino end group excess over carboxylic acid end group which is too high. That is, a prepolymer was prepared as described above at a re action temperature of 210 C and with a degree of polymeri zation, This invention thus provides a method for repro ducibly achieving high molecular weight, white nylon 4,6 products in much shorter total reaction times than have been hitherto realized. The unpredictability of the results of the pres ent invention, as against prior state of the art, may be illustrated by a review of the scattered results obtained in prior studies. For instance, in U.S. patent 4,460,762, the results of Table 1 thereof may be presented as follows relative to the data described above in regard to the present invention Further, from U.S. patent 4,408,036, the reported data from the examples thereof may be summarized as follows Reviewing the above data will indicate that there has been little consistency and little reproducibility in prior reactions, and certainly no realization of the im portance of the combination of reaction condition param eters, for both stages, which has been discovered in this invention. It will also be appreciated from the foregoing data that the present invention has a substantial advan tage in that the combined reaction time for both the pre polycondensation and aftercondensation stages is now con fined to a period of requiring only up to about 5 hours in order to achieve the final polycondensation product. As shown in the above examples of the invention, the two re action stages can even be completed in a combined time of less than about four hours.
