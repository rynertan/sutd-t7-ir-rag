# Production of short metal fibers.

## Abstract
Short metal fibers 5 are directly produced from a work metal block 1 . The product fibers 5 are very thin and short, e.g., 200 Âµm in diameter and 20 mm in length to the max imum. A bar like or pillar like work metal block 1 is rotated, to which an elastic cutting tool 2,3 is contacted, and entering of cutting edge 3 corresponds to length of fiber 5 to be obtained. The tool 2,3 is effected with fine feed 15 and at the same time positively generated with self excited vibrations. The self excited vibration forcibly separates in division thin layer accumulating et the cutting edge 3 of the tool 2,3 one by one without having connections in length of the fibers 5 each other. The process produces needle like fibers 5 of microscopic cross sectional area. the thin and short metal fibers 5 are produced in the same number as number of the self excited vibrations, and the fiber 5 is right angled in axis with the cutting direction.
