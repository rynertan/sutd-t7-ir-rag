# Crank angle detecting device for an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A device for determining a crank shaft angular position performs operation for determining the crank shaft angular position at an occurrence of timing control in an internal combustion engine control, such as fuel injection timing control, spark ignition timing control and so forth. In determination of the crank shaft angular position, an angular acceleration is firstly calculated with respect to respective intervals of crank reference angle signals. In calculation, the determined angular acceleration is regarded as constant instead of an angular velocity. At the same time, time intervals between respectively adjacent crank reference signals and between one of crank reference signal and a timing control signal immediately following to the one of crank reference angle signal are measured. Based on the determined angular acceleration and the time interval be tween the one of crank reference angle signal and the timing control signal, the crank shaft angular position at the occurrence of the timing control signal is determined. This may provides determination of the crank shaft angular position precisely following to the actual crank shaft angular position even when the engine revolutional fluctuation is significant.
