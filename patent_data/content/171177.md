# ADDRESSING SMECTIC DISPLAYS

## Abstract
In operating a display device incorporating a matrix ad dressed smectic cell, a strobing pulse is applied to each row electrode in turn while data pulses are applied in parallel to the column electrodes. The data pulse voltage excursion is less than the minimum voltage V
