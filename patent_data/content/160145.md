# ALKYLATION OF AROMATIC MOLECULES USING WIDE PORE, AMORPHOUS SILICA ALUMINA CATALYST

## Abstract
Aromatic molecules such as benzene, toluene, ethylben zene, naphthalene, tetralin etc. are selectively monoalkylated using heterogeneous wide pore, amorphous silica alumina catalyst. High activity is maintained while achieving upwards of 89 monoalkylation of the aromatic starting material. The process has the advantage of not employing Friedel Craft catalysts, such as HF of A1C1â‚ƒ which are difficult to remove from the alkylated product stream and the presence of which could be detrimental to oil stability.
