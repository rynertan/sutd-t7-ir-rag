## Description
THIENOPYRIMIDINE DERIVATIVES, THEIR PREPARATION AND THEIRMEDICAL USE The present invention relates to a series of new thienopyrimidine derivatives having valuable therapeutic activity, to processes for preparing these derivatives and to their medical use for therapy or prophylaxis. The thienopyrimidine derivatives to which the present invention relates have been found to have various classes of therapeutic activity, including hypoglycaemic activity the ability to inhibit platelet aggregation diuretic activity and hypotensive activity. Certain of the compounds of the invention exhibit two or more of these classes of activity. Various thienopyrimidine derivatives are known and certain of these are known to have the ability to inhibit platelet aggregation. Thus, German OffenlegungsschriftNo. 2,200,764 Karl Thomae GmbH discloses a series of thienopyrimidine derivatives having an amino group at the 2 position and a cyclic amino group, such as a morpholino group, at the 4 position. The compounds disclosed in this specification are said to have the ability to inhibit the aggregation and adhesion of blood platelets. A related series of thienopyrimidines is disclosed in U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,146,716 assigned toImperial Chemical Industries Limited and in United KingdomPatent Specification No. 1,570,494 Imperial ChemicalIndustries Limited . These compounds have a variety of substituents at the 2 and 4 positions and are said to have anti fungal, anti viral, anti bacterial and insecticidal activities and are proposed for the treatment of fungal, viral and bacterial infections of plants and for the eradication of insect pests. There is no suggestion that these prior compounds can be used for the treatment of humans or other animals or have any ability to inhibit the aggregation of blood platelets, or have hypoglycaemic, hypotensive or diuretic properties. We have now discovered a series of new thienopyrimidine derivatives, various of which have hypoglycaemic activity and can be used to treat hyperglycaemia, some of which have the ability to inhibit the aggregation of blood platelets and can thus be used for the therapy or prophylaxis of thrombosis, and some of which have been found to have hypotensive activity and or diuretic activity and can be used to treat hypertension and oedema.

The compounds of the invention may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula II EMI37.1 in which R3 and R4 are as defined above and X represents a halogen atom, a lower alkylsulphinyl group, an arylsulphinyl group, a lower alkylsulphonyl group or an arylsulphonyl group with a compound of formula RêH in which Rê is as defined above , to give a compound of formula III EMI37.2 in which R2, R3, R4 and X are as defined above , reacting said compound of formula III with a compound of formulaR7H in which R7 represents any one of the groups defined for R1, in which any free amino group is optionally protected , to give a compound of formula IV EMI38.1 in which R2, R3, R4 and R7 are as defined above , if necessary, removing any amino protecting groups and optionally acylating a compound in which R6 represents a hydrogen atom to give said compound of formula I and, if necessary, salifying said compound. Where X in the compound of formula II employed as the starting material in the preparative process of the invention represents a halogen atom, it is preferably a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom. Compounds of this type can be prepared by the methods disclosed in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 24, 376 1981 or German Offenlegungsschrift No. 2,200,764. When X in the compound of formula II represents a lower alkylsulphinyl group, this is preferably a methylsulphinyl, ethylsulphinyl, propylsulphinyl, butylsulphinyl or isobutylsulphinyl group. When X represents an arylsulphinyl group, this is preferably a benzenesulphinyl, p toluenesulphinyl or naphthylsulphinyl group. When X represents a lower alkylsulphonyl group, this is preferably a methylsulphonyl, ethylsulphonyl, propylsulphonyl, butylsulphonyl or isobutylsulphonyl group.When X represents an arylsulphonyl group, this is preferably a benzenesulphonyl, toluenesulphonyl or naphthylsulphonyl group. Compounds of this type can be prepared by alkylating or arylating in a conventional manner a compound of formula v EMI39.1 in which R3 and R4 are as defined above , which can be prepared by a known method Synthesis 1972 , 268 and then oxidising the resulting compound by conventional means. Although the groups or atoms represented by the two symbols X in the compound of formula II may be the same or different, those compounds in which the two groups or atoms represented by X are identical are more easily obtainable and are therefore preferred. The first step in the preparative process of the present invention, that is to say the preparation of a compound of formula III by reacting a compound of formula II with an amine of formula R2H in whichR2 is as defined above , is preferably effected in the presence of a base and in an inert solvent. The nature of the base employed in this reaction is not critical and a wide range of organic bases, such as triethylamine, N methylmorpholine, pyridine, 4 N,N dimethylamino pyridine, N,N dimethylaniline or 1,8 diazabicyclo 5.4.0 undecene 7 DBU , or inorganic bases, such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate or potassium hydrogen carbonate, may be employed. It is also possible to use an excess of the amine compound of formula R2H as the base. Of these, we particularly prefer to use an organic base, such as triethylamine,N methylmorpholine, pyridine, N,N dimethylaniline or DBU, or an excess of the amine compound of formula R2H. The nature of the solvent employed for this reaction is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction.Suitable solvents include aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or xylene halogenated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride or chloroform esters, such as ethyl acetate or propyl acetate ethers, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol or isoamyl alcohol amides, such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide or hexamethylphosphoric triamide or dimethyl sulphoxide. We particularly prefer to use halogenated hydrocarbons especially methylene chloride or chloroform , ethers especially diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran or alcohols especially methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol or isoamyl alcohol . The reaction temperature may vary over a wide range but is preferably from 10 C to 40 C, more preferably from 0 C to ambient temperature. The time required for the reaction will vary, depending mainly upon the reaction temperature and the nature of thestarting materials and base, but it is usually within the range from 1 hour to 30 hours where R3 and R4 represent hydrogen atoms or alkyl groups or from 1 hour to 5 days where R3 and R4 together represent a polymethylene group. After completion of the reaction, the desired compound of formula III can be recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional means. For example, one suitable recovery sequence comprises adding a water imiscible organic solvent to the reaction mixture washing the mixture with water and, if necessary, drying it and then distilling off the solvent to give the desired compound which can, if necessary, be further purified by conventional means, for example recrystallisation, reprecipitation or chromatography. The second step in the preparation of the compounds of the invention comprises reacting the compound of formula III with a compound of formula R7H in which R7 is as defined above to give a compound of formula IV . This reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a base and preferably in an inert solvent. Suitable bases and solvents include those illustrated for use in the first step, that is the preparation of the compound of formula III from the compound of formula II . The temperature employed in this reaction may vary over a wide range, for example from 0 C to 300 C, preferably from 50 C to 200 C. The time required for the reaction will vary, depending mainly upon the reaction temperature and on the nature of the starting material and base employed, but a period of from 1 to 10 hours will normally suffice. Compounds of formula IV in which R2 and R represent the same amino groups can, if desired, be prepared directly by reacting the compound of formula II with more than 2 equivalents per equivalent of said compound of formula II of the amine compound of formula R2H under the same reaction conditions as are employed for the second reaction step described above. After completion of the reaction, either the second step alone or the combined first and second steps, the desired compound of formula IV can be recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional means. For example, one suitable recovery sequence comprises adding a water imiscible organic solvent to the reaction mixture washing the mixture with water and, if necessary, drying it and then distilling off the solvent to give the desired compound which may, if necessary, be further purified by conventional means, for example recrystallisation, reprecipitation or chromatography. The third step in the above reaction sequence is the optional step of de protecting any protected amino groups also as part of this. step, where a compound has been prepared in which R1 represents the aforementioned heterocyclic amino group and in which R6 represents a hydrogen atom, this may, if desired, be converted to a compound in which R6 represents a formyl group or a C2 C4 alkanoyl group by an acylation reaction. Removal of protecting groups is a reaction well known in the art and the nature of the reaction employed will depend on the nature of the protecting group, as is well known. A wide variety of protecting groups may be employed and their nature is not of importance to the present invention.Generally, the protecting group chosen will be an acyl group selected for its ability to be removed easily by contacting the compound of formula IV with an acid e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, trichloroacetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid or p toluenesulphonic acid or an alkali e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide in an inert solvent for example water, an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol or propanol or an aqueous alcohol .The reaction temperature may vary over a wide range, e.g. from ambient temperature to 200 C, preferably from 50 C to 1500C. The time required for the reaction will vary, depending mainly upon the reaction temperature, the nature of the starting material and the nature of the acid employed, but generally a period of from 10 minutes to 10 hours will suffice. Conversion of the compound in which R6 represents a hydrogen atom to a compound in which R6 represents a formyl or C2 C4 alkanoyl group can be effected by contacting the compound of formula I in which R6 represents a hydrogen atom with a reactive derivative of the carboxylic acid corresponding to the formyl or C2 C4 alkanoyl group, in an inert solvent. Examples of such reactive derivatives include acid halides, such as acetyl chloride, acetyl bromide, propionyl chloride, propionyl bromide and butyryl chloride mixed acid anhydrides of monoalkyl carbonates, such as methyl carbonate or ethyl carbonate, or of monoaryl carbonates, such as phenyl carbonate or naphthyl carbonate, with a carboxylic acid, such as acetic acid or propionic acid and acid anhydrides, such as acetic anhydride or propionic anhydride. We prefer to use acid chlorides or mixed acid anhydrides of monoalkyl carbonates with a carboxylic acid. The nature of the solvent employed in this reaction is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction. Examples of suitable solvents include aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene or xylene aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as hexane or heptane ethers, such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran halogenated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, chloroform or carbon tetrachloride ketones, such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone and esters, such as ethyl acetate or propyl acetate. Of these, we prefer aromatic hydrocarbons or halogenated hydrocarbons. The reaction temperature is preferably from 0 C to ambient temperature and the time allowed for the reaction is usually from 1 to 20 hours. Where the reactive derivative of the carboxylic acid employed is an acid chloride or acid anhydride, the reaction is preferably effected in the presence of an acid binding agent, which may be an organic base, such as triethylamine, N methylmorpholine, pyridine or 1,8diazobicyclo 5.4.0 undecene 7 DBU , or an inorganic base, such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate or potassium hydrogen carbonate. Preferred acid binding agents are such organic bases as triethylamine,N methylmorpholine, pyridine or DBU. After completion of either or both of the above reactions, the desired compound may be recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional means. For example, one suitable recovery sequence comprises adding a waterimmiscible organic solvent to the reaction mixture washing the mixture with water and, if necessary, drying it and then distilling off the solvent to give the desired compound which may, if necessary, be further purified by conventional means, for example recrystallisation, reprecipitation or chromatography. An alternative method by which the compounds of the invention may be prepared would start with a compound analogous to the compound of formula II but in which the group or atom represented by X at the 2 position is replaced by a group R7 as hereinbefore defined and the group or atom represented by X at the 4 position is replaced by a group of formula YH in which Y represents an oxygen or sulphur atom or a group NH these starting materials may be prepared as described in Libigs Ann. Chem. 699 1980 .These starting materials may be treated in one of the following ways a The starting material is reacted with a halogenating agent, such as phosphorus oxychloride or phosphorus pentachloride, to give the corresponding 4 halo compound, which is then reacted with a compound of formulaR2H in which R2 is as defined above , in the presence of a base, after which, if necessary, the resulting compound is deprotected to give the desired compound of formula I . Each of the reactions mentioned above, that is to say the reaction with the halogenating agent and the reaction with the compound of formula R2H, is preferably effected at a temperature of from ambient temperature to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. b the starting material is alkylated with an alkylating agent such as a dialkyl sulphate or alkyl halide, e.g. methyl iodide . Where Y represents an oxygen atom or a group NH , the resulting compound is reacted with a compound of formula R2H and then, if necessary, deprotected to give a compound of formula I . Alternatively, if Y represents a sulphur atom, the product of the alkylation is oxidised, e.g. by m chloroperbenzoic acid, to give the corresponding 4 alkylsulphinyl or 4 alkylsulphonyl compound, which is reacted with a compound of formulaR2H, optionally in the presence of a base, and then, if necessary, the resulting product is deprotected to give the desired compound of formula I . The resulting compound may then be separated from the reaction mixture and, if necessary, further purified by conventional means. The compounds of the invention are useful for the treatment of a variety of disorders. Specifically, many of the compounds of the invention have the ability to inhibit the aggregation of blood platelets and are thus useful for the prophylaxis and therapy of thrombosis.Compounds of the invention in which R2 represents an amino group or a monoalkylamino group and one or both of R3 and R4 represents a hydrogen atom additionally possess hypoglycaemic activity and can be used for the treatment of various hypoglycaemic conditions, such as diabetes mellitus. Compounds in which R1 represents a 1 piperazinyl group also have strong hypoglycaemic activity. Compounds in which R1 represents a tetrahydro 1,4 thiazin 4 yl or thiomorpholino group additionally possess remarkable hypotensive activity and can be used for the treatment of hypertension. Certain specific compounds of the invention have also been found to exhibit remarkable diuretic activity and can be used for the treatment of oedema and of hypertension. The compounds of the invention may be administered orally for example in the form of tablets, capsules, granules, powders or syrups or parenterally in the form of injectable solutions or they may be administered as suppositories. The dose will vary, depending upon the age and condition of the patient, as well as the disorder which is to be treated and the route of administration, but the adult daily dose is usually from 1 to 1,000 mg, more preferably from 2 to 500 mg, which may be administered as a single dose or in divided doses. The various activities of certain of the compounds of the invention are demonstrated by the following experiments.In these, the compounds of the invention are identified by the numbers assigned to them in the foregoing list.Hypoglycaemic activity In this experiment, the hypoglycaemic activity of various of the compounds of the invention was measured in mice after loading a large quantity of glucose. The test animals were male mice of the ddY strain having a body weight of from 25 to 27 g. Each experiment was carried out on a group of 6 mice. Each test compound was administered orally in an amount of 10 mg kg to the mouse followed, 10 minutes later, by the oral administration of 1.2 g kg of D glucose.30 minutes after administration of the D glucose, blood was collected from each mouse and the blood sugar concentration was measured using a commercially available kit NewBlood Sugar Test , a product of Boehringer Mannheim YamanouchiPharmaceutical Co. Ltd, . The inhibitory rate, R, was calculated from the following formula R 1 B x 100 A in which A represents the blood sugar concentration of a positive control group and B represents the blood sugar concentration of the group to which the test compound was administered. The results are shown in Table 1. As a control, the experiment was also carried out with the known hypoglycaemic agent, tolbutamide 2 2 aminoethylamino 4 morpholinothieno 2,3 d pyrimidine named VK 744 , a compound disclosed in German Offenlegungsschrift No.2,200,764 and 4 isopropylamino 2 piperidinothieno 2,3 d pyrimidine hereinafter referred to as ICI 154 , a compound disclosed in U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,146,716.The results are shown in Table 1.

To the mixture was then added a collagen solution to a final concentration of 5 ug ml, to induce aggregation.The aggregation was measured using an aggregometer produced by Rikadenki Co. Ltd. The inhibitory rate R was calculated from the following formula R 1 B x 100 A in which A represents the maximum aggregation rate when only a solvent was added and B represents the maximum aggregation rate when the test compound was added.

The mice were employed in groups of five for each test. Each test compound was suspended in a 0.3 carboxymethylcellulose saline solution and administered orally in the dose shown in Table 3 to the mouse. For the period of 2 hours after administration, the urine was collected and the urine volume and concentration of sodium ions were measured. These results were compared with results obtained from a control group, to which the carboxymethylcellulose saline solution alone was administered,and the results are reported in Table 3 as the percentage increase in urine volume and sodium ion concentration over that of the control group. The compounds tested were CompoundNo. 3 of the present invention and hydrochlorothiazide abbreviated as HCT .

Each animal was treated as follows. The animal was anaesthetized by the intraperitoneal administration of 50 mg kg of sodium pentobarbital. A polyethylene cannula was then inserted into the abdominal aorta by the method of Weeks and Jones J.R. Weeks and J.A. Jones, Proc. Soc.Experimental Biol. Med., 104, 646 648 1960 . The.other end of the cannula, leading out of the body, was fixed to the neck. One week after the operation, when the animal had recovered from post operative invasion, this end of the cannula was connected to a system for measuring blood pressure, in order to measure the blood pressure and heart beat directly without the need for any further anaesthesia or restraint. The system for measuring blood pressure employed was an improved version of that originated byLaffan et al. P.J. Laffan, A. Peterson, S.W. Hitch andC. Jeunelot, Cardiovascular Res., 6, 319 324 1972 . The compound under test was suspended at the desired concentration in a 0.3 w v aqueous solution of carboxymethylcellulose and administered orally in total dose of test compound of 100 mg kg. The blood pressure and heart beat of each animal were observed for 1 hour before administration to give control values and then the animal was given the sample when these values were stable. After administration of the sample, the blood pressure and heart beat of each animal were measured for 24 hours at 15 minute intervals. The results are shown in the following Table 4, in which the abbreviations used are as follows max maximum change in blood pressure mmHg after administration of the compound under test Tmax time in hours after administration of the test compound required for the blood pressure to attain its maximum change T0.Smax time in hours after administration of the compound under test for the blood pressure to return to one half of its maximum value.
