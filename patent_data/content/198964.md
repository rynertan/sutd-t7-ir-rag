# An arrangement for fire control.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a tracking radar 17 rigidly connected to the fire tube 11 of a gun and influencing the set motors 14 of the gun in order to, after locking onto a target, bring the radar axis and thereby the axis of the fire tube 11 to follow the target. According to the invention the tracking radar 17 is accommodated in a protection en velope 20 which is fixedly mounted on the elevation system 12 of the gun and which at the front end in the fire direction is closed by a radome 21 . The protection envelope 20 and radome 21 are dimensioned so as to withstand the forces arising at fire, in particular toprevent the compression waves arising at fire to deform the antenna means of the radar 17 , so that the radar will be effective with substantially main tained accuracy also during the fire.
