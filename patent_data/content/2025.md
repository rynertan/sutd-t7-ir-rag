# Hydrokinetic torque converter with lock up clutch and internal vibration damping.

## Abstract
A hydrokinetic unit 10 for use with an automatic power transmission mechanism in an automotive vehicle driveline comprising a lock up clutch 88, 90, 92 for connecting directly the turbine 30 and the impeller 12 of the hydrokinetic unit to effect a fully mechanical, direct drive therethrough, the lock up clutch being situated internally of the hydrokinetic unit and including a vibration cushion and damper 106 that cushions clutch engagement and eliminates or reduces undesirable torque variations or pulses in the driveline when the clutch is engaged and during clutch engagement thereby improving the driveability of the vehicle.
