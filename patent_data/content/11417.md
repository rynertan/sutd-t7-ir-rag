# Optically active or racemic aminal derivatives, process for preparing same and for converting same to alpha hydroxyaldehydes.

## Abstract
An optically active or racemic Î± hydroxyaldehyde of formula The compound of formula 1 above can for example be prepared by reaction of an arylglyoxal with an optically active or racemic 2 N substituted aminomethyl pyrrolidine or by reacting a Grignard reagent with an optically active or racemic diazabicyclooctane derivative which itself can be prepared from a glyoxylate ester or glyoxylate ester hemiacetal and a 2 N substituted aminomethyl pyrrolidine.
