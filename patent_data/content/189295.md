# A SIGNAL MODULATION MODE FOR A SEMICONDUCTOR LASER

## Abstract
A signal modulation mode for a semiconductor laser wherein a high frequency signal current 6 which is amplitude modulated by signals 2 to be transmitted is applied to the semiconductor laser with a bias current 4 set at around the threshold current level 3 , resulting in a modulated output power light 5 .
