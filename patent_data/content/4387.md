# Electrodes for electrolytic processes.

## Abstract
Electrodes for electrolytic processes comprise an electrically conductive and corrosion resistant substrate, having a coating thereon which contains a solid solution of tin dioxide and bismuth trioxide, preferably in a ratio of 9 1 to 4 1 by weight of the respective metals. This solid solution may form the active coating or an intermediate layer covered with other electrocatalytic materials or may be included in a multi component coating having selective properties for halogen evolution and oxygen inhibition.
