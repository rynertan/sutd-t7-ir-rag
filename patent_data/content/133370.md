# Slack limiter for a magnetic tape cassette.

## Abstract
A cassette 2 includes a slack limiter 24 which engages tape 14 extending from reels 10, 12 within the cassette 2 and prevents the tape 14 from unwinding from the reels 10, 12 and developing slack or looseness. In one embodiment, the slack limiter 24 is formed from a thin, flexible, resilient strip of material which includes a mounting portion 34 formed by folding the strip to produce a compression member 36 ex tending at an acute angle to the slack limiter 24 . In a second embodiment, the slack limiter 88 includes two oppositely ex tending strips and a mounting portion 98 formed by two folds 100, 102 and an interconnecting compression member 104 . In either embodiment, the mounting portion 34, 98 of the slack limiter 24, 88 is retained in the housing 43, 52 by a receptacle 26, 78 which compressively engages and bows the compression member 36, 104 .
