## Description
5R, SR Penem Compounds, Their Prodhçtion and Use This invention relates to novel 6R substituted 5R penem 3 carboxylic acid derivatives of the formula EMI1.1 wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different and each is a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon group, or RÚ and Rê taken together represent an alkylene group R is a hydrogen atom or an acyl group R4 is a hydrogen atom, R5 is an alkyl, alkylthio, heterocycle thio, alkoxy or heterocycle oxy group which may optionally be substituted, or R4 and R5 taken together represent a lower alkylene group which may optionally be substitued and R6 is a hydrogen atom or an ester residue, or pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof, and a method of producing said derivatives and salts. While penicillins and cephalosporins still remain to be important antibiotics, the so called carbapenem compounds such as thienamycin, epithienamycin A to D, MM 13902, MM17880, MM 4550, C 19393 H2, C 19393S2, etc. have recently been isolated from the natural kingdom and reported to have strong antibacterial and 8 lactamase inhibiting activities.These compounds have a 5R carbapenem ring as the common nucleus and a substituted hydroxyalkyl group at 6 position in the S orientation trans to 5R 1 or in theR orientation acids to 5R . On the other hand, attempts have been made to synthesize non natural ss lactam compounds and Woodwards et al synthesized for the first time a penem compound having an acylamino group in 6R cis position and reported that the compound has antibacterial activity.Since then, a structural similarity of carbapenem compounds to penem compounds has attracted attention and several 6 substituted hydroxyalkylpenem compounds have been synthesized. However, because of the difficulties in the synthetic procedures, majority of the 6 substituted hydroxyalkylpenem compounds actually synthesized so far are 6 5 trans compounds and the 6 5 cis compounds synthesized are limited to 6R hydroxymethyl 2 2 amino ethylthio 5R penem 3 carboxylic acid British Patent No. 2,048,261 and 6 1 hydroxy l ethyl 2 methylpenem 3 carboxylic acid British Patent No. 2,042,515 .Moreover, the compound disclosed inBritish Patent No. 2,048,261 can be produced only with a low efficiency and, hence, in a poor yield becuase the antibacterially active, B lactamase inhibiting 5R compound is obtained after isomerization of the 5position near by the end of the synthetic process with a large proportion of the product being the inactive 5S compound . The two kinds of compounds disclosed inBritish Patent No. 2,042,515 are racemic compounds, one of which is a mixture of 1 R, 5R, 6R compound and llS, 5S, 6S compound which is neither antibacterially active nor ss lactamase inhibiting, with the other being a mixture of 1 S, 5R, 6R compound and 1 R, 5S, 6S compound which is also inactive.Moreover, the production process is complicated and time consuming because the trans compound which is produced as a main product in an early stage of the process must be separated from the contemplated cis compound. After an intensive research the present inventors found that the optically active 6R SR cis compound I can be produced with a high efficiency by cyclizing a compound having the formula EMI3.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 have the meanings defined hereinbefore, R is an ester residue, and Z is a phosphonio or phosphono group and that this particular compound I has strong antibacterial and 6 lactamase inhibiting activities.

The group Z of the starting compound II is one of the phosphonio or phosphono groups which are well known in connection with the Wittig condensation reaction and particularly is a triaryl e.g. triphenyl or tri lower alkyl e.g. tributyl phosphonio group or a phosphono group diesterified by lower alkyl e.g. ethyl . WhenZ is such a phosphono group, it may contain a still more strongly basic cation, especially a suitable metal ion e.g. lithium, sodium or potassium ion . Referring, further, to the group Z, triphenylphosphonio is preferable in some cases and a diethylphosphono group accompanying an alkali metal ion e.g. sodium ion is preferred in other cases. The cyclization may be effected spontaneously, that is to say during the production of the starting material compound. Or, it may be effected by heating the compound at a temperature of about 30 to 2000C, preferably about 50 to 1500C. The reaction is preferably conducted in the presence of an inert solvent such as aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. hexane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene or mesitylene, halogenated hydrocarbons e.g. methylene chloride, etc., ethers such as diethyl ether, lower alkylene glycol di lower alkyl ethers, etc. e.g.dimethoxyethane, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, etc.cyclic ethers,e.g. dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, etc., carboxylic acid amides, e.g. dimethylformamide, etc. dilower alkyl sulfoxides,e.g.dimethyl sulfoxide, or lower alkanols,e.g. methanol, ethanol, t butanol, etc., or mixtures thereof, and if necessary in an inert gaseous atmosphere e.g. argon, nitrogen gas, etc. . More satisfactory results are often obtained when the reaction is conducted in the presence of a reducing agent such as hydroquinone. When the amino, hydroxyl or and carboxy groups of the resulting compound have been protected, these groups are removed if necessary. Amino protecting groups can be eliminated as follows t Butoxycarbonyl, for instance, can be removed with an acid ss,ss,ss trichloroethoxyzarbonyl with zinc and an acid monochloroacetyl with thiourea, an Nsubstituted dithiocarbamic acid or the like and p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl by catalytic reduction. Elimination of hydroxy protecting groups can be effected as follows. For example, formyl and trifluoroacetyl can be removed with potassium hydrogen carbonate in aqueous methaol tetrahydropyranyl with dilute hydrochloric acid, and B,B,B trichloro ethoxycarbonyl with zinc and an acid.Removal of carboxyprotecting groups can be performed in the same manner as that described hereinafter in respect of removal of the protective group R of the carboxyl group at 3 position, and this can be performed simultaneously. The resulting compound III can be separated and purified by conventional procedures such as concentration, pH change, redistribution, solvent extraction, crystallization, recrystallization, chromatography, etc. The resulting compound III can be converted to a carboxylic acid compound by removing the carboxy protecting group in the conventional manner. While the method of removing the protective group varies with the type of protective group, the group can be eliminated by a procedure generally known in the art. Preferably, the compound III in which the substituent group R is a reductively removable protective group such as haloalkyl, aralkyl, benzhydryl or the like is contacted with a reducing agent. The reducing agent used in this reaction is as follows. For example, when the carboxy protecting group is a haloalkyl group such as 2,2 dibromoethyl or 2,2,2 trichloroethyl, zinc and acetic acid can be suitably employed.When the protective group is an aralkyl group such as benzyl, p nitrobenzyl or the like or benzhydryl, hydrogen and a catalytic reduction catalyst such as palladium on carbon or an alkali metal sulfide such as sodium sulfide or potassium sulfide are suitably employed. o Nitrobenzyl can be eliminated by irradiation. The reaction is conducted in the presence of a solvent. The solvent may be any appropriate solvent if it will not interfere with the reaction. Preferred are alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, etc., ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, etc., fatty acids such as acetic acid, etc., and mixtures of such organic solvents with water.The reaction temperature is generally OOC to near room temperature and the reaction generally goes to completion in 5 minutes to 12 hours, the time required varying with different starting compounds and reducing agents. After completion of the reaction, the carboxydeprotected compound can be isolated from the reaction mixture by conventional procedures such as those mentioned hereinbefore. For example, the insolubles are filtered off from the reaction mixture, the organic solvent layer is washed with water, and after drying, the solvent is distilled off. When RÚ and Rê in the product 6R substituted 5R penem 3 carboxylic acid derivative I are different, there exists an isomerism diastereomers due to the asymmetric carbon atom C11, and while these isomers are shown by the single formula, all of them fall within the scope of this invention. When the substituent groups RÚ andRê are different from each other and R is a hydrogen atom for example, 6 l hydroxy l ethyl , the configuration of the hydroxyl group may be changed as desired. Thus, as the compound having a l S hydroxyethyl group as a 6substituent group, for instance, is treated with an organic acid in the presence of a phosphine derivative such as triphenylphosphine and an azodicarboxylic acid diester such as azodicarboxylic acid diethyl ester, there is obtained the corresponding l acyloxyethyl derivative having the Rconfiguration at position l of the 6 side chain. Preferred species of said organic acid are lower fatty acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, etc., and aromatic carboxylic acids and arylalkanoic acids such as benzoic acid, phenylacetic acid, etc. The solvent is preferably a halogenated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride, chloroform, etc. and ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, etc.The reaction temperature preferably ranges from 0 C to 50 C and the reaction time preferably from 10 minutes to 2 hours.This l inversion reaction can be performed even before elimination of the carboxy protecting group of III . The product compound I may be usedinthe free form or may be used in the form of a pharmacologically acceptable salt as prepared inthe per se known manner. For example,there may be employed such salts as the salts of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, etc., and the ammonium salts such as those of ammonium, dicyclohexylammonium, diisopropylammonium, triethylammonium, etc., although the sodium salt and potassium salt are especially desirable. When R5 contains a basic group such as amino, dimethylamino, formimidoyl or the like, the compound I may be converted to and used as the salt of an acid. Examples of such salt include the salts of such mineral acids as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, etc., or such organic acids as formic acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, etc., although the hydrochloride is a preferred salt. The compound I or salt thereof, which is produced in the above manner, is a valuable antibiotic which is active against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gramnegative bacteria and is used as a pharmaceutical agent for man and domestic animals. Especially it can be safely used as an antibacterial agent for the treatment of infections caused by gram positive or gram negative bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Krebsiella pneumoniae, etc.Moreover, the antibacterial agent is also incorporated in animal diets as preservatives for preventing putrefaction of feedstuffs. The compound or salt can also be used for dscouragng or arresting growth of harmful bacteria on medical or dental equipment and instruments or for inhibiting growth of undesirable bacteria in industrial especially, water based paints and paper mill white waters. For such and other purposes, the compound or salt can be used in aqueous compositions in the concentration of 0.1 to 100 parts per million of each solution. In various pharmaceutical preparations, the product compound I or a salt or ester thereof can be used either singly or in combination with other active components.The dosage forms that can be used include capsules, tablets, powders, solutions, suspensions, elixers, etc. and these preparations can be administered orally, intravenously or intramuscularly.

Liquid preparations for oral administration can be made available in such forms as aqueous or oil suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, elixers, etc. or may be dry or lyophilized preparations for extemporaneous dissolution in suitable solvents.Such liquid preparations may contain suspending media such as sorbitol syrup, methylcellulose, glucose sugar syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, aluminum stearate gel, etc., hydrogenated edible oils such as almond oil, coconut oil fractions, oily esters, etc., propylene glycol, ethyl alcohol, preservatives such as methyl or propyl p hydroxybenzoate, etc. or sorbic acid. Suppositories may contain ordinary suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides. Injectable compositions may be provided in ampoules or other unit dosage forms containing preservatives.Such compositions may be oil or aqueous suspensions, solutions or emulsions, and may contain such auxiliary agents as suspending agents, stabilizers and or dispersing agents. Moreover, the active component may be made available in the formof a powder which can be reconstituted with a suitable solvent such as sterile pyrogen free water before use. The pharmaceutical preparations according to this invention further include such other suitable forms which permit absorption of the active component from the mucous membranes of the nose and throat or the bronchial tissues, such as powders, liquid spray mists, or inhalants, lozenge, throat paints, etc. For application to the eye or the ear, the drug can be usedinthe form of a liquid or a semi solid capsule or a drop. Moreover, the drug according to this invention can be formulated with hydrophobic or hydrophilic bases to provide external preparations such as ointments, creams, lotions, paints, powders. etc. Aside from or in addition to carriers and vehicles, there may be incorporated stabilizers, binders, antioxidants, preservatives, lubricants, suspending agents, thickeners, flavorants, etc. Moreover, it is possible to incorporate other active components in compositions to provide a broader antibacterial spectrum. For domestic animals, the drug according to this invention can be formulated as intramammary preparations using slow release or quick release media. The dosage depends on the condition of the patient to be treated or the body weight of the host animal, the method and frequency of administration, and the route of administration, e.g. parenteral and other routes preferred for general infections and the oral route for alimentary tract infections.

A preferred daily dose for an adult man is about 80 to 120 mg as active component per kg body weight. The compositions of this invention can be administered in various unit dosage forms such as solid or liquid forms which can be orally taken. The composition of such a solid or liquid unit dosage form may include 0.5 to 99 , preferably about 10 60 of the active component. The composition generally contains about 15 to 1500 mg of the active component. However, the preferred amount is about 250 to 1000 mg. Since the compound, salt or ester according to this invention has ss lactamase inhibiting activity, it can be used in combination with ss lactam antibiotics.

Such a solvent is preferably one that will dissolve both compounds IV and XIV .Examples of the solvent include alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n propanol, etc., dialkyl alkanoic acid amides such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, etc., cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, etc., ethers such as ethyl ether, diglyme, dimethoxyethane, etc., polar aprotic solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide, hexamethylphosphoric acid triamide, etc. and mixtures of water with such organic solvents The base mentioned above may be a virtually optional type only if it is capable of even a temporal release of an anion at 6 position of compound IV . However, it is important to select a suitable combination thereof with the solvent. When a protic solvent is employed, there is employed an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, etc.When an aprotic solvent is employed, there may be suitably employed n butyllithium, methyllithium, diethyl sodium amide, diisopropyl sodium amide, isopropylcyclohexyl sodium amide, ditrimethylsilyl sodium amide, etc. Triethylamine, diethylisopropylamine, diethylamine, diisopropylamine, dicyclohexylamine, 1,5 diazabicyclo 4,3,0 non 5 ene, 1,8 diazabicyclo 5,4,0 7 undecene, etc. may suitably be employed in both an aprotic solvent and a protic solvent. While the reaction temperature and time are not especially critical, it depends mainly on the species of starting compounds IV and XIV , solvent and base employed.Generally, the reaction is conducted at 78tC to 50 C for 1 to 14 hours. After completion of the reaction, the product compound V of this reaction is recovered from the reaction mixture in the conventional manner. Por example,a water immiscible organic solvent such as ethyl acetate and water are added to the reaction mixture, the organic layer is separated then washed with water and dried over a desiccant and the solvent is distilled off to recover the desired compound. The product compound thus produced can be further purified, if necessary, by the conventional procedure such as recrystallization, preparative thin layer chromatography, column chromatography, etc.Second Step In this step, the compound V is subjected to reductive removal of isocyano group to selectively give a cisoriented 6 hydroxyalkySpenicillin derivative VI and, if necessary, the latter derivative is reacted with an acylating agent or a hydroxy protective group forming reagent.The above two reactions may be performed in areverse order.That is to say, the acylation or protection of the hydroxy group may be first performed and the removal of isocyano group then performed to obtain the desired compound VI .This reductive removal of isocyano group is accomplished by contacting the compound V , or the compound V whose hydroxy group has been acylated or protected, with a reducing agent such as tri n butyltin hydride in the presence of a radical reaction initiator such as benzoyl peroxide, azobisisobutyronitrile or the like. Since this is a radical reaction, it is preferably carried out in an oxygen and air free atmosphere, that is to say in a nitrogen or argon gas atmosphere, for instance. The type of solvent used for this reaction is not particularly critical insofar as it does not interefere with the reaction but generally benzene, toluene, xylene, acetone and the like are employed.The reaction temperature is not especially critical, either, but generally ranges from about 400C to about 10000. While the reaction time varies with different species of starting compounds, reaction temperature, species of solvent, etc., it is generally in the range of 2 minutes to 24 hours. After completion of the reaction, the product compound can be isolated from the reaction mixture in the conventional manner. For example, the solvent is first removed from the mixture and if necessary, the excess reagents and side reaction byproducts are removed by recrystallization and column chromatography. The acylation or protection of the hydroxy group can be accomplished by the conventional method used in the field of organic chemistry. Since the acylation reaction results in the introduction of the acyl group as R3 of compound I and, hence, influences the antibacterial and 8 lactamase inhibiting activities of I , care should be exercised in the selection of the type of acyl group. Accordingly, for example, active derivatives of aliphatic carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, n butyric acid, isobutyric acid, etc., arylcarboxylic acids such as benzoic acid, etc., or aralkylcarboxylic acids such as phenylacetic acid, etc. e.g. the corresponding acid halides, acid anhydrides, mixed acid anhydrides, active esters, etc. are employed. The protection reaction of the hydroxyl group is preferably carried out with a reagent that is commonly used in the field of penicillins and cephalosporins, for the deprotection reaction is conducted for the purpose of regenerating the hydroxy group under mild conditions.Examples of such reagents are silylating agents such as tert butyldimethylsilyl chloride, trimethylsilyl chloride, etc., chloroformic acid benzyl esters such as p nitrobenzyl chloroformate, o nitrobenzyl chloroformate, etc., methoxyethyl chloride, tetrahydropyran, etc. The acylation or protection of the hydroxy group with the above mentioned reagents is sometimes accelerated in the presence of a base. The acylation or protection reaction of the hydroxy group may be carried out before or after any optional one of the third to tenth steps which are described hereinafter but since the same principle of the reaction as set forth above is applicable, there will not be reiterated in the following description.Third Step This is a process in which compound VI is oxidized to compound VII . This reaction is accomplished by contacting compound VI with an oxidizing agent in a solvent, The preferred oxidizing agent includes, for exmaple, peracids such as m chloroperbenzoic acid, perbenzoic acid, peracetic acid, etc., hypochlorous acid esters such as t butyl hypochlorite, iamyl hypochlorite, etc., salts of hypochlorous acid such as sodium hypochlorite, potassium hypochlorite, etc., permanganates such as potassium permanganate, sodium permanganate, etc., periodates such as sodium metaperiodate, etc., ozone, and so on. Since the use of a large excess of the oxidizing agent in this reaction may result in the production of the sulfo compound, it is preferable to use an equivalent or a slight excess thereof. The type of solvent is virtually optional only if it will not undergo oxidation.When an organic oxidizing agent is employed, such solvents as chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, etc., are preferred in many cases because they dissolve compound VI and oxidizing agent well. It is also possible to employ water in combination with other solvents. To avoid by production of the sulfo compound, generally the reaction temperature is preferably low. Usually, the reaction is conducted at 200C to 300C. The reaction time depends largely on the species of starting compound, oxidizing agent and solvent employed, the reaction temperature, etc., and generally ranges from about 10 minutes to about 24 hours. After completion of the reaction, the product compound VII of this reaction step is isolated from the reaction mixture in the conventional manner. When, for example, a peracid is used as the oxidizing agent, the reaction mixture is washed with an alkaline aqueous solution to remove the excess reagent and after drying, the solvent is distilled off. The compound VII may exist as isomers with respect to the sulfoxide. Thus, VII exists as a mixture of four isomers when R1 and R2 are different from each other and as a mixture of two isomers when R1 and R2 are identical.If necessary, these isomers can be independently isolated by such procedures as recrystallization, column chromatography.Fourth Step In this step, compound VII is reacted with a thiol compound of the formula R7 SH XV wherein R7 is an alkyl, aryl, aralkyl or heterocyclic group, to give compound VIII . This reaction is generally conducted in a solvent.The solvent includes, among others, benzene, toluene, xylene, tert butanol, isopropyl alcohol, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, dioxane, dimethylformamide, etc., mixtures of such solvents, and other solvents which will not interfere withthereaction. While the reaction temperature is not critical, it is preferably within the range of 50 to 1500C. The reaction is generally carried out inthe neighborhood of the boiling point of the solvent used and goes to completion in 0.5 to 20 hours. After completion of the reaction, the solvent is distilled off and the product compound is isolated generally by silica gel column chromatography. The product compound may be used in the next reaction without prior purification. Examples of R7 in compound XV are as follows. I Alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, etc., 11 unsubstituted or substituted aryl groups such as phenyl, xylyl, tolyl, naphthyl, chiorophenyl, nitrophenyl, bromophenyl, etc., SII unsubstituted or substituted aralkyl groups such as benzyl, phenethyl, phenylpropyl, xylylmethyl, p chlorobenzyl, o nitrobenzyl, p nitrobenzyl, pmethoxybenzyl, 2,4 dimethoxybenzyl, 2 chloro 4 methoxybenzyl, etc, IV aliphatic or aromatic heterocyclic monocyclic groups or heterocyclic polycyclic groups containing one or more same or different hetero atoms, i.e. oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur atoms, such as pyrrolidinyl, piperazinyl, homopiperidinyl, furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, pyridyl, imidazolidinyl, benzothiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, thiazolyl, thiatriazolyl, oxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, oxatriazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, etc., and such heterocyclic groups having one or more same or different substituents such as alkyl groups, e.g. methyl, ethyl, etc., alkoxy groups, e.g.methoxy, ethoxy, etc., halogen atoms, e.g. fluoro, chloro, bromo, etc., nitro, aryl groups, e.g. phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, etc., substituted aryl groups, e.g. chlorophenyl, nitrophenyl, etc., and aralkyl groups, e.g. benzyl, phenethyl, etc.Fifth Step This is a stepinwhich compound VIII is treated with a base to isomerize its double bond and to thereby give compound IX . This reaction is accomplished by contacting compound VIII with a base in the presence of a solvent. The base used for this purpose may be virtually of any type only if it is able to withdraw the a hydrogen from the alkoxycarbonyl group of VIII , although triethylamine is generally employed.There is no particular limitation on the type of solvent only if it does not interfere with the contemplated reaction but, generally, chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, etc. are employed. There are no particular limits to the reaction temperature and the reaction is generally conducted at 0 C to near room temperature. However, to avoid coloration of the reaction mixture, the reaction is preferably conducted in the neighborhood of OOC. Thus, generally, the reaction is conducted in dichloromethane using an equivalent of triethylamine at 0 C for about 1 hour. After completion of the reaction, the triethylamine is not distilled off but neutralized with an acid such as hydrochloric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, etc.This prodedure is preferred because the reaction mixture is protected against coloration. The product compound IX can be further purified, if necessary, by the conventional procedures such as recrystallization, preparative thin layer chromatography, column chromatography, etc.Sixth Step This is a step where compound IX is reacted with an active derivative of a carboxylic acid of the formula EMI30.1 R Wherein R4 and R5 have the meanings defined hereinbefore, in the presence of a trivalent phosphorus compound and water to give compound X . This reaction is accomplished by contacting compound IX with an active derivative of carboxylic acid XVI in the presence of water and a trivalent phosphorus compound.The solvent used for this reaction may be any solvent that is compatible with the water, trivalent phosphorus compound and active derivative of carboxylic acid XVI . Generally, however, chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethyl acetate, benzene, toluene, hexane and other nonpolar aprotic solvents are preferably employed. Preferred examples of said trivalent phosphorus compounds are phosphorous acid esters such as trimethyl phosphite, triethyl phosphite, tripropyl phosphite, triphenyl phosphite, etc., and phosphines such as triphenylphosphine, etc. The active derivative of carboxylic acid XVI may for example be the acid chloride, acid bromide, acid anhydride, mixed acid anhydride, active esters or the like. There are no particular limits to the reaction temperature but the reaction is preferably conducted under cooling or at room temperature. For the purpose of accelerating the reaction as well as when an acid is byproduced depending on individual reactions, a base such as sodium hydrogen carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, pyridine, picoline, collidine, lutidine, aniline, dimethylaniline, diethylaniline, etc. is often allowed to be present in the reaction system so as to neutralize the acid. In view of decomposition with the water present in the system, it is desirable to employ the active carboxylic acid derivative in excess of a molecular equivalent. After completion of the reaction, the product compound X of this reaction step can be separated from the reaction mixture in the conventional manner and, if necessary, further purified by such procedures as recrystallization, preparative thin layer chromatography, column chromatography, etc. There are cases in which compound X can be synthesized from compound VII by a different route of synthesis as shown below by reaction formulas but it must be noted that the compound of formula XVIII is sometimes produced as a dominant reaction product.EMI31.1 Seventh Step In this step, compound X is subjected to ozonolysis and the resulting a keto carboxylic acid derivative is solvolyzed to compound XI . The first reaction of this step is accomplished by contacting compound X with ozone in a solvent. The solvent may be any solvent only if it dissolves X , does not react with ozone and does not solidify at low temperature.Generally, however, methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, chloroform, etc. are suitably employed. The reaction is preferably conducted at a low temperature, i.e. preferably at 780C to 300C. The reaction time depends largely on the species of starting compound and solvent used, the reaction temperature and the capacity of the ozone generator used but the reaction is complete in one minute to one hour under a constant excess supply of ozone. After completion of the reactoin, the product a ketocarboxylic acid derivative of the first phase of this process can be recovered from the reaction mixture in the per se conventional manner. For example, an inert gas such as nitroben, argon gas, etc. is introduced into the reaction mixture to drive out the excess ozone and, then, the mixture is contacted with a sulfide such as dimethyl sulfide, diethyl sulfide, etc. or a reducing agent such as sodium hydrogen sulfite, sodium thiosulfate, etc., followed by the conventional separation and purification procedure to recover the a keto carboxylic acid derivative. Generally, this a keto carboxylic acid derivative is subjected to the second phase of this reaction process without further purification. The reaction in the second phase of this process is accomplished by subjecting the above a keto carboxylic acid derivative to solvolysis. The solvents which are preferably employed for this solvolysis reaction include polar protic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, etc.However, virtually any solvent is sufficient only if it does not interfere with the reaction. The addition of a catalytic amount of such an agent as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, etc. for accelerating the reaction leads to satisfactory results in many instances. Silica gel may also be used for the same purpose. While there are no particular limits to the reaction temperature, the reaction is preferably conducted in the neighborhood of room temperature. The reaction time depends largely on the species of starting compound and solvent, the presence, amount and type of catalyst, and the reaction temperature, the reaction generally goes to completion in one to 24 hours provided that methanol is used as the solvent, sodium methoxide present and the reaction conducted at room temperature. After completion of the reaction,the product compound XI of this reaction step is separated from the reaction mixture in the per se conventional manner. For example, the solvent is distilled off from the reaction mixture and the residue redissolved in a water immiscible solvent, followed by aqueous washing, drying and distillation for removal of the solvent. The product compound thus obtained contains the byproduct oxalic acid ester and, if necessary, can be further purified by the per se conventional procedure such as recrystallization, preparative thin layer chromatography, column chromatography, etc.Eighth Step In this step, a compound of the general formula XII is produced. Here, the compound XI is subjected to addition reaction with a glyoxylic acid ester derivative of the general formula OHC COOR XIX wherein R has the meaning defined hereinbefore. This reaction is accomplished by contacting compound XI with compound XIX in the presence of a solvent. While the solvent may be virtually any solvent only if it does not interfere with the reaction, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, etc., aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, etc., dialkylalkanoic acid amides such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, etc., and mixtures of such organic solvents are preferred. This addition reaction is sometimes accelerated in the presence of a base. Examples of the base used for the purpose include organic bases such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, etc., aluminum sodium silicate molecular sieve, etc.The reaction temperature is not particularly critical and may range from room temperature to about 1200C. Preferably, the reaction is conducted in the neighborhood of room temperature when the base is used, and under heating at a temperature near the reflux point of the solvent when the base is not employed.If necessary, the reaction may be conducted in an inert gas atmosphere such as nitrogen, etc. The reaction time depends largely on the species of starting compounds, the reaction temperature, etc. but generally ranges from about 1 hour to about 96 hours. After completion of the reactoin, the product compound XII of this reaciton step is separated from the reaction mixture in the per se conventional manner. For example, the insolubles are first filtered off if necessary. Then, the residue is washed with water and dried, followed by distillation for removal of the solvent and excess reagents. Where R0 of compound X and R of compound XII represent the same group, XII can be synthesized from X by a different route of synthesis as depicted below.EMI34.1 Ninth Step In this step, compound XII is halogenated to give compound XIII . This reaction is accomplished by contacting compound XII with a halogenating agent in the presence of a solvent.While the type of solvent for this purpose is not particularly critical, thionyl halides such as thionyl chloride, thionyl bromide, etc., phosphorus oxyhalides such as phosphorus oxychloride, etc., phosphorus halides such as phosphorus pentachioride, phosphorus pentabromide, etc., and oxalyl halides such as oxalyl chloride may be employed with advantage. This reaction is preferably conducted in the presence of a base. Preferred species of said base are organic bases such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, lutidine, etc. The type of solvent used for this reaction is not particularly critical but ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, etc. are preferred. The reaction temperature is not very critical, either, but is preferably low so that side reactions will be inhibited.Thus, the reaction is preferably conducted in the range of 400C to room temperature. If necessary, the reaction may be conducted in an inert gas, e.g. N2, atmosphere. The reaction time depends largely on the species of starting compounds, the reaction temperature, etc. and ranges generally from about 10 to 30 minutes. After completion of the reaction, the product compound XIII of this reaction step is separated from the reaction mixture in the per se conventional manner. For example, the solvent and excess reagents are distilled off from the reaction mixture to give XIII . Generally, this compound is usedinthe next reaction without further purification. Referring to this product compound XIII , the halogen atom X can be replaced with a different halogen atom by a conventinoal method. For example, the corresponding chloro compound is treated with an inorganic bromide or iodide salt such as lithium bromide,potassium iodide, etc., in an organic solvent such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide or dimethyl sulfoxide to give the bromo or iodo compound.Tenth Step This is a process for the production of II , wherein compound XIII is converted to a phosphorane compound. This reaction is accomplished by contacting compound XII with a phosphine compound or a phosphorous acid ester compound and a base in a solvent. The phosphine compound may for example a tri lower alkylphosphine such as tri n butylphosphine or a triarylphosphine such as triphenylphosphine. The phosphorous acid ester compound is preferably selected from among tri lower alkyl phosphites such as triethyl phosphite, etc. and di lower alkyl phosphite alkali metal salts such as sodium dimethyl phosphite. The base is preferably an organic base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, 2,6lutidine, etc. when a phosphine compound is employed, and an alkali metal hydride such as a sodiumhydrideor a lower alkyllithium compound such as n butyllithium when a phosphorous acid ester compound is employed.The solvent used for this reaction is virtually of any type only if it will not interfere with the reaction but is preferably selected from among aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, cyclohexane, etc., ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane etc., aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, etc., and dialkylalkanoic acid amides such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, etc. while the reaction temperature is not particularly critical, the reaction is preferably conducted generally in the range of room temperature to 10000. If necessary, this reaction may be conducted in an inert gas atmosphere such as nitrogen, etc. The reaction time depends mainly on the species of starting compounds, the reaction time, etc. but ranges form about 1 to 20 hours. After completion of the reaction, the product compound II of this reaction step is separated from the reaction mixture in the per se conventional manner. For example, water and a water immiscible organic solvent such as ethyl acetate are added to the reaction mixture, the organis layex is separated, washed with water and dried over a desiccant and the solvent is distilled off t9 give Il The product compound it , if necessary, can be purified by the per se conventional procedure such as recrystallization, preparative thin layer chromatography, column chromatography, etc. The follwing reference and working examples are given to further illustrate this invention but should by no means be construed as limiting its scope.
