# NMR BLOOD FLOW IMAGING

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for producing two dimensional, plan view images of in vivo blood flow networks using unique nuclear magnetic resonance NMR pulse sequences are dis closed. The method teaches the use of a pair of 90 selective pulses separated by a delay time optimized to provide images with enhanced blood flow contrast by discriminating against stationary media surrounding the blood flow path. For the in stant method, two dimensional images are compiled by the il lustrative apparatus using a collection of NMR slice data, wherein each slice reflects a one dimensional projection of NMR received signal data in a thin planar slab selected to be generally orthogonal to the primary blood flow network. Fur ther alternative embodiments discuss the use of free induction decay FID signals, as well as single pulse and multiple pulse spin echo sequences.
