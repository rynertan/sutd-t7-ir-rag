# Method and apparatus for testing fixed function logic circuits.

## Abstract
Testing the operation of a fixed function logic circuit 11 is accomplished by connecting the circuit into a feedback shift register divider 10 to form the feedback operator there of which corresponds to the logic function of the circuit. A fixed input is gated into the divider at each shift after which the contents of the shift register stages Î³
