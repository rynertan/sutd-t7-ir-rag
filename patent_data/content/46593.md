# Beam delivery apparatus.

## Abstract
A laser system 50 for medical applications has at least two lasers 52, 66 and a movable concave reflector 56. The lasers 52, 66 are capable of generating beams of coherent electromagnetic radiation 51, 68. One of the beams, an aiming beam, is aligned to impinge the reflector, to reflect therefrom and to impinge a biological specimen 57. The reflector 56 is moved until the beam is aligned to impinge the desired position. The reflector is held stationary and the second beam is generated. The second beam is also aligned to impinge the reflector to reflect therefrom and to impinge the same desired position as that impinged by the first beam.
