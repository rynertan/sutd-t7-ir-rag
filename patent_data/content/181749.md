# Molybdenum dioxo dialkyleneglycolates, a method of producing them and their use as catalysts in the epoxidation of olefins.

## Abstract
Production of novel molybdenum dioxo dialkyleneglyco late compositions, especially adapted for use as catalysts in the epoxidation of olefinic compounds with an organic hydroperoxide, by reaction of molybdenum trioxide with particular dialkylene glycol componds at specified elevated temperatures while removing water.
