SPECIFICATION HYDRAULIC INORGANIC COMPOSITION 1. Technical Field This invention relates to a hydraulic inorganic composition having high hydraulic caking speed, and per mitting the rigid hydrate thereof to exhibit a rapid curing property, exceedingly high mechanical strength, low specific gravity, high corrosion resistance and appreciable curing expansion. That is, this invention relates to an improved slag cement containing a large amount of gypsum.2. Background Art Heretofore, it has been known to the art that a. hydraulic inorganic composition prepared by adding 10 to 20 parts by weight of lightly calcined anhydrous gypsum or gypsum hemihydrate and not more than 5 parts by weight of portland cement or calcium hydroxide to about 80 parts by weight of a fine powder of granulated slag of blast furnace having a potential hydraulic property, namely, a so called high sulfate slag cement , can be used singly as a cheap cement substantially equal in properties to portland cement, or as a mixture with portland cement. cif. Japanese EncyclopaediaChimica , Vol. 5, 1961, page 204, and Japanese PatentApplication Publication No. 2617 64, page 6. However, the rigid hydrate of high sulfate slag cement of this kind tends to receive weathering on the surface thereof, so that this slag cement has been scarcely put to a practical use.3. Disclosure of Invention An object of this invention is to improve the above mentioned high sulfate slag cement, and to provide a hydraulic inorganic composition which produces a rigid hydrate exhibiting a rapid caking and curing properties, high mechanical strength, high corrosion resistance, appreciable curing expansion and high weathering resistance, and further can be used with or without mixing of aggregate. The object of this invention has been achieved by preparing a composition of the following components.Specifically, the composition of this invention contains, as two main components, about 80 parts by weight of fine powder of granulated blast furnace slag and about 20 parts by weight of a lightly calcined anhydrous gypsum or gypsum hemihydrate, as well as 0.1 to 5.0 parts by weight of additives including at least one compound acting as an alkaline curing irritant selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, calcium oxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and calcium carbonate, and at least another compound acting as a neutral or nearly neutral curing accelerator selected from the group consisting of magnesium hydroxide, aluminium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, aluminium oxide, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, magnessium chloride, aluminium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, aluminium sulfate and magnesium carbonate the weight ratio of the alkaline curing irritant to the curing accelerator ranging between 1 1 and 1 6. In place of calcium oxide used as a curing irritant mentioned above, it is possible to use portland cement containing fine free crystals of calcium oxide in the matrix of cement clinker substance. The composition of this invention exhibits a markedly rapid caking property. Specifically, the initial and final times of hydrate caking of this composition at a temperature of 200C are about 5 minutes and 7 minutes, respectively, as seen in many Examples hereinafter described, in contrast to about 2.5 hours and 3. 5 hours for the conventional portland cement or a conventional high sulfate slag cement, respectively, and about 4 hours and 5.5 hours for a portland cement mixed with 60 by weight of fine powder of granulated slag, respectively. The average values of bending strength and compressive strength of the rigid hydrate of the present composition mixed with sand are shown in Table 1.

The other conditions were the same as those specified in said JIS R 5201. Table 2 shows the results of comparative tests for bending strength and compressive strength applied to the rigid hydrates of an ordinary portland cement, early high strength portland cement and conventional high sulfate slag cement.

The conventional portland cement gives rise to some shrinkage of volume in the hydration step. Therefore, the rigid hydrate of portland cement alone is always accompanied with cracks. In order to avoid the crack occurrence, at least 2 parts by weight of sand should be mixed therewith as an aggregate to 1 part by weight of the cement. This accounts for the specification of JISR 5201 that the standard sand twice the amount of the cement should be mixed at the preparation of the cement paste. However, a slight curing expansion is accompanied with the cement of this invention even when a paste of the cement alone is cured, so that any crack does not occur in the cured substance at all. In the test of mechanical strength with the cement of this invention mentioned afore, the mixing ratio of cement to standard sand was set at 1 1 in order to make the test conditions close to those specified in JIS R 5201. Of cource, it is possible practically to mix aggregates such as sand, gravel and crushed rock in view of economy with regard to the cement of this invention. However, this invention is featured in that a paste or sludge of this invented cement alone can be used as a molding, filling or wall covering material without using any aggregate. Particularly, in the case of single use of the cement of this invention, the rigid hydrate obtained exhibits mechanical strengths wonderfully higher than those in the cases of conventional aggregate mixed cements as seen from Examples described later. The hydraulic inorganic composition of this invention is a cement prepared by adding a small amount of novel curing accelerator to the known slag cement containing a large amount of calcium sulfate, said slag cement containing a small amount of conventional alkaline curing irritant. Although the physical or chemical reasion for the above noted prominent effects brought by the addition of a small amount of curing accelerator has not yet been clarified, it is supposed that a particular synergistic effect would be produced by the alkaline curing irritant and the curing accelerator, leading to the faborable results described afore. As mentioned previously, it is possible to mix aggregates such as sand, gravel and crushed rock with the cement of this invention. It is also possible to use as the aggregate a granulated blast furnace slag, which is not pulverized and has an appropriate grain size. In this case, the surface of granulated slag will show a slight activity in the reaction of rigid hydrate, being advantageous over the general aggregates. In contrast to at least 2.4 of specific gravity of the rigid hydrates of ordinary cements, the rigid hydrate of the cement alone of this invention has a specific gravity of 1.8 at most. This property of lightness is very advantageous in the design and engineering of public work and architecture in general. In addition, the rigid hydrate of this single cement forms a dense coagulation which contributes to low water permeability and high resistance to weathering for a long period of time. Furthermore, this rigid and light hydrate has a fire resistance, so that it can be used as a fire resistant material or thermal insulating material. In general, the blast furnace slag contains as main components 30 to 35 by weight of SiO2, 15 to 20 by weight of AP203 and 40 to 50 by weight of CaO as well as small amounts of Fe203 and MgO. By rapid cooling of this liquid slag flown out of a blast furnace with a torrent of water, a granular substance having a particle size distribution of wide range can be obtained. This substance has a potential hydraculic property. One of the main raw materials of the cement of this invention is prepared by pulverizing the thus obtained dry granulated slag to the extent of portland cement. If necessary, it is possible to mix a required amount of an ordinary cement as a bulk filler with the cement of this invention. The ordinary cements include portland cement, early high strength portland cement, alumina cement, and white cement. It is also possible to add a weight saving material such as fine powder of perlite in order to make the cured cement more light weight. When the composition of this invention is to be caked slowly, it is sufficed by adding a suitable amount of known caking retardant such as glue, gelatin, peptone, starch, sodium lignin sulfonate, sodium tartarate, sodium succinate, borax and sodium phosphate. When the composition of this invention is used as a grouting material, which requires a rapid caking property, it is better to add to suitable amount of known caking activator such as NH4 2SO4 CaSO4, ZnSO4, FeSO4, CuSO4, NaHSO4, KHSO4, or collidal silica. Since the rigid hydration of this cement accompanies some curing expansion as described previously, the composition of this invention is very suitable for the material of grouting.4. Best Mode of Carrying Out the InventionExample 1 A composition of this invention was obtained by adding 0.5 part by weight of slaked lime as an alkaline curing irritant and 1.0 part by weight of magnesia as a curing accelerator to a mixture of 80 parts by weight of granulated blast furnace slag dried and pulverized to the extent of portland cement and 20 parts by weight of by product gupsum hemihydrate. A paste prepared by adding 40 parts by weight of water to the composition obtained, followed by kneading, was found to exhibit a flow value of about 200 mm as determined by the method specified in JIS R 5201. The paste was also subjected to a caking test under JIS R 5201, with a result that the initial and final times of hydrate caking were found to be 5 minutes and 7 minutes, respectively.

Since this special method was not specified in JIS, the following specifically determined method was employed. That is, a cylindrical tube, of which inner diameter and height being 50 mm and 100 mm, respectively, was set up on the center of level surface of a glass plate having 500 mm x 500 mm area. After pouring the sample of the above mentioned sludge into the cylindrical tube in full volume, only the cylindrical tube was removed promptly on the upward direction, with the result of wide spreading of the sludge on the glass plate. Then, the largest diameter of the spread and the diameter of rectangular direction thereto were measured.The average of these two diameters was acknowledged as the flow value in this case. The sludye thus obtained was poured into an open broad box having a depth of 15 mm, so that the surface of poured sludge was naturally maintained horizontal.The sludge exhibited initial and final times of hydrate caking of about 2 hours and 3.5 hours, respectively, as well as a specific gravity of 2.0. The rigid molded mass was taken out of the open box and cured at a temperature of 200C under a natural atmosphere for 28 days, thereby obtaining a tough plate of light weight having a smooth surface. The plate obtained had a bending strength of 63 kg cm2 and a compressive strength of 210 kg cm2. The above mentioned method could permit a smooth floor finishing only by pouring the sludge onto a rough surface of concrete floor without a leveling step. 5. Industrial Applicability Compared with all the conventional cements, the cement of this invention exhibits extremely rapid hydrate caking properties, and permits to provide a rigid hydrate having exceedingly high mechanical strength, low specific gravity, slight curing expansivity and freedom from weathering. Further, two main raw materials of granulated slag and gypsum are very cheap by products of blast furnace and fuel desulfurizing operation. There is no neccesity of making a clinker with a result of fuel saving. The additives are also very cheap material. Therefore, the cement of this invention can be utilized far effectively, efficiently and economically than ever for general engineering works, construction works, wall coating works, production of molded articles, grouting works and repairing works in place of the conventional cements.
