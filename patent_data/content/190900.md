Examples of a protecting group for a carboxy or carboxyloweralkenyl group in the definitions of R5 andR20 are those which can be released easily under mild conditions, e.g. tri lower alkylsilyl such as trimethylsilyl, benzhydryl, g methylsulfonylethyl, phenacyl, p methoxybenzyl, tert butyl, and p nitrobenzyl groups.Practical reaction conditions of Process A It is preferred that the reaction is performed in organic solvents which do not take part in the reaction. Examples of such solvents are dichloromethane, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, benzene, toluene, chloroform, ethyl acetate, ether, tetrahydrofuran dioxane. Equimolar or excess amount of either of the starting materials Compounds II and or III may be used in the reaction. The reaction proceeds easily at room temperature or under cooling. The removal of protecting groups from the reaction product is easily performed. For example, when the group is triloweralkylsilyl, its removal is easily performed by contact with water when the group is benzhydryl, trityl, tert butyl, or formyl, its removal is easily performed by treatment with acid such as formic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid anisole mixture, hydrobromic acid acetic acid mixture, hydrochloric acid dioxane mixture.Practical reaction conditions of Process B and Process C In these reaction schemes, Process C means the reaction course formula VI compound formulaIV compound formula I compound Process B means only its second step formula IV compound y formula I compound. For example, a formula VI compound in the case of .R5 and R7 being hydrogen and R9 being acetoxy or halogen , or in the case of 7 amino being protected1 is reacted with a formula VII compound namely, l substituted 2 or 4 thiopyridone or l substituted 3 mercapto pyridinium in a solvent which does not take part in the reaction. For promoting the reaction, a catalyst of a salt e.g. KI, No.I , an acid such as aLewis acid e.g. baron trifluororide, ether , chloro sulfuric acid, fluorosuIfonic acid, trifluoromethane sulfuric acid may be preferrably added to the reaction system. In the case of an acid being added for promoting the reaction, the formed compound is obtained as the corresponding salt, which is easily converted to the free coucund by conventional methods e.g. by subjecting the salt to column chromatography, e.g. ion exchange column chromatography on Diaion HP 20 Mitsubishi Chemical Co., Japan , etc.This first step reaction VI IV may be performed by reacting 7 aminocephalosporanic acid or its derivative in the case of R9 being halogen a formula VI compound with N,O bis triloweralkylsilyl triEluoroacetamide to protect an amino group and or a carboxy group with silyl type group s , and then reacting the resulting protected compound with a formula VII compound.The second step Process B can be performed by reacting the formula IV compound obtained in the first step with a formula V compound namely, 2 substituted 4 thiazolyl J substitutediminoacetic acid or its reactive derivative . The compound IV may be an inner salt that is, COOR8 COOe or, in the case of R8 being a protective group, may be a salt in the case of S being an anion. Reaction of compounds V and IV is usually performed in a solvent under cooling or at room temperature.Any solvent which does not take part in the reaction may be used and examples of the solvents are water and organic solvents such as acetone, dioxane, ether, tetrahydrofuran, ebI methylketone, chloroform, dichloroethane, ethyl acetate, ethyl formate, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide these solvents may be used alone or in appropriate combination. The compound V may be a free carboxylic acid or a reacive derivative thereof. Suitable examples of such reactive derivative are active esters e.g. benzotriazole ester , mixed acid anhydrides, acid anhydrides, acid halides, active amides, and acid azides. When using a free carboxylic acid V, it is preferred to use a condensing agent such as N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or N,N diethylcarbodiimide.When using a reactive derivative of a carboxylic acid it may be pwEerred for smooth reaction to operate in ti presence of a base. Examples of such a. base are inorganic bases such as sodium hydrogencarbonate potassium hydrogencarbonate, sodium carbonate, and potassium carbonate and organic bases such as trimethylamine, triethylamine and dimethylaniline, and pyridine. Practical reaction conditions of Process D The reaction is usually performed by stirring compound VIII or a salt thereof and compound VII in water, phosphoric acid buffer, or other inert solvent or a mixture thereof.Examples of inert solvent for this purpose are alcohols such as methanol, ethanol amides such as dimethylformamide, acetamide and acetones and acetonitriles. For promoting the reaction, a catalyst such as potassium iodide, potassium bromide, sodium bromide, or potassium thiocyanate may be added to the reaction system in an excess amount. The reaction proceeds easily at room temperature or under heating. Compounds shown by the following formula are according to the invention and can be obtained by the first step of Process C EMI22.1 wherein R3 is as defined above, n is 1, 2 or 3, and D is a lower alkyl groups. A salt of the formula I compound can be produced by performing a foregoing production process using a salt of the starting compound, or by applying a salt forming reaction to the free formula I compound The formula I compounds and salts can be separated and purified in conventional manner, such as extraction with organic solvent, crystallization, or column chromato graphy.
