# A rotary fluid machine, such as an engine, a pump, a compressor, a brake.

## Abstract
A rotary fluid machine of the kind that is to be actuated by any fluid under pressure in which a rotor 15 carrying a piston member 15₄ rotates continuously when the machine is in operation about the axis AA1 of an annular chamber 21 , the piston member 15₄ is geared to a rotary obturator 17A, 17B that rotates in a sealing chamber about an axis BB1, CC1 substantially parallel to said axis AA1 of the annular chamber 21 and the rotary obturator has a recess into which a part of the piston enters during rotation to provide a working section in the cylinder as working fluid is fed to the piston. The machine is characterised in that the piston member 15₄ has a frusto conical peripheral surface G1, G2 that seals with a frusto conical mating surface of its annular chamber, the two surfaces being kept into sealing contact by an axial force of the axis AA1 of a right cone common to both said surfaces.
