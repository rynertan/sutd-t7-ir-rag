# SURFACE TREATMENT WHEELS AND SHOES FOR SUPPORTING A MOVING BELT

## Abstract
A shoe 1 for supporting a belt, e.g. a sanding belt has a belt supporting surface 2 non linear in cross section per pendicular to the direction of belt extension and shaped such that a belt may bend sharply around the surface 2 in its direction of extension whilst conforming to the surface 2 without stretching. A sanding wheel comprises a plurality of such shoes 1 arranged as spokes of the wheel, which may be unitary in construction, and having a sanding belt extending around the wheel.
