For example, metal salts can be made by contacting compounds of Formula I with a solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt having a sufficiently basic anion e.g., hydroxide, alkoxide or carbonate . Quaternary amine salts can be made by similar techniques. Salts of compounds of Formula I can also be prepared by exchange of one cation for another. Cationic exchange can be effected by direct contact of an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I e.g., alkali or quaternary amine salt with a solution containing the cation to be exchanged. This method is most effective when the desired salt containing the exchanged cation is insoluble in water and can be separated by filtration. Exchange may also be effected by passing an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I e.g., an alkali metal or quaternary amine salt through a column packed with a cation exchange resin containing the cation to be exchanged for that of the original salt and the desired product is eluted from the column. This method is particularly useful when the desired salt is water soluble, e.g., a potassium sodium or calcium salt. Acid addition salts, useful in this invention, can be obtained by reacting a compound of Formula I with a suitable acid, e.g., The preparation of the compounds of this invention is further illustrated by the following specific examples.

Useful formulations of the compounds of Formula I be prepared in conventional ways. They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly. Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about 0.1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid inert diluent s . More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E. Browning, Agglomeration , For further information regarding the art of formulation, see for example In the following examples, all parts are by weight unless otherwise indicated. The ingredients are blended, hammer milled until all the solids are essentially under 50 microns, reblended, and packaged. The ingredients are blended, coarsely hammer milled and then air milled to produce particles essentially all below 10 microns in diameter. The product is reblended before packaging. A slurry of wettable powder containing 25 solids is sprayed on the surface of attapulgite granules in a double cone blender. The granules are dried and packaged. The ingredients are blended, hammer milled and then moistened with about 12 water. The mixture is extruded as cylinders about 3 mm diameter which are cut to produce pellets about 3 mm long. These may be used directly after drying, or the dried pellets may be crushed to pass a U.S.S. No. 20 sieve 0.84 mm openings . The granules held on a U.S.S. No. 40 sieve 0.42 mm openings may be packaged for use and the fines recycled. The active ingredient is dissolved in a solvent and the solution is sprayed upon dedusted granules in a double cone blender. After spraying of the solution has been completed, the material is warmed to evaporate the solvent. The material is allowed to cool and then packaged. The ingredients are blended and milled to pass through a 100 mesh screen. This material is then added to a fluid bed granulator, the air flow is adjusted to gently fluidize the material, and a fine spray of water is sprayed onto the fluidized material. The fluidization and spraying are continued until granules of the desired size range are made. The spraying is stopped, but fluidization is continued, optionally with heat, until the water content is reduced to the desired level, generally less than 1 . The material is then discharged, screened to the desired size range, generally 14 100 mesh 1410 149 microns , and packaged for use. The active ingredient is dissolved in the solvent and the solution is sprayed upon dedusted granules in a double cone blender. After spraying of the solution has been completed, the blender is allowed to run for a short period and then the granules are packaged. The ingredients are blended and ground together in a sand mill to produce particles essentially all under 5 microns in size. The salt is added directly to the water with stirring to produce the solution, which may then be packaged for use. The ingredients are blended and ground in a hammer mill to produce a material essentially all passing a U.S.S. No. 50 screen 0.3 mm opening . The concentrate may be formulated further if necessary. The ingredients are blended and ground in a hammer mill to produce particles essentially all below 100 microns. The material is sifted through a U.S.S. No. 50 screen and then packaged. The ingredients are thoroughly blended, coarsely hammer milled and then air milled to produce particles essentially all below 10 microns in size. The material is reblended and then packaged. The ingredients are combined and ground together in a sand mill to produce particles essentially all below 5 microns. The product can be used directly, extended with oils, or emulsified in water. The active ingredient is blended with attapulgite and then passed through a hammer mill to produce particles substantially all below 200 microns. The ground concentrate is then blended with powdered pyrophyllite until homogeneous. The ingredients are ground together in a sand mill until the solid particles have been reduced to under about 5 microns. The resulting thick suspension may be applied directly, but preferably after being extended with oils or emulsified in water. The ingredients are thoroughly blended. After grinding in a hammer mill to produce particles essentially all below 100 microns, the material is reblended and sifted through a U.S.S. No. 50 sieve 0.3 mm opening and packaged. Other formulations may be prepared analogously to Examples 29 to 45 of our EP A 207 609. The compounds of the present invention ore expected to be highly active preemergent or postemergent herbicides or plant growth regulants. Many of them should have utility for broad spectrum pre and or post emergence weed control in areas where complete control of all vegetation is desired, such as around fuel storage tanks, ammunition depots, industrial storage areas, parking lots, drive in theaters, around billboards, highway and railroad structures. Some of the compounds should have utility for selective weed control in crops such as rice and wheat. Alternatively, the subject compounds should be useful to modify plant growth. The rates of application for the compounds of the invention are determined by a number of factors, including their use as plant growth modifiers or as herbicides, the crop species involved, the types of weeds to be controlled, weather and climate, formulations selected, mode of application, amount of foliage present, etc. In general terms, the subject compounds should be applied at levels of around 0.01 to 10 kg ha, the lower rates being suggested for use on lighter soils and or those having a low organic matter content, for plant growth modification or for situations where only short term persistence is required. Those compounds which exhibited no activity at test rates indicated in the biological tables are expected to show activity at higher application rates. The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with any other commercial herbicide, examples of which are those of the triazine, triazole, uracil, urea, amide, diphenylether, carbamate and bipyridylium types. The herbicidal properties of the subject compounds were discovered in a number of greenhouse tests. The test procedures and results follow. Seeds of crabgrass
