# RADIAL NEUTRON REFLECTOR

## Abstract
The invention relates to nuclear reactors using light water as a coolant. The space defined between the reactor core and the barrel around it has therein neutron reflecting structure, such as zirconia rods 25, 31 , stacked zirconia blocks or stainless steel plates, for example, arranged to reflect, back into the reactor core, radially escaping neutrons which, in the absence of the reflecting structure, would be absorbed by the volume of reactor coolant now displaced by the structure.
