## Description
The present invention relates to cemented carbide bodies preferably used in tools for drilling of rock and mineral. Tools for cutting of asphalt and concrete are also included. Up to now, it has been generally accepted that cemented carbide for the above mentioned applications shall have a two phase composition i.e. consist of uniformly distributed WC alpha phase and cobalt beta phase . Presence of free carbon or intermediate phases such as M₆ carbide, W₃Co₃C eta phase because of high or low contents of carbon, respectively has been considered as harmful for said products by the experts. Practical experience has confirmed the above mentioned opinion, in particular concerning low carbon phases such as eta phase, where said phase has been distributed in the entire cemented carbide body or located to the surface. The reason for said negative results is the more brittle behaviour of the eta phase, i.e. microcracks, starting in the surface, are often initiated in the eta phase and the cemented carbide body will easily break. FR A 2,331,407 discloses a carbide body comprising a core, a first outer layer of a metal i.e. Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta carbide, a second outer layer of a metal carbonitride, and a third outermost layer of a metal nitride. The core consists of a mixture of sintered carbide, in particular carbides of W, Ti, Ta, Nb and mixtures thereof and more particularly WC, and binder phase in particular Co and Ni and has a superficial zone containing an eta phase. In percussive rock drilling there are two types of tools, such as tools with brazed inserts and tools with pressed in buttons. A desire is to increase the wear resistance of the cemented carbide which is normally obtained by decreasing the content of cobalt. Cemented carbide with a low content of cobalt means, however, that rock drilling inserts can not be brazed because of risks for breakage in consequence of brazing stresses. Nowadays, button bits are used to a great extent, at which a low content of cobalt can be used. At the fitting of the buttons a gap is often formed in the top part of the contact surface between button and steel in the bit because of the hole drilling. Said gap grows when the bit is used and it leads eventually to fracture, which can happen relatively close to the bottom face of the button. It has now been surprisingly found, however, that a remarkable improvement of the strength can be obtained if the cemented carbide bodies are made under such conditions that a region with finely and uniformly distributed eta phase embedded in the normal alpha beta phase structure is created in the centre of said bodies. At the same time, there shall be a surrounding surface zone with only alpha beta phase. With eta phase we mean low carbon phases of the W C Co system such as the M₆C and M₁₂C carbides and kappa phase with the approximate formula M₄C. It is necessary that the surface zone is completely free of eta phase in order to maintain the excellent fracture strength properties of the WC Co cemented carbide. The zone free of eta phase can for example be made by addition of carbon at high temperature to cemented carbide bodies having eta phase throughout. By varying time and temperature, a zone free of eta phase with desired thickness can be obtained. The invention is more precisely defined in the appended claims. The greater strength of the body can be explained as follows. The eta phase core has greater stiffness than the WC Co cemented carbide which means that the body is exposed to smaller elastic deformation leading to smaller tensile stresses in the critical surface zone when the body is loaded when drilling. The consequence is that the invention is particularly suited for bodies such as buttons where the ratio between the height and the maximum width is greater than 0.75, preferably greater than 1.25. The content of binder phase shall be small in the outer part of the zone free of eta phase, i.e. lower than nominal content of binder phase. It has also been found that the content of binder phase i.e. the content of cobalt, shall be considerably higher, i.e. higher than the nominal one, in the inner part of the zone free of eta phase. The cobalt rich zone leads to compressive stresses in the surface zone and has also positive effects on strength and toughness. The result is a tool having greater wear resistance and which stands higher loads and which can also be brazed. As the drilling proceeds, the buttons obtain an increasing wear flat, which in its turn will give rise to an increased mechanical stress. The contact surface between cemented carbide and rock increases, the forces become soon very high upon the buttons and the risk of breaking increases. Buttons with an eta phase core according to the invention can have considerably greater wear flats compared to conventional buttons because of the substantially increased rigidity and strength. The reason for regrinding conventional buttons is among other things to remove the wear flat in order to decrease the stress, i.e. the risk of fracture. Regrinding could thus be avoided to an increased extent by using buttons according to the invention . Cemented carbide containing eta phase has generally a higher hardness than corresponding material with the same composition but being free of eta phase. As will be evident from the following examples, the performance increasing effect of the eta phase core cannot be explained by the higher hardness, i.e. an increased wear resistance. The WC Co variant having a hardness corresponding to the eta phase variant has in all the examples shown inferior performance. The eta phase shall be fine grained with a grain size of 0.5 10 µm, preferably 1 5 µm, and uniformly distributed in the matrix of the normal WC Co structure in the centre of the cemented carbide body. It has been found that the thickness of the eta phase core shall be 10 95 , preferably 30 65 , of the width of the cemented carbide body to make good results obtainable. The core should contain at least 2 by volume, preferably at least 10 by volume, of eta phase because no effect will be obtained otherwise, but at the most 60 by volume, preferably at the most 35 by volume. In the zone free of eta phase the content of binder phase, i.e. in general the content of cobalt, shall in the surface be 0.1 0.9, preferably 0.2 0.7, of the nominal content of binder phase. It shall gradually increase up to at least 1.2, preferably 1.4 2.5, of the nominal content of binder phase at the boundary close to the eta phase core. The width of the zone poor of binder phase shall be 0.2 0.8, preferably 0.3 0.7, of the width of the zone free of eta phase, but at least 0.4 mm and preferably at least 0.8 mm in width. The positive increase of the performance is noticed at all cemented carbide grades being normally used in the above mentioned applications, from grades having 3 by weight of cobalt up to grades with 35 by weight of cobalt, preferably 5 10 by weight of cobalt for percussive rock drilling, 6 25 by weight of cobalt for rotary crushing rock drilling, and 6 13 of cobalt for mineral tools. The grain size of WC can vary from 1.5 µm up to 8 µm, preferably 2 5 µm. Fig. 1 shows a button according to the invention in longitudinal and cross section. In the figure, A indicates cemented carbide containing eta phase, B1 indicates cemented carbide free of eta phase and having a high content of cobalt, B2 indicates cemented carbide free of eta phase and having a low content of cobalt, and C indicates embedment mass bakelite . Fig. 2 shows the distribution of cobalt and tungsten along a diameter of the button in Fig. 1. It has also been found that the amount of cobalt in the eta phase can be wholly or partly replaced by any of the metals iron or nickel, i.e. the very eta phase can consist of one or more of the iron group metals in combination. Also in this case the performance of the cemented carbide is increased to a surprisingly great extent. In the text above as well as in the examples below, the positive effects of the eta phase in the centre of cemented carbide buttons are shown only in those cases where the alpha phase is WC and the beta phase is based upon one or more of the iron group metals iron, nickel or cobalt . Preliminary experiments have, however, given very promising results, also when at the most 15 by weight of tungsten in the alpha phase is substituted by one or more of the metallic carbide formers Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr and Mo. The text has only dealt with cemented carbide buttons for percussive rock drilling but it is evident that the invention can be applied to various kinds of cemented carbide bodies such as rock drilling inserts, wear parts or other parts exposed to wear. From a WC 6 cobalt powder with 0.3 substoichiometric carbon content 5.5 C instead of 5.8 C for conventional cemented carbide buttons were pressed having a height of 16 mm and a diameter of 10 mm. The buttons were pre sintered in N₂ gas for 1 h at 900 C and standard sintered at 1450 C. After that the buttons were sparsely packed in fine Al₂O₃ powder in graphite boxes and thermally treated in a carburizing atmosphere for 2 h at 1450 C in a pusher type furnace. At the initial stage of the sintering there was formed a structure of alpha beta phase and uniformly distributed, fine grained eta phase therein. At the same time there was formed in the surface of the buttons a very narrow zone of merely alpha beta structure because carbon begins to diffuse into the buttons and transform the eta phase to alpha beta phase. After 2 hours sintering time a sufficient amount of carbon had diffused and transformed all the eta phase in a wide surface zone. The buttons made in this way had after the sintering a 2 mm surface zone free of eta phase and a core with the diameter 6 mm containing finely distributed eta phase. The content of cobalt at the surface was 4.8 and immediately outside the eta phase 10.1 . The width of the part having a low content of cobalt was about 1 mm.
