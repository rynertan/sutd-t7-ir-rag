# Method of forming a decorative laminate decorative laminate and method of gluing decorative laminate to reinforcing substrate.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a method of forming a decorative heat and pressure consolidated laminate by assembling between platens a plurality of superimposed plies of thermo setting resin impregnated sheets and a release medium hav ing a transferable, gluable coating on the side of the release medium placed against an outermost ply, and applying heat and pressure through the platens to consolidate the laminate and to transfer the gluable coating from the release medium to the outermost ply. There is also disclosed a decorative heat and pressure consolidated laminate comprising a plural ity of superimposed plies of thermosetting resin impregnated sheets having on one of the outermost plies a gluable coating. There is further disclosed a method of gluing a decorative heat and pressure consolidated laminate to a reinforcing substrate without the need for sanding the back of the lami nate before gluing which comprises providing on one surface of the laminate a gluable coating applying a coating of glue between the gluable coating and the substrate and adhering the laminate to the substrate. The gluable coating comprises a linear copolymer of A maleic anhydride or maleic acid or maleic acid salt and B ethylene or a vinyl monomer having a side chain or an aliphatic group with up to four carbon atoms or an alkoxy group with up to four carbon atoms.
