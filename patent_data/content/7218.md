# Photosensitive coloured glasses exhibiting alterable photo anisotropic effects, production and use thereof.

## Abstract
A photosensitive coloured glass exhibiting alterable photo anisotropic effects and having a body portion and an integral hydrated surface layer, characterized in that the body portion comprises, in mole percent on the oxide basis, from 70 to 82 SiO₂ from 10 to 17 Na₂O and or K₂O from 5 to 15 ZnO, from 0.5 to 5 A1₂O₃ and from 0.1 to3 C1, and the surface layer, at least a portion of which exhibits photo dichroic and birefringent properties, has a thickness of from 1 to 500 microns, contains up to 10 , by weight, H₂O, contains Ag AgC1 containing crystals and contains up to 25 , by weight, Ag, the Na and or K content decreasing with increasing Ag content. A process for the production of such a glass characterized in that the anhydrous glass is contacted with an aqueous Ag containing solution having a pH of less than 2 at a temp erature in excess of 200 C and at a pressure in excess of 16 Kg sq.cm. and the resulting hydrated surface layer contain ing Ag AgC1 crystals is exposed to ultra violet radiation, is also disclosed. Such glasses may be used as optical information storage media. Referring to accompanying Figure 2, Curve A represents the general absorption spectrum of the solution ion exchanged products according to the present invention while Curve B represents that of the products according to pub lished G.B. Patent Application No. 2,006,748.
