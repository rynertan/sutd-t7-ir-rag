## Description
A PESTICIDAL COMPOSITION AND A METHOD FOR ITS PREPARATION This invention relates to a method of encapsulating a pesticide for the purpose of reducing the phyto toxicity to plants while essentially maintaining pesticidal activity. The invention also relates to an encapsulated pesticidal composition useful in such method, produced by drying a mixture of pesticide on a particulate carrier suspended in a polymer latex. Various methods for encapsulating are known. The following references disclose conventional methods U.S.P. 2,800,457, Green et al., July 23, 1957, teaches a method of making oil containing capsules by emulsifying oil in an aqueous sol using two hydrophilic colloidal materials having opposite electric charges, cooling the mixture and recovering the gelled product.U.S.P. 2,800,458, Green, July 23, 1967,discloses a saltcoacervation method for encapsulating oi using gellable hydrophilic colloidal material.U.S.P. 3,015,128, Somerville, January 2, 1962, deals with a centrifugal encapsulating apparatus for covering filler material such as kerosene with a medium such as a mixture of polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate in 2 water glycero solvent. U.s.P. 3,016,308, Macaulay, January 9, 1962,teaches rupturable capsules containing a liquid using ether a non ionizable water soluble or an hydrophobic water insoluble film former. U.S.P. 3,423,489, Arens et al., January 21, 1969, deals with an encapsulating process for liquid materials using two separate streams, one for the encapsulating material and the other for the liquid filler.U.S.P. 3,4290,827, Ruus, Febfruary 25, 1969, discloses a process for encapsulating substances such as liquids or dispersions in a shell based on condensation polymers using two separate polymer reactants, such polymer being formed at the interface of the substance within the reaction medium. Many chemicals useful for the control of pests such as insects, acarids, fungi, etc. may cause phytotoxicity to the leaves of plants or trees sensitive to such chemicals when applied at pesticidally effective concentrations. The results are loss of green leaf surface or partial defoliation of the plant as well as reduction of yield and possible loss ot plants. It is important to maintain pesticidal activity of such chemicals while reducing the phytotoxicity of the active material to the plants. It has been found that the phytotoxic effects of such chemicals can be greatly reduced or completely eliminated when the pesticide is applied to z particu late carrier material and the resulting carrier pesticide combination is subsequently encapsulatea with a polymer material. Concentrations of pesticide cn carrier water ials may typlcally be from 5 to Bo percent, preferably 20 to 65 percent by weight, largely depending on the ability of the carrier to absorb the chemical.Typical carrier material is a finely divided powder such as diatomaceous earth, in which category is included equivalent materials derived from diatomaceous earth, having a small particle size e.g. surface area of 5 to 200 m 2 g, preferably 10 to 95 m 2 g . The pesticide may be a liquid or solid but is preferably liquid. The pesticide may be an acariclde e.g., a sulfite acaricide , insecticide, fungicide, etc. The pesticide on carrier particles are ordinarily dispersed in water using a mixture of dispersing and wetting agents such zs sodium ligncsulecnate and ncr ionic surfactants for producing an aqueous dispersion or pesticide on the carrier. Other surfactants which can be used are polymerized salts of alkyl naphthalene sulfonic acid and the sodium sulfosuccinates. Latex is then added to the water surfactant pesticide carrier slurry with agitation sufficient to disperse the carrier and pesticide particles throughout the latex. If nec essay, such latexes may be further stabilized by the addition of suitable stabilizers such as polyvinyl alcohol or hydroxyethyl cellulose.The latex particle size may typically vary from 0.1 to 25 microns, preferably 0.5 to 8 microns, in diameter. Some thickening of the slurry occurs when the latex is combined with the pesticide on carrier water slurry. Usually, water is added to the slurs reducing the final solids to about 30 , which results in a slurry viscosity of from 25 to 250 centipoise. A dry powdery product is obtained b drying the latex carrier pesticide suspension, typically by passing the suspension through a spray dryer, for example at a temperature of from 120 to 2200 C. The choice of spray drying equipment is not critical although spray dryers where the suspension is introduced from the top into the hot air stream are frequently more desirable. When a mixture of relatively large and small particle size latexes is used, a more uniform polymer coating of the carrier pesticide may be achieved. Additional surfactants may be added to the particles for better wetting and dispersion when the product is used in a spray solution to be applied to a crop. A typical process for making the product may be summarized as follows 1. Mix carrier and liquid or solid pesticide at about room temperature to 100 C maximum. 2. Add carrier pesticide particles to water containing dispersing and or wetting agents while agitating. 3. Add latex rcontaining polyvinyl acetate polymer or other suitable polymer to suspension achieved by step 2 with agitation. 4. Pass product of step 3 through spray dryer. Optionally, a portion of the dispersing wetting agents may be added to the product achieved by step 1 . Additional surfactant can be mixed with the product of step 4 to assure good dispersion of the product when used in a spray application.Example 1Preparation of Encapsulated Acaricide. A 2 4 1,1 dimethylethyl phenoxy cyclohexyl 2 propynyl sulfite a liquid, also known as propargite at about 500C is sprayed onto diatomaceous earth sur face arwea 95 mÃª g in a ribbon blender. Surfactants indicated in the recipe below are then added while agi tating and the mixture is hammer milled. Eight separate preparations are prepared and combined.The following recipe wherein parts are expressed by weight is used Propargite, 84.6 active 286 parts Diatomaceous earth 240 parts Highly purified sodium 2 parts lignosulfonate Octyiphenoxy polyethox 2 parts yethanol absorbed on mag nesium carbonate Polymerized sodium salts 2 parts of alkyl naphthalene sulfonic acid The product A contains 46.7 of active acari cide.

The acaricide on dato maceous earth is then added as rapidly as the slurry permits. The polymer latex is added with stirring.The slurry is spray dried at 110 nil per minute at an input temperature of 2200 C. After drying, sample 1 contains 37.7 active ingredient, sample 2 contains 35.0 , while sample 3 contains 39.3 acaricide. Sample 4, which is a control sample that is outside the invention, included for purposes of comparison only, is prepared by spraylng the acaricide into a mixture of the fillers and then adding surfactants. Hammer milling is used to make the product uniform. The resulting product contains 31 active acaricide. Acaricidal Test C The ability of these formulations to kill two spotted spider mites is determined using the following procedure Cowpea Vigna sinensis Germaine s Blackeye 5 are planted, 3 seeds per pot. When grown to first trifoliate stage, each pot is thinned to the best two plants. These are sprayed with a JGA 502 Devilbiss trademark spray gun for 20 seconds each pot. Spray solutions are made using added tion of water to bring solutions to concentration indicated in Table I. 1, 8, 14 and 28 days after spraying, twospotted spider mites are applied to each leaf inside a Tanglefoot trademark circle on the top of each leaf. The number of live mites remaining seven days after application is counted. The percent control is calculated using the following equation control number of live minutes in untreated check 100 x number of live mites sample number of live mites in untreated check number of live mites in untreated checkThe results are summarized in Table I.

Herbicidal Test D The effect of these treatments on te phytotoxicity of acaricide to cowpeas is tested as in C except mites are not applied. Higher concentrations of acaricide are used to exaggerate possible phytotoxic effects. The samples are rated 7 days after spraying. The degree of damage produced is determined, and the results shown in Table II are obtained.

Damage to the trifoliates which are just emerging when the sprays are applied represent curling, twisting and stunting of the leaf growth. These results show that as the polymer weight percentage is increased the phytotoxic effect of the pesticide is considerabi reduced. Example 3 The samples prepared in Example 2 are evaluated on 3 year old Bartlett pear treesThe entire leaf surface is treated, and each solution is applied to runoff at the two applications rates used.Phytotoxicity readings are taken 14 days after spraying, with the results shown in Table VI.
