# PLASMA CATHODE ELECTRON BEAM GENERATING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for generating an electron beam using a new and improved plasma cathode system, the electron beam being suitable for use, by way of example, in large area pulsed x ray devices of the type used for preionization of the discharge volume in certain lasers. The plasma cathode includes an electrically conductive member 12, 17 surrounded by an insulating sleeve 11 with an outer electrically conductive member 13, the first mentioned mem ber 12, 17 and a remote anode 16 being at ground potential, while the outer member 13 is maintained at a high negative potential relative to the first mentioned member 12, 17 and the anode 16.
