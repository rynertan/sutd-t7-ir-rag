# Apparatus for sorting sheets according to their patterns.

## Abstract
Apparatus for sorting banknotes in accordance with the printed patterns on their surfaces comprises an illumination source 5 for illuminating the banknote scanning means 1 , for example an array of photo detectors, for collecting light from a plurality of illumi nated pixels of the pattern means for moving the bank note relative to the scanning means and an analogue to digital converter 6 responsive to signals from the scanning means representative of the intensity ot light from each pixel, to produce intensity signals in digital form a digital memory 7 for storing the digital signals digital correlator means 8, 13 for correlating the stored signals with a preciously stored set of signals repre sentative of a set or standard patterns, the correlation being performed pixel by pixel and sorting means, responsive to the result of the correlation to divert the banknote in accordance with the most likely match.
