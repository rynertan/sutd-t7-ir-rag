# Powered cord reeling device with automatic cord tension controlled disengagement and typewriter carriage return mechanism using same.

## Abstract
The cord reeling device 18 includes a cord tension sensing mechanism 112, 114, 106 for detecting the increase tension of cord 80 when a driven load, such as the paper carriage of a typewriter, ceases to move and the drive mechanism continues to operate. It is desirable to disengage the drive mechanism at that point rather than to cause frictional wear or overloading of the motor pending a predetermined amount of driving time prior to disengage ment. Upon the cord tension reaching a preset value, a clutch pawl 82 will disengage a drive clutch 70 and prevent further wear of the clutching arrangement. To prevent premature disengagement of clutch 70 , a shock unloading pretensioned spring 39 is incorporated in the drive unit 24 to absorb the initial shocks and forces experienced during acceleration of the load driven by cord 80 .
