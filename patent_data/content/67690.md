# Methacrylate polymer concrete mix with reduced shrinkage during cure.

## Abstract
A curable liquid mixture for use in making a methacry late polymer concrete comprises a methacrylate monomer, a paraffinic oil containing at least 60 by weight of saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons and having a boiling point above 200 C, and 4 to 10 by weight of an acrylic polymer. The liquid mixture reduces the tendencv of uncured methacrylate polymer concrete to shrink during curing.
