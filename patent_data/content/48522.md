## Description
A plastics piDe part provided with an outer foam plastics insulating layer.The invention relates to a plastics pipe part provided with an outer foam plastics insulating layer the outer side of same being surrounded by a tubular casing.A plastics composite insulated pipe part of this type is known in the art.Said knawn pipe parts consist, however, of rather rigid material, which will, after extrusion and cooling rapidly obtain their form stability.These pipe parts present the disadvantage of not being flexible so that they can only be installed in straight lengths and very special auxiliary parts have to be used for forming bends. n installing plastics pipe parts for conveying heated fluids for heating houses and edifices it is therefore recommended to use flexible plastics pipe parts which can be installed in any desired bend while moreover only a restricted number of connections are present between the pipe parts as these connections might give rise to leakages or other undesired phenomena.The above implies that not only the plastics pipe parts and the tubular casing but also the foam plastics insulating layer should consist of flexible material. Known flexible foam plastics materials are, however, generally insufficiently high temperature resistant to be used as an insulating material for pipes destined for conveying heating fluids. Known foam plastics materials which are sufficiently high temperature resistant, consist mostly of rigid foam materials.The present invention aims to provide a pipe part of the abovementioned type, comprising an insulating layer being sufficiently flexible on the one hand and sufficiently high tempersture resistant on the other hand.This object is stained according to the invention in that a flexible plastics pipe part is provided with an insulating layer formed from a band of a reticulated thermoplastics foam, having a reticulating degree comprised between 10z and 70 . The reticulating degree is based on the amount of gel of the materialThe aforementioned lower limit of the reticulating degree is very essential as a thermoplastics foam having a reticulating degree below the relative minimum value, presents the disadvantage of a too low temperature resistance, so that said flexible plastics pipe parts only allow a restricted conveyance of heating fluids. As flexible plastics pipe parts of said type are specially used for conveying heating fluids for heating houses and edifices, the latter fact is very disadvantageous.Above the aforementioned upper limit of the reticulating degree joining adjacent edge portions of a reticulated thermoplastics foam by heat welding will become impossible.The latter is, however, very desirable in order to surround the respective pipe part by the foam insulating layer as effectively as possible. The aforementioned reticulating degree limits are the more important as an improved closed cellular structure is thereby imparted to the plastics foam, which closed cellular structure improves the required insulation. The reticulated thermoplastics foam appropriately con snots of a reticulated polyolefin foam and, more par ticulorly, of a reticulated polyethylene foam. The weight by volume of the thermoplastics foam for the insulation of a flexible plastics pipe part and, more preferably, a polybutylene plastics pipe part, is pre 3 comprised between 35 kg m and 100 kg m 3 ferably comprised between 35 kg m and 100 kg m3. Reticulated foam plastics having a volume weight of less than 35 kg m3 are insufficiently rigid to optimally cen ter a flexible plastics pipe part with respect to the applied foam plastics layer and the tubular casing surrounding the same, the latter effectively consisting of polyethylene. A foam plastics having a weight by volume of 100 kg cm3 is on the other hand , too rigid, so that the assembly of a plastics pipe part, a foam plastics applied thereupon and a tubular casing is insufficiently flexible to surround the pipe part completely with the foam plastics layer. Advantageously a reticulated thermoplastics foam is used having a reticulating degree comprised between 30 and 50 and a volume density ranging preferably from 60 to 80 kg m3. The outer side of the insulating layer is very advan tageously surrounded by a tubular auxiliary layer, which auxiliary layer effectively consists of a perforated material, such as a knitted or a woven tube.Preferably a knitted tube of thermoplastics material is used as said tube can be effectively clamped around the applied foam plastics insulating layer.Very advantageously the material of the knitted tube consists of a polyamide material, as this material will provide very good results.When the aforementioned tubular auxiliary layer is used a polybutylene pipe comprising a foam plastics insulating layer and having not yet attained its form stabilized state, is passed into a flexible tubular casing of, for instance, polyethylene, more particularly a high density polyethylene, whereupon the assembly can be reeled up after crystallization.After transport of the pipe material in a reeled condition, the pipe material can be removed. from the reel and installed in a normal manner while applying any desired bend.The foam plastics layer applied around the flexible plas tics pipe part may consist of, for instance, a reticulated polyethylene foam band which is, for example, wound heli cally around the polybutylene pipe, so that the faces of the windings contacting each other can be interconnected by welding. However, it is also possible to fold a polyethylene foam band around the pipe and to weld together the edges of the band, which latter possibility is particularly preferred.The invention will be illustrated with reference to an embodiment thereof with the aid of the drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a pipe part according to the invention Fig. 2 is a cross section through a pipe part according to the invention Fig.. 3 is an installation for manufacturing a pipe part according to the present invention Fig. 4 shows a part of the finished composite pipe with projecting stocking. Fig. 1 shows a polybutylene pipe part 1, which thermoplas tics may be extruded in a normal manner as due to its properties, this material is very suitable for conveying heated liquids. Polybutylene is a strongly post crystclli zing plastic, thus causing such a polybutylene pipe to be extra sensitive to damages immediately after its extrusion. A plastics foam insulating layer consisting of a reticu lated polyethylene foam band 2 is applied upon the poly butylene pipe, said layer being formed by surrounding said polybutylene pipe by a band of reticulated polyethy lene foam, the lateral edges of same being welded to each other so that the polybutylene pipe is entirely surroun ded. The reticulated polyethylene foam band can obviously also be wound helically around the polybutylene pipe, the win dungs being interconnected by means of welding. The applied reticulated polyethylene foam layer consists of a polyethylene having a reticulating degree comprised between 10 and 70 , and preferably a reticulating degree comprised between 30 and 50 . Particularly advantageous is a reticulating degree of approximately 39. The applied reticulated polyethylene foam, has a volume density ranging from 35 to 100 kg m3, more preferably, ranging from 60 to 80 kg m3, while more particularly a polyethylene foam is used having a reticulating degree of approximately 39 and a volume density of about 70 kg m By using a reticulating degree which is not higher than the abovementioned values, the edges of the foam plastics may be interconnected by welding, which provides a particularly good insulation, as outside moisture will never be able to penetrate into the polybutylene pipe, which might happen, if the edges of the plastics foam band are not welded to each other.The outer side of the foam plastics insulating layer is provided with a knitted sleeve 3 of a nylon material, the assembly being surrounded by a tubular casing 4 of polyethylene.Said tubular casing 4 may obviously also consist of other plastics, provided the tubular casing, the plastics foam insulating layer 2 and the pipe part 1 remain flexible, so that the finished pipe part material may be installed in nearly any desired bend, the flexible plastics pipe part additionally being kept properly centered with respect to the tubular casing and the surrounding foam plastics layer of reticulated polyethylene.As after extrusion polybutylene pipes are extremely instable, due to thdrrubber like strvctvre it is recommen ded to manufacture the aforementioned pipe in a very particular manner.This proceeds as follows through an inlet 6 an extruder 5 is fed which extrudes a polybutylene pipe 1 through an extrusion nozzle 7. Subsequently said polybutylene pipe 1 is guided through a sizing device 8, a cooling device, and a drawing device in order to obtain the desired round shape and dimensions.The polybutylene pipe 1 obtained after the sizing operation still has a rubber like structure and has as yet to attain its form stability by crystallization. In order to prevent a damage of a polybutylene pipe of this type which is still apt to be easily damaged or deformed, a reticulated polyethylene foam band 2 from a storage reel 10 is immediately wound around scid polybutylene pipe 1, a welding element 11 connec ting the contacting edges of the reticulated polyethylene foam band 2,by welding. The still structurally instable pipe part comprising the foam plastics insulating layer is subsequently passed through a tubular chamber 12 having on its outer side a knitted nylon stocking 3. End 14 of the knitted nylon stocking 3 is firmly knotted whereupon the supplied polybutylene pipe 1 having on its outer side the previously applied plastics foaPminsu lating layer 2, entrains the knitted nylon stocking 3 from the point at which said stocking has been flushed upon the outer side of the chamber 12. The nylon stocking 3 is subsequently tightly drawn around the insulating layer. Finally the assembly consisting of the polybutylene pipe 1, the plastics foam insulating layer of reticulated poly ethylene 2 and the knitted nylon stocking 3 surrounding the latter, is guided into a tubular casing 4 of polyethylene material, more particularly a high density polyethylene material.After a certain length of said tubular casing 4 of polyethylene, for example a length of 200 m, has been filled with a composite pipe consisting of a polybutylene pipe 1, a polyethylene plastics foam insulating layer 2 and a nylon stocking 3, the knotted end 14 of the nylon stocking 3 is cut off and the pipe is stored.so as to enable the polybutylene to post crystallize in a normal manner and to attain its form stability, in order to be installed.Hereupon the composite pipe is reeled up.The use of a knitted nylon stocking 3 presents the advan tcae that parts of the foam plastics insulating layer 2 which may be insufficiently welded to each other, are properly retained, so that no problems will occur when the polybutylene pipe 1 wth the plastics foam insulating layer 2 is passed through the tubular casing 4.Said improperly welded parts of the plastics foam insulating layer 2 could easily be damaged by the front edge of the tubular casing 4 in the absence of a knitted nylon stocking 3.The presence of the tightly knotted end 14 of the nylon stocking 3 will obviously allow a tensional force to be exerted upon the assembly by the drawing member 15, so that the composite pipe part may easily be pcssed through the tubular casing 4 thus affording, together with other features, to maintain a high productive capacity. Exerting a tensional force upon the end 14 may also easily overcome the shearing forces between the polybutylene pipe with the plastics foam insulating layer and the inner side of the tubular casing 4. After post crystallization of the polybutylene pipe 1, the finished composite pipe part will comprise a polybutylene pipe 1 being disposed tensionless in the insulating layer of plastics foam, consisting of a reticulated polyethylene having a reticulating degree comprised between the aforementioned limits. It should be noted that the insulating layer will not be compressed in the finished composite pipe part in accordance with the invention. If, as a matter of fact, the insulating layer with the polybutylene pipe would be reeled up directly, said polybutylene pipe will crystallize into a non straight shape, so that subsequently bending said non strcight shape would cause the insulating layer to locally be compressed.
