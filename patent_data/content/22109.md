# A sewing machine for sewing fancy seams.

## Abstract
In a sewing machine with electronic pattern data circuits for the generation of signals used for sewing fancy seams it is possible to save spacing in the data memory by dividing the fancy seams into seam elements of several stitches so that every seam is composed of a plurality of seam elements and one and the same seam element is part of several fancy seams. A sewing machine utilizing the seam element principle must have two different memories, one stitch memory storing every element stitch by stitch and one seam instruction list storing for each fancy seam the sequence of seam elements forming the selected seam.
