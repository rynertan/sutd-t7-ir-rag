## Description
PROCESS FOR SCAVENGING FREE RESIDUAL MONOMER IN AQUEOUS MEDIA The present invention relates generally to a process for reducing the amount of residual acrylonitrile monomer dissolved in acrylonitrile containing polymers and aqueous media. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process wherein coagulation of acrylonitrile containing polymers dispersed in the aqueous media and scavenging of residual monomer may be accomplished by the same means. As is apparent from the ensuing description, the present invention is applicable to aqueous media from batch, semi batch and continuous polymerization processes. Acrylonitrile is employed in the preparation of a wide variety of commercially important resins, including nitrile rubbers, styrene acrylonitrile copolymer resins SAN , ABS graft copolymer thermoplastic molding resins, and numerous other acrylonitrile containing graft copolymer impact modifier resins. Acrylonitrile copolymers can be prepared in an aqueous system by batch, semi batch or continuous processes using conventional emulsion or suspension polymerization techniques. These techniques usually involve the formation of a latex or aqueous medium having acrylonitrile containing polymer, residual monomers, catalyst, by products and stabilizers dispersed therein. This latex must then be coagulated to form a slurry of polymer particles, and separation of the polymer particles from the water medium effectuated. However, even where the polymerization proceeds until it is substantially complete, an undesirable amount of unpolymerized acrylonitrile monomer usually remains both in the aqueous phase and in the polymer matrix. Because of environmental considerations, the presence of free acrylonitrile in the aqueous phase must be minimized where the monomer containing water will become part of the plant waste water effluent. Further, residual acrylonitrile monomer present in the copolymer may be detrimental to the color stability of the resin. Although residual free monomer may be removed by physical processes, such as by steam or vacuum stripping, these processes are relatively difficult to operate, and are relatively expensive and energy intensive. Further, when used by themselves these processes generally result in monomer removal which is incomplete.In addition, such methods do not prevent acrylonitrile monomer remaining in the waste stream from being lost to the atmosphere. It is in part. for these reasons that chemical monomer scavenging methods were developed. A variety of chemical methods for scavenging residual monomers from the polymer and the aqueous medium are known in the art. These methods usually involve adding to the aqueous medium a compound which is capable of forming an adduct with free acrylonitrile.Although free acrylonitrile is relatively volatile, acrylonitrile adducts are generally much less so.Consequently, formation of an acrylonitrilefscavenger adduct usually results in less acrylonitrile being vented to the atmosphere and more residual acrylonitrile being retained in the waste stream, where it may be degraded by biological means. Chemical methods are disclosed by U.S. Patent No.4,251,412 to Ferrini, which relates to a method for treating acrylonitrile latices to reduce the residual monomer content by adding an alkyl or alkanol amine, such as hydroxylamine acid sulfate and and hydrochloride, dimethylamine or diethanolamine, to the latex in an amount at least stoichiometrically equivalent to the amount of residual acrylonitrile monomer present. U.S.Patent No. 4,278,582 to Miller discloses a process for reducing the amount of residual acrylonitrile by treating the mixtures with ammonium or thio compounds or with a variety of inorganic salts. U.S. Patent 4,399,240 toSenyek teaches the use of 6 and 7 membered, saturated heterocyclic amines as acrylonitrile monomer scavengers.Other means of scavenging acrylonitrile monomers are disclosed by U.S. Patent Nos. 4,396,740 3,99S,797 4,221,878 4,180,486 4,275,175 4,196,111 4,215,024 4,221,905 4,228,119 4,365,027 Chemical Abstract 98 6 35808V and German Patent No. 148,223. A nonscavenger methods, involving post reaction of the acrylonitrile containing mixture with excess comonomer in the presence of additional catalyst, is disclosed by U.S.Patent 4,272,425. Although these processes may be effective, many require relatively large amounts of the scavenger compound in order to reduce the amount of free acrylonitrile monomer to an acceptable level. This may have the effect of increasing the level of non aqueous volatiles present in the aqueous phase, and may present further environmental problems as well as additional cost for waste water treatment. Further, many of these processes involve treatment of the polymer and or medium after coagulation. Not only does such a procedure entail the use of a separate coagulant system, but may result in less than optimal contact between the residual monomer present in the polymer and the scavenger compound.Consequently, a process wherein the amount of residual free acrylonitrile monomer in acrylonitrile containing polymers and concomitant aqueous media may be efficiently reduced using relatively minor amounts of a ciently reduced using relatively minor amounts of a scavenger compound offers significant advantages .over many processes known in the art. A process wherein minor amounts of scavenger may be used to at least partially coagulate an aqueous polymer dispersion, so that coagulation and monomer scavenging may be accomplished by the same means, offers even further advantages. The present invention is a process for reducing the free residual acrylonitrile monomer content of an aqueous medium containing the monomer, the process comprising adding to the medium a hydroxylamine in an amount less than the stoichiometric equivalent of the amount of free acrylonitrile monomer present in the medium. The hydroxylamine preferably is selected from the group consisting of N methyl hydroxylamine, N ethyl hydroxylamine and acid complexed hydroxylamine. In the most preferred embodiment the hydroxylamine is hydroxylamine complexed with a strong acid, such as HCl orH2SO4, and preferably is added to the medium in an amount sufficient to at least partially coagulate acrylonitrile containing polymer dispersed in the medium. The present invention is a processor reducing the free acrylonitrile content of an aqueous medium containing the monomer. This aqueous medium usually has acrylonitrile monomer, comonomers and acrylonitrile containing polymers dispersed therein. Depending on the stage in the resin production process at which the medium is treated, this medium may have the polymer dispersed therein as a suspension, emulsion or slurry. The aqueous dispersions of acrylonitrile polymers and residual monomer useful in the present invention are obtained by polymerizing acrylonitrile alone, or with other vinylidene comonomers to form copolymers. Examples of such copolymers are those with about 50 wt or more of butadiene, as in nitrile rubbers, up to about 50 wtZ acrylonitrile, and about 50 95 wt styrene as in SAN resins about 50 5 wt acrylonitrile with about 1 99 wt each of alkylacrylate, such as methylacrylate, ethylacrylate, butylacrylate, methylmethacrylate and the like, styrene and butadiene as in the well known ABS type terpolymer resins. Typically, polymerizable comonomers, in addition to butadiene, styrene and an alkylacrylate or alkacrylate wherein the alkyl group contains 1 to 8 carbon atoms, will be vinylidene monomers having at least one terminalCH2 C group. Polymerizable comonomers useful in the present invention include other vinyl aromatics, such as alpha methyl styrene and chloro styrene alpha olefins such ethylenes, propylenes and isobutylenes vinylhalides such as vinyl chloride, vinyl bromide, vinyl fluoride, vinylidene chloride, and vinylidene fluoride vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate other alpha,beta olefinically unsaturated nitriles, such as methacrylonitrile alkyl vinyl ethers such as methyl vinyl ether, isopropyl vinyl ether n butyl vinyl ether, isopropyl vinyl ether and haloalkyl vinyl ethers such as 2 chloroethyl vinyl ether n octyl methacrylate, dodecyl methacrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl ethacrylate haloalkyl acrylates such as chloropropyl acrylates aminoacrylates and methacrylates and the like vinyl ketones, vinyl pyridine, alpha,betaolefinically unsaturated amides such as acrylamide,N methyl acrylamide, N t butyl acrylamide, N cyclohexyl acrylamide, diacetone acrylamide, methacrylamide, andN ethyl methacrylamide alpha,beta olefinically unsaturated N alkylol amides such as N methylol acrylamide,N ethylol acrylamide, N propylol acrylamide, N methylol methacrylamide and N ethylol methacrylamide polyfunctional compounds such as methylene bis acrylamide, ethylene glycol dimethylacrylate, diethylene glycol diacrylate, allyl pentaerythritol and divinyl benzenes alpha,beta olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid monomers containing from 3 to 10 carbon atoms such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, betaacryloxypropionic acid, hydrosorbic acid, sorbic acid, alpha chlorosorbic acid, cinamic acid, beta styrylacrylic acid, itaconic acid, citratonic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, mesaconic acid, glutaconic acid, aconitric acid and the like. The preferred acid monomers are the alpha,beta monoolefinically unsaturated monocarboxylic acids, such as acrylic acid and methacrylic acid and the like as are known to those skilled in the art. Mixtures of one or more of the above men toned monomers may also be used. Generally, up to about 20 by weight of other polymerizable vinylidene comonomers may be employed. The polymer containing latex may be prepared using any of the conventional emulsion or suspension polymerization techniques, although the present invention is particularly applicable to latices prepared by emulsion polymerization. In an emulsion process, emulsifier may be charged at the outset of the polymerization, as in a batch or semi batch process, or may be added incrementally or by proportioning throughout the run, as in a continuous process. Any of the general types of anionic, cationic or nonionic emulsifiers may be employed, however, best results are generally obtained when anionic emulsifiers are used. Typical emulsifiers which may be used include those types known to those skilled in the art, for example, as disclosed beginning on page 102 in J. Van Alphen s Rubber Chemicals , Elsevier, 1956, for example, the alkali metal or ammonium salts of the sulfates of alcohols containing from 8 to 18 carbon atoms such as, for example, sodium lauryl sulfate alkali metal and ammonium salts of sulfonated petroleum or paraffin oils sodium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids such as dodecane 1 sulfonic acid and octadiene 1 sulfonic acid alkyl aryl sulfonates such as sodium isopropyl benzene sulfonate and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate alkali metal and ammonium salts of sulfonated dicarboxylic acid esters such as sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate and disodium N octadecyl sulfosuccinamate alkali metal or ammonium salts of the free acids of complex organic mono and diphosphate esters and the like. So called nonionic emulsifiers are octyl or nonylphenyl polyethoxyethanol and the like. Useful as emulsifiers are the alkali metal salts of the aromatic sulfonic acids and the sodium salts of the aromatic sulfonic acids and the sodium salts of the alkyl aryl sulfonates. In addition to the above mentioned emulsifiers it may be desirable and advantageous to add postpolymerization emulsifiers and stabilizers to the poly merits an ionic latex binders in order to improve the latex stability if it is to be stored for prolonged periods prior to use. Such post polymerization emulsifiers may be the same as, or different than, the emulsifiers employed in conducing the pol ymerization but preferably a re anionic or nonionic surface active agents. To initiate the polymerization free radical catalysts are employed. The use of such catalysts, although in certain systems not absolutely essential, ensures a more uniform and controllable polymerization and a satisfactory polymerization rate. Commonly used free radical initiators include the various peroxygen compounds such as the persulfates, benzoyl peroxide, t butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide azo compounds such as azodiisobutyronitrile, and dimethyl azodiisobutyrate and the like. Especially useful as polymerization initiators are the water soluble peroxygen compounds such as hydrogen peroxide and the sodium, potassium and ammonium persulfates. The alkali metal and ammonium persulfate catalysts may be employed by themselves or in activated redox systems. Typical redox systems include the persulfates in combination with a reducing substance, such as a polyhydroxy phenol, and an oxidizable sulfur compound such as sodium sulfite or sodium bisulfite, a reduding sugar, a diazomercapto compound, a ferricyanide compound, dimethylaminopropionitrile and the like. Heavy metal ions such as silver, cupric, iron, cobalt, nickel and others may also be used to activate persulfate catalyzed polymerizations. In general the amount of free radical initiator employed will range between about 0.1 to 5 based on the weight of the total monomers. In a batch or semi batch process the initiator is generally completely charged at the start of the polymerization, however, incremental addition or proportioning of the initiator throughout the polymerization is often desirable. In a continuous process the initiator is, of course, introduced to the reactor by incremental or continuous addition. In conducting the polymerization for the preparation of acrylonitrile containing latices the monomers are typically charged into the polymerization reactor, which contains the water and, when appropriate, the emulsifying agent. The reactor and its contents are heated and the polymerization initiator added. In batch or semi batch processes these steps generally occur sequentially. In continuous processes, however, introduction of monomers, water, emulsifying agent, initiator, and heating of the mixture generally occur on an ongoing basis. The temperature at which the polymerization is conducted is not critical and may range from about oec and 80 C or higher. Excellent results, however, have been obtained when the polymerization temperature is maintained between 5 C and 70 C. Polymerization modifiers such as the primary, secondary and tertiary mercaptans, buffers, electrolytes and the like may also be included in the polymerization medium. After polymerization the polymer dispersed within the latex is coagulated. The resulting coagulum is separated from the resulting slurry by filtering, centrifugation, evaporation of volatiles, or other known techniques. In processes of the prior art, coagulation is usually accomplished by addition of coagulants to the polymer dispersion. Such coagulants may include an aliphatic alcohol such as isopropyl alcohol, acids such as sulfuric, brines and salts such as KA1 SO4 2 .12H2O, CaC1 6H2O, NH4Al S04 2.12H2O, A12 SO4 3, and other materials. The dispersion undergoing coagulation often is also heated during and or after this step to en co urage Ihe coagu lum to coalesce to form particles of the desired size. In the process of the present invention, a hydroxylamine is added to the aqueous medium. Although this addition of hydroxylamine may take place after coagulation of the polymer, hydroxylamine preferably is added to the aqueous medium before or during the coagulation step. The hydroxylamine useful in the process of the invention has an active hydrogen bonded to the nitrogen, and preferably is one described by the general formulaRHNOH wherein R is hydrogen or a C1 to C3 alkyl moiety.Hydrogen, methyl and ethyl moieties, such as in hydroxyl amine, N methyl hydroxylamine and N ethyl hydroxylamine, are more preferred. Hydroxylamine, e.g. WH2OH, is most preferred. However, as free hydroxylamine tends to be unstable and may be difficult or dangerous to handle, nt is preferred that hydroxylamine be complexed with an acid to facilitate its handling. This complexing of the hydroxylamine with acid has the further advantages of aiding in the breaking of emulsions, and of rendering the hydroxylamine more soluble in the aqueous medium.This acid preferably is a strong inorganic acid, such asHCl and H2SO4, and forms complexes with hydroxylamine such as hydroxylamine hydrochloride NH2OH. HCl , hydroxylamine acid sulfate NH2OH.H2SO4 and hydroxylamine sulfate NH2OH 2.H2SO4 . Hydroxylamine hydrochloride and hydroxylamine sulfate are more preferred. Although hydroxylamine hydrochloride is most preferred for color sensitive polymers, where color is not important hydroxylamine sulfate may be most preferred for operational consider actions and cost. It is critical to the present invention that less than the stoichiometric equivalent of the. amount of amine, based on the amount of free acrylonitrile monomer present in the dispersion, be introduced to the aqueous medium. Stoichiometric ratios of the hydroxylamine to acrylonit rile monomer equal to or less than 1 1.5 are.preferred, such as where one mole of hydroxylamine h drochloride or one half mole of hydroxylamine sulfate is added for every 1.5 moles of free acrylonitrile monomer. Stoichiometric ratios of equal to or less than 1 2 are more preferred, and may be 1 2.5, 1 4, 1 7 or even less consistent with the present invention. The hydroxylamine may be added to the dispersion after the polymer has been coagulated by conventional means to form a slurry. However, in the preferred embodiment, acid complexed hydroxylamine is added to an aqueous polymer emulsion before coagulation, in an amount less than the stoichiometric equivalent of the free acrylonitrile present, yet which is sufficient to at least partially coagulate the polymer dispersed in the aqueous medium. The minimum amount of hydroxylamine required for coagulation to occur may vary depending on the amount of polymer present, the amount of free residual monomer present and the temperature of the medium.However, in most processes this amount should be at least 0.65 parts by weight of hydroxylamine per 100 parts by weight of polymer in the aqueous medium. More preferably at least 1 part of hydroxylamine should be added per 100 parts of polymer present in the medium. Consistent with the invention, the hydroxylamine may be used alone to coagulate the polymer, or may be supplemented by other known coagulants. Supplemental chemical coagulants may be added to the dispersion either before, at the same time as, or after addition of hydroxylamine. However, supplemental coagulants usually should be used in relatively minor amounts, such as less than 50 by weight of the amount of hydroxylamine employed. In the most preferred embodiment, however, the chemical coagulant consists essentially of hydroxylamine. The dispersion preferably also is heated as part of the coagulation step, such as by the introduction of steam in standard latex dewatering procedures. This heating may minimize the quantity of amine required to achieve satisfactory coagulation of the polymer. Heating may occur simultaneous with the introduction of the hydroxylamine to the dispersion, such as may typically occur in continuous processes, or may occur after addition of the hydroxylamine, when coagulation has at least partially already taken place, or both.Although the preferred temperature will vary depending, at least in part, on the temperature at which resin begins to degrade, the temperature at which the resin softens sufficiently to coalesce, and the particle size of coag ulum desired, temperatures of about 80 C to about 1000C usually are appropriate. The process of the present invention is also applicable to effluent streams from plants using acrylonitrile, wherein the effluent streams contain dissolved free acrylonitrile monomer in trace or even larger amounts. By treating such water effluents in accordance with thisInvention, the undesirable acrylonitrile monomer is converted so as not to be a problem in plant effluence. A further application would be the use of hydroxylamines as gas scrubbers where gaseous effluents from reactors and the like may contain undesirable acrylonitrile monomer tat might be vented to the atmosphere. ln addition the above description, theprcess.. of the present invention may be understood by reference to o the illustrative non limiting examples provided below. Examples 1 and 2 below describe various embodiments o the present invention. Comparative Examples C3 C6 do not embody the invention, but provide a basis for compar lng the relative effectiveness of the process of the present invention. Unless noted otherwise, each of Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Examples C3 C6 utilized the apparatus and procedures outlined below. Each coagulation was performed using the same equipment, , including the same stainless steel beaker, thermometer, electrically driven agitator, and sparging orifice. A 500 mL sample of ABS latex was used for each of the examples through Comparative Example C6. One mL aliquot of the sample was taken to determine residual free acrylonitrile monomer ACN content by gas chromatography GC , and the results reported under initial in the table below. The remaining 499 mL of the sample was added with stirring at a temperature of 820C 180 F , to 500 mL of aqeuous solution containing the amount of coagulant indicated in each example.Immediately thereafter, a 10 mL aliquot of the suspension or, where coagulation occurred, the resultant slurry was removed and submitted for GC analysis for free acrylonitrile monomer ACN , and the results reported under slurry in the table below. Using steam sparging, the remaining sample was heated to 91 C 195F and held at this temperature for five minutes. Thereafter, the sample was cooled to 710C 160 F by stirring the contents at constant rpm while simultaneously cascading a rapid stream of very cold running water over the outer sides of the beaker. The sample was filtered with gentle vacuum through a Buchner funnel lined with a fine mesh nylon filter cloth.A portion of the wet filtrate was analyzed for residual ACN , and the results reported under filtrate in the table below. The remaining wet filtrate retained in the funnel was collected without washing and was dried in an oven maintained at a temperature below 54µC 130 F for 24 hrs. All samples were dried in the same oven, and tested for residual ACN. The residual ACN content of the samples treated according to the process of the present invention was commensurate with that of samples treated by the control process. The results of the analysis for these examples are indicated in Table I. Unless noted otherwise, the amount of ACN is indicated in parts per million ppm of the dry latex. The amount of the coagulant is indicated in parts by weight per one hundred parts by weight ofABS latex denoted fpph Coax . The molar ratio of coagulant to residual ACN is listed in the tables under Moles Coag Moles ACN . In addition to the examples indicated below inTable I, sodium oxalate was also tested at 5.0 pph, but failed to coagulate the latex. The data in Table I indicate that a significant reduction of free residual acrylonitrile monomer may be obtained by the process of the present invention.Although not wishing to be bound by theory, the data for these and the following Examples and Comparative Examples suggest that the free acrylonitrile monomer does not volatilize out of the aqueous medium to a significant extent, but instead forms a nonvolatile adduct with the hydroxylamine, which retains the monomer in the aqueous medium. Testing of the dry resin product also indicated the process of the invention to be effective in reducing the content of residual styrene monomer, alpha methylstyrene monomer, and catalyst in relation to the residual amounts of these components in resins produced by the comparative processes.

These examples were performed according to the procedure described above, except that the initial volume of both the latex and the coagulating solution was increased to 1000 mL each, and a 10 mL aliquot was removed both before and after the latex was combined with the coagulant. The effect of these processes on residual ACN is indicated below in Table II. An increase in the amount of ACN in the filtrate over that in the slurry observed in some examples may have been due to inadequate mixing of the sample before the aliquot was taken. The ACN content of the dried resin of the Examples and theComparative Examples was approximately the same.
