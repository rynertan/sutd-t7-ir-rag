# A liquid chromatography column, process for preparing the same and its use for fractionation.

## Abstract
A liquid chromatography column comprising a uniform gel bed of a high packing ratio, which is produced by a process in which a column is prepared while avoiding imposing an abrupt change of flow rate or pressure on the gel bed during the column packing operation, thereby making it possible to simultaneously improve the elution speed and the durability of the column. The column compris es gels of small grain diameter, thereby exhibiting an excellent resolution. The column also ensures a direct analysis of blood serum.
