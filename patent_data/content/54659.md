# Method for forming dielectric isolation regions in a monocrystalline silicon substrate.

## Abstract
Dielectric isolation regions are formed in a monocrys talline silicon substrate 10 through forming trenches 20 in the substrate 10 by reactive ion etching after having etched openings in a layered structure 14, 15 of silicon dioxide and silicon nitride on the surface of the substrate 10 . The substantially vertical side walls 21 of the trenches 20 in the substrate 10 are oxidized prior to depositing polycrystalline silicon on the side walls as a whole. By selective doping of the portion 27 of the polycrystalline silicon on the side walls of the openings in the layered structure 14, 15 , the polycrystalline silicon on the side walls of the openings in the layered structure 14, 15 will oxidize at least twice as fast as the polycrystalline silicon 26 on the side walls 21 in the substrate 10 . Thermal oxidation causes the polycrystalline silicon to close the upper end of each of the trenches 20 while leaving an air space 29 therebeneath to form the dielectric isolation regions.
