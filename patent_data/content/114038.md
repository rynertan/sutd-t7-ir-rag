# Method for removing and recovering nutrients from wastewater.

## Abstract
A method for removing and recovering ammonium and or potassium and or phosphate ions from wastewater is pre sented which comprises permitting said wastewater to pass through at least one bed of ion exchange resins capable of removing selectively those nutrient ions regenerating those ion exchange resins with a Na Cl so lution or other suitable regenerant solution so that said nu trient ions may be obtained in a much more concentrated form adding to said regeneration eluates or, eventually, di rectly to wastewater at least one Mg salt, in proper pH condi tions so as to precipitate hydrous MgNH₄PO₄ and or MgKPO₄, slightly soluble salts of great agronomic value.
