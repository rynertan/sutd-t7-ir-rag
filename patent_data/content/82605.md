# APPARATUS FOR SEAL TESTING SACHETS, PACKETS AND THE LIKE

## Abstract
A sachet S is received for testing at a receiving station 10 by one of a plurality of carrier devices 17 mounted on an indexable rotor 16, and is carried thereby to a delivery station 14. As the sachet S is being thus carried, it is compressed between a fixed member 22 and a movable member 23. In the event that the sealing of the sachet S is defective, the member 23 will have moved more than a predetermined amount towards the member 22 by the time the carrier device 17 has reached a detection station 12, and this is detected by an optical detector 36 at the station 12. In response to such detection, a rejection device 37 moves the member 23 away from the member 22 and thereby releases the defective sachet from the respective carrier device 17.
