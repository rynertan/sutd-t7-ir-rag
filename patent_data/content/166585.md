# NOVEL PEPTIDE AND GENE CODING FOR SAME

## Abstract
A DNA fragment including a base sequence coding for a peptide occurring in rat atrium cordis and having diuretic action or a precursor of the peptide, plasmids containing the DNA fragment, microorganisms transformed with the plasmid, and a process for production of the peptide using the transformant. A new peptide consisting of 126 amino acids occuring in rat atrium cordis and a precursor thereof. The peptide has nota ble diuretic action and hypotensive or antihypertensive ac tions.
