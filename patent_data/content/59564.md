## Description
This invention relates to the manufacture of glass preforms, from which optical fibre waveguides can be produced by drawing, by a method of the type hereinafter referred to as the type specified in which a chemical reaction is caused to take place between oxygen and the vapour or vapours of one or more compounds such as halides, which reaction results in the formation of a coating composed essentially of one or more oxides on a glass substrate surface the substrate surface on which the coating is formed may be the interior surface of a glass tube or the exterior surface of a glass core. The invention also relates to apparatus for use in carrying out the method described. Methods which have been proposed for promoting a said chemical reaction include the application of heat, and the production of a plasma in the gaseous mixture.Thus for effecting deposition of a coating on the interior surface of a substrate tube, a heat source may be traversed along the exterior of the tube while the gaseous mixture flows through the tube, the solid reaction product being formed as fine particles which are deposited progressively along the surface of the tube bore and converted into a glass layer by further heating, and the process being repeated as required to form a multi layer coating. Progressive deposition along the bore of a tube can also be effected by causing relative longitudinal movement to take place between the tube and a plasmaexciting device external to the tube.In another method which has been proposed for effecting plasma activation of a said reaction in a gaseous mixture flowing through a substrate tube, the plasma exciting device is maintained in a stationary position around a portion of the tube adjacent to the gas exit end thereof, and the electrical power input to the device is continuously and progressively varied to cause the termination of the plasma column to be swept along the tube, the column being alternately extended and contracted, and each sweep of the plasma column again resulting in progressive deposition along the tube. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method of the type specified for manufacturing an optical fibre preform, by the deposition of a coating as aforesaid either on the interior surface of a substrate tube or on the exterior surface of a substrate core. According to the invention, in a method of manufacturing a glass optical fibre preform in which a coating composed essentially of one or more oxides is formed on a surface of an elongate cylindrical substrate by causing a chemical reaction to take place between oxygen and the vapour or vapours of one or more compounds capable of reacting with oxygen to produce the desired coating material, a tube which has a multiplicity of perforations through its wall is supported coaxially with the substrate, an annular space being provided between the said tube and the substrate, and a gaseous mixture consisting of oxygen and said vapour or vapours, and optionally an additional carrier gas, is caused to flow into the said annular space, at least the said vapour or vapours being introduced into the annular space by being passed through the perforations in said tube, a sufficient gas pressure differential being maintained between the interior and exterior of said tube to cause gas to flow through the perforations into said annular space, while at least a major part of the length of the substrate is maintained at an elevated temperature, and a chemical reaction is caused to take place throughout the annular space by generating energy in said space, whereby a coating of solid material resulting from the said reaction is formed simultaneously on the whole of the said surface of the heated length of the substrate, while residual gases and gaseous reaction products are withdrawn from said annular space. In a first form of the invention, the substrate consists of a glass tube, an inner tube which has a multiplicity of perforations through its wall is supported coaxially within the substrate tube, and the said gaseous reaction mixture, or at least the said vapour or vapours, is or are introduced into the annular space between the inner perforated tube and the substrate tube by being passed into the inner tube so as to emerge through said perforations into the said space, the gas pressure within the inner tube being maintained higher than that in the said space, while heat is applied to the exterior of at least a major part of the length of the substrate tube, and a chemical reaction is caused to take place throughout the said space by generating energy in said space, whereby a coating of solid material resulting from the said reaction is formed simultaneously on the whole of the interior surface of the heated length of the substrate tube. The substrate tube is usually of circular crosssection, in accordance with the normal practice in the manufacture of optical fibre preforms. The inner, perforated tube is also usually of circular cross section. A pressure differential must be maintained between the interior of the inner tube and the said annular space in which the reaction takes place, in order to ensure that the vapour or vapours with or without oxygen and or additional carrier gas introduced into the inner tube will flow through the perforations into the said space. Preferably one end of the inner tube is closed or has a restricted outlet to enable the required pressure differential to be maintained, and to ensure that the reactant vapours leave the inner tube only through the perforations. Alternatively, it is possible to introduce the gas vapours simultaneously into both ends of the inner tube to sustain the required pressure.The reduced pressure in the annular space is maintained by constant exhaustion of this space by suitable pumping means connected to one end of the substrate tube, through which gaseous reaction products, carrier gas and any residual gaseous reactants are removed. The pressure in the inner tube must be limited so that the flow rate of the gases into the annular reaction space is not so rapid that the required reduced pressure in said space cannot be maintained by the pumping system.If desired, the substrate tube may be exhausted from both ends, especially if gases are introduced into both ends of the inner tube. In a second form of the invention, the substrate consists of an elongate seed core and is supported coaxially within a tube which has a multiplicity of perforations through its wall, the perforated tube is surrounded by a coaxial outer tube, an annular duct being provided between the inner perforated tube and the outer tube, and the said gaseous reaction mixture is passed into said duct under sufficient pressure to cause passage thereof through the perforations of the inner tube into the annular space between the inner tube and the seed core, while the seed core is maintained at an elevated temperature and a chemical reaction is caused to take place throughout the said space by generating energy in said space, whereby a coating of solid material resulting from the said reaction is formed simultaneously on the whole of the exterior surface of the seed core. The seed core may be a rod or tube, and is usually of circular cross section, but may be of any other desired cross sectional configuration, for example elliptical, hexagonal, square or reactangular. The seed is usually formed of glass, but may be a rod or tube of non vitreous material, for example carbon or ceramic material, which can be subsequently removed from the coating. The seed may, if desired, consist of a silica based optical fibre core preform of either constant or radially graded refractive index, the coating formed thereon constituting a cladding and or barrier layer. If a tubular seed core is employed, it may be sealed at one end, or may be open at both ends to permit heating or cooling by passing hot or cold gas through the tube, if required for improving the form of the deposit or the preform characteristics. If the seed core is in the form of a tube, after completion of the coating process, and vitrification of the coating if necessary, the tube bore is collapsed in known manner. The inner, perforated tube and the outer tube are usually of circular cross section The annular duct between the inner and outer tubes constitutes a pressure equalising reservoir of the gaseous mixture fed through the perforations of the inner tube into the space surrounding the seed core in which the coating forming reaction takes place. If desired, the gas pressure in the annular reaction space may be modified in a radial or longitudinal direction by means of pressure or exhaust control tubes with perforations in their walls, located in the said space, or a perforated outer tube may be used as an extraction and pressure control device. The reservoir duct between the inner and outer tubes may be subdivided in a linear or spiral manner to provide a gas input duct and an exhaust duct, each duct having perforations of different size or distribution alternatively, such an arrangement may be employed for the input of different constituents of the gaseous mixture. In either form of the invention, the application of heat is required for maintaining the substrate tube or seed core at a suitable elevated temperature for promoting smooth, uniform deposition, and may also provide at least part of the energy required for promoting the gaseous reaction. In the first form of the invention, the heating is conveniently effected by enclosing the substrate tube in a tubular electric furnace. In the second form of the invention a similar external heating arrangement can be used where the seed core is in the form of a rod. However, the use of a tubular seed core is particularly advantageous since heating means, such as a heating element or an electrode, can be inserted within the tube. Such internal heating is the preferred method of maintaining the seed substrate at the required elevated temperature. The outer regions of the system, that is to say the perforated tube surrounding the seed, the outer tube, and the reservoir duct between these tubes, are maintained at a temperature considerably lower than that of the seed, to ensure that the coating forming reaction takes place substantially only in the vicinity of the seed, and hence that substantially all of the solid reaction product is deposited on the seed, little or no deposition occurring on the perforated tube. The method of the invention is particularly applicable to the manufacture of an optical fibre preform composed of silica with one or more dopants for imparting a desired refractive index profile to the fibre. In this case, the substrate tube or seed core is formed of vitreous silica, and the reactant vapours suitably consist of silicon tetrachloride and, for at least part of the process, a halide or halides from which the required dopant or dopants is or are derived. The halide vapours are entrained in streams of carrier gas which are bubbled through the liquid halides oxygen may be employed as the carrier gas, or an additional gas, suitably argon, may be used for this purpose.The halides employed are usually chlorides, but if it is desired to introduce fluorine as a dopant in the silica coating a suitable fluorine containing compound, such as dichlero difluorosilane, may be included in the reaction mixture. In the first form of the invention, the substrate tube may form the cladding of an optical fibre the core of which is formed of the coating material, or the tube may constitute a support for an optical waveguide structure wholly formed by the coating material. The composition of the gas vapour mixture introduced into the inner tube may be maintained constant throughout the deposition process, to produce a step refractive index structure, or may be varied as desired to produce a coating of graded refractive index, or a coating composed of two or more concentric regions with and without dopants, which regions may constitute, for example, cladding and or barrier layers and the core of the fibre obtained from the preform, each such region being of either uniform or graded composition as required. In the second form of the invention the coating deposited on the seed may constitute only the core of the optical fibre, the coated seed being subsequently inserted into a cladding or support tube and the assembly then consolidated by heating, before drawing. If desired, however, the dopant halides may be eliminated and or varied for the later stages of the process, so that a cladding and or barrier layer is formed around the core again, each region of the deposit may be of either constant or graded composition. The method of the invention constitutes an essentially continuous process for building up a coating on the surface of an elongate substrate, the whole of the required length of the substrate being coated at the same time. Thus the operations of causing the flow of gases and vapours through the system, generating energy in the annular reaction zone, and applying heat, can be carried out continuously for any length of time required to produce a coating of a desired thickness. However, the process may be interrupted when desired, provided that on recommencement the continuity of the composition of the coating, whether uniform, graded, or stepped, is maintained by appropriate control of the composition of the gaseous reaction mixture and of the operating conditions. In either form of the invention, the dimensions of the spaces both inside and outside the perforated tube, and the arrangement of the perforations in said tube, should be such that the coating deposited on the substrate is of uniform thickness both radially and longitudinally. The perforations may be varied in respect of number, diameter and distribution along the length of the tube as required to produce desired gas flow and deposition rates. In particular, in the first form of the invention, it may be necessary to provide an increasing number of perforations towards the end of the inner tube remote from the gas input end thereof, to counteract the effect of a drop in pressure along the tube. It may also be desirable to rotate and or reciprocate the perforated tube with respect to the substrate tube or seed, to ensure radial and longitudinal uniformity of deposition of the coating. The perforated tube is preferably formed of vitreous silica, through which perforations of the required sizes and distribution can be drilled alternatively, the tube may be formed of a porous ceramic material with suitably distributed and sized pores constituting the required perforations. If desired, some or all of the constituents of the gaseous mixture may be introduced through individual perforated tubes inserted into the main tube system, either inside or outside the aforesaid perforated tube. Such an arrangement may be advantageous when it is required to vary the rates of flow of the halide vapours in relation to one another1 in the manufacture of a graded index fibre. The energy generated in the annular space between the substrate and the perforated tube, for activating the coating forming reaction, may be of a non isothermal type, produced for example by a plasma or a laser beam, or may be isothermal energy produced by the heating of the substrate either externally or, in the case of a tubular seed core, internally, as mentioned above, or by gas combustion taking place in the said space. If a non isothermal energy source is employed, the energy produced may be enhanced by the heat applied to the system. A preferred energy source is a plasma exciting device, operated in such a manner as to produce a plasma column in the gaseous mixture in the annular reaction zone between the substrate and the perforated tube, and to maintain the column throughout substantially the whole length of the said space. Preferably the device is maintained in a stationary position with respect to the assembly of substrate and perforated tube, but if desired it may be reciprocated longitudinally with respect to the said assembly. The device may be Åa RF coil surrounding a substrate tube, or surrounding the tube system around a seed core.Alternatively, and preferably, the device may be a microwave cavity located around one end of the substrate tube, or of the outer tube around a seed core, and supplied with sufficient power to produce a plasma column of the required length. It is usually necessary to employ auxiliary means, such as a Tesla coil, to initiate the plasma. The maintenance of a pressure differential, as aforesaid, such that the gas pressure within the inner perforated tube in the first form of the invention, or within the outer reservoir duct in the second form of the invention, is greater than that in the annular space between the perforated tube and the substrate in each case, is necessary not only for ensuring continuous gas flow into the said space, but also to ensure that a plasma is produced only in the said space. Thus the pressure in the inner tube or outer duct respectively, which is controlled in the gas vapour input line to said tube or duct, is kept sufficiently high to prevent plasma formation within said tube or duct, while the pressure in the said annular space is maintained sufficiently low to ensure that a plasma column of appropriate length is sustained in this space. The conditions of temperature and gas flow, as well as pressure differential, are so controlled that reaction between the oxygen and reactant vapour or vapours takes place only in the annular space between the perforated tube and the substrate, the occurrence of any reaction within the perforated tube in the first form of the invention, or outside the perforated tube in the second form of the invention, being prevented.In the first form of the invention, preferably only the reactant vapours, entrained in a carrier gas, for example argon, are passed into the inner perforated tube, the oxygen, with or without additional carrier gas, being passed through the space between the inner and substrate tubes, so that the said reaction can take place only on mixing of the reactant vapours with oxygen in the said space. If desired, however, the oxygen can be passed into the inner tube, and may constitute the carrier gas for the vapours in this case the heat applied to the substrate tube must be so controlled that the temperature of the inner tube is maintained too low to cause thermally activated reaction to occur therein. When a plasma is employed for activating the reaction, the oxygen present in the annular space can provide sufficient ionisable gas to sustain the plasma, but if desired an additional ionisable gas, suitably argon, krypton or xenon, may also be passed through the annular space, whether or not such a gas is used as the carrier for the reactant vapours. The provision of such additional ionisable gas assists in sustaining the plasma as well as increasing the total carrier gas flow through the system. A relatively high rate of flow of carrier gas in relation to the rates of flow of oxygen and reactant vapours is advantageous since the higher the ratio of carrier gas flow rate to oxygen and reactant vapour flow rates, the greater is the length of plasma column attainable with a given level of power input to the plasma exciting device.The ratio of the flow rates of oxygen to reactant vapour or vapours should, of course, be sufficiently high to ensure substantially complete conversion of the reactant compounds to the oxides we have found, in practice, that a proportion of oxygen considerably in excess of the stoichiometric proportion is required for complete conversion. It is usually preferred to control the conditions of temperature of the substrate tube or seed core, gas pressure in the said annular space, and relative rates of flow of the gaseous constituents into the said space, so that a vitreous reaction product is formed directly on the substrate, without preliminary formation of particulate material either on the substrate or in the gaseous reaction mixture in the said space.With plasma excitation, for example using a power supply not substantially greater than 300 watts, the gas pressure in the said space occupied by the plasma is preferably maintained below 100 Torr, and if it is desired to form a vitreous coating directly the pressure is preferably maintained below 20 Torr. However in some cases operation at higher power and higher pressure, with the formation of a particulate coating, may be desirable, since higher deposition rates are attainable under such conditions.The substrate is preferably maintained at a sufficiently high temperature to ensure the production of a smooth, continuous vitreous coating without causing distortion of the substrate, a suitable temperature in the case of a silica substrate being about 10000C, If a particulate coating is formed initially it is vitrified by the applied heat which in these circumstances may be required to raise the temperature of the substrate above 1000 Cjfor example to 1200 12500C, Some deposition of the coating material may occur on the outer surface of the perforated tube in the first form of the invention, or on the inner surface of the said tube in the second form of the invention, but to a lesser extent than on the substrate, provided that the substrate is maintained at a suitably high temperature, and we have found that little or no deposition occurs in the perforations, so that these do not become blocked. One suitable form of plasma exciting device for use in carrying out the method of the invention is a microwave cavity of the asymmetrical type, formed of two concentric cylinders, the inner cylinder being located around a portion of the tube which contains the plasma in operation, that is to say the substrate tube in the first form of the invention, or the perforated tube in the second form of the invention, in each case adjacent to one end of the tube.The inner cylinder is shorter than the outer cylinder, and the cavity is so designed that, in operation, a region of high electrical field strength is produced only at the inner end of the inner cylinder that is to say the end of the inner cylinder remote from the adjacent end of the tube surrounded by the cylinder , so that the plasma column produced extends wholly along the space in which reaction is required to take place, and not in the reverse direction. The power input to the microwave cavity, from a microwave generator, is maintained at an approximately constant level throughout the coating process, and may be of any desired magnitude for producing a plasma column of the length required to effect deposition of the coating on a given longitudinal region of the substrate. Furthermore, the power level required will also depend upon the gas pressure in the space between the perforated tube and the substrate, and upon the relative rates of flow of the constituents of the gaseous mixture through the system, since these factors, as indicated above, affect the length of plasma column obtained with a given power input. Preferably, in addition to a microwave cavity as aforesaid, an electrically conductive tube is positioned coaxially around the tube system, abutting the microwave cavity and extending along the tube system for a distance corresponding to the desired length of the plasma column, the arrangement being such that the combination of the conductive tube and the plasma column produced in operation constitutes a coaxial waveguide this conductive tube may be constituted by the inner wall of a tubular furnace employed for external heating of the system, or may be a separate metal tube.In operation of this arrangement of microwave cavity and conductive tube hereinafter referred to as a waveguide tube11 , power from the cavity is coupled to the plasma, and a progressive electromagnetic wave is launched along the wave guide from the cavity, promoting increased extension of the plasma column for a given power input to the cavity. The dimensions of the microwave cavity are preferably such that the cavity will support an electromagnetic wave in the transverse electromagnetic TEM mode, and the length of the inner cylinder of the cavity is preferably adjusted so that the power reflected at, the inner end of the inner cylinder sets up a standing wave pattern within the cavity, with the maximum voltage at the level of the inner end of the inner cylinder. Such a standing wave pattern is approximately equal to 2n 1 where n is an integer andXis the free 4 space wavelength of the operating frequency applied to the cavity. Advantageously, for carrying out the method of the first form of the invention, the waveguide tube has an internal diameter which is such, it relation to the internal diameter of the substrate tube corresponding to the outer diameter of the plasma column , that tbe wave propagated along the waveguide is in the H10 coaxial mode we have found that propagation in the H10 mode results in the production of a plasma column of maximum length, with any given conditions of power input and gas fl9w rates and pressure, thus giving optimum effeciency in respect of the use of power, and that propagation in this mode depends upon the relationship between the internal diameters of the substrate tube and the waveguide tube respectively.Thus, for a given substrate tube internal diameter, there is a critical minimum internal diameter of the waveguide tube which must be equalled or exceeded in order to obtain propagation in the Hlo mode along the waveguide, and hence to obtain the optimum length of plasma column. The minimum wave guide tube internal diameter required, to ensure propagation in the H10 mode, is close to that derived from the following relationship ir x y where is the free space wavelength of the operating frequency, x is the internal radius of the substrate tube, and y is the internal radius of the waveguide tube. Similar considerations apply in carrying out the method of the second form of the invention, using a microwave cavity and waveguide tuber. thus propagation of a wave in the H10 mode along the wave guide is dependent upon the relationship between the internal diameters of the wave guide tube and the perforated tube respectively, in a similar manner to the dependency on the internal diameters of the substrate tube and the waveguide tube in the first form of the invention. For ensuring optimum operation of the microwave cavity coaxial waveguide arrangement, the total impedance of this arrangement should match that of the combination of the microwave generator and the cable connecting the generator to the cavity. The impedance of the cavity waveguide system is affected by the internal diameter of the waveguide tube, and can be conveniently adjusted to the optimum value by altering the ratio of the diameters of the inner and outer cylinders of the cavity. As an alternative form of energy source, which can be used instead of a plasma exciting device, a laser may be located adjacent to one end of the substrate tube in the first form of the invention, or of the perforated tube in the second form of the invention, and operated in such a manner that a laser beam is directed along and within the annular space between the perforated tube and the substrate, so as to surround the perforated tube or the seed core respectively. A further method of generating the energy require for promoting the coating forming reaction, which may be employed in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, another form of energy excitation such as the production of a plasma, consists in including a combustible gas in the gaseous reaction mixture, and effecting combustion of this gas in the annular space between the substrate and the perforated tube. If the substrate is heated externally or internally in the case of a tubular seed core , for example to 10000C1 before the combustible gas is introduced, spontaneous ignition will take place in a gaseous mixture containing appropriate relative proportions of oxygen and combustible gas.Alternatively, the additional heating may be omitted, and ignition of the gas effected by suitable means, such as an electrode, inserted in the said annular space at one end of the tubular system, the combustion of the gas then providing sufficient heat to maintain the substrate at the required elevated temperature. The combustible gas used should be one whose products of combustion will not include substances which would be undesirable contaminants of the deposited coating carbon monoxide or other non hydrogencontaining gas or vapour is preferred. The combustible gas may be employed as the carrier gas for the reactant vapours. In the first form of the invention the combustible gas is fed into the inner perforated tube, together with the reactant vapours and, if required an additional carrier gas, while oxygen is passed through the annular space between the inner tube and the substrate tube, so that the combustible gas is ignited on emerging through the perforations into said space. Oxygen is preferably excluded from the gas mixture introduced into the inner tube, or if included is present in an insufficient concentration to support combustion, in order to ensure that combustion takes place only in the outer annulus, and that no back firing into the inner tube can occur. The rate of flow of oxygen into the annulus must of course be considerably in excess of that required for reaction with the halide vapours, to provide sufficient oxygen to effect continuous combustion. If the perforated tube tends to become overheated as a result of the gas combustion taking place around it, it may be necessary to make provision for cooling this tube to prevent distortion thereof, for example by passing cooling fluid, suitably water or nitrogen, through an additional tube disposed inside the perforated tube, the relative diameters of the cooling tube and the perforated tube being such that the flow of gases through the perforations is unimpeded.Alternatively, the perforated tube may be formed of a material having a softening temperature higher than that of silica, for example vitrified alumina or a porous ceramic as aforesaid. A combustible gas may be similarly employed in the second form of the invention in this case the combustible gas is included in the gas mixture introduced into the outer duct, and substantially all the oxygen required for the combustion and the coating forming reaction is preferably fed directly into the annular space between the seed core and the perforated tube, so that combustion takes place only in this space. Alternatively the oxygen may be fed into the outer duct with the other gases, provided that the duct is maintained sufficiently cool to prevent gas combustion from taking place therein. Means for cooling the perforated tube may also be provided. For carrying out the process of the invention, using any of the methods described for activating the reaction, the glass substrate is preferably disposed vertically in the first form of the invention the inner tube is supported from the upper end of the substrate tube, the gases preferably being introduced into the upper end of the tube assembly. Alternatively the process can be carried out with the substrate, perforated tube, and outer tube in the second form of the invention, disposed horizontally. In either case, but especially with the horizontal arrangement, it may be desirable to rotate the substrate continuously about its longitudinal axis, instead of or in addition to the rotation of the perforated tube relative to the substrate, referred to above, in order to avoid the possibility of non uniformity of deposition of the coating over the whole circumference of the substrate. The method of the invention is advantageous in that deposition of the coating is effected simultaneously over the whole of the required length of the substrate, instead of progressively along the substrate as is the case with previously proposed methods of forming the coating by a reaction promoted by either heat or a plasma. The formation of a coating of a desired thickness is thus achieved much more rapidly than in the said previous methods. Furthermore, since the coating is built up continuously, and is not formed in a plurality of discrete layers, a continuous gradation of the composition of the coating can be obtained.Thus for the production of an optical fibre having a graded refractive index, the dopant precursor content of the gaseous reaction mixture is modified continuously, rather than incrementally, to give a continuous gradation of the dopant content of the deposited coating, resulting in a fibre having a smooth refractive index profile. The method also allows large diameter preforms to be easily produced without damage or strain, especially in a static arrangement in which the substrate is not rotated. In addition the use of plasma excitation combined with controlled gas flow distribution allows the deposition to be carried out at lower temperatures without the production of undesirable local variations in deposition quality and quantity, this again favouring the production of large preforms. The larger preforms which can be obtained by this process eneble long continuous lengths of optical fibre to be produced at lower cost per unit length than is possible with smaller preforms. The second form of the invention has the additional advantage that the enclosed system of seed core and surrounding tubes can readily be purged with flowing gases and cleaned with etching or cleaning liquids. The plasma can be controlled by power input, frequency, and variable tuning of the plasma exciting device, to modify or focus the plasma configuration in any desired manner for producing controlled deposition and an improved preform. The precision of the control provided by the plasma technique, suitably modified by electromagnetic field control, combined with pressure and flow control of the gaseoous reaction mixture, enables the system to be operated automatically to produce preforms of improved consistency of composition and dimensions. Some specific methods in accordance with the invention, for the manufacture of optical fibre preforms composed of a doped silica core and silica cladding, will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which Figure 1 shows, in part sectional elevation, apparatus employed for carrying out the method in accordance with the first form of the invention, and Figures 2, 3 and 4 respectively show, in part sectional elevation, three forms of apparatus for carrying out the method in accordance with the second form of the invention. Referring to Figure 1, a vitreous silica substrate tube 1, supported vertically, has an inlet for gas which may be a side tube 2 adjacent to its upper end, or alternatively not shown a tube inserted through a seal at its upper end, and an inner tube 3 of vitreous silica is sealed through a cap 4 closing the upper end of the tube 1, forming an annular space 5 between the tubes 1 and 3. The tube 3 is located coaxially within the substrate tube by means of three silica projections 6 attached to its lower end and abutting against the substrate tube wall, and a short length of closely fitting silica tube 7 with similar projections 8 which is placed over the tube 3 near its upper end.The open upper end 9 of the tube 3 is connected to means not shown for supplying the required mixture of carrier gas and reactant vapour or vapours to this tube, the lower end 10 of the tube 3 is closed, and the wall of the tube 3 is pierced by a multiplicity of perforations 11 shown greatly enlarged to permit egress of the reactant vapours and carrier gas into the space 5 which constitutes the reaction zone. The lower end of the substrate tube 1 is connected to a vacuum pump not shown , for exhaustion of the tube as indicated by the arrow. A microwave cavity 12, formed of an outer cylinder 13 and an inner cylinder 14 of predetermined height, is located adjacent to the gas exit end of the tube 1, the lower end of the tube being inserted through the inner cylinder 14 the cylinder 14 is formed in two portions enabling its height to be adjusted telescopically.Power is supplied to the cavity from a microwave generator 15. A waveguide tube 16 of circular crosssection, formed of high temperature oxidation resistant steel, is also positioned around the substrate tube, extending from the top of the microwave cavity nearly to the gas inlet tube 2, and the tube 16 is surrounded by a tubular electric furnace 17. In a specific form of the apparatus described above with reference to Figure 1, employed for carrying out the process described in the example, the substrate tube 1 has an internal diameter of 16.5 mm and an external diameter of 19 mm, the internal and external diameters of the inner tube 3 are respectively 4 mm and 6 mm, and the perforations 11 are 50 microns in diameter these perforations are conveniently formed by drilling throuh the tube wall with a laser beam the tube has 120 perforations distributed over 15 cm of its length. The waveguide tube 16 has an internal diameter of 6.1 cm, and the tubular furnace 17 has an internal diameter of 7.5 cm.The frequency of the power input to the microwave cavity is 2.45 GHz wavelength 12.2 cm the height of the inner cylinder 14 of the cavity is therefore approx imately 9.15 cm, that is to say 3 4 A , the optimum value being slightly less than this and being found by tuning, which is effected by adjusting the height telescopically.The outer diameter of the inner cylinder, and the inner diameter of the outer cylinder, of the cavity, are respectively 32 mm and 57 mm these dimensions are found to make the overall impedance of the cavity wave guide system match that of the microwave generator and cable, when the system is operated under the conditions described in the following example. In a specific example of the first form of the invention, the apparatus described above with reference to Figure 1 is employed for the production of a step refractive index preform consisting of an undoped silica cladding layer constituted by the substrate tube 1, and a core of silica doped with germania and phosphorous pentoxide, formed by the deposition of a vitreous coating on the interior surface of the tube wall.Initially a stream of argon alone is passed into the inner tube 3, while oxygen alone is passed into the inlet tube 2 and through the annular space 5, and substantially constant power of 300 watts is supplied to the microwave cavity. When the plasma column 18 has been established in the space 5, and the furnace has heated up to the required temperature to maintain the substrate tube wall at 10000C, further streams of argon are bubbled through liquid silicon tetrachloride germanium tetrachloride and phosphorus oxychioride respectively, these streams entraining the chloride vapours are mixed with the main argon stream, and this gaseous mixture is passed into the tube 3, first passing through a capillary tube not shown of 0.5 mm bore and one metre long to control the gas pressure within the tube 3, which is thus maintained at approximately one fifth of an atmosphere. The flows of the respective gas streams are controlled to give constant flow rates of 380 standard cubic centimetres per minute sccm of total argon, 45 sccm of oxygen, 7.8 sccm of silicon tetrachloride, 0.35 sccm of germanium tetrachloride, and 0.5 sccm of phosphorus oxychloride, and the plasma space 4 is evacuated to a constant pressure of approximately one Torr. Under these conditions of gas flow, pressure, temperature and power supply, employed in the manufacture of a specific preform, continuous deposition of glass composed of silica containing 4.5 mol. of germania and 0.5 mol. of phosphorus pentoxide was effected on the substrate tube wall, forming a coating 19 shown in exaggerated thickness over approximately 18 cm of the length of the tube, extending from 1 cm below the topmost perforations in the inner tube to 4 cm below the lowest perforations. During continuous operation for 4.6 hours, the weight of glass deposited on the substrate tube was 4.3 grams, some deposition also occurring on the exterior of the inner tube 3. It should be noted that since the region of the substrate tube in which deposition of a satisfactory vitreous coating occurs is limited by cooling of the end portions of the furnace, the perforations 11 permitting egress of the chloride vapours into the reaction zone 5 are provided only in a part of the wall of the inner tube 3 which corresponds in length and longitudinal position to the region of the substrate tube which can be maintained at the requisite temperature of 1000 C. If deposition on a greater length of substrate tube is required, this can of course be achieved by employing a waveguide tube and furnace of greater length, and increasing the power input to the microwave cavity to extend the plasma column further up the substrate tube. After completion of the deposition process, the inner tube 3 is withdrawn from the substrate tube, and the coated bore of the latter is collapsed and subsequently drawn to fibre, in known manner. The preform produced in the specific example described above gives one kilometre of fibre of core diameter 50 microns and external diameter 120 microns. Referring to Figure 2, a seed rod 20 of vitreous silica is supported vertically along the axis of a silica tube 21 which has a multiplicity of perforations 22 through its wall, the perforations being distributed regularly along the length and around the circumference of the tube. The tube 21 is surrounded by a coaxial outer tube 23, forming an annular reservoir duct 24 around the perforated tube 21, which duct is supplied with gases and vapours through an inlet pipe 25. The outer tube 23 is surrounded by a tubular electric furnace 26. A microwave cavity 27 is positioned around the lower end of the tube 23 preferably the cavity is of the asymmetrical form described above with reference to Figure 1, the inner cylinder of the cavity being located around the lower end of the perforated tube 21.A metal waveguide tube not shown may also be provided, surrounding the tube 23 and within the furnace 26, and extending from the microwave cavity along the whole length of the tube 23. Exhaust outlets 28 are provided at both ends of the annular space 29 between the rod 20 and tube 21. An alternative exhaust means consists of a plurality of perforated tubes passing through the space 29 one such tube is shown at 30, by broken lines. In operation of the arrarigement shown in Figure 2, a gaseous mixture consisting of argon, oxygen, silicon tetrachloride vapour and one or more dopant chloride vapours is passed into the reservoir duct 24 and thence through the perforations 22 into the annular space 29, the gas pressure in the space 29 being maintained lower than that in the duct 24. The power input to the microwave cavity is adjusted, in relation to the gas flow rates and pressure in the space 29, to produce a plasma column 31 extending through the whole length of the space 29. A coating of silica and the dopant oxide or oxides, in either vitreous or particulate form depending upon the gas pressure in the space 29, is built up on the whole surface of the rod 20. The arrangement of Figure 3 differs from that of Figure 2 in the gas flow arrangement. Thus the reservoir duct 24 is divided into two helical ducts for the inflow and outflow respectively of the gaseous mixture, the ducts being respectively connected to an inlet pipe 32 and an exhaust pipe 33 attached to the outer tube 23. The distribution of the perforations 22 is adjusted to provide connections with the respective ducts. In other respects the operation of the arrangement ofFigure 3 is similar to that of the Figure 2 arrangement. In the arrangement shown in Figure 4, the seed core is a vitreous silica tube 34, closed at the lower end and open at the upper end, and a heating element 35 is disposed within the tubular seed. The seed is surrounded by a preforated silica tube 21 and an outer tube 23 with an inlet 25 for gases, as in the arrangement of Figure 2, but no external heating furnace is provided. In operation, the seed tube 34 is maintained at about 100000 by means of the heating element, while the outer tube 23 is maintained at or below room temperature, enabling the perforated tube 21 to be kept considerably cooler than the seed the Tequired gaseous reaction mixture is passed into the annular reaction zone 29, via the duct 24 and perforations 22, and a plasma column 31 is produced by the operation of the microwave cavity 27. The temperature gradient maintained between the seed and the perforated tube ensures that deposition of the required coating material occurs substantially wholly on the seed, with little or no deposition on the tube 21. If necessary, external cooling means not shown may be provided for maintaining the tubes 23 and 21 and duct 24 at the desired relatively low temperatures.
