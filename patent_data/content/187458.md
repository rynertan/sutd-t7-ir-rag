# Polymeric films.

## Abstract
A metallised film comprises a metallised layer 2 bonded to a thermoplastics polymeric substrate 1 , by an adherent layer 4 comprising a sulphonated polyester resin and a triboelectric charge control agent. Fluorinated surfac tants are particularly suitable charge control agents, and a polyester, such as biaxially orientated polyethylene tereph thalate, is a preferred substrate. The films exhibit improved bonding of the metallised layer to the substrate, which bonding may be further enhanced by the inclusion of fine particulate filler in the adherent layer, and are of utility in diverse applications including decorative drapes, magnetic recording media and the packaging of liquids.
