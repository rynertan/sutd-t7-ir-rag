## Description
This invention relates to disperse monoazo dyes and their applicatinn to textile materials. According to the invention, there are provided disperse monoazo dyes, free from sulphonic acid groups, which have the formula EMI1.1 wherein X represents hydrogen, alkyl, alkoxy, alkoxyalkoxy, alkoxyalkoxyalkoxy or alkylthio Y represents hydrogen, chlorine, bromine, alkyl, alkoxy, or acylamino Z represents hydrogen, alkyl or alkoxy R1 represents hydrogen or an optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, aralkyl1 cycloalkyl or aryl radical and R represents hydrogen or an optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl or aralkyl radical. The alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy and alkylthio radicals present in the dyes of the invention are preferably radicals containing up to four carbon atoms. Substituents which may be present on the alkyl radicals in the optionally substituted alkyl radicals represented by R and R2 include hydroxy, alkoxy, cyano, carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl, hydroxyalkoxy, alkoxyalkoxy, alkoxyalkoxycarbonyl, acyloxy and chloro. Acylamino groups which may be represented by Y include groups of the formulae NHOOT and NHSO T2 wherein T1 represents hydrogen, alkyl, alkoxy, aryl, amino, alkylamino or dialkylamino and T2 represents C1 4 alkyl or aryl. Aryl groups which may be present in the dyes of the invention include phenyl and tolyl, aralkyl groups include benzyl and cycloalkyl groups include cyclohexyl and methylcyclohexyl. Particular mention may be made of those dyes in which R2 has the meaning given above and R1 is hydrogen, an optionally substituted alkenyl, aralkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl radical or unsubstituted alkyl. Especially valuable dyes are those in which at least one of R1 and R2 is an unsubstituted alkyl radical, the dyes in which both of R1 and R2 are unsubstituted alkyl being particularly important. The dyes of the invention may be prepared by diazotising a primary amine of the formula EMI2.1 and coupling the resulting diazo compound with an arylamine coupling component of ire formula EMI3.1 wherein X, Y, Z, R and R have tie meanings given above, the amine and the coupling conponent being free from sulphonic acid groups. The primary amines may themselves be prepared by the selective thiohydration of a compound of the formula EMI3.2 using an agent capable of yielding the hydrosulphide ion at a temperature of, for example, 0 250C followed by hydrogen peroxide oxidation of the o amino thioamide so obtained. Agents capable of yielding the hydrosulphide ion include hydrogen sulphide, ammonium hydrogen sulphide, ammonium sulphide and sodium hydrogen sulphide, the reaction conveniently being carried out in an aqueous or non aqueous solvent, for example pyridine, and in the presence of a base, for example triethylamine. As examples of coupling components for use in making the dyes of the invention there may be mentionedN,N diethyl m aminoacetanilide, 2,5 dimethoxyaniline,N,N diethylaniline, N,N di B hydroxyethyl m toluidine,N,N di B cyanoethyl aniline, N ethyl N ss ethoxyethyl aniline,N,N di ss carbomethoxyethyl m toluidine,N ss ss methoxyethoxycarbonyl ethyl m toluidine, 2 methoxy 5 acetylamino N p methoxyethoxJcarbonyl ethyl aniline,N ethyl N ss cyanoethyl aniline,N ethyl N 6 acetoxybutyl aniline, andN ethyl N benzyl m toluidine. The reactions leading to the formation of the dyes of the invention may be performed using conditions that have been fully described in the prior art for such reactions.Similarly the dyes may be isolated by known methods. The dyes of the invention are valuable for colouring synthetic textile materials, in particular secondary cellulose acetate and cellulose triacetate textile materials, polyamide textile materials such as nylon 6 and nylon 66 textile materials and, above all, aromatic polyester textile materials such as polyethylene terephthalate textile materials. Such materials can be in the form of filaments, fibres or woven or knitted materials. The dyes may be applied to the synthetic textile materials by any of the methods conventionally employed for the application of disperse dyes to such materials. hen applied to synthetic textile materials, the dyes of the invention give blue to green shades having excellent fastness to light and to wet and dry treatments. The dyes also have excellent dyeing properties, particularly on aromatic polyester textile materials. The dyes can also be used for the mass coloration of synthetic polymers which are subsequently to be converted into fibres or filaments or they can be applied to synthetic textile materials by the process of transfer colour printing optionally at reduced air pressures or under wet or humid conditions. The invention is illustrated but not limited by the following Examples in which all parts are by weight unless otherwise stated.Example 1 To a stirred solution of 60 parts of 14 86 by volume propionic acetic acid and 30 parts of nitrosyl sulphuric acid are slowly added 7.0 parts of 3 amino 5 cyanoisothiazolo 3,4 bDpyridine and diazotisation is continued for 3 hours at OOC. The clear red solution obtained is added to a rapidly stirred solution of 10 parts of N,N diethyl maminoacetanilide in 80 parts of 1M sulphamic acid and 300 parts of ice water.
