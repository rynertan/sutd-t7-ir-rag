# Button.

## Abstract
A button for being attached to a garment fabric 51 has a button body 11 composed of a double walled tubular stem 14 with an annular flange 15 extending radially outwardly therefrom, a cap 12 mounted on the button body 11 and the cap 12 , and a tack member 40 having a central shank 42 for penetrating the garment fabric 51 into the tubular stem 14 to join the tack member 40 to the button body 11 with the garment fabric 51 interposed therebetween. The annular flange 15 includes a first marginal wall 25 flaring radially outwardly and having a plurality of radially outward projec tions 30 . The cap 12 also has a second marginal wall 33 fitted over the first marginal wall 25 and including a plurality of protuberances 35 deformed radially outwardly by the projections 30 , respectively. The projections 30 and the protuberances 35 are held in interlocking engagement for preventing the button body 11 and the cap 12 from rotating relatively to each other. The shank 42 of the tack member 40 has a tapered end portion 42a which, upon being forced into the button body 11 , is plastically deformable against the back plate 13 laterally into a retainer hood 52 held in locking engagement with the tubular stem 14 .
