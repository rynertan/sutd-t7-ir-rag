## Abstract
A television receiver comprises a video signal receiving circuit for receiving a video signal, a vertical synchronising signal and a horizontal synchronising signal, a signal processing circuit for supplying the video signal to a cathode ray tube, a vertical deflection circuit for supplying a vertical deflection signal to the cathode ray tube in response to the vertical synchronising signal, and a horizontal deflection circuit for supplying a horizontal deflection signal to the cathode ray tube in response to the horizontal synchronising signal. A frequency detector circuit 31 is connected to the video signal receiving circuit for detecting the frequency of the horizontal synchronising signal and deriving a control signal in response thereto, and a control circuit 12 is connected between the frequency detector circuit 31 and the horizontal deflection circuit for controlling the horizontal deflection circuit in response to the control signal from the frequency detector circuit 31 . The horizontal deflection circuit includes a circuit 80 for changing the duty cycle of a horizontal drive pulse such that the duty cycle increases when the horizontal frequency becomes higher.
