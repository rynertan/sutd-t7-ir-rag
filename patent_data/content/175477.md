# Organopolysiloxane composition paintable after room temperature curing.

## Abstract
Room temperature curing organopolysiloxane composi tions which are paintable after curing can be made by mixing hydroxyl terminated organopolysiloxane, a paintability com pound which contains at least one X RÂ¹ O silicon bonded group and at least one aminoxy or amido group bonded to a sili con atom where X is
