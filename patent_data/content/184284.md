# Control system for a hydraulic circuit of a vehicle.

## Abstract
A vehicle control system has a system part 5 with a pump 6 feeding an open centre valve 4 which controls power assistance for vehicle steering. A second system part 11 has a pump 16 feeding an accumulator 13 and a closed centre valve 10 which controls operation of a clutch or brake booster 2 . The pumps 6 and 16 are simul taneously driven by a motor 18 . A by pass valve 21 in conduit 20 is responsive through a pressure transducer 22 and an electrical control unit 19 to pressure in the accumulator 13 so that when the accumulator pressure attains a predetermined value the by pass valve 21 opens communication between the output from pump 16 and a reservoir 7 to relieve the load on the motor 18 . A pressure regulating valve 23 is provided in the steering system part 5 . The valve 23 is responsive to pressure from the output of the second pump 16 through conduit 28 and permits the output from the pump 6 to flow by way of conduits 24 and 9 to the reservoir 7 when the pressure from the pump 16 attains a predetermined value so that the pressure available to the valve 4 is less than the maximum pressure available from the output of the pump 6 and the load on the motor 18 which is attributable to it driving the pump 6 is relieved. The valve 23 is preferably a spring loaded spool valve displaceable by expansion of a chamber through the admission of fluid from conduit 28 .
