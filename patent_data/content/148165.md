## Description
fITLF POST FOR AN ERRINGFIELD OF TI E INVENTION This invention relates to a post for an earring or like article of jcweky, v hich of necessity must have an extremely small diameter for it to pass through a small perforation in the earlobe of the user. In particular, the present invention relates to a post for an earring to be used by persons having pierced earlobes. The invention also relates to a method of manufacture of the earring post of the present invention, by which the earring post can be produced on an automated mass production basis. BACKGROUND TO THE flVENON Commonly down earring constructions used by persons having pierced earlobes include a post attached to a rear face of the earring, and which is to be passed through a perforation in the users earlobe, and then retained in that position by applying a separate retainer member to the end of the post. The retainer member usually is comprised of a threaded cap member which is screw threaded onto the end of the post. Such t eEced cap members are difficult to apply to the post at the time the post extends behind the user s earlobe, and are prone to be dropped by the user and possibly lost. Another form of retainer member is in the form of a pair of spring loaded jaws which are mounted on an apertured plate. The plate is S id onto the pest, and is secured to the post by the frictional grip of spring loaded jaws and thus restrained against accidental removal from the pnst. AgL..n, this form of retainer member is difficult to apply to the post, in that the user must align the post and the aperture in the plate and tinen overcome the pressure exerted by the spring loaded jaws in order to permit the plate to be slid onto the end of the post. Structures have been proposed which eliminate the d sadvantage of having a post and a separate retainer member which is to be applied to the post. One such structure is disclosed in British Patent No. 1440, issued 1884, which provides a post for an earring having a bifurcated or slotted end within which a retainer member is located. The retainer is secured within the slotted end of the post by a small pivot pin which extends transversely through the end of the post and the retainer member, and which permits rotation of the retainer member from a position in which it is axially aligned with the post to a position in which it extends transverse to the end of the post. A similar structure has been proposed in West German Patent No. 31030, also issued in 1884, which also employs a retainer member pivotally mounted within a slotted end of the post. T eally, a post for an earring has a diameter of only 33 one thousandths of an inch. To accurately slot such a post longitudinally through one third of its width requires milling, sawing, or otherwise forming a slot having a width of only 11 one thousandths of an inch, End to high manuracturing tolerances if smooth operation of the retainer member is to be insured. Also, the retainer member must be accurately form finished for thet port on which extends through the slotted end of the post to have a thickness of 11 one ThousandThs of one inch or less. white both of these previously proposed structures are admirable in thcir intent, they have not found commercial acceptance. PoFsibly those structures could not be manufactured on a mass production cCrnmerc al scale owing to the extremely small dimensions of the structures involved, and the required accuracy of the machining operations. The production of the previously proposed structures by micro machining operations is feasible using modern machines and micro machining techniques. However, the high cost of such micro machining operations precludes their use in conventional mass production techniques. TITLE INVENTION According to the present invention, the problems of making and assembling the earring post and retainer member construction, may be overcome by eliminating the slot in the end of the post, and by instead forming the post and retainer member of complementary shapes which resdily can be massproduced by modern mass production techniques without resorting to micro machining techniques. may be The post of the present inventionAxformed at one of its ends with a longitudinally extending recess, and is of a transverse crosssection at that end which is preferebly a segment of a circle.The retainer member is fo. med at one of its ends for it to have a transverse crossseetion comp ementary to that of the post end, such that the retainer me ntDer, when axially aligned with the post, constitutes an axial continuation of the post in the substantial absence of any surface discontinuities along the length of the post and retainer member. The axially spaced end surfaces of the said one end of the post may be formed as surfaces that extend transverse to the longitudinal axis of the st at oppositely inclined angles, and, the axially speeded end surfaces of said one end of the retainer meitber are formed for them to be complementary to those of the end surfaces of the post. In tllis manner, it is insured that the retainer member is restrained against rotation in one direction and held aligned with the post during the insertion of the post and retainer member through the users pierced earlobe. The retainer member is pivotally connected to the said one end of the post by a pin, the pin extending transversely through the post and retainer member, and being secured therein in any convenient manner egainst axial displacement relative to the post and the retainer member.The pin may be a separate pin which is inserted through aligned apertures in the post and retainer member, or, according to the method of the present invention, the pin is formed integrally with either the post or the retainer member by cold working the metal of that member to form the pin from the metal comprising that member, and preferably is formed by cold working the metal of that member to extrude the metal directly into an aperture in the other member and effect formation and securing of the pin in a single operation DESCRIPTION OF WE DRAWINGS The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, which are illustrative of preferred embo ments of the present invention, and in which Figure 1 is a fragmentary elevation of an end of an earring post showing the retainer member aligned with the er,d of the post Figure 2 is a transverse cress section taken Belong line 2 2 of the carving post illustrated in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a longitudinal section through the end of the earring post illustrated in Figure 1 Figure 4 is an elevation corresponding with Figure 1, but showing a retainer member of the earring post displaced from axial alignment with the post Figure 5 is a longitudinal section correspondin with Figure 2, and illustrating an alternative manner of securing the retainer member to the end of the post Figure 6 is a diagramatic illustration of the method eccording to the present invention of forming the post, pivot pin, and retainer assembly and, Figure 7 is a diagramatic illustration of an alternative method according to the present invention of forming the post, pivot pin, and retainer assembly. Referring to the drawings, that part of the post 10 which extends rearward of the earring is illustrated. Typically, the post 10 wil be formed from a fine metal such as gold, platinum, or silver. If the pzst is formed of silver, then, preferably it is electroplated with white gold or rhodium to Inhibit oxidation of the silver. Alternatively, the post c be fort wed from a surgical quality stainless steel, or, can be formed from E base metal such as copper or brass appropriately coated with a hypo allergenic lacquer, or appropriately electroplated with a fine metal. As more clearly appears in Figure 4, the post 10 is recessed at its end to provide a plantar surface 12 extending substantially lrgitudinaii y of the post, the post being preferably of semi circular cross tion at its end. The planar surface 12 terminates at its opposite ends in oppositely inclined surfaces 14, 16 extending transversely of the post 10. Pivotally mounted on the end of the post 10 by means of a pin 18 is a retainer member or swivel 20, which is formed with surfaces complementary to the surfaces 12, 14 and 16 of the post end. The pin 18, which is preferably formed from a ductile fine metal, is peened over at its ends, thus preventing separation of the retainer member 20 from the end of the post 10, and prohibiting axial withdrawal or displacement of the pin 18. The retainer member 20 is of a transverse crosssection complementary to that of the end of the post, and, includes oppositely inclined surfaces 14a, 16a complementary to the surfaces 14, 16 of the post end, such that, when the retainer member is aligned with the axis of the post, the retainer member constitutes a continuation of the post in the substantial absence of any surface discontinuities.In this position, the swivel is restrained against movement in a clockwise direction by virtue of the abutment of the opposed end faces 14, 14a and 16, 16a, thus faciliating insertion of the retainer member and post through a perforation in the ustr earlobe. As an alternative to the end faces being formed as plantar surfaces, they can be of any appropriate form p. onsed that they interfit and restrain the swivel aligned with the post. Upon final insertion of the post, the retainer member 20 is positionea beyond the flesh of the earlobe and can then be swiveled about the pin 18 from its position axially aligned with the post 10 to a position extending transversely thereof, thus prohibiting withdrawal of the post 10 from the user s earlobe until such time as the retainer member is repositioned for It to be axially aligned with the post 10. The respective post end and retainer member readily can be formed on a continuous mass production basis and in the absence of specialized micro machinery by drop forging or pressing. If desired, the post and the retainer member can be formed integrally with each other in a single operation, together with the apertures for reception of the pin 18, and then severed from each other along the mating faces 16, 14a. In this manner, both members are formed economically in a single operation. Alternatively, the post and the retainer member can.formed separately in a continuous operation. Subsequent to the formation of the post and the retainer member, the respective members can be subjected to a tumbling operation for the purpose of polishing down any nashing or sharp edges which may have occurred in the forming operations. The respective components can then be automatically sorted and assembled, and then pinned to each other by an appropriate pin inserting mechanism capable of upsetting the ends of the pin to produce the required axial location of the pin. Subsequent to final essembly of the post and its retainer member, the assembly is then preferably subjected to a finish polishing operation in a tumbling barrel. As an alternative to the separate insertion of the pin 18, either the post end or the retainer member can be formed to provide the pin, as illustrated in Figure 5. In Figure 5, the pin 1 boa is shown as formed integrally with the retainer member 20, such that it can be passed through an aperture in the end of post 10, and then expanded by an a ropriate punch to secure the respective members to cach other in pivotal e ationRhip. Referring now to Figure 6, there is diagramatically illustrated the method of the present invention of forming and securing the pivot pin in a single operation. In Figure 6, the post 10 and the retainer member 20 are inserted into the bore of closed forming die 25. In the example illustrated, the retainer member 20 has been previously perforsted to provide a pin receiving aperture 18b. Alternatively, the post 10 can be provided with the pin receiving aperture. The post and retainer member are then compressed axially by an Pnally moveable punch 26 with sufficient force to cause cold flow of the metal of the post into and through the perforation in the retainer member, thus simultaneously forming the pivot pin and pivotally attaching the retainer member to the post. Alternatively, and as illustrated diagramatically inFigure 7, the pin and retainer member are confined within the chamber of a hydroforming die 28, and are subjected to radially inward pressure in the vicinity of the perforation to compress the post and retainer member sufficiently to cause the metal of the post to cold now and extrude into the aperture of the retainer member.The hydroforming die 28 is actuated by hydraulic fluid P under pressure, which acts on a flexible tubular aieph. Egm wall 29 to transmit the pressure of the fluid to the post and retainer. In both Figure 6 and Figure 7, an axially moveable end stop 30 is provided for positioning and holding the post and retainer member in alignment and for subsequently ejecting the so formed and assembled post, retainer member and pivot pin. Optionally, and ss illustrated in Figure 7 the post end retainer member can be subjected simultaneously or sequentially to both axial co lpress ve force by the punch n6 end the diaphragm wall 29. After final polishing, the assembled post and retainer member are then available for attachment to the frame or body of the erring by soldering, tack welding, or by any other appropriate operation. l3 pical dimensions of the assembled post and retaining member are a post ength of 7 16 inch, a slstivel length of 3 16 inch, a post diameter 33 one thousandths inch, and a radius of the respective post and swivel ends of 16.5 one thousandths of an inch. Typically, the pin 18 will be 12 one thousandths of an inch in diameter, and further, typically, the respective elements will each be formed of 10 to 18 karat white or yellow gold. As milling or sawing operations are eliminated in their entirety, the respective elements can be formed in almost the total absence of metal losses, thus eliminating to the greatest possible extent the need to salvage or recover taiIings or machinings. As will be appreciated, various modification may be made in the preferred embodiments described above without departing from the scope of the appended claims.
