# Electron beam exposure apparatus.

## Abstract
An electron beam exposure apparatus includes a compen sation signal generator 28, 31, 33 34, 39, 38 for generating a compensation signal to correct a positioning error of the electron beam caused by a transient response characteristic of the electron beam exposure apparatus. The positioning error is detected by using a knife edge type gauge 70 and a reflecting electron detector 74 and the compensation signal to compen sate for the error is produced in a compensation signal generator. The compensation signal is applied via an electron beam deflec tion device 5, 6 to deflect the electron beam 7 to reduce the deviation from the position of the electron beam caused by the transient response characteristics of the apparatus.
