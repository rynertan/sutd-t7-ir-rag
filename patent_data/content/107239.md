# Differential pulse code modulation transmission system.

## Abstract
Differential pulse code modulation transmission system comprising a transmitter and a receiver. In the transmitter 1, there is subtracted from an information signal x n to be transmitted a prediction signal y n for the purpose of generat ing a difference signal e n , which is quantized and converted into a quantized difference signal in a quantizing arrangement 6. This difference signal is applied to a prediction circuit 7 for generating the prediction signal. It is also transmitted to the associated receiver. In that receiver a similar prediction signal is generated by means of a similar prediction circuit, which prediction signal is now added to the received quantized differ ence signal. In order to limit the influence of transmission er rors in this transmission system, without an excessive in crease in equipment, the quantized difference signal is applied in the transmitter and in the receiver to a cascade arrangement of a non linear network 16 and an auxiliary prediction circuit 17, which produces an auxiliary prediction signal. Before the quan tized difference signal is applied to the prediction circuit the auxiliary prediction signal is first added thereto.
