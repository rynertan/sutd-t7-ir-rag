# Apparatus and method for recovering energy from pressurised reactor effluent.

## Abstract
A system for recovering energy from a pressured reactor 10 comprising a reactor 10 , a reciprocating engine 21, 22, 23, 24 connected to the reactor to receive reaction effluent from said reactor thereby driving the pistons 56 of the reciprocating engine by expansion of the effluent and recovery apparatus 27 downstream of the engine for recovering products from the effluent. The expanding reactor effluent is used to drive the pistons which are in one embodiment especially valved in conjunction with the effluent inlet port 41 in the cylinder 40 to facilitate handling the effluents, the pistons in turn operate a crankshaft 30 through a crosshead 62 which may power compressors 11 or operate a generator to produce elec tricity. In another embodiment the inlet valves 146 to the cylinders of the engine are operated by independently time adjustable actuating means 117, 144 , thereby making possible recovery of substantially more energy in a directly usable form.
