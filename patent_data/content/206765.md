The synthesis requires the use of The isolation of E 1,5 bis 3 ,4 dihydroxyphenyl pent 4 en 1 yne 4 ,4 di β D glucopyranoside, Hypoxoside, from The overall process according to the invention comprises the synthesis of a protected hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde or a corresponding allylic haloalkane and the reaction thereof with an alkylating agent such as phenylacetylide anion or a protected hydroxyphenyl acetylide anion to form a variety of substituted pent 4 en 1 yne compounds followed by deprotection to yield the hydroxy derivatives. According to one aspect the present invention provides a process for preparing compounds of formula I The process according to the invention is preferably a process as hereinbefore described for preparing compounds of formula I Further, according to the invention a protected or unprotected compound may be glycosylated with a halosugar to yield a glycoside. Thus, according to a further aspect the present invention provides a process for preparing compounds of formula IX In a preferred form of the invention the phenolic hydroxy groups in caffeic acid ester are protected by their conversion to silyl ethers by using Direct reduction of silyloxycaffeic acid to the alcohol may be achieved by its treatment with B₂H₆. The conversion of the alcohol to the corresponding halide proceeds smoothly by conventional methods. The silyl ether of 3,4 dihydroxyphenylacetylene may be prepared as shown in SCHEME 2 by By treating 3 3 ,4 Glycosylation of the phenolic hydroxy groups by the classical Koenigs Knorr rection Koenigs et al, A solution of caffeic acid 10.0 g, 0.055 mol in a mixture of benzene 300 ml , ethanol 80 ml and H₂SO₄ conc. 5 ml is refluxed for 34 hours. The cooled dark green reaction mixture is neutralized with a saturated aqueous NaHCO₃ solution. The aqueous layer is then extracted with ether 3 x 15 ml , dried MgSO₄ and the combined organic extracts concentrated to yield a brown crystalline product 9.0 g, 78 . Recrystallization from ethyl acetate yielded the ethyl ester of caffeic acid as a light brown crystalline product 5.98 g, 52 mp 143 146 C δ DIBAH 175 mg, 0.137 mmol in toluene 3.3 ml is added to a solution of the disilyl ether of the ester 4 500 mg, 0.114 mmol in toluene 1.5 ml at 78 C over a period of 1 hour. The reaction mixture is then allowed to reach room temperature when it is quenched with saturated aqueous NH₄Cl 10 ml and extracted with ethyl acetate 3 x 10 ml . The combined extracts are dried MgSO₄ and concentrated to provide a light yellow oil of 3 3 ,4 di MnO₂ 2.95 g 0.034 mol is added to a solution of 3 3 ,4 A suspension of activated zinc 1.90 g, 0.029 mol, 2 eqv , triphenylphosphine 7.60 g, 0.0029 mol, 2 eqv and carbon tetrabromide 9.60 g, 0.029 mol, 2 eqv in dry CH₂Cl₂ 20 ml is stirred for 30 hours under N₂. To this Wittig reagent is added 3,4 di To a solution of 3,4 di A solution of the phenolic compound 1 eqv , Bromoethane 1 mol equiv is added dropwise to a stirred mixture of magnesium metal 1.05 mol equiv and tetrahydrofuran under anhydrous conditions and a N₂ atmosphere. Once the exothermic reaction has subsided, the reaction mixture is refluxed for 10 minutes, cooled to 20 C and the alkyne as in SCHEMES 1 and 2 1.05 mol equiv dissolved in THF is added dropwise. Ethane is evolved during the formation of the phenylacetylide magnesium bromide. The mixture is then refluxed for 45 minutes and cooled to 20 C. Dry cuprous chloride is added to the phenylacetylide magnesium bromide containing reaction mixture which is then stirred for 15 minutes before the alkyl halide as in SCHEME 1 and 2 1.05 mol eqv dissolved in THF is added dropwise. The green suspension is refluxed for 45 minutes before an aqueous solution of ammonium chloride and KCN is added followed by ether extraction and work up to yield the corresponding pent 4 ene 1 yn products. As example compound 16 R H , as in SCHEME 1, was synthesised by the same method. The phenylacetylide magnesium bromide containing reaction mixture as prepared by method VII is cooled to 0 C and the alkanal as in SCHEME 2 dissolved in THF is added dropwise maintaining the temperature between 0 5 C. After all the alkanal has been added the reaction mixture is stirred for a further 2.5 hours at 25 C and then poured into a saturated aqueous solution of NH₄Cl followed by ether extraction and work up to yield the corresponding pent 4 ene 1 yn 3 ol products. As example compound 17 was synthesised by this method A mixture of cuprous chloride and 13 1 mol eqv , as prepared by procedure V, in dry tetrahydrofuran is stirred for 15 minutes before the alkyl halide as in SCHEME 2 1.1 mol eqv dissolved in dry THF is added dropwise.

Deprotection of these provide, for example, compound 14 as described under Procedure XI. A THF solution of the phenylacetylide 13 as prepared by procedure V is cooled to 0 C and the alkanal in dry THF is added dropwise maintaining the temperature between 0 5 C. After all alkanal has been added the mixture is stirred for a further 2.5 hours at 25 C and then poured into a saturated aqueous solution of NH₄Cl followed by extraction with ether and work up to yield the corresponding pent 4 ene 1 yn 3 ol products. As example compounds 7 and 8, as in SCHEME 2, have been synthesised by this method. To a solution of the silyl ether 1 eqv in dry THF is added tetraethyl ammonium fluoride 1.2 eqv per silyl ether group in dry THF over a period of 15 minutes and the resulting mixture is stirred for an additional 3 hours at 23 C. The cooled reaction mixture is diluted with water and extracted several times with ethyl acetate. The combined extracts are dried MgSO₄ and evaporated under reduced pressure.

Standard workup procedure followed to yield, after colum chromatography, the different anomeric glucosides as in SCHEME 2. Methanolic KOH 4 was added to a stirred solution of the tetraacetate or tetrabenzoate in CHCl₃ and the solution heated to just below the boiling point for 30 minutes. The resultant mixture was allowed to stand for 3 hours before it is again heated and stirred for 30 minutes. This procedure was repeated until t.l.c. checks showed that hydrolysis was complete. The reaction was worked up by standard procedures to yield a mixture of anomeric glucosides. As example compound 15 as in SCHEME 2 has been synthesised by this method.
