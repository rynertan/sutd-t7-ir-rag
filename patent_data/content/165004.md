# IMPROVING THE PROPERTIES OF LAND

## Abstract
Sludge containing plant nutrients is added direct to land and the sludge is treated with a flocculant before being injected below the surface of the land. The sludges are for instance raw sewage sludges and the flocculant is generally a cationic acrylic polymer, for example formed of monomers of dialkylaminoalkyl methl acrylamides having a molecular weight in the range 500,000 to 30 million. The flocculated sludge can be added in large quantities then unflocculated sludge without spillage onto the surface.
