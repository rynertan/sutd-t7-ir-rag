# Demodulation circuit from FM signals and demodulation system therefor.

## Abstract
The demodulation circuit of frequency modulated sig nals comprises a variable phase shifter 9 supplied with inputted FM signals, a narrow band pass filter 10 having a band width narrower than that of the Curson band for the FM signals, a frequency discriminator 4 , a filter 11 allowing to pass specific frequency components among the FM detected signals detected by the frequency discriminator, and a phase adjuster 12 to said frequency components, wherein said inputted FM signals are passed through said variable phase shifter 9 said narrow band pass filter 10 and then FM detected by said frequency discriminator 4 , a portion of the detected output signals is passed through said filter 11 allowing to pass the specific frequency components and the phase adjuster 12 , thereafter, the phase shifter 9 is controlled by said signals, the phase of the FM signals is controlled by the phase shifter 9 in the direction of compressing the frequency deviation of said specific demod ulated frequency components in the FM signals, and de tected signals from said frequency discriminator are taken out.
