# Picture information processing and storing device.

## Abstract
A picture information processing and storing device includes a page buffer 18 for storing original picture information for one scanning line in each row thereof, a line buffer 240 for storing original picture information for each row, a read only memory 248 in which a run length code to MH code conversion table is stored, and address designation circuit 246 for supplying address data to the read only memory in response to each original picture data read out from said line buffer 240 , a shift register circuit 251 for successively storing data from the read only memory 248 , and an EOL code generator 252 for providing an end of line code after MH code data corresponding to original picture infor mation stored in said line buffer 240 when the entire MH code data is stored in the page buffer.
