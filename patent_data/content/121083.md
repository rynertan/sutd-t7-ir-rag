## Description
Low Temperature Crosslinking of Water Borne Resins This invention pertains to the crosslinking of water borne resins and more Particularly to a low temperature process which utilizes polycarbodiimides. Almost every man made item has a surface coating which serves a decorative and often additionally a protective role. One type of grouping of surface coatings is a division into systems which must be baked at high temperatures for proper curing and those which cure at ambient temperature or with low temperature baking. These different coating types are utilized on different substrates. For example, the hiqh bake coatings are employed on items such as automobile fenders which are cured at high temperature. The low bake coatings would be employed typically for wooden window frames in a home. Traditionally, all of these coating systems were solvent based that is, the coating components were dissolved or suspended in an organic material. Several factors in recent years have contributed to a shift from solvent based coatings to water based coatings. These factors include the easier clean up of water borne systems, the increasing cost of solvents, and the increasing awareness of the potential harm by organic solvents to the environment. This shift has created intense efforts aimed at reformulating coatings from solvent based to water based systems. For high bake systems which are cured or crosslinked utilizing melamine or methlyolamide chemistry, the reformulation is rather straiqht forward. However, in the conversion of the low bake solvent systems to water based formulations, many difficulties have been encountered. A description of the chemistries of the curing reactions of the low bake solvent systems is needed for understanding of the difficulties in formulating a crosslinkable water based low bake coating system. There are three representative classes of chemistries available for the curing of low bake solvent based systems. For systems termed moisture cure urethanes, polymeric or oligomeric materials are prepared containing residual isocyanate functionality. A coating is prepared from these materials and applied to the particular substrate chosen. Humidity from the air diffuses into the coating, reacting with the isocyanate to release carbon dioxide resulting in the free amine which reacts rapidly with the remaining isocyanate providing the crosslinking mechanism. Conversion of this type of system to a water based system would be difficult due to hiqh reactivity of the isocyanate with water. A second type of curing system for low bake solvent systems is the alkene system.In this system a polymeric or oligomeric material is formed by ionic reactions in such a manner and with such materials so as to yield residual double bond functionality. Upon formulation with a catalyst and upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen, the residual double bonds cure by free radical reactions. Most water based polymers are prepared by free radical reactions in which the polymer preparation stage would tend to cause premature reaction of the alkene double bonds. Some systems have been designed to attempt to utilize the alkene curing reaction for crosslinking, but these systems are difficult to drive to high levels of functionality and thus high levels of crosslinking without attendant problems with reaction rate control and deqree of reaction are not achieved.The third representative class of chemistries available for curing low bake solvent based coatings involves silicone reactions.Typically, polymeric or oligomeric materials are prepared containing alkoxysilane or acyloxysilane functionality. Upon application of the solvent solution of such materials to the substrate and exposure to the atmosphere, silanes rapidly react with atmospheric moisture to cause hydrolysis to the silanols. These silanols condense to silyloxy crosslinks. This type of system has been attempted in water based coatings, but the presence of water along with the water reactive silanes usually causes premature reaction. From this description the difficulties of developing a water based low bake crosslinking system are apparent. Nevertheless, the need for such a system has remained strong. Water borne low bake noncrosslinkable coatings are currently employed, for example in interior wall paints.However, such systems are deficient in key aualities and exhibit undesirable properties, such as, high tack, low solvent resistance, and low abrasion resistance. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a facile system for crosslinking water borne resins at low, that is, ambient temperatures. It is another object of this invention to provide a low temperature system which affords crosslinked water borne resins suitable for coating various substrates. It is a further object of this invention to provide low temperature cross linked water borne resin coatings which exhibit low tack, hiqh solvent resistance and bigh abrasion resistance. Other objects will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the specification. A method has been found for crosslinking water borne, carboxyl containinq latex resins and neutralized water soluble organic resins which comprises a blending said resins at ambient temperatures with about 0.5 to about 30 parts per 100 parts of said resins of an emulsified or water soluble polyfunctional polycarbodiimide derived from the reaction of mono di and tri cycloaliphatic or saturated aliphatic isocyanates wherein the cycloaliphatic moieties contain from 5 to about 7 carbons and can be substituted with alkyl having 1 to about 6 carbons and oxygen, and the saturated aliphatic moieties contain from 1 to about 18 carbons, wherein the mono and triisocyanates are optional and b applying the blend to a substrate while allowing volatile formulated components to volatilize. Pressure temperature and time are not critical, although the reaction will increase in rate at hither temperatures as expected. No special equipment is required for the blending operation which can be carried out batchwise or continuously. Three steps are employed in the practice of this invention synthesis, emulsification, and formulation. In the first step of the synthesis, the polycarbodiimides are prepared by reaction of mono , di and tri isocyanates with the easiest structures to conceptualize being based on mono and diisocyanates in the molar ratio of about 2 1 to about 2 10 to yield the carbodiimide with evolution of carbon dioxide by the following general equation EMI5.1 This process usually requires a catalyst, and a Preferred catalyst is 3 methyl l phenyl 2 phospholene l oxide having the formula EMI5.2 It is not necessary to use a triisocyanate. A combination of mono and diisocyanates in a molar ratio of about 2 2 to about 2 4 is preferred. The reaction is preferably accomplished in non reactive solvents, such as, aromatic hydrocarbons having 6 to about 12 carbons, aliphatic esters or glycol diesters, amyl acetate, butyl acetate, propyl propionate, ethyl butyrate, Yylene, toluene, diethyl benzene, benzene, diethylene glycolether diacetate, dipropylene glycol ether dibutyrate and hexylene glycol diacetate having about 8 to 20 carbons. The reaction is stirred vigorously, and a small amount of nitroqen is sparqed to assist in driving the reaction to completion by removal of carbon dioxide. Generally mixtures of isocyanates are employed with the relative molar proportions of mono , d and tri isocyanates adjusted to yield the desired product.Isocyanates which may be employed include butyl isocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, hexamethylene diioscyanate, trimethylheramethylene diisocyanate, bisisocyanatocyclohexyl methane, and trishexamethylene diisocyanate biuret. In a typical preparation, two moles of butyl isocyanate are reacted with three moles of isophorone diisocyanate to yield an oligomeric polycarbodiimide having approximately four moles of carbodiimide functionality barring any side reactions. These reactants are charged to approximately 50 by weight of reactants in amyl acetate along with about 0.3 by weight of the catalyst.The mixture would be continuously sparged with a small amount of nitroqen and stirred vigorously while heated to approximately 1400C and held until complete conversion of the isocyanate to the carbodiimide is observed in the infrared spectrum. Many variations on this synthesis regime will be apparent to one skilled in the art. While the saturated aliphatic isocyanates previously listed include the more widely available commercial materials, many others can be used as exemplified by 1,4 tetramethylene diisocyanate 1, 12 dodecane diisocyanate cyclobutane 1.3 diisocyanate cyclohexane 1.3 diisocyanate cyclohexane 1.4 diisocyanage hexabydrotolylene 2,4 and 2,6 diisocyanate While the solvents previously listed are currently preferred, many other solvents would be suitable. Requirements for suitable solvents include having a sufficiently high boiling point to allow efficient accomplishment of the desired reaction and that the solvent not contain active hydrogen functionality such as would react with the isocyanate starting material or the carbodiimide product.Exemplary solvents include ethylbutylketone, acetophenone, propiophenone, dissobutylketone, cyclohexanone, decalin, methylCELLOSOLVE acetate, CELLOSOLVE acetate, butylCELLOSOLVE acetate, CARBITOL acetate, butyl CARBITOL acetate, qlycoldiacetate. Many variations of the catalyst are employable. Examples include the nonoxidized phospholene compound as well as the phospholene sulfide. Additional alternatives include substitutions on and for the phenyl group attached to the phosphorous atom such as by the ethyl moiety. Additional substitutions on the cyclic phosphorous ring can be made, as for example hydrogen, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkoxy, chlorine, and bromine. The process need not be operated at 1400C for acceptable product has been produced at 1300C to l600C. Operation below 1200C may yield unacceptably long cycle times while operation at 1600C or above may yield undesired quantities of by Product. The second step of the invention involves the conversion of the polycarbodiimide solution into a form which is usable in water based systems. In this step, the polycarbodiimide solution, a surfactant, and water are mixed to yield an emulsion. In a typical preparation, about 20g of a polycarbodiimide solution beinq at about 50 activity in an organic solvent such as amyl acetate is mixed with about 50q of a 2 solution of AEROSOLA 196 American Cyanamide Trademark for a series of sodium dialkyl sulfosuccinates and with about 309 additional of water. The resultant non homogeneous mixture is mixed vigorously in a high shear environment such as a Waring blender, a VirTisUltrashear mixer, or a Silversen mixer.The resultant material thus appears as a low viscosity opaque liauid with the polycarbodiimide well dispersed in the continuous phase. One additional component, a volatile amine, is sometimes employed to insure that the system pH is maintained adequately high. Exempl ary volatile amines include dimethylamine, trimethylamine, monoethylamine, diethylamine and the like. The making of the emulsion of the polycarbodiimide solution may be varied widely. For example, the levels of the reactant carbodiimide and the stabilizer may be widely varied as may the type of surfactant employed. The nature of the surfactant and possibly cosolvent system will have a strong influence on the degree, type and time of system mixinq reauired. Finally, the use of amine provides added protection against hydrolysis of the carbodiimide. The type and level of this amine may differ widely. Finally, with respect to the emulsification step, by modification of the synthesis procedure the polycarbodiimide may be prepared in such a manner that it is water soluble, obviating the need for the emulsion. This procedure may be accomplished by replacement of some or all of the butyl isocyanate with dimethylaminopropylamine followed by reaction with methyl p toluene sulfonate or dimethyl sulfate. The resultant quarternary salt provides water solubility for use in water based coatings. The third aspect of the invention involves the formulation of the polycarbodiimide salt or emulsion. Tbe key requirement of the formulation is that the latex or emulsion polymer or semi solubilized colloidal polymer or solution polymer in water contain the carboxylic acid functionality. Many systems have the carboxylic acid functionality from copolymerization of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, or itaconic acid.Alternatively, maleic, fumaric or crotonic acid may be employed. The level of acid in the polymer can be extremely variable, from 1 to 40 by weight. However, the 5 region is estimated to be hiqhly useful. While the basic ingredients of the crosslinked coating are the carboxylated polymer and the crosslinker polycarbodiimide, many additional ingredients may be present to serve useful roles for special applications. For example, pigments, fillers, and colorants may be used to provide hidinq power and decorative effects. Water soluble polymers may be employed for control of coating rheology, while dispersants and foaming or defoaming agents may additionally be required. As the examples to be presented subsequently show, a wide latitude is present in practical application, and the normally skilled practitioner could envisage numerous additional uses for the concepts of the invention. The unexpected findings of the present invention may be appreciated by comparison to the current systems. Previously, water borne low bake systems based on silicone, isocyanate, and alkene functionality were described. In comparing the polycarbodiimide carboxylic acid to these previous systems, the present invention gives greater shelf life or pot life as compared to the isocyanate system. In comparison to the silicone system, the system of the present invention provides more formulation latitude as well as eliminatinq the usual problems inherent in the use of silicon systems.Third, upon comparison to the alkene systems, the ease of reproducibility of the preparation of carboxylated polymers compared to the preparation of polymers containing residual alkene by free radical means allows the polycarbodiimide carboxylated polymer system to be more reproducible. In the searcb for systems which would crosslink water based low bake systems, others have developed a system which crosslinks under the desired conditions. That system is based on the aziridine ring and is composed of the use of multifunctional aziridines to crosslink carboxylated polymers. For comparison of the present invention with the aziridine system, it was found that the present system had a longer shelf life in the formulated form. chile properties of the aziridine system began to fall off with time, requiring replenishment of the aziridine component, the polycarbodiimide did not show th diminishment with timer thus indicating a longer shelE life. The following examples provide the data in support of this invention disclosure. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. The following groupings of the data may be of interest Example 1 shows the preparation of an aliphatic polycarbodiimide while Example 2 shows the preparation of an aromatic polycarbodiimide.

Examples 8 12 show the general utility of aliphatic polycarbodiimides. Examples 13 shows that a water soluble aliphatic polycarbodiimide may be synthesized. Examples 14 17 show that a wide variety of structures may be prepared using this general procedure.
