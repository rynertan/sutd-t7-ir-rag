# BELT CLAMPING APPARATUS WITH SELF ALIGNING FEATURE

## Abstract
A belt clamping apparatus is disclosed including a pivotal lever over which the belt is directed. A universal mounting bracket assembly is provided for the lever. A clamp bar is carried by the lever including a first clamping area for contact ing the belt and clamping the belt against a corresponding second clamping area substantially fixed relative to the mounting bracket. The clamping bar is retained within an open channel and is provided with a centrally located spheri cal dome on its back side to provide point contact with the internal flat surface of the retainer channel on the mounting lever. The point contact assures multi directional rocking or floating movement of the bar when the lever is actuated by a predetermined force on the belt assuring maximum restrain ing action.
