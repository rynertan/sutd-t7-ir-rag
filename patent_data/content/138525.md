# Optical swipe reader housing for use with an identification card.

## Abstract
A concealed code 5 of a card or badge 1 arranged along a line parallel to one edge is read by advancing the card or badge 1 along a slot 22 defined between two internal chambers 34, 36 of a sensor housing 20 that accomodate an infra red light emitting diode 54 and a phototransistor 56 respectively. The two chambers are provided with holes 43, 44 disposed on op posite sides of the slot 22 to facilitate a beam of infra red radia tion passing through the holes 43, 44 and across the slot 22 to read the code 5 embodied in the card or badge 1. The surface at the bottom of the slot 22 slope upwardly from the periphery of the housing to a point of maximum height mid way through the slot 22 that is immediately below the point at which the infra red beam passes across the slot so that the beam reads the code 5 even when the edge of the card 1 is sligthly mis aligned. The code is recorded with successive binary digits represented by transparent windows 10, 12 alternating with regions 11 opaque to infra red radiation, the said windows 10, 12 and opaque regions 11 being arranged along a line parallel to one edge of the card, each window 10, 12 representing a binary digit of the code with one binary digit being represented by first generally rectangular windows 10 of higher transmis sivity and the other binary digit being represented by windows 12 of substantially the same dimensions as the first windows 10 but of lower transmissivity.
