# Production of a nickel steel bar and rod.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a method of producing nickel steel rod or bar of a composition including at least 4 by weight nickel and less than 0.2 by weight carbon. The method comprises cooling a rod or bar of such composi tion on leaving a rolling mill at a rate which is controlled to pro duce in the cooled rod or bar a microstructure which is predo minately martensitic.
