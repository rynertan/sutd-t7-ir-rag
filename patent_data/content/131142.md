# PROCESS FOR RECOVERING A CELL WALL PROTEIN

## Abstract
Process for recovering a cell wall protein, particularly a Fc receptor, from streptococcal bacteria, wherein proteolytic enzymes are used for solubilization of said protein. Papain, trypsin and pepsin, preferably papain, are exam ples of useful proteolytic enzymes for said solubilization. Fc receptor type III protein G having selective IgG binding capability i.e. no albumin binding capability can be reovered from streptococcal bacteria, if these bacteria prior to said enzymatic solubilization are treated with enzymes. For this pretreatment it is preferred to use proteolytic enzymes, among which pepsin and trypsin are the most preferred examples.
