# An alpha amylase assay method and reagent kit.

## Abstract
An α amylase assay method is described together with a reagent kit for use therein. An oligosaccharide substrate for α amylase is provided. The substrate contains at least 3 glucose units. Its reducing end glucose unit is bonded, via a bond cleavable by α or β glucosidase, to a label which exhibits an optically measurable change upon cleavage of the bond. Its terminal glucose unit is bonded to a blocking substituent which inhibits cleavage by exo enzymes of the bond between the terminal glucose unit and the adjacent glucose unit. A liquid assay sample is contacted with the oligosaccharide substrate and with an exo enzyme capable of cleaving the bond between the reducing end glucose unit and the label. The optically measurable change is used as a measure of α amylase in the sample.
