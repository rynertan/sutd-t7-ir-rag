## Description
METHOD FOR CONTROLLING TERMITES Termites are obnoxious pests well known for their insatiable appetite for materials such as wood and wood products. Because of their craving for such materials, termites are directly responsible for the destruction of man made wooden structures such as, for example, buildings, foundations, fence posts, etc. To control the termites, the soil and or the building materials have been treated with materials such as pentachlorophenol, aldrin, chlordane, dieldrin, heptachlor, some arsenic compounds and creosote. However, these substances are highly toxic and are notorious environmental pollutants, and there is a need for less toxic and environmentally less damaging chemical substitutes.Thus, it is quite evident that there is a need for a means for reducing and or preventing the attack on such materials by termites which provides long lasting control while at the same time possessing low acute toxicity towards mammals. The present invention is directed to a method for preventing and or reducing the attack of termites on wood and wood products by contacting said material with an effective amount of a quaternary ammonium salt of a halo substituted 2 and or 4 pyridinol compound. Briefly, in accordance with the present invention, termites are controlled by contacting cellulosic material with an effective amount of one or more active compounds corresponding to the formula EMI2.1 wherein OA is in the 2 or 4 position A represents a quaternary ammonium group, each X independently represents a chlorine, fluorine, bromine or iodine atom and n is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4.Optionally, one or two lower alkyl, e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl groups, may be present on the pyridine nucleus. More particularly, A may be a quaternary ammonium group having the formula NY where Y represents hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl radical having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms wherein the substituents may be halogen or 1 or 2 hydroxyl groups. By the term lower alkyl as used herein is meant straigit or branched chain alkyl grows containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. For convenience, the compounds will be hereinafter referred to as active compounds . The active compounds are applied to the wood and wood products including paper and paper products, which is a food source for the termites, in amounts effective to reduce and or prevent attack of said material by the termites. Of particular interest in the practice of the present invention is a method of controlling termites employing as the active compound the quaternary ammonium salt of 3,5,6 trichloro 2 pyridinol by application to materials such as wood, wood products, paper and paper products. Application of the active compound to the said material can be accomplished by dipping, spraying or painting the material with a composition containing the active compound. The term controlling termites or any variation thereof, is employed to describe the activity of the active compounds of Formula I in reducing and or preventing the attack of termites on the treated material. The specific mechanism by which the active compounds reduce and or prevent the termites from attacking the materials such as wood, wood products, paper and paper products is not known. It appears, however, that the active compounds in some way make these materials unpalatable to the termites. The active compounds of the present invention, useful for controlling termites, can be applied in unmodified form but they are conveniently applied in the form of a liquid or finely divided solid composition containing inert adjuvants or carriers to aid in dispersing the active compounds to treat the materials whereby eventual contact with the termite will be established so that termite control is achieved. In addition, wood rot also is reduced and or prevented by the present treatment. Suitable carriers include water, alcohols, glycols, kerosene, other petroleum distillates and aromatic solvents or convenient combinations of any of these or other suitable carrier systems or solvents. The active compounds can also be dispersed in a finely divided solid and employed as dusts for application to the cellulosic material.The active compounds can also be absorbed into solid carrier clays and employed as granules for application to the material.These solid compositions can also be dispersed in water optionally with the aid of a surfactant and the resulting aqueous suspensions can be applied to the material as a drench or spray. The above emulsifiable concentrates are prepared employing standard well known formulations techniques. For example, the active compounds are mixed with a petroleum distillate, such as xylene an organic solvent, such as dimethylformamide DMF and an emulsifying agent surfactant to form an emulsifiable concentrate, which upon dilution with water forms a suitable aqueous emulsion for application to wood or wood products. The active compounds are preferably applied to the materials which may be subject to attack by termites. The most common applications will be to wood, wood products, paper and paper products. The preferred material is wood. When wood is treated, the active compounds are usually applied to said material as an oil formulation containing organic solvents as the carrier. Suitable organic solvents include kerosene, xylene, toluene and other petroleum distillates. Other organic solvents such as DMF can be added to the oil formulations. A preferred oil formulation would include, for example, 1 to 2 parts by weight active compound, 95 to 97 parts by weight kerosene and 2 to 3 parts by weight DMF. In such applications to wood, the active compounds, in an oil formulation, can be applied by brushing, dipping, spraying, or the like according to known procedures. Usually, the concentration of active compound in the oil formulation is from 0.00001 to 10.0 percent by weight and preferably from 0.1 to 2.0 percent by weight. The oil formulation is applied to the wood in quantities sufficient to thoroughly wet its surface. Alternatively, the active compounds can be applied to wood in a pressure treatment whereby the active compound penetrates deeply into the wood. In one embodiment of the present invention, 3,5,6 trichloro 2 pyridinol or an acceptable salt thereof is brushed onto wood in an oil formulation for controlling termites. In this embodiment, damage by termites to the treated wood is prevented. The exact amount of active compound to be employed when treating the above materials is not critical as long as an amount effective to control termites is retained by the material being treated.The actual amount of the active compound retained by materials such as wood will depend upon a variety of factors such as, for example, type of wood, surface area, moisture content of the wood, density and method of treatment. The optimum amount for an individual application can be readily determined by one skilled in the art employing standard rate titration experiments. The following examples illustrate the practice of the present invention but should not be construed as limiting its scope.Example 1Preparation of 2 Pyridinol 3,5 6 trichloroammonium Salt 59.5 grams 0.3 mol of recrystallized 3,5,6 trichloro 2 pyridinol was suspended in 200 ml of water and an excess of ammonium hydroxide 100 grams was added.
