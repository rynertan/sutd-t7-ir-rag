# Text Processing Terminal with Automatic Text String Input Facility.

## Abstract
A guess ahead feature for a keyboard display terminal where input data is entered via the keyboard and displayed. Means are provided for continually evaluating input data to determine if it is the beginning of a string of data stored in the system memory. If the input data is determined to match the beginning of the string of prestored data, the complete string of stored data is displayed without moving the cursor. An accept key is provided so that if the dis played complete string is the string the terminal operator desires to enter, the terminal operator can, by the depres sing the accept key, advance the cursor to the end of the string. If, however, the displayed string is not exactly as desired, the operator merely continues keying input data.
