## Description
SPACER CLAMP APT TO JOIN TWO GLASS PLATES, USED PARTICULARLY ON CHANDELIERS t This invention relates to a spacer clamp suitable to join two glass plates together and to keep these spaced from each other. The spacer clamp in question is especial ly suited for use on chandeliers or the like. It is known that in the production and assembly of chandeliers and the like, consisting of glass plates, it is necessary to join the plates together and to keep these spaced from each other. The joining of these plates must be simple and practical and the chandeliers must be easy to disassemble and re assemble for routine maintenan ce and cleaning. The spacer clamp according to this invention has been conceived to meet all of the above requirements it can easily be applied to chandeliers and is perfectly apt to permit easy disassembly and reassembling of same. A further characteristic of the spacer clamp according to this invention lies in the fact that it permits joining of the glass plates regardless of whether these lie substantially on the same plane or are set at an angle of any value. The characteristics and advantages afforded by the spacer clamp according to the invention will be evident from the following detailed description of a non limiting embodiment thereof with reference to the annexed drawings in which FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of the spacer clamp according to the invention apt to join substantially co planar glass plates to each other FIGURE 2 is a front view of the spacer clamp, as installed FIGURE 3 is a view of the spacer clamp taken on line Ill Ill of Fig. 2 FIGURE 4 is a perspective view of the spacer clamp according to the invention apt to join two non co planar glass plates FIGURE 5 is a view of the spacer clamp of Fig. 4, as installed FIGURE 6 is a view of the spacer clamp taken on lineVI VI of Fig. 5. Having specific reference to Figs. 1 to 3, the spacer clamp according to the invention, referred to hereinafter simply as a clamp consists essentially of a preferably metal lamina but which may also be made of plastic material said lamina is folded over to form two substantial ly C shaped parts 1 and 2 with their concavities pointing in opposite directions. Moreover, two corresponding branches of said C shaped parts top branches 3 4 ofFig. 1 extend and connect to each other through part 5 extending on a plane substantially parallel to that of said branches 3 4. Lower branches 6 and 7 of the C shaped parts are instead not connected to each other. As shown in the detail in Figs. 1 and 3, the end edges of said parts C 1,2, identified as 8,9 in respect to branches. 3,4 and as 10,11 with respect to branches 6,7 are folded over slightly toward the interior of said C shaped parts so as to exert a certain amount of pressure of said ends on the glass plates to be joined together by the clamps. It is however sufficient that one only of said pairs of end edges, for example, edges 8 and 9, be folded as shown.Edges 10 and 11 may be not folded and may lie on the same plane as branches 6,7 this arrangement is not shown . As illustrated specifically in Fig. 3 the part of portion 5 which overlaps on branches 3 and 4 of the clamp is in contact with said branches. In this way, the configuration of portion 5 plane in this case determines in the first place, the reciprocal position of C shaped parts 1,2 of the clamp and contributes to maintain said parts in said position. With reference to Figs. 4 to 6, also in this case the clamp according to the invention consists of two substantially C shaped parts 1,2 the concavity of which is oriented in opposite directions. Two branches, corresponding to said C shaped elements top branches 3,4 of Fig. 4 extend and connect with each other by means of a portion 5 which is folded centrally along a mid line to form thereby substantially a letter V. In this case also, the parts of portion 5, overlapped on branches 3,4 of C shaped parts 1,2 are in contact with the branches themselves. In this manner, portion 5 determines and contributes to maintain the reciprocal position of the two C shaped parts 1,2 which form, in this case an angle equivalent to the folding angle of portion 5. With specific reference to Figs. 4 and 6, the end edges of C shaped parts 1 and 2, identified as 8,9 for top branches 3 and 4 and as 10,11 for lower branches 6 and , Ã¯ slightly bent toward the interior of saidC shaped parts so as to exert a slight pressure on the glass plates to be joined by the clamp. Also in this case it is sufficient to fold only one pair of end edges, for example, edges 8 and 9 as shown. Edges 10,11 may be not folded and lie on the same plane as branches 6 and 7 this arrangement is not shown . In Figs. 3 and 6 in particular, but also in Figs.2 and 5 it can be seen how the clamp according to the invention is applied to glass plates and how said plates are joined by the clamp. The edges of the glass plates designated by numbers 12 and 13 are provided with linings 14 and 15 respectively, made, for example, of plastic material which is substantially secured to said plates and extends over the entire contour of same. The clamp according to the invention as shown in Figs.2 and 5 and Figs. 3 and 6, is applied on said linings 14 and 15 but it is evident that the lining may not be applied, in which case the clamp would be applied directly to the bare edges of the glass plates. As it can be seen in more detail in Figs. 3 and 6 the two C shaped parts forming the clamp according to the invention are forced lightly onto the edges of the glass plates, in particular on their linings 14 and 15. For this purpose, the distance between the branches of said C shaped parts will be slightly less with respect to the overall thickness of glass plates 12,13 and their respective linings 14,15 so that when said plates are introduced in the C shaped parts, the branches of these will devaricate to a slight extent and set themselves in the position shown in Figs. 3 and 6, in which it is seen that said branches, in particular their edges 8,9 and 10,11, exert a pressure on the linings of the glass plates.Furthermore, the length of branches 3,4 and 6,7 is greater than the length of sides 14a and 15a of linings 14,15 so that said C shaped parts 1,2 completely embrace said linings 14,15. Once the clamp is applied to the glass plates, the latter will be spaced from each other by a distance equal to the distance between C shaped parts 1,2 as the latter are not near to each other but located at a certain distance from each other, regardless of whether portion 5 is rectilinear or V shaped. The material preferably metal but also plastic for the clamp according to this invention must have a certain elasticity to permit a limited degree of deformation of portion 5, thereby to provide a clamp having a substantial ly elastic body. It is evident that in case portion 5 is substantiallyV shaped the value of the angle of said V is not to be considered binding. It is understood, lastly, that variants and or m,odificationsay be introduced in the spacer clamp accord ing to his invention, without exceeding from the protecti ve scope of the invention.
