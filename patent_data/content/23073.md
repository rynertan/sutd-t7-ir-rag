# Segmented magnet dynamoelectric machine with series connected rotor conductors.

## Abstract
A dynamoelectric machine with a circumferentially segmented stationary magnetic field structure 10 providing magnetic poles N1 N4 S1 S4 including diametrically opposed pairs of north and south poles N1, N4 and S2, S3 , with intervening poles of alternating polarity, rotor conductors 36 extending longitudinally and selectively interconnected in sets providing a plurality of series current paths each traversing a plurality of stator active pole regions 26 , and a pair of brushes for current collection at one or both machine ends.
