# Method for forming a transistor, and transistor.

## Abstract
A transistor is provided which includes an electrical con tact 122 formed in a V shaped groove 118 . Because of the unique shape of the electrical contact, a smaller surface area is required for its formation thus rendering it possible to con struct a transistor having a smaller surface area. The groove is formed by anisotropically etching an expitaxial layer 102 on a semi conductor substrate 100 using, for example KOH.
