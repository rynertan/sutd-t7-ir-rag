# LIQUID CRYSTALLINE COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
Disclosed are liquid crystal copolyesters prepared from p hydroxybenzoic acid, isophthalic and or terephthalic acid, hydroquinone and a mono substituted hydroquinone wherein the substituent is selected from the group consisting of alkyls of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, phenyl and phenyl substituted with an alkyl to 1 to 6 carbon atoms, chloro, bromo, cyano, formyl, acetyl, and trifluoromethyl, wherein, when a specific amount of the hydroquinone is replaced by a specific substituted hydroquinone, the copolyester not only becomes more tractable but also unexpectedly more crystal line when compared to the unsubstituted copolyester.
