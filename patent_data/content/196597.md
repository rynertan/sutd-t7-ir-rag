## Description
This invention relates to processes for treating ammonium nitrate containing waste water. In recent years, it has become important from the viewpoint of water quality control to remove nitrogen components particularly ammonia nitrogen as well as chemically oxidizable substances hereinafter referred to as COD components from waste water. We conducted extensive research for a long time on processes for treating ammonia containing waste water and developed processes for treating ammonia containing waste water with ease and with economical feasibility the processes comprise in general subjecting waste water to wet oxidation in the presence of a specific catalyst and under specified conditions namely processes disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent Publications Nos. 19757 1984 corresponding to US A 4141 828 42992 1981 42391 1982 27999 1983 33320 1982, etc. . With greater weight recently attached to nuclear power generation in power generating industry, one of important technological problems before us is the treatment of NH₄NO₃ containing waste water from the processing of uranium ores and reprocessing of the used uranium fuel. We attempted to treat such NH₄NO₃ containing waste water by adapting the foregoing processes for treating ammonia containing waste water hereinafter referred to as prior processes and found that the prior processes achieve the decomposition of NH₄ ion with a high efficiency but the decomposition of NO₃ ion with an efficiency not invariably satisfactory. This drawback is presumably caused by the presence of NH₄NO₃ in a concentration as high as about 1 10,000 ppm to about 10 100,000 ppm . To overcome the foregoing drawback, we carried out further research and discovered that NO₃ ion as well as NH₄ ion is efficiently decomposed when subjecting NH₄NO₃ containing waste water to wet thermal decomposition substantially in the absence of oxygen or in the presence of oxygen in less than the theoretical amount required for the decomposition of the ammonia components, organic substances and inorganic substances present in the waste water instead of subjecting the waste water to the prior processes in which the wet oxidation of waste water is effected using oxygen in more than the theoretical amount required for the decomposition of the ammonia components, organic substances and inorganic substances contained in the waste water. E.g. US A 4141 828 discloses that generally the the oxygen containing gas is fed in an amount of 1 to 1.5 times, preferrably 1.05 to 1.2 times the theoretical amount of oxygen for treating ammonia containing waste water which further contains only 300 ppm of nitrite nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen. Our continued research demonstrated that when subjecting to the wet thermal decomposition in the presence of oxygen in less than the theoretical amount NH₄NO₃ containing waste water having incorporated therein ammonia in a mole ratio of 1 NH₃ N NO₃ N 5 which mole ratio means the ratio of the total moles of nitrogen in the forms of NH₄ and NH₃ per moles of nitrogen in the form of NO₃ , the decomposition of components is achieved with a further improved efficiency. Through our more investigations we also found that when subjecting to the wet thermal decomposition in the presence of oxygen in less than the theoretical amount NH₄NO₃ containing waste water having incorporated therein not more than 1 mole of COD component per mole of NO₃ ion, the NH₄ and NO₃ ions decompose with a high efficiency and that when subjecting to the wet thermal decomposition in the presence of oxygen in less than the theoretical amount NH₄NO₃ containing waste water having incorporated therein ammonia in a mole ratio of 1 NH₃ N NO₃ N 5 and not more than 1 mole of COD component per mole of NO₃ ion, the NH₄ and NO₃ ions decompose with a higher efficiency. More specifically, this invention provides five kinds of processes for treating waste water. Throughout the specification and the appended claims, the term theoretical amount used in respect of oxygen means theoretical amount required for the decomposition of the ammonia, organic substances and inorganic substances present in the waste water to N₂, H₂O and CO₂, and the term NH₃ N and the term NO₃ N refer to ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen , respectively. The waste waters which can be treated by the processes of this invention include all kinds of waste waters containing NH₄NO₃ in a concentration of 1 to 10 or more. The waste waters to be treated by the processes of the invention may contain both organic and inorganic substances. The processes of the invention achieve a high efficency when carried out at a pH of 3 to 11.5, preferably 5 to 11. Therefore, when required, the pH of the waste water may be suitably adjusted with an alkali substance such as sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, calcium hydroxide, etc. Examples of active components of catalysts which can be used in this invention are ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, platinum and gold, and the compounds thereof insoluble or sparingly soluble in water. These active components can be used singly or at least two of them are usable in mixture. Examples of useful compounds which are insoluble or sparingly soluble in water are ruthenium dichloride, platinum dichloride, ruthenium sulfide, rhodium sulfide, etc. These active components of catalysts are used as supported in a conventional manner by a carrier such as titania, zirconia, alumina, silica, alumina silica, active carbon, and porous bodies of metals such as nickel, nickel chromium, nickel chromium aluminum, nickel chrominum iron and the like. The amount of the active components to be supported by the carrier ranges from about 0.05 to about 25 , preferably about 0.5 to about 3 , based on the weight of the carrier. The catalyst can be used in the form of globules, pellets, cylinders, crushed fragments, particles or in any other desired form. When the reaction column used has a fixed bed, the waste water is passed therethrough preferably at a space velocity of about 0.5 to about 10 1 hr, preferably about 1 to about 5 1 hr, based on an empty column. The grains or pieces of the supported catalyst useful for the fixed bed are usually about 3 to about 50 mm, preferably about 5 to about 25 mm in size. In the case of the fluidized bed, it is preferable to use the supported catalyst as suspended in the waste water like a slurry in such an amount that it will form a fluidized bed within the reactor, namely in an amount of usually about 0.5 to about 20 by weight, preferably about 0.5 to about 10 by weight, based on the resulting suspension. For the actual operation with the fluidized bed, it is preferred to feed the supported catalyst to the reactor as suspended in the waste water like a slurry, separate the the catalyst from the treated water resulting from the reaction by sedimentation, centrifuging or like suitable method and reuse the separated catalyst again. To facilitate the separation of the catalyst from the treated water, therefore, the supported catalyst useful for the the fluidized bed is advantageously about 0.15 to about 0.5 mm in particle size. When the process of this invention is conducted in the presence of oxygen in less than the theoretical amount, various gases can be used as the oxygen source. Examples of gases useful in this invention are air, oxygen enriched air, oxygen, oxygen containing waste gases containing as impurities one or more of hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, sulfur oxide, organic sulfur compounds, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, etc. The feed rate of the oxygen containing gases is determinable from the theoretical amount of oxygen required for the decomposition of the ammonia, organic substances and inorganic substances contained in the waste waste. Generally the gas is fed in an amount of about 0.2 to 0.6 time the theoretical amount of the oxygen present in the reaction system. When the oxygen containing waste gases are used as the oxygen source, the harmful components of the gas can be rendered harmless along with the those contained in the waste water. The oxygen containing gas may be fed to the reactor at a single level or in two or more levels. The reaction is carried out at a temperature of usually about 100 to about 370 C, preferably about 200 to about 300 C. The higher the reaction temperature, the higher the efficiency of removal of NH₄ ion and NO₃ ion and the shorter the residence time of the waste water within the reactor but the higher the equipment cost. Accordingly the reaction temperature is determined in view of the kind of the waste water, the degree of desired treatment and operation and equipment costs combined. The reaction pressure therefore needs only to be such that the waste water can at least retain its liquid phase at the predetermined temperature. When subjecting to wet thermal decomposition the NH₄NO₃ containing waste water having incorporated therein ammonia in a mole ratio of 1 NH₃ N NO₃ N 5, the reaction is conducted under the same conditions as above. When subjecting to wet thermal decomposition the NH₄NO₃ containing waste water having incorporated therein not more than 1 mole of COD component per mole of NO₃ ion, the reaction conditions are the same as those stated above. Preferred amount of COD component to be added is about 0.1 to about 0.5 mole per mole of NO₃ ion contained in the waste water. When subjecting to wet thermal decomposition the NH₄NO₃ containing waste water having incorporated therein COD component and ammonia, the amount of COD component to be present is the same as above, and the amount of ammonia to be incorporated is in a mole ratio of 1 NH₃ N NO₃ N 5. The reaction conditions in this case are also the same as above. Examples of sources of COD components and ammonia to be incorporated in the waste water include a wide variety of waste water containing these substances such as gas liquors produced in coke oven plants, coal gasifying plants and coal liquefying plants, waste water from gas cleaning processes employed in these plants, waste water from desulfurization process and from cyanide removal process, oil containing waste water, waste water from activated sludge process, sedimented acitivated sludge, waste water from chemical plants and oil refineries, municipal effluents, sewage, sewage sludge, etc. This means that the processes of this invention can treat these waste waters, together with the ammonium nitrate containing waste water. The processes of this invention are capable of treating waste water containing NH₄NO₃ in a high concentration with an improved efficiency and reducing the concentration of NH₄ ion and NO₃ ion to a considerable extent. With this advantage, the processes of the invention can easily treat waste water from the processing of uranium ore into nuclear fuel and reprocessing of the used uranium fuel with use of simple equipment which water may contain NH₄NO₃ in a concentration of 10 or more. The present invention will be described below in greater detail with reference to the following Examples and Comparison Examples.
