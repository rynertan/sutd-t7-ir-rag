# Varying loudspeaker spatial characteristics.

## Abstract
A loudspeaker system having two angled rear panel with four drivers on each rear panel and a single driver on the front panel has the drivers connected in series between first and second terminals and a third terminal connected to the junction of the front driver and one of the banks of series connected rear drivers. First and second power amplifiers are connected between the third terminal and the first and second terminals, respectively. A potentiometer is connected bet ween the inputs of the first and second power amplifiers with the potentiometer arm coupled to the third terminal through a capacitor.
