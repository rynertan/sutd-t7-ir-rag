# A flowmeter.

## Abstract
A flowmeter having an elongate probe 2 is insertable into a stream of fluid flowing within a pipe 4 to extend across the stream. The probe 2 includes an internal chamber 10 to extend across the stream, an upstream facing surface 12 against which the said flowing fluid can impinge, and a plurality of impact ports 14 extending through said upstream facing surface to the internal cham ber 10 . These impact ports 14 are spaced along said upstream facing surface 12 to sense the impact pressure of the fluid at different transverse points across the pipe 4 . The impact ports 14 are dimensioned to restrict flow within the chamber 10 so that the pressure within the chamber 10 represents the average impact pressure across the flow profile. A first conduit 18 leads from the chamber 10 to the high pressure port 20 of means for measuring differential pressure, and a second conduit 22 leads from the flow pipe wall downstream of the probe 2 to the low pressure port 24 of the differential pressure measuring device.
