# Method of producing semiconductor devices comprising an overlying polysilicon layer.

## Abstract
A method of fabricating semiconductor devices and a semiconductor device so made in which a polysilicon layer 18 overlies an insulating layer 16 and a substrate 14 . A nitride layer 20 covers the polysilicon layer 18 and then a reverse tone load implant mask 22 and an etching process open an area 24 which is then boron implanted. An oxide 32 is then grown on the boron doped region 30 only, thereby thinning the poly in that region. After the nitride has been stripped, the polysilicon layer 18 is doped, the oxide 32 shielding the boron doped region 34 from further substantial doping. Next, the poly definition photoresist mask 38 is applied and the ex posed oxide 32 and polysilicon 18, 36 is etched to define po ly lines 12 each having boron doped resistor 10, 34 therein. The difference in etch rates between the heavily doped poly regions 36 and the lightly doped poly regions 34 is compen sated for by the adjustement of thickness of the boron doped regions 34 . Hence, the etch for both types of poly concludes at about the same time, leaving the underlying layers substan tially intact. Sources and drains may be implanted thereafter without an additional load implant mask.
