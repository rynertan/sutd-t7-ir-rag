# REMOTE METER READING

## Abstract
The readings of electricity meters are conveyed to a substation from a customer s premises over the mains wiring. The data is transmitted on the circuit between the mains neutral wire and ground, the transceivers at the two ends being transformer coupled to the neutral image. Transmission uses frequency hopping spread spectrum techniques, with each customer allocated a couple of blocks of frequencies, one for bit 0 and one for bit 1. At each data transmission samples are made for voltage once and current three times , with the samples digitized, and than modulated on to the spread spectrum frequency hopping system.
