# Heat control apparatus.

## Abstract
An automatic heat control apparatus for use with an electric heating element 6 in a kiln 4 or the like com prises a first power controller 12 having a plurality of on and off intervals. The first controller 12 supplies electric current to the kiln 4 heating element 6 during its on intervals, and further includes means 18 for adjusting the duration of the on intervals relative to the off intervals. A constant speed electric motor 20 is mechanically cou pled to the first power controller 12 for gradually increas ing the duration of the on intervals and decreasing the dura tion of the off intervals such control ensures that the tem perature inside the kiln 4 increases very gradually to les sen the risk of breaking the ceramic material being fired. Furthermore, the average speed of the motor 20 may be controlled by means of a second power controller 36 , similar to the first controller 12 , having a plurality of on and off intervals which intermittently energize the motor 20 for rotation thereof. By adjusting the duration of the on interval relative to the off intervals of the second control ler, the average speed of rotation of the motor 20 may be selectively varied to control the rate of increase in the dura tion of the on interval in the first controller 12 .
