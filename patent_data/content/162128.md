# Paper tape rewinding device.

## Abstract
The device includes a spool 24 and a mounting struc ture 20, 28, 96, 98 for mounting the spool on a machine which uses paper tape. The mounting structure rotatably mounts the spool in a manner that the spool can rest on the paper tape roll of the machine and includes elements 40,97 which rest against the back of the machine. The mounting structure is adjustable so that the axis of rotation of the spool is dis posed between the axis of rotation of the paper tape roll and the surface of the machine such that the spool and the mount ing structure are wedged between the surface of the machine and the roll.
