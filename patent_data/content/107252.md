## Abstract
A semiconductor device having a planar pn junction 2 between a more highly doped first region 4 and a more weak ly doped second region 5 of the opposite conductivity type, a narrow strip shaped conductive layer 9 used as a field plate being present above this junction 2 , which layer has substan tially the same potential as the first region 4 and an edge 7 which substantially coincides with the pn junction 2 . According to the invention, the conductive layer 9 local ly comprises a widened part 14 suitable for contacting pur poses, which, in order to avoid breakdown, is constituted by a protuberance of the said edge 7 towards the first region 4 . The invention is of particular importance in DMOS transis tor structures, in which the said field plate is connected to the gate electrode.
