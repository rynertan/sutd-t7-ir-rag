# Nozzle assembly for die casting machine.

## Abstract
A nozzle 22 for a die casting machine of the type having mould halves 14 that move toward and away from a parting line and engage a nozzle located on the parting line. The nozzle is free to float a limited amount on its surface mounting so as to assume a correct location at every shot in response to the die inserts 18, 20 closing around it. The nozzle also has a frusto conical surface 30 on the exit end of its aperture to provide a clean breakaway after a shot is made. Only a small contact area is provided on the nozzle for engagement by the moulds to reduce heat transfer thereto from the nozzle, and moreover the structure increases specific superficial pressure between the nozzle area and the mould insert area in order to crush any metal debris that accumulates during the casting operation.
