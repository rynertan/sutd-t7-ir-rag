# Apparatus for introducing substances into liquids e.g. metal melts.

## Abstract
For introducing gases, wires and powders to metal melts, a multi ducted refractory body 11 is installed in the wall 14 of a vessel 15 for the melt. The body has passage closing elements 24, 34, 35 preventing melt entering the passages A, B, C . Two passages A and C serve respective ly for introducing gas, and fluidised powders, to the melt each has a movable pipe 36, 91 for gas or fluidised powder . Upon moving gas pipe 36 towards the melt, it dislodges closing element 24 whereby gas from the pipe can enter the melt via capillary bores 25 . Similarly, by moving pipe 91 , closing element 35 is dislodged whereby the fluidised powder can discharge trom the pipe 91 . Wire is fed along passage B to the melt when it reaches the closing element 34 the wire can itself dislodge this eiement to gain access to the melt. A method of introducing substances to liquids related to use of this apparatus is disclosed, as well as metallurgical processes involving the method.
