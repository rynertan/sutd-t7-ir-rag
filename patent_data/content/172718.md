# Tapping attachment and drive train thereof.

## Abstract
An automatic tapping attachment has a drive spindle disposed therein for transmitting rotational movement to a tapping bit. The tapping attachment has a driver which transmits rotational movement to the spindle by means of a ball and slot structure on the spindle. The balls and slots are circumferentially positioned in the outer surface of the spindle and are preferably equiangular from each other. Preferably three axially aligned springs positioned in grooves on the outer surface of the spindle on each axial of the balls. The springs are in contact with one of a pair of rings and impart axial biasing force to the balls. Each ring is positioned on one side of the balls. The ball and slot structure provides rotational drive engagement to the spin dle in both direct and reverse drive. A spring axially mounted between the spindle and the driver member permits axial movement of the spindle relative to the driver member. The springs are angularly positioned in order to provide circum ferentially uniform distribution of biasing force on the balls.
