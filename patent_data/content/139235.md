# Ultrasonic measurement method and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus wherein two probes are arranged to oppose each other on either side of an object under investigation and each of two probes emits ultrasonic waves to measure the acoustic characteristics of the object respectively. Mean attenuation coefficients for small intervals can be calculated solely from the received echo signals by proces sing signals indicative of echos of the ultrasonic waves from the two probes. Reflection coefficient can be calculated from the mean attenuation coefficients obtained. In addition, distribution image of either of the mean attenuation coeffi cient and reflection coefficient distributions are obtained from these mean attenuation coefficients and reflection coefficients for the small intervals.
