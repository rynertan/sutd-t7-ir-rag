# Method of forming a number of solder portions on a semiconductor wafer.

## Abstract
A method of forming a number of discrete solder layers 9 on a semiconductor wafer 1 of a large area. A number of regions 2 which are easy to be wetted with solder are formed on one of the major surfaces of the wafer 1 . A solder foil 6 is positioned on the one major surface and a plate like jig 7 including a plate and projections 71 formed on one surface thereof is disposed on the solder foil 6 with the projections 71 facing the latter. By heating the stacked assembly at a sufficiently high temperature for the solder foil 6 to be molten, a number of the discrete solder layers 9 having a uniform thickness are formed on the semiconductor wafer 1 .
