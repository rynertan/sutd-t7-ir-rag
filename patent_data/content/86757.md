Mucolytic mucoregolating activityIt is knon that the liquefying of excreta by chemical means constitutes a fundamental therapeutic objective in the modern therapy regarding obstructive, chronic bronchopneumonopathics. Since the bronchial secretion generally consists of purulent exudates and mucous the exudates being DRA rich and the mucous mucoprotein rich, the chemical products used up to now as liquefiers have been enzymes, surfactants and sulfurated compounds. he enzymes and surfactants are not, however, consistent in their effectiveness and are not well tolerated, giving rise to allergies, bronchial asthma attacks and irritation of the mucous membranes. The sulfurated compounds are the most interesting zucolytics today, especially L cysteine and some of its derivatives. Because of the instability of natural aminoacids in solution, the offensive level of the odor and the short activity period due to rapid metabolizing, the derivatives are preferred over the L cysteine.The common characteristic of all these sulfurated compounds is the presence of the SH groups, which are essential for providing the mucolytic action. In fact, the protection of this group by acetylation or its oxidation to disulfide makes the mucolytic activity disappear Sheffner A.L., The reduction in vitro in viscosityoof mucoprotein solutions by a new mucolytic agent, N acetyl L cysteine. Ann. N,P, Acad.Sci., 106, 298 1963 .The mechanism of the mucolytic action for the b cysteine derivatives both t vitro and for local application by means of instillation or aerosol therapy seems to derive from a this diasfide interaction with a breaking of the intramolecular cysteinic disulfide bridges of the mucoprotein with consequent reduction of the mucoprotein. When these pharmaceutical products are administered orally or parenterally, there seems to be, instead, a regulating effect on the cellular metabolism and, in particular, on the enzymatic activity, as well as on the oxidizing reducer processes of the respiratory chain and on the permeability of the membranes at the bronchial level where the thiolic compounds tend to accumulate.These latter properties are more mucoregulatory than mucolytic and are accentuated in carboxymethylated cysteine at the thiolic group, which is almost without mucolytic activity in vitro but active in vivo and better tolerated than the derivatives of cysteine with free thiol. During aerosol therapy, in fact, these derivatives free small quantities of sulfurated hydrogen which have an intense local irritating action with consequent manifestations of broncospasm and hypersecretion of tracheobronchial fluid, giving rise to a feeling of suffocation, nausea and vomiting. They are also often irritating to the gastric mucous, when administered orally or parenterally, with eructation having a nauseating taste and odor of mercaptan. Bernstein I.L., Ausdenmoore R.W., Iatrogenic bronchospasm occurring during clinical trials of a new mucolytic agent, acetylcysteine.Dis. Chest. 46, 469 1964 .S carboxymethyl cysteine, instead, is suitable for oral administration and has no irritative action because it does not oxidize when exposed to the air. It does not act before being converted to a thiolic compound followed by the thioldisulfide interaction, but modifies the composition of the bronchial mucosa, diminishing the fucus rich, neutral glycopep tides hydrophobics and augmenting the hydrophile sialoglycopeptides.The new compounds with the thiolic group protected by superior fatty acid esterification, object of this invention, quite unexpectedly displayed tolerability ara mucolytic and inuco regulatory activity characteristics that were even superior to those shown by S carboxymethyl cysteine, ore precisely, the advantages determined for these new compounds with respect to the thiolic derivatives with known techniques can be stated as follows 1 Gradual activity with reduced local irritetion due to the absence of free thiolic groups and to the impossibility of the for of rapidly biodegradable cysteine essential difference from S carosymethylcysteine .2 Greater absorbability, due to the superior liposolubility and transmucosal penetrability, with high tolerability at the bronchial mucous level and alveolar epithelium of te bronchi due to the affinity which exists particularly with the almitic esters with the pulmonary surfactant dipalmit oyl lecithin which is responsible for maintaining alveolar stability and pulmonary exparcability. The new derivatives of mercaptopropionamidoacetic acid underwent in vitro tests based directly on viscosimetric variations of the bronchial excreta and or gastric mucin of swine. The results shows almost complete lack of activity, as was to be expected since there were no free thiolic groups.The in vitro tests, however, were performed on the excreta of patients with bronchial hypersecretion, administering the esters orally 30 and 50 mg kg die, respectively for a period of one week, with the result that these new compounds proved effective in modifying the mucin constituents of the fibrillar reticulum. Analysis of the glycopeptides of the bronchial mucus which were obtained by means o hydrolysis with papain 24 hours at 370 and pH 65 and then with pronase 24 hours at 370 and pR 7.3 and fractioned by electrophoresis on agar ose at pH 8.6 followed by chromatographic analysis on column DAE Sephadex A 25 in fact demonstrated an average increase of sialoglycopeptides hydrophile of almost 90 and a reduction of over 55 of the weakly acid glycopeptides and neutral mucin hydrophobic with consequent diminution of te viscosl ty. Comparative tests with S carboxymethylcysteine at higher doses 70 mg kg die showed an average increase in sialoglyco peptides that did not exceed 75 and a diminution of glycopep tides and mucin that did not exceed 45 .Even in vivo the mucolytic and mucoregulating activity of the new compounds proved intense, in tests which evaluated the bronchial hypersecretion induced in rats with So2 after having administrated the esters orally at the rate of 0.5 g kg die for two weeks. The inhalation of 300 ppm of SO2 for two hours per day, for a total period of 90 hours, produced bronchial obstruction in only 12 of the animals compared to the 80 produced in those not treated.Under the same test conditions, using the same dose of 0.5 g kg die of S carboxymethylcysteine, the per cent of animals not protected was 25 .Histological and histochemical P.A.S. coloration tests, furthermore, showed that the bronchial mucosa of the rats treated with the new compounds had a considerable significant reduction about 35 less of the calyciform hyperplasia and the number of muciparous cefls, with the almost complete persistence of the SH groups in the cells of the bronchial mucosa otherwise reduced by about 70 by the SO2. These results can be attributed to a cytotrophic protective action. inally, with the rats which underwent C nebulization treatment for 10 days 5 applications, 2.minutes per day , the contemporaneous oral administration of the esters of this invention, at doses of 0.5 g kg die, prevented intrabronchial desquamation and reactive hyperplasia of the mucosa to the extent of 60 . Under the same test conditions, with the same doses, S carboxymethylcysteine produced prevention to an extent which did not exceed 40 .These results also attest to the new compounds capability of producing trophic protective action.The anti inflammatory activity of the new compounds was also determined becaust of the importance of phlogosis to bronchospasmic processes.The anti inflammatory activity was investigated on rats bg administering the new products, orally, using an esophagal probe. One hour after administration, a subcutaneous injection of 0.05 ml of 1 carragenin was made in the right hind paw and three hours later a plethysmometric evaluation was made of the difference in volume between the two hind paws WINTER C.A., RISLEY E.A., NUSS G.W., Carragenin inducad edema in hind paw of the rat as an assay for anti inflamma tory drugs. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 111, 544 1962 .The DE50of the new products proved to be about 1 g kg while that of S carboxymethylcysteine was not determinable. By way of comparison, we would say that the DE50 of a classic antiphlogistic, such as acetylsalicylic acid, is 100 mg kg. The esters with which this invention is concerned, therefore, have an antiphlogistic capability which is able to inhibit plasmatic quinines which consequentially favors the reduction of bronchospasm in obstructive and hypersecretive bronchopneumonopathics.The antibronchospastic activity of the new compounds, in fact, was evaluated by pretreating test animals with 2 g kg of the new compounds, administered by way of an esophagal probe, ai j then submitting them to aerosol histaminic shock histamine phosphate 1 80 at about 140 mm Eg . The time was noted between when the aerosol was given and the convulsions began.After two hours of pretreatement, times amounting to 70 of the approximately 1cO seconds of the control group were obtailed. Induction times proved even greater by 20 after 48 hours. With S carboxymethylcysteine there was no appreciable difference between the control and tested subjects.The new compounds, therefore, provide intense and persistent protection against bronchspasm induced experimentally with histamine, in strict correlation with the anti inflammatory activity reported previously.All the in vivo tests described above demonstrate that these new compounds have an intense mucoregulation activity and cytotrophic protective activity on the bronchial mucosa and also have anti inflammatory and antibronchospasmic effectiveness which is superior to that of S carboxymethylcysteine. Furthermore, they diminish hypersecretion and phiogosis, which is experimentally induced, thus reequilibrating the glycopeptide fractions of the fibrillar mucin and modifying the rheological quality of the pathological mucous which, after oral treatment, becomes less viscous without, however, becoming too fluid, as instead happens after treatment with thiolic compounds.Preliminary clinical tests on chronic bronchitis cases , where the new compounds were administered orally 3 g or rectally 0,9 g , these amounts daily for at least a week, showed a gradual reduction of viscosity of the exoreta an average of 70 for purulent expectoration and 50 for mucopurulent expectoration 4 5 days after the beginning of treatment evaluation was made with a rotary, cone and plate viscosimeter , and an increase in vital capacity of 20 , an increase of 15 in Vh5E and a residual volume reduction of about 2O. The new compounds can also be administered using aerosol, dispersed from 5 10 in n 0.15 M sodium chloride solution. The aerosol action is produced by an ultrasonic ttnit at37 C,The particles produced are subaLcronic 0.1 Q.6 micron , very stable, and are able to assure the penetration of other pharmaceutical products, such as chemio antibiotics, into the pumonary alveoli.The administration by aerosol did not reveal any quinic action of the kallikrein on the bronchial tone In other words, no bronchospasmic manifestations were noted evaluated by means of plethysmograph with broncholabile patients This test also demonstrates the good level of tolerability of their new compounds in comparison to the free thiolic compounds.2. Hepatotrophic disintoxicating activityAster the treatment described in the preceding paragraph where CCl4 was used a treatment which notoriously provokes hepatic alterations which are similar to those produced by viral hepatitis liver examinations were made. It was unexpectedly found that the new products had produced a very strong anti toxichepato protective action. In fact, it was seen that, in these rats, the weight of the liver represented only 4 of the total body weight. When the liver checks were made, the weight of the liver constituted about 6 of the total body weight, which shows that the new compounds impede the increase of weight of the hepatic parenchyma induced by the lesioning action of the i4 on the liver. Macroscopic examination confirmed these results.The livers of the animals in the control group were greatly increased in size, pale in color, with increased consistency but fragile and with a microgranulous surface. The treated animals presented a much better picture, being practically normal. The histological examination showed the control animals as having the classical alterations induced by the hepatotoxin cytoplasmatic vacuolation, hepatocyte volume at least tripled, albuminoid degeneration and notably proliferated, fatty connective tissue with the formation of pseudolobes . In the treated animals, it was evident that the damage to the liver had been normalized hepatocytes practically normal in size, with microvacuolation often with two nuclei demonstrating an active repair process, and slight connective tissue proliferation.Finally, while the livers of the control animals had a proteinic reduction of about 25 , those of the treated animals had a reduction of about 10 . Likewise, while there was an increase of 75 in the lipids content with.the control group, it did not exceed 21 in the treated animals.It is quite obvious that the hepatoprotective action demonstrated by the new compounds is due to its capability of inhibiting lipoperoxidation. Assuming that the demolition of p oxyphenylpyruvic acid is valid as a measure of the oxidative capacity of the hepatic microsomes, it is a significant fact that the increase in its urinary elimination from 10 to 20 of the dose administered 35 mg kg per os at the 10th day of intoxication in the same rats which were exposed to CCl4 inhalation is still not greater than 13 of the animals treated with the new compounds.These surprizing results with CCl4 intoxication which bring about modifications similar to those clinically observable in viral hepatitis cases led to furthest hepatopathic ex periments on rats using thioacetamide, which produces death in a way similar to that resulting from cirrhosis. The thioacetamide was given orally in doses of 185 mg kg die, while the new compounds were given orally in the same doses s in the previous tests 0.5 g kg die. The contemporaneous treatment with the new compounds extended the survival period from 74 to 109 days, which amounts to about 47 .A third experimental hepatopathic condition, characterized by hepatic necrosi and steatitis, was induced in rats by means of a single i.p. dose of etionine 0.4 g kg , which normally causes the hepatic triglycerides to increase from 1 mg g of liver weight to 4,5 mg g, an increase of ore than 400 . retreatment with the new compounds, giving oral doses of 0.5 s kg die, kept the increase to less than 200 .Finally, with the hepatic steatitis cases the rats being given the usual 0.5 g kg die does of the new compounds, oral ly, and kept on a Handler steatogenous diet after 28 days the retarding of the clearance of the BSF bronchosulfonphtha lene , which is an index of how much the liver function has been compromised, was observed to be 23, less than that of the animals which were only given steatogenous diet. After 30 minutes from the BSF e.v. injection, the hematic of centrations averaged 5.6 versus 7.3 of the control group. All the above tests prove that the new compounds exert a definite hepatrophic disintoxicating action which is, in a general senses aspecific and polyvalent. Clinically, preliminary tests were performed with the new compounds on a limited and differentiated group of test animals having, for the most part, acute hepatitis, which was chronic and persistent and due to various causes, aggressive chronic hepatitis cases, compensated cirrhosis cases, all being given 3 g orally or 0.9 g rectally of the new compounds. The results were that, in addition to an improvement of the clinical symptomatology asthenia, anorexia, nausea, dispepsia, epigastric heaviness and hepatomegaly , there was a decided recovery of the hematochemical cytolysis indexes, of the hepatocytic function and of the intrahepatic cholostasis, with very good local and system tolerabilsty. 3. Anti ertensive activity The antihypertensive activity of the new products was checked with induced hypertension using angiotensin I.When rabbits with normal pressure were administered 0.5 v kg die of the new compounds for 10 days and then infected endovenously with 310 mg kg of angiotensin I, their average arterial pressure went up not more, than 5 . The non pretreated animals had, instead, a pressure increase of 20 . The preliminary clinical tests performed with the new compounds, administerIng 3 g orally and Q.9 g rectally per day for a period of from two to three weeks on subjects affected with essential arterial hypertension, demonstrated the new compounds ability to reduce the arterial pressure independently of the basic values of the plasma tic renin activity. This reduction ability was enough to lead us to presume that the new compounds act with alternate mechanisms which block the production of angiotensin II.Also in this case, even with the long treatment, a very unexpected and perfect tolerability was observed. As is known, thiolic products ar often responsible for the reduction and alteration of the gustatory sensitivity, as well as cutaneous itching and rash, when the therapy is protracted.4. ToxicologyThe new compounds have proved to have an extremely low level of acute toxicity. In fact, while S carboxymethylcysteine has a DL50 of 5.18 g kg, the new thiolic esters DL50 cannot be determined, i.p., since more than 5 g kg cannot be admin istered but, orally, the DL50 is above 8 g kg, as with theS earboymethylcysteine, The subacute, chronic and fetal tosi city was evaluated by mixing the esters with the food.The subacute toxicity in rats was tested for 12 weeks the chronic toxicity was tested in rats and dogs for six months at 0.1 to 0.9 g kg die the fetal toxicity was tested in rats 0.3 to 0.9 g kg die from the 6th to 16th day of gravidity and in rabbits 0.1 to 0.3 g kg die from the 6th to 18th day of gravidity . All tests demonstrated very good tolerability to the new compounds.In fact, no significant variance wos observed in body weight, in the macro and microscopic aspects of the main organs, in the hemochromocytometric examinations, in the hepatic func tional tests bilirubin, SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphates , nor as regards uricemia, cholesterolemia, glycemia, azotemia and the standard urine tests.The treatment, furthermore, had no negative effects on the mothers, nor on the characteris tics of the offspring as regards the number born, fetal loss es and weights of offspring and fetuses, nor as regards embryonic d fetal development, on the basis of the number of malformations, variations or anomalies involving the skeleton or viscere In order to evaluate the tolerability at the lung level, for the same rats undergoing the chronic tonicity test, a determination of the influence made at the surfactant level was done at the termination of the treatment. . phospholipids analysis was made, obtaining qualitative data by means of LC chromographic analysis and quantitative data by phosporous determination. Gas chromographic analysis was made of the fatty acid content in liposomes separated by centrifug ing from the liquid in which the excised lungs had b on washed. No significant differences were observed as compared with the control group.Idkewise, no significant differences were observed, as compared to the control group, regarding the amount of type II pneumocytes and their granular content fixed and colored with Os I .5. PharmacokineticsThe pharmacokinetic tests titrimetric method on urine , after the oral administration of 200 mg kg of the esters, in the rats, showed preferential renal excretion, within 24 hours after administration, to the extent of 60 of the original dose in an unaltered form and 40 in the form of non sulfhy drylic, sulfurated organic. compounds. When administering i.p., these percentages go up, respectively, to about 85 and 15 . On the other hand, the hematic peak is obtained within one hour, for oral administration, and within one half hour for i.p. administration. Hematic levels for the new products are still determinable four hours after administration.This represents a substantial difference from other thiols derivatives of cysteine, cysteinamine, penicillamine which, instead, are prevalently excreted as inorganic sulfates be cause of their being completely metabolized.These results demonstrate the ready absorbment and rapid excretion of the compounds through the urine. It is deduced, times these facts, that the new compounds unexpect edly act, prevalently, in this way. This characteristic probably constitutes the most surprizing and interesting aspect of the new products. The new compounds can be administered orally, rectally or parenterally, diluted and supported by the usual, wellknown pharmaceutical excipients.Just by way of simple illustration, we herewith submit the two, typical, tested formulas shown below Pills or capsulesThiolic ester 750 mg Ethylcellulose 150 mgS. 4 pills per day SuppositoriesThiolic ester 30Q mgFatty acid triglycerides g.b. to 3 g S. 3 per day
