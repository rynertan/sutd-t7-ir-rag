# Apparatus to assist esophageal speech.

## Abstract
An apparatus 16 to assist esophageal speech in an individual who has undergone a laryngectomy who has a tracheastome 10 and a tracheal esophageal fistula 20 . The apparatus 16 comprising an elastomeric tube 18 with an open tracheal end 26 and an esophageal end having a one way slit valve 24 normally closed which allows air to be diverted from the trachea to the esophagus when the tracheastome is sealed and the patient exhales. The elas tomeric air tube 18 has an elliptical cross section which contributes to higher rates of air flow and comfortable expiration pressures by reducing the bending movement of the portions of the tube located on either side of the slit or flapper valve 24 . The contacting surfaces of the slit valve are coated with an adhesion reducing coating 46 to further reduce opening pressure. A retaining flange 22 formed in a plane extending generally perpendicularly from the air tube does not cover the portion of the neck having the tracheas tome, thus forming no significant obstruction to breathing. A malleable planar material 40 is embedded in the flange. The flange is formed in a generally V shape to avoid the cleidomastoid neck muscles thus reducing the tendency of the device to be ejected.
