# wiping system for magnetic recording disks.

## Abstract
A protective jacket for permanently containing a floppy type magnetic recording disk 9 includes a liner 35 at tached to at least one 13 of the interior sidewalls of the jacket in a manner whereby a protruding warp is formed in the liner 35 having the form of an elongated ridge 40 . The warp protrudes far enough from the interior wall 13 of the jacket so that, upon rotation of the disk 9 , the warp is deformed and resiliently wipes the face of the disk to re move dust and the like, thereby preventing errors in read ing writing upon the disk.
