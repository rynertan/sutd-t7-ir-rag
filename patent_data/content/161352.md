## Description
ELEVATED TOILET SEAT INCLUDING CLAMPING MEANSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Prior to the present invention invalids and others who experience difficulty in sitting and raising from a conventional toilet seat have used raised toilet seats which are superimposed upon conventional toilets.The raised superimposed toilet seats are disposed directly on the bowl of the conventional toilet and afford comfort to the user as is desired.Clamps have been provided to securely mount the raised superimposed seats to the conventional toilet. Raised superimposed toilet seats of this type are described and claimed in commonly assigned copending U.S. patent applications 554,785 filed on November 11, 1983 by John Broeils and 578,849 filed on February 10, 1984 by Theodore Lenosky, the present inventor. Raised superimposed toilet seats, while serving the desired purposes, have a configuration which differs significantly from that of a conventional toilet seat. Moreover, they require considerable storage space. Both of these are disadvantages which can be a deterrent to their use. The elevated toilet seat of the present invention overcomes these disadvantages. The toilet seat closely resembles that ofa conventional toilet and removable clamps are provided for clamping the seat to the bowl of the conventional toilet. The entire toilet seat and clamping arrangement provides economy in space so as to facilitate storage. Moreover, the clamping means is adjustable in regard to the conventional toilet as is desirable. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an elevated toilet seat including clamping means for adjustably clamping the toilet seat to the bowl of a conventional toilet, whereby the disadvantages of other toilet seat arrangements for like purposes are overcome.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention contemplates an elevated toilet seat including clamping means, whereby the seat has a plurality of channels disposed on the underside therof. A corresponding plurality of clamps are provided.Each of the clamps removably engages a respective channel and adjustably engages the rim of the bowl of a conventional toilet, whereby the seat is maintained in an elevated position relative to the bowl. The arrangement is such that the clamps are displaceable in the channels away from and toward the center of the toilet seat to provide the aforenoted adjustable feature. The clamps may be tightened against the toilet bowl rim to secure the seat thereto so as to provide the appropriate degree of stability. The channels and the clamps may be arranged for engagement which prevents undesirable movement of the clamps relative to the channels.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a bottom view of an elevated toilet seat according to the invention and showing the channels arranged on the underside thereof. Figure 2 is a sectional view particularly showing clamps engaged in the channels according to the invention. Figure 3 is an end view particularly showing a clamp engaged in a channel and arranged with a conventional toilet bow . Figure 4 is a side view likewise showing a clamp engaged in a channel and arranged with the rim of a conventional toilet bowl. Figure 5 is a perspective view of a typical channel and particularly showing serrations carried by the channel according to an embodiment of the invention. Figure 6 is a partial perspective view showing a typical clamp, with the surface of the clamp carrying serrations for engaging the serrations carried by the channel as shown in Figure 5. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION With reference first to Figure 1 a toilet seat is designated by the numeral 2. Toilet seat 2 may be a conventional, commercially available toilet seat without the usual hinging mechanism whereby the seat is hinged to a conventional toilet so as to be raised and lowered relative theretoIn this connection seat 2 may be of pressed wood or plastic, o any other material from which conventional toilet seats are made. A plurality of channels, shown for purposes of illustration as four in number and carrying the numerical designation 4, are disposed around the underside 5 of toilet seat 2 and secured thereto by rivets, bolts, screws or the like 6. Channels 4 are spaced around seat underside 5 to provide an appropriate degree of stability when the clamps engage the channels to clamp the seat to a conventional toilet bowl as will hereinafter become evident. Channels 4 may be molded of a suitable plastic material. A splash guard 8 of a suitable plastic material surrounds opening 9 and extends from underside 5 and into the conventional toilet bowl when the elevated toilet seat described herein is used therewith so as to provide a sanitary feature as will be readily understood. With reference to Figures 2 and 3 clamps designated by the numeral 10 are disposed in channels 4, with splash guard 8 being secured to the inside of the clamps by rivets, bolts, screws or the like 9. Clamps 10 may be molded of a suitable plastic material. Clamps 10 are seen as having a relatively thick inside leg 12 to which splash guard 8 is secured and a relatively thin outside leg 14 integral with but in spaced relation to leg 12, whereby leg 14 is displaceable away from and toward leg 12 as best shown in Figures 4 and 6. Clamp leg 12 carries a lip 16.at its lower end and a threaded bushing 18 above lip 16. Bushing 18 receives in threaded engagement a bolt or screw or the like 20 which extends through a hole 21 in leg 14 Figure 3 , whereby clamp 10 may be tightened against the rim of a conventional toilet bowl as will be hereinafter further described with reference to Figure 4. Screw 20 may be molded of a suitable plastic material. As shown in Figure 2, leg 14 extends beyond leg 12 so as to extend beyond the rim of the conventional toilet bowl as shown in Figure 4. With reference now to Figure 3, clamps 10 have an upper portion or base 22 which fits into channels 4. Channels 4 are formed by a pair of opposing L shaped members 24 extending from a base 26. Clamp base 22 is received in sliding fit relation between opposing L shaped members 24. The arrangement of clamps 10 with a conventional toilet bowl 26 is best illustrated in Figure 4. It will be noted that conventional bowls 26 have a flanged rim 28 at least on the inside thereof. Lip 16 of clamp leg 12 engages flanged rim 28. Leg 14, which is displaceable away from and toward member 12 as aforenoted, is adjacent the outside of bowl 26 when clamp 10 is arranged in channel 4 as shown in Figure 3. Screw 20 may be tightened to secure clamp lip 16 to flanged rim 28 of toilet bowl 26 as will now be understood. With reference again to Figure 3, clamp base 22 which fits into channel 4 fits into the channel in sliding fit relationship as aforenoted, and is therefore slideable away from and toward the center of toilet seat 2 as indicated by the arrows in Figure 1, to thereby accommodate toilet bowl size differences. With reference to Figures 5 and 6, a feature of the invention is shown wherein a more positive engagement of clamp 10 and channel 4 is provided. Thus, with reference to Figure 5, channel 4, formed by opposingL shaped members 24, is seen to carry serrations 30 on the inside of its base 26. With reference to Figure 6, base 22 of clamp 10 is seen to carry like serrations 32 on its outside surface. Thus, when clamp 10 is disposed in channel 4 between L shaped members 24, serrations 30 and 32 engage so as to lock or otherwise secure the clamp in a desired position in the channel as may be desired to provide for a more positive engagement of the base and channel. It will be understood that clamp 10 and channel 4 may be molded from a suitable plastic material. Likewise, screws 20 may be of a similar material as also may be sanitary shield 8. The elevated toilet seat including clamping means described herein provides a toilet seat arrangement wherein the toilet seat closely resembles the configuration of a conventional toilet seat and has the advantages of being less cumbersome and more suitable for storage than toilet seats hpretofore known for the purposes described. Clamps 10 may be removed from channels 4 by exercising an appropriate force as will now be understood. The arrangement described maxamizes user comfort and stability and enhances the use of toilet seats by invalids and others who suffer immobilizing infirmaties to the extent that they are unable to use conventional toilet seats. With the aforegoing description of the invention in mind reference is had to the appended claims for a definiton of the scope of the invention. The figures used in the claims are only meant to explain more clearly the intention of the invention and are not supposed to be any restriction concerning the interpretation of the invention.
