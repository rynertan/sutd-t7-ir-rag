## Description
Power SuPercondlxoting Cables This invention relates to multifilamentary composite power superconducting cables. Background of the inventionIt is known that for technologically advanced electrotechnical applications in particular for example coils for large superconducting magnets and rotors for big turbo alternators where it is necessary to carry high irrents in high intensity magnetic fields, it is technically and economically convenient to have recourse to power superconducting cables.Technologically advanced power supercondleting cables are, for example, the ones consisting of a certain number of superconducting elements assembled with one another by stranding, each of said superconducting elements being composed by a plurality of supercond1loting filaments stabilized in a copper matrix.Said superconducting elements are more completely defined by the term multifilamentary in relation to said plurality of filaments, and by the term composite in relation to said copper matrix, which must axert a stabilization Qanetion as copper is a conductor capable of providing a secondary way to short filament sections, if any, which may undergo a transition from the superconducting state to the normal state as a consequence of local temperature increases. It is known that the superconducting state is typical of very low temperatures . Said superconducting filaments have diameters of the order of 10 40 microns, and are generally composed byNb Ti alloys at 40 52 of Ti expressed by weight , since said alloy exhibits the following typical feat tyres it is easy to produce, it is superconducting in itself i.e. it does not need any specific heat treatments to become superconducting and highly plastic, and therefore easily transformable, by means of the usually known plastic processings such as extrusion, cold rolling and drawing into the filaments forming the abovesaid superconducting elements.In relation to the aforesaid characteristics, the sllper conducting elements based on the utilization of filam ents consisting of said alloy or of an alloy having analogous characteristics are also easily assemblable with one another by Istrandingt thus forming the above mentioned power cables chiefly since the superconducting characteristics of said Nb Ti alloy are not adversely affected by mechanical workings and do not need, for being developed as already explained hereinbefore , any heat treatments after the chemical forming of the alloy itself.The stranding of said superconducting elements is therefore usually accomplished on a metallic support to which said elements are tin brazed in order to render the desired power cable mechanically reliable from both a static and dynamic viewpoint. The so stranded superconducting elements are then inserted into a metallic coating in order to impart improved mechanical resistance properties to said power cable obtaining furthermore prop er spacings between cable an coating for the circulation of liquid helium when the abovesaid support is not provided with a specific inner hole . It is apparent that the aforesaid stranding, tin brazing and coating involve thermomechanical treatments which can be carried out when utilizing, for the superconducting filaments involved, said Nb Ti alloy and the like, while the same treatments are not spplicable if one should desire to use, for the same purpose, a few intermetic compounds of crystallographic group A i 5, such as for example Nb Al this compound, in fact,along 3 with significantly higher superconducting characteristics than the ones of the abovesaid Nb Ti alloy, exhibits the serious drawback of being very brittle,wherefore it is practically impossible to obtain it in the form of sl3perconducting filaments and elements stranded with one another by means of plastic and mechanical processings by conseqirence its chemical forming shall be obtained only at the conclusion of the power cable manufacturing cycle,thronth a diffusion thermal treatment at 800 10000C between its two constituents Nb and Al physically coupled from the beginning to the end of the entire man1lfactlring cycle of the abovesaid superconduct ing elements and relevant stranding and costing cited hereinbefore.It is apparent that the above mentioned diffusion thermal treatment at high temperature is incompatible with the above cited tin brazing stranding process, and that, more generally, said stranding technology is employable only when the superconducting filaments of the power cables in question consist of metal alloys which possess the desired superconducting characteristics already before said strancin vbrazing operation and which are capable of retaining them also after plastic and mechanical processings , and which, in any case, do not rewire high temperature thermal treatments after the above mentioned strandin vbrazing operation.The power cables based on the use of superconducting elements with filaments made of said Nb Ti alloy can operate in magnetic fields of the order of 6 8 teslas 7 tesla 10 gasses . For applications in higher magnetic fields it is indispensable to employ,for said filaments, materials having higher superconducting characteristics, such as, for example, the above cited intermetal compound Nb3Al, for which as already explained the above illustrated stranding tech nology is not applicable for the purposes of manlfact uring the power cables in question, What told hereinbefore with regard to Nb Al also ap 3 plies to other compounds of said chrystallogrephic group A 15, for example Nb Sn. 3 Summary of the inventionThus, it is an object of the present invention to provide power superconducting cables consisting of multifilamentary composite superconducting elements, stranded without brazing on a metallic core and endowed with high characteristics of electrical and mechanical, tatic And dynamic reliability.This snd still other objects,which will more clearly appear to a technician skilled in the art from the following description, are achieved by a cable which comprises a plurality of niultifilamentary composite superconducting elements assembled by stranding on a aetal core waving an inner longitudinal hole, intended for the circulation of liquid helium, as well as hole seats arranged parallelly to one another and longitudinally helically developing on the outer wall of said core, in Which seats said superconducting elements are individually housed in close interface contact with such seats, an external metal sheath enclosing said so stranded superconducting elements, said sheath being forced against said elements and against said core, such elem ends being highly compacted in the corresponding above mentioned seats. Description of the preferred embodimentA preferred, but non exclusive embodiment of the present invention is hereinafter described making reference to the foregoing and to figure 1 of the only drawing attached hereto and being an integrant part of the present description.Said figure schematically shows, for illustrative purposes, an enlarged cross section of the cable in question in this figure the numerals indicate 1 the metallic core, made of copper 2 the inner hole in said core, intended for the circnlstion of liquid helium 3 .,the hole seats housing the superconducting elements 4 the superconducting elements 5 the outer copper sheath. According to the present invention, the number of superconducting elements 4 and of the corresponding hole seats 3 varies as a function of the applicative requirements for example, for a 6 tesla, 6000 A cable, the number of superconducting elements and of corres ponding hole seats is usually 12. The screw pitch according to which hole seats 3 develop on the wall of core 1 ranges from 25 to 50 cm. The dimensions of core 1 and the thickness of sheath 5 are selected, by a technician skilled in the art, in ac cordance with the complexity and the utilization of the cable object of this invention.The core and sheath copper is st a high purity degree, preferably it is electrolytic copper.Elements 4 are of the multifilamentary composite type,with filaments stabilized in a copper matrix, said filaments being prepared from a coupled Nb Al material,in which Nb and Al retain their atomic identity till the conclusion of the mechanical processes for manufacturing said elements 4 and for assembling same by stranding and coating in order to form the power cable of the invention.The forming of superconducting intermetallic compound Nb 3Al within said filaments by diffusion between Nb and Al, which are the constituents thereof, is ca ,sed by diffnzsinn at about 850or then the above said cable has no longer to be tzbjected to any plastic processing, and preferably when said cable has already undergone the winding operation to form, for example, a coil of a supercondlloting magnet in such manner said Nb3 Al compound which is very brittle thxoughly and perfectly retains all its chemical, physical and morphological properties.Elements 4 may be advantageously produced in like man ner as is described hereinbefore with regard to coupled Nb Al filaments also with filaments consisting of a coupled Nb Al Ge alloy material from which, by diffusion thermal treatment, intermetallic compound Nb3Alo 8GeO 2 of crystallographic group A 15 is ob 3 tained, which, as is known, possesses the highest superconducting characteristics known so far.More generally, the present invention can be advantageously practiced by utilizing elements 4 formed by filaments of said crystallographic group A 15, such as Nb3Sn, or also by other filaments consisting of Nb Ti alloys and the like in the latter case, the advantages of this invention reside chiefly in the high mechanical reliability of the corresponding power cable and in the technological simplification of the process for obtaining same. ExampleFrom the example of embodiment hereinafter described, and given for merely illustrative sad not limitative purposes, it is still better apparent how the cable of the present invention is made and also how it can be manufactured.Said example makes reference to figures 1 and 2 of the enclosed above mentioned drawing, wherein in figure 2 which sehematically shows,for illustrative purposes, an enlarged cross section of the cable at an intermediate stage of its manufacture numerals 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 indicate the same components as in figure 1, and 6 indicates the fins of the hole seats in the shape they exhibit prior to the last plastic processings which impart to the power cable its final geometric form as explained later herein , 7 inflicates the weld beads of the two copper semi tubes constituting outer sheath 5. The example described herein refers to the maniifacture of a power superconducting cable outside diameter 15.1 mm composed by 14 superconducting elements 4 with circular section outside diameter 1.71 mm , each of them consisting of 61 filaments diameter 110 140 microns , essentially made of intermetallic compound h b Al, stabilized in a copper matrix.Each of 3 said 14 elements is obtained by the process described in Italian patent No. 1,004,408 of July10, 1976J name ly aubstantially and conceptually as follows two strips of Nb and Al are coupled by superimpos ition, anl the bimetallic strip so obtained is wound around a copper core wire diameter 6 mm , thus ob taining a coil which, in its turn, is inserted into a copper cylindric container.The Cu Al Nb composite article so obtained is transformed, by plastic pro cessing, into a monofilamentary cable of hexagonal section, from which 61 cable sections are cut, which in their turn are assembled and inserted into a second cylindrical copper container having a hexagonal central hole the resulting multifilamentary composite article is transformed, by plastic processing, into the desired circular section supercondloting element , consisting of 61 filaments of coupled Nb Al material, in which filaments the relevant components Nb and Al still retain their atomic identity and the thereto connected good plastic properties which permit their further mechanical workings, necessary to carry out the technological cycle for the manufscturing of the power cables of the invention, as is described hereinbelow with reference to said figure 2.Fourteen superconducting elements obtained according to the technique illustrated hereinabove are assembled with one another by stranding by means of a known mechanized technique by inserting said elements into 14 hole seats 3 of semiircular section with fins 6 machined on the outer wall of a copper core 1 obtained by means of extrusion with the geometry represented in cross section in figure 2 and with helical longitudinal development with a pitch equal to 30 cm.The sizes of said hole seats correspond to those of the above mentioned superconducting elements, with minimum allowances in excess, sufficient for the in sertion of such elements into their respective seats. The above cited cables so stranded are sheathed with two coppetSsemitubes, which are successively electro welded to their longitudinal interfaces 7 to form a sheath 5 enveloping stranded cables 4 the resulting manufactured article consisting of said stranded and sheathed cables is then subjected to drawing ac cording to a conventional technique whereby the pressing of fins 6 against superconducting elements 4 as well as the intense adhesion compression of sheath 5 against superconducting elements 4 and core 1 are achieved, thus obtaining, finally, a multifila mentary composite power superconducting cable exhibit ing the geometry shown in section in figure 1, and possessing high characteristics of electrical and mechanical, static and dynamic reliability. By winding said cable, No. 6 coils for compact super conducting magnets are manufactured, which, once formed in their final configuration, are subjected to a thermal treatment at B5O0Cthat causes the forming c intermetallic compound Nb3tl by diffusion between Brand Al which constitute the filaments of which super condncting elements 4 are made. As.is known, it is said compound that at the temperatures of liquid helium displays high superconducting characteristics. From the preceding description and example the ad vantages of the present invention are clearly apparent, the same being synthetically summarizable as follows high mechanical, static and dynamic characteris tics high reliability of the above cited mechanical and electrical characteristics technological manufacturing easiness.The present invention can be practiced with technically equivalent modifications and variations, falling however within the inventive concept of the invention.
