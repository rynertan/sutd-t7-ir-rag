# Pressure responsive control device.

## Abstract
A pressure responsive control device, particularly for controlling the operation of a pump to maintain the pressure level of a fluid in a reservoir within a predeter mined pressure range, comprising a sensor which com pares said pressure level with a reference pressure atmos pheric air and a switch which is actuated by said sensor as a function of the difference between said pressures and which itself controls the operation of the pump. According to this invention, the force exerted by the pressure difference on a first movable wall 38, 48 which closes a first chamber 30 in the sensor 18 is opposed by a lesser force exerted by same pressure difference on a sec ond movable wall 52, 58 which separates said first chamber 30 from a second chamber 32 which itself is connectable either to the reference pressure or to the first chamber as a result of the displacement of said walls, thus providing for snap actuation of the associated switch 16 . For use particularly in controlling operation of vacuum pumps in automotive vehicles.
