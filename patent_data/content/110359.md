# Lacing up of thread treating nozzles.

## Abstract
A texturising jet for synthetic filaments is openable and closable to facilitate lacing up. A lacing up system is operable in conjunction with the opening and closing mechanism so that the lace up operation is semi automatic. At least one of the parts of the jet has a flexible mounting to ensure face to face sealing contact of the parts when the jet is closed.
