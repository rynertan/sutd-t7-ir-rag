# Anthracycline compounds and anticancer agents.

## Abstract
Anthracycline compounds consisting of an antitumor substance of the anthracycline family and a hydrophilic polypeptide rich in hydrophobic amino acid units and having a molecular weight in the range from 10,000 to 15,000, wherein said antitumor substance and said polypeptide are combined through hydrogen bonds and or hydrophobic bonds, are useful anticancer agents having high effective ness and low toxicity. These anthracycline compounds may be prepared by combing the hydophilic polypeptide with the antitumor substance of the anthracycline family in a com mon solvent and isolating the formed compounds.
