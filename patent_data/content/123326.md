# Method for cell culture growth.

## Abstract
A cell culture device is disclosed for the cultivation of animal, plant, mocrobiological or artificial cells. The device involves a three dimensional arrangement of fibers within a housing arranged to provide maximum exposed fiber surface flow channel diameter while also reducing the tortuosity of the flow path. Cells are bound to the fibers to allow them to contact nutrient fluid solution and thereby to remove any substances originating in said cells, such as viruses and pharmaceuticals.
