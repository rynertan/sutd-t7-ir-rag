# Float valve.

## Abstract
A float valve mechanism for a cistern or tank comprising a housing 20, 22 defining a closed chamber 24 having an inlet port 26 connected to an inlet pipe 16 to the cistern or tank, an outlet port 28 from the chamber having a valve seat 30 surrounding the port. A valve member 34 passes through the opening and has a valve head located within the chamber, the valve head being integrally formed, preferably from a plastic material, with a lever 38 which is pivotal about axis 42 and carries a float 54 . The valve head 36 is pivotally movable an integral manner with the lever along a path passing through the outlet port 28 of the chamber. Water pressure within the chamber normally urges the valve to the closed position and the weight of the float when the water has fallen below a given level in the tank overcomes this pressure to allow water to flow from the chamber into the cistern.
