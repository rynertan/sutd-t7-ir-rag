# DEVICE FOR PULLING UP SLIDER OF A SLIDE FASTENER CHAIN

## Abstract
A device for pulling up the slider of a slide fastener chain includes a pair of slider gripping fingers provided in opposed relation, one on each side of a slider guide groove formed in a slide fastener chain guide. The slider guide groove constitutes part of a slider passageway through which a slide fastener hav ing a slider mounted thereon is capable of being passed and guided. The fingers are operatively associated with each other and coupled to an actuating mechanism which thrusts the fing ers into the passageway to grip a slider and pull the slider up to a predetermined position as the slide fastener chain advances through the passageway, and which then withdraws the fing ers from the passageway to release their grip on the slider so that the slider may pass through the passageway with the rest of the travelling fastener chain.
