# PROCESS FOR CONTINUOUSLY PRODUCING A POLYMERIC LAMINATE TAPE HAVING A PLURALITY OF METAL WIRES EMBEDDED THEREWITHIN

## Abstract
A metal wire containing polymeric laminate tape is con tinuously produced by superimposing a pair of primary cross linked, electro insulating thermoplastic polymer tapes face to face along the longitudinal axes thereof under tension, while a plurality of metal wires are interposed, under tension, paral lel to each other, between the primary tapes along the longi tudinal axes thereof by heating the resultant precursory lami nate tape up to a temperature of from 10 to 120 C above the melting point of the corresponding thermoplastic polymer which is not cross linked by pressing the heated precursory laminate tape by using a pair of elastic pressing rolls, whereby the primary tapes are heat bonded together to provide a body of laminate matrix within which the metal wires are embedded and, optionally, by cooling the resultant laminate tape.
