# DATA TRANSMISSION SYSTEM

## Abstract
The domestic communication network 1 has a main control unit 2 which can selectively address sixteen separate stations 3 by sending signals along the common electrical mains wiring 4. Each station 3 has a unique four bit address identity, while each signal sent out by control unit 2 has an address signal formed of a four bit address word and a mask code and a data signal. The mask code informs the stations of how many bits in the address word are to be ignored. Each station 3 has a unit 5 to extract, from the address signal, the mask code and input it to subtractors 6 and 7, for modification of the station identity and the received signal to the same number of most significant bits. Suitable equiva lence at a comparator 9 actuates a switch 10 for activation of a circuit 11.
