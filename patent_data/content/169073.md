## Description
COMPONENTS FOR JOINING OR TERMINATING OPTICAL FIBERS This invention relates to components and procedures for making low loss connections for optical fibers and optical devices. More particularly, this invention relates to components for joining or terminating optical fibers such as optical fiber connectors, optical fiber splices,optical fiber couplers, etc. made from certain thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers. The prior optical fiber art teaches various procedures with the objective of obtaining low loss connections between lengths of fibers, i.e., between lengths of single fibers, lengths of multiple fiber bundles, in multiplexing and demultiplexing, etc. One way of connecting fibers is simply to press the ends of the fibers together by means of a connector, for which various designs are known in the art. The ends of the fibers may be first prepared by polishing, or breaking, or slicing to obtain a more uniform defect free surface that results in lower loss. Another means of reducing connection loss are lenses attached to the ends of the fibers, or index matching fluids that fill the gap between the ends of the fibers.Another technique which avoids many of the problems concomitant with employing index matching fluids is the use of a transparent flexible index matching dome of plastic material, such as silicone rubber, that adheres to the ends of the connectors and bridges the gap between the ends of the fibers.Thus,fiber optic connectors essentially have been devices for physically bringing the ends of two of more fibers together closely and accurately enough so as to minimize the disturbance of the optical waveguide geometry of the fibers as light passes from one to the other and avoid attenuation or loss as measured in decibels dB . Disadvantageously, except for those situations involving very large diameter fibers, extreme mechanical property tolerances have been required. In particular, connectors intended for small core communications grade fibers with less than 1 decibel dB loss have been possible only by using very expensive components which require individua attention to machining and aligning of the various parts. A serious cause of attenuation or decibel loss in a fiber optic system is caused by scattering, i.e. light escaping the bound modes of the optical fiber. It generally consists of three types intrinsic,inhomogeneity of the glass or plastic optic fiber and aberrations in the radial form of the refractive index. One cause of such scattering is the influence of lateral forces microbending on the optical fibers which is evidenced by a significant decrease or disruption of the transition through the fiber at site of the lateral force. It has also been demonstrated that this effect is reversible. The disadvantageous influence of lateral forces can be attributed to displacement of the cladding or sheath with respect to the optic fiber core by the applied forces, thus disturbing the total reflection and causing scattering and, as a consequence, decreasing or attenuating the transmission. Another cause for excessive losses in fiber optic connectors is caused by alignment difficulties. In fiber optics, it is found that variations in the axial direction of the connector must be critically controlled because the light from the transmitting fiber is in the form of a cone and the amount of light coupled into the receiving fiber will decrease as the fibers move away from each other. This alignment of the fiber core creates the most loss, while angular misalignment adds slightly to the total accumulated loss. While the patent literature includes numerous fiber or fiber bundle connector or interface devices, none provide the advantageous device of the present invention.

U.S. Patent No. 4,352,542 of Tydings, issued October 5, 1982, discloses a connector constructed with a thin wall tube of beryllium copper enclosing three strips of a shaped memory alloy material such as nitinol alloy. The three strips are bent and inserted into the thin wall tube such that an axial cavity is formed between the three opposing bent radii of the strips thus providing a self centering mechanism for positioning fiber optic cable ends along the central axis of the tube. Outside the optical fiber art there have been disclosures of a wide variety of materials for various purposes.Among them are disclosures of a great variety of polymers.Among the polymer disclosures is the following The use of various fillers in conjunction with liquid crystalline polymers is disclosed in our U.S. Patent No.4,067,852. This U.S. Patent teaches that fillers and or reinforcing agents may be included in a total concentration of about 1 to 60 by weight of the resulting molding compound.Representative fibers which may serve as reinforcing media therein include glass fibers, asbestos, graphitic carbon fibers, amorphous carbon fibers, synthetic polymer fibers, aluminum fibers, aluminum silicate fibers, oxide of aluminum fibers, titanium fibers, magnesium fibers, rock wool fibers, steel fibers, tungsten fibers, cotton wool, and wood cellulose fibers , etc. If desired, the fibrous reinforcement may be preliminarily treated to improve its adhesion ability to the liquid crystalline polymer which ultimately serves as a continuous matrix phase. Representative filler materials disclosed in this U.S. Patent include calcium silicate, silica,clays, talc,mica, polytetrafluoroethylene, graphite, aluminum trihydrate, sodium aluminium carbonate and barium ferrite. Our co pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 464, 272, filed February 7, 1983, teaches the addition of wollastonite fibers to liquid crystalline polymers in amounts of from 10 to 70 by weight. Thus, the incorporation of various filler materials into liquid crystalline polymers has been investigated as shown above. However, there is no contemplation or disclosure of the use thereof in components for joining or terminating optical fibers. It has now surprisingly been found that certain liquid crystalline polymers can be used to form highly advantageous components for joining or terminating optical fibers. It has also been found that the efficacy of these polymers may be controlled by incorporating appropriate amounts of filler materials in the polymer composition. The invention provides a component for joining or terminating optical fibers which is a polymer molding, characterised in that the polymer is a thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer having a linear coefficient of thermal expansion of from 5 to 10 micrometer meter OC in the temperature range from 500C to 850C. The linear coefficient of thermal expansion may be appropriately controlled by incorporating a filler material in the polymer in an amount in the range from 5 to 60 by weight of the total composition. The invention makes it possible to obtain a number of significant advantages. One advantage is the maintenance of coupling or connecting efficiency by the reduction of undesirable losses. Other advantages will appear from the following description. By providing a material which exhibits a linear coefficient of thermal expansion in the flow direction of molded articles compatible with optical fibers, it is possible to reduce undesirable axial and lateral forces. It is possible to achieve dimensional stability even under pronounced temperature variations. It is possible to provide radiation resistance in addition to moisture and chemical resistance. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention,a component for joining or terminating optical fibers is molded of a thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer which has a linear coefficient of thermal expansion LCTE of from 5 to 10 micrometer meter oC, preferably 3 to 6 micrometer meter 0C, and most preferably has a linear coefficient of thermal expansion matching that of the fiber optic incorporated in the component of the present invention, in each instance over a temperature range of from 5O0C to 850C. An important aspect is that the components employing the thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers of the present invention evidence little or no warpage and, thus, a minimum of Induced internal stresses as compared to prior art materials. In the preferred embodiment of this invention,the linear coefficient of thermal expansion is controlled by incorporating one or more filler materials in precise amounts with the liquid crystalline polymers. Various filler materials may be included in a total concentration of 5 to 60 and over by weight of the total material and preferably in a concentration of 10 to 30 . Representative filler inorganic materials include wollastonite, calcium silicate, silica,clays,talc, mica, polytetrafluoroethylene,graphite, sodium aluminum carbonate, and barium ferrite. Wollastonite and fused silica are the preferred materials. It is also contemplated that colorants, for example, carbon black can be added to the liquid crystalline materials of the present invention. Components in accordance with the invention are illustrated in the drawings, in which Figure 1 depicts an in line coupler comprising a coupling block containing the adjacent ends of two optical fibers and illustrates the flow direction of the molded coupling block relative to said optical fibers. Figure 2 depicts a ferrule for use in connectors terminating optical cables and illustrates the flow direction of the molded ferrule relative to said optical cable. The following description covers polymer materials and techniques for utilizing same which are suitable for use with the optical fiber components of the present invention. The components are employed for joining or terminating optical fibers. Used herein, the term optical fiber means those fibers that provide a propagation path for electromagnetic energy in the visible, infrared, or ultraviolet regions of the spectrum. The fibers most usually comprise a core with a sheath or cladding surrounding same.Glass and plastic are the most typical fiber core materials and the sheath or cladding may also comprise glass or plastic.Unless otherwise denoted, both single optical fiber cables and multiple fiber cables are included in the term optical fiber . The term optical device includes sources,detectors, mixers, filters, and other devices operating in the visible, infrared, or ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and the term light includes visible, infrared, and ultraviolet light. The term component means any device that either terminates one or more optical fibers, joins two or more optical fibers or joins one or more optical fibers to an optical device, etc. and includes, by way of example, optical fiber connectors, connector bodies,splicers, couplers,etc. The term thermotropic means a polymeric material which, on fusion, forms an ordered melt.The term liquid crystalline polymer means an anisotropic polymer having a molecular weight of at least 1,000 and which is suitable for use as a molding resin. An essential property of the optical fiber components according to the invention is that they are made of a thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer which exhibits a linear coefficient of thermal expansion of 5 to 10 micro meter meter C, and preferably 3 to 6 micrometer meter oC, in the flow direction of the molded components, over a range of temperatures of from 5O0C to 850C. It is especially preferred to utilize a thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer which has a linear coefficient of thermal expansion, i.e., in the flow direction, substantially equal to that of the optical fiber which is contained in and used in conjunction with the connector fabricated from said polymeric material.This linear coefficient of thermal expansion also should be substantially uniform over a temperature range of from 500C to 850C. In accordance with the invention, it is also important to align the optical fiber axially with the flow direction of the molded liquid crystalline polymer from which the component is fabricated. Referring to Figure 1, the end portions of two optical fibers 1 and 2 are coupled end to end in mutual alignment by means of a coupling member consisting of a body 3 of the liquid crystalline polymer of the present invention. Shading lines 4 indicate the flow direction in the body 3 of the molded liquid crystalline polymer. In accordance with the invention, it is important that the optical fibers be positioned or aligned within said body 3 in the flow direction of the molded crystalline polymer. Figure 2 shows a ferrule 10 having a fiber optic cable 12 positioned therein. The fiber optic cable 12 illustrated within the ferrule 10 is of a known type and includes jacketing material 14 surrounding an optical fiber 16 which is normally coated with a cladding material 18 having an index of refraction compatible with that of the fiber. In order to achieve fully the benefits of the present invention, it is important that the fiber optic cable 12 and the optic fiber 16 contained therein be aligned axially with the flow direction of the molded liquid crystalline polymer which is represented by shading lines 20. A second property of the components of this invention is that they are structurally sound over a wide range of conditions. For example, they evidence a minimum warpage, especially in the longitudinal or flow direction of the molded article, even when subjected to the wide temperature range, e.g. from 50 to 850C, to which such products may be exposed. Thirdly, the devices exhibit excellent radiation resistance, e.g., as evidenced by no significant deleterious effect on tensile and flexural properties when exposed to 500 megarads of Cobalt 60 gamma radiation. The products of this invention also exhibit excellent moisture and chemical resistance. The polymer from which the components of the present invention is formed is a thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer which is of the requisite molecular weight to be capable of being molded, i.e. shaped by injection molding or melt extrusion or the like. Such thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers have been known in the art but have not prior to the present invention been recognized to be suitable for forming the presently claimed components for joining or terminating optical fibers which show the surprising physical and chemical properties discussed herein. As is known in polymer technology, a thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer exhibits optical anisotropy in the melt. The anisotropic character of the polymer melt may be confirmed by conventional polarized light techniques wherein cross polarizers are utilized. More specifically, the anisotropic nature of the melt phase may conveniently be confirmed by the use of a Leitz polarizing microscope at a magnification of 40X with the sample on a Leitz hot stage and under a nitrogen atmosphere. The amount of light transmitted changes when the sample is forced to flow however, the sample is optically anisotropic even in the static state. On the contrary, typical melt processable polymers do not transmit light to any substantial degree when examined under identical conditions. Representative classes of polymers from which the thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer suitable for use in the present invention may be selected include wholly aromatic polyesters, aromatic aliphatic polyesters, wholly aromatic poly ester amides , aromatic aliphatic poly ester amides , aromatic polyazomethines, aromatic polyester carbonates,and mixtures of the same. In preferred embodiments the thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer is a wholly aromatictpoly ester, a wholly aromatic polyesteramide , or an aromaticaliphatic poly ester amide . In such wholly aromatic polyester and wholly aromatic poly ester amide , each moiety present within the polymer chain contributes at least one aromatic ring.Also, it is preferred that naphthalene moieties be included in the thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer, e.g., 6 oxy 2 napthoyl moiety, 2,6 dioxynaphthalene moiety, or 2,6 dicarboxynaphthalene moiety, in a concentration of not less than 10 mole percent. The particularly preferred naphthalene moiety for inclusion in the thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer is the 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl moiety in a concentration of not less than 10 mole percent.

The fused silica used herein is composed of a relatively pure form of silicon dioxide which has been converted by means of very high temperatures commonly involving electric arc melting from its usual crystalline form to an amorphous form. Such inorganic particulate material is sometimes called fused quartz. The resulting fused particles following their formation may be ground to the desired particle size. Such material exhibits a volumetric linear coefficient of thermal expansion which approaches zero, and can undergo rapid and extreme termperature changes without creating internal stresses.Such fused silica is commercially available, and may be obtained from Harbison WalkerRefractories of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,under the designation GP71. Minor amounts of crystalline silica may be blended with the fused silica in order further to increase its thermal conductivity, if desired. In some applications, colorants for example pigments, carbon black and the like , may be employed in conjunction with the filled or unfilled liquid crystalline polymeric molding materials utilized in the present invention.Generally, any colorant may be employed when minute amounts are utilized. However, when larger amounts are employed, i.e. about five percent by weight, it is important that the colorants be thermally stable at the molding temperatures utilized, e.g. from 2500C to 4000C, and exhibit a linear coefficient of thermal expansion similar to the particulate material utilized, i.e., have a linear coefficient of thermal expansion of less than 15 micrometer meter OC,preferably less than 10 micrometer meter 0C. Other additives, adhesion promoters, lubricants, etc.may be included so long as they do not deleteriously influence the composition. In a preferred embodiment the filler material additionally bears a coating upon its surface which increases its ability to admix with the melt processable polymer which is capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase. Any coating selected must be incapbale of harming the optical fiber component or interfering with its operation during transmission of light. While not essential, it is preferred that the filler be treated with a titanate coupling agent. One coupling agent which has been used successfully is isopropyl tri dioctylpyrophosphate titanate, although fillers treated with other coupling agents or other surface treatments can be purchased from commercial suppliers. Other representative coatings are the silanes such as gamma glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane and gamma aminopropyltriethoxysilane available from the Union Carbide Corporation under the designations A187 and A1100, respectively. The surface coatings may be applied to the filler material in concentrations which are generally from 0.25 to 1.5 percent by weight in accordance with standard coating technology for mineral fillers. In accordance with the concept of the present invention, the filler material is blended with and substantially uniformly dispersed within the liquid crystalline polymer in a concentration of 5 to 60 percent, preferably 10 to 30 percent, by weight based upon the total weight of the molding composition. Such substantially uniform dispersal may be accomplished by known techniques wherein the filler material is forced within the moving molten polymeric material. Known melt compounding techniques, for example those using single screw extruders, co rotating twin screw extruders, counter rotating twin screw extruders, or kneaders, may be employed. For instance, a co rotating twin screw extruder manufactured by Werner PfleidererCorporation of Ramsey, New Jersey may be employed.When using such equipment, preformed polymer pellets and the filler material may be simply fed as a dry blend into the extruder and heated to above the melting temperature of the polymeric material. Kneading blocks advantageously may be included within the screw to aid in the blending. When introducing the filler material at high concentration levels, a multiple pass i.e., a two or more pass blending operation may be employed with only a portion of the filler material being introduced during the first pass.Alternatively,the blend of anisotropic melt forming polymer and the filler material can be prepared by adding the entire volume of filler material to the molten polymer by feeding the particles into one or more feed ports located downstream on a compounding extruder, such as a Buss Condux Kneader manufactured by Buss Condux of Elk Grove Village, Illinois,or other extruder capable of downstream addition of particles.Using this procedure,the polymer is fed into the rear of the extruder, melted, and then blended with the filler particles.With either type of blending process, the resulting molding compositions may be pelletized using either a strand or a die face pelletizing procedure. With a strand procedure, a strand of the resulting molding composition may be extruded and pelletized following passage through an air or water quench. With a cutter, the molding composition may be cut into pellets at the face of the die,with the pellets then being dropped into water to cool. The resulting molding composition commonly is capable of being injection molded at a temperature within the range of 250 to 4000C. The following Examples are specific illustrations of the invention. The invention is of course not limited to the specific details set forth in the Examples. EXAMPLE 1 A wholly aromatic polyester which exhibits thermotropic liquid crystalline properties was selected for use in the formation of an injection molded article in accordance with the present invention. The wholly aromatic polyester was formed in accordance with the teachings of U.S. Patent No. 4,161,470, and consisted of 73 mole percent of recurring p oxybenzoyl units and 27 mole percent of recurring 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl units. The wholly aromatic polyester exhibited an inherent viscosity of 6.0 dl. g. when dissolved in a concentration of 0.1 percent by weight in pentafluorophenol at 600C., and had a differential scanning calorimetry melting temperature peak of about 2800C. The above wholly aromatic polyester was used to prepare the various samples used for testing. Blending with the various wollastonite fibers at 15 weight percent of fiber and various carbon blacks at 5 weight percent of carbon black was accomplished on a co rotating twin screw extruder 30mm ZSK, manufactured by WernerPfleiderer . The carbon black was initially masterbatched with the liquid crystalline polymer LCP Runs 1A B 2A B and the wollastonite was subsequently dispersed Runs lC I and 2C H . The extrusion was accomplished at a cylinder temperature of 3000C.a percent torque between about 25 and 40, using various rpm s, and a vacuum of 30 inches when fillers were being added. The unfilled wholly aromatic polyester was put through the same blending process as the fiber containing wholly aromatic polyester to insure that all samples had been subjected to the same treatment.The composition of the various samples is shown in Table I TABLE I Black Screw SpeedSample Pearls Compounding Process rpm 1A 880 MB 20X in LCP 100 18 880 MB 20 in LCP 150 1C 880 LD of 1A 5 15 Wol. 150 1D 880 LD of 1A 5 15 Wol. 200 1E 880 LD of 1A 5 15 Wol. 250 1F 880 LD of 18 5 15 Wol. 200 1G 880 LD of 18 5X 15 Wol. 250 1H 880 Str.Disp. 5X CB 15 Wol. 150 1I 880 Str.Disp. 5 CB 15 Wol. 200 2A L MB 20 in LCP 150 28 L MB 20X in LCP 200 2C L LD of 2A 5 15 Wol. 150 2D L LD of 2A 5 15 Wol. 200 2E L LD of 2A 5 15 Wol. 250 2F L LD of 28 5 15 Wol. 200 2G L LD of 28 5 15 Wol. 250 2H L LD of 2B 5 15 Wol. 150MB Masterbatch, LD Letdown, Str.Disp.

The wholly aromatic poly ester amide exhibited an inherent viscosity of 4.41 dl. g. when dissolved in a concentration of 0.1 percent by weight in pentafluorophenol at 600C., and a differential scanning calorimetry melting temperature peak of 2840C. Molded articles fabricated from polymers prepared by the procedures of Examples 1 and 2 were exposed to Cobalt 60 gamma radiation in doses of 25, 100, 250 and 500 megarads. The dosage rate was 1.2 megarads hour at ambient temperature. As indicated in Table IV, no deleterious effect was seen on tensile or flexural properties when exposed to 500 megarads of radiation. A 500 megarad exposure reduced the heat deflection temperature HDT by about 100C. The I.V. increased by 10X after 500 megarads exposure suggesting that some cross linking was occurring.
