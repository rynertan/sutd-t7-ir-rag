# Turbo with pulse width modulated control method and means.

## Abstract
A pulse width modulated method, of controlling the supply of electrical power to an inductive load, using at least one power switch having on and off states for providing, respectively, low and high impedance paths between the inductive load and a source of power, thereby controlling the current flow through the inductive load during a sequence of regular reoccuring time periods, and wherein the at least one power switch is switched, if in the off state, to the on state substantially at the beginning of at least some of the time periods, the method of comprising the combination of steps, operative during any one of a plurality of the time periods, of switching the at least one power switch from the on state to the off state when a predetermined level of current flow has been reached flowing in one of, the inductive load and the at least one power switch and switching the at least one power switch back to the on state after the off state, independent of the occurrence of the beginning of a time period.
