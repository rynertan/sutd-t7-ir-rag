# Arrangement for routing data packets through a circuit switch.

## Abstract
Disclosed is arrangement 101, 102, 110 for routing data packets designated for a particular destination 103 from a packet switch 114 through a circuit switch 120 . The packet switch includes a plurality of output links 152, 153 con nected to the circuit switch and a memory 209 for designating a number of these output links for use to a particular destination. The circuit switch has a plurality of channels 190 to the particular destination and a switching network 121 for connecting an equal number of the multiplex channels to the designated output links. Included in the arrangement is a circuit allocator 110 that monitors the use of each output links designated for use to a particular destination. When the overall use of the designated output links is greater than an upper threshold, the allocator causes the packet switch to increase the number of links designated for use to the particular destination and subsequently causes the circuit switch to correspondingly increase the number of channels connected to the designated output links. The number of designated output links is similarly decreased when the overall use of the output links falls below a lower threshold. A predetermined algorithm is used to determine the upper and lower thresholds for each number of desig nated output links.
