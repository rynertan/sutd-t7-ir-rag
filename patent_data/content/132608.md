# Process for the polymerization of a 2,6 disubstituted phenol.

## Abstract
A process for the oxidative polymerization of a mono meric 2, 6 disubstituted phenol is carried out in the presence of a catalyst comprising a manganese compounds, an N alkylalkanolamine and a basic compound. The process produces a polyphenyleneether which does not exhibit deterioration of molecular weight and undesirable coloration when subjected to heat, such as the heat ordinarily applied in molding. The polyethyleneether has excellent tensile strength and elongation.
