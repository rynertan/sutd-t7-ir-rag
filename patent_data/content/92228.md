# Method and apparatus for controlling reduction ratio of continuously variable transmission.

## Abstract
The reduction ratio of a continuously variable trans mission is controlled by a stepper motor. The stepper motor is controlled such that each of rotary positions thereof corre sponds uniquely to a desired optimum reduction ratio indica tive signal indicative of a desired optimum reduction ratio. The desired optimum reduction ratio indicative signal is generated for operating condition of an automotive vehicle.
