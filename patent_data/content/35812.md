# Apparatus for the flotation of flocculated solid material in a liquid.

## Abstract
Flotation apparatus for flocculated solid material has a flotation tank 4 alongside a passage 3 for upward flow of liquid carrying the solid material. A wall of the passage on the side towards the tank has a top portion 11 curved over to its free edge to provide a submerged weir over which the liquid passes from the passage into the tank. To prevent turbulence in the liquid on passing over the weir and to prevent a prefe rential flow path in the flotation tank, the tank 4 itself has, on its side towards the upward flow passage, a side wall 17 which is generally spaced from the side wall 9 of the passage but joins the latter wall away from the said free edge. The tank side wall 17 slopes downwardly away from the passage from a point 19 located inwardly of the tank with respect to the free edge.
