# LIGHT DETECTING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A light detecting apparatus comprises an elongated plate shaped light guide member having an end face at one long side as a light input face and an end face at the other long side as a light output face. N number of photomulti pliers having elongated light receiving faces optically associ ated with N divisions of the light output face divided into N divisions in the length direction of the light output face of the light guide member are positioned for converting the light emitted from the divisions of the light output face into electric signals. The photomultipliers are connected to a correction circuit for electrically eliminating deterioration in sensitivity at least at adjacent photomultiplier side end portions of the photomultipliers.
