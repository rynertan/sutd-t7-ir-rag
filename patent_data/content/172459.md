# Spindle assembly for magnetic disks.

## Abstract
A spindle assembly for magnetic disks of both end support type has a hub 26 for fixing the disks, a shaft 21 to which the hub is fixed, a pair of bearings 19, 28 which are spaced in vertical or horizontal direction, a pre loading spring 27 for pre loading one of the bearings, and a housing 15, 16 composed of housing parts which accom modates the hub 26 , shaft 21 , bearings 19, 28 and the pre loading spring 27 . The spindle assembly further has an axial reference surface 36 formed on the hub at a right angle with respect to the shaft 21 , and another axial reference surface 35 formed on one of the housing parts 15 at a right angle with respect to the vertical portion of the bearing 28 associated with the one of the housing parts. When the shaft 21 is mounted in the one of the housing parts with the hub and the pre loading spring 27 fitted therearound, the hub 26 is axially urged by the spring 27 such that the axial reference surface thereon 36 is brought into abutment with the axial reference surface 35 on the one of the housing parts 15 . As a result, the axis of the spindle assembly is determined by the abutment between the reference surfaces 35, 36 and by the bearing in the one of the housing parts. The bearing 19 in the other of the housing parts 16 is axially aligned with the thus determined axis of the spindle assembly.
