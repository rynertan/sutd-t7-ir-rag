## Description
TITLEPROCESS OF HYDROFORMYLATING CYCLIC ACROLEIN ACETALSDESCRIPTIONTechnical Field This invention relates to an improved process for the hydroformylation of cyclic acrolein acetals to the corresponding aldehydes in the presence of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, rhodium complex catalyst and triphenyl phosphite ligand. More specifically, this in invention relates to the hydroformylation of cyclic acrolein acetals to the corresponding aldehydes in the presence of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, 1 50 ppm of rhodium in a rhodium complex catalyst based on the acetal and excess triphenyl phosphite ligand.Background Art Hydroformylation reactions wherein various olefines are reacted with carbon monoxide and hydrogen to form corresponding aldehydes are known in the art.For example, U.S. Patent 3,527,809 discloses the hydroformylation of alpha olefinic compounds at certain temperatures and gas pressures wherein the partial pressure of carbon monoxide is about 2S 75 of the total pressure, in the presence of certain rhodium containing complexes and organo phosphorus ligands to obtain a high linear to branched chain aldehyde isomer ratio. Rhodium 6 concentrations as low as 1 x 10 6 mole per mole of alpha olefinic feed are disclosed as operable but are said to be not particularly desirable since the reaction rate appears to be too slow and thus not commercially attrac 5 tive. A rhodium concentration of 1 X 10 5 up to 5 X 10 2 mole per mole of alpha olefinic feed is disclosed as desirable.The disclosure and teaching is directed to hydroformylation with ligands that may be a tertiary organo phosphorus compound, a tertiary organo arsenic compound or a tertiary organo antimony compound. The disclosure equates ligands containing phosphorus, arsenic and antimony and also equates trialkyl phosphite, tricycloalkyl phosphite, triaryl phosphite and triaryl phosphine ligands.Disclosure of the Invention Now it has been found that the hydroformylation reaction of cyclic acrolein acetals can be advan tageously conducted at rhodium concentrations of 1 50 ppm based on the starting acetal under the conditions of the process of this invention. Accordingly, the process of this invention is an improvement in the hydroformylation of cyclic acrolein acetals to the corresponding aldehydes in the presence of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, rhodium complex catalyst and an organo phosphorus ligand wherein the improvement comprises conducting said process in the presence of an amount of rhodium complex catalyst equivalent to from 1 50 ppm of rhodium based on the cyclic acetal, a ratio of H2 to CO of from 1 1 20 1, a CO partial pressure of from 5 20 psia, 1 3 by weight based on the cyclic acetal of excess triphenyl phosphite ligand and at a temperature of from 100 1150C. The process of the present invention maximizes the ratio of linear to branched chain aldehyde and minimizes the rhodium level required for the process without the reaction rate decrease that occurs with other ligands. At the preferred rhodium level of 1 10 ppm, the economic incentive to recover rhodium from the process is not sufficient to justify recovery of the rhodium. The cyclic acrolein acetals of this invention are defined as cyclic acrolein acetals of alkane diols and are represented by the formulaeEMI3.1 where Rl and R2 are selected from the group consisting of H and alkyl groups of 1 4 carbon atoms. PreferablyR1 and R2 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl groups of 1 2 carbon atoms. R1 andR2 can be the same or different alkyl groups. Representative examples of the cyclic acrolein acetals of this invention include 2 vinyl 5methyl 1,3 dioxane VMD , 2 vinyl 4 methyl 1,3 dioxane VMD , 2 vinyl 5,5 dimethyl 1,3 dioxane, 2 vinyl 4,4,6trimethyl 1,3 dioxane, 2 vinyl 1,3 dioxane, 2 vinyl1,3 dioxolane, 2 vinyl 4 methyl 1,3 dioxolane and 2 vinyl 4 , 5 dimethyl l , 3 dioxolane. The cyclic acrolein acetals of this invention may be prepared as taught in U.S. Patent 4,024,159 which is hereby incorporated by reference. In the process of the present invention linear aldehydes of 80 mole percent or more, preferably 85 mole percent or more, based on the combined linear and branched chain aldehydes are obtained. The attainment of linear aldehydes amounting to 80 mol percent or more of the aldehydes produced is achieved together with shorter reaction times than that attained when other ligands are substituted for the ligand of the invention. Rhodium, the catalyst, is present during the process of the invention in the form of a complex catalyst with carbon monoxide and triphenyl phosphite ligand. Rhodium complex catalyst as used herein means a coordination compound formed by the union of one or more electronically rich molecules or atoms capable of independent existence with one or more electronically poor molecules or atoms, each of which are also capable of independent existence. Said catalyst is a combination of rhodium, carbon monoxide and ligand and can be formed from rhodium carbonyl and the ligand indicated herein. The rhodium complex catalyst can be formed in situ when rhodium in the form of Rh6 CO 16 is added to the hydroformylation reaction containing the ligand of the invention or it can be prepared first and then added to the reaction mixture. The rhodium complex catalyst of the present invention is a homogeneous catalyst solution comprising rhodium and ligands complexed with carbon monoxide through coordinate bonding. The rhodium catalyst may be employed on a finely divided form and dispersed in and throughout the reaction mixture, or it may be employed in a more massive state, either in essentially the pure state or supported upon or carried by an inert or catalytically active support or carrier material, such as pumice kieselguhr, diatomaceous earth, clay, alumina, charcoal, carbon, or the like, and the reaction mixture contacted therewith as by flowing the mixture over or through a bed of the catalyst or according to other methods that are known in the art. The process of the present invention is conducted at a pressure of carbon monoxide of from 520 psia. At said carbon monoxide pressures, the pressure of hydrogen would range from 5 400 psia. When the pressure of carbon monoxide is above 20 psia, the ratio of linear to branched chain aldehyde is less than 80 .When the carbon monoxide partial pressure is below 5 psia, the gas composition is such that too much hydrogenation at the expense of hydroformylation will occur, thereby inflicting a yield loss on the aldehyde formed.Additionally, the pressure range of the process of the present invention at the rhodium range permits satisfactory reaction rates. Reaction rate is first order to the hydrogen concentration in the liquid reaction medium. The hydrogen concentration in the liquid is proportional to the partial pressure of hydrogen. Therefore, the reaction rate is first order to the hydrogen partial pressure. Surprisingly the hydroformylation process of the present invention results in a significantly faster reaction rate than that where ligands other than those of the present invention are used. The process of the present invention achieves this at rhodium levels of from 1 50 ppm rhodium based on the starting acetal.At the preferred rhodium level of 1 10 ppm, commercial operation at the conditions of this invention are not only achieved at faster reaction rates than with other ligands, but are also economically feasible without a rhodium recovery operation based on the starting cyclic acetal. The process of this invention not only results in faster reaction rates than that where other ligands are used, but also results in a ratio of linear to branched chain aldehyde of 80 or more. The reaction rates with the ligand of the invention vary, buvr generally are in the range of, e.g., about 1.5 80 hours based on 100 conversion of VMD. The ligand of the present invention is critical and is limited to triphenyl phosphite. Under the present conditions reactions with other ligands are not as fast as they are with triphenyl phosphite. Thus, the use of triphenyl phosphite under the conditions of this invention result in a faster reaction rate than other ligands. The excess ligand concentration in the process of this invention of from 1 3 by weight based on the cyclic acetal is critical. An excess ligand concentration of below 1 by weight reduces the ratio of linear to branched chain aldehyde below 80 . An excess ligand concentration above 3 by weight seriously reduces the rate of reaction. What is meant by excess ligand concentration is that amount of ligand in excess over that required to form the rhodium complex catalyst. The temperatures at which the process of this invention are conducted may range from 100 1150C, preferably 105 110 C. At a temperature above 115 C, the formation of high boilers increases above desirable levels. The present process may be operated batchwise or continuously in conventional equipment having agitation means sufficient to provide uniform mixing of reactants. The process of the present invention is useful in the preparation of cyclic acrolein acetal aldehydes that are useful intermediates for the production of 1,4 butanediol which is useful as a solvent and a resin intermediate. The gas mole ratio of H2 CO may be in the range of from 1 1 20 1. However, at lower rhodium levels, the gas mole ratio is generally from 2 1 20 1.For example, at the preferred level of 1 10 ppm rhodium the required H2 CO ratio is 2 1 20 1.BEST MODE The best mode for carrying out the invention is illustrated in Example 1.
