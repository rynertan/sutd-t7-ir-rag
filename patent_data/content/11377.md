# Photoelectric densitometer head.

## Abstract
An optical densitometer head adapted for application to automatic equipment, and not requiring manual adjustment of filters, comprises a housing 11 including a light source 13 , a lens system 15,17 and three photo electric devices 29,33 , each with its own colour filter 25,27 . Infra red filters may be included. The outputs from the devices may be applied to a three channel amplifier 37 with a characteristic so as to give outputs corresponding to the densities of the three primary colours. The devices may be symmetrically disposed in the housing, and an inspection aperture, normally closed by a plug may be provided.
