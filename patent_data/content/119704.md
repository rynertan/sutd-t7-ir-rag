## Description
METHOD OF ENHANCING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BIOCIDES The present invention relates to a method of enhancing the effectiveness of chemicals which show biocidal or bacteriostatic activity in the control of microbiological contamination. The control of water quality is of prime importance in helping prevent subterranean formation damage during introduction of aqueous based stimulation fluids. One of the parameters that can have a serious effect on water quality is microbial, that is, bacterial contamination. Bacteria can contribute in several ways to formation damage. The injection of bacterial cells into oil field waters can result in formation permeability reduction of 90 to 95 percent. Bacteria can be responsible for the production of substantial quantities of particulate matter that can cause even more pronounced reductions in the permeability of porous media than the bacterial biomass alone. An example of particulate generation produced by bacterial corrosion is the oxidation of iron to ferrous ions which produces iron sulfide and iron carbonate in the presence of hydrogen sulfide and carbonate, respec tively. Bacteria also can be a source of many corrosion problems in producing wells. Sulfate reducing bacteria are a major source of hydrogen sulfide gas and can initiate corrosion or pitting of metal surfaces. The direct effects of uncontrolled bacteria are readily seen in holding tanks containing biodegradable polymer solutions for such uses ds polymer flooding operations and hydraulic fracturing treatment. Under suitable conditions of pH and tem perature, the microbial population can multiply rapidly, utilizing the available polymer or other additives as a source of nutrition. In this event, the bacteria may alter the rheological properties of the viscous polymer solutions by fluid degradation and thereby alter the sweep efficiency of a polymer flood or the expected fracture geometry in a hydraulic fracturing treatment. The effective control of microorganisms requires the application of a suitable biocide in an appropriate amount to a fluid having microbial contamination. The surprising discovery now has been made that the use of a quantity of a cationic perfluoro compound as hereinafter described, which itself exhibits little bactericidal activity, together with a conventional biocide,results in a composition which is significantly more effective than the biocide alone. The use of the cationic perfluoro compound of the present invention together with a biocide permits a smaller quantity of biocide to be used in the treatment of a microbial contamination while still maintaining the same relative level of effectiveness as a larger quantity of biocide. According to the invention, there is provided a method of increasing the effectiveness of a biocide upon bacteria, which comprises contacting said bacteria with a quantity of a biocide and an effective amount of at least one biocidal activity enhancing cationic perfluoro compound, said cationic perfluoro compound s being selected from the compounds represented by the formula EMI3.1 wherein x is an integer from 2 to 12 or an integer or fractional integer representing an average value of from 2 to 12 w and y are both individual integers from 0 to 20 or integers or fractional integers representing average values of from 0 to 20 z is an integer from 0 to 20 or an integer or fractional integer representing an average value of from 0 to 20, the sum of y and z being from 1 to 20 R is a hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or propyl radical A is a halogen chosen from chlorine, bromine or iodine and Q is a cationic nitrogen radical from the group consisting of an aromatic amino radical, a heterocyclic amino radical, and an amine radical represented by the formula EMI4.1 wherein R1,R2 and R3 are from the group consisting of hydrocarbon radicals containing from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, aromatic hydrocarbon radicals such as phenyl and any alkyl substituted phenyl radical, and hydrogen radicals, provided that at least one of R1,R2 and R3 is an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical containing from 1 to 30 carbon atoms or an aromatic hydrocarbon and that when any one of R1, R2 and R3 radicals contains more than four aliphatic carbon atoms or an aromatic hydrocarbon, the other two radicals are each chosen from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl and ethyl radicals.

The biocides comprised a N,N,N trihydroxyethyltrihydro triazine and b dibromonitrilopropionamide. A sample of contaminated water was prepared by admixing pseudomonas with the water in an amount sufficient to provide a concentration of 2 x 106 microorganisms per milliliter of water. Quantities of the biocides and cationic perfluoro compound then were admixed with samples of the contaminated water as indicated in Table I below TABLE ICationic PerfluoroMicroorganisms Biocide a Biocide b CompoundTest per ml. l. 1000 l. Water l. 1000 l.

The concentration is determined based on the quantitative measurement of adenosine triphosphate ATP in the sample. ATP is a nucleotide found in all forms of life.Bacteria possess on the average 1 x 10 15 gm of ATP per organism 1 x 10 9 micrograms ATP per organism . The concentration of organisms per ml. is determined by dividing the ATP concentration by 1 x 10 9. To measure the ATP, the bacteria is contacted with a cell wall lysing agent to liberate the ATP. The released ATP then is reacted with the chemical luciferin in the presence of the enzyme luciferass, Mg 2 and oxygen to produce light. A photometer is used to measure the amount of light which is expressed in relative light units. The relative light units are proportional to the amount of ATP in the sample. By reference to a standard curve of ATP concentration versus relative light units, the concentration of ATP and organisms per ml. can be determined See Figure .For a further explanation of ATP photometry methods, see the article entitled ATP Determination with FireflyLuciferase by Leach, Franklin, J. Appl. Biochemistry, 3, 473 571 1981 , the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The N,N,N trihydroxyethyltrihydrotriazine, by itself, did not reduce the microorganism count to a level below 105 organisms per ml. within two hours. However, when combined with the cationic perfluoro compounds of the present invention, the microorganism count was reduced to less than 103 organisms per ml. within two hours.Similarly, the dibromonitriloproprionamide only reduced the microorganism count to 104 organisms per ml. after two hours, but, in combination with the cationic perfluoro compound of the present invention, the microorganism count was reduced to less than 103 organisms per ml. in less than 30 minutes.
