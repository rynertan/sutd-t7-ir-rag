# A chin strap and a crash helmet.

## Abstract
The chin strap is effective to be attached with one end to a projection 3 inside a crash helmet by means of a buckle 4 , the snap fastener consisting of a receptacle 8 formed directly in the helmet outer shell 2 , whereto a lever 10 actuated dog 12 , is pinned pivotally to allow a second buckle 15 to be locked thereby. The strap snap fastener 9 is fastened with the inter mediary of a flat spring 16 .

## Description
This invention relates to an improved snap fastenable chin strap. for crash helmets. Crash helmets, and in particular head enclosing helmets for motorcyclists, are equipped with a chin strap to secure the helmet in a reliable manner to the motorcyclist s head. Such chin straps are usually formed in two parts, which are interconnected by a strap fastening device. Conventional chin strap fastening devices are, however, inconvenient to use in that both hands have to be used to operate them. An added source of inconvenience comes from the actuation itself of such prior fasteners which, being generally small in size, are not easily controlled to fasten and release the chin strap. Thas the task of this invention is to provide a chin strap which can overcome the problems and limitations affecting comparable prior devices. Within this task it is an object of the invention to provide a chin strap which is a single pce construction with connection devices which are directly associated with the helmet structure. A further object of the invention is to provide a connection device which can be readily operated with one hand. The abve task and objects as well as yet other objects, such as will be apparent hereinafter, are achieved by an improved snap chin strap for crash helmets, characterized in that it comprises a chin strap formed as a single piece, one end of said chin strap being effective to be secured to a projection provided on the helmet shell inside, and the other end thereof carrying a buckle adapted to engage with a snap fastening device formed directly and enclosed in a receptacle on said helmet shell. Further features and advantages of the invention will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment thereof, given herein by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, where Figure 1 is a partly sectional view of a crash helmet showing the attachment of the chin strap fixed end to the helmet shell Figure 2 is a sectional view through the attachment of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a partly sectional view showing the area of the helmet shell with the snap fastening device Figure 4 is a side view of the snap fastening device Figure 5 is a sectional view of the inventive snap fastening device taken along the line V V ofFigure 4 and Figure 6 is a sectional view of the snap fastening device taken along the line VI VI of Figure 4. With reference to the drawing illustrations, on the inside area or interior of a motorcyclist helmet 1, a projection 3 is molded, on one side of the shell 2, which is intended to accommodate a buckle 4 associated with a first end of the strap 5. In order to retain at all times the connection between the buckle 4 and projection 3, a snap ring 6, of the so called seeger typ4isforcefittedonthelatter With such a connection device, which is fully enclosed within the helmet inner liner 7, no throughgoing locking rivets need be provided. On the opposed side of the helmet shell 2, a receptacle 8 is formed which opens outwardly and is intended for containing the snap fastening device 9. Said device comprises a lever 10 secured to the walls of the receptacle 8 by means of a pivot pin 11. The lever 10 is provided, at the middle area thereof, with a tooth or dog 12 which engages in a seat or opening formed onabla i ke ilig 14. of a second, adjustable buckle 15, which is provided at the free end of the chin strap 5. The engagement pressure for the dog 12 is supplied by a flat spring 16 acting on two cams 17, formed laterally on the lever 10. In practice, by pulling the lever 10 outwards, the buckle 15 is released and the spring 16 deflected, which tends to return the lever 10 to its engagement position aligned with the shell 2o To engage, it will be sufficient to push on the buckle 10 and insert the blade like lug 14 under the dog 12, which has a suitably sloping configuration of its leading corner edge 1 8, until the dog 12 snaps into the seat 13. Lt will be appreciated from the foregoing description that this chin strap can be fastened and unfastened in a most quick manner using one hand to act on either the buckle or lever. The helmet shell has no outward projections nor any rivets or other mechanical means of attachment. The chin strap is a single piece construction with buckles only provided at its ends. There is no potential hazard for the user because all the projections are contained within the inner liner area. Based on this same inventive concept, other embodiments of the invention are possible without departing from the protection scope of this application. Of course, the materials and dimensions may be selected to meet individual requirements.
