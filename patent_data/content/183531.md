# PORTABLE BENDING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A portable bending apparatus 1 for bending elongate, deformable material 2 , comprises first and second clamps 3 , 4 adapted, in use, to be located in a selected, spaced apart relationship along a length of material 2 to be bent, each clamp 3 , 4 providing a fixed jaw 8 adapted, in use, to engage one side of the material 2 to be bent in the plane in which bending is required, and pivotably carrying a lever 13 having lever portions 15 , 18 extending to opposite sides of a laterally spaced, lever pivot axis 14 , with a first lever portion 15 provided with a jaw 16 adapted to engage the opposite side of the material 2 to be bent in the plane in which bending is required, and with a second lever portion 18 providing a pivotal attachment point 21 for power means extending between the levers and hence between the clamps for imposing bending moments on the material to be bent via the clamps, the power means comprising a double acting, hydraulic piston and cylinder unit 5 .
