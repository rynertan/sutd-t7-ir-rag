## Description
A plough The invention relates to a plough comprising a frame and at least one plough body connected to this frame. With ploughs of this type the plough bodies have mouldboard shapes adapted to the specific types of soil.This implies that a specific plough must be purchased for a specific type of soil. Using the construction according to the invention, provisions have now been made with the aid whereof the shape of the mouldboard can be modified such that the plough body can be used for a plurality of soil types. According to the invention, this is accomplished in that the plough body includes a mouldboard consisting of at least two portions which are arranged pivotably relative to each other. Using this construction, the shape of the mouldboard and consequently the guide the mouldboard constitutes for the cut out furrow slice can be changed. As a result thereof not only the shape of the mouldboard can be adapted to the soil type, but it is at the same time possible to obtain an adaption to the intended ploughing rate. A further aspect of the invention relates to a plough in which the plough body comprises a two portion mouldboard, which portions are each disposed around a different, vertically extending shaft, capable of adjustment.Using this construction, the resistance experienced by a plough body during its travel through the soil can be influenced, that is to say it is always possible to obtain such a position of the mouldboard that the resistance during travel of the plough body through the soil is at a minimum. A further aspect of the invention relates to a plough in which the plough body comprises a mouldboard having an upper portion which is adjustable to two or a plurality of positions around a vertically extending shaftUsing this construction the soil turning up action of the plough body can be influenced and thus an adaptation to the desired plough action is obtained. A further aspect of the invention relates to a plough in which the plough body comprises a mouldboard having a portion which is pivotable around a shaft arranged near the plough share. Because the shaft is provided before a mouldboard portion is pivoted, it is achieved that on readjusting the mouldboard the bottom of the mouldboard does substantially not change relative to the share, which is of utmost importance for guiding the furrow slice. Another aspect of the invention relates to a plough comprising at least one plough body having a mouldboard provided with an extension which is arranged capable of adjustment around an upwardly directed shaft. With the aid of the extension the guiding surface of the mouldboard can be increased, all this such that on swivelling the mouldboard or mouldboard portions, respectively, to the rear a forward motion of the extension is produced, causing the overall mouldboard surface area to be increased. A further aspect of the invention relates to a plough in which two plough bodies can be returned to the operating position by means of one spring which has one end connected to the frame of the plough. Using this construction it is not only possible, with one single spring, to obtain a compact feature, but at the same time a cheap feature A still further aspect of the invention relates to a plough in which there is provided for a plough a springloaded construction and means which are subjected to a tensile load and cooperate with the spring loaded construction, all this such that in the overload condition a tensile force is exerted on one tensile load subjectable means. When such a construction is used, only one specific part of the tensile load subjectable means is additionally loaded on deflection of a plough body. A last aspect of the invention relates to a plough having a plough body for which a spring loaded construction and a bendable pull rod are present. With the aid of this feature it is possible to realise an effective guide means for the motion a plough body makes during deflection in the overload condition. The invention will now be described by way of example in greater detail with reference to an embodiment shown in the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 is a plan view of a plough having a construction according to the invention. Figure 2 illustrates on an enlarged scale a side elevational view of a plough body having a construction according to the invention. Figure 3 is a view taken in the direction of the arrow III in Figure 2. Figure 4 illustrates on an enlarged scale a plan view of the foremost portion of the plough shown in Figure 1. Figure 5 illustrates on an enlarged scale a view taken in the direction of the line V V in Figure 4, whilst Figure 6 is a view along the line VI VI in Figure 4. The arrangement shown in the Figures is a soil tilling machine, more specifically a reversible plough, comprising a main frame beam 1 which is inclined at an angle to the direction of operative travel A, which beam is located at least substantially horizontally. The main frame beam 1 has a U shaped portion 2, which is made from plate material and is situated such that the legs of the U extend at least substantially in the horizontal direction. At the ends the legs are partially bent through a square angle andbolted by means of bolts 3 to an upwardly extending plate 4 Figures 4 and 5 . Plate shaped supports 5 are fastened equidistantly from each other to the main frame beam 1. As will be apparent from Figure 4, the foremost support 5 is disposed at the front end of the main frame beam l, whilst the rear support is disposed with some spacing before the end of the main frame beam l. An at least substantially horizontal shaft 6, which extends transversely of the direction of operative travel A is bolted to each of the plate shaped supports 5 by means of the bolts 3 against the plate 4 of the main frame beam 1 Figure 5 . At some distance from the plate shaped support 5 a carrier 7 is pivotably arranged on the shaft 6. The carrier 7 extends rearwardly and at least substantially parallel with the direction of operative travel A and, during normal operation, is in at least substantially horizontal position.The carrier 7 which, as can be seen fromFigure 5, is hollow and has a rectangular cross section, is fastened in the region of the shaft 6 to a support 8 which is also secured at its upper and lower sides by means of a bracing plate 9A Figure 4 At its upper and lower sides the support 8 has a stud 9 which extends in the direction of the main frame beam 1 and is arranged parallel with the shaft 6. Around each of the studs 9 a rod 10 is provided freely rotatable, which rod extends mainly parallel with the carrier 7 Figure 6 . Each of the rods 10 has a foremost strip shaped portion 11 which near the centre of the rod is arranged hingeably between two strips of a portion 13 by means of a pin 12, which extends parallel to the studs 9 Each portion 3 is swivably connected by means of its near end with the aid of a pin 14, which also extends at least substantially parallel with the stud 9, to a furcate portion 15, which is disposed between the strip of the portion 13 by means of the pin 14 and a lug. By means of a common shaft 16, which extends at least substantially in the vertical direction, the furcate portions 15 are rotatably disposed on an arm 17.The arm 17 is fastened by means of its other end via a furcate portion and a pin 18, which extends at least substantially in the vertical direction, to a lug 19, which is bolted to the plate 4 of the main frame beam 1 by means of the bolts 3. Between the furcate portions 15, around the shaft 16, one end of a leaf spring 20 is folded, the widest side extending upwardly, and which with its other end is provided around an at least substantially vertical shaft 21, which is disposed between lugs 22 on a support 5. The leaf spring 20, which is pretensioned, tries to keep the portions of the rods 10 and, consequently, the carrier 7 in a position as shown in Figure 6. In this position a stop 23 constituted by an adjustable bolt and disposed on the portion 13 bears against the portion 11 of a rod 10 by means of a support 24 on the portion 13. The rods 10 and the spring 20 constitute an overload protection mechanism which keeps the carrier 7, on which two plough bodies 25 are provided one above the other, in a neutral position, swivelling of the carrier 7 around the shaft 6 being counteracted by the springs 20 and the rods 10 both being submitted to a tensile load. At its ends, each support 7 includes a downwardly inclined and forwardly extending or upwardly inclined and forwardly extending, respectively, straight arm 26, which at the end remote from the support 7 carries the plough body 25 Figure 2 . Each plough body 25 includes a support 27 which extends in the direction of operative travel A of the plough and is constituted by an angle iron. The angle iron is provided such that one side is located against the exterior side of the arm 26 and the bottom side bears on the lower end of the said arm.The support 27 serves at the same time as a landside and to that purpose is provided at its rear side with a wearing plate 28 in front of which a shield strip 29 is provided which has for its object to prevent the material from tucking up. Both the raised edge and the horizontal edge of the support 27 are bevelled at their front ends, in such a way that this creates a fastening feature for a share 30, whose width decreases in the direction from the connection to the support to its end remote from the angle iron Figure 3 and whose front extends rearwardly at an angle of 1 S0O relative to the direction of operative travel A. A mouldboard 31 is contiguous to the share 30. The mouldboard 31 has a lower portion 32 which at its end facing the support 27 is provided at the rear with a plate 33, which is fastened by means of bolts 32A.The plate 33 is provided on the upper side of a bushing 34, which bushing is freely rotatable around a shaft 35 fastened to the horizontal leg of the angle iron support 27 and extends at least substantially vertically. Above the rearwardly extending leg of the angleiron support 27 a strip is disposed which, in a plan view, extends at least substantially straight and constitutes a soil crusher 36. The said strip slightly tapers from the front to the rear. At its front end located before the share 30r the soil crusher 36 has a cutting edge and, in a side view Figure 3 follows the variation of the foremost upright side of the share and the mouldboard portion 32. The top end of the soil crusher 36 extends to above the upper side of the mouldboard portion 32. The soil crusher 36 also constitutes a shield, behind which shield the mouldboard portion 32 is swivable by means of the bush 34 around the shaft 35 by means of an adjusting arrangement to be further described hereinafter.An upper portion 37 of the mouldboard 31, which portion extends at least substantially parallel with the upper edge of the mouldboard portion 32 and is fastened by means of a support 38 to the soil crusher 36 and to the support 26, connects up with the upper side of the soil crusher 36 The upper mouldboard portion 37 includes a portion which is contiguous to the soil crusher 36 and by means of an at least substantially vertically positioned hinge pin 39 is connected to a portion having a length of approximately twice the length of the first mentioned portion. In a plan view, the mouldboard portion 37 extends through approximately two thirds of the length of the upper side of the mouldboard portion 32. An extension 42 for the mouldboard 31 is provided at the free end of the mouldboard portion 32 by means of supports 40 and a shaft 41 which extends in the upward, preferably vertical, direction. As will be obvious fromFigure 2, the extension 42 is predominantly rectangular, tapering somewhat to the free end and having bevelled corners. For the purpose of readjusting the portions 32 and 37 and the extension 42 constituting the mouldboard 31, an adjusting mechanism located predominantly in the region of the upper side of the mouldboard portion 32 and provided at the rear side of the arm 26 is provided for each plough body 25. To this end, the rear side of the arm 26 is provided with a lug 43. An upwardly, preferably vertically extending shaft 45 is supported in the lug 43 by means of a bushing 44. Under the bushing 44 an arm 46 which extends in an at least horizontal direction and is formed by two superjacent strips is disposed around the shaft 45. The arm 46 is swivably connected by means of its other end via a stud 47, which extends in an at least substantially vertical direction, to an arm 48 disposed between the strips.The arm 48 has its other end swivably arranged between two lugs 50 at the rear of the bottom mouldboard portion 32, by means of an upwardly, preferably vertically extending stud 49.Above the bushing 44, on the shaft 45, an arm 51 is disposed which by means of its other end is disposed capable of swivelling by means of an upwardly extending, at least substantially vertically located pin 52 between two lugs 53, which are fastened to the rear of the extension near the shaft 41 around which the extension 42 is swivable Figure 3 . An intermediate arm 55 is disposed, capable of swivelling, at some distance from the shaft 45 by means of an upwardly, preferably vertically extending pin 54. By means of a pin 56, which also extends at least substantially in the vertical direction, the intermediate arm 55 is fastened capable of swivelling to a lug 57 located at the rear side of the swivable portion of the upper portion 37 of the mouldboard 32. The shaft 45 which constitutes a common shaft for the adjusting mechanism of a pair of plough bodies 25 is supported at that side of the carrier 7 which is remote from the main frame beam 1, by means of a bearing 58 Figures 2 and 4 . In the region of the bearing 58 the shaft 45 has an arm 59 which extends from the carrier 7 and is in an at least substantially horizontal position.By means of an at least substantially vertical pin 60 the arm 59 is swivably connected to a rod 61, which extends in the forward direction along the carrier 7 By means of a pin 62 which extends parallel with the shaft 6, the front end of the rod 61 is hingeably connected to an upwardly extending lever 63. At the upper side the lever 63 is fastened to one end of a shaft 64. The shaft 64 is positioned parallel or substantially parallel with the shafts 9 and is supported on the shaft 6 by means of an arm 65. Near its other end, the shaft 64 is supported in a bushing 66 which constitutes a passage for an upwardly extending lug 67 which is bolted by means of the bolts 3 to those ends of the U shaped portion 2 of the main frame beam 1 remote from the plate 5. The relevant end of the shaft 64 has an arm 58 which extends downwardly and is connected via a pin 69 which extends parallel with the shafts 6 and 64, to a track rod 70 extending along the upper side of the main frame beam 1.The track rod 70 is connected between the second and third pairs of plough bodies to a hydraulic adjusting cylinder 71, which can be connected to the hydraulic circuit of the tractor via ducts, not further shown, and is operable from the tractor. The plough has a frame 72 which is hitchable to a tractor. The frame 72 includes a frame portion constituted by an, in plan view, triangular frame. The frame includes a transverse beam 73 which is located at least substantially horizontally and extends at least substantially perpendicularly to the direction of operative travel A. The transverse beam 73 comprises a plate material, U shaped portion 74, whose legs extend forwardly and are bent through right angles at the ends Figure 4 . The bent portions of the legs are provided capable of sliding by means of an upwardly directed plate which is movable along a plate 75 and strips 76 fastened to the upper and lower sides of this plate. By means of bolts the strips 76 and the plate 75 are bolted to an upwardly directed plate 77 located at the end of the transverse beam, facing the main frame beam.The other end of the transverse beam 73 has at its rear side a beam 78 extending in the direction of operative travel A. The rear end of the beam 78 is connected by means of a connecting beam 79 to a point at the rear of the transverse beam 73, located near the other end. The plate 77 located at the front side of the transverse beam 73 is provided near its rear end, considered in the direction of operative travel A, with a horizontal shaft 80, which shaft extends in the direction of operative travel A and is rotatably supported in bearings 81 fastened to a trestle 82 which comprises a three point connection for linkage to the three point linking arrangement of a tractor Figure 4 . An adjusting cylinder 83 which extends in the longitudinal direction of the beam is arranged in the transverse beam 73.The adjusting cylinder 83 is operable from the tractor and has one end connected capable of hinging to a support at the rear side of the plate 75. The other end of the adjusting cylinder 83 is disposed on a support located within the transverse beam 73. By means of ducts, not further shown, the adjusting cylinder 83 can be connected to the hydraulic circuit of a tractor. In two points which are located one behind the other, the main frame beam 1 is hingeably connected to the frame 72. The foremost hinge point is formed by a hinge pin 84 with the aid of which a lug 85 is disposed near the front end of the connecting beam 79 between two lugs 86, which are located one above the other on the main frame beam 1. The second hinge point is located just before the centre of the main frame beam 1 and is constituted by a hinge pin 87 which connects a lug 88 on the main frame beam to a connecting arm 89. By means of a shaft 90, the connecting arm 89 is hingeably provided between the ends of an arm 91, more specifically before the rear end at 1 5 of the length of the arm 91.The rear end of the arm 91 is swivably fastened by means of a shaft 92 to the upper side of the beam 78 in the region of the rear end of this beam. The front end of the arm 91 is hingeably connected by means of a shaft 93 to a bushing in which a threaded spindle 94 is rotatable. The threaded spindle 94 has one end disposed swivably between lugs 95 which are located one above the other and are disposed at the rear side of the transverse beam 73. With the aid of the shaft 80 the plough which, as mentioned in the foregoing, is a reversible plough can be adjusted to two working positions by means of a known reversing mechanism, not further shown, in which working positions the plough bodies 25 of the respective pairs are alternately operative.The rear end of the main frame beam 1 is provided with a support 96 which has a shaft which extends transversely of the direction of operative travel A and around which an arm 97 is swivable, which in a working position of the plough is directed at a downward angle and to the rear and bears a groundwheel 98, all this such that the groundwheel can assume two positions in which this groundwheel contacts the ground during the above mentioned working positions of the plough. The afore described plough operates a follows. During operation the plough is connected to the arms of the three point lifting arrangement of the tractor by means of the coupling portion comprising the trestle 82 and the plate 75 and, if it assumes a position as illustrated in Figure 1, the plough can be moved in a direction as indicated by arrow A. Then the furrow slices shown in the Figure are turned over to the right by the operative plough bodies 25. In the working position shown, the lower arms of the lever arrangement are in a position in which they are substantially symmetrical relative to a vertical plane in the direction of operative travel A and through a point in the centre of the rear axle of the tractor. The point of intersection of the extension of the relevant arms, which constitutes the ideal drawing point, is then also located substantially in this plane, as is also the point at which the tractive force of the plough acts.The resistance line interconnecting the two points then extends through the centre of the rear axle, so that the tractor is controllable to the maximum extent. If, from the working position shown in Figure 1, the frame 72 with the main frame beam 1 and the pairs of plough bodies 75 connected thereto are moved to the right by means of the hydraulical adjusting cylinder 83 relative to the direction of operative travel A and the coupling portion connected to the tractor, the main frame beam 1 is moved such thanks to the hinging connection between the main frame beam 1 and the frame 72, which hinging connection includes the hinge points located in succession and formed by the at least substantially vertical shafts 84 and 87, relative to the frame 72 and relative to the direction of operative travel A, that the resistance line is moved in like measure to the left, causing this resistance line to continue to extent at least substantially through the centre of the tractor rear axle.When the frame is moved to the right, the arm 91 moves ouwards, the hinge point formed by the shaft 87 being moved to the left with the aid of the connecting arm 89, as a result of which the main frame beam 1 swivels to the left around the hinge point formed by the shaft 84, the intended movement of the resistance line thus being obtained. The above mentioned displacement is usually effected to obtain an appropriate adaption of the position of the foremost plough body to the track width of the tractor. At a maximum displacement to the right of 40 cms the plough is adjustable to a position in which the foremost plough body 6 is placed behind the tractor wheel, that is to say in the open furrow. Then the plough is only loaded by means of the reaction forces acting on two plough bodies.In this case the point at which the tractive force acts becomes located between the two plough bodies. Also then when the frame 72 is moved, the main frame beam 1 is so displaced relative to the frame that the resistance line extends at least substantially through the centre of the rear axle of the tractor. Slight corrections on the variation of the resistance line can be obtained by rotating the threaded spindle 94, which causes the arm 91 to swivel around the hinge pin 92 and a slight readjustment of the main frame beam 1 is obtained with the aid of the connecting arm 89. As has already been mentioned in the foregoing, during operation the carrier 7 for the plough bodies 25 is kept in an at least substantially horizontal working position by means of the rods 10 which are acted upon by the spring 20 and are subjected to a tensile load. If during operation the operative plough body 25 hits an obstacle the carrier 7 and, consequently, the plough body 6 can deflect upwards around the shaft 6 to prevent damage. In this situation the portions 11 and 13 of the upper rod 10 are bent upwardly around the pin 12 against the action of the spring 20, so that a tensile load is only exerted on the lower rod 10 and the plough body can get loose from the obstacle whereafter it can quickly return to its original working position, the portions of the upper rod returning to their original position under the action of the spring 20. During travel of the plough an advantageous cutting of the furrow slice and a flow of this furrow slice along the share 30 on the mouldboard 31 is obtained by means of the soil crusher member 36 located at the front side of each plough body 25. The mouldboard portions 32 and 37 may then be caused to assume a position illustrated in Figure 3, the extension assuming the substantially inoperative position, shown in the Figure, parallel with the direction of operative travel A. However, the position of the mouldboard portions can be changed by rearwardly swivelling the mouldboard portions for each plough body from the position shown around the shafts 35 and 39, using the adjusting cylinder 71, the track rod 70 and the adjusting mechanisms described in the foregoing. This may, for example, be desired when heavy soil is ploughed or if a higher speed of ploughing is required. When the respective mouldboard portions are moved to the rear, the extension 42 starts to advance from the position shown, as a result of which this extension will gradually participate in guiding a furrow slice. When the mouldboard portions are swivelled rearwardly to their maximum extent, the extension arrives completely in the extension of the mouldboard plane, causing this plane to be increased to its maximum, for example, when the heaviest types of soil are ploughed. By readjusting the upper mouldboard portion 37 it is also possible to influence reversing of the cut out furrow slice. Since the shaft 35 for swivelling the lower mouldboard portion 32 is directly located behind the share 30, the position of the mouldboard portion does substantially not change when it is swivelled around the shaft.
