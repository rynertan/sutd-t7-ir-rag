# Method for manufacturing an electrochromic display device.

## Abstract
An electrochromic display matrix and method for making the same are disclosed wherein relatively small spacing distances between the individual electrochromic elements can be obtained. The method comprises exposing and developing photoresist through a pattern which defines strips and relatively narrow spacing distances. Solvent permeable ion conductive material and then solvent permeable conductive material are applied over the photoresist. Photoresist solvent remover is then applied, which releases the underlying photoresist and lifts off the ion conductive material and conductive material to estab lish isolated regions of ion conductive material and conduc tive material. Insulating paint is then applied in order to maintain isolation between the strips. The completed de vice, when addressed by a multiplexing method, is substan tially free of any cross talk effects. High resolution display matrices are obtainable.
