## Description
INFRARED ABSORBING INKS This invention relates to inks and more particularly to infrared absorbing inks suitable for use in ink jet printers. Bar coding has become a standard means for inventory control of a variety of commodities and for ease of updating pric es. Bar codes are often applied by ink jet printers. Such ink jet printers are well known. In general they comprise ink jet orifices means for delivering an ink composition to the ori fices and means for causing the ink composition to emerge from the orifices in an imagewise pattern. The bar codes are printed on a variety of substrates such as paper, cardboard, plastic, glass, glossy labels, and other kinds of commercial packaging materials. For inventories of radiation sensitive materials, such as photographic paper, it is desir able to apply bar codes that can be read with radia tion that does not expose the radiation sensitive material. Nevertheless, it is desirable that such bar codes should be visible to the human eye for easy inspection of printing quality. Inks designed for use in ink jet printers must be formulated to contain sufficient dye to pro vide an optically dense bar code for easy machine, human or computer reading. U.S. Patent 3,705,043 discloses infrared absorbing ink compositions con taining nigrosine dyes. The problem is that these dyes cause the orifices of ink jet printers to clog. It is an object of the present invention to provide infrared absorbing inks which do not clog the orifices of ink jet printers. This object is achieved with an ink composition comprising a dye, a binder and a solvent blend characterized in that the composition comprises, as the dye, at least 1.0 by weight of an infrared absorbing oxoindolizinium dye. By solvent blend we mean a mixture of at least two different organic solvents. The inks of this invention are useful in ink jet printers. The inks will not clog the orifices of the jet printer. They remain stable under conditions of high temperature and high humidity. The oxoindolizinium dyes are sufficiently soluble in the selected solvents to provide a sufficiently optically dense image to be read by current machines used to read infrared printing codes. The bar codes printed with the inks are visible to the human eye.In addition, the inks of the invention possess an electrical conductivity of between 400 1000 ohm cm for proper deflection of ink drops by an electric field when discharged from the ink jet orifice a viscosity of between 2 4 MPA.s to insure good runability in the orifices of ink jet printers and a surface tension between 25 40 millinewtons meter to insure good cohesion of ink drops as they exit the jet printer orifice and good wetability of the ink on most substrates. In a preferred embodiment, the dye of the ink composition has the structureEMI2.1 wherein n is an integer of from 1 to 4 R1 and R3 each independently represent keto, hydrogen, alkyl or aryl provided that either Rl or R3 must be keto R2 , R4, R5 , R6 , R7 , R8 and Rs, each individually represents hydrogen, alkyl, alkoxy and aryl or R6 and R7 taken together with N form a fused 6 member saturated cyclic ring or R6, Rv or R8 and R9 together with N and the phenylidene group to which N is bonded form a julolidinyl ring and X represents an anion. Alkyl refers to straight or branched chain alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as methyl, butyl, neopentyl, etc. Aryl may be substituted or unsubstituted and includes phenyl, mesityl, tolyl, dimethoxyphenyl, naphthyl, t butylphenyl, methoxyphenyl, etc. The oxoindolizinium dyes useful in forming the ink compositions of the invention and methods for making such dyes are described in detail in U.S.Patent 4,368,247. In general, the dyes are formed by reaction of a photosensitive cyclopropenone with a pyridine compound and reaction of the resulting product with a color forming coupler. A portion of the representative dyes useful in the present invention are set out in Tables I andII. The dyes of Table I illustrate a tetrahydroquinoline infrared absorbing component connected to the oxoindolizinium nucleus through one or more methine linkages. Table II discloses compounds in which the infrared absorbing component is juloli dine. While these materials are exemplified inTables I and II, it will be obvious to one skilled in the art that any other infrared absorbing component can be attached to the oxoindolizinium nucleus through one or more methine linkages.Examples of other materials from which infrared absorbing components may be derived include cyanine compounds, pyrylium compounds, thiopyrylium compounds, benzothiazolium compounds and benzoselenazolium compounds.

The selected binder is stirred into the solvent blend until a clear solution is obtained. The dye is stirred into the latter solution until the dye is completely dissolved. The resulting ink is then centrifuged and or filtered to remove any suspended or particulate matter. The inks of this invention are formulated to provide compositions having at least 1 by weight of dye, preferably at least 3 by weight of dye.This amount of dye is necessary to provide a sufficient optically dense image to be read by current machines used to read infrared print codes. This amount of dye usually provides sufficient resistivity 400 600 ohm cm to provide a uniform stream in ink jet printers. The ink composition comprises up to about 5 weight percent of binder. The binder is necessary to provide ink drops with cohesion especially upon initial contact with the substrate upon which printing occurs. The binder also aids adhesion of the dye to the substrate as well as controlling the viscosity of the final ink composition. Thus, the binder must be chosen so that it is soluble in the selected solvent blend. Useful binders include cellulose esters such as cellulose acetate propionate, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate and cellulose acetate succinate. Poly vinylacetate and poly vinylbutyrol are also useful. Other useful polymers are disclosed in the ink arts such as in U.S. Patent 4,070,322. Useful solvent blends must be capable of dissolving the selected dye and binder as well as other addenda needed. to adjust the conductivity, surface tension and viscosity of the ink compositions of the present invention. The solvent blend is also designed to prevent drying out of the ink in jet printer orifices and at the same time facilitate rapid drying of the ink after printing. In general, useful solvent blends will comprise a mixture of organic liquids to accomplish these diverse ends. In general, the ink composition will comprise a from 2 to 10 weight percent of high boiling organic liquid boiling point of at least 1500C such as 4 butyrolactone, n methylpyrrolidone and cyclic ketones such as cyclohexanone or chlorinated hydrocarbons such as tetrachloroethylene b from 30 to 80 weight percent of low boiling organic liquid boiling point less than 1000C such as acetone, ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone or methylene chloride and if necessary, c from 15 to 50 weight percent of an intermediate boiling organic liquid, such as 2 methoxyethanol, 2 methoxyethylacetate, cyclopentanol or l methyl 2 chloropropanol.The intermediate boiling organic liquids are useful in optimizing the solvent blend between the properties of the high boiling organic liquid and the low boiling organic liquid. Of course, each organic liquid component of the mixture must be visible with the other organic liquid components. The solvent blend comprises from about 80 to 97 weight percent of the total ink composition. In general, inks prepared with the proportions of dye, binder and organic liquids described above will possess the required resistivity 400 1000 ohm cm surface tension 25 40 millinewtons meter and viscosity 2 4 MPa.s . As such they will work well in ink jet printers. However, if necessary, other addenda known in the ink making art may be added to the ink composition to adjust the resistivity and surface tension. The surface tension can be adjusted, when required with an anionic surfactant such as sodium alkyl sulfite, a cationic surfactant such as an alkylpyridinium sulfite salt or a nonionic surfactant such as polyoxyethylene alkyl ether. The choice of the particular material for adjusting the surface tension will be influenced by the solvent blend selected and solubility factors. The required resistivity of the ink compositions is usually provided by the selected oxoindolizinium dye. The resistivity can also be adjusted with relatively small amounts of water or an ionizable salt dissolved in water. Useful ionizable salts include dimethylamine hydrochloride, sodium propionate, sodium acetate and the like. The resistivity should generally be maintained in the range of about 400 1000 ohm cm. Of course, any of the latter resistivity modifiers must be soluble or miscible in the ink solvent mixture. The following examples are presented to illustrate the preparation and use of a variety of ink compositions included within the scope of this invention. Examples 1 4 In these examples ink compositions were prepared using a mixed solvent blend. All of the selected organic liquids were mixed together to form the solvent mixture. The binder, cellulose acetate propionate, was dissolved in the solvent mixture by stirring for about two hours until a clear solution was obtained. The selected Table I or Table II dye was then added to the solvent and stirred until the dye was completely dissolved. To remove any existing undissolved dye or polymer, the ink was centrifuged at 50,000 rpm using a 4 mm orifice and a 19 cm gum rubber hose inlet. After centrifuging, the material was filtered through a 1.5 micrometer filter. Water is used in Examples 1 and 2 to adjust the electrical resistance of the final ink composition. The prepared inks had the following compositions. Example 1 Weight Percent Cellulose Acetate Propionate 3.1 binder 4 Butyrolactone 4.7 2 Methoxyethanol 23.4 Methyl Ethyl Ketone 57.6 Dye No. 4, Table I 4.7 Distilled Water 6.5 Example 2 Weight Percent Cellulose Acetate Propionate 3.0 4 Butyrolactone 7.5 l Methoxy 2 propanol 41.0 Dye No. 6, Table I 2.5 Methyl Ethyl Ketone 40.0 Distilled Water 6.0 Example 3 Weight Percent Cellulose Acetate Propionate 3.0 4 Butyrolactone 5.0 2 Methoxyethanol 18.0 Dye No. 11, Table II 3.0 Methanol 71.0 Example 4 Weight Percent Cellulose Acetate Propionate 3.3 4 Butyrolactone 5.0 2 Methoxyethanol 25.0 Dye No. 1, Table I 5.0 Methyl Ethyl Ketone 61.7 Analysis of the above inks show Electrical resistivity 700 800 ohm cm Surface Tension 25 27 millinewton meter Viscosity 2 3 MPa.s Density 830 900 Kg m3 Solids 8.4 8.8 Each of the above ink compositions was evaluated in an A. B. Dick Model 9100 ink jet printer, modified for applying bar codes. Using the latter printer, a series of bar codes were printed on white paper stock and photographic color paper. The ink performed well in the printer. No clogging of the ink jet orifice was noted. The ink emerged from the jet orifices in a uniform steady stream. The bar codes printed with the above inks were read out with a Skan O Matic IR bar code reader having a solid state diode laser. The bar codes printed on Ektacolor paper range from 0.25 to 0.50 mm in width. The bar codes showed sufficient optical density in subdued visible light to determine their presence visually. The bar codes also possessed sufficient density in the infrared to enable bar code reading using the Skan O Matic IR bar code reader. As many as one million dots can be printed in the A. B. Dick ink jet printer with 1 cc of each of the exemplified inks.Examples 5 10 Dyes 3, 7, 9 and 8 of Table I and Dyes 15 and 17 of Table II were each formulated into ink compositions using the same solvents, binders and weight percentages of Example 1. The dyes were all found to be soluble in the solvent system of Example 1.
