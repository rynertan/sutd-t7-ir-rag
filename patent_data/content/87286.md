# Apparatus and method for tracking integrated circuit devices.

## Abstract
A plurality of carriers 2 for integrated circuit devices are each uniquely coded so as to be recognisable by an automatic decoding apparatus. The devices are tested and the test results accurately correlated with the appropriate devices by recording the test results for each device, reading the identification code for each carrier in the same sequence in which the devices are tested, and then correlating the test results with the device identifications. In one embodiment the carriers are coded by breaking a selected combination of membranes 46 blocking the transmission of light through an array of perforations 40 in each carrier.
