## Description
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION This invention relates to shower enclosures and in particular to a means for at least partially covering such shower enclosures especially when in use. It is common for showers to be provided with, or in, special enclosures such as shower boxes or housings, or alternatively to be provided in association with baths or some other base or surround. Throughout the specification and claims, these are hereinafter referred to and defined as shower enclosures . Shower enclosures used up until this time have usually had at least one open face. This is provided as an open face in a shower box or housing, and as at least one open side or both sides of a bath in connection with which a shower is mounted and used. Problems often arise from such showers, in that it is often desired to provide at least a partial covering for at least one side of such a shower enclosure to either provide privacy and or prevent water from the shower splashing or moving outside the enclosure at least as far as possible . Up until this time, numerous means have been provided for meeting this purpose, in the form for example of shower curtains, doors or partial swing doors or closures. These have all had problems associated therewith, and in the case of doors and partial enclosures, they are often expensive, time consuming and difficult in both terms of use and installation. In the case of shower curtains, these often tend to flap about a user andin particular the feet and ankles of a user while in the shower, due to air or wind within the room concerned and or having regard to the pressure of water passing out of the shower. Such curtains which are often constructed of a plastics or some other sheet material often hang the length of such an open sapce or side of a bath, and often get in the way during a bath being cleaned, or the shower box or enclosure being cleaned. The bottom of such curtains thus often become mouldyand or dirty. It is an object of this invention to overcome at least some of these problems and to provide a straight forward and efficient solution. Other objects of this invention will become apparent from the following description.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to one aspect of this invention there is provided a closure for at least one opening in a shower enclosure as herein defined , including closure material mounted at or adjacent at least one side of said opening location or engagement means being provided on a further side of said opening the mounted closure material being capable of being extended out and across the opening such as to be engageable with said further side of the opening. According to a further aspect of this invention, there is provided a closure for at least one opening in a shower enclosure as herein defined , including closure material mounted about an elongate roller at or adjacent at least one side of said enclosure location or engagement means being provided on a further side of said opening said roller mounted closure material being capable of being rolled out and extended across said opening such as to be engageable with said further side of said opening.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The invention will now be described by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is a general view of one form of the invention. Figure 2 is a plan view of one form of the invention.DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF INVENTION As referred to hereinbefore, the term shower enclosure will be used to describe showers which are at least partially enclosed, having at least one defined, open wall or opening also to describe showers which are mounted over or in baths and therefore have one or more open faces depending upon the location of the bath. For the purposes of description, it is assumed that at least one opening or open face 7 on at least one side of the shower enclosure has spaced apart side faces, defining an opening or spacing therebetween. In the form of the invention shown in the accompanying drawings a shower enclosure 1 is in the form of a shower box mounting a shower pipe 2 and shower rose 3, together with suitable control means 4. An elongate roller 6, being as a spring loaded roller, is mounted by suitable mounting struts brackets, or housing at one side 7a of the opening 7. If desired, the roller 6 can run substantially the height of the opening 7 or can be of any desired length. Preferably, the roller 6 is located substantially vertically, relative to the shower enclosure and opening 7 as shown in the accompanying drawings. This is by way of example only however. The roller 6 can if desired be located horizontally for example at the top or bottom of an opening 7 . The roller 6 is spring loaded or biased, and mounts or has connected thereto, a suitable closure material 10 such as for example vinyl, plastic or the like or any other material or sheet material of which a shower closure or curtain can be made or manufactured. For example, a plastic sheet material with a suitable pattern and or coating on it may be used. Any other suitable material can however be used. The material 10 is preferably wound, mounted and secured around and to the roller 6 and the roller 6 is suitably spring mounted and biased within a housing 12, so that the roller 6 is biased into a position in which the material 10 is rolled about the roller 6 and maintained within the housing 12. The roller 6 therefore acts substantially as a known roller blind. An elongate slot 15 can be provided within the housing 12 through which an end of the material 10 can be passed and the material is pulled out through the slot so as to engage with a further or opposing side 20 of the opening 7 for the purpose of providing an at least partial closure to the opening 7. When the material 10 is not being used to at least partially close an opening however, such as when the shower is not being used , it will be biased by way of the spring biased roller 6 within the housing 12 and about the roller 6 so as to be out of the way. On the further or opposite side 20 of the opening, as shown in the accompanying drawings , suitable and preferably releaseable engagement or locking means 25 may be provided to engage with the closure material 10 so that the closure material 10 can be held in a position at least partially enclosing the opening 7. Preferably, the free or open end 10a of the closure material 10 is provided with an engagement means or lock 18 or a strip of material mounting one or more engagement means or locks which are capable of releaseably engaging with one or more corresponding locking or engagement means 25 on further or opposite sides 20 of the opening 7, to thus permit or facilitate a substantially releaseable engagement therebetween. The engagement means 18 can also be in the form of or can act as a handle or grip for the closure material. Alternatively, or in addition, suitable handle or grip means 26 can be provided attached to or provided in association with closure material 10. For example, suitable hooks, locks or releaseable clips may be provided connected to the closure material 10, corresponding engagement means being provided and mounted at the further or opposite side 20. The engagement means are such as to provide for a straight forward engagement and a straight forward releaseable action, so that the closure material can be engaged and disengaged in a straight forward and efficient manner. If desired, the roller 6 and housing 12 and the engagement means, on both sides of the opening, can be recessed into the side of the shower box or enclosure for aesthetic purposes. In one form of the invention, upper and lower sides 7b, 7c of the opening are formed or provided with runner guides or channels, 35, such as for example substantially U shaped guides or channels 35, in which upper and lower edges of the closure material 10 can run and be retained in position. The invention described above and shown in the accompanying drawings is described with reference to the roller, closure material and the engagement means being provided on side faces of the opening 7, so as to provide a substantially side to side action. If desired, however, the components can be provided on upper and lower faces, so as to provide a top to bottom or bottom to top closing action. If a shower is provided in a bath, or if more than one open side is provided to a shower box, the invention of the present application can, if desired, be provided on more than one side. It will be appreciated that the invention provides for a straight forward arrangement which enables a shower to be partially closed or at least partially closed and for the material or curtain, when finished, to be effectively and securely located and hidden from sight in an efficient and effective and indeed aesthetic manner. The invention also overcomes the problems encountered with shower curtains and enclosures encountered up until this time and referred to hereinbefore. The roller and housing, can be constructed of any desired material, such as stainless steel material, plastics and the like. The clip mechanisms and housing on the opposite side of the opening can likewise be constructed of desired material. The invention has been described by way of example only, with reference to the drawings, wherein the closure material is mounted about a roller. It is however envisaged that the closure material can be provided or housed within a suitable enclosure or housing at at least one side of the opening. For example, an enclosure or housing can be provided having a slot in one face thereof, the material being bunched or formed within the housing and being attached to springs or alternatively being elastically formed or located, so that when the material is pulled or moved outwardly of the housing, it will move against the spring or elastic bias, to be connected to locating or engagement means on the further side 20 of the opening 7. On release, the material will then return with the bias of any springs or elastic, to within the housing. Means are provided to enable the material 10 to be gripped, and to be attached to the engagement or attaching means, these means also preventing the closure material 10 from passing totally into the housing 12. It will be appreciated therefore that the invention is not limited to the closure material 10 being mounted on and about a suitable roller 6. It will be appreciated that modifications and improvements may be made to the invention without departing from the scope thereof, as defined in the appended claims.
