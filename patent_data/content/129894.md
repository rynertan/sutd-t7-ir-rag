# MACHINE CONTROL PANEL

## Abstract
A machine control panel includes a matrix of pressure sensitive switches 10 and a matrix of LED s 12 in a substan tially coplanar array. An aperture array 18 formed by a flex ible cover sheet 16 having an opaque coating 20 surround ing a matrix of transparent apertures 18 is positioned on top of the LED and switch array with corresponding ones of the LED s and apertures in alignment. Unused apertures in the aperture matrix corresponding to unused LED s are selec tively closed by opaque aperture covers 19 . Switch identify ing covers in the form of labels 22 are positioned on top of the aperture array to visually indicate selected ones of the switches 16 . A flexible transparent overlay located on top of the aperture array may be used to protect the labels and aperture covers while enabling a switch operating pressure to be transferred to the switches.
