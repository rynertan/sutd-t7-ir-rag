# TRI STATE CIRCUIT ELEMENT

## Abstract
A Tri State circuit element is constructed which is uniquely suited for use in large scale integrated circuit devices wherein a relatively large number of such Tri State circuits are utilized to drive other circuitry contained within the integrated circuit device. One embodiment of a Tri State circuit is constructed utilizing a single NAND gate 73 , a single inverter 74 , a single P channel transistor 76 , and two N channel transistors 77, 78 yielding a circuit having a propagation delay of only two gate delays and requiring a total of only nine transistors. Another embodiment of this invention is a Tri State circuit constructed utilizing a single NOR gate 84 , a single inverter 83 , a single N channel transistor 88 , and two P channel transistors 86, 87 . In this embodiment of my invention, a total of nine MOS transistors are required and the propagation delay between the input terminal and the output terminal is equal to two gate delays.
