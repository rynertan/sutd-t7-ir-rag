# METHOD OF MAKING SEED SOLUTION USEFUL IN ZEOLITE CATALYST MANUFACTURE

## Abstract
The useful storage life of a clear solution of seeds used to initiate the crystallization of zeolite in porous microspheres of calcined clay is increased by adding sodium silicate solution to a matured seed solution. Seed solution which has become cloudy or gelled can be clarified by adding sodium silicate solution.
