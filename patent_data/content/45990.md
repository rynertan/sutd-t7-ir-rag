## Description
Novel antibacterial and antiprotozoal derivatives, a process for the preparation thereof and related pharmaceutical compositions 0000000000The present invention relates to novel compounds, active against protozoal diseases and bacterial infections, having the following general formula EMI1.1 wherein R is a lower alkyl, containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 3 carbon atoms, and R1 is H or OCH. 3 More particularly, the present invention relates to the p methoxy o tert butyl phenol ester of 5 nitro i midazolyl 2 ethenyl 2 amino pyrimidyl N succ inic acid useful in the treatment of diseases caused by protozoa and bacteria, as for instance trichomoniasis, in its various sites of infection, amoebiasis, giardiasis and anaerobic bacterial infections in their sites of infection.It is well known that trichomoniasis is a social disease that affects both women and men in a high percentage.In women, it occurs as a form of vaginitis in most cases.In men, it occurs asymptomatically and may cause sterility.Remarkable efforts have been made in order to find out a treatment for this disease that holds the first rank among veneral infections and several attempts have been made in order to discover effective and safe chemotherapic agents.The ideal drug should be selectively effective on Trichomonas vaginalis, but not on Ddderlein s bacillus, nor on Meisseria qonorrheae, in order not to upset the vaginal ecology and in order not to mask with an unsuitable treatment the combined gonorrheal infection.Moreover, the ideal chemotherapic drug should not interfere with alcohol metabolism antabuse like effect .The metronidazole, namely 1 2 hydroxyethyl 2 methyl 5 nitro imidazole, Jacobs et al, USP 2,944,061 is still now an available and frequently prescribed drug for the treatment of trichomoniasis, although it is not completely satisfactory, since certain strains of Trichomonas vaginalis became resistant to this drug. ther proposals include the use of certain 1 lower alkyl 2 2 substituted vinyl 5 r,itroimidazoles, as an intermediate to sulfur containing antiprotozoal agents Miller et al, USP 3,549, 626 , and the use of certain 2 5 nitro 2 furyl vinyl pyrimidine derivatives Minami et al, 3,464,982 .USP No. 3,882,105, herein included by reference, disclose and claims the use of 2amino 4 2 1 lower alkyl 5 nitro 2 imidazolyl vinyl pyrimidine for the treatment of protozoal diseases and bacterial infections, particularly as anti trichomonal agent.These compounds, also known under the common name of P compounds , correspond to the following formula EMI2.1 wherein R is a lower alkyl of 1 to 6, preferably 1 to 3 carbon atoms.Other compounds, also known as O compounds , have been further proposed, which are the 3 N oxides of the P compounds, having the formula EMI2.2 wherein R is a lower alkyl, which may be substituted with hydroxy or a lower alkyl sulfonyl group, and R1 is NH2 or NH C H.According to the present invention there is provided a compound of formula I in which R1 is OCH3 and R is CH3, which is a crystalline yellow compound, which decomposes upon heating to 1700 C, is soluble 1 100 in methanol and 1 30 in dimethylformamide, but insoluble in water.For the preparation of the novel compounds above referred to, the process of the present invention provides the steps of a preparing the N succinyl derivative of the 2 amino 4 2 1 lower alkyl 5 nitro 2 imidazolyl vinyl pyrimidine by refluxing this compound with succinic anhydride and then reacting the N succinyl derivative with o tert butyl phenol, possibly substituted in the para position with lower alcoxy, in the presence of concentrated mineral acid.The following example illustrates, without limiting purpose, the process of the invention. EXAMPLE 24.6 g 0.1 moles of azanidazole, i.e. 2 amino 4 2 1 methyl 5 nitro 2 imidazolyl vinyl pyrimidine in 500 mls of dimethylformamide are boiled to reflux for 3 hours with 10.2 g 0.1 moles of succinic anhydride.It is preferable to use an excess of anhydride of 2 3 b.w.The reaction mixture, as a clear solution, is cooled and then poured onto 500 g of ground ice.A yellow, crystalline mass is precipitated, which is the N succinyl derivative of azanidazole.The purification of the reaction product is effected by taking it with a 10 NaH CO3 solution and precipitating again with diluted HCl 1 1 .The yield of the reaction product is 80 of the theoretical value, and it has no definite melting point but decomposes at 1500 C. The analysis of the reaction product by IR and NMR corresponds to N succinyl derivative of azanidazole.1 mole of this derivative in 50 times its weight of dimethylformamide is refluxed with 1 mole of p methoxy o tert butyl phenol, in the presence of 2 mis of concentrated H2504, for 6 hours.The reaction mixture is distilled under reduced pressure 20 mm Hg , thus removing about one half of the solvent, and then the desired compound, i.e. p methoxy o tertbutyl phenol ester of 5 ni tro imidazolyl 2 ethenyl 2 amino pyrimidyl N succinic acid, is crystallized with a yield of 70 of the theoretical value, the product being decomposed at about 1700 C. The compounds of the present invention, particularly the derivative disclosed in the ePxrnple p le have been experimentally tested, from the microbiological, pharmacological end clinical point of view.ActionsThe novel compounds possess direct trichomonacidal and amoebacidal activity againstTrichomonas vaginalis and Entamoeba histolitica, and bactericidal activity against anaerobic microorganisms.The novel compounds are usually well absorbed after oral administration, and well tolerated.Indications Symptomatic and asymptomatic trichomoniasis in females and in males Acute intestinal amoebiasis and amoebic liver abscess Anaerobic bacterial infections at sites such as abdomen, pelvis and chest, and in the treatment of bacteremia, endocarditis, and meningitis. For the prophylaxis in surgical operations in which the risk of postoperative anaerobic infections is high.Microbiology in vitro in vivo The novel compounds are active in vitro against Trichomonas vaqinalis at concentrations lower than those of metronidazole on the sensitive strains, and active on several strains which are resistant to metronidazole. The killirig rate of the novel compounds is higher than that of metronidazole. The novel compound s are active in vitro against Entamoeba histolitica at concentrations of the same range of the metronidazole. The novel compounds are active in vitro against anaerobic microorganisms at concentrations lower than those of metronidazole on the sensitive strains, and active on several strains which are resistant to metronidazole. The novel compounds are not active in vitro against DÃ´derlein s bacillus The novel compounds are not active in vitro against Neisseria qonorrheae. The in vivo efficacy of the novel compounds administered in animals by oral route in experimental infections is higher than that of metronidazole.Pharmacokinetics In animals the novel compounds administered by oral route are rapidly absorbed a single dose of 500 mg kg results in 3 mcg ml blood levels 1 h after the oral administration in rats, the same dose kg in 20 mcg ml blood levels 3 hrs after qral administration in dog. The half life of novel compounds administered in animal dog and in man is shorter than that of metronidazole mole compounds lh, metronidazole 7.3 hrs.
