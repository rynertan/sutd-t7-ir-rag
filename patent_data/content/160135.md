# Tendon for post tensioning prestressed concrete and process for making the tendon.

## Abstract
A tendon for use in posttensioning prestressed concrete comprising a multi wire strand 12 wherein individual peripherally abutting wires 16 define both internal 20 and external 18 interstices between themselves and a central wire 14 , the external interstices 18 being substantially fully filled with a dielectric plastics material such as a high molecular polyolefinic material e.g. high density polyethylene. The plastics material forms an encasement 22 completely surrounding the strand and providing it with a smooth outer surface of circular cross section. A friction reducing, grease like material 28 is coated on the encase ment and the entire structure is thereafter enclosed in a plastics jacket 32 . The above structure is formed by progressively extrusion coating the wire strand with the dielectric plastic, coating the strand with the grease like material and subsequently applying to the thus coated composite with a plastics material to form the jacket.
