# DAMPER FOR A SUPERCONDUCTING ROTOR

## Abstract
A dynamoelectric machine including a damper for a superconducting rotor formed with a laminar assembly of a conductive tube and a plurality of support tubes. The conductive tube is soldered to axialiy adjacent support tubes and the resulting composite tube is explosively welded to support tubes disposed adjacent to its radially inner and outer surfaces.
