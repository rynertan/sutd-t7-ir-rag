## Description
LOW TEMPERATURE, STORAGE STABLE MIXTURES OF POLYESTER PREPOLYMERS AND FLOW MODIFIERS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is well recognized that polyisocyanates which are liquid at room temperature have obvious processing advantages over solid polyisocyanates see for instance U.S.Pat. No. 4,115,429. Polyisocyanates such as the commercially available and widely used toluene diisocyanate TDI and 1,6 hexamethylene diisocyanate are potentially harmful due to their relatively high vapor pressure and accordingly, certain safety precautions are employed to minimize harmful physiological effects. For this reason, various attempts have been made, either to start with diisocyanates that are normally liquid at room temperature and to reduce their physiological effects by certain procedures or to start with diisocyanates that are solid at room temperature and to convert these into liquid form.In both cases, however, one usually obtains either isocyanates of higher valency, i.e., tri or higher polyisocyanates or higher molecular weight diisocyanates or a combination of these effects. Important diisocyanates which are solid at room temperature and which are readily available on a large commercial scale are 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate and the 2,4 isomer thereof which melt at 390C and 34.50C, respectively. Attempts have already been made to liquefy both the 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate and a mixture of the 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate and a small amount of the 2,4 isomer. Thus, for example in U.S.Pat. No. 3,644,457, 1 mol of a diphenylmethane diisocyanate is reacted with from about 0.1 to about 0.3 mol of poly 1,2 propylene ether glycol. While the products made according to this patent have met with commercial success, they still suffer from a serious drawback. Specifically, it has been found that these adducts generally will crystallize anywhere from 59C to as high as 250C. In fact, when supplied in commercial quantities, these adducts are generally transported in heated trucks. Additionally, in order to thaw the materials it is generally necessary to heat them to somewhere in excess of 500C to 600C. While in warmer climates there may not be any problem, in colder areas where the product may be stored in tanks over a period of time, this tendency to crystallize can become a very serious problem.Similar attempts to form liquid diphenylmethane diisocyanates have been described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,384,653 and 3,394,164. The attempts to liquefy in both of these instances were based on the addition of, in one case, a trihydrocarbyl phosphate, and, in the other case, small amounts of phosphoric acid. In any event, the storage stability of both of these types of products is again quite good around room temperature, but as the temperature decreases, both types of materials tend to crystallize. Isocyanato terminated prepolymers of about 600 to about 4500 molecular weight, e.g., prepared from the reaction of an excess of 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate MDI with i linear or slightly branched polyesterdiols with without polyestertriols reaction products of lower aliphatic glycols with without small amounts of glycerol and alkanedicarboxylic acids , or ii dipropylene glycol, comprise products generally having melting points of about 100C to about 300C, and higher, depending primarily on the amount and structure of the polyol employed. Quasiprepolymers containing, by weight, from about 50 to about 60 of the polyol segment e.g., a polyol from adipic acid, ethylene glycol, 1,4 butanediol are generally liquid products at room temperature.When the MDI content is increased to about 60 , or more, the resulting quasiprepolymers are oftentimes crystalline products in the 150C 200C range. Quasi prepolymers comprised of MDI and about 10 158 of the di and or tripropylene glycol s are oftentimes crystalline at about 150C 200C. In this state, the quasi prepolymers are more difficult to process, exhibit greater tendency towards dimerization and trimerization reactions, and detract from optimal physical characteristics of the end polyurethane product. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been found quite unexpectedly indeed that there can be prepared novel low temperature, storage stable, liquid mixtures of 1 isocyanato containing prepolymers derived from the reaction of i a polyol and ii an organic polyisocyanate characterized by a methylene group bonded to two benzene nuclei as, for example, 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate, and 2 a nonhydroxylcontaining flow modifier, hereinafter developed in detail. The non hydroxyl flow modifier is a normallyliquid compound and compatible with the prepolymer, or it may be a low melting solid which forms a normally liquid, compatible mixture with the prepolymer.The addition of a few parts by weight , e.g., about 3 parts of flow modifi er per 100 parts by weight of prepolymer can result in compatible mixtures whose melting points are measurably lower than the prepolymer per se. In general, a practical commercial lower limit is approximately 5 parts flow modifier per 100 parts prepolymer. Thus, in the practice of the invention, there can be prepared novel liquid compatible mixtures comprising prepolymer s and flow modifier s which exhibit storage stability for long periods of time at temperatures substantially below room temperature, for example, at about 50C to 100C, and lower, for several days to several weeks, e.g., at least 100 hours,.and longer. Many of the novel liquid mixtures exhibited compatibility, did not crystallize or phase separate, and remained chemically stable for at least one week and upwards to several weeks at temperatures at about OOC, and lower, e.g., 5 C. Thus, the novel mixtures can be transported over great distances and stored for prolonged periods of time at low temperature, and remain in a compatible liquid state ready for the intended use. Handling and processing problems which are associated with polyisocyanate compounds crystallizing or melting in the 150C to 300C and higher range are substantially eliminated by using the novel mixtures described herein. Moreover, it has been observed that dimerization and trimerization reactions are greatly reduced.The novel storage stable liquid mixtures are readily cast or metered through pumps, and have very low vapor pressure and therefore are substantially physiologically harmless. The novel liquid mixtures comprising prepolymer and non hydroxyl flow modifier can be employed in the NCO OH polyaddition reactions to prepare a wide variety of polyurethane products, especially microcellular products such as, for example, integral skin microcellular polyurethanes. Such products exhibit a broad spectrum of highly desirable and or improved characteristics. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that a wide variety of nonhydroxyl containing flow modifiers can be admixed with the prepolymers to form novel low temperature, storage stable, liquid mixtures. The flow modifier and prepolymer are compatible and soluble with each other forming a solution which does not phase separate for long periods of time at low temperatures. The flow modifier has a boiling point above about 1500C and is normally liquid, i.e., liquid at about 200C, or is a relatively low melting solid which forms with the prepolymer a compatible, storage stable, low temperature liquid mixture. The flow modifier consists essentially of a carbon and hydrogen atoms, preferably in the form of a monovalent and or polyvalent hydrocarbon group such as a C1 Clgacyclic group, a Cs C7 cyclo aliphatic group including unsubstituted and the mono and poly C1 C4 alkyl substituted Cs C7cycloalkyl, and or a benzenoid ring nucleus, e.g., mono , fused , and bridged nuclei, including the partially or fully hydro genated ring substituted counterparts thereof and b oxygen in the form of 1 to 3 esterEMI5.1 groups, preferably 2 ester groups.Illustrative flow modifiers include the monoester and polyesters of mono and polyhydric and phenolic compounds hydroxyl compound s for convenience with mono and polycarboxylic acids, for example, the diester of a monohydroxyl compound and a dicarboxylic acid, the triester of a monohydroxyl compound and a tricarboxylic acid, the diester of a dihydroxyl compound and a monocarboxylic acid, the triester of a trihydroxyl compound and a monocarboxylic acid, the monoester of a monohydroxyl compound and a monocarboxylic acid, and obvious mixtures thereof. The average molecular weight of the flow modifiers which are employed in the preparation of the novel storage stable, liquid mixtures can vary over a wide range depending on the prepolymer component and the flow modifier of choice. Thus, the molecular weight can range from about 100 to approximately 1000. The flow modifier, as noted previously, is a normally liquid material or a relatively low melting solid, and forms a compatible liquid with the prepolymer component which is stable at low temperature over prolonged periods of time. In general, however, many flow modifiers suitable in the practice of the invention have molecular weights in the range of from about 135 to about 850, desirably from about 150 to about 600.The flow modifiers are characterized by the absence of groups which are normally reactive with an isocyanato group NCO at typical storage and shipping temperatures such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, thiol, primary amino, secondary amino, and the like. Various subclasses of flow modifiers which are suitable in the practice of the invention s are represented by the structural formulas infra. A preferred subclass is shown below as formula I EMI6.1 wherein each R , individually, represents a monovalentC1 C18acyclic or a Cs C7alicyclic or an aryl hydrocarbon group such as C2 C12alkenyl, C1 C18alkyl, a Cs C7cyclo alkyl or Cs C7cycloalkenyl which may contain Cl C4alkyl substituents thereon, for example, methyl, ethyl, butyl, hexyl, octyl, isooctyl, lauryl, stearyl, allyl, hexenyl, oleyl, cyclohexyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexenyl, cyclohexylmethyl, methylcyclohexyl, phenyl, biphenyl, and xylyl wherein x is an integer having a value of 1 to 3, preferably 2 and wherein R represents a mono or polyvalent hydrocarbon group, its valence depending on the value of x. Illustrative R groups include acyclic, alicyclic and aromatic hydrocarbon groups having up to 17 carbon atoms such as C4 C17alkyl C4 C17alkenyl C2 C12alkylene C2 C12alkenylene unsubstituted and Cl C4alkyl substituted C C7cycloalkyl, Cs C7cycloalkenyl, C5 C7cycloalkylene, or C5 C7cycloalkenylene mono , di , and trivalent benzene including mono, fused, and bridged and the partially and fully hydrogenated counterparts thereof for example, butyl, hexyl, octyl, dodecyl, oleyl, stearyl, lauryl, ethylene, propylene, trimethylene, tetramethylene, 1,5 pentylene, 1,6 hexylene, 1,7 heptylene, 1,8 octylene, 1 ,10 decylene, octanetriyl, cyclohexyl, cyclohexylene, phenethyl, benzyl, phenyl, Cl C4alkylphenyl, Cl C4alkylphenylene, phenylene, benzenetriyl, naphthylene, and the like. The di Cl Cl2alkyl C4 C10alkanedioates and the di C1 C12alkyl phthalates are preferred. Another subclass of flow modifiers useful in the practice of the invention is represented by Formula II infra EMI7.1 whrein y is an integer having a valence of 1 2 wherein each R , individually, has the meanings assigned to R inFormula I supra wherein R is a divalent or trivalent hydrocarbon group, its valence depending on the value of y, and has the meanings assigned to polyvalent R of 0Formula I supra and wherein each R CO group of FormulaII is monovalently bonded to separate carbon atoms of theR variable. Flow modifiers suitable in the practice of the invention include the diesters and triesters of C2 C17alkanoic acid or benzoic acid with C2 Cgalkanediols orC3 C6alkanetriols. Specific flow modifiers can be illustrated by dibutyl phthalate, dibutyl terephthalate, diisooctyl phthalate, di n octyl terephthalate, diisobutyl adipate, di 2 ethylhexyl adipate, di 2 ethylhexyl glutarate, dibutyl sebacate, dihexyl sebacate, dimethyl phthalate, butyl octanoate, the triester of glycerol and butyric acid, the diester of 1,4 butanediol and hexanoic acid, and the like. The prepolymer component of the novel low temperature, storage stable, liquid mixtures comprises the reaction product s of a diphenylmethane diisocyanate with linear and or slightly branched chain polyesterpolyols or polyetherpolyols. Suitable polyesterpolyols are those having hydroxyl equivalent weights in the range of from about 400 to about 2250, although polyesterpolyol outside this range can be used to produce useful urethane products. Useful polyetherpolyols fall in a somewhat broader hydroxyl equivalent range, e.g., from about 60 to about 2250.However, novel liquid mixtures comprising quasi prepolymers from a diphenylmethane diisocyanate and a a polyesterdiol, and optionally, a small amount of higher polyesterpolyol s having hydroxyl equivalent weights between about 500 to about 2000, or b a polyetherpolyol, and optionally, a small amount of higher polyetherpolyols having hydroxyl equivalent weights between about 200 to about 2000, are most desirable in the manufacture of high performance microcellular urethane elastomers including integral skin microcellular urethane products.For instance, integral skin microcellular urethane articles, e.g., shoe soles, can be obtained which are characterized by a resilient core of substantially uniform density and an integrally formed, tough, substantially continuous surface skin surrounding said core, the boundary between said skin and said core being characterized by a rather abrupt change in density. The skin is itself flexible, essentially devoid of blemishes, impervious to oil and water, directly accepts paint without first requiring primers to its surface, and exhibits good flex life, high tear strength, and generally superior abrasion resistance especially with respect to various polyester polyurethane products . In the practice of preferred embodiments of the invention, there can be achieved liquid, compatible, low temperature, long standing, storage stable solutions comprising prepolymer and flow modifier and outstanding urethane products therefrom, e.g., molded microcellular integral skin shoe soles, by utilizing prepolymers derived from a diphenylmethane diisocyanate and linear polyesterdiols or polyetherdiols and or slightly branched higher polyesterpolyols or polyetherpolyols which have hydroxyl equivalent weight in the range of from about 500 to about 1500, preferably from about 750 to about 1250, and most preferably approximating 1000. In general, the function ality OH of the polyesterpolyol or the polyetherpolyol is in the range of from 2 to about 3, desirably 2 to about 2.5, preferably 2 to about 2.2, and most preferably 2 to about 2.1. The linear and or branched polyesterpolyols may be prepared by processes which are well known in the prior art. For example, the polyesterpolyols may be manufactured by polyesterification of polycarboxylic acids, hydroxycarboxylic acids including lower oligomers thereof, or lactones with glycols or higher polyols, including mixtures of the foregoing, generally in the presence of a suitable catalyst and at an elevated temperature. The polyesterpolyols derived from epsilon caprolactones and other monomers are adequately described in U.S. Pat. No.3,169,945 and generally comprises the reaction of one or more lactones with one or more polyols. Additional polyesterpolyols are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,666,724 and 3,957,753. Other polyesterpolyols, as indicated previously, are derived from the esterification reaction of at least one polycarboxylic acid with at least one polyol. Illustrative polycarboxylic acids include succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, and the like. Anhydrides of the acids can also be used. Illustrative polyhydric compounds include the aliphatic glycols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,3 propanediol, 1,4 butanediol, 1,5 pentanediol, 1,6hexanediol, l,10 hexanediol, neopentylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, and others. Examples of other polyhydric compound include the trihydric alcohols such as glycerol, l,l,l trimethylolethane, l,l,l trimethylol propane, and 1,2,6 hexanetriol pentaerythritol sorbitol and the like.The C4 Ci0alkanedioic acids are preferred, in particular, glutaric acid and adipic acid, whereas the saturated C2 C6aliphatic diols are most suitable. The linear and branched chain polyetherpolyols can be prepared by processes well documented in the art as by reacting a hydroxylated functional compound such as C2 Cloalkanediols, C3 Cl0alkanetriols, tetrols, etc., e.g., ethylene glycol, 1,4 butanediol, 1,2 propanediol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, trimethylolethane, H2O, and others, with an epoxide compound, preferably a vicinal epoxide characterized by theEMI10.1 group, e.g., ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, 1,2 butylene oxide, 2,3butylene oxide, styrene oxide, epichlorohydrin, 1,2 epoxycyclohexane, tetrahydrofuran, mixtures thereof, and the like. Preferred epoxides are propylene oxide, ethylene oxide, mixtures thereof with without minor amounts of other epoxide compounds.Particularly preferred polyetherpolyols are characterized by oxypropylene units, oxypropyleneoxyethylene units, with without partial capping of the polyetherpolyol with ethylene oxide to enhance the primary hydroxyl termination of the polyetherpolyol. The polyisocyanate compound used in the preparation of the isocyanato terminated prepolymer is characterized by a methylene group CH2 , each valence of which is separately bonded to a carbon atom of a benzenoid nucleus such as a diphenylmethane diisocyanate MDI , for example, 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 2,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate, mixtures of 4,4 MDI and 2,4 MDI, a mixture of 4,4 MDI and the carbodiimide thereof such as Isonate 143 L, mixtures of 4,4 MDI and minor amount of the 2,4 and 2,2 MDI isomers, and the like. The isocyanate compound and polyol are reacted in a ratio of NCO groups to OH groups of at least about 2.5 1, but a more suitable range of NCO equivalents per OH equivalent is from about 2,7 to about 24 NCO to one OH .A NCO OH ratio in the range of from about 3.7 1 to about 12 1 is preferred with a most preferred ratio being from about 7 to about 12 NCO equivalents per one OH equivalent. The addition of the flow modifiers of the invention to the prepolymers not only improves the low temperature stabiity of these prepolymers but very unexpectedly and surprisingly, indeed, also improves their chemical stability. It has been observed that the tendency towards the formation of insoluble isocyanate trimers and dimers under ambient storage conditions of from about 10 C 30 C is markedly reduced. Various mixtures of flow modifier and prepolymer have been observed to be clear after several months indicating a total absence of dimer and trimer formation. A few parts, e.g., 2 3 parts1 of flow modifier added to 100 parts of prepolymer can result in a compatible solution whose melting point is measurably lower than the prepolymer per se. In general, it is desirable to incorporate at least about 5 parts by weight of flow modifier into 100 parts by weight of prepolymer. Though in some instances 35 parts, and even more, of flow modifier per 100 parts of prepolymer can be admixed together to form low temperature, storage stable, compatible solutions, it is desirable to employ about 5 to about 30 parts, preferably from about 7 to about 25 parts, and preferably still from about 7 to about 20 parts, of flow modifier per 100 parts of prepolymer. The optimum commercial range will, to a large degree, depend on the choice of the flow modifier and prepolymer.One or more flow modifiers can be employed in the practice of the invention providing the resulting novel mixture is a normally liquid, compatible mixture. Additional ingredients which do not contain hydrogen active with isocyanato groups, e.g., surfactant, blowing agent, dye, can be incorporated into the novel mixture. Inasmuch as a number of components employed in the practice of the invention have been identified by their trade names, for the sake of convenience, these are tabulated herein and their chemical structure or specifications further amplified so that any of these components can be readily obtainable or made by those of ordinary skill in the art.
