# Keyboard operated RF network analyzer.

## Abstract
The network analyzer is structured to provide high ease of use and nearly complete automation for laboratory and automated production measurements. Features include a hierarchal command structure enabling the automatic asso ciation of specific instrument settings to measurements of specific parameters and automatic reestablishment of proper instrument settings upon changes in parameter selection fully coordinated communications between subsystem modules real time, two channel, precision vec tor measurements with internal error correction frequency capability from RF to millimeter bands combined time and frequency domain analysis and display measurements either in the swept or step frequency modes and user definable test functions and calibration device sets.
