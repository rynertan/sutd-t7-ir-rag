# Servomotor control systems.

## Abstract
In a servo control system for a reluctance motor 23 , the output of a reference waveform generator 27 is applied to a power converter 29 through a current controller 28 . Under standstill conditions, at least two of the motor windings are energised so that both forward and reverse torques are established, the forward torque being in equilibrium with the reverse torque. The controller 28 may be responsive to a bias signal to establish said torques. The control system may form part of a reluctance motor drive system.
