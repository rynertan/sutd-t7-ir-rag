# Improvements in and relating to socket less pipe joints.

## Abstract
To provide an electrically conductive path between metal pipes 1, 2, e.g. soil or drain pipes, connected at butting ends by means of an annular gasket 3 of electrically insulating material which fits around and spans the butting ends and is secured in sealing engagement with the butting ends by clamp 5, a bridge element 4 of electrically conduc tive material retained to the gasket extends between and engages with the pipes. The bridge element 4 is conveniently an attachment to the gasket having portions disposed at internal and external circumferential surfaces of the gasket. Teeth 14, or like formations, on the bridge element dig into the surfaces of the pipes to enhance the engagement. Electrically conductive engagement may also be made with the clamp 5 at a portion 12 of the bridge element at the exterior of the gasket.
