This test procedure is described in the following paragraphs. This screen consists of determining the effects of increasing intravenous doses of compound on myocardial contractility dP dt max of left ventricular blood pressure , heart rate, aortic blood pressure, and vascular resistance of the pentobarbital anesthetized dog. Adult mongrel dogs of either sex are anesthetized with pentobarbital, 35 mg kg, IV, and are subsequently maintained under anesthesia with a continuous infusion of pentobarbital, 3.5 mg kg hour. The trachea is intubated but the animals are permitted to breathe spontaneously. A cannula is inserted into the femoral vein for administrating test agents. A Millar catheter tip pressure transducer or a fluid filled catheter is inserted into the ascending aorta via the femoral artery for measuring aortic blood pressure. A Millar catheter tip pressure transducer is passed into the left ventricle via the left carotid artery for measuring left ventricle blood pressure. Needle electrodes are placed subcutaneously for recording a lead II electrocardiogram ECG . Left ventricular and aortic blood pressures are recorded on a strip chart recorder. Heart rate, using a biotachometer triggered from the R wave of the ECG, and the first derivative of left ventricular blood pressure dP dt , obtained with a differentiator amplifier coupled to the corresponding pressure amplifier, are also recorded. Changes in vascular resistance is also recorded showing increased resistance as a peripheral effect.

The usefulness of the compounds of the present invention as antithrombotic agents is demonstrated by their effectiveness in inhibiting human platelet aggregation in standard in vitro platelet aggregation tests using human platelet rich plasma. Blood is collected from volunteers who have not injested aspirin or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs within the preceding two weeks and have not eaten within nine hours before blood draw. Blood is collected in 4.5 ml portions in Vacutainer Number 6462S silicone coated tubes containing 0.5 ml of 3.8 trisodium citrate. Usually six portions of 4.5 ml are drawn from each volunteer. The blood collected from three or four volunteers is pooled prior to centrifugation. The pooled blood is put in 50 ml polyethylene tubes and centrifuged at 80 xg ca 600 rpm in an International Model K centrifuge with number 240 rotor for 20 minutes at room temperature. A portion approximately two thirds of the supernatant platelet rich plasma PRP is removed and set aside, and the remaining blood sample is recentrifuged at 1400 xg ca 2800 rpm for 15 minutes to prepare platelet poor plasma PPP . The platelet content of the PRP is determined with a Coulter Thrombocounter. The PRP is adjusted to a count of 250,000 platelets per microliter using the PPP. Test drugs are dissolved in small amounts of dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO followed by dilution with saline final concentration of DMSO is 1 . Other lower concentrations are prepared by serial dilution in saline. Platelet rich plasma adjusted to 250,000 platelets per microliter is distributed in 0.36 ml aliquots into silicone coated cuvettes of 0.312 inch diameter. Addition of drug solution or saline 0.02 ml is followed by addition of aggregating agents ADP or collagen suspension, 0.02 ml . Extent of aggregation ADP stimulus or rate of aggregation collagen stimulus is determined using the Payton Scientific Dual Channel Aggregation Module, Model 300B. Appropriate concentrations of aggregating agents are determined by an initial brief titration. The height in millimeters of aggregation curves for control no drug addition, saline only aggregations are compared with the heights of curves obtained after drug addition at various appropriate concentrations. Heights after drug addition are finally expressed as percent of control values. These values are plotted versus drug concentration on semilog paper. Estimates of IC₅₀ values can then be made from the resulting curves. The major slopes i.e., the slope of the longest straight line portion of collagen induced aggregation curves are determined and compared to the slopes obtained for control aggregation curves saline and aggregating agent only added . Values obtained are expressed as percent of control values. These values are plotted versus drug concentration on semilog paper. Estimates of IC₅₀ values are made from the resulting curves. When tested by the above procedure, 6 4,5 dihydro 4,4 dimethyl 5 oxo 1 Accordingly, the present invention also includes a method for treating thrombosis in mammals suffering therefrom comprising administering to such mammals either orally or parenterally a corresponding pharmaceutical composition containing a compound of the formula I as defined above in Appropriate Unit Dosage Form. For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds described by this invention, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets, and suppositories. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solublizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders or tablet disintegrating agents it can also be encapsulating material. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in admixture with the finely divided active compound. In the tablet the active compound is mixed with carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain from 5 or 10 to about 70 percent of the active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term preparation is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as carrier providing a capsule in which the active component with or without other carriers is surrounded by carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets are included. Tablets, powders, cachets, and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter is first melted, and the active ingredient is dispersed homogeneously therein as by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool and thereby to solidify. Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection. Liquid preparations can also be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizing and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, i.e., natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and other well known suspending agents. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These particular solid form preparations are most conveniently provided in unit dose form and as such are used to provide a single liquid dosage unit. Alternatively, sufficient solid may be provided so that after conversion to liquid form, multiple individual liquid doses may be obtained by measuring predetermined volumes of the liquid form preparation as with a syringe, teaspoon, or other volumetric container. When multiple liquid doses are so prepared, it is preferred to maintain the unused portion of said liquid doses at low temperature i.e., under refrigeration in order to retard possible decomposition. The solid form preparations intended to be converted to liquid form may contain, in addition to the active material, flavorants, colorants, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like. The liquid utilized for preparing the liquid form preparation may be water, isotonic water, ethanol, glycerine, propylene glycol, and the like as well as mixtures thereof. Naturally, the liquid utilized will be chosen with regard to the route of administration, for example, liquid preparations containing large amounts of ethanol are not suitable for parenteral use. Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, for example, packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. The unit dosage form can also be a capsule, cachet, or tablet itself or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. The quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from 10 mg to 500 mg preferably to 5 to 100 mg according to the particular application and the potency of the active ingredient. The compositions can, if desired, also contain other compatible therapeutic agents. In therapeutic use as described above, the mammalian dosage range for a 70 kg subject is ordinarily from 0.01 to 10 mg kg of body weight per day or preferably 0.1 to 5 mg kg of body weight per day. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the compound being employed. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired.
