# Method and apparatus for fuel combustion with low NOx, soot and particulates emission.

## Abstract
The emission of NOx, soot and particulates is kept low by combusting fuel in two sequential steps, viz. a first com bustion step wherein a number of fuel jets and a substoi chiometric amount of combustion air in the form of an equal number of high velocity air jets are injected into a combus tion chamber in such a manner that a each fuel jet merge into one high velocity air jet, b the characteristic mixing time of each fuel jet is less than about 10 ‚Å¥sec, and c a plurality of separate fuel air jets are generated forming at ignition a plurality of primary flames in which a residence time for the fuel of substantially at least 100 ms is maintained and a second combustion step comprising introducing further combustion air into said combustion chamber for complete combustion of the fuel.
