# GENETICALLY MODIFIED MICRO ORGANISMS

## Abstract
A recombinant DNA molecule which a comprises i a gene which codes for proricin or a portion thereof and ii a suitable vector which carries the said gene adjacent to and under the control of appropriate expression signals and b is capable, when inserted into a suitable host organism, of producing a metabolite which is or is closely related to proricin or a portion thereof.
