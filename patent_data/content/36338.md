# A regenerative, fluid filter.

## Abstract
The novel filter, according to an embodiment thereof, comprises a filter matrix formed into a specific geometry and made of glass, metal, mineral and or cellulosic fibers, fibers or fiber agglomerates moulded from thermoplastic, ther moset plastics, elastoplasts, or related synthetic polymer materials, or natural fibers, such as cotton, wool, and the like, which have been coated, impregnated, or compounded, prior to forming, with a series of substances in order that the filter may be easily cleaned and reused, as well as protected against corrosive action by the fluid media, or to render sub stances in the filtration fluid media chemically unreactive, or to change the chemical state or structure of matter in the fluid media. The coating compounds, filler compounds, or impreg nants, depending upon which thereof are employed, change the physical properties of the filter matrix and alters impaction retention of the filtered particles, and or alters the electro static attraction of the matrix for matter in the fluid media, and or imparts corrosion protection to the filter mat rix, and or renders matter in the fluid media chemically unreactive by changing its reactivity characteristics or chemi cal structure upon contact with the matrix.
