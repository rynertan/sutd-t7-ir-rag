# DIGITAL SIGNAL TRANSMISSION DEVICE.

## Abstract
A digital signal transmission device in which input digital signals consisting of a train of words that are continuous in time are formed into a block every after a predetermined number of words, and the block is transmitted through the so called encode filter or a differential processing filter to obtain an estimated error for a signal for each block. The encode filter consists of a plurality of filters made up of an estimating unit of an N th degree and an estimating unit of a degree smaller than the N th degree. Maximum absolute values in the blocks produced from the filters or maximum absolute values multiplied by a coefficient are compared with one another, and by selecting a filter which minimizes the value, the input digital signals can be transmitted through filters that provide the greatest efficiency for each of the blocks, i.e., that produce the least estimated errors.
