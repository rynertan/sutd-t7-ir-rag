# Resistive gate field effect transistor logic family.

## Abstract
A family of digital logic circuits constructed with resis tive gate field effect transistors is provided. The logic circuits are comprised of AND and OR circuits, each implemented with resistive gate devices. In constructing an AND circuit the resistive gate 6 lies along the length of the channel region between the source 2 and drain 4 of the device. Logic input signals at 10, 12, 13 are selectively applied along the length of the channel region to the resistive gate. The device will conduct between source and drain only if all points along the channel are above the local threshold voltage of the channel region which will occur when appropriate logic signals are applied simultaneously to all logic input terminals. A logic OR device is realized when the resistive gate 45 is formed transverse to the channel such that each input to the gate controls a portion of the channel between the source 44 and drain 42 . NAND and NOR circuits are provided using the resistive gate logic device in an inverting circuit context.
