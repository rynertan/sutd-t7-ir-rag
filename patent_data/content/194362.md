# Process for preparing an acyl lactam compound.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for preparing an acyyl lactam compound characterized in that the reaction product of a lactam with a dicarboxylic acid anhydride is reacted with a polyol at a temperature of 150 C at most. These acyl lactam compounds are very suitable as activator in the preparation of nylon block copolymers, more specifically in the RIM or RRIM systems.
