# Vehicle lamp assembly.

## Abstract
A vehicle lamp assembly, of the type in which the colour of the light to be produced by the lamp cannot readily be perceived when the lamp is not illuminated, comprises an outer light transmitting member 40 having horizontal strips 42 of opaque material embedded in its outer surface. A respective horizontal baffle 50 is aligned with each opaque strip 42 . A lens element 44,46,48 focuses collimated light on the gaps between the strips 42 and can also serve as a colour filter.
