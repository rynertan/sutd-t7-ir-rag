# Kneading machine.

## Abstract
A kneading machine comprises a cylindrical container with a supply opening and a discharge opening, a rotational shaft disposed on the axis of the container, and a plurality of blades on the shaft. Each blade comprises a pair of side plates and a kneading blade. The kneading blade is formed with a roll in angle, and in the case of a batch type kneading machine, both side plates are disposed at a feed angle to effect axially reciprocating movement of material for more efficient kneading. In the case of a continuous process kneading machine, the supply and discharge are axially displaced, and some of the blades comprise side plates perpendicular to the rotation axis, while other blaaes have an angled side plate for effecting gradual axial feed of material from supply to discharge. The blades are replaceable on the shaft. The rate of feed, and therefore the speed at which kneading takes place, can be adjusted by selecting appropri ate numbers and positions for the blades with angled side plates.
