# FORMS FEEDING APPARATUS

## Abstract
An overhead unit used with a printer having a platen for feeding continuous, fan folded, edge perforated forms. The tractors which engage the feed perforations on the forms are driven with the platen. The unit automatically bursts the side perforations along the margins of the forms where the feed perforations are located by the use of flexural mem bers which extract energy from the forms feed and oscil lates to shear the side perforations. Bursting of the cross perforations which separate successive forms is carried out by a pivotally mounted, lever actuated bar which engages the platen and forms a toggle therewith to engage the suc cessive forms against the platen just below the cross perfo rations the toggle being arranged to tighten and increase the clamping force, as the form is pulled away from the plat en when bursting the cross perforations. Precision feeding of the forms so as to enable printing of high quality precise images on the forms is facilitated by a roller assembly in cluding rollers engaging the outside of the loop on the in feed or upstream side of the platen to remove any platen wave due to differential displacement of the forms as they travel with linear motion through the tractors and with rota tional motion around the platen. These rollers also steer the form to counteract lateral meandering thereof on the platen. Other rollers on the infeed side of the tractors wrap the forms to at least a 90 arc to eliminate positive tents at the cross perforations. Backlash is removed by a diagonally split collet and tapered sleeve which controls the clearance between the tractor drive shaft and the sprockets of the trac tors. Additional rollers on the drive shaft and the support shaft for the tractors, which can be used together with fin gers extending from the support shaft, stiffen the forms be tween the tractors to facilitate bidirectional feeding thereof and bursting by the shearing flexures.
