# Apparatus for digital position measurements.

## Abstract
For each axis, a cyclic transducer has a scale supplied with a sinusoidal signal from a timing unit and a cursor which provides two output signals which are proportional to the sine and to the cosine, within the elementary interval of the transducer. Sineα and cosα and the corresponding inverted signals are supplied to squaring circuits and logic which generates a three bit number in a register defining the octant 000 to 111, i.e. 0 to 7 within which α lies. The three bit number controls multiplexers 32 and 33 each having inputs for quadrants 0 to 7 and feeding respective sample and hold circuits 34 and 36 whose signals are NUM and DEN. The multiplexer inputs are so selected from sinα, cosα, sinα and cosα that is tanα in octants 0, 2, 4, 6 and is cotα in octants 1, 3, 5, 7 . is thus always positive and in the range 0 to 1 . An analog to digital converter system 40 forms the digital value n and n along with the lowest order octant bit address a ROM 41 which outputs the value of α within the range of a quadrant. A microprocessor 42 responds to the higher two bits to add K τ 2 where K 0, 1, 2 or 3 so as to create the final value of α. The microprocessor also keeps count of the integral displacements of elementary intervals. The apparatus enables α to be determined in stantaneously, thereby eliminating the following error of known apparatuses when α is changing.
