# Valley gutter covering and roof with such valley gutter.

## Abstract
A valley gutter covering for a tiled roof comprising a plastically deformable plastic strip fastened to the roof structure and arranged so that tiles of the roof overlie edge portions of the strip. The strip is a flexible band having a smooth underside, bulbous edge portions 15 of its upper side which engage the tiles to form a seal, and a number of spaced longitudinally extending ribs 12, 13, 14 in its central zone. The ribs include a relatively thick central rib 13 and a number of thinner ribs 12 on either side of the centre. The ribs provide a relatively rigid central zone of the strip while the unribbed zones between this central zone and the bulbous edge portions have sufficient flexibility to take up deformations caused by expansion and contraction of the roof structure.

## Description
VALLEY GUTTER COVER1N5 The invention relates to a valley channel or gutter covering for roofs covered with roofing slabs or tiles, comprising valley strips made of plastics fastened to the roof structure and whose longitudinal edges have a barrier which prevents the ingress of water, dust and or driven snow, on which barrier rest the roofing tiles adjoining the valley and overlapping the lateral zones of the valley strips. Valley strips made of plastics are known, for example, from the German Offenlequnqsschrift 2 315 610.The known valley strip is designed as a flat strip which has a corrugation extending longitudinally along the centre line, which corrugation separates two flat areas from one another. The barrier along each longitudinal edge is formed by a doubled over layer of the strip, so that a hollow fold is formed for receiving clips or nails. Furthermore, a series of variously shaped metal valleys are known for roof covering cf. Deutches Dachdecker Handwerk, 1964, paqes 205 206 .Here there is described, for example, n valley sheet or fiashing having a web extending along the centre line in longitudinal direction, which web serves as a snlash guard and prevents rain water streaming down off of one roof surface from runninq under the covering of the other roof surface. Finally, in the case of plastics gutters it is known to provide longitudinally extending ribs over their entire inside, which ribs assist in improving the flow conditions, counteract any clogging of the gutter caused by the accumulation of leaves or the like and assist in stiffeninq and strengthening the gutter. The object on which the invention is based lies in providing for a valley channel or qutter covering of the aforementioned type a valley strio which can be easily installed, which can be adapted to valley gutters of various shapes, which after installation forms a stable and durable valley gutter, and which enables the mechanical stresses caused by temperature variations and or expansion and contraction of the roof structure to be taken up without visible distortion. The achievement of this object according to the invention is reflected in the characterising features of Patent Claim 1. Further features and preferred embodiments of the valley gutter covering of the invention appear in the sub claims. This invention provides a valley strip made of plastically deformable plastics. To effect installation it is merely necessary to fit the valley strip, which thus undergoes plastic deformation, to the valley boarding and to fasten it in the edge zones by means of nails or the like. In this way there is provided a valley strip which can be readily installed and which can be adanted to almost all vall gutters Isxistiriq in practice. Even the ribbed central area of the valley strip can be deformed plastically to a small extent but, because of the ribs, is so strong that 2. stable and durable lining is obtained.In the ribless lateral zones between the edge zones and the central area, the valley strip merely has sufficient strength for these lateral zones to be capable of taking up, with nossibly visible distortion, the mechanical stresses caused by temperature variations and or the expansion and contraction of the roof structure. Since the chiselled ends of the roofing tiles overlap these lateral zones, such distortions are not visible on the finished roof.Accordingly, only the ribbed central area of thevalley striD is visible from the exterior, which in view of its strenqth is not subject to any distortion.Consequently, an easily installed and stable valley gutter covering is obtained, which can he fitted to match a variety of valley gutter shapes and which always offers a neat and aesthetically attractive appearance. The invention will be illustrated in detail below with reference to a preferred embodiment of a valley strip Seven sheets of drawings also serve for its explanation and individually in Figures 1 to 8. Figure 1 shows a valley strip in crosssection Figure 2 shows a diagrammatic and isometric illustration of the valley strip according toFigure 1 Figures 3 and 4 show a diagrammatic sectional view of a valley strip installed in a finished roof covering Figure 5 shows an isometric illustration of the covering of a valley gutter with individual pieces of valley strip Figure 6 shows diagrammatically the formation of possible distortions in an installed valley strip Figures 7 and 8 show a diagrammatic top view of a finished roof with the valley gutter covering according to the invention. As illustrated in Fiqures 1 and 2, the valley strip 10 consists of a flexible band 11 with a smooth underside and having ribs 12, 13, 14 and bulbous thickened portions 15 on the upper side. The ribs and thickened portions are formed integrally with the band. As material for the valley strip 10 there may be used rot resistant, weatherproof plastics materials which are plastically deformable. Preferably, the valley strip consists of moderately hard, plastically deformable polyvinyl chloride and is manufactured by extrusion. The width e of the valley strip 10 is preferably between 40 and 80 cm. It is possible for the valley strio 10 to be produced practically endlessly with a length of 10 m or more and is then sufficiently flexible that the endless valley strip can be rolled up into a roll. According to an alternative embodiment, the valley strip 10 consists of separate Pieces of determinate length, preferably between 100 and 250 cm.These valley strip pieces have at one end a ribless zone 17 see Figure 2 across the entire width, which zone ensures reliable overlapping when the individual nieces are juxtanosed, so that an absolutely water tight valley strip covering is obtained. Preferably, the linear extension of this ribles zone 17 is about from 10 to 30 cm. The thickness of the valley strip is chosen depending on the respective material and its flexural rigidity so that, on the one hand, satisfactory stability is ensured and, on the other hand,it is. possible for the zones not strengthened with ribs to take up the mechanical stresses caused by temperature variations and or the expansion and contraction of the roof structure by undergoing deformation but without splitting.If the valley strip consists, for example, of moderately hard polyvinyl chloride, the flat band 11 has a uniform thickness of preferably 1.0 to 1.5 mm over its entire width e. Ribs are formed in the central zone b on either side of the centre line a on the upper side of the flat band 11. Tluis central zone b preferably extends over 1 4 to 1 2 of the entire width e of the valley strip 10. The ribs are arranged parallel at a distance from another and extend without interruption in the longitudinal direction of the valley strip 10. All the ribs may be of uniform design. However, it is preferable to provide first narrow ribs 12, second broad ribs 13 and third low ribs 14. The majority of all the ribs is designed in the shape of the narrow ribs 12. Only the rib extending along the centre line a and also two outlying ribs adjacent the edges of the central zone b are designed as broad ribs 13. The broad centre rib facilitates the determination of the centre line a when installating the valley strip 10 and assists in improving its cross sectional rigidity. The broad ribs 13 t the edge of the central profiled portion also ensures increased cross sectional rigidity and they delimit those areas of the flat band 11 into which the distorations 18 see Figure 6 can extend in a controlled manner.The narrow ribs 12 and the broad ribs 13 have substantially the same height which corresponds approximately to between 2 and 5 times the thickness of the flat band 11. Additionally, a small number of low ribs 4 can be provided in the edge zone of the central reqion b. The low ribs 14 essentially have a visual purpose and are intended to make less harsh the transition from the central zone b into the ribless lateral zones c and they do not allow these ribless lateral zones to appear so wide. Preferably, about 16 to 24 ribs are formed in the central zone b, an equal distance being provided between each rib.Although the number and dimensions of the ribs are so chosen that, on the one hand, the valley strip 10 is also deformable in the central zone b and can be fitted to match the shape of the respective valley gutter, while, on the other hand, a durable valley gutter covering is obtained which enables relatively small gaps in the valley boarding to be readily spanned. On the valley strin 10 the ribbed central zone b is adjoined on either side by a ribless lateral zone c. As evident from Figures 3 and 4, these lateral zones c are each overlapped on the finished roof by the roofing slabs or tiles 20 bordering on the valley. In the lateral zones c the valley strip 10 merely has the thickness of the flexible band 11, so that these lateral zones c are more flexible and more readily deformable than the central zone b. The lateral zones c are intended, in particular, to take up the mechanical stresses caused by temperature variations and or the expansion and contraction of the roof structure, in which case it is possible for distorations 18 to develop, which are plainly visible see Figure 6 . The lateral zones c are adjoined in each case by the edge zones d In these edge zones d a barrier is formed which in the finished roof prevents the ingress of water, dust and or driving snow beneath the roof covering. For the formation of this barrier it is possible, for example, to fold over the flat band 11 inwards, so that a hollow fold is formed in the edge zones d. Preferably, however, the barrier is designed as a bulbous thickened portion 15 of te valley strip 10 in the edge zones d. As evident from Figures 3 and 4, the underside of those roofing tiles 20 bordering on the valley rests directly on this bulbous thickened portion 15. Preferably, a longitudinally extending nailing groove 16 is recessed inthe bulbous thickened portion 15, through which groove nails 21 are driven into the underlying valley boarding 22 or into a support batten 23 mounted theron. The height of the bulbous thickened portion 15 corresponds, preferably, to the height of the ribs 12 and 13. Figures 3 and 4 each illustrate diagrammatically a valley gutter covering according to the invention.The valley strip 10 rests in each case on the valley boarding 22. The valley boarding 22 is mounted on a valley beam 24 alternatively, the valley boarding 22 can be fastened to the rafteis25 or can be lowered between them. For fastening the valley strin 10, nails 21 are driven into the valley boarding 22, or into the support batten 23 resting on the valley boarding 22, in the vicinity of the bulbous thickened portion 15 along the nailing groove 16 the additional use of the support batten 23 Figure 4 is recommended particularly for roofs with shallow pitch. The roofing tiles 20 bordering on the valley rest with their underside on the bulbous thickened portion 15, so as to form a tight seal which reliably prevents the ingress of water, dust and or driving snow beneath the roofing.Adjacent to the thickened portion 15, the roofing tiles 20 overlap the ribless lateral zones c of the valley strip 10, so that any distortions 18 which may be formed here are not visible to an observer. In that region of the valley not overlapped by the roofing tiles only the ribbed central zone b of the valley strip 10 is visible, which zone is in close contact with the valley boarding 22, has no distortions and, therefore, always presents a neat and aesthetically attractive aonearance. Figure 5 illustrates diagrammatically the installation of a valley strip 10 composed of separate pieces. The valley boarding 22 is fastened to the valley beam 24 and to the rafters 25. An individual valley strip piece 10 is placed on the valley boarding 22, fitted to match the shape thereof and fastened by means of nails 21 in the vicinity of the bulbous thickened portion 15 along the nailing groove 16. As shown, the individual valley strip piece 10 has at one end a ribless zone 17 which extends across the entire width and in which a fluidtight overlap with the underside of the adjacent valley strip piece 10 is possible, so that a fluidtight valley gutter covering is obtained. Figure 6 illustrates diaqrammatically the formation of distortions in the valley strip. After the valley strip 10 has been fitted to match the valley gutter shape, the fastening is effected merely by means of nails 21 which in the vicinity of the bulbous thickened portion 15 along the nailing groove 16 are driven through the valley strin 10 into the valley boarding 22. In the event of shrinkage of the valley boarding 22 or thermal expansion of the valley strip 10, it is possible for the illustrated distortions 18 to develop between the fastening points.These distortions 18 develop by design in the ribless lateral zones c which in both directions exhibit relatively small moments of resistance. The spatial extension of the distortions 18 is in any case limited by the broad ribs 13 in the edge region of the central zone b, since the cross sectional rigidity of the valley strip 10 increases considerably in the region of these broad ribs 13. Since the lateral zones c are overlapped by the roofing tiles in the finished roof, the distortions 18 develop in a controlled manner in a region which is not visible to an observer. Accordinqly, even after many years under the usual stresses, the valley gutter covering of the invention still presents a neat and aesthetically attractive appearance. Finally Figures 7 and 8 each illustrate a finished roof with the valley gutter covering according to the invention. In conventional manner the roofing tiles 20 approach the valley gutter obliquely, so that the tiles have to be cut at this point and an edge composed of chiselled ends is formed. This edge overlaps with the chiselled ends the ribless lateral zones c of the valley strip 10. Accordingly, only the central zone b provided with ribs 12, 13 is visible to an observer, said central zone being free of distortions, as a result of its increased cross sectional rigidity. The central zone b forms a stable and durable lining, so that the roof can be walked on without danger in the region of the valley, even if the valley boarding 22 has small gaps.
