## Description
Anti microbial composition This invention relates to compositions with useful anti microbial properties. The present invention provides an anti microbial composition comprising a prochloraz and b bronopol Prochloraz is a known fungicide and is the approved common name for l N propyl N 2 2,4,6, trichlorophenoxy ethylcarbamoyl imidazole, and that name is used in the specification to also include salts and metal complexes of this compound. Bronopol is a known antibacterial agent and is the common name for 2 bromo 2 nitro 1,3 propanediol. We have found that the compositions of the invention have advantageous properties over the individual components and that synergism is often demonstrated, and when used in agriculture yield of crop may be increased. The weight ratios of the prochloraz to bronopol vary over a.wide range but are usually in the range 6 1 to 1 6. In addition other pesticides may be employed in conjunction with the active ingredients described above providing they do not adversely affect the interaction between the components. The cdmpositions of the invention are active against a wide range of microbes and especially fungi and bacteria which attack wood and crops such as mushrooms, fruit and cotton. Diseases that may be controlled include Verticilium spp., Mycognone spp., Hypomyces spp., Pseudomonas spp., Lenzites spp., Aspergillus spp., Penicillium spp., and Xanthomonas spp., The prochloraz is preferably in the form of a metal complex. Metal complexes are described in our BritishPatent 1,567, 521 and a particularly preferred complex is that formed with manganous chloride in which the molar ratio of prochloraz to manganese is 4 1. The compositions of the invention may be employed in many forms and are often most conveniently prepared in aqueous form immediately prior to use.One method of preparing such a composition is referred to as tank mixing in which the fungicidal ingredients in their commercially available form are mixed together by the user in a quantity of water. In addition to tank mixing immediately prior to use the compositions containing prochloraz and bronopol may be formulated into a more concentrated primary composition which is diluted with water or other diluent before use. Such compositions may comprise a surface active agent in addition to the active ingredients and examples of such compositions are as follows. It can be a dispersible solution which comprises the active ingredients dissolved in a water miscible solvent with the addition of a dispersing agent. Alternatively it can comprise the ingredients in the form of a finely ground powder in association with a dispersing agent and intimately mixed with water to give a paste or cream which can if desired be added to an emulsion of oil in water to give a dispersion of active ingredients in an aqueous oil emulsion. An emulsifiable concentrate comprises the active ingredient dissolved in a water immiscible solvent which is formed into an emulsion with water in the presence of an emulsifying agent. A granular solid comprises the active ingredients associated with powder diluents such as kaolin, which mixture is granulated by known methods. Alternatively it comprises the active ingredients adsorbed or absorbed on a pre granular diluent, for example Fuller s earth, attapulgite or limestone grit. A dispersible or wettable powder usually comprises the active ingredients in admixture with a suitable surfactant and an inert powder diluent such as china clay. Another suitable concentrate is a flowable suspension concentrate which is formed by grinding the active ingredients with water, a wetting agent and a suspending agent. In some circumstances it may be desirable to combine two types of formulation e.g. one of the components is is present in an emulsifiable concentrate and the second components is dispersed as a powder in this concentrate. The concentration of the active ingredients when used as the sole active components in a composition for direct application to the crop by conventional ground methods is preferably within the range of 0.001 to 10 per cent by weight of the composition, especially 0.005 to 5 per cent by weight, but more concentrated compositions containing up to 40 per cent may be desirable in the case of aerial sprays. As a further aspect, the invention includes a method for controlling phytopathogenic microbes which comprises applying to seeds, plants and other vegetative material or their habitat, prochloraz and bronopol either together or in sequence.Example Aqueous suspensions of prochloraz and bronopol were prepared and incorporated into agar in amounts to give the required concentration of active ingredient in the agar. The molten agar was then poured into 9 cm. Petri dishes and allowed to set. The agar in each dish was inoculated with an agar culture of Lenzites trabea and the dishes were incubated at 200C for 13 days. The colony diameters were then measured and the amount of growth expressed as a percentage of the growth observed with a control calculated. The observed growth as a percentage of control is shown in the Table.Table Observed ExpectedConcentration of Concentration of growth as growth asProchloraz ppm bronopol ppm percentage percentage of control of control E1 3.5 0 38.4 20.00 0 24.7 0 3.5 97.4 0 20.0 80.6 3.5 3.5 29.9 37.4 20.0 20.0 11.6 19.9 3.5 20.0 15.0 31.0 20.0 3.5 20.3 24.1 To indicate the existence of synergism between the active components the results were treated in the manner described by Colby 5. R. 1967 Calculating Synergistic and Antagonistic Responses of Herbicide Combinations. Weeds 15, 20 22 . The cal culated values of E1 the expected growth as a percentage of control was calculated from the equationEMI5.1 whereinX1 is the growth as a percentage of control of prochloraz at a given concentration when used alone and Y1 is the growth as a percentage of control with bronopol at a given concentration when used alone. If the observed growth is less thanE1 the results indicate synergism. In the Table above the results with the mixture do show evidence of synergism.
