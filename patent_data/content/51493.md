# HEAT EXCHANGING SYSTEM FOR AN OPEN INTERNAL COMBUSTION CYCLE

## Abstract
A heat exchanging system for a heat engine wherein compressed air or gas including air as the main part thereof is used as combustion supporting gas, working medium gas or the like and heat recovery is carried out by means of mixture which is obtained by adding liquid phase water to the compressed air or the gas including air as the main part thereof, the heat exchanging system for the open internal combustion cycle comprising a multi step air compressor intermediate cooling means, or both intermediate cool ing means and water injecting means or water contacting means located at the intermediate output of the air com pressor and liquid phase water injecting means or contacting means located at the last step output of the air compressor the heat exchanging system for the open internal combustion cycle being characterized in that the liquid phase water which is mixed with the compressed gas by means of the injecting means or contacting means is used as interme diate cooling heat medium, or both intermediate cooling heat medium and water to be injected to the intermediate compressed air.
