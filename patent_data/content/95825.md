# Process for preparing lubricating greases.

## Abstract
A process for preparing lubricating grease comprising a mixture containing from 15 to 40 by weight of polytetrafluoroethylene, from 60 to 85 by weight of a liquid dispersing medium which is a particularly defined perfluoropolyether or oligomer of trifluorochloroethylene, and 0.1 to 0.4 by weight of a perfluoroalkyl or polyoxyperfluoroalkyl surfactant and, optionally, a stabilizing and anticorrosive agent selected from polyoxyperfluoroderivatives, the mixture being subjected to grinding in order to obtain the disaggregation of the polytetrafluoroethylene granules into primary particles not larger than 1 micron.
