# VARIABLE COUPLER FIBREOPTIC SENSOR

## Abstract
A variable coupler fibreoptic sensor in which a fused, tapered, biconical directional fibreoptic coupler 13 is encap sulated in a stress birefringent medium 15 the index of refraction of which changes with applied stress. The ratio of power in the output fibres 14 of the directional coupler varies with the change of index of refraction of the encapsu lating medium as stress is applied to that medium.
