## Description
POLYMERIC COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING A POLYMER LATEX AND AN INTERNAL PLASTICIZER The present invention relates to polymeric compositions containing a polymer latex and an internal plasticizer, and which compositions are capable of producing flexible, thermoplastic polymer films. Polymer films may be produced in the form of rigid unplasticized films or as flexible films containing external plasticizers or comonomers . Typical external plasticizers for flexible films are the various phthalate, phosphate, sebacate, adipate and azelate esters of aliphatic alcohols and epoxidised oils. Some copolymerisable esters which have a vinyl unsaturation eg butyl acrylate, 2 ethyl hexyl acrylate, the fumarates and the maleates can act as internal plasticizers in polymer latices, because of their ability to lower the film forming temperature, and hence these internal plasticizers cannot migrate out of the film. However, even the polymers derived from these esters have a relatively high glass transition temperature . The glass transition temperature Tg is a temperature at which a polymeric material changes from a glassy to a rubbery behaviour.In other words this is the temperature above which molecular freezing is just overcome. Molecular freezing is an undesirable feature in polymers, especially in polymer films which are subjected to stress and strain particularly in films on substrates subject to dimensional changes. For example, the homopolymer of vinyl versatate VEOVA, Registered Trade Mark has a Tg of about 0 C whilst that of butyl acrylate is about 55 C. It has now been found that a specific group of internal plasticizers has a much lower glass transition temperature. Accordingly, the present invention is a polymeric compositon capable of forming flexible thermoplastic films and containing a polymer latex and an internal plasticizer, characterised in that the internal plasticizer comprises an adduct of the general formula I EMI2.1 wherein R is an H atom, a methyl group or an ethyl group R1 is a methyl group or an ethyl group R2 is a group selected from methyl, ethyl and phenyl groups R3 is an H atom or a C1 C4 alkyl group and n is an integer from l 20. These adducts may be prepared by initially esterifying acrylic acid or methacrylic acid with propylene oxide, propylene glycol, butylene oxide or butylene glycol to produce a monohydroxyester.Where glycols are used they are preferably 1,2 glycols. The monoester may thereafter be reacted in a step wise manner with one or more olefin oxides or glycols, or with a random mixture of dissimilar olefin oxides or glycols, or with preformed blocks of polyoxyalkylenes or polyoxyarylenes. The olefin oxide reacted with the monohydroxyester may be the same as or different from that initially reacted with the acid to produce the ester. Instead of the hydroxyester, the end product may be an ether derivative of the ester, the ether grouping preferably being a methyl or an ethyl group. The monohydroxy ester is suitably hydroxypropyl methacrylate or hydroxybutyl methacrylate, most preferably hydroxypropyl methacrylate, and may be prepared by reacting methacrylic acid with the appropriate olefin oxide. Methods of preparing this ester are claimed and described in our British patent No 1195485 and in our publishedEuropean patent application No 0014041. The adduct may thereafter be produced by reacting the hydroxypropyl methacrylate with one or more units of another olefin oxide such as propylene oxide, butylene oxide or styrene oxide. An adduct between polyoxypropylene and hydroxypropyl methacrylate is most preferred. Such an adduct has the formula II EMI3.1 and in this case n suitably represents an integer between 4 and 8. A similar adduct of the formula III EMI3.2 in which a polyoxybutylene is used can also be prepared. The number of olefin oxide units in a given adduct will depend on the end use of the polymer and on the nature of the polymer latex or emulsion itself. It is suitably between 2 and 20 preferably between 4 and 12. The homopolymer adducts of the present invention have very low glass transition temperatures Tg . For example, the Tg of the polymer of an adduct formed from hydroxypropyl methacrylate and five units of propylene oxide is below 700C. The internal plasticizers of the present invention may comprise the adducts of formula I either alone or in combination with other conventional monomers including both the so called hard and soft monomers. Examples of the hard monomers include vinyl acetate, styrene, methylmethacrylate and vinyl chloride. Examples of the soft monomers include vinyl versatate sold as VEOVA, RegisteredTrade Mark , butyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate and the like. For instance, a polymeric emulsion which traditionally uses five parts of vinyl versatate can be replaced by one part of the adduct of formula II and four parts of vinyl acetate. Specific examples of polymeric latices which may be internally plasticised by the adducts of the present invention include those derived from the polymers and copolymers of vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride, methyl methacrylate and styrene. The amount of the adduct to be used in a particular polymeric latex will depend upon the nature of the latex and the end use of the latex. As a general guide the amount of the adduct is suitably between 0.1 and 50X by weight of the total polymeric content of the latex. Unlike conventional internal plasticizing agents, the adducts aave a further advantage in that the adducts, in which R3 representsH, link with the polymer through their unsaturated linkage and still have a free hydroxyl group. The presence of a free hydroxyl group in the polymer gives an added flexibility in terms of the range of products that can be produced. For example, the free hydroxyl group may be cross linked with melamine formaldehyde resins, isocyanates and the like.
