## Abstract
A liquid dispenser 10 for dispensing a volumetric quantity of liquid 26 is disclosed. The dispenser 10 includes a plunger 11 having a longitudinal axis 30 . First and second umbrella seals 14 and 15 are cooperatively connected to the plunger 11 . The seals 14 and 15 are in spaced relationship. A plunger housing 16 encloses at least a portion of the plunger 11 . The plunger housing 16 is adapted for relative movement with the plunger 11 along the longitudinal axis 30 . The plunger housing 16 has an inner cavity 19a having a first opening 19b and a second opening 19c , wherein a measuring chamber is defined between the seals. Relative movement along the longitudinal axis 30 is effected between the plunger 11 and the plunger housing 16 , wherein the plunger 11 moves from a filling to a dispensing position. When in the filling position, the second seal 15 seals the second opening 19 c and the first seal 14 allows liquid 26 to enter the measuring chamber 19a through the first opening 19b . When in the dispensing position, the first seal 14 seals the first opening 19b and the second seal 15 allows liquid 26 to be dispensed by gravity from the second opening 19c . The first seal 14 always is in a sealing relationship to the first opening 19b when the second seal 15 allows dispensing of the liquid 26 , whereby a constant volume of liquid 26 is dispensed.
