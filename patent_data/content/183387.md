## Description
A CRYSTALLINE ZIRCONIUM PHOSPHATE AND A METHOD OF PREPARING THE SAME The present invention relates to a crystalline zirconium phosphate and a method of preparing the same. Crystalline zirconium phosphates are known to exhibit a capacity for ion exchange. Alpha zirconium phosphate Zr HP04 2.H20 is known to have a small interlayer radius 7.6 angstroms which results in slow exchange of cations having a large ionic radius such as Cs , Ba2 and hydrated Mg2 . A more highly hydrated form of zirconium phosphate, theta, variously reported as Zr HP04 2.8H20 and Zr HPO4 2. 6H20, exhibits improved cation exchange properties probably owing to its greater interlayer spacing of 10.4 angstroms Clearfield et al., J.Inorg.Nuc. Chem., 1964, Vol. 26, pp. 117 to 129, Pergamon Press . The anhydrous phase of zirconium phosphate Zr HPO4 2, known as beta zirconium phosphate, and the dihydrate phase, gamma zirconium phosphate Zr HPO4 2.2 4O also exhibit greater interlayer distance than the alpha form with d spacings of 9.4 and 12.2 angstroms, respectively Clearfield et al., J. Inorg. Nuc. Chem.1968, Vol. 30 pp. 2249 2258, Pergamon Press . Like the theta form, anhydrous and beta zirconium phosphates are capable of ion exchanging bulky cations at a greater rate than the alpha form. The above zirconium phosphates are normally prepared by addition of a soluble salt of zirconium to a solution of phosphoric acid or a soluble sulfate. In the presence of an excess of the phosphorus derivative, i.e., P Zr mole ratio 2, a gel is formed which crystallizes when the reactant mixture is maintained at elevated temperature for an extended time, say about 48 hours.Other methods of producing zirconium phosphates are set out in U.S.Patent Nos. 3,056,647 3,485,763 4,025,608 and 4,381,289. Although the resulting materials exhibit a significant ion exchange capability, they suffer from limitations in thermal stability. At temperatures above about 3000C such materials are subject to losses in sorption and surface acidity. Zirconium phosphonates have been prepared by reacting organics such as ethylene oxide with the acidic hydroxyl of the layered zirconium phosphate to convert the inorganic acid hydroxyls to bound organic alkanol groups see, e.g. Yamaka, Inorg. Chem 15, 2811, 1976 . Other phosphonates of zirconium including zirconium bis benzenephosphonate , zirconium b is hydroxymethanephosphonate monohydrate and zirconium bis monoethylphosphonate have been prepared Alberti et al., J. Inorg. Nucl. Chem., 40, 1113 1978 .U.S. Patent No. 4,298,723 describes a process for preparing layered materials similar in structure to zirconium phosphates, in which a source of zirconium such as zirconyl chloride is combined with an organophosphorus acid compound of the formula HO 2OP R, n wherein n is 1 or 2 and R may be an acyclic group, heteroacyclic group containing one or more heteroatoms selected from 0, N, and S, a cyclic group, aromatic group, or a heterocyclic group containing one or more heteroatoms selected from 0, N and S. The organo groups occupy an average surface area not greater than about 24 square angstroms in each section bounded by four zirconium atoms. The resulting layered materials exhibit improved thermal stability over conventional zirconium phosphates. It has now been found that crystalline zirconium phosphates of high thermal stability and sorption capacity can be prepared by including a bulky organic cations having a molecular weight of at least about 100 in a forming mixture which contains a source of zirconium and a source of phosphorus. Accordingly, the invention resides in one aspect in a crystalline zirconium phosphate compound having the composition xA YM2 mO ZrO2 zP2 WH2 where A is an organic cation having a molecular weight of at least 100 M is a cation of valence m O xc4 O y 6 O zc3 Owt20 and having the X ray diffraction lines of Table 1 of the specification. Table 1 d space 2 theta I Io 11.33 0.1 7.79 m 3.89 0.05 22.87 s 3.29 0.03 27.05 vs 3.14 0.03 28.45 w m 2.66 0.02 33.71 w 2.63 0.02 34.10 w with I Io from 0 to 24 w weak , from 25 to 49 m medium , from 50 to 74 s strong , and from 75 to 100 vs very strong . In a further aspect, the invention resides in a method for preparing a crystalline zirconium phosphate compound having theX ray diffraction lines of Table 1 of the specification and the composition xA yM2 mO ZrO2 zP2O5 wH2O where A is an organic cation having a molecular weight of at least 100 M is a cation of valence m O x 4 O y 6 Okz 3 and O w 20 wherein a phosphorus source selected from water soluble phosphates and phosphoric acid is combined with a salt of said organic cation, and thereafter combined with a source of zirconium under crystallization conditions. Preferably, 0.01 x 2, 1 y 4, 0.5 Z 2 and 0 w 10. Cations of onium compounds are particularly useful in preparing zirconium phosphates of the present invention. Onium compounds which may be used include those having the following formula RpM Xwherein R is alkyl of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms,heteroalkyl of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl of from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, cycloheteroalkyl, of from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, or combinations thereof p is 1 to 4, preferably 4 M is a quadricoordinate element e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony or bismuth or a heteroatom e.g., N, O, S, Se, P, As, etc. in an alicyclic, heteroalicyclic or heteroaromatic structure and X is an anion e.g., fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, hydroxide, acetate, sulfate, carboxylate, etc. .When M is a heteroatom in an alicyclic, heteroalicyclic or heteroaromatic structure, the cation RpM may be, as non limiting examples,EMI4.1 orEMI4.2 wherein R is alkyl of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, heteroalkyl of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl of from 3 to 6 carbon atoms or cycloheteroalkyl of from 3 to 6 carbon atoms. In particular, tetraalkylammonium and tetraalkylphosphonium compounds have been found to be useful onium compounds, e.g., tetrapropylammonium bromide and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide.Compounds containing multiple cat ionic centers including cationic polymers known as ionomers, may also be used such as those having the formula R 3M Z nM R 3 y XÂ¼ 2n where y 1 wherein R, M and X are as above defined, Z is a bridging member selected from alkyl of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, alkenyl of from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, aryl, heteroalkyl of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, heteroalkenyl of from 2 to 20 carbon atoms and heteroaryl, and n from 1 to 50.Non limiting examples of such multiple cationic center containing compounds include CH3 3As CH2 6N CH3 3 ClÂ¼ 2, C3H7 3N CH2 10N C3H7 3 ClÂ¼ 2, C6H5 3N C2H4 16P C6H5 3 OHÂ¼ 2, C18H37 3P C2H2 3P CH3 3 ClÂ¼ 2, C2H5 3N C6H4 N C2H5 3 BrÂ¼ 2, CH3 3Sb CH2 10Sb CH3 3 ClÂ¼ 2, C6H5 3Sb CH2 4N CH3 3 OHÂ¼ 2, C2H3 3N CH2 50N C2H3 3 OHÂ¼ 2, C6H5 3P C2H2 6As CH3 3 ClÂ¼ 2, CH3 3N CH2 6N CH3 3 ClÂ¼ 2, andEMI5.1 The cation may also be the cation of an organic phosphorus salt such as those disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,209,449 and 4,336,385 and available from Mona Industries, Paterson, N.J., U.S.A.Broadly speaking, such salts are of the formula EMI5.2 wherein R is an amidoamine moiety of the formulaEMI5.3 R1 is alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, or hydroalkyl of from 5 to 22 carbon atoms each, or aryl or alkary of up to 20 carbon atoms, R2 is hydrogen or alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or alkenyl of up to 6 carbon atoms each or cycloalkyl of up to 6 carbon atoms, preferably of from 2 to 5 carbon atoms, or polyoxyalkalene of up to 10 carbon atoms R and R4, which may be the same or different, are selected from alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, carboxyalkyl of up to 6 carbon atoms in each alkyl moiety, and polyoxyalkylene of up to 10 carbon atoms in addition, R3 and R4 taken together with the nitrogen to which they are attached, may represent an N containing heterocycle n is an integer from 2 to 12 and X is an anion. In a particularly preferred embodiment, R1 is C5 toC17 alkyl, f is H, R3 and R4 are methyl and n 3. In another preferred embodiment R1 is C11 to C13 alkyl and X isC1. In another embodiment, R may beEMI6.1 and R5 is C5 to C17 alkyl, say, for example, C12 alkyl, andX is C1. In still another embodiment the phosphorus containing salt may comprise a zwitterion, for example, materials such asEMI6.2 may be included in the forming mixture. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the surfactant and directing properties of the organic cation, as well as its ability to ion exchange during synthesis, advantageously affect the gelation of the reactant mixture, the rheology of the obtained gel phase, as well as gel crystallization.The bulkiness of the cation serve to keep the layers far apart during the reaction. Suitable sources of zirconium for use in the method of the invention include water soluble zirconium compounds such as zirconyl chloride, ZrOC1.8 z 0. Suitable phosphorus sources include water soluble phosphates or hydrogen phosphates such as NaHO4.H20, organophosphorus compounds, phosphorus oxides, and phosphoric acid.Preferably, the bulky organic cationic compound is combined with the phosphorus source, e.g., Na g P04. 0 and where necessary, solution is effected by adding an acid solution such as 3N HC1. The resulting mixture can then be refluxed, during which time the source of zirconium, e.g., a 1M ZrOC12.8H20 solution, is gradually added. The P Zr molar ratio of the resulting forming mixture, exclusive of added organic cation, is greater than 2. Upon addition of zirconium a gel is formed. Crystallization of the gel results from its exposure to refluxing conditions or by autoclaving.Temperatures greater than about 700C, preferably 9O0C to 150 C, may be used in effecting crystallization. The pressure may be atmospheric, autogeneous, or any suitable crystallization pressure ranging from 100 to 3040 kPa 1 to 30 atm . Depending on the particular conditions employed, crystallization time can range from 1 to 500 hours. In those situations where an alkali metal containing phosphorus salt is used as the phosphorus source e.g., a sodium salt of phosphoric acid, some or all ion exchange sites of the resulting crystalline zirconium phosphate material will be exchanged with alkali metal. In order to convert such material to the proton exchanged form, the as synthesized crystalline zirconium phosphate is acid washed. Proton exchange is preferably achieved by contacting the material to be exchanged, with a mixture of hydrochloric and or phosphoric acid, followed by rinsing with distilled water. Upon crystallization and any subsequent treatment such as proton exchange or ammonium exchange, the crystalline material is dried. The drying step may be in any suitable atmosphere, including vacuum or air at temperatures ranging from 50 to 2000C, say about 1200C. The dried crystalline zirconium phosphate may then be exposed to thermal treatment, i.e, calcined in an inert gas atmosphere, such as nitrogen or helium, and or in an oxygen containing atmosphere, e.g., air. Suitable calcining temperatures can range from 200 to 6000C, preferably 2500C or 5000C. Such treatment results in removal of at least some of the organic cation present in the structure of the zirconium phosphate. The calcined materials exhibit thermal stability at temperatures of 4000C or even higher. In addition, these materials possess strong acid sites and enhanced surface acidity.Accordingly, the zirconium phosphate materials of the present invention are significantly better than prior art zirconium phosphates which exhibit poor thermal stability and reduction in surface acidity when exposed to temperatures above 3000C. Thus, the present zirconium phosphates may be used as ion exchangers or catalysts under a wide variety of operating conditions and temperatures. For example, they may be used in their acid form for acid catalyzed reactions. Ion exchange of the zirconium phosphate with metal ions yields a catalyst suitable for oxidation or base catalyzed reactions. The zirconium phosphate of the present invention may also be employed as a catalyst for converting organic compounds In addition, the product of the invention may be used as a catalyst binder owing to its thermal stability. Examples 1 10 Preparation of Zirconium Phosphates A series of zirconium phosphate compounds, ZP l throughZP 10 were prepared in accordance with Table 2. ZP 1 and ZP 9 were conventionally prepared in the absence of bulky organic ions in the forming mixture.

The crystallized sodium exchanged product was then filtered and washed.Sodium ion was proton exchanged by acid washing in 2 N HC1 and 0.2 MH3P04 followed by rinsing with distilled water. The acid form of the zirconium phosphate was then dried in an oven at 1200C. Example 11 Thermal Stability of Zirconium Phosphate X ray diffraction patterns of ZP 4, a zirconium phosphate prepared from a forming mixture which contains tetrapropylammonium bromide were obtained by standard techniques for as synthesizedZP 4, ZP 4 calcined at 3500C, and ZP 4 calcined at 5000C. The X ray diffractograms were substantially the same except for minor shifts in interplanar spacing and variation in relative intensity. Thus, it is seen that ZP 4 is thermally stable even at temperatures of 5000C. Example 12 X Ray Diffraction Pattern of Treated ZP 4 ZP 4 was treated with NaOH according to the following procedure 1 Add 1.0g ZP 4 as synthesized to 130mug NaOH in 200m1 water.2 Stir for 3 hours at ambient temperature.3 Filter, without washing, and dry at 1000C. Another sample of ZP 4 was treated with dimethylsilane by heating 2.09 ZP 4 to 2500C 50 min , while flowing dimethylsilane continuously through the reactor at 60 cc min. X ray diffraction patterns of the samples were then obtained by conventional methods. A comparison of the two patterns showed that the crystalline structure was essentially maintained, as minor shifts only occurred in interplanar spacings. Furthermore, the uptake of dimethylsilane, a material which is relatively inert to weakly acidic conditions, indicates the presence of very strong acid sites in the partially protonated form of ZP 4. Example 13 Reproducibility of ZP 4 Synthesis Another batch of ZP 4 was prepared according to the procedure of Example 4. A comparison of X ray diffraction patterns of the materials of Examples 4 and 13, indicated the reproducibility of the synthesis product.
