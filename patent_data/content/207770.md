## Description
THERMOINDUCIBLE PLASMTD This invention relates to novel thermoinducible chimeric plasmids, especially plasmids derived from pBR322 but with the replicon exchanged for a thermoinducible replicon, and in particular to one such plasmid desiqnated pKG 2. Plasmid pKG 2 is constructed by replacinq a portion of miniplasmid pVU208 derived from parent CloDF13 with a portion of the well known pBR322 plastriid. The usefulness of plastrilds as cloninq vectors in genetic enqineerinq is well estahlished, as is the preparation of new plasmids by combininq portions of known plea skids containing desirable characteristics.Also, the use of thermoinducible or runaway plasmids for overproduction of gene products is well documented see for example Uhlin, B.E., et al., Gene, 6, 1979 pp.91 106, and U.S. Patents 4,487,835, 4,495,287 and 4,499,189. pBR322 is one of the most commonly used plasmid vectors its entire nucleotide sequence is known seeSutcliffe, J.G., Cold Spring Harb. Sump. Quant. Biol., 43 1978 pp. 77 90 it has resistance to both ampicillin and tetracycline. The invention provides a runaway plasmid comprising a substantial part of the DNA sequence of plasmid pBR322 but lacking the replicon thereof, and containinq a thermoinducible replicon. The novel plasmid has a controlled copy number at relatively low temperatures, e.q. around 300C, but an unrelated copy number at hiqher temperatures, e.g. it starts to show runaway behavior at 34 350C and shows marked runaway behavior at 37 400C. This lasmid is stable under replication conditions, i.e. it is not lost. Whereas most of the research directed at thermoinducible plasmids has been based on plasmids derived from R1, a substantial effort has been directed at plasmids derived from CloDF 13y see for exampleNijkamp, H.J.J., et al., Molecular Biology, Pathoqenicity and Ecoloqy of Bacterial Plasmids, ed. Levy, S. NewYork Plenum Publishers, 1981 pp. 247 258, and Stuitje,A.R., et al., Nature, 290 1981 pp. 264 267. CloDF 13 was originally isolated from Enterobacter cloacae, but is maintained in Escherichia coli Veltkamp, E,, et al.,B.B.A., 425 1976 pp. 356 367 , and shares many properties of the ColE1 type plasrrtid. Since it is non conjuqative and poorly mobilized, CloDF 13 is well suited for use as a cloninq vector.The complete nucleotide sequence of the reqion essential for plasmid replication has been published and a series of specific mutants displaying thermosensitive plasmid copy numbers has been described see Stuitje et al., supra. The CloDF 13 miniplasmid pVU208 used as the starting replicon Hakkaart, M.J., et al., Mol. Gen.Genet., 183 1981 pp. 326 332 contains an integrated ampicillin transposon Tn 901 , is Clo , Imm , and mitomycin C sensitive, and displays a copl temperaturesensitive phenotype as a result of a GA base transition at position 205 bp downstream from the Bam HI site. This copl phenotype allows for a modest plasmid copy number at about 300C and a greatly elevated plasmid copy number at temperatures above about 350C. The plasmid of the present invention preferably has such a modified Clo replicon as thermoinducible replicon, in particular the replicon of plasmid pVU208. The Clo replicon is derived from a cloacin plasmid such as CloDF 13. A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described in conjunction with the sinqle Fiqure 1 in the accompanyinq drawing, which illustrates the construction of pKG 2 by reference to restriction endonuclease cleavage maps of pBR322 and pVU208. AmpR and TcR refer to qenes conferrinq resistance to ampicillin and tetracycline respectively, and rep refers to origin of veqetative replication the restriction endonuclease cleavaqe sites indicated are described below. Plasmid pKG 2 is constructed as shown in Figure 1 by replacing approximately 1.9 Kb of the non essential region of pVU208 plasmid with the 2.2 Kb PstI AvaI fragment from pBR322 containing the tetracycline resistance operon and that part of the B lactamase gene required to reconstitute ampicillin resistance. In other words, an approximately 1.4 Kb PstI AvaI fragment ofPVU208 including replicon is listed with the approximately 2.2 Kb PstI AvaI fragment of pBR322 without replicon . This newly constructed 3.6 Kb nlasrnid displays all of the thermoinducible properties of the parent replicon as well as an array of unique cloning and insertion inactivation sites found in pBR322.Plasmid pKG 2 is remarkably stable and replicates ina predictable manner in a qiven bacterial host. Unique cleavage sites for restriction endonucleases in pKG 2 include the following Restriction enzyme Number of Cleavage Sites Bam HI 1 PstI 1 EcoRI 1 Ava I 1Bam HI is isolated from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, PstI from Providencia stuartii, EcoRI from Escherichia coli, and Ava I from Anabaena variabilis. Plasmid pKG 2 was deposited with the AmericanType Culture Collection ATCC in Rockville, Md., U.S.A.on June 13, 1985, under deposit number ATCC 53148. A multicopy plasmid such as pKG 2 can be used to make a bacterial cell overproduce a qiven gene product by cloninq a foreiqn DNA fragment containing the gene of interest into the plasmid together with an appropriate requlatory sequence and transforming the plasmid into the host i.e. bacterial cell. Using conventional techniques, the host cell is cultured and the desired gene product is harvested. Specifically, the pKG 2 plasmid has been used as a vector into which a number of important eucaryotic qenes have been inserted to augment the production of eucaryotic genes or gene products, e.g. proteins, in a bacterium specifically Escherichia coli E. coli . For example, Table 1 shows the increase in production obtained when several interferon qenes with their appropriate bacterial promoters, ribosome binding sites and 3 non codinq tail regions were excised from their pBR322 derived parents and introduced into pKG 2. In each case a 12 50 fold increase in interferon titer was observed over that of the parental construction.This over production was due solely to the increased plasmid copy number associated with the runaway phenotype, since the bacterial host, media, length of the fermentation, final coil densities and the regulator reqion of the interferon operon were constant.

Gen. Genet., 151 1977 , pp. 151 160 . 2 Relative activity was determined by the cytopathic ef fect inhibition assay employing EMC virus and human foreskin cells. Using NIH WHO natural leukocyte interferon as a standard, the assay was performed essentially as described by Familletti, P.C., et al., in A Convenient and Rapid Cytopathic Effect Inhibition Assay for Interferon, Methods in Enzymology, Peska, S., ed. New York Academic Press, 1980 , pp. 387 394. 3 Growinq culture was shifted from 300C to 410C for a specified time period, e.q. about 2 hours, and then downshifted from 410C to 300C for another specified time period, e.g. 2 3 hours. In each instance the growth medium consisted of 20 q Tryptone, 10 q Yeast Extract, 5 q NaCl, and 10 mg tetracycline per liter. The followinq polypeptides inter alia have also been overproduced by plasmid pKG 2 or derivatives thereof in a variety of E. coli hosts murine interleukin 2 murine interleukin 3 murine and human G M CSF ranulocyte macrophaqe colony stimulating factor and human y interferon A. Plasmid pKG 2 is constructed by techniques well known in molecular bioloqy. Strains of the startinq plasmids, pVU208 and pBR322, are grown and plasmid DNA is isolated by conventional techniques, then recombined by known methods, e.g. by diqestion of each plasmid with appropriate restriction enzymes, separation of each resultant mixture, isolation of each desired fragment, libation of these fraqments, transformation into suitable host cells and finally qrowth and isolation of the pKG 2 plasmid. Those skilled in the art will recognize that there are many methods for prenarinq plasmids. An example of such a method for the preparation of the plasmid of this invention, pKG 2, is as follows Each startinq plasmid is grown overniqht in E. coli at 300C at 300 rpm on a rotary shaker in a medium known as 20 10 5 which comprises 20 gmTryptone, 10 qm yeast extract and 5 qm of sodium chloride per liter.The resultant plasmids are isolated from stationary cultures by the cleared lysate method followed byCesium Chloride Ethidium Bromide buoyant density centrifugation the ethidium bromide is removed from the plasmid with cesium chloride saturated isopropanol, and the plasmid is precipitated twice in ethanol and resuspended in pHS TE buffer i.e. 10 mM tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane HC1, 0.5 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid at 1 mq l ml. pVU208 plasmid is then digested with PstI and Avail restriction endonucleases and the resultant material electrophoresed on a 0.78 aqarose qel. The approximately 1.4 kb fragment containing the runaway origin of replication and part of the ampicillin gene is excised, eluted by electrophoresis, precipitated with ethanol and retained.The pBR322 plasmid is similarly treated to isolate the 2.2 kb fragment containinq the tetracycline gene and the other part of the ampicillin gene. The isolated fragments are liqated in the presence of T4 DNA ligase according to wellknown procedures, and the liqation mixture transformed intoE. coli 294 usinq the calcium chloride procedure described by Daqert and Ehrlich Gene, 6 1979 p. 23 28 . The transformation mixture is plated into 20 10 5 aqar plates containinq tetracycline 10 mcq ml and ampicillin 40 mcq ml . Using conventional techniques, the resultant colonies are miniprepped prepared on a small scale and the plasmid with the desired construction, i.e. the structure of pKG 2, is isolated. Additional methods for the isolation, purification, transformation and selection of plasmids are described in many publications, e.g. T. Maniatis et al.,Molecular Cloning Cold Sprinq Harbor Cold Spring HarborLaboratory, 1982 .
