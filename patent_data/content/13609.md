## Description
TITLEMONOAZO DYES This invention relates to monoazo dyes and their application to textile materials. According to the invention, there are provided water soluble monoazo dyes which, in the form of the free acids, have the formula EMI2.1 in which rings A and B may carry other substituents, X represents hydrogen, carboxy or sulpho, RÚ represents C1 4alkyl or aryl, R2 represents hydrogen or optionally substituted C1 4alkyl, v represents hydrogen, halogen, C1 4alkyl, C14alkoxy, cyano or carboxy and R represents hydrogen, halogen, C14alkyl or sulpho, the substituents being such that the dye molecule contains either one or two sulpho groups. Other substituents which may be present on ring A in addition to those shown in the formula include halogen atoms, especially chlorine and bromine, C1 4alkyl, C1 4alkoxy and cycloalkyl radicals. Other substituents which may be present on ring B include halogen atoms, especially chlorine and bromine, C1 4alkyl, C14alkoxy, sulpho and carboxy radicals. Substituents which may be present on the optionally substituted alkyl radicals represented by R2 include cyano, carbamoyl and carboxy radicals. R1 is preferably methyl or phenyl. The dyes of the invention preferably contain one sulphonic acid group and this is preferably X or Particularly valuable dyes within the scope ofFormula I have a single sulphonic acid group and are represented by the formula EMI3.1 in which ring A carries no additional substituents, Z represents hydrogen or chlorine, R is methyl or phenyl and R2, S and R4 are hydrogen. The dyes of the invention may be prepared by diazotising a primary amine of the formula EMI3.2 and coupling the resulting diazo compound with an indole coupling component of the formula EMI3.3 the symbols A, B, X, R1 R2, R3 and R4 having the meanings given above, the primary amine and the coupling component together containing either one or two sulphonic acid groups. Primary amines of Formula III may be prepared by condensing a nitro or acylaminobenzenesulphonyl chloride of the formula EMI4.1 asith a phenol of the formula EMI4.2 under alkaline conditions followed by reduction of the nitro group or acid hydrolysis of the acylamino group.In Formula V, the symbol Q represents a nitro or acylamino group and ring B nay be substituted as previously stated.In Formula VI, the symbol X has the meaning given above and ring A may be substituted as previously stated. Suitable sulphonyl chlorides of Formula V include p acetylaminobenzenesulphonyl chloride1 2 methyl 5 acetylaminobenzenesulphonyl chloride, 3 and 4 nitrobenzenesulphonyl chlorides, 2 rethoxy 5 acetylan.inobenzene sulphonyl chloride, and 3 chloro 4 acetylaminobenzenesulphonyl chloride. Suitable phenols of Formula VI include phenol, on m and p cresols, 2,5 dimethylphenol, 2,6 dimethylphenol, 2,4 dimethylphenol, p tertiarybutylphenol, p amylphenol, 4 cyclohexylphenol, 4 chlorophenol, 2 methoxyphenol, 4 methoxyphenol, phenol 4 sulphonic acid and p hydroxybenzoic acid. Suitable coupling components of Formula IV include 2 methylindofe, 2 phenylindole, 2 methylindole 5sulphonic acid and 2 phenylindole 5 sulphonic acid. The reactions leading to the formation of the dyes of the invention may be performed using conditions that have been fully described in the prior art for such reaction.Similarly, the dyes may be isolated by known methods and, as in the case of other dyes containing sulphonic acid groups, it is often convenient to isolate and use the dyes in the form of their water soluble salts, particularly their alkali metal or ammonium salts and especially sodium salts. Tt is te be understood that the invention relates to both the free aeids anc their salts. The dyes of the invention are suitable for applying to polyamide textile materials such as wool and silk but especially to synthetic polyamide textile materials, for example nylon 66 and nylon 6, using any of the general methods kn wn for the application cf acid dyes to such materials.The 9yes provide yellow to orange shades having a high degree of fastness to wet treatments and to light. The invention is illustrated but not limited by the following Examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight.Example 1 A solution of 4. parts of sodium nitrite in 30 parts of water is added to a solution of 15 parts of 4 phenoxysulphonylaniline in 300 parts of glacial acetic acid and 30 parts of 35 hydrochloric acid a v 3 5vC. Stirring is continued at 0 50C for 7 flour and tbe diazo solution is then added to a stirred solution of 13.2 parts of the sodium salt of 2 methylindole 5 sulphonic acid 88 strength in 500 parts of water at 05O0. Saturated sodium acetate solution is then added to adjust the pH to 4 and stirring is continued at 0 50C for 2 hours and then at 200C for a further 20 hours.The precipitatelis then filtered off, resuspended in 500 parts of water at 200C and 32 sodium hydroxide solution is then added to adjust the pH to 9.100 Parts of sodium chloride are added and the dyestuff is then filtered off, washed with 20 brine solution and dried. then applied to nylon 66 from a weakly acid bath, a strong yellow shade is obtained which exhibits very good wet fastness and light fastness.
