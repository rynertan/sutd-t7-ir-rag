# THERMOPLASTIC POWER TRANSMISSION BELTS

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a thermoplastic transmis sion belt having a reinforcing element in the form of a tape and an apparatus for performing the method. In the manufacture of such belting a thermoplastic body is extruded around the reinforcing element. In order to overcome problems of excessive stretch or insufficient strength, the reinforcing tape 1a is preheated before the thermoplastic body is extruded therearound. Furthermore, the tape is maintained in tension as it passes through the preheating station 4 , the extruding station 5 and the subsequent cooling station 6 . A constant tension is ensured by applying a discrete load 2a to the tape.
