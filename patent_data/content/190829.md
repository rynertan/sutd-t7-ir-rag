# OPTICAL SENSOR FOR MONITORING THE PARTIAL PRESSURE OF OXYGEN

## Abstract
A device is described for sensing oxygen, particularly for use in medical applications. The device includes an optical waveguide and an oxygen sensing medium disposed on the waveguide. The sensing medium fluoresces in response to light from a light source such that the intensity of fluoresc ence is dependent on the partial pressure of oxygen in the environment. The sensing medium includes an oxygen sensitive fluorescent dye in a matrix consisting of a plasti cized polymer.
