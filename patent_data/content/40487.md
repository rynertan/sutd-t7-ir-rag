# Method of regenerating phosphoric acid extraction solvent.

## Abstract
Organic phosphate solvents used in the extraction of phosphoric acid from impure phosphoric acid solutions, and from which the phosphoric acid has been stripped, are washed with an aqueous alkali orthophosphate solution to remove impurities, particularly silica, fluorine and organic impurities, from the solvent prior to re use.
