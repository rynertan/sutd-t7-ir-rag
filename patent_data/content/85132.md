# Photographic system with slow burn flash bulb.

## Abstract
A photographic system for minimizing exposure track ing error under flash illumination using a low cost camera in which an automatic shutter system constitutes the sole control of exposure illumination passed to the film. The source of flash illumination is a low cost filament combusti ble flash bulb in which the effective burn time is increased without change in total illumination energy to the maximum interval of exposure time compatible with hand held camera operation. The reduced maximum intensity and lengthened burn time reduces the proportionate amount of exposure illumination during shutter closing movement and, conse quently, the deleterious effect of variation in shutter closing movement so that exposure with varying camera subject distances and flash illumination is relatively unaffected.

## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to photographic apparatus and, more particularly, it concerns a photographic system by which photographic film may be properly and uniformly exposed over a range of camera subject distances using a combustible filament flash bulb.Completely outomatic photographic cameras in which the photographer need only aim the camera at a subject to be photographed and press a button to achieve proper exposure of camera contained film, assuming the design limits of the camera and film are not exceeded, are well knwon. Since the operating range, and correspondingly, the refinements available in a photographic camera are based largely on the size of the camera lens aperture, low cost cameras in particular commonly employ relatively small maximum lens apertures on the order of f li or smaller, to yield a relatively large depth of field, particularly when a fixed focus lens is employed.Film exposure is effected by an electronically controlled shutter system in which shutter speed and aperture size variation are governed by a photoresponsive cell and appropriate circuitry built into the camera. Electronically controlled shutter systems of this type are well known and sufficiently developed. Relatively small maximum lens aperatures require more extensive use of artificial illumination.Such cameras may be equipped to receive disposable, cumbustible filament flash bulbs, or arrays of such bulbs, in which illumination energy is fixed.In such cameras, exposure control with flash illumination is often predicated solely on the electronic shutter system together with other fixed design parameters of the camera and of the flash illumination source. In this respect, two basic difficulties regarding control of film exposure are presented namely, the establishing the uniformity of the time interval required for the shutter to close after a photometrically generated close command signal is generated, and the variations in intensity of flash illumination in such flash bulbs. The result of improper film exposure by flash illumination is referred to as tracking error and is manifested by overexposure where the camera subject distance is less than a design norm or by underexposure where the subject is farther from the camera than the average distance for which the camera and flashlamp are designed.Heretofore, the problems associated with tracking error using shutter control of flash illumination has been substantially avoided by compensating the circuitry of the electronic shutter control system. The circuitry typically includes a light integrating circuit to control the time interval between opening of the shutter and the command signal for closing of the shutter as a function of the time integral of light intensity received by a photocell, or equivalent, subsequent to the shutter opening. As disclosed for example inU.S. Patent No. 3,200,723, the circuitry may be modified to shorten the timing interval of the circuit by adding a fixed resistance when flash illumination is used.Basically, the series addition of a fixed resistance to the capacitor and the variably resistive photocell in a battery poweredRC timing circuit reduces the time required to reach a trigger voltage i.e., the shutter closing command signal . The added fixed resistance has the effect of increasing the initial voltage IR which increases to the trigger voltage at a rate determined by the photocell resistance which, in turn, varies inversely with the intensity of light thereon. Since the rate of voltage increase is nearly constant, the added fixed resistance used only during a flash exposure mode shortens the effective timing interval of the RC circuit so that initiation of shutter closing is advanced to compensate for the characteristics of flash illumination.Such compensation circuits vary only the timing of the closing command signal, and the actual time required for complete shutter closure after the signal remains unchanged. This solution is acceptable where the closing time is sufficiently predictable. However, the latter requires relatively costly shutter design and manufacturing control to minimize the variation in shutter closing time from camera to camera. With the development of faster film speeds, the tracking error in a flash operational mode is often such that acceptable limits in the tracking error cannot be economically achieved by compensation of the shutter control circuit alone. With more sensitive films, variations in the amount of exposure intensity during shutter closing have a more noticeable effect on film exposure. Films of higher speed also require less light, and if overall cost criteria are to be met, the amount of flash illumination energy supplied by a flash bulb should be reduced.Where the total energy of the flash illumination is reduced to accomodate the higher speed films, however, the intensity time curve of incandescent of combustible lamps approaches an isosceles triangle in which light intensity increases at a relatively constant rate during the first half of the time duration of illumination and then decreases at essentially a similar rate during the second half of the time interval. Increased tracking error then occurs as a result of widely varying areas illumination energy under the intensity time curve for different increments of the same time lag shutter closing time over the total duration of flash illumination. In other words, the effect of the shutter closing can result in unacceptable overexposure at short camera subject distances and underexposure at longer than normal camera subject distances.To reduce this tracking error by increasing the fixed resistance of the anticipation circuit leads to an unacceptably large resistance and also still falls short of providing a complete solution.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn accordance with the present invention, a photographic system is provided by which tracking error in exposure by flash illumination is substantially avoided by a flash system of a fixed illuminating capacity having a selected burn time, defined by the time interval during which illumination intensity is maintained at least at one half the maximum intensity for a short time, approximately equal to the longest interval of exposure compatible with hand held camera operation. The combination of limited intensity and length of burn time in the flash bulb provides a highly economic system having a relatively small quantity of illumination passing to the film during intervals of shutter closing movement, irrespective of shutter speeds needed for proper exposure. This result, in turn, leads to proper film exposure with flash illumination throughout the design range camera subject distances.A principal object of the present invention is, therefore, the provision of an improved flash photographic system which provides proper exposure with flash illumination over varying distances. Another object is to provide a flash camera system having an optimized flash burn time. Other objects and further applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description to follow taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which like parts are designated by like reference numerals.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFig 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating a camera constructed in accordance with the present invention Fig. 2 is a diagram showing anticipation circuitry in the shutter system of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a graph illustrating the results of anticipation circuitry shown in Fig. 2 Fig. 4 is a graph illustration representative of exposure illumination during shutter closing movement with a conventional source of flash illumination andFig. 5 is a graph similar to Fig. 4, but illustrating exposure illumination in accordance with the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTFig. 1 of the drawings schematically illustrates basic functioning components of a camera in block diagram form. A camera system is shown to include a objective lens 10 for example, a fixed focus lens adapted to be supported from a lens board 12 defining a fixed maximum lens aperture 14. The size of the aperture 14 determines the depth of focus or range of camera subject distances within which the light image of a subject to be photographed in focused by the lens 10 at a film plane 16. The film strip is supported within the dark chamber of a camera body not shown .While the size of the aperature 14 may be varied to accomodate different film speeds as well as variations in the shortest camera subject distance contemplated by the design of the system, the diameter of the fixed aperture 14 preferably does not exceed f 19 for a film speed ASA 600 in a camera intended for use with a minimum camera subject distance of 1,20 m.The size of the aperture 14 may however by reduced of f 27 to achieve focusing down to 60 cm with the same film speed.The amount of image light passing from the lens 10 to the film plane 16 along an optical axis 15 is, controlled by an automatic shutter mechanism including a pair of reciprocable shutter blades 18 and 20 pivotally connected to opposite ends of a walking beam 22 which, in turn, is pivotal about a central axis 24. The walking beam is connected to one side of the pivotal axis 24 to a solenoid 26. A tension spring 28 is connected to the walking beam 22 on the opposite side of the pivot axis 24. The shutter blade 18 and 20 are respectively provided with tear shaped exposure apertures 30 and 32 which are moved by reciprocable motion of the blades 18 and 20 from a relative position of complete nonalignment in a closed shutter condition to varying degrees of alignment over the taking axis 15 in an open shutter condition.From the organization of the shutter blades 18 and 20, the walking beam 22, the solenoid 26 and the spring 28, it will be appreciated that when energized the solenoid 26 pulls the blades 18 and 20 to a closed shutter condition. When released, the tension spring pivots the walking beam 22 to reciprocate the blades 18 and 29 to an open shutter condition.During opening movement of the shutter blades 18 and 20, light is also passed through a pair of auxiliary apertures 34 and 36 in the shutter blades to a light responsive transducer 38. The transducer 38 is incorporated in electronic circuitry of the camera as disclosed, for example, in the aforementioned U.S.Patent No. 3,200,723.Fig. 1 suffices for an appreciation of operating principles relevant to the present invention. The shutter blades 18 and 20 are initially retained in their closed position against the bias of the tension spring 28 by a latch 40 connected with an actuating button 42 in turn connection to an normally open switch S1 which by its closure initiates an exposure cycle. Upon movement of the latch 40 by such depression of the button 42, the blades move toward an open position under the biasing force of the tension spring 28. Upon the occurence of such movement, a normally closed switch S2 is opened by movement of the blade 20, for example.Closure of the switch S1 enables a trigger circuit 44 and opening of the switch S2 initiates operation of a light integrating circuit 46 such that when the amount of light passed to the cell 38 corresponds to the amount of light needed for proper exposure of the film 16, a shutter closing signal at the trigger circuit 44 energizes the solenoid 26 to initiate closing movement of the shutter blades 18 and 20 and to return t.he blades to a closed shutter condition to terminate the exposure.The aforementioned exposure cycle is representative of an ambient light mode of operation in which the subject matter to be photographed is illuminated by daylight or a comparable constant source of illumination. The amount of light to which the film 16 is exposed is primarily dependent on the length of time the shutter blades remain in an open condition and on the shape of the apertures 30 and 32 which determine the size of opening defined over the taking axis 15. If the solenoid 26 is energized before the blades 18 and 20 have moved to their fullest extent due to high ambient illumination, for example the opening defined by the oppositely oriented tear shaped apertures is smaller than where the blades 18 and 20 are moved completely to a full open position where the base or bulbous portions of the apertures 30 and 32 come into registration with each other.In any event, movement of the shutter blades 18 and 20 from a closed condition to an open condition and back to a closed condition is governed by scene light passing through the secondary apertures 34 and 36 to the cell 38, and the response of the system to such light which, given the current state of the art, may be considered instantaneous. Although movement of the shutter blades and other mechanical components of the shutter system is relatively noninstantaneous, the system may be calibrated to account for the actual time interval incurred in such movement without difficulty at least under ambient lighting conditions. The light integration operation is modified in a conventional manner for ambient and flash exposures, the mode of operation being automatically selected in response to insertion or removal of the flash 51.Furthermore, while the ambient mode arrangement utilizes the described scanning shutter it is otherwise of little import herein since, as later explained with regard to the flash mode, the flash operates at full aperture.Since the length of time during which the shutter mechanism remains in an open condition is predicated solely on the amount of light seen by the cell 38, it is preferred that the maximum length of time of the open shutter condition is restricted. Also the specific time of exposure may vary substantially with varying focal lengths of the lens 10, for example, and the use for which the camera is intended, a minimum shutter speed of 1 50 second or 20 milliseconds is assumed reasonable for a hand held camera.Slower shutter speeds are presumed likely to cause a loss of resolution or blurring in the resulting photograph. On the other hand, shutter speed sufficiently slow to cause such blurring can result in the avoidance of underexposure in conditions where subnormal ambient lighting is incurred or with excessive camers Subject distances in a flash mode of film exposure. Automatic shutter systems used with amateur cameras typically employ an override limiting the maximum time of an open shutter condition to an interval on the order of 1 20th of a second or 50 milliseconds.Thus, in the present arrangement the maximum time of a shutter is permitted to remain in an open condition under the control of the light integrating circuit 46 is limited to 50 milliseconds by a time out circuit 48 shown in Fig. 1 which is connected with the trigger circuit 44 of the light integrated circuit 46 through an OR gate 50. The time out circuit overrides the light integrating circuit to provide a minimum shutter speed or a maximum time during which the shutter blades 18 and 20 are permitted to remain in an open condition. To facilitate a flash illumination mode of operation, a flash synchronization circuit 49 is provided to be actuated by opening movement of the switch S2. The synchronizing circuit 49 and switchS2 are conventional mechanisms arranged to fire the flash 51 when the blades reach a full open condition.Thus, except when a flash exposure is attempted under high ambient conditions which precludes the system from reaching its fully open condition all flash exposures are made at the full open or maximum aperture. Consequently, while the varying apertures produced by the scanning shutter are available for ambient exposures, the camera is essentially a fixed aperture camera for flash and the burden of flash control with subject distance or flash tracking then solely rests on the shutter closing.Thus, film exposure by flash illumination in the system of the present invention is governed by the fixed maximum aperture 14, or its equivalent by registration of the shutter blade apertures 30 and 32 in a fully open condition. Hence, the flash contribution to the exposure is determined by the quantity of flash illumination reflected from the subject through the aperture 14 to the film 16 during the time interval between firing the flash bulb 51 and complete closure of the shutter blades.A single flash bulb 51 is shown, but it is preferable that the latter be provided in an array for firing in order with each successive exposure.The quantity of light emitted by the flash bulb 51, or the total light energy thereof, is a predictable value and determined by the design of the bulb.Flash illumination reflected from a subject to the photographed, however, varies in intensity primarily with the distance between the flash lamp and the subject or with camera subject distance.Another incident of flash illumination which is relevant is that the amount of light available for exposure of the film strip 16 is predicated on the rapidly varying intensity of the flash illumination over a relatively short period of time. As a result, the response capabilities of the shutter system become more critical with flash illumination generally than with ambient light. In particular, the amount of flash light transmitted by the shutter apertures 30 and 32 after the generation of a shutter closing signal by the trigger circuit 44 during movement of the blades 18 and 20 to a fully closed condition must be accounted for to achieve proper exposure of the film strip 16 with flash illumination. To this end an anticipation circuit 52 is activated to advance the instant of the shutter closing signal in the exposure time interval.An embodiment of the anticipation circuitry adapted to the present system is shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2, the light integrating circuit 46 and the anticipation circuit 52 are enclosed by separate dashed line rectangles.The photoresponsive transducer 38 is connected across the input terminals of a differential type operational amplifier 53. The anticipation circuit 52 is in the nature of a feedback circuit between one of the inputs of the amplifier 53 and the output 55 of the amplifier. The result of this arrangement is that the transducer 38 operates in a constant current mode of operation under conditions of non varying scene light intensity to provide a substantially linear output response at the amplifier output 55. The output terminal 55 of the amlifier is connected to a level detector 57, the output 59 of which is in turn connected to the trigger circuit 44 through the OR gate 50 as described above.The anticipation factor of the circuit 52 is provided by serially connecting a resistive element 61 with a capacitive element 63. The output integration signal response at the output terminal 55 for this arrangement is represented in Fig. 3.The dashed line 54 represents the rate of light integrating circuit output or voltage against time for a given ambient lighting condition. When the light integral reaches a trigger voltage, the shutter closing signal is developed and the solenoid 26 is energized. The solid line 56 represents operation with the anticipation circuit 52. Specifically, the time interval required for the light integral to reach trigger voltage is advanced to compensate for the flash illumination passing the apertures 30 and 32 during movement of the blades 18 and 20 to a close shutter condition. The RC time constant for the capacitor 63 and the resistor 61 determines the break point for the curve 56 or the instant at which the slope of the curve 56 equals the slope of the curve 54. Varying the value of the resistor 61 causes a corresponding variation in the anticipation time, represented in Fig. 3 by the length of a horizontal line between the curve 56 and 54. In particular, an increase in the value of the resistor 61 will increase the anticipation time. Also, a change in the value of the resistor 61 will effect a corresponding change in the RC time constant which effects the break point of the curve 56. A capacitor 65 connected in parallel relation with respect to the serially connected resistor 61 and capacitor 63 functions to filter or dampen the output response of the circuit 52 during the initial charge up time of the capacitor 63 in order to prevent transient oscillations which can occur under certain conditions. Thus, the capacitor 65 provides a smooth transition from the initiation of scene light detection and integration to the break point where output integration signal approaches the desired slope. The slope of the linear portion of the scene light integration curve 56 is determined by the combined values of the capacitors 63 and 65, and because of the parallel connection of these capacitors, equals the summation of the values of the capacitors 63 und 65 in Fig. 2. Tracking error or variation in film exposure due to different camera subject distance i.e., overexposure with close ups and underexposure with distant subjects in a camera system of the type represented in Fig. 1 is the result of an inability of the shutter system to adequately control the reflected flash illumination passing to the film strip. With relatively slow speed or less sensitive films where the amount of illumination needed for proper exposure is relatively large, tracking error can be reduced to an acceptable degree as a result of the anticipation circuit 52 alone. This capability is believed due in part to the time of shutter closing movement being small in relation to the total amount of light needed for proper exposure of the film.With high speed films, however, and a flash bulb designed to provide the proper amount of light for a design, or medial camera subject distance, any variation in the time duration of shutter closing movement is a more substantial portion of the total film exposure time.Such variation is, moreover, a time increment with finite minimal limits given the current state of the art relative to shutter mechanism.In Fig. 4 of the drawings, the illumination characteristics of a flash bulb designed using conventional criteria for the exposure of high speed film in a camera system represented by Fig. 1, is illustrated in graphic form. In particular, the burn characteristics of such flash bulb exhibit a rapid increase in light intensity as depicted by the line 58 followed by a substantially rapid rate of intensity decay along the line 60. Thus, the total amount of illuminating energy is represented by the area of an essentially isosceles triangle defined by the abscissa and the lines 58 and 60. While the prior art flash envelope is shown for convenience as essentially an isosceles triangle, it is understood that the rise and fall of such flash illumination are not straight lines or equal however, such deviation is of no import herein.Burn time is conventionally defined as the interval of time during which light intensity is above an intensity value I 2 which is one half the maximum intensity I achieved by the bulb. The definition of burn time is selected also because it represents a parameter which is the equivalent of shutter speed under ambient light exposure conditions. In other words, the burn time exemplified in Fig. 3 by using conventional design criteria for a given high speed film is in the order or 10 milliseconds or the equivalent shutter speed of 1 100th of a second.In Fig. 4, the shaded areas 62, 64 and 66 represent the quantity of light passed to the film strip 16 during movement of the shutter blades 18 and 20 to a closed condition at varying camera subject distances. Assuming a given ambient light level, at a close subject distance, the reflected flash illumination will be high such that the close command will produce an early shutter closing during which the exposure illumination represented by the area 63 will occur. For a medial camera subject distance, the close command will occur at a later time, and filash illumination reaching the film during this closing is represented by the area 64. Finally, the area 66 is representative of a more distant camera subject distance.Because of the rapid rate of intensity build up and decay, it will be seen that the areas 63, 64 and 66 represent substantial differences of exposure illumination. These differences, coupled with their proportion of the total exposure illumination, make it difficult to sufficiently reduce tracking error.In Fig. 5, the characteristic light intensity time curve is shown for a combustible filament flash bulb having the same total illumination capacity as that represented in Fig. 4, but with the flash bulb, represented by Fig. 5, modified in accordance with the present invention. To lengthen the burn time to approximately 20 milliseconds 1 50 of a second , or to the longest interval of exposure reasonably compatible with hand held operation.Increasing the burn time to this interval results in a reduction of the maximum intensity Is while retaining the same overall illumination inasmuch as the area under the curve 68 in Fig. 5 remains the same as the area under the lines 58 and 60 in Fig. 4 since the flash bulbs represented have the same total illumination capacity or energy. In Fig. 5, the area 72, 74 and 76 again represent the quantity of light passes to the film during closing under relatively close, medial and remote camera subject distances in the same manner as the area 62, 64 and 66 in Fig. 5.The curves shown in Fig. 5 are reasonably accurate reproductions of the illumination curves exhibited by actual practice of the invention. In particular, the solid line curve 68 in Fig. 5 is a plot of illumination intensity expressed on the ordinate axis as units of zonal lumens and on the abscissa axis in milliseconds. The dashed line curve 70 inFig. 5 is a result of plotting units of zonal lumen seconds or power against time. The term zonal lumes is the light intensity in a cone of dispersion diverging at an angle of approximately 40C and thus the intensity of light projected to subject matter seen by the film 16 during exposure.From Fig. 5 it will be appreciated, therefore, that the maximum intensity of flash illumination is approximately 12,500 zonal lumes and this point in the curve is reached at approximately 25 milliseconds after the flash is fired. The maximum power of the bulb in zonal lumen seconds is reached at the expiration of flash illumination and is approximately 325 zonal lumen seconds. It will be noted further in Fig. 5 that the burn time extends from approximately 15 milliseconds to slightly in excess of 35 milliseconds. The actual burn time of the flash lamp represented by the solid line curve 68 in Fig. 5, therefore, is slightly in excess of 20 milliseconds.It has been found that burn times of up to approximately 24 milliseconds can be used without appreciable blurring or loss of resolution due to camera movement.As a result of the longer burn time and reduced maximum intensity, however, two important advantages are obtained by the flash bulb of Fig. 5 as compared with the flash bulb represented by Fig. 4 namely, 1 for a given ambient light level, the length of time the shutter mechanism remains in an open condition in the flash mode is increased so that light passing the shutter during movement of the blades 18 and 20 to a closed condition is substantially reduced in proportion to the total light needed for proper exposure of the film strips 16, and 2 the effect of variation in shutter closing speed is reduced since the variation in the amount of light passing the shutter during such closing movement, represented by the areas 72, 74 and 76 inFig. 5, will be reduced. Use of the flash bulb modification represented byFig. 5 has demonstrated surprising results in practice. With a conventional flash bulb represented by Fig. 4 supplied under specification to have a total illuminating energy approximately 325 zonal lumen seconds adequate to expose a high speed film ASA 600 in a lowcost camera of the type represented by Fig. 1 and having a fixed flash aperture the maximum camera aperture of F 19, photographs taken at a camera subject distance of about 2,50 m were underexposed by approximately 3 4 of a stop and overexposed at about 1 m by about 1 2 stop for a total tracking error of 1 1 4 stops.By increasing the effect of the anticipation circuit 52 specifically by increasing the resistance 61 of this circuit in relation to the capacitors 63 and 65 hereof tracking error in photographs taken at the same camera subject distance was reduced to about 3 5 of a stop. Further attempts at increasing the effect of the anticipation circuit resultet in little if any decrease of the tracking error. Photographs taken at the same fixed aperture and same camera subject distances using the maximized anticipation circuit and the vaporizable filament flash bulb represented by Fig. 5 one having a burn time of 20 milliseconds resulted in a reduction of tracking error to zero. In other words, there was no discernible difference in exposure of photographs taken at three feet and at eight feet using the flash bulb of Fig. 5 having a 20 millisecond burn time. In light of the foregoing, the present invention results in a substantially improved photographic system by which a tracking error resulting from flash illumination in simple low cost cameras may be substantially eliminated.
