# Adder for exponent arithmetic.

## Abstract
A characteristic adder for use in a data processing system that peforms floating point arithmetic operations is a 1 s complement subtractive adder 200, 222, 220 which forms the sum or difference of a pair of operand characteristics under control of function control circuitry 240 , along with a signal indicating which char acteristic is the larger of the two. The indicating signal is used to select which operand mantissa should be shifted for proper alignment. The function control circui try 240 responds to function signals to select addition or subtraction, provide the magnitude or complement of the results, and select between two available floating point formats. Characteristic Overflow and Underflow is tested and signaled for each of the two possible floating point formats.
