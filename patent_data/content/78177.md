# Semiconductor light emitting device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor light emitting device, of the double hetero structure laser type, includes an active layer 24 between first and second clad layers 23, 25 , the first clad layer 23 being of n type conductivitv and the second clad layer 25 being of p type conductivity. The device further includes a buffer layer 29 of p type conductivity sand wiched between the active layer 24 and the first clad layer 23 , the band gap of the buffer layer being wider than that of the active layer but narrower than that of the first clad layer, and the thickness of the buffer layer being no greater than the diffusion length of electrons injected into that layer during normal operation of the device. Such a buffer layer can improve temperature stability of the lasing threshold.
