# A dental floss performing a disinfecting action and or a preventive action against bacterial plaques and or caries.

## Abstract
A dental floss, which is normally used in dentistry only for a mechanical cleaning of the spaces between the teeth, is given a disinfecting and therapeutic prophylactic property with a specific disinfecting and preventive action against bacterial plaques and caries obtained by forming a film of a substance containing the suitable agents on the surface of the dental floss, these agents being preferably one or more of the follow ing active principles each having the above mentioned proper ties quaternary ammonium bases performing a disinfecting action chloroexidine digluconate performing a preventive action against bacterial plaques sodium mono fluorophosphate performing a preventive ac tion against caries this is preferably otbained by locating the reel 10 of dental floss 11 within a case in the open upper part 22 of which a closed chamber 14 is received containing a mass of a gel in cluding the above agents the closed chamber has an opening 19, 20 both in the top and bottom walls 16, 18 through which the dental floss 11 passes through the chamber 14 and the gel mass that, consequently, forms the film on the den tal floss 10 as the same is unwound from reel 10 .

## Description
A DENTAL FLOSS PERFORMING A DISINFECTING ACTION AND ORA PREVENTIVE ACTION AGAINST BACTERIAL PLAQUES AND ORCARIESThis invention relates to a dental floss of the type normally used in dentistry only for a mechanical cleaning action of the spaces between the teeth, which is also given a disinfecting and therapeutic prophylatic property with a specific disinfecting and preventive action against bacterial plaques and caries. This is obtained by forming a film of a substance containing one or more active principles, each having the above mentioned property, in any suitable way, on the dental floss surface.The principles can be a quaternary ammonium bases for the disinfecting action b chloroe xi dine digluconate for the preventive action against bacterial plaques c sodium mono fluorophosphate or other fluorine compounds for the preventive action against caries. At present, trimethylcetyl ammonium para toluenesulfonate is the quaternary ammonium base preferred as an antiseptic product. According to the invention, the film of active substance can be formed either during the manufacture of the dental floss or by placing a reel thereof dipped into a gel containing the active principles within a case, or preferably, upon using the dental floss as it is drawn out of its case.In other words, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention the untreated dental floss.is received within a case in the upper portion of which there is placed a mass of a gel containing the above mentioned active principles. This gel mass is received within a chamber suitably fitted into the opening of the case containing the dental floss rei. Suitable openings are formed both on the chamfer bottom, which separates the chamber from the space containing the dental floss and in the chamber upper wall which separates the chamber from the atmosphere. The dental los end t be unwound is passed throughthe opening on the chamber bottom, the gel mass and the opening In the chamber upper wall. The dental floss is then drawn out of the case, the end of which is closed by a suitable screw cap outside the chamber upper wall. It should be noted that the two openings are preferably offset on opposite sides with respect to the chamber axis. Accordingly, the dental floss path within the gel longer to help tha formatio of the gl ilm on the dental floss surface. The gel composition preferred at present is as follows carboxymethylcellulose 1 glycerol 50 micronized silica 5 sorbitol 10 xylitol 10 water as necessary. Furthermore, the percentages in weight of the above mentioned active principles relative to the gel are preferably comprised within the following ranges trimethylcetyl ammonium para toluenesulfonate 0,050 chloroexidine digluconate 0,020 0,1 sodium mono fluorophosphate 0,05 0,15 The invention will be now described in detail with reference to the annexed drawing which is an exploded sectional view showing a case according to a presently preferred embodiment of the invention. With reference to the drawing, in a presently preferred embodiment of the invention reel 10 of dental floss 11 is received within cavity 12 of a cylindrical case 13. A closed cylindrical chamber referred to by numeral 14 is fitted into the upper portion of case 13. Chamber 14 comprises a side wall 15, a bottom 16 and an upper wall 18. A small slot 19 is formed on bottom 16, which slot 19 is offset with respect to the chamber axis, and a small hole 20 is formed in upper wall 18. Hole 20 is offset relative to opening 19, thus being placed on the opposite side of the chamber axis. The upper opening of case 13 which receives chamber 14 is closed by a screw cap referred to by 21. Cap 21 is threadingly engaged with the corre spondingly threaded end 22 of case 13 and is provided with at least one hole referred to by numeral 23 through which dental floss ll can be drawn out of case 13. Chamber 14 receives the gel containing the active principles according to the invention, the preferred composition of which will be described below. As it will be evident frn om the foregoing,the length of dental floss.11 which is unwound from reel 10 is first passed through slot 19 and then through hole 20 thus having an oblique path through t,e gcl cotaiiiing chamber 14. Accordingly, as the dental floss is drawn out of the upper portion of cap 21 to be used it is covered with a film of the gel contained within chamber 14 through which the dental floss passes. In all the possible embodiments of the invetion the composition of the gel to be associated with the dental floss in order to allow the dental loss to perform the above mentioned therapeutic and prophylactic action besides the mechanical action thereof, is as follows carboxymethylcellulose glycerol 50 micronized silica 5 sorbitol 10 ylitol 10 trimethyl c etyl ammonium para toluenesulfonate 0,1, chloroexidine digluconate 0,0025 sodium mono fluorophosphate 0,1 water as necessary. It should be understood that the invention is not limited either to the foregoing or to the abovementioned substances and percentages thereof, the invention comprising, however, a dental floss associated with one or more substances carried thereby to support and complete the simply mechanical action performed by the dental floss between the teeth owing to their antiseptic and preventive action against bacterial plaques and caries. The above mentioned quaternary ammonium base, for example, can be replaced by cetylpyridinium chloride which performs a similar antiseptic action chloroexidine digluconate can be replaced by benzalkonium chloride which has a similar preventive action against bacterial plaques and the like.
