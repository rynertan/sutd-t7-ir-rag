## Description
The present invention relates to a laser printer optical system, of the kind referred to in the pre characterizing portion of patent claim 1. Such a laser printer optical system is known from DE A 31 02 185. In many of laser beam printers which include a laser diode to utilize the electrophotographic method, a photoconductive surface of a drum is scanned by and exposed to laser light emitted from the laser diode to form an electrostatic latent image in the photoconductive surface, and then a toner image obtained by developing the latent image of electric charge is transferred to ordinary recording paper to fix the transferred toner image, thereby recording a desired image on the recording paper. In the case where the laser diode is used as a light source, laser light is modulated by a video signal for forming a picture image, in such a manner that a laser diode driving current is fed or cut in accordance with the video signal, that is, the laser light is intermittently generated. The scanning exposure of the photoconductive surface of the drum is carried out in the following manner. The photoconductive surface of the drum is repeatedly scanned with a laser light spot in a direction parallel to the rotating axis of the drum by deflecting the laser light by means of a rotating mirror or vibrating mirror, while rotating the drum at a constant speed. In order to synchronize the scanning exposure with the modulation of the laser light, the laser light is deflected to the outside of a picture image area on the photoconductive surface of the drum, and the deflected light impinges upon a photoelectric conversion element which is disposed on the outside of the above mentioned area for the purpose of position detection. Thus, a deflecting position can be detected. The photoelectric transducer for position detection is generally disposed on the side of the starting point of a scanning line, and the laser light is modulated in accordance with the time elapsed after the laser light spot has left the photoelectric transducer. Further, in order to cause the laser light emitted from the laser diode to form the laser light spot having a predetermined shape on the photoconductive surface of the drum, to prevent the laser light spot from deviating from the scanning position, or to prevent a deflecting angle of the laser light formed by a deflecting mirror from being too large, various lenses and mirrors are arranged on a laser light path. In such laser beam printers, the intensity of laser light incident upon the photoconductive surface of the drum is required to be kept on a predetermined constant level, in order to obtain a picture image of high quality. Since the luminous intensity of a laser diode varies with temperature, it has been proposed to provide in the laser beam printers thermostatic means for maintaining the laser diode at a constant temperature. However, the luminous efficiency of the laser diode also decreases due to the fatique or degradation thereof. Further, in the laser beam printers, laser light incident upon the photoconductive surface of the drum is attenuated by stains on the lenses and mirrors, and therefore the intensity of the laser light incident upon the photoconductive surface varies even when the laser diode is kept at a constant temperature. From DE A1 31 02 185 a laser printer optical system including a light receiving drum and a light source is known, which is provided with a control circuit for controlling a current supplied to a laser diode emitting a beam which is scanned into the drum, said control circuit comprising a photoelectric transducer for converting the intensity of laser light emitted from said laser diode into an analog detection signal a comparator for comparing said analog detection signal with a reference electrical signal to deliver a binary signal a digital up down counter applied with said binary signal to change over from one of an up count mode and a down count mode to the other a digital to analog converter for converting a digital output signal from said digital up down counter into an analog output signal and a current control circuit for controlling a current flowing through said laser diode, in accordance with said analog output signal. It is the object of the present invention to improve a laser printer optical system of the kind referred to above such that a continuous stable image recording is achieved. According to the present invention the above object is attained, with a laser printer optical system as claimed. Dependent claims are directed to features of preferred embodiments of the invention. The present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing the whole construction of an embodiment of a laser printer optical system according to the present invention and Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing in detail a portion of the embodiment shown in Fig. 1. The intensity of laser light emitted from a laser diode varies with a current flowing through the laser diode. According to a feedback control method used in a general constant output control technique, an output from output means is detected to be compared with a reference value, and an input to the output means is corrected on the basis of a difference between the output and reference value. In the previously mentioned laser beam printers, however, laser light is intermittently generated due to intensity modulation and deflected so as to scan a predetermined area. Accordingly, it is required to detect the intensity of the laser light in a short time by a photoelectric detector, and to hold the detected value till the next detecting time. That is, it is necessary to provide, in the laser beam printers, an analog memory circuit for sampling holding an analog detection signal delivered from a photoelectric transducer for light intensity detection and a digital memory circuit for storing therein a digital signal obtained by subjecting the analog detection signal to analog to digital conversion. In this case, the time in which the intensity of laser light is detected, is very short. Accordingly, the analog memory dircuit and digital memory circuit are required to be rapid in response, and therefore they are expensive. Further, in the case where the analog detection signal indicating a photoelectric conversion value of laser light is not obtained, or in the case where the moment the analog detection signal is generated, is not synchronized with the moment the analog detection signal is sampled, the value to be stored in each of the memories becomes zero, and therefore the difference between the detected value and a reference value becomes large. When the current flowing through the laser diode is corrected on the basis of such a large difference, an excessive current flows through the laser diode, and thus the life thereof is shortened. On the other hand, according to the feed back control used in the present invention, it is judged by a comparator only whether the analog detection signal indicating a photoelectric conversion value of laser light is greater than a reference value or not, that is, the difference value between the analog detection signal and reference value is not taken into consideration, and a digital up down counter counts a clock signal which is applied to the counter when a binary signal such as a high or low level signal which is delivered from the comparator. Accordingly, the present invention can employ circuit elements which are inexpensive and rapid in response. Further, even when the difference between the analog detection signal and reference value is large, a large correction current does not flow through the laser diode, and therefore the life thereof is not shortened. In other words, an abrupt, great change is not caused in the luminous intensity of the laser diode when the laser diode is ordinarily used, and therefore the number of clock pulses which are supplied to the up down counter when the binary signal is delivered from the comparator, can be made small for example, made equal to one . Fig. 1 shows, in a block diagram, a control circuit included in an embodiment of the present invention. A current flowing through a laser diode 1 is controlled by a current control circuit 2. The circuit 2 includes transistors 3 and 4 making up a differential switch, and a constant current source 5. The emitters of the transistors 3 and 4 are connected to a constant current source 5 in common. The collector of the transistor 3 is connected to a power line through a resistor 6, and the collector of the transistor 4 is connected to the power line through a parallel combination of the laser diode 1, a reverse voltage protecting diode 7 and a resistor 8. Resistors 9 and 10 are used for applying a bias voltage to the transistor 3, and resistors 11 and 12 are used for applying a bias voltage to the transistor 4. A photodiode 13 for photoelectric conversion is placed at a scanning position of deflected laser light, and delivers an analog detection signal corresponding to the intensity of laser light emitted from the laser diode 1. It is judged by a comparator 16 whether the analog detection signal delivered from the photodiode 13 is greater than a reference electrical signal determined by voltage dividing resistors 14 and 15 or not. A binary signal delivered from the comparator 16 takes a high level when the analog detection signal is smaller than the reference electrical signal, and takes a low level when the analog detection signal is greater than the reference electrical signal. A digital up down counter hereinafter referred to as a U D counter 17 takes an up count mode or a down count mode according as the binary signal applied to a count mode control terminal U D takes the high or low level, to count a sampling clock signal which is supplied from a signal generator 18 to a clock terminal CK. A digital output signal delivered from the U D counter 17 is converted into an analog output signal by a digital to analog converter hereinafter referred to as a D A converter 19. The constant current source 5 is controlled by the analog output signal, and thus a constant current is set in accordance with the analog output signal. A video signal delivered from the signal generator 18 is applied to the base of the transistor 3. Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing in detail a circuit portion including the U D counter 17 and D A converter 19. The U D counter 17 includes 4 bit U D counters 17a and 17b to form an 8 bit U D counter. An 8 bit digital output signal from the U D counter 17 is applied to input terminals of each of the 8 bit D A converter 19 and an 8 input NAND gate 17c. Count mode control terminals hereinafter referred to as U D terminals Now, explanation will be made on the circuit operation in the above mentioned circuit configuration. When the power switch is turned on, a load pulse is supplied from the initializing circuit to the load input terminals In the case where the intensity of laser light incident upon the photodiode 13 is decreased due to the fatigue or degradation of the laser diode 1 or a stain in an optical system, the current control operation is performed in the state that the contents of the U D counters 17a and 17b have been increased by the above mentioned one LSB. The operating point of the U D counters 17a and 17b becomes higher as the fatigue or degradation of the laser diode 1 proceeds or the stain in the optical system becomes large. Finally, the digital output signal takes a value FF namely, a maximum value of the contents of the U D counters 17a and 17b . The circuit characteristic of the above mentioned circuit configuration is previously set so that the digital output signal takes the value FF at the same time as the current for driving the laser diode 1 takes a maximum permissible value. When the digital output signal takes the value FF , all input terminals of the 8 input NAND gate 17c are kept at a high level, and the output signal of the gate 17c takes a low level. Accordingly, the 2 input AND gate 17d takes a low level, and the U D counters 17a and 17b take the down count mode. When the next sampling signal is supplied to the U D counters 17a and 17b, the digital output signal from the U D counters takes a value FE namely, a value next to the previously mentioned maximum value FF . Thus, the output signal of the 8 input NAND gate 17c again takes the high level, to cause the U D counters 17a and 17b to take the up count mode. As mentioned above, the current control operation is performed in a range defined by the values FF and FE , in order to prevent the current for driving the laser diode 1 from exceeding the maximum permissible value. On the other hand, when the current for driving the laser diode 1 takes the maximum permissible value, the flip flop circuit 17h is triggered by the low level signal from the NAND gate 17c to generate the maintenance signal, which operates the indicator 20. Thus, an operator is informed of the necessity of a maintenance operation. In laser beam printers, the generation of laser light is modulated by a video signal sent out from the signal generator 18, to form a picture image. When the video signal takes a high level, the transistor 3 is turned on and the transistor 4 is turned off. Accordingly, the laser diode 1 does not emit laser light or emits a weak laser beam substantially incapable of producing an exposure effect on the photoconductive surface of the drum . When the video signal takes a low level, the transistor 3 is turned off and the transistor 4 is turned on. Thus, the laser diode is operated at a current set by the above mentioned current control operation, and thus emits laser light having a predetermined intensity. As can be seen from the foregoing description, the present embodiment has the following advantages. As has been explained in the foregoing, according to the present invention, there is provided a laser printer optical system in which the intensity of laser light on a predetermined laser light path is kept constant.
