# Integrated combined dynamic RAM and ROS.

## Abstract
A combined read only storage ROS and read write random access memory RAM integrated circuit memory cell is disclosed. In a first cell embodiment, a ROS FET device ROS₁ and a RAM FET device RAM₁ are connected in common to a bit sensing line BL2 connected to a sense amplifier which senses if the ROS FET device has discharged the bit sensing line BL2 indicating that a gate is present on the ROS FET device. A write driver circuit 32 is also connected to the bit sensing line BL2 , for providing current through the RAM FET device to the charge storage element for writing a one or a zero therein. In a second cell embodiment, a combined two bit read only storage and one bit read write random access memory integrated circuit cell is disclosed. The bit sensing line is shared by two ROS FET devices and one RAM FET device. In a third cell embodiment of the invention, a single binary bit is stored for read only storage and a single binary bit is stored for read write random access memory storage. The charge storage element shares a common node with the ROS FET device and the RAM FET device and the sense amplifier is connected to the opposite side of the RAM FET device.
