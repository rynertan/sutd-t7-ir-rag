# Process for the preparation of 3 bromosubstituted deacetoxycephalosporanic acid sulphoxide derivatives.

## Abstract
3 Bromo substituted deacetoxycephalosporanic acid sulphoxide derivatives are prepared by silylating the carboxy group in order to protect same of a 3 unsubstituted deacetoxycephalosporanic acid sulphoxide derivative in an inert anhydrous organic solvent, and then brominating the resulting silyl ester of the deacetoxycephalosporanic acid sulphoxide in situ.
