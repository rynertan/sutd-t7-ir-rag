# A THERMODYNAMIC ROTARY ENGINE

## Abstract
A thermodynamic rotary engine 2 comprising a posi tive displacement compressor 4 , a combustion chamber 6 in which air from the compressor and fuel are burnt, and a rotatable cyclicly operating gas expander 10 , the gas expander comprising a rotor 12 which is constructed for rotation within a cylinder 16 , the cylinder being rotatable with the rotor in the same direction as the rotor, the cylinder and the rotor defining between them a variable volume expansion chamber 10 as they rotate during operation of the engine, the cylinder having a fixed inwardly projecting vane 22 which slidably engages in sealing means 24 in the rotor and so divides the variable volume expansion chamber into two portions, the sealing means being rotatable in the rotor so that the vane can remain engaged between the rotor and the cylinder inspite of differential rotational speeds between the rotor and the cylinder during each cycle of operation of the gas expander, and the gas expander having inlet port means 28, 30 and outlet port means 32 .
