# Treating aluminium with chlorine.

## Abstract
When molten aluminium is treated with chlorine to remove alkali and alkaline earth metals and hydrogen, there is formed a brittle oxide crust which does not protect the metal from oxidation. This problem is solved by admixing with the chlorine a minor proportion of a gaseous compound of fluorine, preferably sulphur hexafluoride, which can form alkali or alkaline earth metal fluorides in the presence of molten aluminium. The proportion of sulphur hexafluoride to chlorine gas is preferably from 0.01 to 1.0. Ingots cast using the treated metal are free of oxide patches on their surface.
