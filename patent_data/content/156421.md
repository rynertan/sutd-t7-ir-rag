# Process for preparing cyanamide.

## Abstract
An improved process for the preparation of cyanamide or a cyanamide containing gas mixture by passing urea and or urea decomposition products over a catalyst at a temper ature in the range of between about 200 C and 600 C. A po rous catalyst is utilized which has an intracrystalline pore diameter of at most 8 Ã…, whereby a high conversion to cy anamide is obtained and the formation of melamine by prod ucts is substantially reduced.
