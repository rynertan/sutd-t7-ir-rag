## Description
Photosensitive Lithographic Printing Plate The present invention relates to a photosensitive lithographic printing plate, and more particularly to a photosensitive lithographic printing plate having extremely high sensitivity so that a printing image can be formed by the laser plate making process and the thus formed image can be developed by a weakly alkaline aqueous solution. In the field of lithographic printing, so called PS plates, i.e. presensitized plates prepared by using diazo type photosensitive materials, have been widely used.However, the conventional presensitized plates are low in photosensitivity and sensible mainly by the near ultraviolet light rays. It has been proposed recently that the process efficiency can be greatly improved by exposing a green or immaculate printing plate with laser or other focused light directly without any intermediate masking by a high speed scanning controlled by a computer. However, this conspicuous proposal has not yet been used practically for the attendant problems that scanning exposure of the conventional photosensitive lithographic plate requires large output ultaviolet laser. leading to increase in investment for the equipment including a large scale optical system with increase in consumed electrical power in addition to reduction in lifetime of the laser generating system. A primary object of this invention is to provide a photosensitive lithographic printing plate having extremely high sensitivity to a wide wavelength range including the visible light range. Another object of this invention is to provide a photosensitive lithographic printing plate which has extremely high sensitivity particularly to the output lines of visible laser lights and does not show the reciprocity low failure even when exposed to a high illumination light for extremely short time during the high speed scanning exposure process. A further object of this invention is to provide a photosensitive lithographic printing plate which may be easily developed by the use of an ordinary aqueous developing solution to form an image including printing areas on which a printing ink can be coated or spread in a satisfactory condition.

The photosensitive composition may be dissolved in a solvent for dissolving all of the components, such as methyl cellosolve, ethyl cellosolve, methy ethyl ketone, isopropyl alcohol, butyl acetate, toluene, xylene, or butanol to form a uniform solution, which is coated over the supporting substrate through a bar coating, roller coating or spin coating method to form a coating layer having a thickness of from 0.1 to 10 microns followed by drying.

When the thus prepared photosensitive lithographic printing plate of the invention is exposed to light, the photosensitive layer being sensitive to light rays having widely spread wavelengths ranging from the ultraviolet range to the visible light range, the portions irradiated by the light ray are changed to be insoluble to a solvent within an extremely short exposure time so that the printing areas may be left on the supporting substrate by developing with the use of an aquesous weak alkali solution after the selective exposure. Since the photosensitive composition used in the photosensitive lithographic printing plate of the invention has an extremely high sensitivity even to a visible light laser, such as the Ar laser, the printing plate of the invention is adapted to form an image by a high speed scanning exposure with a visible light laser of low output.The thus formed latent image may be easily developed by the use of an ordinary aqueous developing solution, and the printing areas left after the developing step may be well applied with a printing ink to form a clear printed image.
