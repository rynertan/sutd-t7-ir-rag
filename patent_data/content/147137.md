# Preparation of membrane elements for extraction solvent recovery processes.

## Abstract
In fabricating membrane elements, and especially spiral wound membrane elements, for the separation of extraction solvents, especially N methyl 2 pyrrolidone NMP from ex tracted oil fractions e.g., extract of raffinate , adhesive systems consisting of specific silicone elastomers in com bination with specific primers have been identified which are useful in forming the bonds necessary to produce an element, as for example, in forming the edge seal bonds of the membrane that is used to effect the separation, in bonding the membrane leaves to the metal or plastic components of the element, and in forming a protective outer wrap for the element.
