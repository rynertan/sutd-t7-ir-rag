# REACTIVE PLASMA PROCESS FOR ETCHING CHROMIUM FILMS WITH HIGH CHROMIUM OXIDE AND GLASS IMPURITY CONTENT

## Abstract
A thick layer of chromium containing Cr₂O₃ CrO and glass impurities therein is etched in a glow discharge in a low pressure ambient atmosphere of a chlorine containing gas, oxygen and trace amounts of C and F constituents. In a preferred embodiment the C and F constituents are provided by coating the wall of the etching chamber with Teflon and carbon tetrachloride is the chlorine containing gas.
