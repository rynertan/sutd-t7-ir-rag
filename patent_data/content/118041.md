# THE METHOD OF SUPPLYING SOOT FREE PRODUCTS FROM THE PARTIAL OXIDATION OF HYDROCARBON TO THE FUEL STREAM OF THE ACR PROCESS

## Abstract
An energy efficient method for providing a soot free gaseous fuel for an Advanced Cracking Reactor which is produced by partial oxidation of a hydrocarbon fuel to form gaseous products and non gaseous products. The gaseous products are separated from the solid materials with mini mum heat loss and can then be utilized as fuel for the ACR.
