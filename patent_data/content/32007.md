## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TE REGENERATION OF ACID IN THE MANUFACTURE OF REGENERATED CELLULOSE This invention relates to the production of regenerated cellulose by the acidification of an alkaline cellulose solution. In the industrial production of regenerated cellulose, pure cellulose is rcacted with sodium hydroxide, and, in the xanthate process, with carbon disulfide, to produce viscous solution known as viscose, or xanthate.The viscous solution is then reconstituted, either as a transparent film or as a fibre commonly known as rayon by introducing the solution into a bath of an aqueous acid solution. The cellulose, thus regenerated, is passed through the aqueous acid solution to remove residual alkali therefrom, In general, in order to complete this process, it is passed through further acid baths usually two Ã§ur .er acid baths i.e. three in all after which it is washed by a countercurrent of washing water to produce the final product. Because the solution in which the cellulose is regenerated must at all times be kept acid, the overall acid demand of the manufacturing plant is in ecess of that which would theoretically be required to neutralise the alkali used. This results furthermore in the production of washing water effluent which is quite strongly acidic, and which may require treatment before it is possible to discharge it into the sewerage system. This invention provides a method of producing regenerated cellulose comprising regenerating cellulose by acidifying an alkaline cellulose solution, passing the regenerated cellulose through an acid bath to remove residual alkali therefrom, washing the regenerated cellulose with a countercurrent of washing water, passing liquid from the acid bath through the anode compartment of an electrolytic cell, and the washing water through the cathode compartment of the said cell, the said cell being provided with an ion selective membrane cell divider to define the said anode and cathode compartments, and electrolysing the solution in the cell to raise the acidity of the anolyte and lower that of the catholyte ,to produce a less acidic aqueous effluent. In the process of the invention, a viscose solution is acidified, to produce regenerated cellulose.This is generally done by spinning or extruding the solution into aqueous acid. The regenerated cellulose thus produced is passed through the acid solution, and preferably through a number of other acid baths.During passage through the acid baths, acid is carried over by the cellulose, and the successive baths are decreasingly acidic. In the process of the invention it is generally preferable that the acid solution which is passed through the anode compartment of the electrolyte cell is taken from the final or penultimate acid bath, i.e. the ones containing the least strong acid. The electrolysis in this cell is carried out in such a way as to lower the acidity of the acidic effluent i.e. the washing water , so as to make it more nearly neutral, and to increase the acidity of the anolyte, in order to produce more usable acid. The regenerated acid from the anode compartment is preferably recycled to the acid bath, and used as feedstock for the process. The ion selective membrane may be any of the various cation, anion, or bipolar membranes which are commercially available, and which can be used for the electrolysis of water, so as to generate acid and base. Cation selective membranes are generally the most favourable, and such materials generally contain either sulphonic or carboxylic acid groups, attached to a fluorocarbon or hydrocarbon base chain. The electrolysis reaction also produces hydrogen at the cathode, and oxygen at the anode. The hydrogen evolved at the cathode is a useful bonus, as it tends to remove dissolved hydrogen sulphide from the solution, and as a consequence the plant effluent will be reduced in hydrogen sulphide. The oxygen evolved at the anode may be simply allowed to escape to atmosphere, or may be utilised in the plant or elsewhere, for example, in conjunction with an activated sludge bed for further effluent treatment. Similarly, the hydrogen evolved at tie cathode maybe allowed to escape to atmosphere, or may be put to further use, for example as a fuel in a lo pressure burner. Although a simple electrolytic cell may be used in the process of the invention, it is preferable that the cell should be one of a bipolar stack of cells, of alternate anode and cathode compartments, as is well known in the art. The anolyte and catholyte are preferably pumped continuously through the respective compartments, so as t provide rapid movement over the electrodes, and minimise the effect of ion depletion at the electrodes. The cathode material may be any acid resistant conductive material, and we have found that stainless steel is quite suitable. The anode material may be any material suitable for oxygen evolution in acidic solution, for example anodised lead, platinum, irridium, or platinum irridium coated titanium. The cell itself may be constructed of any electrically insulating acid resistant material, for example polyethylene , polypropylene, polyvinylfluoride, or polyester. Suitable apparatus for carrying out the method of the invention comprises a bath for containing an aqueous acid solution, means for introducing an aqueous alkaline cellulose solution into an aqueous acid solution to produce regenerated cellulose in the required form, means for passing the reyenerated cellulose through an aqueous acid solution in the said bath, an acid washing bath for the regenerated cellulose, means for passing the regenerated cellulose through washing water in the washing bath, an electrolytic cell having a cell divider which is an ion selective membrane, and which defines cathode and anode compartments in the cell, means for passing acrid from the acid bath through the anode compartment of the cell, and washing water from the washing bath through the cathode compartment of the cell, and means for supplying a D,C.voltage to the cell to lower the pH of the anolyte and raise that of the catholyte. A particular embodiment of the invention will now be descri bed in detail width reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a conventional production line for regenerated cellulose film, Figure 2 shows a similar production line modified to operate according to the method of the invention, and Figure 3 is a schematic diagram of an electrolytic cell as used in the method of the invention, In the conventional production line shown inFigure 1, an alkaline solution of cellulose viscose is fed from a container 12 to an acid bath 1, wherein it is acidified by aqueous H 2504 5, typically containing approximately 180 gYL H2S04 and 250 g L Na2S04. H2S04 is continuously introduced into the acid bath 1, by the conduit system shown. The regenerated cellulose, in this case in the form of a film 9, passes through the acrid bath 1 over rollers 13, and into a second acid bath 2, over rollers 14, Acid 5 from bath 1 is carried over by the film into bath 2 and from thence to bath 3, and this results in a continuous flow of acrid through the bath. The acid 6 in bath 2 is in communication by conduit 17 width the acrid 7 in bath 3 through which the film 9 passes over rollers 15, after passage through bath 2. baths, 2 and 3 are progressively less acidic, acid solution being carried by the film from bath 1 to bath 2 and thence to bath 3. Typical concentrations for solutions 6 and 7 are 90 g L H2S04 and 210 g L Na2S04. After passage through bath 3, the film passes over rollers 16 through bath 4, which contains mashing water 8. Several such washing baths are normally used, and the film passes through each bath sequentially, in countercurrent fashion to the washing water. Acid is carried over from bath 3 into bath 4 by the moving film, and thus the washing water 8 in bath 4 is more acidic than that in the next bath, and so on down the line. A proportion of the excess acid produced in the neutralisation process is recycled through conduits 18 and 19, and is mixed with the H 2SO4 feedstock. The mixture is filtered and treated in an evaporator, to ensure that the concentration supplied to bath 1 is appropriate.The greater part of the acid from bath 3 is supplied to waste via conduit 20, together with waste washing water from bath 4. In Figure 2, the same plant has been modified to operate in accordance with the invention, by the provision of an electrolytic cell 10, which is shown schematically with its membrane 11 which is a commercially available cation selective membrane nafion . The acid effluent from bath 3 which would otherwise have been allowed to go to waste is passed through the anode compartment of cell 10, from where it is returned to the filter and acid evaporator through conduit 21. Wash water 8 from bath 4 is fed via conduit 22 to the cathode compartment of the electrolytic cell 10. Figure 3 illustrates the overall reaction taking place in the electrolytic cell when a D.C. current is passed between the electrodes. The membrane is relatively impermeable to sulphate ions, and the species mostly responsible for current transfer across the membrane is the sodium ion. Thus sodium ions cross the membrane from anolyte to catholyte, and water discharges at the cathode to give hydrogen gas and OH . This results in a net production in the cathode compartment of sodium hydroxide, which neutralises the H2S04 in the washing water from bath 4, to produce an approximately neutral effluent, containing approximately 60 g L of sodium sulphate. Hydrogen ions produced at the anode stoichiometrically balance the sulphate ions remaining in the anode compartment, to give a net production of sulphuric acid.In order to maintain the potential required at a suitably low level, the sodium ion concentration in the catholyte is preferably maintained not greater than twice that in the anolyte. The cell system shown is particularly appropriate for the cellulose process, as the sulphuric acid produced contains sodium sulphate, which although a disadvantage for other applications is an advantage if the solution is to be used for cellulose production. Good results have been obtained using a cell with a preanodised lead anode, a stainless steel cathode, and a NAFION cation selctive membrane, At a mean cell potential of 60 volts for 19.4 hours with such a cell, a current of 250 amps produced the equivalent of 6 kg ofH2S04 in the anode compartment and 4.92 kg of NaOH in the cathode compartment equivalent to approximately 4,87 kwh.per kg of H2S04 .
