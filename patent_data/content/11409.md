# Production of flexible polyurethane foam.

## Abstract
In the manufacture of flexible polyurethane foam from a polyol having at least two reactive hydrogen atoms as deter mined by the Zerewitinoff method, a polyfunctional isocyan ate and a blowing agent using a polymerization or gel catalyst and a blowing catalyst the blowing agent comprises water and from 10 to 90 of methylene chloride, the polymerization or gel catalyst is chosen from organic and inorganic tin com pounds and preferably certain stannous salts of monocar boxylic acids, and the blowing catalyst comprises a mixture of certain carboxylates of antimony, potassium and zinc. The invention makes possible the preparation of low density polyurethane foams that exhibit a uniform cell struc ture.
