# TOPOLOGICALLY DISTRIBUTED MEMORY MULTIPROCESSOR COMPUTER

## Abstract
A nodular, expandable, topologically distributed memory multiprocessor computer comprises a plurality of non directly communicating slave processors under the control of a synchronizer and a master processor. Memory space is partitioned into a plurality of memory cells. Dynamic variables may be mapped into the memory cells so that they depend upon processing in nearby partitions. Each slave processor is connected in a topologically well defined way through a dynamic bi directional switching system gate way to different respective ones of the memory cells. Access by the slave processors to their respective topologically similar memory cells occurs concurrently or in parallel in such a way that no data flow conflicts occur. The topology of date distribution may be chosen to take advantage of symmetries which occur in broad classes of problems. The system may be tied to a hose computer used for data storage and analysis of data not efficiently processed by the multiprocessor computer.
