# Encoder apparatus for transmitting binary data and transmitting and receiving apparatus.

## Abstract
To enable binary data to be differentialiy encoded into symbols waves for transmission, the data is applied in n bit data words to produce symbols which, when displayed in a phasor diagram are in three groups in three 120 phase sectors respectively, SECTOR 1, SECTOR 2, SECTOR 3 , the number and dispositions of the symbols in the three sectors being the same. The encoding is such that, depending upon the data word to be transmitted the sector in which a symbol is produced is rotated by 0 , 120 or 240 relative to the next preceding sector containing a symbol. In some embodi ments one of the 2
