# TAPPING ATTACHMENT WITH IMPROVED TORQUE RELEASE CLUTCH

## Abstract
A torque release clutch is built into a tapping attach ment. Improvements are embodied in the torque release clutch. Clutch members are provided including a first clutch member and a second clutch member. The main biasing spring acts on the first clutch member. When the clutch parts are disengaged, the first member is moved against the spring and held in an inactive position wherein it is completely out of engagement with the teeth of the other clutch member to eliminate wear. The second clutch mem ber is biased by a relatively light spring to provide just enough engagement between the clutch faces so that upon reversal such faces will re engage.
