# Cementitious cartridge for rock bolting.

## Abstract
A frangible cartridge for anchoring a reinforcing element such as a rock bolt in a borehole in rock strata, for example an underground mine roof, contains as separate components A a hydraulic substance mixed with a non aqueous water miscible liquid which is inert with respect thereto to form a paste like mass and B an aqueous liquid, preferably water, which is capable of reacting with the hydraulic substance in component A on being brought into contact therewith when in use a reinforcing element is caused to break the cartridge and mix together components A and B within the borehole so as to form a cementitious grout around the reinforcing element, said grout serving when hardened to anchor the reinforcing element in the borehole. This cartridge is safer for use in coal mines and the like than the conventional resinous cartridges and is more reliable than cartridges in which the hydraulic substance is present in a dry form.

## Description
CEKENTITIOUS CARTRIDGE FOR ROCK BOtTING This invention relates to the anchoring of a reinforcing element, such as a steel rock bolt or wooden dowel, in a borehole drilled into rock strata, for example the roof of an underground mine, by means of a cementitous grouting system which is introduced into the borehole in the form of a cartridge and is activated in situ by contact with a reinforcing element so as rapidly to form a hardened cementitious grout in the annulus between the reinforcing element and the wall of the borehole, whereby the reinforcing member is firmly anchored in the borehole in as short a time as practicable. For the last ten years or so, the most convenient and technically advantageous method of installing a reinforcing element in a rock borehole has relied upon the use of frangible resios cartridges, one or more of which are inserted into and pushed to the end of the borehole, c llowing which the reinforcing,element is inserted whilst rotating into the borehole so as to break the cartridges and cause the contents thereof to become mixed, thereby forming a resinous grout around the reinforcing element in the borehole which anchors the element in the borehole.Such resinous cartridges are mostly filled with an unsaturated polyester resin system and a hardening i.e.curing agent therefor, the latter being kept separate from the unsaturated resin system, for example by use a two compartment cartridge, until mixed by the action of the reinforcing element. bolts installed with powerful drilling machines, the may not be a serious problem but for the majority of mire bolts and dowels, which are normally more thar 1.5 metres in length and are installed with hand held machines, it poses a major difficulty. It is an object of the present invention to provide a frangible cartridge for use in rock bolting which will avoid the flammability and or toxicity hazards of the polyester based resinous cartridges whilst at the same time avoiding the difficulties and consequent unreliability of the previously proposed cement based cartridges. According to the invention there is provided a cementitious cartridge for anchoring a reinforcing element in a borehole, the cartridge comprising an outer tubular frangible casing having disposed therein in separate compartments A a paste comprising a hydraulic substance and a non aqueous water miscible liquid which is inert with respect to the hydraulic substance and B an aqueous c liquid capable of reacting with the hydraulic substance when brought into contact therewith so as to cause it to set to a hardened cementizious grout capable of anchoring the reinforcing elen in the borehole. In one erJodirnent of the invention, one of the compartments is formed by a longitudinally extending inner frangible casing mnic is disposed within the longitudinally extending frangible outer casing of the cartridge, the annular space between he inner casing and the outer casing forming the other compartment. Advantageously the inner compartment contains the aqueous liquid B and the outer compartment contains the paste A . The hydraulic substance may be a hydraulic cement, for example Portend cement, high alumina cement, dicalcium silicate or metalurgical slag, or a hydraulic solid such as, for example, calcium sulphate, gypsum plaster, or a metal oxide or h lroxide of, for example calcium, magnesium or iron,which is capable of setting to a hardened mass when mixed with phosphoric acid or a phosphate solution which filler, for example clays, silica, limestone gypsum, anhydrite or glass fibre. t required, for example in coal mines, the flammability of the cementitious cartridge may be even further redcued by incorporating, generally in paste A , a fire retardant additive, for example triammonium phosphate, trisdichloropropyl phosphate, ammonium chloride, l trichloroethane, or antimony oxide in conjunction pith a halogenated compound such as a chlorinated or brominated hydrocarbon. Fire retardancy of paste A may alternatively be achieved by using halogen substituted derivatives of non aqueous liquids used in forming paste A . In formulating components A and B of the cementitious cartridge of the invention, the proportions of the constituents may advantageously be as follows Paste A Parts by eight Hydraulic substanca 50 85 Non aqueous liquid 15 40 Water soluble additives 0 20 Water insoluble additives 0 85Component B Aqueous liquid 20 50 Water soluble additives 0 25 Water insoluble additives 0 200 To reduce the exudation of liquid fr6m the cementitious mixture on setting, a substance such as, for example, glycerol can advantageously be incorporated in the paste A and or.in the liquid B . The cementitious cartridge of the invention may be manufactured using a variety of suitable casing materials.To some extent the choice of casing material is dependent upon the relative arrangement of the components A and B within the cartridge. Component A is anhydrous but may contain relatively strong solvent materials, whereas component B is aqueous. Consequently it is possible to use The following Examples illustrate cementitious cartridge in accordance with the invention. EXAMPLE 1 A cementitious cartridge was made by filling in a conventional manner a length of casing of thin gauge tubular polyethylene film 30 mm diameter with an aqueous composition consisting of Water 7 parts by weight Limestone dust 7 tt . and embedding the filled tube within a length of tubular polyethylene film 40 mm diameter containing a cementitious paste consisting of High alumina cement Ciment Fondu 30 parts by weight Monoacetin 8.3 II Each resulting length of filled dual compartment cartridge, having a length of about 10 to 15 metres, was passed through a double clipping machine which forms the required sausage shaped cartridges having an individual length of about 30 cr by firmly clipping each end of the cartridges. EXAMPLE 2 A cementitious cartridge was made in the manner described in Example 1, except that the inner tube was filled with Water 8.1 parts by weight Limestone dust 8.1 I ind the outer tube was filled with High alumina cement Ciment Fondu 34.4 parts by weight Ethylene glycol monoacetate 5.4 11 V Glycerol 4.0
