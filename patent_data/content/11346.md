# Low pressure sodium vapour discharge lamp.

## Abstract
A low pressure sodium vapour discharge lamp having a tubular discharge vessel 1 not more than 400 mm long and not more than 20 mm in diameter, which contains an excess of sodium, helium and at least one of the rare gases neon, argon, krypton and xenon. The object of the invention is to provide a small low pressure sodium vapour discharge lamp which has a lower power consumption than a similar known lamp. The composition of the rare gas filling present in the discharge vessel is defined by a quadrilateral AB CD in a ternary volume composition diagram PQR shown in Figure 1, where P represents He, Q represents Ne and or A and R represents Kr and or Xe. A denotes a mixture consisting of 80 by volume of He and 20 by volume of Ne, B denotes a mixture consisting of 95 by volume of He and 5 by volume of Kr and or Xe, C denotes a mixture consisting of 50 by volume of He and 50 by volume of Kr and or Xe, and D denotes a mixture consisting of 25 by volume of He and 75 by volume of Ne and or A.
