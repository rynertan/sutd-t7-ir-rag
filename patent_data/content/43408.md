## Description
This invention relates to a fan for air convection atomizers as employed in plant treatments. Well know is in agriculture the use of atomizers for liquids intended for treating cultivations therewith. In conventional air convection atomizers, the plant treatment liquid issuestunder a relatively high pressure from specily provided nozzles and is swept by a high speed air stream created by a fan the liquid is thus atomized and sprayed. Accordingly, the operational capabilities of the atomizers thrill closely depend both on the nozzles themselves and the fan generating said air stream, which fans are mostly of the axial flow type and fail to fully meet the requirenients of the atomizer users, On the other hand, in order to achieve a fine atomization of the liquid, high power pumps are required which can deliver the liquid at a high pressure.Such pumps, by themselves quite expensive and power consuming, also require continued maintenance and are liable to failure, which may result in a prolonged inutilization of an atomizer, thus making it imp ssible to carry out the intended plant treatment at the proper tiinc. Furthermore1 such atomizers have often problems of weight, and above all size, which originate from the presence of baffle plates, such as are required to redirect the airflow issueing from the fan, as well as problems of ejecting nozzle cost, servicing, and adjusting, the nozzles being of complex construction, inasmuch as a satisfactory performance of the nozzles involves the provision of such ancillary equipment as distributors and diffusers. This invention sets out to provide a fan for air convection atomizers, which can obviate the drawbacks outlined hereinabove, and in particular can do away with a liquid supply pump, while still ensuring an effective atomization of the liquid. Within the above general aim, it can be arranged that the air convection atomizer fan according to the invention is of simple design, of small size, versatile and reliable in operation, and of comparatively economical cost. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a fan for air convection atomizers as employed in plant treatment, characterized in that it comprises, arranged in a perpendicular plane to the direction of rotation of said fan, and at angularly regular intervals apart, a plurality of blades shaped as a concave trough relatively to said direction of rotation and being elongated in said plane from the fan hub out, and having a convex profile relatively to said direction of rotation, each said fan blade being provided, in a lengthwise direction, with a small outlet tube for discharging a plant treatment liquid peripherally to said fan, the end of said small tube facing said hub being open to an inner chamber extending axially to said hub and axially communicating with a liquid delivery conduit. The features of this invention will be more clearly apparent from a detailed description of preferred embodiments of this fan for air convection atomizers, with reference to the accompanying illustrative drawings, where Figures 1 and 2 are perspective views of respective forms of the fan blades figures la, ib, and le are cross sectional views of the blade of Figure 1, the plane whereat such cross sections were taken being respectively located close to the fan hub, nearly at the center of the blade, and close to the periphery of the fan Figures 2a, 2b, and 2c are corresponding crosssections of the blade of Figure 2 Figure 3 shows a partly sectional and fragmentary front view of a fan equipped with the blades of Figure 1 Figure 4 is a sectional view taken along the line IV IV of Figure 3 Figure 5 is a partial cross sectional view similar to that of Figure 4 of a fan mounting blades like the one shown in Figure 2 Figure 6 is a partial front view of a fan equipped with a liquid recovering casing or hood which is modified with respect to the preceding figures and Figure 7 shows partial vertical axial sectional view of the fan of Figure 6. With initial reference to Figures 1, 3 and 4, there is indicated at 1 a fan for an air convection atomizer, not shown in the drawings. The fan 1 has a hub 2 which is mounted, through a clutch 3, on one end of a horizontal shaft 4 journaled at 4a the shaft 4 is arranged to lay longitudinally to the atomizer and intended for high speed rotation, the rotary motion being derived from a suitable sty up gear, not shown. Externally rigid with the hub 2 and preferably removably attached thereto, e.g. through screw fasteners, are the blades 5 of the fan 1, which blades are arranged at regular intervals around the hub and extend in a common vertical plane perpendicular to the axis of the shaft 4. Each blade 5 is shaped like a trough, which is elongated in said vertical plane from the hub 2 out, and is concave relatively to the direction A of rotation of the fan. In the lengthwise direction, the profile of each blade 5, both at the bottom 6 of the trough and tops 7 of the two sides 8 thereof, is convex, again as viewed in the direction A. Moreover, said two tops 7 and the bottom 6 of each blade 5 are essentially in common with the lateral surfaces of two respective right cylinders sharing the same axis parallel to the axis of the shaft 4 actually, the height of the blade trough increases gradually from the hub 2 and from the periphery of the fan, to reach its maximum in the area of the blade center.The inside cross section of the trough of each blade 5 has the shape of an isosceles trapezoid having its minor base at the bottom 6 of the trough the bases of said trapezoid and the width of the blade cross section increase progressively from the hub 2 and from the periphery of the fan, to reach their maximum at the middle of the blade, the crosssections of a blade being approximately the same both at the hub and fan periphery. The outside cross sectio al configuration of a trough is approximately the s e as the inside one, thereby a blade is flared on both sides, and internally as well as externally. The back of each blade 5 is provided, at the vertical midpiane of the blade trough, with a stiffening rib 9, the height whereof decreases progressiVely from the hub 2 out. Again at said trough vertical midplane, each blade carries a small tube 10, which is straight, radially arranged to the fan, and extended substantially through the whole blade length. The tube 10 is advantageously formed from a metal material, such as stainless steel, and is an insert member of the rib 9 of the blade, which is preferably molded from a plastic material, known in the trade as Nylon, with glass fiber reinforcement. At its end toward the periphery of the fan I, the tube 10 carries a removable liquid outlet nozzle 11, of simple design, for the plant treatment liquid. At its other end, the tube 10 is in communication with a chamber 12 arranged internally to the hub 2, through a respective hole. The hub 2 comprises, in actual practice, a cylindrical tubular body which is subdivided internally by a diaphragm 13 extending perpendicular to the fan axis and defining on one side the chamber 12 and on the other side a housing for the friction clutch 3. The chamber 12 is closed on the front by a wall 14 wherethrough a treatment liquid delivery tube or conduit 15 is inserted axially in sealed rel ti nship. The hub 2 is rotatable relative to said conduit 15, with the interposition of rolling bearings 16 accommodated inside a sleeve 17 formed in the wall 14 on the opposite side to the chamber 12 and coaxial with the hub.The conduit 15, outside of the hub 2, is bent dolvnwardly to an elbow like shape arid carries a treatment liquid filter 18 mounted thereon. In an illustrative embodiment, the tubes 10 have mounted axially therein respective shutters 19, each shutter comprising a pin or needle member which,when displaced axially, closes the outlet port of the nozzle 11. The shutters 19 are actuated through a cam 20 arranged in the same vertical plane as the blades 5 and rigid with a small shaft 21 extending coaxial with the conduit 15. The shaft 21 can be operated by means of a knob 22, external to the conduit, and can be locked by means of a screw 23 acting on the shaft radially thereto. The cam 20 is accommodated inside an internal bushing 24 to the chamber 12 in the hub 2 and coaxial therewith, it being attached to the diaphragm 13 of the hub.The shutters 19 are arranged radially to the bushing 24 and passed through holes formed therein in free sliding relationship each shutter 19 is formed with shoulders 25 and 26, one inside and the other outside the bushing. On the shoulder 25 there will act the cam 20 between that shoulder and the inner wall of the bushing 24, there is interposed a coil sprint 27 moI,,u ted on the shutter 19 and compressively holdi gthe the shutter in its position of opening the nozzle 11 in that position, the shoulder 26 abuts against the outer wall of the bushing 24, and the shoulder 25 does not contact the cam 20.Preferably, the cam 20 is contoured to simultaneously operate the shutters 19 arranged along a substantially 1200 arc, it functioning as a throttling device for the delivered treatment liquid. Of course, provisions are made to deactuate that throttling device by sliding the shaft 21 axially such that none of the shoulders 25 of the shutters 19 can engage the cam 20. Internally to the chamber 12, there are made rigid with the hub 2 blades 28 which are arranged at regular angular intervals and have a concave profile relatively to the direction A of rotation of the fan. he tubes 10 open into the chamber 12 at an approximately middle location of a pair of adjacent blades 28. The, fan 1 is located inside a frame which is affixed to the atomizer and comprises a pair of small walls 29 extending to define an annulus having inside and outside radii which are respectively slightly smaller and larger than the radius of the blades 5 the small walls are arranged in vertical planes perpendicularly to the axis of the shaft 4, one on one side and the other on the other side of the blades. The small walls 29 have each a grid 30 attached thereto shrouding the front of the fan 1, which grid is not shown in Fi t re 3. At their lower perimeter and substantially over 1200, the small walls 29 are located inside a hood 31 which serves for recovering the treatment liquid and which is elongated to concentrically extend along the same arc.Along 2400 of the fan periphery that is, excepting the enclosed portion of the recovery hood , there is defined, accordingly, the liquid and air outlet section. Along said section, there are arranged at regular angular intervals foil elements 32, which are journalled about respective axes 33, which are secur ed between the small walls 29 and parallel to the axis of the shaft 4.Each element 32 has in practice a width dimension which is equal to the distance between the small walls 29 and a height dimension which is equal to the distance separating two contiguous axes 33 the elements 32, therefore, by rotation about their axes, can come to rest upon one another and close said outlet section of the fan The vertical plane containing the axis of the shaft 4 separates the elements 32 into two groups including the same number of elements at their tops, the elements 32 of each said group are interconnected by a respective pair of wire arches 34 which are hinged to said elements.All the elements 32 in one group are arranged in a condition of closure of one of the halves of said fan outlet section in Figure 3, there is shown closed the left iand half , or in an open condition on the right in Figure 3 , of conveyance of the air and liquid flow wherein the elements 32 are substantially radial to the fan. From the outside, either condition is imparted to the elements 32 of the two groups by operating a pin 35, which is preferably carried by the lower end of the respective pair of arches 34 and protrudes outwardly through a related arcuate slot 36 cut through one of the small walls 29 of preference, each pin 35 is provided with a knob which can be locked to the small wall at either end of the slot, thereby the elements 32 are held stably in their acquired condition.It should be noted that, with the elements 32 in their open condition, the pair of arches 34 serve as a peripheral protection grid for the fan 1. The recovery hood 31 has a dual lobe cross sectional configuration, comprising two approximatively semicircular segments, which are symmetrical ith respect to the vertical middle plane of the blades 5 and, at that same plane, meet each other to form a cusp 37, underlying the small walls 29 and facing the blades.At the entry area of the fan 1 into the recovery hood, between the small walls 29, there are affixed and angularly arranged at regular intervals and alternate with one another, further blades 38 and webs 39 which deflect the air and liquid flow created by the fan the blades 38 have a convex profile relatively to the direction of rotation A of the fan, the webs being near a condition of tangency to the fan. Again for the purpose of directing the airflow into the recovery hood, the small walls 29 have, on their outward faces and at their inward edges, a boss 40 with a convex arcuate profile which extends annularly along the entire edge. In Figures 6 and 7, there is illustrated a fan equipped with a treatment liquid recovery device of simpler design, although equally functional. This recovery device, as indicated at 3ta, comprises a hood which is also arranged at the lower arc of the fan and has flat side walls constituting substantially an extension of the small walls 29. The recovery device 3fa has, therefore, a rectangular cross section and extends longitudinally along a horizontal direction tangent to the fan. Forward of the hood, in the direction of rotation of the fan, there are provided a pair of symmetrically bilateral tubes 31b, which are initially divergent on a horizontal plane and in a forward direction to the fan the tubes 31b are then bent vertically upwards, whence they are turned in a rearward direction to converge toward the fan, where they terminate in respective outlets 31c substantially at the location of the vertical planes of the small walls 29. Such outlets have an arcuate shape and are arranged at an upper peripheral arc of the fan. The invention operates as follows. The fan draws air from the front, on both sides, and forces it by centrifugal force toward its periphery the airflow is effectively guided, for as radial as possible an exit, by the channel blades 5. The exiting air meets the treatment liquid ejected rom the nozzles 11 of the small tubes 10 and atomizes it, sweeping the plants with a jet which, with all the elements 32 in the open condition and the cam 20 deactivated, assumes a typical fan like or peacock tail like shape. The liquid to be sprayed reaches the chamber 12 in the rotating hub 2 through the stationary conduit 15 which is connected to the atomizer reservoir. The chamber 12, owing also to the presence of the blades 28, applies to the liquid a centrifugal pump action effective to impart thereto a pushing force in the direction of the radial outlets toward the small tubes 10.The liquid is subjected to a further centrifugal acceleration along the small tubes themselves, so as to reach the outlet nozzles 11 with considerable momentum by the sole action of said blade chamber and small tubes. Thus, the fan enables the conventional liquid pump to be eliminated, with obvious attendant advantages. By changing the rpm sof the atomizer motor, and accordingly the rotational speed of the fan, it is possible to both adjust the liquid flow rate and the jet reach, as well as the atomization of the liquid. For the purpose of adjusting the flow rate of the liquid, it is also contemplated that a specially provided valve, mounted on the delivery conduit upstream of the filter 18, be operated. The fan efficiency is also increased by the provision of the recovery device 31, which circulates the liquid which leaves the small tubes 10 in a downward direction, without the liquid gradually building up in the recovery hood. In fact, the airflow which leaves radially dovmawards the blades 5 while entraining the atomized liquid, is deflected by the webs 39 tangentially to the fan and recovery hood and is directed by the blades 38 inwardly toward the bottom of the recovery hood in the opposite direction to the direction of rotation A of the fan.At the bottom of the recovery hood and cusp 37, the flow, as redirected by the blades, is divided wid conveyed to the two lobes of the recovery hood, which it spans upwardly as indicated by the arrows B, to then re enter the fan frontally from the passages defined between the upper edges of the recovery hood and the bosses 40. Tile thus recovered flow is then ejected from the fan outwards, partly upstream and primarily dovestream of the recovery hood. In the instance of the recovery device or unit 31a shown in Figures 6 and 7, which has no webs 39 and blades 38 on its inside, the airflow which leaves radially downwards the blades 5 while entraining the atomized liquid, is deflected tangentially to the fan, in the direction of rotation of the fan, and enters the tubes 31b to flow in an upward direction through the tubes. Then the flow re enters the fan frontally through the two outlets 31c and is recovered.Instead of admitting said flow directly into the fan , the tubes 31b may convey it into the reservoir, whence the treatment liquid is led to the conduit 15 in this case, the tubes 31b would converge to the narrow section of a Venturi provided downstream of a pump which will only recirculate and mix the treatment liquid contained in that same vessel. The jet of atomized liquid can leave the fan over an angle of 2400, or angles of 1200 on either side of a vertical plane extending through the axis of the shaft 4.The 1200 jet outflow is prevented when either set of foil elements 32 is brought to a closed condition also, in the embodiment wherein the small tubes 10 are equipped with shutters 19, the outflow of the liquid through the nozzles 11, which are located at either 1200 arc, is stopped by axially, and pivotally operating the shaft 21 until the cam 20 moves into a position where it will act on the shutters of the nozzles. Of course, to restrict the jet to just 1200, it will be expedient to both close the elements 32 and nozzles 11. The fan, as shown in Figures 1,3 and 4, draws air on both its fronts, and is particularly suitable for use on trailer mounted or self propelled atomizers. Abere the fan is installed on an atomizer carried by a tractor, it is contemplated that the suction only occurs on one front Figures 2 and 5 . In this case, the blades 41 would have in practice, as compared to blades 5, a single side member 42 facing the single suction grid 30. The recovery device 43, moreover, would include a single lobe for redirecting the air liquid flow to the single suction front. he materials employed, as well as the dimensions, in practicing the invention, may be any ones to suit individual requirements.
