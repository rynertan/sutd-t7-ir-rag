# ANALYTICAL APPARATUS

## Abstract
The instant invention relates to a mass spectometer having an inlet leak and a flow by sampling arrangement. In accordance with the invention, aerosols and solid impurities are removed from the sample by packing a portion of the flow by tubing prior to the inlet capillaries or the inlet leak of the mass spectrometer with a packing material coated with a suitable nonvolatiie liquid. The packing must have the spaces between the particles thereof small enough to remove fine particles while still permitting adequate flow. With this apparatus the solids are collected by simple filtration through the packing material while the aerosols flowing into the packing are partitioned into the nonvolatile liquid coating the particles and are released at a later time into the sample stream as a vapor or gas.
