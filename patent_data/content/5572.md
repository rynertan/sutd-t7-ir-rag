# Improved process for the further processing of hydrogen sulphide containing gases.

## Abstract
A process for treating H₂S containing gases which have also a relatively high CO₂ content, wherein sulphur containing compounds of said gases are converted to elemental sulphur in a Claus plant. The process is applied to gases having a calculated H₂S CO₂ ratio of less than 1. In a first absorption zone 2a, 2b sulphur containing compounds H₂S, COS, CS₂ and CO₂ are absorbed in a liquid under non selective absorption conditions, and after regeneration of said absorption liquid, partly fed to a Claus plan 10 and partly to a catalytic reduction zone 17 . The off gas of the Claus plant is also introduced in said reduction zone wherein any sulphur compounds other than H₂S are converted into H₂S in the presence of H₂ and or CO. The gas mixture leaving the reduction zone is treated for H₂S removal in a second absorption zone 20 with the same liquid as applied in said first zone under conditions which are selective in respect of co absorption of CO₂. The H₂S containing absorption liquid of said second zone is regenerated in a regeneration zone 7 common to the first and second absorption zone, whereby the calculated H₂S CO₂ ratio of the feed to the Claus plant is improved.
