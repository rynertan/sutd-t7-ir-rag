# IMPROVED DWELL AND DEPTH ATTACHMENT FOR POWER DRILLS AND THE LIKE

## Abstract
The improved dwell and depth attachment includes an elongate housing that is attached to a drill motor and has an output shaft that is movable longitudinally and rotatably in the housing for rotating a drill bit. A drive spindle is connected with the output shaft and extends through the housing. An elongated sleeve encircles the spindle and has an end that is engageable with the work piece. An adjustable depth control located within the housing is connected for movement with the spindle. A first portion of the control includes a threaded interior and has ten circumferentially spaced, radially extend ing holes therein. The control also includes a second portion that has a threaded exterior mating with the first portion and has ten slots equally spaced about the exterior. The threads are selected to be loose fitting so that the portions of the control can float relative to each other. A stop screw or the like is removably located in one of the radial extending holes in engagement with a radial surface on the second portion. The holes and slots are arranged so that rotation of the second portion relative to the first portion by one slot changes the drilling depth by one tenth of the screw amount caused by full rotation. Further, movement of the stop screw from one hole to the next changes the drilling depth by one hundredth of the amount caused by one full rotation.
