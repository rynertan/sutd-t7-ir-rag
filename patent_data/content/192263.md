## Description
The present invention relates to an antitumour pharmaceutical composition containing a benzoyl urea compound as the main component. More particularly, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition whereby the absorbability of an antitumour benzoyl urea compound of the formula wherein X is a halogen atom or a nitro group, each of Y and Z₂ is a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom, Z₁ is a halogen atom or a trifluoromethyl group, and A is a CH group or a nitrogen atom, through e.g. mucous membranes of the gut, is improved. The benzoyl urea compounds of the formula I are known to have excellent antitumour activities Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 109721 1982 . However, these compounds are hardly soluble in water, and accordingly their absorbability through e.g. the gut is poor. Therefore, in order to obtain adequate antitumour activities, it is necessary to increase the dose, whereby there is a possible danger of adverse effects due to the excessive administration. It is known that fatty oil is useful as a solvent for injection purposes F. Stirner, Einführung in die Verfahrenstechnik der Arzneiformung, 1973, page 270 . Further, it is known that polyethylene glycol is useful as a solvent or as an ointment base The Merck Index, 10th edition, 1983, 7441 . Further, it has been described that a cyclodextrine can be used for improvement of solubility and increase of concentration of a drug in blood Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 19, 1980, 356 358 . It is an object of the present invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition whereby the absorbability of the benzoyl urea compound of the formula I through the skins or mucous membranes of the gut and rectum is improved. The present inventors have studied various additives with an aim to improve the absorbability of the benzoyl urea compound of the formula I through the skins or mucous membranes of the gut and rectum, and have finally found that certain specific substances, i.e. cyclodextrins, polyethylene glycols and refined oils, are capable of improving the absorbability of the benzoyl urea compound of the formula I through mucous membranes, particularly, from the gut and rectum. Thus, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition as defined in claim 1 comprising a benzoyl urea compound of the formula I and at least one member selected from a dimethyl β type cyclodextrin, a polyethylene glycol and a refined oil.

Now, a specific example for the preparation of a benzoyl urea compound to be used in the present invention, will be presented. Synthesis of Compound No. 3 The cyclodextrin to be employed in the present invention, is a dimethyl β type cyclodextrin. The cyclodextrin is incorporated in an amount of from 0.01 to 100 parts by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, relative to 1 part by weight of the benzoyl urea compound of the formula I. This combination is particularly preferred for the preparation of a solid formulation, and suitable for use for the preparation of tablets, granules or suppositories. As the polyethylene glycol, it is usual to employ a polyethylene glycol having an average molecular weight of from 200 to 20,000, preferably from 200 to 4,000. The concentration of the benzoyl urea compound of the formula I in the polyethylene glycol is adjusted at a level of from 5 to 50 mg ml, preferably from 10 to 30 mg ml. This composition is suitable for the formulation for rectal administration such as a suppository, or for the formulation of external application such as an ointment. As the refined oil, there may be mentioned vegetable oils such as soybean oil, safflower oil, sesame oil or olive oil, and glycerides such as medium chain length fatty acid triglycerides wherein the medium chain length fatty acids are preferably straight chained or branched fatty acids having from 8 to 10 carbon atoms, such as caprylic acid or capric acid for example, ODO manufactured by Nisshin Seiyu K.K. , Coconard RK, MT manufactured by Kao Food K.K. . The refined oil is an oil purified to such an extent that it is useful for a pharmaceutical. The refined oil is incorporated in such an amount that the concentration of the benzoyl urea compound of the formula I in the refined oil will be from 5 to 500 mg ml, preferably from 20 to 200 mg ml. This composition is suitable for the preparation of soft capsules. In the case where the refined oil is employed, the solubility is further improved by incorporating non ionic surfactants. Preferred non ionic surfactants are a polyoxyethylene polyoxy propylene copolymer pluronic , a glycerin fatty acid ester, a sorbitol fatty acid ester, a propylene glycol fatty acid ester, a sucrose fatty acid ester, a polyethylene glycol fatty acid ester, Tween 80 or a polyoxyethylene hardened castor oil. The surfactant is incorporated usually in an amount of from 1 to 50 weight volume , preferably from 2 to 10 weight volume of the total amount. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be formulated in accordance with the conventional methods for formulations. For instance, a liquid formulation may be filled in suitable capsules to obtain capsule drugs. Further, the liquid formulation may be freez dried or spray dried to obtain a dried formulation. The dried formulation may be formed into tablets, capsules, enteric drugs, granules, powders, suppositories or ointments by the conventional methods for drug formulations. As will be shown in Test Examples 1 and 2, the dimethyl β type cyclodextrins increase the solubility of the benzoyl urea compound of the formula I in water, and thus they are believed to increase the absorption of the benzoyl urea compound by the gut. As will be shown in Test Examples 3 and 4, by suspending the benzoyl urea compound of the formula I in aqueous solutions of dimethyl β type cyclodextrins, the concentration of the benzoyl urea compound of the formula I in the plasma after the oral administration is distinctly higher as compared with the control. Further, also in the case where the polyethylene glycols or refined oils are incorporated, it is likewise evident that the absorption of the benzoyl urea compound of the formula I by the gut is facilitated. By using the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, it is possible to reduce the dose of the benzoyl urea compound of the formula I and thus to reduce the side effects or the pain to the patient when it is administered. Thus, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention makes it possible to provide an effective formulation of the benzoyl urea compound of the formula I which has not been possible by the conventional method for formulations, and thus opens a new way for medical and clinical developments. 0.1 µmol of Compound No. 1 or No. 2 was added to 1 ml of an aqueous solution of each cyclodextrin with a concentration of from 0 to 8 mM, and the mixture was shaked at 25 7.5 mg of Compound No. 3 was added to 1 ml of an aqueous solution of each cyclodextrin at various concentrations or to 1 ml of polyethylene glycol 400, and the solubility of Compound No. 3 at 25 20 mg of Compound No. 3 was taken into a mortar, and 5 ml of an aqueous solution containing 1.7 of β type cyclodextrin or 2 or 40 of dimethyl β type cyclodextrin was added under stirring to obtain a suspension of Compound No. 3. The suspension was orally administered by an oral sonde to a group of three Wistar male rats body weight 200 250 g . The dose of Compound No. 3 was 20 mg kg rat body weight. Further, Compound No. 3 was likewise suspended in an aqueous solution containing 0.5 of sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose, and the suspension was used as the control in Figure 3 . After the administration, the blood was periodically sampled, and the plasma was separated. After the removal of protein by acetonitrile, Compound No. 3 in the plasma was quantitatively analyzed by a high speed liquid chromatography as shown in Test Example 1. The change with time of the concentration of Compound No. 3 in the plasma after the administration is shown in Figure 3. In the case of 40 dimethyl β type cyclodextrin, the concentration in the plasma was as high as about 3.5 times the concentration obtained by the control. Test Example 4 Absorbability through the gut The changes with time of the concentration of Compound No. 3 in the plasma after the oral administration were studied in the same manner as in Test Example 3 by using an aqueous solution of 10 weight volume Polysolvate 80 Tween 80, manufactured by Nakayai Kagaku K.K. , 10 weight volume polyoxyethylene hardened castor oil 60 manufactured by Nikko Chemical K.K. , 100 polyethylene glycol 400 or 50 weight volume dimethyl β type cyclodextrin, as the dispersing solvent for Compound No. 3, and an aqueous solution of 0.5 weight volume sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose, as the control. The results are shown in Figure 4. The concentration of Compound No. 3 in the plasma was about 7.5 times in the case of dimethyl β type cyclodextrin and about 5 times in the case of polyethylene glycol 400, as compared with the control. The changes with time of the concentration of Compound No. 3 in the plasma after the oral administration were studied in the same manner as in Test Example 3 by using an aqueous solution of 10 weight volume hydroxypropyl cellulose HPC L, manufactured by Nippon Soda Co., Ltd. , 2.5 weight volume methyl cellulose Metrose SM 15, manufactured by Shin Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd. , 10 weight volume hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose Metrose TC5R, manufactured by Shin Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd. , 2.5 weight volume sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose manufactured by Wako Junyaku K.K. , 10 weight volume sucrose fatty acid ester P1570, manufactured by Hishito K.K. or 10 weight volume Pluronic F 68 manufactured by Asahi Denka Kogyo K.K. , as an aqueous dispersing solvent for Compound No. 3, and medium chain length fatty acid triglyceride ODO, manufactured by Nisshin Seiyu K.K. , ODO containing 5 weight volume sucrose fatty acid ester S 370F, manufactured by Hishito K.K. , or a refined soybean oil The Green Cross Corporation or refined sesame oil Takemoto Yushi K.K. containing 5 weight volume of S 370F, as a non aqueous dispersing solvent, and an aqueous solution of 50 weight volume dimethyl β type cyclodextrin and an aqueous solution of 0.5 weight volume sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, as the control. The results are shown in Table 2. Among the aqueous dispersing solvents, 50 weight volume dimethyl β type cyclodextrin showed the highest absorption, and among the non aqueous dispersing solvents, the refined soybean oil or refined sesame oil containing 5 weight volume sucrose fatty acid ester showed a high absorption almost equal to dimethyl β type cyclodextrin. Further, ODO containing 5 weight volume Pluronic F32 showed a high absorption. A Witepsol W 35 suppository weight about 45 mg comprising 1.8 mg of Compound No. 3 and 12.5 weight volume of dimethyl β type Cyclodextrin, was administered to the rectum of each Wistar male rat having a body weight of about 90 g a group of three rats . Then, the blood was periodically sampled from the jugular vein, and the concentration of Compound No. 3 in the plasma was measured. To a control group, a suppository containing no cyclodextrin was administered. The results are shown in Table 3. It is evident that by the addition of dimethyl β type cyclodextrin, the absorbability of Compound No. 3 increased. The capsules prepared in Example 3 corresponding to 20 mg kg of Compound No. 3 were orally administered to three beagle dogs male body weight 5 kg . Then, the blood was periodically sampled from the branchium vein, and the concentration of Compound No. 3 in the plasma was measured. To the control group, a suspension of Compound No. 3 20 mg ml in an aqueous solution containing 0.5 of sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose was administered. The results are shown in Table 4. It is evident that in the present invention, the absorbability of Compound No. 3 increased. The acute toxicity, the dose and the administration method were studied with respect to the formulations obtained by the present invention. BDF₁ mice male, female, 25 27 g or SD rats male, female, 250 270 g were used in a group of 10 animals. To these animals, the formulations prepared in Examples 1 to 6 were orally administered in the form of a liquid suspension, at a dose of 50 mg kg of the benzoyl urea compound of the formula I. The animals were observed for 7 days, whereby no instance of death was observed. On the other hand, the same results were obtained when the substrate material only or the benzoyl urea compound of the formula I only was suspended in water and orally administered. The dose may be varied depending upon the subject to be treated, the degree of the disease or other conditions for administration, and can not simply be prescribed. However, a daily dose is usually from about 0.1 to about 100 mg kg of the active ingredient. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be administered through oral, rectal or cutaneous route in various formulations as mentioned above. The pharmacological activities of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention were studied. Among the formulations of Examples 1 to 6, the results of the study on the formulation of Example 3 are shown in Table 5. To BDF₁ mice male, 28 22 g , L 1210 leukemia cells were intraperitoneally inoculated in an amount of 1 x 10⁶ cells mouse. One day later and 4 days later, a test drug was orally administered. It was difficult to administer the drug in the final formulation form, and therefore Compound No. 3, polyethylene glycol 400 and the substrate were mixed and administered to each mouse in the form of a liquid suspension in an amount of 0.5 ml. Thereafter, the mice was observed for survival or death. As a result, the antitumour activities of Compound No. 3 was distinctly observed only when it was administered together with the substance specified in the present invention. Within the dose range of Compound No. 3 at this time, no antitumour activities were observed when polyethylene glycol 400 was absent. Namely, the results indicate the transfer of Compound No. 3 from the gut into the blood in Test Example 7, and thus reflect an improvement in the absorbability of Compound No. 3 by the composition of the present invention. The improvement in the absorbability of the benzoyl urea compound of the formula I through the gut by the readily absorbable pharmaceutical composition of the present invention see Test Examples 3, 4 and 5 , is believed to substantially contribute to the effective antitumour activities of the compound. 1.8 mg of Compound No. 3 was dispersed under heating in a suppository substrate comprising 90 by weight of polyethylene glycol 1000, 4 of polyethylene glycol 4000 and 6 of polyethylene glycol 400, and formed into a suppository by a suppository forming mold. 1.8 mg of Compound No. 3 was dispersed under heating in a Witepsol W 35 suppository substrate about 45 mg containing 12.5 weight volume dimethyl β type cyclodextrin, and formed into a suppository. Compound No. 3 was dissolved in polyethylene glycol 400 to bring the concentration to a level of 20 mg ml, and soft gelatin capsules an average weight 600 mg were prepared in accordance with a usual method Tsuda Kyosuke et al., Iyaku Kaihatsu Kisokoza 11 Yakuzai Seizoho Jo p 347, Gigin Shokan . Soft gelatin capsules were prepared in the same manner as in Example 3 except that a refined soybean oil, refined sesame oil or refined safflower oil containing 5 weight volume of Pluronic F31, was used instead of polyethylene glycol 400. A small amount of water was added to 4 g of Compound No. 3 and 125 g of dimethyl β type cyclodextrin, and the mixture was kneaded and granulated by an extrusion granulation method, and then packed into hard gelatin capsules to obtain a capsule drug for oral administration. To the granules obtained in Example 3, 1 of magnesium stearate was added, and the mixture was compressed and tableted to obtain a tablet drug for oral administration. A suppository was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except that Compound No. 1 was used instead of Compound No. 3. A capsule drug was prepared in the same manner as in Example 5 except that Compound No. 2 was used instead of Compound No. 3.
