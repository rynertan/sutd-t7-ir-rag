## Description
The present invention relates to a superconducting device which operates at a cryogenic temperature. It is known to combine in one superconducting device both a semiconductor and a superconductor. An example of such a device is the hybrid Josephson field effect transistor hereinafter abbreviated to JOFET proposed by T.D. Clark et al J. Appl. Phys. 51 5 2736 2743 1980 . This JOFET has a structure in which the semiconductor normal conductor and the superconductor are joined. Electron pairs or Cooper pairs in the superconductor percolate into the semi conductor to a depth corresponding to a coherent length. It is the principle of the JOFET that the Cooper pairs which have percolated into the semiconductor move within the plane of the semiconductor. In such a JOFET, the Cooper pairs are supplied from a gate electrode and so the current gain cannot exceed 1 one . Therefore, the circuit gain is disadvantageously small. Other superconducting devices in which a semiconductor and a superconductor are combined are disclosed in e.g. JP A 57 176781 and JP A 57 106108. The device of JP A 57 176781 uses a semiconductor material which falls into a superconducting state at a temperature 5 below a superconducting transition temperature T An article by V.N. Alfeyev entitled Amplification properties of superconductor semi conductor contacts in Radio Engineering and Electronic physics Vol 22, No 11, of November 1977 pages 107 113, by Scripta Publising Co. Washington, US, also discloses a superconducting device with superconducting electrodes on one side of a semiconductor. There is also an electrode between the superconducting electrodes for controlling the superconducting current flowing between the superconducting electrodes. Thus, this document corresponds to the pre characterising part of claim 1. The present invention seeks to solve or at least ameliorate the problems of the prior art. In a first aspect, the present invention provides a superconducting device comprising An example of this construction has two superconducting electrodes on the upper side of a semiconductor, and there is an electrode for controlling the superconducting current flowing across the superconducting current flowing across the superconducting electrodes on the lower side of the semiconductor. In order to prevent the current through the semiconductor from flowing into the control electrode, there is an insulator film between the control electrode and the semiconductor, or the control electrode and the semiconductor are joined into a p n junction. Another example of the present invention has at least one superconducting electrode between a source electrode and a drain electrode, and the number of Cooper pairs having percolated from the superconducting electrode into a semiconductor is controlled by a control electrode disposed on the lower side of the semiconductor, so that the superconducting current flowing across the source electrode and the drain electrode is controlled. If two superconducting electrodes are formed on the upper side of the semiconductor, the operation of the device is satisfactory if the two superconducting electrodes are disposed at a distance at which they form a superconducting weak link. It has been found that, if the semiconductor is silicon, the spacing between the superconducting electrodes must be not more than 300 nm. This is the second aspect of the present invention. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows a first embodiment of the present invention. An impurity B was introduced to a concentration of 10 In this device, the superconducting electrodes 5 and 6 are coupled by a superconducting weak link when the device is cooled to or below the transition temperature of the material of the superconducting electrode, so that the maximum Josephson current I The spacing between the two superconducting electrodes 5 and 6 is desirably 300 nm or less in order to form the superconducting weak link, and both the electrodes 5 and 6 should desirably be spatially separated. Where a negative voltage relative to the superconducting electrode 5 or 6 is applied to the control electrode 2, positive charges are induced on the side of the semiconductor layer 4 at the interface between this semiconductor layer 4 and the insulator film 3. These charges change the state of the tunnel barrier and the tunnelling resistance R Fig. 2 shows the characteristics of the superconducting device according to the first embodiment. With a load line as shown in this figure, the operating point is at a point A when the voltage V The embodiment shown in Fig. 1 uses a control electrode 2 of p type semiconductor and a semiconductor layer 4 of n type, but it is also possible to use a control electrode 2 of n type semiconductor and a semiconductor layer 4 of p type. In addition, material of the semiconductor layer 4 may be e.g. Ge, GaAs, InAs, InP, or InSb, rather than Si. When a thin film of SiO or Si As described above, n type semiconductor was employed for the susbtrate 1 and p type semiconductor material for the semiconductor layer 4. However, similar effects could be attained even when p type semiconductor was employed for the substrate 1 and n type semiconductor for the semiconductor layer 4 and where a positive voltage was applied to the control electrode 2. Band diagrams of the interspace between the first and second superconducting electrodes of the superconducting device shown in Fig. 1 are shown in Figs. 5, 6, 7, and 8. Each of these figures show the conduction band 7 of the first superconducting electrode, the forbidden band 8 of the first superconducting electrode, the valence band of the first superconducting electrode 9, the conduction band 10 of the second superconducting electrode, the forbidden band 11 of the second superconducting electrode and the valence band 12 of the second superconducting electrode. Fig. 5 corresponds to the use of a nondegenerate semiconductor material, and Fig. 6 corresponds to the use of a degenerate semiconductor material, when no voltage is applied to the control electrode. When a voltage is applied to the control electrode, the band diagram becomes as shown in Fig. 7 for a nondegenerate semiconductor, and as shown in Fig. 8 for a degenerate semiconductor. In the former, the superconducting critical current increases to perform switching, whereas in the latter, it decreases to perform the same. Fig. 3 shows a second embodiment of the present invention. A control electrode 2 was formed by fabricating Nb, being a superconducting metal, into a film approximately 200 nm thick by a sputtering technique employing Ar gas. The film was then processed by a reactive ion etching technique employing CF Fig. 4 shows a third embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, an Si single crystal forms a semiconductor layer 4. The Si single crystal may be of p type or n type, and should desirably have an impurity concentration of not more than 1 x 10 An Si single crystal of 100 orientation was processed as shown in Fig. 4 by anisotropic etching with KOH and using e.g. SiO In the above embodiments, the semiconductor layer 4 which may well be a semiconductor body between the first and second superconducting electrodes 5 and 6 is underlain by the control electrode 2 through the insulator film 3. A superconducting device fabricated in the above way has a small static capacitance in parallel with the superconducting weak link, so that the hystereses characteristics are small, and a D.C. power system can be used instead of an A.C. power system. An A.C. power system hampers the enhancement of the speed of a conventional Josephson circuit and the simplification of the circuit. Moreover, even if the device is of the voltage controlled type and uses a semiconductor, the high frequency response is not limited by the mobility of semiconductor carriers because the tunnel effect is utilized, and a high switching speed can be obtained. Fig. 9 shows a fourth embodiment of the present invention. A silicon substrate 100 having an impurity concentration of 10 The operation of the switching device shown in Fig. 9 will now be described with reference to Fig. 10. The n type channel layer 101 is supplied with Cooper pairs 200 through the first Schottky junction 120 from the first superconducting electrode 102. Likewise, the n type channel layer 101 is supplied with Cooper pairs 180 through the second Schottky junction 130 from the 5 second superconducting electrode 103. As stated before, the spacing L between the two superconducting electrodes is very small, e.g. 300 nm, and the two superconducting electrodes are weakly linked, so that a superconducting current flows across them. The maximum superconducting current I As described above, the p type buried electrode 104 and the n type channel layer 101 lie in contact through the p n junction 110. A depletion layer 111 spreads into the n type channel layer 101 from the p n junction 110, and the thickness of this depletion layer 111 changes depending upon the voltage applied to the p type buried electrode 104. For example, when the reverse bias voltage applied to the p n junction 110 is increased, the thickness of the depletion layer 111 increases. In consequence, the effective thickness of the n type channel layer 101 decreases, and the normal tunnelling resistance R According to this fourth embodiment, the p type buried electrode 104, acting as a gate, is isolated from the n type channel layer 101 by the p n junction 110. Therefore, no signal current flows to the p type buried electrode 104 and the device shown in Fig. 9 is a device which is driven by a voltage input signal. While the embodiment shown in Fig. 9 uses a combination between a p type buried electrode and an n type channel layer, the present invention may also be performed with a combination between an n type buried electrode and a p type channel layer. Fig. 11 shows a fifth embodiment of the present invention. As in the fourth embodiment, a silicon substrate 100 has a p type buried electrode 104 and an n type channel layer 101. The p type buried electrode 104 and the n type channel layer 101 lie in contact through a p n junction 110. A superconducting electrode 220, which is formed by vapour deposition and which is 0.2 to 1 µm thick, lies in contact with the front surface of the n type channel layer 101 through a Schottky barrier 221. Both the end parts of the n type channel layer 101 lie in ohmic contact with first and second electrodes 202 and 203 through n type contact layers 212 and 213 having an impurity concentration of 10 The operation of the switching device shown in Fig. 11 will be described with reference to Fig. 12. Cooper pairs 200 percolate from the superconducting electrode 220 into the n type channel layer 101 through the Schottky barrier 221. The Cooper pairs 200 spread within the semiconductor to a depth corresponding to a coherent length 1 to 0.1 µm , and they move laterally in the semiconductor, so that a superconducting current flows across the two electrodes 202 and 203. The maximum superconducting current which flows through the n type channel layer 101 is expressed by Equation 1 . The normal tunnelling resistance R The operation of the embodiment shown in Fig. 11 will be described with reference to the energy band structures shown in Figs. 13 and 14. Figs. 13 and 14 are diagrams showing the energy band structures at a position A A in Fig. 12, and Fig. 13 corresponds to the structure when no voltage is applied to the p type buried electrode 104, while Fig. 14 to the structure in which a voltage is applied to the p type buried electrode 104 so that the p n junction 110 is reverse biased. When no voltage is applied, the Fermi levels E On the other hand, when a reverse bias voltage is applied to the p type buried electrode 104 as illustrated in Fig. 14, the thickness of the depletion layer of the p n junction 110 increases, and the valley of energy storing the Cooper pairs becomes small. Consequently, the number of stored Cooper pairs decreases, and the maximum superconducting current decreases. Thus the maximum superconducting current which flows across the two electrodes 202 and 203 can be controlled by the voltage which is applied to the p type buried electrode 104. According to the fifth embodiment, the p type buried electrode 104, acting as a gate, is isolated from the n type channel layer 101 by the p n junction 110. Therefore, no input current flows to the p type buried electrode 104 and the device shown in Fig. 11 is a device which is driven by a voltage input signal. While the embodiment shown in Fig. 11 uses a combination between a p type buried electrode and an n type channel layer, the present invention may also be performed with a combination between an n type buried electrode and a p type channel layer. Further, in the fifth embodiment, the number of the Cooper pairs percolating into the n type channel layer 101 is changed by changing the potential of the superconducting electrode 220. Therefore, the superconducting electrode 220 can also be used as the offset electrode of the switching device. The above embodiments use Si for the substrate, but Ge, GaAs, InSb, or InAs may also be employed. The element or compounds of Pb, Nb or In can be used as the material of the superconducting electrode. The voltage to be applied to the gate or the source or drain is, for example, 0 to 10 mV, and the current to flow is, for example, 100 µA for a gate width of 10 µm. The reason why the voltage gain is enhanced by the present invention will now be explained. In the prior art device proposed by Clark referred to above, Cooper pairs are supplied from a gate electrode to a channel, and the Cooper pairs move within the channel. When an input signal voltage changes, an input signal current corresponding to the change flows into the channel, and it flows into a drain electrode. That is, the same quantity of current as the input signal is obtained as an output current. This means that the input impedance of the circuit is small. With this circuit, the gain, especially the current gain, cannot be high. On the other hand, in the device according to the present invention, Cooper pairs are supplied from an electrode which is not the gate electrode. The gate electrode and the channel are insulated by, for example, the p n junction. Therefore, even when the input signal voltage changes, no current flows into the gate electrode. Thus a device according to the present invention is a device of high input impedance wherein the gate electrode is insulated and wherein no input current flows even when the input voltage changes. Accordingly, a circuit employing the device of the present invention, the current gain can be enlarged, and in turn, the voltage gain can be enlarged. The superconducting switching device according to the present invention may be used in coexistance with other superconducting switching devices, for example, Quiteron and Josephson junction devices and with superconducting strip lines including superconducting transmission lines . The superconducting strip line is indispensable to a high speed circuit of small signal voltage amplitude because there is no voltage drop attributed to current flowing through the strip line. This is not available with conventional semiconductor technologies represented by a silicon semiconductor. The Josephson junction device is a switching device of the highest speed. The superconducting switching device according to the present invention can be operated in coexistance with a Josephson junction device, and may improve the performance of the Josephson junction device. Fig. 15 shows an example in which the superconducting switching device according to the present invention and a Josephson junction device are used together. The Josephson junction device is described in detail in Josephson Computer Technology IBM R D, vol. 124, No. 2 1980 by Anacker et al. The example of Fig. 15 has a low current source 920 connected to a circuit in which a Josephson junction device 900 and a supercondcuting switching device 910 according to the present invention are connected in parallel. Under a voltage state, the Josephson junction device operates in the so called latching mode in which it does not shift into a superconducting state unless the current flowing therethrough is below a fixed magnitude. There has been proposed a circuit of the so called A.C. power system, in which a supply voltage is reduced in order to shift the Josephson junction device under the voltage state into the superconducting state. In the circuit of this sytem, the frequency of an A.C. power supply serves as a clock frequency. With the A.C. power supply of high frequency, high speed operation is limited because of large quanitites of crosstalk noise between circuits. The circuit shown in Fig. 15 is a switching circuit adapted to be driven by a D.C. power supply, which is based on the principle that in order to shift the Josephson junction device 900 from the voltage state into the superconducting state, the superconducting switching circuit according to the present invention connected in parallel therewith is switched. Now, the operation of the circuit shown in Fig. 15 will be described. When the Josephson junction device 900 is in the superconducting state, all the current of the low current source 920 flows into the Josephson junction device 900. Under this condition, current flows through the input line 901 of the Josephson junction device 900 so as to shift this Josephson junction device into the voltage state. When the voltage of the input terminal 911 of the superconducting switching device 910 according to the present invention is raised under the voltage state of the Josephson junction device, current flows into the superconducting switching device 910, and the current flowing through the Josephson junction device 900 decreases, so that the Josephson junction device 900 shifts into the superconducting state. Since the circuit of Fig. 15 is driven by a D.C. power source and does not use an A.C. power source, it is capable of operating at high speed. It is obvious from the example of Fig. 15 that the superconducting device according to the present invention and the Josephson junction device can coexist in a circuit and that the performance of the Josephson junction device may be satisfactory.
