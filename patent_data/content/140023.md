# Nuclear fuel pellet sintering boat loading system.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a system for loading nuclear fuel pellets from a pellet press into a sintering boat. The system comprises a drum 22 including at least one channel for holding a row of pellets means 28 for rotating the drum so as to move the or each channel successively to a pellet receiving position, a pellet discharging position, and again to the pellet receiving position pellet transferring means 14, 32, 34 for receiving the pellets 10 from the press 12 and inserting them into the channel disposed in the pellet receiving position pellet row transferring means 44 or 46 for transferring the row of pellets from the channel in the pellet discharging position into a sintering boat 18 or 20 and means 47 or 48, 50, 51 for changing the relative position between the pellet row transferring means and the sintering boat after each pellet row transfer to assure stacking of suc cessive pellet rows in a predetermined order. A controller, preferably comprising a microprocessor, controls and co ordinates the operation of the various system components.
