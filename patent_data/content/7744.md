# Assay for thyroid hormone binding capacity.

## Abstract
In an automated assay for qualitative determination of thyroid hormone binding capacity of a serum sample, serum and T₃ tracer are caused to flow through a chamber contain ing a T₃ binder supported on a solid support, T₃ being triiodothyronine. The amount of T₃ tracer which passed through the chamber, and the amount of T₃ tracer bound to the binder in the chamber are determined thereby to deter mine the percent of bound T₃ tracer. Such percent is then compared with the percent of T₃ tracer bound in a reference sample to determine qualitatively the T₃ binding capacity of the serum sample.
