# Stabilization of L phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme.

## Abstract
A process for the synthesis of L phenylalanines and analogues thereof from trans cinnamate, ring substituted trans cinnamates or various acrylate derivatives and ammo nia or an ammonia donor in the presence of L phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme and a desensitizing agent such as polyhydric alcohols and polyethylene glycol 400 is dis closed. The process embraces the discovery that compounds such as polyhydric alcohols and polyethylene glycol 400 desensitize the L phenyalanine ammonia lyase enzyme to substantially higher substrate concentrations than practiced heretofore. In addition, polyhydric alcohols and polyethylene giycol 400 substantially enhance the instantaneous rate of reaction and inhibit inactivation of the L phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme over longer reaction periods.
