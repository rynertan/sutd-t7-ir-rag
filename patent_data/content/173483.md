# Error concealment in digital television signals.

## Abstract
Apparatus for concealing errors in a digital television sig nal, comprises delay elements 11, 12 and 15 to 20 for deriv ing a current sample value EO and a first group of the sample values S1 to S8 spatially closest to the current sample value EO in the same frame of the television signal, delay elements 10, 13, 14 and 21 to 26 for deriving from the preceding frame of the television signal a delayed sample value EOD corre sponding in position to the current sample value EO and a sec ond group of sample values S1D to S8D respectively corre sponding in position to the sample values S1 to S8 , means 48 for checking the current sample value EO for error, means 48 for checking the delayed sample value EOD for error, sub tractors 35 to 41 and 44 to 47 for checking pairs of sample values S1 to S8 and S1D to S8D and corresponding in posi tion in the current and preceding frames of the television sig nals for errors and for deriving a measure of the difference in the levels of the sample values S1 to S8 and S1D to S8D in each pair, and for combining the results of the checks to pro vide an output signal which is a measure of the number of said errors and of the sum of said differences, a threshold device 48 for checking said output signal against a predetermined threshold level corresponding to an acceptably small number of errors and a relatively low degree of movement in the part of a television picture corresponding to the groups of sample values S1 to S8 and S1D to S8D , and a selector 49 operative, if the sample value EO is in error, the delayed sample value EOD is not in error, and said output signal is below said predetermined level, for replacing the current sample value EO by the delayed sample value EOD for supply to an output 50 , and, in all other cases, for supplying the current sample value EO to the output 50 .
