# A PRODUCT MANUFACTURED OF A ROCK MATERIAL AND A METHOD FOR ITS MANUFACTURING

## Abstract
The object of the invention is a rock product and a method for manufacturing the product in a mould. The product 1 according to the invention includes a nontranspa rent, opaque, preferably light reflecting, crystalline and granular rock material, the size of which granules corres ponds mainly to the natural cystal size of the rock material in question as well as a mixture comprising a mainly synthetic resin and a mainly transparent filler. Thus, as the mixture 2 forms the transparent coating 4 of the product and binds the rock materials 3 into layers beneath the surface, rock product forms, as the substance hardens, which as such and without any working corresponds to the natural rock material with respect to its reflective properties and its impression of colour and depth.
