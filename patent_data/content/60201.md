# Tandem brake booster.

## Abstract
A tandem brake booster with two movable walls coupled to an outer member associated with a master cylinder, and a valve mechanism operable through a brake pedal for controlling a fluid pressure differential across said movable walls to create motive forces thereon which are additively transmitted to the output member. According to this invention, the movable walls 24,28 are so arranged that they move in opposite directions in response to the fluid pressure differential, one 24 of them being directly coupled with the output member 56 while the other 28 is coupled therewith through a reversing mechan ism 100,102 . For use in power brake systems for automotive vehicles.
