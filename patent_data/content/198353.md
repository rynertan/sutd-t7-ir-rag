## Description
This invention relates to reducing electromigration activity and extending life time of terminations in microelectronic devices wherein said terminations consisting of lead tin alloys. Metal conductors carrying a high current density such as those necessary for practical solid state microelectronic configurations are susceptible to a current induced mass transport failure mechanism, in which removal of material from one or more locations in the current path and build up of material at one or more other locations in the current path occurs. Such mass transport phenomenon is termed electromigration , and results in early failure of devices, either due to an open circuit caused in the current carrying path as a consequence of the removal of material or to a short circuit formed as a consequence of build up of material between the current carrying path and an adjacent conductor. For example, in the fabrication of C 4 terminals C 4 is a designation for controlled collapse chip connection , a wettable metal area typically a circle about 0.1mm 0.005 inch in diameter, although other sizes and geometries may be employed is evaporated onto a dielectric through holes in a previously prepared metal mask The wettable metal area is called the BLM ball limiting metallurgy and is formed of layers of Cr Cu Au, with a total thickness of about 1 micrometer. After the BLM is formed, Pb Sn solder typically about 5 Sn is evaporated through the metal mask and the solder is then reflowed i.e., melted to form the ball. During reflow, tin from the solder and copper from the BLM react to form Cu The combination of lead tin solder alloys and copper is described in the prior art. In patent GB A 721 881 a solder alloy is disclosed containing lead and tin in the ratio of about 50 50 and copper in the range of 0.5 to 5 percent of the total weight. The alloy is dedicated to reduce the wear of the soldering tools by providing a tin copper ratio close to the eutectic of Sn Cu. Another tin rich alloy containing a small amount of copper is specified in JP A 58 038 693. Intermetallic compounds of tin, lead and copper are formed during heating to about 400 C. These compounds are described to float in the solder melt at standard soldering temperatures of 250 to 260 C. As a result a better soldering performance is reported. In these documents the problem of electromigration is not discussed or even realized. Moreover the alloys given in the cited documents are containing tin at an rather high amount of about 50 percent of weight. As described above in modern techniques solder alloys typically contain only about 5 Sn. The problem of electromigration occurring within the use of such solder alloys therefore remains unresolved with respect to the prior art. It is therefore an object of the invention to reduce the elctromigration or thermomigration activity in a lead tin solder employed in solder stripe terminations. It is another object of the invention to provide a substantially uniform distribution of particles of an intermetallic compound in a lead tin solder so as to reduce electromigration activity therein. In accordance with the invention as given in claim 1, a method is provided for reducing electromigration activity or thermomigration activity and extending the lifetime of terminations in microelectronic devices consisting of a lead tin alloy by forming a substnatially uniform distribution of at least one intermetallic compound formed from said alloy and a solute element by coevaporating the solute element with lead and tin and reflowing the resulting solder. Solute elements are those elements which form an intermetallic alloy with tin, and include copper, silver, gold and the rare earth elements. Preferred embodiments are given in the dependent claims. In particular, the method comprises forming in a lead tin solder an intermetallic alloy of copper with tin. The intermetallic alloy comprises primarily Cu Electromigration activity resulting from electron flow and the occurrence of sites of flux divergence in a lead tin solder causes open circuits or shorts as material is moved under the influence of an electrical current. Since the lead tin solder contains about 5 tin, most of the material transported comes about by diffusion of lead. At the device operating temperature in the range of 50 to 90 C, the mass transport is dominated by diffusion along grain boundaries. In accordance with the invention, the grain boundary diffusion and electromigration activity in a lead tin solder terminal has been found to be substantially reduced by forming an intermetallic alloy of copper with tin in the lead tin solder. Addition of 3.5 wt. copper to the Pb 95 wt Sn solder has been found to be effective in reducing the grain boundary diffusion of Pb by a factor of ten see Example 2 . The intermetallic alloy is primarily Cu Thus, by adding copper to the solder itself, the formation and non uniform distribution of the copper tin intermetallics arising from the spalling of the copper from the BLM is prevented. Cu A substantial advantage of the co evaporation method is that a very large number of very small Cu Upon reflow, the fine copper particles act as heterogeneous sites for the formation of Cu As a consequence of the method of the invention, the Cu The copper concentration in the solder is maintained at less than about three times the tin concentration in order to avoid using up all the tin in forming the Cu Sn alloy. Further, the amount of copper is at least that effective in reducing the electromigration activity at least 0.5 copper in a 95 Pb 5 Sn solder has been found to be sufficient in this regard. The maximum amount of copper is less than about 10 of the amount of the solder in order to avoid adversely affecting the mechanical properties of the solder. Preferably, the amount of copper ranges from about 3 to 4 of of the total amount of the solder, and most preferably about 3.5 . In this range, the grain boundary diffusivity of lead is reduced by a factor of ten at about 126 C. The substantially uniform distribution of the copper tin intermetallic particles in the solder is essential, since an uneven distribution results in an excessive electromigration at those locations that do not have the copper tin intermetallic particles. Accordingly, a greater current density and temperature due to Joule heating occurs at those locations that do not have such intermetallic particles, after some electromigration has taken place effectively reducing the area available for current conduction. Consequently, uneven particle distribution results in early failures. Without subscribing to any particular theory, it appears that the presence of Cu The composition suitably employed in the practice of the invention is a lead tin solder. Such compositions are typically 95 Pb, 5 Sn however, other lead tin compositions are expected to be suitably employed in the method of the invention. While the use of copper has been shown to reduce electromigration in lead tin solders, other elements having properties similar to those of copper, such as silver, gold, and the rare earth metals. While this disclosure is primarily directed to the improvement in electromigration activity in C 4 terminals, the method of the invention is also suitably employed to enhance Josephson electrodes and reduce Soret effects diffusion in a temperature gradient . The invention acts to slow diffusion in grain boundaries such effect slobs electromigration and also thermomigration. Electromigration data was accumulated for C 4 terminals as a function of copper thickness. These data are shown below. The failure rate was measured at 1.1 amps C 4 terminal at 150 C. As can be seen, the failure rate increases by a factor of 10 Grain boundary diffusion studies of the Pb As can be seen, the grain boundary diffusion of lead in a lead tin alloy containing 5 tin is reduced by a factor of 10 at 126 C when 3.5 copper is added.
