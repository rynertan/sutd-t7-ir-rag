# A PROCESS FOR MAKING ZEOLITE ZSM 45

## Abstract
A synthetic porous crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite, characterized as zeolite ZSM 45 is prepared with a cobal ticinium directing agent. The crystalline zeolite has a molar ratio of silica to alumina of at least 8 and is analogous to the naturally occuring zeolite, levynite.
