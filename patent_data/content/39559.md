# Pilot controlled pressure relief valve assembly.

## Abstract
A pilot assisted pressure relief valve including a valve body 10 defining a first and second plurality of ports 30, 32 and an internal stepped bore 40 that slidably supports an elongate, tubular primary piston 34 engageable with a valve seat 36 mounted at one end of the valve body bore, which cooperate to control fluid communication between the first and second plurality of ports. The piston 34 is biased towards a flow inter rupting position by a spring and is biased towards an open po sition by fluid pressure at the first plurality of ports. A pilot operated piston 70 is mounted coaxially with the primary pis ton and is operative to engage the primary piston 34 and oppo se the spring force thereby reducing the effective relief setting of the valve.
