# JFET active load input stage.

## Abstract
An active load circuit for operational amplifiers and the like is described which provides an improved common mode rejec tion ratio and common mode voltage range, and alleviates tran sistor saturation and cut off problems during maximum slew rates. Drive currents from the operational amplifier or other cir cuit are transmitted directly through respective load resistors R1, R2 , thereby reducing voltage offsets which degrade com mon mode rejection. At the same time the absolute voltage levels at the operational amplifier or like circuit are reduced, thereby increasing the common mode voltage range. A pair of active load transistors Q1, Q2 are supplied with current from current sources I5, I6 independent of the amplifier transistors J1, J2 , and deliver their respective currents to the same resis tors R1, R2 which receive the amplifier currents. An output Q4 is taken from one of the load transistors Q1, Q2 without connecting to either of the amplifier transistors J1, J2 .
