# EXTRUSION PROCESS AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
Formable material such as pigment filter cake is ex truded in filamentary form for drying by means of a ram extruder which eradicates local zones of inhomogeneity. Pressure may be applied by the ram in two stages a lower pressure to homogenise the material followed by a higher pressure to extrude it. Apparatus for carrying out the process comprises container transportable in cage between a loading unloading station and an extrusion station.
