# Method of testing a semiconductor memory array.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method of testing an array 15 of rows 8, 9 and columns 10, 11 floating gate avalanche injection MOS memory elements. In the method a stress test is carried out by applying a stressing potential simultaneously to a plurality of rows 8, 9 or to a plurality of columns 10, 11 of the array 15. The invention is particularly useful in the testing of EPROMS.
