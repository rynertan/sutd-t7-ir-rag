## Description
PRODUCTION OF ARYLOPHENONES The present invention relates to a process for the production of an arylophenone. Arylophenones are commercially useful substances and have been employed1 for example, in the preparation of dyestuffs, polymers and ultraviolet light absorption agents. Conventional prior art processes for making arylophenones include aromatic acylation using an aromatic acid chloride and a Friedel Crafts catalyst such asAlC13, or an aromatic ester Fries rearrangement also using a metallic halide catalyst such as All3 the ester having been formed from a phenol and an aromatic acid chloride. It is also known to prepare arylophenones by aromatic acylation using an aromatic carboxylic acid, with liquidHF being employed as a condensing agent such a process is described in British Patent 1 164 046. The HF catalysed reactions are advantageous in that the carboxylic acids employed therein are usually cheaper and more readily available than the corresponding acid halides, and in that there are no metallic catalyst residues which might contaminate the resulting aromatic ketone. Nevertheless, the use of liquid HF is best avoided where possible because of its extremely corrosive properties and physiologically harmful action and the necessity of using pressure equipment. It is also known from US Patent 3 073 866 to prepare hydroxy arylophenones by condensing an aromatic carboxylic acid with a phenol in the presence of ZnC12, PC13 and polyphosphoric acid. While the patent specifies that the arylophenones are produced in good yield and high purity using this process, it has been found that the product is in fact highly coloured and difficult to obtain in a pure state in high yield. The reaction also poses effluent problems in that the contaminated phosphoric acid residue cannot be recovered economically but must be disposed of.Additionally, the presence of a metallic halide catalyst is undesirable for the reason given ahove. We have now discovered a general process for making arylophenones involving aromatic acylation with an aromatic carboxylic acid which does not require the use of liquid HF or the ZnC12 PC13 polyphosphoric acid system as the condensing agent. according to the present invention there is provided a process for the production of an arylophenone which comprises reacting an aromatic carboxylic acid of formula Ar CO2H n where Ar is an aromatic radical or a group containing aromatic radicals, CO2H represents an aromatically bound carboxylic acid group, and n is an integer, preferably 1 or 2, with an aromatic compound of formula Ar K where Arr is an aromatic radical or a group containing aromatic radicals and H is an aromaticallybound hydrogen atom, to produce an arylophenone of formula Ar CO Ar ,, wherein said process is carried out in the presence of a fluoroalkane sulphonic acid. Thus the process of the invention employs a fluoroalkane sulphonic acid as the condensing agent instead of liquid HF or the ZnC12 PC13 polyphosphoric acid system. These sulphonic acids are liquids or if solids are converted on melting into liquids of high boiling point and do not require the use of pressure equipment. While being corrosive, they are far easier and safer to handle than liquid HF. Also their use does not incur the use of a metallic halide and so they are advantageous in this respect as well. Preferred examples of fluoroalkane sulphonic acids which may be used are trifluoromethane sulphonic acid and difluoromethane sulphonic acid. The process of the present invention appears to be a general one and applicable to the production of many arylophenones. The group Ar of the aromatic carboxylic acid used in the process of the invention may be a single aromatic radical or a group containing two or more aromatic radidals each two or more aromatic radicals may be connected by direct links and or by non aromatic radicals which do not deleteriously affect the condensation reaction. It is preferred that the maximum number of carboxylic acid substituents on any aromatic radical is two, and if Ar is a group containing two or more aromatic radicals, it is preferred that not more than two of the aromatic radicals are substituted by one or more carboxylic acid groups. The aromatic radical s of the aromatic carboxylic acid may be nuclear unsubstituted apart i.e. from possible aromatically bound carboxylic acid groups or have one or more nuclear substituents. The nuclear substituent s where present should be such that its position and nature does not deleteriously affect the process of the invention. Preferred nuclear substituents are hydroxyl, alkyl containing 1 to 5 carbon atoms , alkoxy containing 1 to 5 carbon atoms and halogen preferably C1 or F . Preferred aromatic carboxylic acids that may be used in the present invention have the formulaeEMI3.1 where a is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 preferably 0 or 1 and X is independently alkyl or substituted alkyl preferably of 1 to 5 carbon atoms , alkoxy or substituted alkoxy preferably of 1 to 5 carbon atoms , hydroxyl, halogen preferably F or C1 , aryl preferably phenyl including nuclear substituted aryl m is 1 or 2 and a m t 6 andEMI4.1 where Y and Y are independently alkyl or substitued alkyl preferably of 1 to 5 carbon atoms , alkoxy or substituted alkoxy preferably of 1 to 5 carbon atoms , hydroxyl, halogen preferably F or CI , aryl preferably phenyl including substituted aryl b and c are independently 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 preferably 0 or 1 p and q are independently 1 or 2 preferably 1 b p 5 and c q t 5 r is 0, 1, 2 or 3 preferably 0 or 1 Q and Q are independently a direct link, CO , SO2 , 0 , S , or CR1R2 where R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen, alkyl 1 to 5 carbon atoms or fluoroalkyl Ar is a divalent aromatic radical preferably phenylene, biphenylene, or terphenylene . Examples of aromatic carboxylic acids which may be used in the invention are benzoic acid, 4 hydroxy benzoic acid, 4 chloro benzoic acid, 4 fluoro benzoic acid, terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, 4 carboxy diphenyl, 4,4 dicarboxy diphenyl, 4,4 dicarboxy diphenyl ether, and 4 carboxyl diphenyl ether The group Ar of the aromatic compound Ar H may be a single aromatic radical or group containing two or more aromatic radicals such two or more aromatic radicals may be connected by direct links or by non aromatic radicals which do not deleteriously affect the condensation reaction. The aromatic radical s of the compound Ar H may be nuclear unsubstituted or have one or more nuclear substituents. The nuclear substituent s where present should be such that its position and nature does not deleteriously affect the condensation reaction. Preferred aromatic compounds Ar H have the formulaeEMI5.1 where d is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 preferably 1 or 2 , W is independently hydroxyl, halogen preferably C1 or F , alkyl or substitued alkyl preferably of 1 to 5 carbon atoms , alkoxy or substituted alkoxy preferably of 1 to 5 carbon atoms , and aryl preferably phenyl including nuclear substitued phenyl andEMI5.2 in which Z and Z are independently alkyl or substituted alkyl preferably of 1 to 5 carbon atoms , alkoxy or substituted alkoxy preferably of 1 to 5 carbon atoms , hydroxyl, halogen preferably F or C1 , aryl preferably phenyl including nuclear substituted aryl d and e are independently 0, 1, 2, 3 preferably 0 or 1 s is 0, 1, 2 or 3 preferably 0 or 1 T and T are independently a direct link, CO , S02 , 0 , S , or CR1R2 whereR1 and R2 are independently hydrogen, alkyl 1 to 5 carbon atoms or fluoroalkyl and At is a divalent aromatic radical preferably phenylene, biphenylene or terphenylene . Examples of aromatic compounds Ar H which may be used in the present invention are benzene, phenol, chlorobenzene, fluorobenzene, 4 hydroxy diphenyl, 4 chloro diphenyl, and 4 hydroxy diphenyl ether. The process of the invention is particularly effective when the aromatic compound is a monohydric phenol, biphenylol, or naphthol. If high yields of arylophenone are to be obtained in the process of the invention, it is preferable to employ substantially stoichiometric proportions of the aromatic carboxylic acid Ar CO2H n and aromatic compound Ar H.Thus if x moles of Ar CO2H are used then preferably at least xn moles, and more preferably substantially xn moles, of Ar H should be employed. It is preferable to employ at least one mole of fluoroalkane sulphonic acid per mole of Ar fl. In many cases, however, it is useful to employ a large molar excess of the fluoroalkane sulphonic acid, e.g. 4 to 50 moles per mole of Ar H, so that it may act as a reaction solvent. Indeed, in some cases, the use of a very large excess of fluoroalkane sulphonic acid in order to achieve a very low reactant concentration e.g. the use of , 20 moles, particularly 40 moles of sulphonic acid per mole of aromatic compound , may be crucial to the success of the process. Illustrative of arylophenones prepared by the process of the invention are EMI7.1 The mechanism of the process of the present invention is not entirely clear to us. It is apparent that when the nature of the reactants allows the formation of aromatic ester as for example when reacting a phenol and a benzoic acid , the reaction at least to a certain extent proceeds through the ester as an intermediate and then undergoes a Fries type rearrangement to form the arylophenone, and a notable feature of this ester rearrangement is that it proceeds primarily to yield the para rather than the ortho product. However, it seems that to a certain extent the reaction also proceeds in such cases via direct i.e. one stage nuclear acylation.It is believed that the greater the reactant concentration in the process, the greater is the tendency to proceed through a para Fries type rearrangement via the aromatic ester intermediate, although there should preferably still be at least one mole of fluoroalkane sulphonic acid per mole of Ar H i.e. a non catalytic amount . It is also evident that where the reactants cannot form an aromatic ester intermediate as for example when reacting a chlorobenzene with a benzoic acid , the reaction cannot proceed through a Fries type rearrangement and it is presumed that direct nuclear acylation must be occurring. The present invention is now illustrated by the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 Benzoic acid 0.0244 g 0.2 millimole and phenol 0.0188 g 0.2 millimole were weighed into a small sample tube and trifluoromethane sulphonic acid 0.7 ml about 8 millimole added thereto. The tube was stoppered, shaken at ambient temperature until the reagents had dissolved and the resulting solution transferred quickly to a tube used for nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy. Nmr spectra were run after increasing periods of time when the tube was not being used in the 60 MHz nmr spectrometer, it was stored in a large test tube at ambient temperature under a slow stream of dry nitrogen. The results were as follows 1 1 after 1 hour nmr spectrum consistent with 4 hydroxy benzophenone using nmr spectrum of product as comparison , although some impurities probably present solution yellow.1 2 after 6 hours very clean nmr spectrum, identical with that of 4 hydroxy benzophenone solution orange.1 3 after 7 days no change in nmr spectrum solution rose. On this basis, it was concluded that a clean reation to 4 hydroxy benzophenone had taken place in a reaction time of less than 1 hour at ambient temperature. EXAMPLE 2 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated, but employing 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 0.0276 g 0.2 millimole , phenol 0.0188 g 0.2 millimole and trifluoromethane sulphonic acid 0.7 ml about 8 millimole . The results were as follows 2 1 after 0.5 hours nmr spectrum virtually identical with a standard spectrum of 4,4 dihydroxy benzophenone with little impurity present solution pale yellow.2 2 after 3 hours no change and completely clean nmr spectrum solution yellow. 2 3 after 8 days no change solution yellow On this basis, it was concluded that a clean reaction to 4,4 dihydroxy benzophenone had taken place in a reaction time of less than 0.5 hours at ambient temperature. EXAMPLE 3 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated but employing 4 chloro benzoic acid 0.0313 g 0.2 millimole , phenol 0.0188 gt 0.2 millimole and trifluoromethane sulphonic acid 0.7 ml about 8 millimole . The results were as follows 3 1 after 0.5 hours a marked change has taken place but clearly a significant amount of 4 chloro benzoic acid still present solution yellow.3 2 after 29.5 hours nmr spectrum virtually identical with a standard spectrum of 4 chloro 4 hydroxy benzophenone solution greenish yellow.3 3 after 8 days no change. On this basis, it was concluded that a clean reaction to 4 chloro 4 hydroxy benzophenone had taken place in a reaction time of less than 1 day at ambient temperature. EXAMPLE 4 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated but employing terephthalic acid 0.0332 g 0.2 millimole , phenol 0.0376 g 0.4 millimole and trifluoromethane sulphonic acid 0.7 ml about 8 millimole . The results were as follows 4 1 after 0.5 hours little if any change has taken place nmr spectrum that of mixture of starting reagents .4 2 after 19 hours a marked change has taken but starting material is still perhaps evident solution rose.4 3 after 6 days nmr spectrum virtually identical with a standard spectrum of 1,4 bis 4 hydroxybenzoyl benzene solution rosÃ©.4 4 after 12 days no change. On this basis it was concluded that a clean reaction to 1,4 bis 4 hydroxybenzoyl benzene had taken place in a reaction time of less than 6 days at ambient temperature. EXAMPLE 5 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated, but employing 4,4 dicarboxy diphenyl ether 0.0260 g 0.1 millimole , phenol 0.0188 g 0.2 millimole and trifluoromethane sulphonic acid 0.7 ml . The results were as follows 5 1 after 0.25 hours a marked changed has taken place yellow solution.5 2 after 5 hours a further change has taken place yellow solution.5 3 after 6 days nmr spectrum now consistent with that expected of 4,4 bis 4 hydroxybenzoyl diphenyl ether solution yellow. On this basis, it was concluded that a clean reaction to 4,4 bis 4 hydroxybenzoyl diphenyl ether had taken place in a reaction time of less than 6 days at ambient temperature. EXAMPLE 6 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated, but employing benzoic acid 0.0244 g 0.2 millimole , chlorobenzene 0.0225 g 0.2 millimole and trifluoromethane sulphonic acid 0.7 ml about 8 millimole . The results were as follows 6 1 after 0.25 hours no change has taken place only starting materials present .6 2 after 5.5 hours no change.6 3 after 7 days all original benzoic acid is present but chlorobenzene has disappeared leaked through tube cap more chlorobenzene added.6 4 after 2 hours no product although 40 deficiency in chlorobenzene.6 5 after 29.5 hours no change, so tube heated to 50 55 C under nitrogen yellow solution.6 6 after 30.5 hours a slight reaction indicated at 500C although more chlorobenzene lost more chlorobenzene added and tube heated to 1000C. 6 7 after 22.5 hours a marked change has taken place at 1000C solution dark brown.6 8 after 5 days little further change nmr at 100 C spectrum is very similar to a standard spectrum of 4 chloro benzophenone although impurities are present estimated at about 108 solution very dark brown. On this basis, it was concluded that a somewhat incomplete reaction to 4 chloro benzophenone had occurred after about 1 day at 100 C. EXAMPLE 7 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated, but employing 4 hydroxy benzoic acid 0.0276 g 0.2 millimole , chlorobenzene 0.0225 g 0.2 millimole and trifluoromethane sulphonic acid 0.7 ml about 8 millimole . The results were as follows little or no reaction occurred at ambient temperature or 50 C as inExample 6, so the tube was heated to 1000C 7 1 after 23.5 hours a marked change has taken place at 1000 C orange brown solution.7 2 after 5 days at a further change has occurred to 100 C give a much simpler nmr spectrum similar to that of a standard spectrum of 4 chloro 4 hydroxy benzophenone indicating perhaps a 50 yield . On this basis it was concluded that a somewhat incomplete reaction to 4 chloro 4 hydroxy benzophenone had occurred after 5 days at 1000C, with probably not more than about a 50 yield of this ketone being produced. EXAMPLE 8 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated but employing 4 chloro benzoic acid 0.0313 g 0.2 millimole , chlorobenzene 0.0225 g 0.2 millimole , and trifluoromethane sulphonic acid 0.7 ml about 8 millimole . The results were as follows little or no reaction occurred at ambient temperature or 500C as inExample 6, so the tube was heated to 1000C 8 1 after 23 hours at nmr spectrum completely changed lOO0C and similar to a standard spectrum of 4,4 dichloro benzophenone but with some impurities about 25 present soluton dark green brown. 8 2 after 5 days at little change dark orange 100 C brown solution. It was concluded that a somewhat incomplete reaction to 4,4 dichloro benzophenone had occurred after one day at 100 C. EXAMPLE 9 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated, but employing terephthalic acid 0.0332 g 0.2 millimole , chlorobenzene 0.045 g 0.4 millimole and trifluoromethane sulphonic acid 0.7 ml about 8 millimole . The results were as follows little or no reaction occurred at ambient temperature as in Example 6, although some reaction was occurring at 500C the tube was heated to 1000C as in Example 6 9 1 after 22 hours at completely changed spectrum which lO0CC indicates 1,4 bis 4 chlorobenzoyl benzene with about 25 of impurities by comparison with a standard spectrum yellow brown solution. 9 5 after 5 days at little change very dark orange 100 C brown solution. It was concluded that a somewhat incomplete reaction to 1,4 bis 4 chlorobenzoyl benzene had occurred after one day at 100 C. EXAMPLE 10 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated, but employing 4 hydroxy benzoic acid 0.0414 g 0.3 millimole , 4 hydroxy diphenyl 0.051 g 0.3 millimole and trifluoromethane sulphonic acid 0.7 ml about 8 millimole . The results were as follows reaction at ambient temperature 11 1 after 0.25 hours nmr spectrum indicates that the reaction is well underway orange solution.11 2 after 23.5 hours completely changed to a product having an nmr spectrum consistent with 4 hydroxy 4 4 hydroxybenzoyl diphenyl standard not available for comparison . It was concluded that a clean reaction to 4 hydroxy4 4 hydroxybenzoyl diphenyl had occurred in less than one day at ambient temperature. EXAMPLE 11 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated, but employing 4 chloro benzoic acid 0.047 g 0.3 millimole , 4 hydroxy diphenyl 0.051 g 0.3 millimole and trifluoromethane sulphonic acid 0.7 ml about 8 millimole . The results were as follows reaction at ambient temperature 12 1 after 0.25 hours nmr spectrum indicates that the reaction is well underway orange brown solution.12 2 after 8 hours completely changed to a product having an nmr spectrum essentially identical with that of a standard spectrum of 4 hydroxy 4 4 chlorobenzoyl diphenyl very dark orange brown solution.12 3 after 4 days little change. It was concluded that a clean reaction to 4 hydroxy 4 4 chlorobenzoy diphenyl had occurred in less than 8 hours at ambient temperature. EXAMPLE 12 Comparative Example 2 was repeated on a 0.4 millimole scale but using 98 w w B2SOd Instead of trifluoromethane sulphonic acid. Spectra were taken after 0.25 hours, 6.5 hours, 4 days, 12 days and 15 days. No 4,4 dihydroxy benzophenone could be detected at any stage instead both starting reagents became sulphonated. Repeat runs at 50 600C produced the same result. EXAMPLE 13 The following were charged to a 150 ml 3 necked flask provided with an addition funnel, nitrogen flow, air condenser and stirrer. isophthalic acid 6.22 g 0.0375 mole , phenol 7.05 g 0.075 mole and trifluoromethane sulphonic acid 60 ml about 0.7 mole .The pale yellow solution was heated with stirring to 700C, when it became deep red. 12 ml samples were taken at this temperature stirring being continued after 2 hours, 5 hours, 25 hours and 100 hours. Each sample was worked up by adding dropwise to 150 ml of stirred demineralised water in a beaker. The mixture was heated to boiling and after a few minutes the product was filtered off, washed once with warm water, then thrice with hot water, and finally dried at 1200C overnight. The product samples so formed were yellow in colour. Each sample was examined by infra red ir and nmr spectroscopy and its melting point taken. The results were as follows 14 1 after 2 hours at melting point about 1840C ir and 700C nmr spectra indicate product is mostly 1,3 bis 4 hydroxybenzoyl benzene by comparison with spectra of authentic product although a little impurity is present.14 2 after 5 hours at melting point about 190 C ir 700 C and nmr spectra indicate product is 1,3 bis 4 hydroxy benzoyl benzene with only very little impurity. 14 3 after 25 hours melting point about 194 C, ir and at 70 C nmr spectra unchanged no appreciable impurity .14 4 after 100 hours melting point about 194 C ir and at 70 C nmr spectra unchanged. It was concluded that quite a clean reaction to l,3 bis 4 hydroxybenzoyl benzene had occurred in about 2 hours at 700C. EXAMPLE 14 The procedure of. Example 13 was repeated, but employing terephthalic acid 8.3 g 0.05 mole , phenol 9.4 g 0.10 mole and trifluoromethane sulphonic acid 60 ml about 0.7 mole . 12 ml samples were taken after 1 hour, 5 hours, and 25 hours at 70 C, and then a further 12 ml sample was taken after 4 hours at 1200C. The samples were worked up and evaluated in a similar manner to those of Example 14 the product samples were yellow powders. The results were as follows 15 1 after 1 hour at melting point 260 2750C ir and 70 C nmr spectra indicate product is mostly 1, 4 bis 4 hydroxybenzoyl benzene by comparison with spectra of authentic product although some impurity is present.15 2 after 5 hours melting point 265 290 C, ir and at 70 C nmr spectra indicate product is essentially 1,4 bis 4 hydroxy benzoyl benzene with a little impurity.15 3 after 25 hours melting point 265 2900C ir at 70 C and nmr spectra as for 15 2.15 4 after 4 hours melting point 275 295 C ir and at l200c nmr spectra as for 15 2. It was concluded that a fairly clean reaction to 1,4 bis 4 hydroxybenzoyl benzene had occurred in less than 5 hours at 700C, EXAMPLE 15 The following were changed to a 100 ml three necked flask provided with an addition funnel, nitrogen flow, air condenser and stirrer 4 fluoro benzoic acid 14.01 g 0.1 mole , and phenol 9.41 g 0.1 mole . The solid mixture was cooled to 10 C and trifluoromethane sulphonic acid 50 ml added with stirring. The temperature of the reaction mixture rose to 320C and cooling was applied to reduce it to 150C. The flask and its contents were left overnight at ambient temperature. The reaction mass was poured into 800 ml demineralised water to yield a solid product which was filtered off and washed twice with water. The product was slurried with 200 ml water and stirred for 0.5 hours.The product was again filtered and wasbed twice with water. The slurrying washing procedure was repeated and the resulting solid sucked dry on the filter and finally dried at 800C overnight. The product had a melting point of 156 C and its nmr and ir spectra showed it to be 4 hydroxy 4 fluoro benzophenone. The yield of product was 16.7 g 77 . Recrystallisation from ethanol water gave 12.7 g of a pale pinky brown powder of melting point 166.5 168.50C. EXAMPLE 16 The procedure of Example 15 was essentially repeated except that the reactants were 4 hydroxy benzoic acid 13.81 g 0.1 mole and phenol 9.44 g 0.1 mole . The product obtained was a yellow cream coloured powder having melting point 217 C its ir and nmr spectrum showed it to be 4,4 dihydroxy benzophenone the yield was 19.9 g 93 . Recrystallisation gave 19 g of an off white powder of melting point 218 C. EXAMPLE 17 Using the apparatus of Example 15, the following were charged to the flask terephthalic acid 11.66 g 0.07 mole and phenol 13.18 g, 0.14 mole . The solid mixture was cooled to 10 C and trifluoromethane sulphonic acid 50 ml added with stirring. The temperature of the reaction mixture was allowed to rise to ambient temperature and then, after 0.5 hour, was raised to 500C and maintained there for 23 hours. A further 25 ml of trifluoromethane sulphonic acid were added and the temperature increased to 700C. After being kept for 4 hours at 70 C, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and then added dropwise into 400 ml demineralised water. The mixture was stirred for 22 hours and the product filtered off. The solid was slurried with 400 ml water, left over the week end, and then filtered.The filtered product was recrystallised from 400 ml methylated spirits 100 ml water. The resulting crystals were filtered off, washed and then dried overnight at 1500C. The product so obtained had a melting point of 292 C its yield was 14.9 g. The ir spectrum of the product was consistent with 1,4 bis 4 hydroxybenzoyl benzene although the nmr spectrum indicated impurities to be present that appeared to be consistent with the monoor di esters of terephthalic acid this is quite unlike the nmr scale reaction of Example fl where the reactant concentration was much lower . EXAMPLE 18 The procedure of Example 17 up until work up was essentially repeated except that the reactants were isophthalic acid 11.63 g 0.07 mole and phenol 13.18 g 0.14 mole . The reaction mixture was poured into 00 ml of demineralised water to yield a precipitate which was filtered off and then repeatedly reslurried in water, filtered and washed and finally dried overnight at 100 C The yield of produc was 10.76 g about 50 . Recrystallisation gave a melting point of 193 200 C. The ir and nmr spectra showed the product to be 1,3 bis 4hydroxybenzoyl benzene although the nmr spectrum indicated that a certain proportion of impurity was present unlike the nmr scale reaction of Example 13 , probably the mono or diester of isophthalic acid. EXAMPLE 19 Using the apparatus of Example 15, the following were charged to the flask 4 hydroxy benzoic acid 9.517 g 0.0689 mole and 4 hydroxy diphenyl 11.72 g 0.0689 mole . The solid mixture was cooled to 150C and trifluoromethane sulphonic acid 50 ml added with stirring. A dark red solution was obtained after 0.5 hour. The temperature was allowed to rise to ambient overnight and then the solution was heated to 50 C after about 3.5 hours at 500C, a further 25 ml of trifluoromethane sulphonic acid was added and the temperature raised to 65 C for about 1.5 hours. The reaction mixture was added dropwise to 800 ml demineralised water to precipitate the product. After washing and drying, the yield of product was 18.8 g 95 . Recrystallisation from methylated spirits gave 13.5 g of a product of melting point 190 198 C. The ir spectrum indicated the product to be 4 hydroxy 4 4hydroxybenzoyl diphenyl although the nmr spectrum indicated the presence of a considerable amount of ester as an impurity. EXAMPLE 20 The procedure of Example 18 was repeated except that the reactants were 4 chloro benzoic acid 10.15 g 0.0648 mole and 4 hydroxy diphenyl 11.02 g 0.0648 mole . The yield of crude product obtained was 19.5 g 97 its melting point after recrystallisation was 196 197 C. The ir and nmr spectra of the product showed it to be 4 hydroxy 4 4 chlorobenzoyl diphenyl of high purity.
