# Polyolefin resin composition.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a polyolefin resin composition which com prises 35 to 98 by weight of a polyolefin resin, 1 to 50 by weight of a muscovite and 1 to 50 by weight of titanium oxide as well as another polyolefin resin composition which comprises further 0.5 to 40 parts by weight of a talc per 100 parts by weight of the resin composition defined above. The polyolefin resin composition according to the present invention has excellent light shielding properties, small specif ic gravity which is constributable to lightening a weight, and is excellent in a shock resistance, a stiffness balance and a mold ability at the time of the manufacture of parts such as electric parts and automobile parts.
