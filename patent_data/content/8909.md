# Clutch brake mechanisms.

## Abstract
A hydraulic master cylinder 11 and brake valve assem bly 12 for sequential operation of a friction clutch 16 and a friction brake 17 for a drive member driven through the friction clutch, is arranged such that up to a first given dis placement of the master cylinder piston 24 the clutch release mechanism only is connected to the master cylinder 11 and, above a second given displacement of the piston 24 the brake actuator only is connected to the master cylin der 11 , there being a step change in thrust applied to the master cylinder piston 24 between said first and second given displacements. Such an assembly is particularly applicable for operating heavy road vehicle clutch brakes.
