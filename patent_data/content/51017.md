# Coin acceptor or rejector.

## Abstract
A coin acceptor or rejector apparatus for use in coin operated machines, characterized by a flapper controlling the direction of movement of coins to one or the other of a coin acceptance portion and a coin rejection portion, an oscillator circuit adapted to oscillate at a substantially constant amplitude, a sensing coil surrounding the coin chute, comparative circuitry for discriminating the change in current and resulting voltage within predetermined limits, and a solenoid energized by the change in resulting voltage within the limit prescribed for a genuine coin which moves the flapper to coin acceptance position.
