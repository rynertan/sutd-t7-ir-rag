# Method and apparatus for producing flake particles from molten material.

## Abstract
A method for producing flake particles by projecting a stream of molten material 21 upon the surface of a rotating, generally circular, heat extracting drum 20 , having a serrated edge 42 , with each serration comprising a radial surface and an angularly disposed connecting surface from the base of one radial surface 24 to the peripheral extremity of the adjacent radial surface and rotating the heat extracting drum 20 at a speed relative to the size and shape of the serrations and relative to the rate of molten material projec tion to form a discrete flake particle on each angularly 23 disposed surface followed by removing each particle from the surface after each particle is at least partially solidified and cooling the particles in a surrounding atmosphere. An apparatus for producing flake particles comprising means for projecting a stream of molten material 21 upon a rotatable heat extracting drum member 20 having a serrated generally circular peripheral edge 42 , with each serration having a radial surface 24 and an angular surface 23 con necting the base of one radial surface with the peripheral extremity of the next radial surface and a shaft 22 support ing the heat extracting member for rotation at a controlled speed with means responsive to the rate of projection of the molten material 21 upon the serrated surface of the heat extracting member to control its speed of rotation relative to the rate of projection of molten material.
