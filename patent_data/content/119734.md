# Mould for use in continuous metal casting.

## Abstract
A porous layer consisting of sintered material containing metal powder or ceramics powder is provided as the inner surface of a mould for use in a continuous metal casting, and a shielding plate is provided on the outside of this porous layer by interposing the gap for introducing gas. The gas is supplied in this gap portion between the porous layer and the shielding plate and the gas is spouted out from the porous portions in the porous layer into the middle of the mould, thereby forming a gas film between the inner surface of the mould and the molten metal. Electromagnetic coils are interposed between a stiffening plate and sandwiching frames around the mould and hanger frames supporting them. An annular cylindrical partition wall surrounding a nozzle is provided between the mould and a tundish, and a water cooled reflecting plate having an annular downward reflecting surface is also provided therebetween.
