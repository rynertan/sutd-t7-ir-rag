# Reciprocating conveyor.

## Abstract
Plurality of elongated slats are arranged side by side to form an elongated conveyor, and they are connected to three transverse drive beams in such manner as to form the slats into a plurality of groups of three slats each. Each drive beam is connected to a pair of fluid pressure drive cylinders disposed on opposite sides of the beam so that as one cylinder pushes the beam the other cylinder pulls it. Control valves communicates the cylinders selectively to a source of fluid pressure to reciprocate the slats in a manner to effect moving a load supported thereon in a predetermined direction. The plurality of slats thus form a reciprocating conveyor which moves a load in one direction at a predeter mined speed. In another embodiment, sequencing valves are added to prevent communication between the fluid pressure source and one cylinder of each pair until a predetermined elevated fluid pressure is achieved, so that at lower fluid pressure the slats are driven by one cylinder of each pair at a faster speed than when driven by both cylinders of each pair. In still another embodiment, a reversing valve is included to afford selection of load conveying movement in either of opposite directions.
