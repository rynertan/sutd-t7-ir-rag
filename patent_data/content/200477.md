# PROCESS FOR PATTERN FORMATION

## Abstract
A predetermined pattern is formed by effecting pattern ing of a thermosetting resin film or a film 11 formed on a thermosetting resin film 3 . A multilayer resist process is used in which a thermoplastic resin film 10 is used as the bottom layer. This use of a thermoplastic resin is advan tageous because the thermoplastic resin film alone can be selectively removed by dissolution in an organic solvent, so that the bottom layer can be removed without detriment to the thermosetting resin film 3 .
