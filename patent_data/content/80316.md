# SCRIBING DEVICE FOR FORMING ARCUATE FIGURES

## Abstract
A scribing device for scribing reproducible arcuate geomet ric figures is disclosed. The device has a sliding carriage or trolley which is movable along a pair of fixed opposed parallel rails. The trolley has a sliding platform which moves in relation to the trolley in a direction which is perpendicular to the fixed rails. The sliding platform has a rotatable post passing therethrough with a scribing arm transversely attached at its lower extremity. The scribing arm is generally movable with relation to the post so that a scribing tool at the end of the arm may scribe a circle when the post is rotated. The device of this invention is equipped with means for recip rocating the sliding platform in coordination with the rotation of the post so that perfect ellipses are formed. Also, by sequential movement of the sliding platform perpendicular to the fixed rails, partial rotation of the post and movement of the trolley along the fixed rails various other geometric figures may be formed in a reproducible manner.
