# Magnetic pressure indicator with deactuator for bimetallic temperature sensitive elements.

## Abstract
A magnetic differential pressure indicator is provided for detecting and indicating a pressure differential thereacross that is greater than a predetermined value in a fluid system, having a port 23 that permits introduction or withdrawal of fluid for testing of operability under the predetermined pres sure differential, and having a bimetallic element 60 that prevents false actuation of the element at abnormal tempera ture, and a deactuator 92 for the bimetallic element 60 that permits such testing of the indicator via the port 23 for operability even at such abnormal temperature.
