# A METHOD FOR PRODUCING A METHANE LEAN SYNTHESIS GAS FROM PETROLEUM COKE

## Abstract
A methane lean synthesis gas is produced from the steam gasification of petroleum coke in a fiuidized bed at temperatures of between 650 and 790 C and pressures of between 1.75 and 14 kg cmÂ² using a potassium or sodium salt to catalyze the steam gasififation reaction. The synthesis gas produced contains less than about 3 volume methane and less than 40 volume of steam. Because of its low methane content the gas may be used to produce methanol or a high purity product gas containing substantially only hydrogen and carbon dioxide which, in turn, may be scrubbed to pro duce a gas containing at least 95 volume hydrogen. If the methane lean gas produced from the gasification reactor con tains nitrogen, e.g. when air is used to combust the coke to maintain the temperature of the fluidized bed, then the methane lean gas may be used to produce high purity ammonia.
