The sliding body comprises guide parts 18a, 18b, 19a, 19b for guiding the magnetic tape be tween the pair of tape rolls along the front of the sliding body and a cutout part 20 through which the magnetic tape along the front of the sliding body traverses. When the tape cassette is not in use the sliding body is completely accommodated within the main cassette body and the cutout part is covered by a bottom plate of the main cassette body. When the tape cassette is in use and is loaded into a magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus the lip opens and a part of the sliding body is extracted through the front opening so that the cutout part is exposed outside the main cassette body to permit tape draw out members of the apparatus to enter into the cutout part.
