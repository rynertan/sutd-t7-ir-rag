# Improvements in tennis racquets.

## Abstract
A tennis racquet 10 has a polar moment of inertia similar to conventional length racquets, but is longer than conven tional racquets with the same or a larger size strung surface 28 . Having the same polar moment of inertia as a well playing conventional racquet, gives it the same feel but with greater reach, and, if desired, a larger strung surface 28 .
