# Enzyme immunofluorescent assay for autoantibodies.

## Abstract
A method for the determination of autoantibody in a test sample comprises contacting a substrate for the autoanti body with sample treating the contacted substrate with labeled antihuman antibody selected from 1 a mixture comprising enzyme labeled antihuman antibody and fluores cent labeled antihuman antibody, and 2 antihuman anti body labeled with an enzyme and a fluorescent label determining the enzyme activity of the treated substrate and determining the immunofluorescent patterns in substrates exhibiting enzyme activity. The method is useful for the rapid screening and characterization of autoantibodies.
