## Description
MULTIPLE TRANSISTORTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a multiple transistor with common emitter and separate collectors and bases, made using a monolitic integrated technique and preferably intended for use with relatively high voltages andlor currents.BACKGROUND ARTIn many technical applications it occurs that a large number of substantially similar loads shall each be driven separately by a transistor drive step. This is the case with matrix writers where, for example, 14 impression needles are driven by separate magnets. Transistors for this application must withstand voltages in the order of magnitude 100 V.Another application is the operation of displays, e.g. of the electroluminescent type, which require high voltages.Requirements of low assembly cost and minimum space makes it desirable to integrate a plurality of drive transistors and, if possible, the associated control and pre amplifier circuits in one and the same capsule.In the manufacture of circuits containing N P N transistors, the conventional processes start off from a P doped substrate. A heavily N doped region is diffused into the substrate, the bottom diffusion , and has the task of reducing the collector resistance. A weakly N doped collector layer is then applied by an epitaxial process. P impurities are diffused into this so that the base is formed, after which the emitter region and a deep contact diffusion of N type is diffused down to the bottom diffusion. The N type emitter region is diffused into the base region.An insulating P diffusion round the transistor right down to the P substrate is arranged for insulating the transistor from possible remaining circuits on the substrate. By putting the substrate and thereby the insulation at the lowest potential of the circuit the transistor will be located In an area which is insulated from the remaining part of the circuit by a back biased P N Junction.The space which the insulation diffusion takes up is considerable in transistors intended for high voltages. The thickness of the epitaxial layer must namely be increased for increased voltage, to make room for the deeper depletion region required for the collector base junction of the transistors. Since the insulation region must thus be diffused further down, the region will require greater space due to the simultaneous lateral diffusion of impurities. It is indeed known to reduce this space by depositing P type doping substances under the regions where the insulation diffusion from above is to take place later on before applying the epitaxial layer, but the insulation still takes up large space.It is known to manufacture multiple transistors of the N P N type with a common collector. The individual transistors are then separated from each other by contact diffusion regions, all of which reach down to the bottom diffusion which is common to all the transistor elements. The bases and emitters of the individual transistors are diffused into the wells formed by the bottom diffusion and the contact diffusions. No special insulation diffusion is thus required between the transistor elements.In a multiple transistor with a common collector, the Individual loads will always be in the emitter circuits on the transistor elements. In many cases it is desired to have the load in the collector circuit, e.g. in balanced circuits with a common emitter.Such a transistor cannot be realized with conventional techniques. A transistor with a common collector according to the above could theoretically be driven inverted, but since the emitter would consist of the low doped epitaxial region, the emitter efficiency and thereby the amplification would be low. The breakdown voltage would also be low, about 5 V.The only possibility of providing an integrated multiple N P N transistor with a common emitter has so far been to arrange a plurality of transistors on a substrate with complete insulation between each of the transistors. The separate emitters are connected together by the contact layer. Such a multiple transistor requires a large substrate surface and will therefore be expensive. It is also known from the Swedish published patent application 8105040 3 to prepare diodes with low leakage to the substrate by utilizing a structure where a second bottom diffusion of opposite conductive type Is laid over the usual bottom diffusion which is normally utilized as collector. An annular contact diffusion Is added to this second bottom diffusion to surround the diode cathode which consists of the normal emitter diffusion and associated contact diffusion.The anode consists of the other bottom diffusion which is connected together with the first bottom diffusion.DISCLOSURE OF INVENTIONIn accordance with the invention it is possible to provide a multiple transistor with a common emitter without it being necessary to insulate the individual transistor elements from each other by special insulation diffusions. Here we utilize particular features of the diode structure illustrated in the aboveSwedish published specification, and the characterizing features of the invert tion are apparent from the appended claims.DESCRIPTION OF FIGUREA monolitic integrated multiple transistor implemented in accordance with the invention is seen in section in Figure 1 and in plan view seen from above inFigure 2. Figure 3 illustrates a simplified variant of the circuit according toFigures 1 and 2.BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTIONIn Figures 1 and 2 the numeral 11 designates a P substrate of substantially the same kind as is used in the manufacture of integrated circuits. A highly dopedN layer is diffused into he substrate 11 to form a first bottom diffusion 12. A second P type bottom diffusion 13 lies above the first bottom diffusion 12, this second diffusion being applied in the same step as the lower portion 14 of possible insulation diffusions which insulate the multiple transistor from possible other components which can be placed on the same substrate. A low dopedN layer 15 is applied epitaxially over the substrate, and its thickness depends on the desired voltage resistance of the transistors.In the epitaxial layer there are diffused a plurality of P type contact diffusions In the form of closed Interior frames 17A, 17B which reach down to the upper bottom diffusion 13, these contact diffusions being formed In the same process step as the possible upper part 16 of the insulation diffusion. Along the Interior frames 17A, 17B theres is a contact diffusion in the form of a frame 18 having transverse portions 18A which reach down to the first bottom diffusion 12. The frames 18, 1BA entirely surround the frames 17A, 17B. The frames 18, 18A and 17A and 17B are suitably laid so close to each other that the respective doping substances partially penetrate into the adjacent contact diffusion on diffusion.According to Figure 2, the diffusion region 18, 18A will thus extend 18 round the edge of the bottom diffusion 12 and also separate the frames 17A and 17B from each other. The upper bottom diffusion 13 will therefore be separated into parts 13A, 13B by the N layer of the contact diffusion 18A. N layers 19A and 19B are diffused into the compartments formed by the frames 17A, 17B.The individual transistors TA and TB in the multiple transistor have a common emitter consisting of the first bottom diffursion 12. The emitter area will usually be greater here than for corresponding transistors of conventional type, but for relatively high emitter currents it Is the emitter periphery which mainly determines the ability to withstand current, so that the larger emitter area will only marginally affect the size of the transistor. The base of the transistor elements comprise the separated parts 13A and 13B of the second bottom diffusion. The collectors consist of the parts 15A, 15B of the epitaxial layer 15 enclosed by the frames 17A, 17B, which are provided with the N type contact diffusions 19A, 19B. Emitter, base and collector connections are made with metal contacts 21, 22, 23 of the usual kind. The manufacturing steps for producing this multiple transistor do not deviate from those applied to integrated transistors intended for high voltage, and they have been previously described in the litterature.Multiple transistors of the kind described in conjunction with Figures 1 and 2 can be easily combined with logical circuits and pre amplifiers of a kind which can be carried out with the illustrated technique. It is thus possible for example to use bipolar logic, for example of the TTL type which is separated from the multiple transistor by an insulation frame 14, 16. As is conventional In integrated circuits, the multiple translator according toFigures 1 end 2 has the connection 18 of the first bottom diffusion 12 taken to the upper side of the substrate. This naturally results In a given bottom voltage determined by the resistance of the contact diffusion 18. An embodiment is illustrated in Figure 3 where a considerably lower bottom voltage can be obtained. Here the substrate 33 is of the N type and the emitter connection 34 is made directly to the rear side of the highly doped substrate. In the same way as Illustrated in Figure 1, there Is a P type bottom diffusion 13 on the sbustrate 33, as well as an epitaxial layer 15, P type contact frames 17A, 17B and N type collector contact diffusions 19A, 19B. A deeply diffused outer frame 38, 38A corresponds to the frame 18, 18A in Figure 1, but in this case it has no contact function due to the emitter contact 34 being made on the rear side of the substrate, this diffusion thus having the exclusive task of insulating the individual transistor elements TA2, TB2 from each other and preventing leakage of holes from a saturated transistor. A lowering of the saturation voltage by a factor of 2 3 has been observed with a multiple transistor according to Figure 2 compared with the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1. A further advantage is that a plurality of manufacturing steps can be reduced by the bottom diffusion 12 and possible insulation frames becoming super fluous. When the substrate is common and can easily be given a fixed potential which is the lowest in the circuit, e.g. earth ground it is possible to combine the multiple transistor with controlling and driving circuits using MOS technique. The MOS circuits are then applied conventlaily in the epitaxial layer, either directly into it P MOS or in diffused in P wells N MOS . The gain in area compared with previously known multiple transistors can be considerable. For example, if 4 5 transistors are placed on the same P insulated island according to Figure 1, the space required for P insulation can be neglected and the surface requirement will be about three times less than for corresponding multiple transistors, where all the transistors are entirely insula ted from each other. A further area gain can be made with the embodiment according to Figure 3. It Is naturally possible to manufacture a multiple P N P transistor in a corresponding manner by starting from a substrate of the opposite conductive type N In Figures 1 and 2, P In Figure 3 and carry out the doplngs with substances of opposite conductive type.
