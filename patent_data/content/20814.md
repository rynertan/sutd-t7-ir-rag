# Wet pick up vacuum unit.

## Abstract
A motor fan unit for a wet pick up type of vacuum cleaner comprising a fan section 50 and a separately ventilated motor section 10 . A motor end bracket 30 in the motor housing structure serves as a common end wall with the fan section and carries a bearing 40 for the common shaft 15 of the motor and fan. A baffle 38 carried by the motor end bracket within the fan section has an apertured central portion 52 , at least partly enclosing the bearing, to provide a passage way for high velocity air sealing the bearing from detergent containing cleaning liquid entrained in working air drawn into the fan section. A normally closed check valve 47 at an inlet 44 to the sealing air passageway 51 inhibits back flow of either air or liquid through the inlet but permits such sealing air to serve as cooling air when the entrance of working air into the fan section is impeded.
