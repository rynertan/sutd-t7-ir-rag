## Description
The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic material. More particularly, the present invention relates to a photographic material having a high covering power of developed silver and an improved pressure resistance and improved antistatic properties upon development. The covering power of silver halide emulsions is emulsion manufacturers great concern because the use of an emulsion having a high covering power enables them to save the amount of silver required to attain a desired optical density. From US A 2 996 382, 3 178 282, 3 397 987 and 3 607 278, and GB A 1 426 277 it is already known that a remarkably high covering power of a silver halide emulsion can be obtained by mixing a photosensitive surface latent image type silver halide emulsion having a high iodine content with an emulsion comprising small size internally fogged silver halide particles. From JP B 27065 69 corresponding to US A 3 397 987 it is further known that the photosensitivity can be increased by adding a polyoxyethylene compound to a silver halide emulsion layer having the above composition. It has now been observed that when the above described polyoxyethylene compound is added to a silver halide emulsion layer comprising a photosensitive surface latent image type silver halide emulsion and an emulsion of internally fogged silver halide particles, the developing speed and the covering power of development silver are increased. However, the photographic material thus prepared is disadvantageous in that when developed by means of a roller type automatic developing apparatus, it is susceptible to pressure blackening hereinafter referred to as roller mark by rollers. It is also disadvantageous in that when the above disclosed polyoxyethylene compound is used in a relatively large amount to lower the surface resistivity and improve the antistatic properties of the photographic material, its susceptibility to roller marks is further aggravated. In short, it has not so far been possible for anti roller mark properties and the antistatic properties to be improved at the same time. It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a silver halide photographic material having a high covering power of developed silver and an improved pressure resistance and improved antistatic properties upon development. As a result of intensive studies to solve the above prior art disadvantages, it has been found that the above object can be accomplished by the following silver halide photographic material.

The polymer may contain two or more kinds of monomer units as A to provide a composite function. Examples of suitable compounds which may be used as the polymer include the following compounds wherein the subindex is represented in terms of molar percentage . In the present invention, the polymer having repeating units of formula III which is added to the photographic emulsion layer and or auxiliary layer preferably has a weight average molecular weight of from 5,000 to 200,000, more preferably from 7,000 to 100,000, and most preferably from 9,000 to 70,000. The added amount of such a polymer is optionally selected. However, the optimum added amount of the polymer required to improve the covering power depends on the type of the photographic emulsion used. The weight average molecular weight of the dextran used in the present invention is preferably from 10,000 to 300,000, more preferably from 15,000 to 100,000, and most preferably from 20,000 to 70,000. Examples for such a dextran is a product obtained by reducing the molecular weight of a dextran producing bacteria, such as Leuconostoc mesenteroides, or a native dextran obtained by an action of dextran sucrose separated from a culture of such a bacteria on a sucrose solution.

Anyway, when the polymer used in the present invention is added to layers of the photographic material, it should be taken into account that the weight proportion of polymer to binder contained in the layer containing the polymer is not remarkably different between adjacent layers, although the degree of the difference depends on the molecular weight of the polymer. In particular, in order to obtain excellent adhesion the polymer density of the photographic emulsion layer adjacent to the support is preferably not greater than that of other photographic emulsion layers, and is preferably 30 or less by weight based on the weight of the binder contained in the photographic emulsion layer adjacent to the support. When the polymer is added to the non sensitive gelatin outermost layer, it should be taken into account that the polymer density of the outermost layer be not greater than that of any other layer. However, when a polyacrylamide having a low molecular weight not more than 10,000 is added, the outermost layer or the lowermost layer may have the greatest polymer density. The polymer and dextran may be added to the emulsion in any step, but is preferably added to the emulsion after the second aging and before being applied on the support. The polymer and dextran may be added to the emulsion in the form of powder but is advantageously added to the emulsion in the form of a 5 to 20 aqueous solution.

The compound of formula IV may be used in an amount of from 1 x 10 ⁵ to 1 x 10 ¹ mole, and preferably 1 x 10 ⁴ to 1 x 10 ² mole per mole of internally fogged particulate silver halide. The most preferable amount of the compound of formula IV is a value in the vicinity of the saturated amount of adsorption to the surface of the internally fogged particles. The addition of the compound of formula IV to the internally fogged silver halide emulsion can be accomplished by directly dispersing the compound in a hydrophilic colloid or dissolving the compound in an organic solvent such as methanol and ethylene glycol, add then adding the dispersion or solution to the hydrophilic colloid. If an emulsion layer comprises an internally fogged silver halide emulsion and a photosensitive silver halide emulsion, it is preferable that the compound of formula IV is added to the internally fogged siler halide emulsion before the two emulsions are mixed with each other. The sensitivity of the photosensitive silver halide emulsion is higher than that of the internally fogged silver halide emulsion. More particularly, the sensitivity of the internally fogged silver halide emulsion is 1 10 times or less, preferably 1 100 times or less that of the photosensitive silver halide emulsion. The term sensitivity used in the foregoing description is as defined later. As the photosensitive silver halide emulsion there may be used a normal silver halide emulsion such as surface latent image type emulsion. The surface latent image type silver halide emulsion used herein is an emulsion which shows a greater sensitivity, preferably two times or more sensitivity, when surface developed than when internally developed after being exposed to light for 1 to 1 100 seconds. wherein S is the sensitivity and Eh represents the exposure required to obtain the intermediate density Dmax Dmin between the maximum density Dmax and the miniumum density Dmin . Development is carried out in a developing solution shown below, at a temperature of 20 C for 10 minutes. An emulsion is treated in a bleaching solution containing 3 g ℓ of red prussiate and 0.0126 g ℓ of phenosaphranine at a temperature of about 20 C for 10 minutes. The emulsion thus treated is washed with water for 10 minutes, and then developed with a developing solution as described below at a temperature of 20 C for 10 minutes. Examples of silver halide used in the surface latent image type silver halide emulsion include silver chloroiodide, silver iodobromide, and silver chloroiodobromide. Silver iodobromide is preferably used. The content of silver iodide is preferably within the range of from 1 to 30 mole , and more preferably within the range of from 3 to 10 mole .

The particle size distribution may be either small or large. The silver halide particles in the emulsion may be in the form of either regular crystals such as cubic or octahedral, or irregular crystals such as spherical or plate like tabular or in the form of composite thereof. The particles may also comprise a mixture of particles in the form of various crystalline shapes. Preferably used in the present invention are plate shaped particles having a diameter 5 times or more greater than its thickness. With respect to such plate shaped particles there are detailed descriptions, for example, in U.S. Patents 4,434,226 and 4,434,227 and Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 127,921 83. The photographic emulsion of the present invention may be prepared by processes described in P. Glafkides, Alternatively, a process of forming particles in excess silver ions, that is, so called reverse mixing process may be used. As one form of the double jet process there may be used a process of maintaining pAg of the liquid phase in which silver halide is produced constant, that is, so called controlled double jet process. This process can provide an emulsion of particulate silver halide having a regular crystalline shape and a nearly uniform particle size. Two or more silver halide emulsions prepared separately may be mixed with each other to form the photographic emulsion of the present invention. A cadmium salt, a zinc salt, a lead salt, a thallium salt, a iridium salt, or a complex salt thereof, a rhodium salt or a complex salt thereof, or an iron salt or a complex salt thereof may be allowed to exist in the process of formation of particulate silver halide or physical aging. These metal compounds are used in order to obtain effects such as sensitizing, stabilizing, or retarding reciprocity failure. As the photosensitive silver halide emulsion there may be used an emulsion which has not been chemically sensitized, i.e., primitive emulsion. However, a chemically sensitized emulsion is normlly used. The chemical sensitization may be effected by the process described in the above described P. Glafkides, Sulfur sensitization processes, using a compound or active gelatin containing sulfur, which is capable of reacting with silver ions, reduction sensitization process using a reducing material, or noble metal sensitization process using gold or other noble metal compond may be employed, singly or in combination. As such a sulfur sensitizer there may be used thiosulfate, thiourea, thiazoles, rhodanines, etc. Examples of these compounds include those described in U.S. Patents 1,574,944, 2,410,689, 2,278,947, 2,728,668, 3,656,955, 4,032,928, and 4,067,740. As such a reduction sensitizer there may be used stannous salts, amines hydrozine derivatives, formamidinesulfinic acid, or silane compounds. Examples of these compounds include those described in U.S. Patents 2,487,850, 2,419,974, 2,518,698, 2,983,609, 2,983,610, 2,694,637, 3,930,867, and 4,054,458. For noble metal sensitization a complex salt of the group VIII metal such as platinum, iridium, and palladium, as well as gold complex salts that may be used. Examples of such complex salts include those described in U.S. Patents 2,399,083 and 2,448,060 and British Patent No. 618,061. The photographic material of the present invention may contain a hydrophilic colloid as a binder. Examples of such a colloid which may be used for this purpose include gelatin, colloidal albumin, polysaccharide, cellulose derivatives, synthetic resins, polyvinyl compounds containing, for example, polyvinyl alcohol derivatives, acrylamide polymers, and other hydrophilic colloids commonly used in the art. A hydrophobic colloid, for example, a dispersion of polyvinyl compound, i.e., a compound capable of improving the dimensional stability of the photographic material may be contained therein together with the hydrophilic colloid. Examples of such a compound include water insoluble polymers prepared by polymerization of vinyl monomers such as alkylacrylates or alkylmethacrylates, acrylic acid, and sulfoalkylacrylates or sulfoaklkylmethacrylates. In order to prevent reduction of sensitivity or fogging during manufacture, storage, or treatment of the photographic material, the above photographic emulsion may contain various compounds. Examples of such compounds include a large number of compounds, such as 4 hydroxy 6 methyl 1, 3,3a,7 tetrazaindene, 3 methyl benzothiazole, 1 phenyl 5 mercaptotetrazole, heterocyclic compounds, mercury containing compounds, mercapto compounds, metal salts, etc. One example of such compounds which may be used is described in K.

The sensitizing dye of the present invention may be used in the same concentration as used in normal negative type silver halide emulsion. In particular, the sensitizing dye is preferably used in a concentration such that it does not substantially deteriorate the inherent sensitivity of the silver halide emulsion. Accordingly, the sensitizing dye is preferably used in a concentration of from about 1.0 x 10 ⁵ to about 5 x 10 ⁴ mol, and more preferably from about 4 x 10 ⁵ to about 2 x 10 ⁴ mol per mole of silver halide. In the photographic material of the present invention, the photographic emulsion layer and other layers are applied on one or both sides of a flexible support of a type which is commonly used for photographic material. Examples of useful flexible supports include film made of synthetic high polymer such as cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, pollystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate, baryta layer, and paper on which an α olefin polymer such as polyethylene, polypropylene, and ethylene butene copolymer is applied or laminated. In the preparation of the present photographic material, the photographic emulsion layer and other hydrophilic colloidal layers may be applied on a support or other layers by various known coating processes. These coating processes include a dip coating process, roller coating process, curtain coating process, and extrusion coating process. The present invention can be applied to any field where a photographic material having a high sensitivity or contrast is required. For example, the present photographic material can be used as X ray photographic material, lithographic photographic material, negative type black and white photographic material, negative type color photographic material, or color papr photographic material. Alternatively, the photographic material can be used as diffusion transfer photographic material or color diffusion transfer photographic material on which positive images are formed by the process in which undeveloped silver halide is dissolved and then precipitated on the image receiving layer adjacent to the silver halide emulsion layer. The photographic processing of the present photographic material may be accomplished by any of known processes and treating liquids, e.g., as described in The developer used for black and white photographic processing may contain a known developing agent. As such a developing agent there may be used a dihydroxybenzene such as hydroquinone, a 3 pyrazolidone such as 1 phenyl 3 pyrazolidone, or an aminophenol such as N methyl p aminophenol, singly or in combination. The photographic processing of the present photographic material may also be accomplished with a developer containing imidazole as a solvent of silver halide as described in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 78535 82. Alternatively, a developer containing a solvent of silver halide and additives such as an indazole and a triazole as described in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 37643 83 may be used. The developer used in the present invention may also contain a known preservative, alkali agent, pH buffer, and antifoggant. Furthermore, the developer may optionally contain a dissolution assistant, toning agent, development accelerator, surface active agent, anti foaming agent, water softener, hardening agent, and viscosity donor. A so called lithographic developing process can be applied for the photographic emulsion of the present invention. The lithographic developing process is a developing process which is carried out infectiously under the condition of a low sulfite ion concentration with a dihydroxy benzene as a developing agent for the purpose of photographic reproduction of line images or network photographic reproduction of half tone images. For details see Mason One of specific forms of developing processes is a process in which a photographic material which has previously been allowed to contain a developing agent in, for example, the emulsion layer, is treated with an alkaline aqueous solution so that it is developed. Hydrophobic developing agents may be allowed to exist in the emulsion layer by various processes, as described in As a fixing liquid a composition may be used which is commonly used in the art. Example of suitable fixing agents include thiosulfate, thiocyanate, and other organic sulfur compounds which are known as effective fixing agents. These fixing agents may optionally contain a water soluble aluminum salt as a hardning agent. The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples An aqueous solution of silver nitrate and an aqueous solution of potassium bromide and potassium iodide were simultaneously added to an aquaous solution of potassium bromide, potassium iodide and gelatin in a container by an ammonia process to prepare a silver iodobromide AgI 4 mole having elliptical and thick plate like particles with an average diameter of 1.0 µm. The emulsion thus prepared was washed in the normal precipitation process, and then chemically sensitized by a gold sulfur sensitization process using chlorauric acid and sodium thiosulfate. 4 hydroxy 6 methyl 1,3,3a,7 tetrazaindene was added to the emulsion thus sensitized as a stabilizer to obtain a photographic silver iodobromide emulsion A. An aqueous solution of silver nitrate and a mixed aqueous solution of potassium bromide and sodium chloride were simultaneously added to a 2 wt gelatin aqueous solution while the latter was being stirred at a temperature of 55 C to prepare core particles. The mixture thus prepared was heated to a temperature of 75 C. Proper amounts of sodium hydroxide and silver nitrate were then added to the mixture which was then aged for 15 minutes to form fogged nuclei on the core particles. The mixture was allowed to cool to a temperature of 55 C. Proper amounts of acetic acid and potassium bromide were added to the mixture so that the pH and pAg values were returned to the initial values. An aqueous solution of silver nitrate and a mixed aqueous solution of potassium bromide and sodium chloride were simultaneously added to the mixture. The product was then desalted in a conventional condensation process, and then re dispersed into an aqueous gelatin solution. The dispersion was then allowed to absorb a mercapto compound shown below to prepare an emulsion B 1 of silver chlorobromide having an average particle size of 0.3 µm. 5 parts by weight as silver content of emulsion A and 1 part as silver content by weight of emulsion B 1 were mixed with each other. 4 hydroxy 6 methyl 1,3,3a,7 tetrazaindene as a stabilizer, a dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid salt as a coating assistant, and a poly potassium p vinyl benzenesulfonate compound and a mesoionic triazolium compound as thickening agents were added to the mixture to prepare a coating composition. The silver to gelatin proportion of the coating solution was 1.0. A 10 wt gelatin aqueous solutions were prepared containing gelatin, sodium polystyrenesulfonate as a thickening agent, particulate polymethylmethacrylate average particle size 3.0 µm as a matting agent, N,N ethylenebis vinylsulfonylacetoamide as a hardening agent, sodium t octylphenoxyethoxyethanesulfonate as a coating assistant, one of the polyoxyethylenic surface active agents shown in Table 1 and a substantially non photosensitive particulate silver chlorobromide emulsion. In the comparison examples the following polyoxyethylenic surface active agents were used The emulsion coating composition prepared in the process 3 was applied on both sides of a polyethyleneterephthalate support so that the applied amount reached 2.5 g m² in terms of amount of silver. The coating composition prepared in the process 4 was applied on both sides of the support so that the applied applied on both sides of the support so that the applied amount on each side of the support reached 1.2 g m² in terms of amount of gelatin. After being stored at a temperature of 25 C and a humidity of 65 RH relative humidity for 7 days, these specimens were exposed to a blue light having a wavelength range of 360 to 480 nm, with its peak intensity centered at 414 nm, throuh a continuous wedges. The specimens thus light exposed were then developed and fixed with the following treating solution at a temperature of 35 C for 25 seconds. The sepcimens thus treated were then fixed with the following fixing solution, washed with water and dried. The specimens of photographic material thus treated were measured for sensitometry. The results are shown in Table 1. In Table 1, the value of sensitivity was determined as reciprocal of the exposure required to obtain a transmission light density of fog 0.3 in terms of the value relative to that of specimen No. 1 as 100. The gamma value was determined as the slope between density value of fog 0.25 and fog 2.0 on the characteristic curve. In addition to the sensitivity values and the gamma values, the maximum transmission density Dmax was determined. The maximum transmission density Dmax was divided by the amount of development silver g m² to obtain a coverage of developed silver hereinafter referred to as CP , which is also shown in Table 1. The pressure resistance of the phtoographic material upon development resistance to pressure marks, i.e., roller marks formed by rollers of an automatic developing apparatus was evaluated as follows The specimen was exposed to light by a sensitomenter. The specimen thus light exposed was subjected to development at a temeprature of 35 C for 25 seconds. The development was conducted by means of an automatic X ray developing apparatus equipped with special 90 second opposition rollers having roguth surface. The previously described developer was used. The degree of the roller marks thus formed on the specimen were classified into five stages for evaluation. The antistatic properties hereinafter referred to as AS were evaluated as follows The antistatic properties were determined by the measurement of the surface resistivity hereinafter referred to as SR and the static marks formed. The specimen was clamped between two brass electrodes having a length of 10 cm and a gap of 0.14 cm. The contact surface of the electrodes was made of stainless steel. The measurement was conducted by means of an insulation tester TAKEDA RIKEN Model TR 8651 . The value reached 1 minute after application was used. The unexposed photographic material was laminated on a rubber sheet in such a manner that the surface of the photographic material containing an antistatic agent was opposed thereto. The lamination was then pressed from its upper side the side of the photographic material by a rubber roller. The specimen was peeled off from the rubber sheet so that static marks were formed thereon. The measurement of the surface resisitvity was conducted at a temperature of 25 C and humidity of 25 RH. The formation of static marks was conducted under the same conditions. The adjustment of the humidity of the specimen was conducted by storing them under these conditions overnight. For evaluation of the static marks thus formed, the specimen was developed at a temperature of 35 C for 25 seconds with the developer aforementioned. The degree of the static marks were classfied into the following five stages As can be seen in Table 1, any specimen showed a remarkable increase in the covering power and relative sensitivity caused by the addition of the polyethylene oxide compound. However, the specimens containing the polyethylene oxide compound of the present invention surprisingly showed acceptable anti roller mark properties while those contaiing the polyethylene oxide compound of the comparison examples showed remarkably poor anti roller marks properties which are unacceptable. The polyethylene oxide compound of the present invention is also excellent in improvement in antistatic properties as compared to those of comparison examples. Specimens were prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the emulsion of internally fogged particles was replaced by the following emulsion The preparation of the emulsion of internally fogged particles was conducted as follows. Particles were formed in such a manner that the sensitivity thereof reached 1 100 or less of that of the emulsion of Example 1, by the process described in U.S. Patent 2,592,250. The particles were then internally fogged by light. The particles thus fogged were allowed to adsorb the mercapto compound B 1 of Example 1 to obtain an internally fogged silver chlorobromide emulsion AgCl 9 mol having an average particle diamenr of 0.33 µm. The emulsion thus prepared was used for the measurement of the varioius evaluation tests. The results showed that the specimens made of the emulsion containng the polyethylene oxide compound of the present invention is remarkably excellent in anti roller mark properaties and AS properties as compared to the specimens containing the polyethylene oxide compound of the comparison examples. 4 parts by weight as silver content of the emulsion A prepared in Example 1 and 2 parts by weight as silver content of the emulsion B 1 prepared in Example 1 were mixed with each other. 4 hydroxy 6 methyl 1,3,3a,7 tetrazaindene as a stabilizer, a dodecylbenzenesulfonate as a coating assistance, sodium polystyrenesulfonate as a thickening agent, a mesoionic triazorium compound and a sensitizing dye having a peak absorption in the range of blue light were added to the mixture to prepare a coating composition. 20 of the gelatin contained in the coating composition were replaced by a mixture of polyacrylamide and dextran. The silver to gelatin weight proportion of the coating composition thus prepared was 1.25. A coating composition was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1, except that the type of the polyoxyethylenic surface active agent was different from that of Example 1 and 20 of the gelatin contained in the composition was replaced by a mixture of polyacrylamide and dextran. The gelatin concentration of the coating solution thus prepared was 8 . These tests were conducted in the same manner as in Example 1. The results are shown in Table 2. As can be seen in Table 2, any specimen showed a remarkable increase in the covering power and relative sensitivity caused by the addition of the polyethylene oxide compound. However, the specimens containing the present polyethylene oxide compounds showed acceptable anti roller mark properties, while those containing the polyethylene oxide compounds of the comparison exmaples showed remarkably poor anti roller mark properties which are unacceptable. The prsent polyethylene oxide compounds are also excellent in improvement in AS properties as compared to the comparison examples. Specimens were prepared in the same manner as in Example 3 except that the monomethine dye having a peak absorption in blue range was replaced by a sensitizing dye having a peak absorption in green range in the preparation of the emulsion coating composition and the sensitometry was conducted by a green light having a high peak intensity at 550 nm. These specimens showed the same results as in Example 3. As is apparent from the foregoing description, the present invention provides a silver halide photographic material which enables improvements in pressure resistance and antistatic properties and gives a remarkably high coverage of developed silver covering power . An emulsion was prepared in the same manner as 1 in Example 1. An emulsion was preapred in the same manner as 2 in Example 1. An emulsion eas prepared in the same manner as 3 in Example 1. Polyacrylamide of compound III 1 A coating composition was prepared comprising gelatin, sodium polyethylenesulfonate as a thickening agent, particulate polymethyl methacrylate average particle size 3.0 µm as a matting agent, N,N ethylenebis vinylsulfonylacetamide as a harderner, sodium t octylphenoxyethoxyethanesulfonate as coating assistans and polyoxyethylenic surface active agnet II 10, and a substantially nonsensitive silver chlorobromide particle emulsion. Polyacrylamide of compound III 1 The emulsion coating composition prepared in the process 3 was applied on both sides of a polyethyleneterephthalate support in such a manner trhat the applied amount on each side reached 2.5 g m² amd 1 63 g m² in terms of amounts of silver and gelatin, respectively. The coating composition for surface protective layer prepared in process 4 was further applied on both sides on the support in such a manner that the applied amount on each side reached 1.16 g m² in terms of amount of gelatin. Thus, the total amount of gelatin applied on each side was 2.79 g m². After being stored at a temperature of 25 C and a humidity of 65 RH for 7 days, these specimens were exposed to a blue light having a wavelength range of 360 to 480 nm with its peak intensity centered at 414 nm through a continuous wedges. The specimens thus light exposed were then developed with the developer shown hereinbefore at a temperature of 31 C for 25 seconss. Although the standard development temperature of 35 C, the above temeprature was used ot observe the developability at a low temperature. The specimens thus treated were then fixed with the fixing solution shown hereinbefore, washed with water and dried. The specimens of photographic material thus treated were measured for sensitometry. The results are shownin Table 3. In Table 3, the value of sensitivity was detremined in the same manner as in Exmaple 1. The development factor in Table 3 was detremined as follows The photographic material was subjected to exposure sufficient to provide Dmax, developed with the above developer at a temperature of 31 C, fixed with the above fixing agent, washed with water, and then dried. The development factor was calculated by dividing the amount of developed silver on the specimen by the applied amount of silver and then multiplying the quotient by 100. The sensitivity change S between 37 C development and 31 C development in Table 3 S The specimens which and been developed at temperatures of 37 C and 31 C, respectively, for 25 seconds were measured for sensitometry. The sensitivity change S was detremined as the difference of the common logarithms of the reciprocal of the exposure required to provide a transmission light density of fogg 2.0 on the respective characteristic curves. Teh haze was evaluated and represented as follows The specimens were directly developed and fixed at a temperature of 35 C, washed with water, and allowed to dry. These specimens were then measured for the percentage of scattered light to the gross transmitted light. The evaluation was made by clasisfying the vlaues thus obtained into the following five categories. Finally, the adhesion test upon wetting peel test and its evaluation were conducted as follows In the steps of development, fixing, and water washing, the photogrpahic emulsion side of the film was scratched with an iron stylus in such a amnner that two intersencting lines were marked thereon. These scratches were then rubbed with a finger tip. The evaluation was made as follows. A means no peeling of emulsion layer is observed except for the scratches. B means the maximum peel wideth regardless of the position of peeled layer, i.e., whether it is between the surface protective layer and the emulsion layer, or between the mulsion layer and support layer is within 5 mm. C means the maximum peel width is more than 5 mm. As can be seen in Table 3, the addition of polyacrylamide or polyacrylamide and dextran can improve the relative sensitivity, development factor, and development temperature dependency of sensitivity with little or no deterioration of the haze and wet adhesivity. The same surface photosensitive silver halide emulsion as preapared in Example 1 was used. However, the preparation of the internally fogged particle emulsion was conducted as follows Particles were fomed in such a manner that the sensitivity thereof reached 1 100 or less of that of the emulsion of Example 1 by the process described in U.S. Patent No. 2,592,250. The particles were then internally fogged by light. The praticles thus fogged were allowed to adsorb the mercapto compound B 1 of Example 1 to obtain an internally fogged silver chlorobromide emulsion B 2 AgCℓ 9 mol having an average particle diamenter of 0.30 µm. 5 partis by weight of emulsion A as silver content and 1 part by weight as silver content of emulsion B 2 were mixed with each other. The same additives as used in Example 5 were added to the mixture thus obtained except that the molecular weight of polyacrylamide was 9,000 to obtain a coating composition. A coating composition was prepared in the same manner as used in Exampler 5 except that the molecular weight of polyacrylamide was 9,000, and that polyoxyethylenic surface active agent I 3 was used. These processes were conducted in the same manner as used in Example 5. The results are shown in Table 4. A sepcimen was prepared in the same manner as used in specimen N. 7 of Exmaple 5 except in that the polyethylenic surface active agent II 10 was replaced by II 31, polyacrylamide Compound III 1 was replaced by polyacrylamide Compound III 13 The specimen thus preapred was measured for sensitomery. As in Specimen 7, excellent results were obtained. As apparent from the foregoing description, the present invention provides a silver halide photographic material which has improved sensitivity, development factor and development temperature dependency of sensitivity without deterioration of haze and wet adhesivity. While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and the scope thereof.
