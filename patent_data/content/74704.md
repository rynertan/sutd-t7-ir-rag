# Subsystem controller.

## Abstract
A dual processor, general purpose mini computer which is programmed as a front end data communications proces sor and is called a Network Support Processor. Data transfer commands received from a main host computer are ex ecuted and result messages are returned to the main host computer by the Network Support Processor. A base connec tion module providing slide in connector cards houses and supports circuit cards which make up the Network Support Processor. These cards include a master controller which includes a master processor card, a master memory control card and an Interface Card which connects to a main host computer and to one or more line communications proces sors, each of which may handle up to 16 data communica tions lines. A slave controller likewise includes a slave processor circuit card, and a slave memory control circuit card. A series of slide in memory cards forming a shared memory storage means connect to both the master and the slave memory control circuit cards.
