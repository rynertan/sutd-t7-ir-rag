# NOVEL LAYERED CLAYS, PROCESS FOR THEIR PRODUCTION AND USES THEREOF

## Abstract
The invention provides a silanised layered clay comprising a layered clay chemically modified by incorporation therein of a silicon containing residue in the absence of a polymeric cati onic hydroxy inorganic metal complex. The silanised layered clays are produced by hydrolysing a hydrolysable silicon com pound, for example a tetraalkoxysilane, in the presence of the layered clay and in the absence of a polymeric cationic hydroxy inorganic metal complex. The resulting silanised layered clays are more thermally and or hydrothermally stable than the lay ered clays from which they are derived.
