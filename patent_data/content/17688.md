# Monolithic integrated circuit.

## Abstract
A quiet column decoder is provided which is useful in semiconductor memory systems. The quiet column de coder prevents glitches from being coupled into the silicon substrate during the period of time that the sense ampli fiers 19 are sensing data on the bit sense lines 17, 18 . The quiet column decoder has double clocked NOR gates 25 which allows the address lines 13 to be continuous nonmultiplexed lines. The double clocked NOR gate 25 has two transistors 26, 33 for precharging a first 27 and a second 34 node within the NOR gate. Another transistor 37 is coupled between the second node 34 and a voltage reference terminal 36 to serve as an en abling device for the NOR gate 25 . The first node of the NOR gate serves as an output for the column decoder.
