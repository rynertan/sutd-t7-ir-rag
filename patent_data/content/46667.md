## Description
APPARATUS FOR BLENDING BATCHES OF DRY MATERIAL This invention relates to an apparatus for blending dry material and, more particularly, it pertains to blending apparatus for mixing batches of dry material into a homogeneous mixture. The mixing or blending of two or more dry materials is can involved operation to perform and to control. Though.mixing of such materials can be performed continuously, it is usually done in batches or lots. Inasmuch as the art of mixing or blending is empirical and because of the infinite variety of substances to be mixed, the number of mixing devices which have been developed is considerable. Indeed, the chemical and physical characteristics of the materials to be mixed are a primary consideration and influence the equipment to be used. Accordingly, each industry has developed mixing equipment adapted to its own use. Accordingly, the present invention resides in an apparatus for blending a plurality of batches of a dry material, characterized in that such apparatus comprises mixing means for commingling a plurality of batches of dry material and including a plurality of material receiving receptacles and a blender the receptacles being mounted for movement between loading and unloading stations and each receptacle being adapted to receive measured quantities of a dry material from a number of batches of dry material and the blender being rotatably mounted for mixing dry material received from the receptacles. The advantage of the device of this invention is that it provides a blend of several successive batches of dry material into a nearly homogeneous mixture. In order that the invention can be more clearly understood, a convenient embodiment thereof will now be described way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing in which Figure 1 is an elevational view of a blending apparatus of this invention Fig. 2 is a plan view of the apparatus shown inFig. 1 Fig. 3 is a vertical sectional view taken on the line Ill Ill of Fig. 1 Fig. 4 is a vertical sectional view taken on the line IV IV of Fig. 1 Fig. 5 is an enlarged fragmentary plan view of the rotatable conveyor of this apparatus Fig. 6 is a vertical sectional view taken on the line VI VI of Fig. 5 and Fig. 7 is an enlarged vertical sectional view taken on the line VII VII of Fig. 5. Referring to Figure 1, an apparatus for blending dry materials into a homogeneous mixture is generally indicated at 9 and comprises a rotatable receptacle generally indicated at 11, a mixer or blender 13, an accumulator 15, and a container 17 for the blended product.Although the apparatus 9 may be employed for mixing a va riety of types of dry material, it is particularly adapted for mixing chunks of metal, such as zirconium commonly called zirconium sponge , having an irregular configuration of varying dimensions ranging from less than 20 mesh up to about 3 4 inch. The rotatable receptacle 11 is comprised of a plurality, such as 48, vertical tubular receptacles 19 disposed in a circle and mounted on a circular base 21. The upper ends of the receptacles 19 are open and the lower ends are closed by releasable gates 23. Generally, the material flow commences with the dumping of a barrel 25 of a batch of material which is raised by a hoist 27 from a floor 29 to the upper dumping position, where the material flows through a spout 31 into a feed hopper 33 from where it drops onto a rotatable plate 35 at the lower end of a shaft 37 driven by a motor 39. Major amounts of the material from the barrel 25 are poured into the receptacles 19 through a conduit 41 so that with successive batches of material from a plurality of barrels 25, the receptacles are filled with a plurality of stratums of batches of dry material. The material is poured from the receptacles at unloading stations which are equally spaced from each other and comprised of a pair of dumping spouts or conduits 43, 45. Although two spouts 43, 45 are shown, it is understood that more than two spouts may be provided where desirable. The lower ends of the spouts 43, 45 converge at a collector 47 from where the material drops into the mixer 13 which is a double cone type mixer for rapid blending of the solid dry material. From the mixer 13, the material is poured into a barrel 51 from where it is moved laterally to a position 51a at the lower end of the hoist 27 by which it is then elevated to the position of the barrel 25 for re dumping into the hopper 33. As the material drops from the hopper, it passes through the conduit 41 which is relocated to the position 41a where it drops onto a shaker screen 53 within a container 55 for the removal of smaller particles of the material having a size of minus 20 mesh which is discarded, because of its high content of undesirable elements, such as nickel, iron, aluminum, etc. From the shaker screen, the material moves onto a cleated conveyor belt 57 by which it is elevated to a collector 59 where a magnetic device 61 is located for the removal of any possible iron contained in the material. From the collector 59, the material drops into a pair of spaced spouts 63, 65 for dropping into the accumulator 15.The accumulator 15 is a hopper type container which is divided by a wall 67 into two half portions to which the respective spouts 63, 65 are directed. At the lower end of the accumulator 15, the material flows through an outlet 69, controlled by a gate 71 from where controlled amounts of the material drop upon a table 73 for inspection and hand picking of foreign or discolored material, such as compounds of nitrogen and oxygen. The material which passes inspection drops through spouts 75 to a conduit 77 from where it drops into the container 17. A sample collector 79 may be used at the lower end of the conduit 77 for collecting samples.Inasmuch as zirconium sponge is a pyrophoric material capable of igniting spontaneously when exposed to air under confined conditions, the accumulator 15 which is a sealed tank is filled with argon or helium for reducing fire hazards. Other noble gases, such as neon and krypton, have been found to be less effective as fire inhibitors, if at all, than helium and argon. The product of dry material in the hopper is substantially completely blended from a plurality of batches of dry material delivered at the feed hopper 33.Moreover, where it is deemed necessary, the blended product from the container 17 may be recirculated through part or all of the foregoing apparatus as set forth above. The rotatable receptacle 11 Figs. 5, 6 and 7 comprises a circular plate 81 on which the tubular receptacles 19 are mounted by means of mounting brackets 83 and mounting flanges 85 extending from the outer periphery of the circular plate 81. An inverted rail 87 is mounted on the undersurface of the plate 81 and is supported on a plurality of peripherally spaced idler wheels 89 Fig. 7 which in turn are mounted on wheel shafts 91 in similar bearings 93 on support channels 95. By inverting the rail 87 for support on the spaced idler wheels 89, any powdered dry material falling from the spout 41 as it is poured into the tubular receptacles 19, lands upon a smaller surface portion of the idler wheel 89, rather than upon a larger surface of the rail 87, whereby a minimum amount of powdered material is entrapped between the wheels and the rail. Drive means for rotating the receptacle 11 is generally indicated at 97 and it comprises a prime mover 99, such as an electric motor, together with a drive chain 101 for turning a gear 103 which engages a roller chain 105 which is fixedly mounted on a mounting plate 107 on the inner periphery of the circular plate 81. As the receptacle 11 rotates, an indexing means 109 stops each receptacle 19 in alignment with the spout 41 Fig. 1 , whereby dry material is poured into each receptacle 19.With continued pouring into successive receptacles 19, additional batches of dry material from similar barrels 25 are poured into the receptacles until the receptacles are filled with layers or strata of dry material or zirconium sponge from successive barrels. Unloading of the receptacles 19 is accomplished by positioning one or more, such as two, receptacles 19 over the upper open ends of the spouts 43, 45 Figs. 6, 7 . As set forth above, each conduit includes a gate 23 Fig. 7 which is pivotally mounted at 111 and is provided with an inclined arm 113. A lever 115, pivotally mounted at 117, cooperates with the arm 113 for retaining the gate 23 in place when the receptacle is loaded with dry material 119. The weight of the material 119 urges the arm 119 in a clockwise direction about the pivot 111 where it is retained in place against a surface 121 of the lever 115. Release means, such as a solenoid 123, having a plunger 125 is actuated against a lower end 127 of the lever 115 to release the arm 113 from the surface 121, whereupon the gate 23 drops to empty the dry material 119 into an opening 129 in the base 21 which opening communicates with the upper end of the spout 43.When all of the material 119 has dropped from the retainer 19, the weight of the arm 113 causes the gate 23 to return counterclockwise to the closed position, whereupon the retracted plunger 125 enables the lever 115 to return to the blocked position as shown Fig. 7 . For more efficient blending of dry material 119, both spouts 43, 45 deliver material to the collector 47 Fig. 1 where under control of a gate 131, the material is dropped into the mixer 13. The mixer 13 is a tumbling type of mixer and, more particularly, of the double cone type having a central cylindrical portion and a coneshaped end portion at each end thereof. The mixer 13 is mounted on trunions on a horizontal axis, end over end, so that during rotation, the lower cone is tilted to a position where an angle of repose of the contents is exceeded and causes the contents to drop to the opposite cone end of the mixer, etc. After mixing, the contents are emptied into the barrel 51. The barrel 51 is then moved to the barrel position 51a where it is lifted on the hoist 27 to the upper end and poured into the hopper 33 from where it may be either recycled through the rotatable receptacle 11 or through the shaker screen 53. Thereafter the material flows, as set forth above, to the accumulator 15 and then to the container 17. Accordingly, the apparatus of this invention provides for the blending of batches, lots, or runs of dry material to provide as nearly a homogeneous mixture as possible.
