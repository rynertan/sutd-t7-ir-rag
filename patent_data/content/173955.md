# A method and device for detecting a specific acoustic spectral feature.

## Abstract
A method and device for detecting a narrow acoustic spectral feature in a sample as described. The method uses an electrical frequency modulated FM signal that is obtained from a voltage controlled oscillator 58. The Fourier spectrum of this wave is a main frequency f
