# Method of making a laminated sheet material.

## Abstract
Sheet products are made from amino aldehyde, e.g. urea formaldehyde, resin fibres in admixture with other non cellulosic fibres, e.g. glass fibres, and optionally cellulosic fibres. Multiply products may be made from plies having the above constitution and plies of, for example, amino aldehyde resin fibres, alone or in ad mixture with cellulosic and or non cellulosic fibres. The paper like sheet materials may be used e.g. as filter papers. Laminated products may be made by pressing, at an elevated temperature, a stack of plies of paper made from a mixture of amino aldehyde resin fibres and an other fibrous material, e.g. cellulosic fibres.
