# Container filler.

## Abstract
A device for filling a container 11 through a spout 13 extending from the container includes a sterile chamber 21 having a wall opening 27 therethrough for inserting the spout 13 into the chamber 21 . A cover 51 inside the chamber 21 is positioned over a base plate 23 which encloses the wall opening 27 to prevent the escape of sterile gas from the chamber 21 when the spout 13 is being inserted into and removed from the wall opening. A pair of jaws 31 fit around the spout 13 when the spout is in the opening to hold the spout in position for filling and to prevent contamination of the sterile chamber 21 during the filling operation.
