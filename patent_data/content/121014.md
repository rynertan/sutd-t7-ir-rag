## Description
RUNNER MEANS, PARTICULARLY CURTAIN RUNNERSThis invention relates to runner means and more particularly to curtain runners and the like.According to the invention runner means comprises hanger means a bearing integrally formed with the hanger means roller means or the like removably mountable on the bearing for rotation thereon and retaining means adapted releasably to retain the roller means on the bearing.For the purposes of this specification the term roller means includes wheel means or the like.The retaining means may be integrally formed with the roller means.Preferably, the retaining means is integrally formed with the bearing means and the hanger means.With the arrangement according to the invention, the runner means may comprise only two separate parts which are adapted to be assembled in releasable manner. This facilitates and or simplifies production and assembly and reduces costs.The retaining means may be integrally formed with the bearing and the hanger means and may comprise an elongate element which extends axially relative to the bearing and which is displaceable transversely between a normal operative position in which it is engageable with a co operating formation on the roller means to retain the roller means in rotatable relationship on the bearing and an inoperative position in which it permits the roller means to be mounted on and be withdrawn from the bearing. The elongate retaining element may be resiliently biassed towards its normal operative position when it is displaced away from the normal operative position.The bearing may comprise a tubular formation which is fast towards one end thereof with the hangermeans, the elongate retaining element being fast with the hanger means in the region of the one end of the tubular formation and extending axially along the tubular formation within the bore thereof.The elongate retaining element may be mounted in canti lever fashion and may include a transversely projecting catch formation towards its free end.The roller means may comprise a sleeve like body adapted rotatably to embrace the tubular formation of the bearing, the sleeve like body including a formation adapted to co operate with the elongate retaining element so as rotatably to retain the roller means on the tubular formation when the elongate retaining element is in its normal operative position.The co operating formation on the sleeve like body may comprise a transverse wall across the sleeve like body with an aperture therein through which the elongate retaining element may extend, the retaining element including a transversely projecting catch formation at its outer end adapted to engage the surround of the aperture in the transverse wall.The roller means may present any suitable outer peripheral configuration to suit a rail or other guide track on which the runner is to be mounted. The hanger means may be of any suitable configuration to permit a curtain or the like to be suspended directly or indirectly therefrom.The hanger means may comprise a hook formation adapted to engage a curtain or a part thereon.Alternatively, the hanger means may comprise an annular oloop like formation in which a hook or the like on a curtain may engage.The parts of runner means according to the invention may be made from any suitable material, such as a synthetic polymer material.For a clear understanding of the invention a preferred embodiment will now be described purely by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a sectional view on the line I I in figure 2, of a curtain runner according to the invention.Figure 2 is a rear elevational view of the curtain runner of figure in the direction of arrow M in figure 1.Figure 3 is a sectional view similar to figure 1 of another embodiment of a curtain runner according to the invention.The runner comprises a first unit A including hanger means 1 which includes a loop formation 2 engageable by a hook on a curtain and a connecting part 3 which is integrally formed with loop formation 2. First unit A further comprises bearing 4 which is in the nature of a tubular formation which is integrally formed at its one end with the connecting part 3 of hanger means l and is open at its other end.First unit A also comprises elongate retaining element 5 which is integrally connected with connecting part 3 of hanger means 1 and with bearing 4 in the region in which bearing 4 is integrally connected with connecting part 3. Retaining element 5 extends axially along bearing 4 within the bore thereof. It will be seen that retaining element 5 is mounted in cantilever fashion and that its free end projects from the open end of bearing 4. A head 6 presenting a transversely projecting catch formation 6a is integrally formed with retaining element 5 at its free end.Loop formation 2 and connecting part 3 of hanger means 1, bearing 4, retaining element 5 and its head 6 together with its catch formation 6a are all integrally formed as a single unit A from a suitable synthetic polymer material.The runner further comprises a second unit B comprising a roller unit including sleeve like body 7 which is open at its one end and is adapted to be removably mountable on bearing 4 with body 7 rotatably embracing bearing 4 transverse end wall 8 which is integrally formed with and extends across the outer end of body 7 and which is provided with a central aperture 9 through which the free end of retaining element 5 and the head 6 thereon can project with catch formation 6a located outwardly of transverse wall 8 and annular guide formation 10 which is integrally formed with body 7 and is adapted to engage and run along a suitable guide rail or other guide track not shown . Body 7, end wall 8 and guide formation 10 are all integrally formed as a single unit B from a suitable synthetic polymer material.Retaining element 5 is normally located in the operative position shown in figure 1 in which head 6 is off centre with respect to aperture 9 and catch formation 6a is engageable with the surrounds of aperture 91 in transverse wall 8 of roller unit B so that catch formation 6a and the surrounds of aperture 9 co operate to retain roller unit B rotatably mounted on bearing 4. The diameter of head 6 is smaller than the diameter of aperturie 9. The resilience of the material of retaining element 5 permits the retaining element 5 to be displaced transversely in the direction of arrowX against the action of an inherent resilient bias in retaining element 5, to an inoperative position in which head 6 is aligned with aperture 9 to permit roller unit B to be withdrawn axially from bearing 4. It ,will be appreciated that the runner only comprises two separate parts, namely the units A and B. The two units may be produced separately and then assembled.The particular construction and arrangement of parts facilitate the assembly of the two units.It will be seen that the outer end of head 6 on retaining element 5 is tapered and that the bore of aperture 9 has an outwardly converging configuration to define a slanting inner peripheral surface 9a. To assemble the two units A and B, the open end of body 7 of roller unit B is simply pushed over bearing 4 in the direction of ,arrow Y until the tapered head 6 of retaining element 5 engages the slanting inner peripheral surface 9a in the bore of aperture 9 in end wall 8 of roller unit B. By pushing roller unit B further in the direction of arrow Y, the engagement between tapered head 6 and slanting surface 9a displaces retaining element 5 transversely in the direction of arrow X from its normal operative position towards an inoperative position, until head 6 is aligned with aperture 9 and passes through the aperture.Once head 6 has passed through aperture 9, the inherent resilient bias developed in retaining element 5 during the transverse displacement thereof, exerts itself to urge retaining element 5 back to its normal position shown in figure l in which catch formation 6a is engageable with the surrounds of aperture 9 and rotatably retains roller unit B on bearing 4.It will be appreciated that instead of an elongate retaining element 5 which is integrally formed with bearing hanger unit A as shown in figures 1 and 2, the retaining means may be integrally formed with the roller unit B and may comprise an elongate elementwhich extends axially relative to the roller unit B and which is displaceable transversely between a normal operative position in which it is engageable with a co operating formation fast with the bearing 4 to retain the roller unit B in rotatable relationship on the bearing 4 and an inoperative position in which it permits the roller unit B to be mounted on and be withdrawn from the bearing 4. Any suitable co operating formation, such as an apertured transverse wall formation, may be provided on the hanger bearing unit A.Thus, the arrangement of the elongate retaining element 5 and the co operating transverse wall 8 shown in figures 1 and 2 may be reversed. Such an arrangement is shown in figure 3 in which the elongate retaining element 5 is integrally connected with the roller unitB in the region of the outer end of the sleeve like body 7. The retaining element 5 on roller unit B extends in cantilever fashion axially along sleeve like body 7 of roller unit B within the bore thereof from the outer end of body 7 towards the inner open end of body 7 in a position permitting the retaining element 5 to be located within the bore of the tubular bearing 4.The elongate retaining element 5 on roller unit B is adapted for the transversely projecting catch formation 6a at its outer free end to be releasably engageable with a co operating formation on the bearing hanger unit A in order releasably to retain roller unit B in rotatable relationship on bearing 4.As shown in figure 3 the co operating formation on bearing hanger unit A comprises apertured, transverse wall 8 across tubular bearing 4 which is integrally formed with connecting part 3 and with bearing 4 in theRegion of the inner end of bearing 4 where bearing 4is integrally connected with connecting part 3.Transverse wall 8 is provided with a central aperture 9 through which the outer free end of retaining element 5 can project, aperture 9 having a converging bore configuration to define slanting inner peripheral surface 9a.The retaining element 5 on the roller unit B can extend through central aperture 9 in the transverse wall 8 on the hanger bearing unit A, the transversely projecting catch formation 6a at the outer free end of retaining element 5 being adapted to engage the surround of aperture 9 in transverse wall 8 to retain the roller unit B in rotatable relationship on bearing 4 when retaining element 5 is in its operative position shown in figure 3. Retaining element S is displaceable transversely in the direction of arrow X towards an inoperative position to permit the roller unit B to be mounted on and be withdrawn from bearing 4, retaining element 5 being resiliently biassed towards its normal operative position when it is displaced away from its normal operative position.The operation of the retaining element 5 on roller unit B and its co operating apertured transverse wall 8 on bearing hanger unit A is similar to that described above with reference to the arrangement of figures l and 2. It will be appreciated that many other variations in detail are possible without departing from the scope of the appended claims. For example, instead of hanger means 1 presenting a loop formation 2, it may present a hook formation adapted to engage a curtain or a part thereon. Hanger means 1 may be of any suitable shape or configuration to suit particular requirements.Also, instead of roller unit B having a guide formation 10, the roller unit B may present any other suitable outer peripheral configuration to suit a rail or other guide track on which the curtain runner is to be mounted.The invention includesAwi thin its scope an integrally formed hanger bearing unit as defined above as well as roller means as defined above.Runner means according to the invention is particularly, but not exclusively, applicable to curtains.
