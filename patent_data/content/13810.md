# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF FUSECORD

## Abstract
A method and apparatus is provided for the manufacture of dry spun explosive fusecord, the method comprising contin uously advancing a carrier tape in a horizontal linear parth, partially convoluting the tape to form a longitudinal open trough portion extending over a feed zone of said path, contin uously feeding a stream of explosive material into the trough portion at a controlled rate appropriate to the formation of the desired explosive core, said stream being elongated and extending longitudinally over a portion of said feed zone, fur ther convoluting the loaded tape to form a closed tube sur rounding the explosive core and subsequently applying rein forcing materials around the closed tube. The carrier tape is preferably convoluted by carrying it through guides whilst the tape is supported on an auxiliary transport tape of stronger material. Helically spun layers of textile reinforcing material are advantageously applied from supply reels mounted in line co axially with the path of the carrier tape, the fusecord pas sing through the centre of each textile supply reel. The method permits higher production rates and more uniform loading of the explosive core of the fusecord.
