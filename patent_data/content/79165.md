# METH acrylic acid itaconic acid copolymers, their preparation and use as antiscalants.

## Abstract
Substantially homogeneous meth acrylic acid itaconic acid copolymers of number average molecular weight of 500 to 7000 are prepared by copolymerizing in aqueous solution 5 to 90 mole percent acrylic or methacrylic acid monomer with 95 to 10 mole percent itaconic acid monomer at 80 to 120 C in the presence of a polymerization initiator, the acrylic or methacrylic acid monomer and at least half of the initiator being added separately and continuously to the itaconic acid monomer throughout the polymerization period. The copoly mers are employed at a level of from about 0.1 to 100 ppm for prevention of alkaline calcium and magnesium scale formation, such as during seawater evaporative desalina tion.
