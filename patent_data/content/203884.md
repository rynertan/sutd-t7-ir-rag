# Dimensionally stable anode for molten salt electrowinning and method of electrolysis.

## Abstract
The morphology of a coating of Ce oxyfluoride on a con ductive substrate is improved by addition of yttrium, lantha num, praseodymium and or other rare earth metals. Whereas the pure Ce oxycompound coating shows cracks which frequently extend throughout the entire thickness of the coating, thus exposing finite portions of the substrate to eventual corrosive attack from the environment, the im proved coating including the above doping element s com prises a substantially impervious structure. Coatings of this nature may be employed with non consumable anodes in molten aluminum electrowinning cells or as chemical sen sors, corrosion protection and other applications.
