# Rhodium catalyzed oxidation and hydroformylation oxidation process for producing carboxylic acids.

## Abstract
A one step process for forming a carboxylic acid and its anhydride directly from the corresponding olefin which com prises reacting the olefin with carbon monoxide, hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of a rhodium complex catalyst stabi lized by a pentavalent Group V ligand, such as a phosphine ox ide. Alternatively a carboxylic acid can be produced by oxida tion of an aldehyde in the presence of a rhodium complex cata lyst stabilized by said pentavalent Group V ligand.
