# Automated feed for a punch press and method of using same.

## Abstract
A stack of strips of feed stock are placed on an adjustable height table. The strips are positioned on the table by arms which align the stack to the centerline of punching dies in a punch press. A pneumatic actuated head uses vacuum cups to raise the end of the top strip and insert it into in feed rolls. The drive means for the in feed rolls also drive an encoder which signals roll movement as the rolls incrementally feed the stock into the punch press. Drive means for the feed stock switches to the out feed rolls once the blanked out stock reaches those rolls, and when the end of the strip passes through the punch press, a control unit is signaled and a new strip is fed into the system.

## Description
In operations where feed stock is automatically fed to a punch press the feed stock normally uses a coil of material. No provisions are found for automatically feeding consecutive strips of various widths and thicknesses as no provisions are found for automatically recognizing the beginning and ending of short strips of feed stock.It was found that automatic means could not only handle coils of feed stock but could also automatically use strips of feed stock. An adjustable height stack table for feed stock has adjustable arms along each side to align varying widths of feed stock to a punch press. A pick up head automatically raises the end of feed stock and inserts it into a set of feed rolls which advance a leading edge of the stock to a calibration position from which position the in feed rolls automatically advance the feed stock into blanking position in the punch press then incrementally advance the stock after each punching operation. Once the blanked out scrap stock reaches a set of feed rolls, those rolls take over and incrementally feed the press.Encoders on the rolls, in conjunction with computeroperated controls, sequence the operation. It is an object of this invention to automatically feed strips of feed stock. Figure 1 shows a side elevational view of this invention. Figures 2A and 2B show perspective views of the invention of Figure 1. Figure 3 shows a block diagram of the controls for this invention. An automated system 10 for processing the blanking of metal calls for a stack table 12, a pick up head 14, in feed rolls 16, a punch press 18, out feed rolls 20, a scrap chopper 22 and control unit 24. The table 12 is preferably of the scissors lift type to permit legs 26, which are each pivotally mounted at 28, to be acted upon by hydraulic cylinders 30 to raise and lower the table top 32. Strips of feed stock 34 are stacked on the table. This feed stock is aligned to the punch press 18 by a series of positioning arms 36 and backstop arms 38. The positioning arms locate the stack so that the centerline of each strip is located on the centerline of the press and the rest of the feed system. The positioning arms are driven by a small d.c. servo motor 40 through a drive line 42 and right angle gear boxes 44.A drive line 46 extends off of each gear box and laterally moves the upright positioning arms. The positioning arms press against and define the side location of the feed stock. An encoder 48 is also driven by the d.c. motor and emits a signal to provide feed back of positioning arm location. The back stop arms define the opposite side of the feed stock strips. Those arms are simultaneously actuated by pneumatic cylinders that first exert considerable pressure to ensure the feed stock is pressed against the positioning arms, then the pneumatic pressure is reduced to assure alignment while permitting longitudinal movement of the feed stock 34. These positioning and back up arms ensure alignment of the feed stock, whether it be strips of stock as shown here or whether it be coils of feed stock. The feed stock strips 34 are introduced one at a time into in feed rolls 16. Those rolls consist of a large driven roll 50 which is preferably covered with neoprene and a smaller clamping idler roll 52 which is preferably covered with polyethylene. The driven roll is actuated with a d.c. servo motor 54. An encoder 56 is coupled to the driven roll to provide roll position information as the roll rotates. The idler roll is raised and lowered by pneumatic cylinders 58. A pick up head 14 has a pneumatic cylinder 60 which moves a pair of vacuum cups 62 down against the leading edge of the top strip. A vacuum is initiated and the end of the strip raised. Cylinder 64 is actuated to move ahead with strip to insert the end of the stock strip into the in feed rolls. The vacuumfts turned off, releasing the feed stock, and the pick up head returned to starting position. The in feed rolls are then clamped together and the feed stock moved forward until the end of the feed strip interrupts an electric eye sensor consisting of a light source 66 located above the strip and just downstream from the in feed rolls and a photodetector 68 located below the strip.When the sensor is actuated it acts as a calibration position, sending a signal to the control unit 24 from which a computer sends a signal to the drive motor on the in feed roll to advance the feed stock from the calibration position to a position for blanking in the punch press. Once the press is actuated and the first part is blanked out, the computer sends a signal to the in feed rolls to advance the feed stock in increments suitable for the automatic blanking.Air lines 70 are located on the press to laterally blow out slugs as well as the blanked out parts. As the parts are punched out, the feed stock now becomes scrap stock and is directed between a set of out feed rolls consisting of a driven roll 72 which preferably has a knurled steel surface and a clamping idler roll 74 which is movable by pneumatic cylinders 76. A d.c. servo motor 78 drives the out feed roll and also drives an encoder 80 to signal movement of the driven roll. Once the scrap stock enters the out feed rolls, the feeding of the punch press is switched from the in feed where the idler roll is raised out of contact and the out feed rolls take over.The out feed rolls continue the incremental feeding until the end of the feed stock strip is reached at which time the press flywheel stops operation while a new cycle starts with another strip picked up by the pick up head, the feed stock advanced to the blanked out position, and the process is repeated. As the scrap stock leaves the out feed rolls it passes through a guillotine type chopper 82. That chopper is actuated by pneumatic cylinder 84 and is timed to activate each time the feed stock is halted for the punch cycle. The chopped up scrap stock is then collected in a container 86. During the processing of the parts, an oiler not shown lubricates the feed stock just ahead of the punch press. Just ahead of the out feed rolls is a knurled steel indexing roll 88 which is swung into position in forced contact with the scrap stock with a pneumatic cylinder 90. Movement of the indexing roll drives a shaft encoder 92 which provides an actual strip movement signal to the control unit. This movement is compared with outfeed roll movement as shown by encoder 80 to be certain the scrap stock is not slipping as it passes through the out feed rolls. If the stock is slipping, the unit is automatically shut down until the situation is corrected. The control unit 24, as best shown in Figure 3, consists of a control panel 94, a computer 96, and an interface 98. The operator inputs his commands to switches on the control panel. The commands are passed through the interface directly to the computer which in turn sends signals through the interface to the appropriate parts of the machine. Machine sensors 100 communicate to the computer items such as position of machine actuators, position of the crank shaft and error conditions. The machine actuators 102 are the type of devices that have only two positions. They are activated by the computer through the interface.On the other hand, the three servo systems of the in feed rolls, out feed rolls and the positioning arms are closed loop through the computer so that the computer determines where one of those units should be compared to actual position and if there is an error sends a correction signal to the servo unit. The amplifiers 104 for the in feed roll, 106 for the out feed roll and 108 for the positioning arms accept low level signals from the computer through the interface and amplify the signal to drive the appropriate servo motors. In operation, a stack of strips of feed stock 34 is placed on the table 12. Signals are punched into the control panel setting forth the width of stock, the length between the calibration line and the blanking position, the incremental length of feed stock between blanking positions and the number of blanked parts required. The table rises to a position where the pick up head 14 can reach the top strip feed stock 34. The positioning arms move to the width set to properly align the stock. The back up arms 38 press the stack against . the positioning arms. The pick up head 14 picks up the leading edge of the top strip of feed stock and inserts it in the in feed rolls 16. The idler roll 52 moves down to press the feed stock against driven feed roll 50 and the stock is fed into the press. As the end of the feed stock interrupts the light from light source 66, it establishes the calibration point and determines the additional travel of the feed stock to get into blanking position. The calibration point also establishes the reference point for the incremental advance of the feed stock during blanking. The feed stock which becomes scrap stock after the blanking takes place is pushed into the out feed rolls 20. Once the scrap stock or skeleton reaches those rolls, the idler roll 74 moves down pressing the stock against the out feed drive roll 72 and those rolls take over the feeding of the press. At the same time idler roll 52 moves away from driven in feed roll 50 and indexing roll 88 moves against the scrap stock to measure slippage. The scrap stock is then advanced into the chopper 82.
