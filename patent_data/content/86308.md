## Description
COATS COMPOSITIONS MB POLYHYDROXY 0LIGo PRECURSORS TER7a FOR This invention relates to novel coating compositions and polyhydroxy oligomers therefor. Because of increasingly strict solvent emissions regulations in recent years, low solvent emission paints have become very desirable. A number of high solids paint compositions have been proposed to meet these low solvent emission requirements.However, may of these compositions are deficient because of difficulty in application, slow curing rates, lack of flexibility, poor durability and low solvent and water resistance. According to the present invention, there is provided a coating compositions comprising A A polyhydroxy oligomer having a number average kin molecular weight of between about 250 2000 and being the reaction product of i an ester having pendant hydroxyl and carboxyl functionality and being mauve by reacting a a C3 C1O aliphatic branched diol, and b an alkyl hexahydrophthalic anhydride, wherein a and b are combined in the reaction mixture in an amount sufficient to allow reaction in about a 1 1 molar ratio, and ii a C2 C10 monomer having a reactive functionality capable of esterifying the carboxyl functionality of the ester.This C2 C10 monomer adds hydroxyl functionality either directly or indirectly to the reaction product and is selected from the group consisting of a a monomer wherein said reactive functionality reacts with said carboxyl functionality to form an hydroxyl in addition to an ester linkage, b a monomer bearing hydroxyl functionality in addition to said reactive functionality and wherein said reactive functionality does not generate a hydroxyl in addition to an ester linkage, and c a monomer bearing hydroxyl functionality in addition to said reactive functionality and wherein said reactive functionality reacts with said carboxyl functionality to form a hydroxyl in addition to an ester linkage, wherein the ester and the C2 Cio monomers are in the reaction in about a 1 1 molar ratio B a cross linking agent, and C 0 50 weight percent based on the total weight of A , B and C of a hydroxyBunctional additive having a number average molecular weight in of from 150 to 6000, preferably from 500 to 2500. The cross linking agent may be an amino aldehyde or a polyisocyanate. The amine aldehyde cross linking agent is included in the composition in an amount sufficient to provide at least about 0.60, preferably from 0.75 to 3.75, equivalents of nitrogen crosslinging functionality for each equivalent of hydroxyl functionality included in the composition either on the polyhydroxy oligomer or as a hydroxyl group of the hydroxy functional additive. The polyisocyanate cross linking agent is included in the composition in an amount sufficient to provide from 0.50 to 1.6, preferably from 0.80 to 1.3 reactive isocyanate groups per hydroxyl groups included in the composition either on the oligomer or on the hydroxy functional additive. The oligomers of this composition are compatible, in particular, with low molecular weight hydroxy functional acrylics. In addition, the coating composition of this invention may include conventional additives such as catalysts, antioxidants,U.V. absorbers, flow control or wetting agents, antistatic agents, pigments, plaiticizers, solvents, etc. The oligomers of this composition are also compatible with nonaqueous dispersions NAD s , which are genrally used as flow control additives. The invention is also direction to the polyhydroxy oligomer A of the coating composition described above. The preferred oligomer is a dihydroxy oligomer produced by an ester monomer reaction which adds only one additional hydroxyl group to the oligomer i.e., the hydroxyl functionality is either present on the C2 C10 monomer initially or generated as a result of the monomer ester reaction . The preferred low viscosity high solids coating composition of this invention provide a system which is particularly suitable for those applications requiring a coating having good weatherability, high gloss, hardness, durability and high solvent and water resistance as well as low temperature cure. The desirable characteristics of the low viscosity coating composition of this invention, in particular the excellent physical properties and weatherability, are believed to result from the steric hinderance to hydrolysis afforded the ester groups of the oligomer by the alkyl group of the anhydride. However, while this theory has been advanced to explain the excellent durability of this coating composition, nether its validity nor its understanding is necessary for the practice of the invention. Each of the components of the oligomer and coating composition, the preferred amounts of each of the components required to achieve the desired results of the invention and a method for applying the composition are described hereinafter in greater detail. POLYKYDROW OLIGOMKRS A principal material in the coating of this invention is a novel polyhydroxy oligomer having a number average Mn molecular weight between about 250 and about 2000, more preferably between about 400 and about 1500. The oligomer is prepared by first combining a low molecular weight C3 C10 aliphatic branched diol with an alkyl hexahydrophthatic anhydride in a reactant mixture in an amount sufficient to allow reaction in about a 1 1 molar ratio so as to form an ester having pendant hydroxyl and carboxyl functionality. This ester is further reacted with aC2 C10 monomer bearing reactive functionality capable of esterifying the carboxyl functionality of the ester and forming the polyhydroxy oligomer, using suitable catalysts, if desired.The monomer is suitably chosen so that, in addition to the esterification of the carboxyl functionality by means of this reaction, pendant hydroxyl functionality is also incorporated on the oligomer, i.e., this hydroxyl functionality was either present initially on the monomer exclusive of the reactive functionality , as for example when reacting a diol monomer or generated by this reaction, as is the case, for example, when the monomer used is an epoxy, or both initially present and reaction generated as when the monomer contains both epoxide and hydroxyl functionality. The adduct and the monomer are combined in the reactant mixture in an amount sufficient to allow reaction in about a 1 1 molar ratio. The C3 C10 aliphatic branched diol used in preparing oligomers useful in compositions of this invention preferably contains only one primary hydroxyl group, the second hydroxyl of the diol is therefore preferably a secondary or tertiary hydroxyl, preferably a secondary hydroxyl. Additionally it is preferable that the hydroxyl groups not be on adjacent carbons and more preferably be separated by at least three carbon atoms. The carbon chain may also be interrupted or substituted by non interfering functionality. Suitable C3 C10 aliphatic branched diols include, but are not limited to, 2 ethyl 1,3 hexane diol, 1,3 butane diol, 1,2 butane diol and 1,2 propane diol, with 2 ethyl l,3 hexane diol being most preferred. The choice of other suitable diols would be within the skill of one in the art. Mixtures of suitable diols can also be used. The alkyl hexahydrophthalic anhydride preferably contains a lower alkyl group, i.e., an alkyl group having up to about seven carbon, more preferably up to about four carbons. Additionally, the alkyl group may be substituted by non interfering functionality. Suitable anhydrides useful in this invention include methyl hexahydrophthalic anhydride, and its ethyl and propyl analogs, with methyl hexahydrophthalic anhydride being most preferred. Suitable C2 C10 monomers useful in this invention include, but are not limited to, branched diols, such as those described above, monoepoxides whose carbon chain may be interrupted by oxygen or contain non interfering functionality such as hydroxyl, and glycidyl ethers and glycidyl esters. Examples of these mondmers which may be used include alkylene oxides such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, 2,3 butylene oxide, and 1,2 epoxy decane, styrene oxide, cyclohexene oxide, butyl glycidyl ether, glycidol acetate, and glycidol.Since the preferred oligomer contains two hydroxyl groups, i.e., is a dihydroxy oligomer , the reaction of the hydroxy carboxy ester with the monomer preferably incorporates only one additional hydroxy functionality on the oligomer i.e., in addition to that already present on the hydroxy carboxy ester as a result of the branched diol anhydride reaction .Therefore, the preferred monomers are selected from diols, nonfunctional monoepoxides and glycidyl ethers and glycidyl esters wherein the glycidyl functionality is the only reactive functionalality in the case of monoepoxides, glycidyl ethers and glycidyl esters, i.e., containing no hydroxy functionality . As will be apparent to one skilled in the art, suitable mixtures of these monomers could also be used.In order to achieve the preferred high solids composition of the subject invention, it is preferable to use highly branched monomers, in particular branched diols, and most particularly 2 ethyl l, 3 hexane diol. In preparing the dihydroxy oligomers, the branched diol a and the anhydride b are combined and reacted at an elevated temperature and for a time necessary to form the hydroxy acid ester. Subsequently, the monomer ii is reacted with the ester generally in the presence of a catalyst, at an elevated temperature until the esterification of the carboxyl functionality of the ester is complete. In one embodiment of this invention, wherein the same diol is used as the branched diol a and the reactiveC2 C10 monomer ii , the diol can be combined with the anhydride in about a 2 1 molar ratio and the two stage reaction carried out. After the first reaction is complete, wherein the hydroxy acid ester is formed, a catalyst is generally added to initiate the esterification of the carboxyl of the hydroxy acid ester. The carboxyl functionality reacts with one of the hydroxyls of the diol to form an ester leaving the second hydroxyl intact. The water produced by this condensation reaction is removed.In another embodiment, wherein for example, the C2 C10 monomer is a monoepoxide, the branched diol a and the anhydride b are first combined and reacted in about a 1 1 molar ratio. Subsequently, the monoepoxide is added to the reaction product hydroxy carboxy ester to form the hydroxy oligomer. In this second reaction step, the carboxyl of the ester opens the epoxide ring and generate a hydroxyl group. Suitable catalyst for the esterification of the carboxyl functionality are well known in the art.Catalysts known to catalyze the carboxy epoxy reaction include tetralkyl ammonium salts such as tetra methyl ammonium chloride, tetraethyl ammonium bromide and trimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride as well as metal salts of a carboxylic acid, such as potassium octoate or chromiumIII octoate. Other useful catalysts include metal halides such as chromium trichloride, ferric trichloride, and aluminum trichloride mercaptans and thioethers such as octyl mercaptan, dimercapto propanol and dimercaptodiethyl ether tertiary amines such as triethyl amine, pyridine, dimethylandine, quinoline, B picoline, ethylpyridine and the like.Suitable catalysts useful for the carboxy hydroxy diol condensation reaction include such catalysts as terisopropyl titanate, strong acids such as p toluene sulfonic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and materials such as zinc oxide, antimony oxide Sb 0 and 23 sodium acetate. Other catalyst will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although the above reactions may be carried out with or without solvents, it is generally suitable and preferable, in order to achieve the preferred high solids level of the coating composition to use little or no solvent. However, when desirable, suitable solvents which may be employed include those commonly used, such as toluene, xylene, methyl amyl ketone, etc. Various mixtures of these types of oligomers may also be employed within the scope J the compositions of the invention described herein. CrossliDking Agent The second component of the coating compositions of this invention is a crosslinking agent. The crosslinking agent may be an amino aldehyde or a polyisocyanate. Amine aldehyde Crosslinking Agents Suitable amino aldehyde crosslinking agents are well known in the art. Typically, these crosslinking materials are products of reactions of melamine, or urea with formaldehyde and various alcohols containing up to and including 4 carbon atoms.Preferably, the amine aldehyde crosslinking agents useful in this invention are amine aldehyde resins such as condensation products of formaldehyde with melamine, substituted melamine, urea, benzoguanamine or substituted benzoguanamine. Preferred members of this class are methylated melamine formaladehyde resins such as hexamethoxymethylmelamine. These liquid cross linking agents have substantially 100 percent nonvolatile content as measured by the foil method at 450C. for 45 minutes.For the purposes of the preferred composition of the invention it should be recognized that it is important not to introduce extraneous diluents that would lower the final solids content of the coating. Other suitable amine aldehyde crosslinking agents would be apparent to one skilled in the art. Particularly preferred crosslinking agents are the amino crosslinking agents sold by American Cyanamid under the trademark Cymel. In particular, Cymel 301, Cymel 303, Cymel 325 and Cymel 1156, which are alkylated melamine formaldehyde resins are useful in the compositions of this invention. The crosslinking reactions are catalytically accelerated by acids. One such catalyst, for example, which may be so employed is p toluene sulfonic acid generally added to the composition in about .5 by weight based on the total weight of ester and crosslinking agent. The amine aldehyde materials function as a crosslinking agent in the composition of the invention by reacting with the hydroxyl functionality of the oligomer and by reaction with hydroxyl functionality on the hydroxy functional additive if such material is included in the composition. In order to achieve the outstanding properties which make these coating compositions particularly useful as automotive topcoat materials, it is essential that the amount of amino crosslinking agent be sufficient to substantially completely crosslink the hydroxyl functionality in the coating composition. Therefore, the amino crosslinking agent should be included in the composition in an amount sufficient to provide at least about o 60 equivalents, preferably between wbout 0.75 and about 3.75 equivalents, of nitrogen crosslinking functionality for each equivalent of hydroxyl functionality included in the composition either as a hydroxyl group on the optional hydroxy functional additive or on the polyhydroxy oligomer. Polyisocyanate Crosslinking Agent The alternative crosslinking agent comprises a polyisocyanate i.e., a compound having 2 or more, preferably 3 or more, reactive isocyanate groups per molecule. This polyisocyanate crosslinking agent is included in the compositions of the invention in an amount sufficient to provide between about .5 and about 1.6 preferably between about .8 and about 1.3, reactive isocyanate groups per hydroxy group in the composition. Most preferably the crosslinking agent is included in an amount sufficient to provide about 1.1 isocyanate groups per hydroxyl group in the composition. Polyisocycantes are well known in the art and numerous suitable isocyanates having 2 or more reactive isocyanate groups per molecule will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Among the many suitable polyisocyanates are aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic ioscyanate compounds. Representative of the numerous isocyanates which may be employed are 1 aliphatic diisocyanates such as trimethylene diisocyanate, tetramethylene diisocyanate, pentamethylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, 1,2 propylene diisocyanate, 1,2 butylene diisocyanate, 2,3 butylene diisocyanate, 1,3 butylene diisocyanate, ethylidene diisocyanate, butylidene diisocyanate, 4,4 bis isocyanate hexyl methane, bis 2 isocyanate ethyl fumarate, 2,6 diisocyanate methyl caproate, 2,2,4 2,4,4 trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate, and dimer acid diisocyanates 2 cycloaliphatic diisocyanates such as 1,3 cyclopentane diisocyanate, 1,4 cyclopentane diisocyanate, 1,2 cyclopentane diisocyanate, and methylcyclohexylene diisocyanate 3 aromatic diisocyanates such as m phenylene diisocyanate, p phenylene diisocyanate, 4,4 dishenyl diisocyanate, 1,5 methylene diisocyanate, 1,4 napthalene diisocyanate 4 aliphatic aromatic diisocyanates such as 4,4 diphenylenemethane diisocyanates, 2,4 or 2,6 toluene diisocyanate, 4,4 toluidene diisocyanate, 1,4 xylylene diisocyanate 5 nuclear substituted aromatic compounds such as dianisidine diisocyanate, 4,4 diphenylether diisocyanate, chlorodiphenylene diisocyanate 6 triisocyanates such as triphenylmethane 4,4 , 4,4 triisocyanate, 1,3,5 triisocyanate benzene, 2,4,6 triisocyanate toluene 7 tetraisocyanates such as 4,4 diphenyl dimethylmethane 2,2 , 5,5 titraisocyanate 8 polymerized isocyanates such as tolylene diisocyanate dimers and trimers and the like and 9 polyisocyanates such as prepolymt rs derived from a polyol, including polyether polyols or polyester polyols including polyethers which are reacted with excess polyisocyanates to form isocyanate termined prepolymers , simple polyols such as glycols e.g., ethylene glycol, propylene glycol , other polyols such as glycerol, trimethylol propane, hexane triol, pentaerythritol and the like, as well as monoethers, e.g. diethylene glycol, tripropylene glycol and the like and polyethers, i.e., alkylene oxide condensates of theabove. Especially preferred for use in the compositions of the invention are trimerized products of aliphatic diisocyanates such as 1,6 hexamethylene diisocyanate. Still another particularly preferred type of crosslinking agent is a polyisocyanate having a biuret structure. This type of polyisocyanate is well known as are methods for making the same. One such polyisocyanate crosslinking agent is a high molecular weight biuret of 1,6 hexamethylene diisocyanate sold by Mobay Chemical Company under the tradename Desmodur N. Examplary of other biutet type polyisocyanates are those prepared in accordance with d.S. Patent 3,976,622 to Wagner et al. Optional Hvdroxv Fanctional Additive Aaditional hydroxyl functionality other than that present on the polyhydroxy oligomer may be achieved by adding a hydroxy functional additive in amounts up to about 50 weight percent based on the total of the two above discussed components and the hydroxy functional additive itself. Such a material serves to provide additional hydroxy functional additives so as to provide a more intimate crosslinked structure in the final cured product.The hydroxy functional additives useful in the composition are preferably selected from various polyols having a number average molecular weight Mn of between about 150 and about 6000, preferably between about 400 and about 2500. As used herein the term polyol means a compound having two or more hydroxy groups. The polyols useful in the invention preferably are selected from the group consisting of i hydroxy functional polyesters ii hydroxy functional polyethers iii hydroxy functional oligoesters iv monomeric polyols v hydroxy functional copolymers produced by free redical polymerisation of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers, one of which bears hydroxy functionality and which is included in the copolymer in an amount ranging from about 10 to about 50 weight percent, and vi mixtures of i to v . U.S. Patent 4,181,784 to Chattha et al teaches a high solids paint composition comprising an optional hydroxy functional additive. This patent is hereby expressly incorporated by reference as detailing hydroxy functional additives representative of those which are suitable for use as such in the composition of this invention. These hydroxy functional materials include hydroxy functional polyesters, hydroxy functional polyethers, hydroxy functional oligomers, onomeric polyols and hydroxy bearing copolymers. The hydroxy functional polyesters useful in the invention are preferably fully saturated products prepared from aliphatic dibasic acids containing 2 20 carbon atoms, and short chain glycols of up to and including 21 carbon atoms. The molecular weight of these materials ranges from about 200 to about 2500 and the hydroxyl number ranges from about 30 to about 230. Among preferred polyesters are products derived from esterification of ethylene glycol and 1,4 butane diol with adipic acid, ethylene glycol and 1,2 propylene glycol with adipic acid, azelaic acid and sebacic acid copolyester diols and mixtures thereof. Among useful polyether diols are polytetramethylene ether glycol, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol and the like. The hydroxy functional oligoesters useful as hydroxy functional additives in the compositions of the invention are oligoesters preferably having a molecular weight of between about 150 and about 3000. Such oligoesters may be selected from the group consisting of i oligoesters prepared by reacting a dicarboxylic acid with a monoepoxide such as an alkylene oxide ii oligoesters prepared by reacting a polyepoxide with a monocarboxylic acid and iii oligoesters prepared by reacting a hydroxy functional monocarboxylic acid with either a mono or polyepoxide. Oligoester i is prepared by reacting a dibasic carboxylic acid with a monoepoxide, preferably include those formed by reacting C6 C12 dicarboxylic aliphatic acids with ethylene oxide or propylene oxide. The preparation of oligoesters from carboxylic acids and polyepoxides is well known and is described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,456,408 and 2,653,141.Numerous hydroxy functional oligoesters within this general category wil be apparent to those skilled in the art. The third type of hydroxy functional oligoester, i.e., those prepared by reaction of a hydroxy functional monocarboxylic acid with an epoxide is described in U.S. Patent 3,404,018.While the epoxides employed in accordance with the teachings of that patent are polyepoxides, oligoesters may be prepared in a similar manner to that described therein by employing a monoepoxide, such as an alkylene oxide, and a hydroxy functional monocarboxylic acid as described thin. Among the numerous monomeric polyols which may be employed as the hydroxy functional additive are the various short chain glycols of up to and including 21 carbon atoms which are useful in preparing the hydroxy functional polyesters discussed above. Other conventional polyhydric alcohols such as glycerols and sugar alcohols are also among the numerous monomeric polyols which will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The hydroxy bearing copolymer useful as the hydroxy functional additive may be formed from monoethylenically usaturated monomers, with between about 10 and about 50 weight percent bearing hydroxyl functionality. Although one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many different hydroxy bearing monomers could be employed, the preferred hydroxy functional monomers for use in the hydroxy functional resin of the invention are C5 C7 hydroxy alkyl acrylates and or Wo C8 hydroxy alkyl methacrylates, i.e., esters of C2 C3 dihydric alcohols and acrylic or methacrylic acids. The remainder of the monomers forming the hydroxy functional copolymer, ive t between about 90 and about 50 weight percent of the monomers of the copolymer, are other monoethylenically unsaturated monomers. These monoethylenically unsaturated monomers are preferably alpha beta olefinically unsaturated monomers, i.e., monomers bearing olefinic unsaturation between the two carbon atoms in the alpha and beta positions with respect to the terminus of an aliphatic carbon to carbon chain. Other Materials In addition to the above discussed components, other materials may be included in the coating compositions of the invention. These include materials such as catalysts, antioxidants, U.V. absorbers, solvents, surface modifiers and wetting agents as well as pigments.The solvents used in the coating compositions of the invention are those which are commonly used. Typical solvents useful in the coating compositions facilitate spray application at high solids content and include toluene, xylene, methyethyl ketone, acetone, 2 ethoxyl ethanol, 2 butoxyl l ethanol, diacetone alcohol, tetrahydrofuran, ethylacetate, dimethylsuccinate, dimethylglutarate, dimethyladipate or mixtures thereof.The solvent in which the polyhydroxy functional oligomer of the coating composition is prepared, may be employed as the solvent for the coating composition thus eliminating the need for drying the oligomer after preparation, if such is desired. As mentioned above, the nonvolatile solids content of the high solids coating composition is preferably at least 60 , and more preferably 70 or more, thus limiting the amount of solvent included in the composition. The subject paint composition may comprise 100 solids thereby including no solvent. However, while tne polyhydroxy oligomers of the subject invention are particularly suitable for making high solids coatings, they are also suitable for use in compositions that are not high solids compositions. Determination of optimal solids content for a given application would be within the skill of one in the art. Surface modifiers or wetting agents are common additives for liquid paint compositions. The exact mode of operation of these surface modifiers is not known, but it is thought that their presence contributes to better adhesion of the coating composition to the surface being coated and helps formation of thin coatings, particularly on metal surfaces. These surface modifiers are exemplified by acrylic polymers containing 0.1 10 percent by weight of a copolymerized monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids such as methacrylic acid, acrylic acid or itaconic acid, cellulose acetate butyrate, silicone oils or mixtures thereof. Of course, the choice of surface modifiers or wetting agent is dependent upon the type of surface to be coated and selection of the same is clearly within the skill of the artisan. The coating composition of the invention also may include pigments. As noted above, the coating compositions of this invention may include metallic flake as a pigment. The amount of pigment in the coating composition may vary, but preferably is between about 3 and about 45 weight percent based on the total weight of the paint composition. If the pigment is metallic flake, the amount ranges from about 1 to about 20 weight percent. For many applications of the coating compositions of the invention, particularly high solids compositions containing an amine aldehyde crosslinking agent, it may be desirable to employ fFw control additives to provide sag free coatings. Among numerous such materials, non aqueous dispersions NAD 5 such as described by Porter S.Porter, Jr. and B.N. McBane, U.S. Patent 4,025,474, May 24, 1977 are compatible with these oligomeric coating compositions. These particle dispersions may be included in an amount up to 25 by weight of the total composition. Other types of NAD s such as described by D.L.Maker and S.C. Peng U.S. Patent 3,814,721, June 4, 1974 also may be included in the paint composition. Application Techniques The coating composition can be applied by conventional methods known to those in the art. These methods include roller coating, spray coating, dipping or brushing and, of course, the particular application technique chosen will depend on the particular substrate to be coated and the environment in which the coating operation is to take place. A particularly preferred technique for applying the high solids coating compositions, particularly when applying the same to automobiles as topcoats, is spray coating through the nozzle of a spray gun. In accordance with tr is preferred technique, the polyhydroxy oligomer and the optional hydroxy functional copolymer along with other addtives such as pigments, U.V. absorbers, antioxidants and other nonreactive materials are admixed with solvent.These materials are fed as one component of a two component system into a spray gun which combines the materials as they are sprayed onto the automotive substrate. The other material is the polyisocyanate crosslinking agent, which may or may not be cut with aaiitable nonreactive solvent. High solids paints have in the past caused some difficulty in spray coating techniques because of high viscosity of the materials and resultant problems in clogging of spray guns.However, because the compositions of this invention demonstrate relatively low viscosity considering the high solids content they can be applied by spray coating techniques. The invention will be further understood by referring to the following detailed examples. It should be understood that the specific examples are presented by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. Unless otherwise specified, all references to parts1 is intended to mean parts by weight. Examples 1 to 11 illustrate the use ofanino aldehyde crosslinking agents. Examples 12 to 20 illustrate the use of a polyisocyanate crosslinking agent.
