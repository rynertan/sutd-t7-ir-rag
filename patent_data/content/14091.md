# Ceramic sensor element.

## Abstract
An improved sensor having a ceramic element that un dergoes a change in an electrical characteristic in response to a change in the partial pressure of oxygen in a mixture of gases to which the ceramic element is exposed. Sensors of this type are used to detect the air fuel ratio of mixtures supplied to in ternal combustion engines. Prior art titania and zirconia sen sors are characterised by little change in their respective elec trical characteristics at operating temperatures below about 350 C. A charge transfer material, platinum, has been applied to the ceramic element to facilitate or make possible the elec tron transfers required for sensor operation. Loss of the plati num charge transfer material by vapourization, as the result of operation at normal elevated temperatures, has been disco vered to be the cause of a loss of sensor response at low sen sor operating temperatures. The improved sensor has a char ge transfer material comprised of an alloy of platinum and rho dium. This alloy, which preferably is 90 platinum and 10 rho dium, reduces the minimum temperature of operation for the sensor and substantially eliminates the aforementioned vapou rization loss of the charge transfer material.
