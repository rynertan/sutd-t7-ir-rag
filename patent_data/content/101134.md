# A reel for coiling a plastic tube and a method of coiling a plastic tube on such a reel.

## Abstract
A reel 1 for coiling a plastic tube 23 of a highly crystallizable plastic the reel core of the reel comprises fixed reel core strips 4 and radially movable reel core strips 7 therebetween. The radially movable reel core strips are supported by a radially movable support arm 8 cooperating pivotally with a securing arm 9 . The securing arm is connected to a fixed frame 10 through a pivot 11 and a cam 13 engages the securing 9 and a slide valve 14 connected to a hydraulic cylinder 16 . The pressure fluid in the hydraulic cylinder 16 allows a gradual inward move ment of the movable strips 7 during shrinkage of a tube on this core In a method of coiling a plastic tube 23 of a highly crystallizable plastic, the tube is coiled at a temperature over 90 C on the reel of the invention and during cooling shrinkage is absorbed by the gradually inwardly movable strips 7 .
