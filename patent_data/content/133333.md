# Current limiter electric switch having a telecontrol suitable for a very high number of switching operations.

## Abstract
In a current limiter electric switch having fixed contacts, movable contacts, remote control means active upon the mov able contact carrier against spring bias, thermomagnetic protec tion means being also provided, the remote control means is a solenoid the core of which is directly connected to the movable contact carrier and in the excitation circuit of the solenoid con tacts are provided, which are opened when controlled by the thermomagnetic protection devices to have the solenoid dropped in the case of overcurrents which cause said protection devices to enter action.
