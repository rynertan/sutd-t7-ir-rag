# Polymeric ultraviolet light stabilisers containing hindered alkyl amines and polymer compositions containing them.

## Abstract
An ultraviolet light sensitive polymer composition wherein resistance to photodegradation is enhanced by the inclusion therein of a stabilizer polymer having structural units corresponding to the following formula The above stabilizer polymer can be simply combined with, or engrafted upon, the ultraviolet light sensitive polymer. The stabilizer polymer may also be copolymerized with, or grafted upon other polymeric materials thereby enhancing its phase compatibility with the ultraviolet light sensitive polymer. In certain instances, it is also possible to copolymerize the monomers from which are derived the ultraviolet light sensitive polymer and the stabilizer polymer.
