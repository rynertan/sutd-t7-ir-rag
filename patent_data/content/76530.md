The compounds of formula I may generally be prepared by the reaction of an amine of formulaEMI5.1 with an appropriately substituted carboxylic acid of formulaEMI5.2 or a functional derivative thereof. Suitable functional derivatives are acyl halides, having the formulaEMI5.3 esters, having the formulaEMI5.4 anhydrides, having the formulaEMI5.5 The reaction of II with III , Ill a , III b or III c may conveniently be carried out by stirring and, if desired, heating the reactants together in the presence of a suitable reaction inert solvent such as, for example, a halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g., dichloromethane and the like.The water, the alcohol or the acid which is liberated during the coarse of the reaction is preferably removed from the reaction mixture following art known procedures such as, for example, by azeotropical destillation, by complexation, by salt formation and the like methods. The compounds of formula I wherein R1 is hydrogen and wherein the substituents in the 3 and 4 positions of the piperidine ring have the trans configuration, said compounds being represented by the formula I a 1 , can aslo be prepared by reacting a 7 oxo 3 azabicycloL ,1,0U heptane of formula IV with a benzamide of formula V . The compounds of formula I wherein the substituents in the 3 and 4 positions of the piperidine ring have the trans configuration and wherein R1 is other than hydrogen, said R1 being represented by R1 a and said compounds by the formula I a 2 , may be derived from the compounds of formula I a l by reacting the latter with VI following art known O alkylating procedures.EMI6.1 In VI W has the meaning of a reactive leaving group such as, halo, preferably, chloro, bromo or iodo, a sulfonyloxy group, e.g., methylsulfonyloxy, 4 methylphenylsulfonyloxy, lower alkylcarbonyloxy, such as, acetoxy, and the like.

In certain cases the addition of an iodide salt, preferably an alkali metal iodide, is appropriate. Somewhat elevated temperatures may be used to enhance the reaction rate. The compounds of formula I wherein the substituents in the 3 and 4 positions of the piperidine ring have the cis configuration, said compounds being represented by the formula I b , can also be prepared by the reductive N alkylation reaction of a piperidinone of formula VII with a benzamide of formula V . EMI8.1 Said reductive N alkylation reaction may conviently be carried out by catalytically hydrogenating a stirred and heated mixture of the reactants in a suitable reaction inert organic solvent according to art known catalytically hydrogenating procedures. Suitable solvents are, for example, water lower alkanols, e.g., methanol, 2 propanol and the like cyclic ethers, e.g., 1,4 dioxane and the like halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g., trichloromethane and the like N,N dimethylformamide dimethyl sulk oxide and the like or a mixture of 2 or more of such solvents. The term art known catalytically hydrogenating procedures means that the reaction is carried out under hydrogen atmosphere and in the presence of an appropriate catalyst such as, for example, palladium on charcoal, platinum on charcoal and the like.In order to prevent the undesired further hydrogenation of certain functional groups in the reactants and the reaction products it may be advantageous to add an appropriate catalyst poison to the reaction mixture, e.g., thiophene and the like. The compounds of formula I may also be converted into each other following art known functional grouptransformation procedures. The compounds of formula I wherein L is hydrogen, said compounds being represented by the formula I c , can be converted into the corresponding compounds of formula I wherein L is other than hydrogen, said L being represented by L1 and said compounds by the formula I d , following art known N alkylating or N acylating procedures by reacting the former with a reagent of formula VIII .EMI9.1 In the reagent of formula VIII L1 has the meaning as previously described for L provided that hydrogen is not included. In some particular cases it may be advantageous to react the reagent of formula III with a precursor of a reagent of formula if . The compounds of formula I wherein L is other than hydrogen or lower alkyloxycarbonyl, said L being represented by L2 and said compounds by the formula I e , can also be prepared by the reductive amination reaction of an appropriate carbonyl compound of formula L2 C O IX , said L2 C O being a compound of formula L H wherein a 2 CH2 radical is displaced by a carbonyl radical.EMI10.1 In case L2 is a cycloalkyllower alkyl radical the compounds of formula I e may also be prepared starting from a corresponding reagent of formula IX wherein said ring is fully or partly unsaturated. The compounds of formula I wherein L represents a radical of formula Q Y CmH2m NH CH2 CH2 , said compounds being represented by the formula I f , can also be prepared by reacting a reagent of formula X with a piperidine of formula I c . EMI10.2 The compounds of formula I wherein L represents a radical of formula Q Y CmH2m CH OH CH2 , said compounds being represented by the formula I g , can also be prepared by reacting an oxirane of formula XI with a piperidine of formula I c .EMI11.1 The preparation of the compounds of formula I f and I g starting from X and I c , respectively XI and I c , can conveniently be conducted in a suitable reactioninert organic solvent such as, for example, an alcohol, such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, 2 propanol and the like, or an aliphatic or alicyclic ketone, such as, for example, 2 propanone, 2 butanone, 4 methyl 2 pentanone, cyclohexanone and the like. The addition of an appropriate base, such as, for example, an alkali metal carbonate or hydrogen carbonate, may be utilized to enhance the rate of reaction. The reaction is preferably carried out at a somewhat elevated temperature and most preferably at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. The compounds of formula I wherein L is lower alkyloxycarbonyl, said compounds being represented by the formula I h , may be converted into the corresponding compounds of formula I c , by stirring and, if desired, heating the starting compounds I h in a suitable organic solvent such as, for example, an alcohol, e.g., 2 propanol and the like, an ether, e.g., tetrahydrofuran and the like, in the presence of an appropriate base, e.g., alkali or earth alkaline metal hydroxides, carbonates or hydrogen carbonates, e.g., sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate and the like.EMI12.1 The compounds of formula I wherein L is an Ar2CH2 radical, said compounds being represented by the formula I i , may, for example, be converted into the compounds of formula I c by a catalytic hydrogenolysis reaction, e.g., by stirring the starting I i in a suitable reaction inert solvent, such as, methanol and the like solvents, under hydrogen atmosphere, in the presence of an appropriate catalyst such as, for example, palladium on charcoal, platinum on charcoal and the like.In case R1 is an arylmethyl radical, said radical may simultaneously be converted into the hydrogen radical.EMI12.2 A number of the radicals R1, R2, R3, R4 and or R5 may also be converted into each other following art known functional group transformation procedures. For example, the nitro function may be converted into an amine function following art known nitro to amine reducing procedures by stirring and, if desired, heating the starting nitrocompound in a suitable solvent, e.g., methanol and the like, in the presence of an appropriate catalyst, e.g., palladium on charcoal, platinum on charcoal and the like.A cyanide function may be converted into an aminocarbonyl function by stirring the starting compound in strong acidic medium, e.g., in concentrated sulfuric acid and the like. A lower alkylcarbonyloxy function can be converted into a hydroxy function following art known alkaline hydrolysis procedures. Vice versa, the hydroxy function can be converted into a lower alkylcarbonyloxy function by stirring the former with an appropriate acylating agent, e.g., an acid anhydride and the like. From formula I it is evident that the compounds of this invention have at least two asymmetric carbon atoms in their structure, namely those located in the 3 and the 4 positions of the piperidine nucleus, and consequently they can exist under different stereochemically isomeric forms. The stereochemically isomeric forms of I and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof are intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention. The diastereomeric racemates of I , denoted as cis and trans forms respectively, according to the rules described in C.A., 76, Index Guide, Section IV, p. 85 1972 , may be obtained separately by conventional methods. Appropriate methods which may advantageously be employed therefore include, for example, selective crystallization and chromatography separation, e.g., column chromatography. Since the stereochemical configuration is already fixed in the intermediates II it is also possible to separate cis and trans forms at this or even an earlier stage, whereupon the corresponding forms of I may be derived therefrom in the previously indicated manner.The separation of cis and trans forms of such intermediates may be performed by conventional methods as described hereinabove for the separation of cis and trans forms of the compounds of formula I . It is evident that the cis and trans diastereomeric racemates may be further resolved into their optical isomers, cis , cis , trans and trans by the application of methodologies known to those skilled in the art. The compounds of formula I having basic properties may be converted to their therapeutically useful acid addition salts by reaction with an appropriate acid, such as, for example, an inorganic acid such as hydrohalic acid, i.e., hydrochloric, hydrobromic or hydroiodic acid sulfuric, nitric or thiocyanic acid a phosphoric acid and organic acid such as acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, 2 hydroxypropanoic, 2 oxopropanoic, ethanedioic, propanedioic, 1, 4 butanedioic, 2 butenedioic, E 2 butenedioic, 2 hydroxy 1 ,4 butanedioic, 2, 3 dihydroxy 1,4 butanedioic, 2 hydroxy 1,2,3 propanetricarboxylic, benzoic, 3 phenyl 2 propenoic, a hydroxybenzeneacetic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, 2 hydroxyethanesulfonic, 4 methylbenzenesulfonic, 2 hydroxybenzoic, 4 amino2 hydroxybenzoic, 2 phenoxybenzoic or 2 acetyloxybenzoic acidThe salts are in turn converted to the corresponding free bases in the usual manner, e.g., by reaction with alkali such as sodium or potassium hydroxide. The compounds of formula I may conveniently be converted into their quaternary ammonium salts by reacting the former with an appropriate quaternizing agent and, if desired, subsequently exchanging the anion of the thus obtained quaternary compound. A number of the intermediates and starting materials used in the foregoing preparations are known compounds, others may be prepared according to art known methodologies of preparing similar compounds and some of them are novel and consequently their preparations will be described hereinafter. The intermediates of formula II can generally be prepared in a stereospecific way starting from an appropriately substituted 7 oxa 3 azabicyclofi4,1,0J heptane XII or from an appropriately substituted 4 piperidinone XIII as shown in scheme 1, wherein P represents an appropriate protective group such as, for example, phenylmethyl, ethoxycarbonyl and the like protective groups. The intermediates II having the substituents in the 3 and 4 positions of the piperidine ring in trans configuration and RÚ being hydrogen, II a 1 , can be prepared by reacting XII with a reagent of formula XIV and eliminating P of the thus obtained XV . The intermediates II having the substituents in the 3 and 4 position of the piperidine ring in trans configuration and RÚ being R1 a, II a 2 , can be derived from II a 1 , by reacting the latter with VI . The intermediates II a 2 can also be prepared by reacting XV with VI and subsequently eliminating P of the thus obtained XVI . The intermediates II having the substituents in the 3 and 4 positions of the piperidine ring in cis configuration, II b , can be prepared by reacting XIII with IV , following art known reductive N alkylatingprocedures, and subsequently eliminating P of the thus obtained XVII . EMI16.1 Scheme 1 The trans 4 amino 3 piperidinols XV can be converted into the corresponding cis 4 amino 3 piperidinols XVII , following art known standard methods, e.g., by converting the amine function into an amide function, converting the alcohol function into an appropriate leaving group with retention of the configuration and, finally, reacting the thus obtained intermediates with hydrazine, if desired, at elevated temperature.EMI17.1 An analogous convertion has been described in Helv.Chim. Acta 62, 932 941 1979 . The intermediates IV , respectively VII , can be derived from XII , respectively XIII by eliminating P and subsequently reacting the thus formed intermediates of formula IV , respectively VII wherein L is hydrogen, IV a , respectively VII a with VIII following artknown N alkylating or N acylating procedures.EMI17.2 The 7 oxa 3 azabicycloC4,1,0 heptanes XII , used as starting materials in the foregoing reactions, may be prepared by oxidizing the corresponding 1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridines XIX with an appropriate epoxidizing agent such as, for example, hydrogen peroxide, 3 chlorobenzeneperoxoic acid and the like.EMI18.1 epoxidizing agentEMI18.2 The 4 piperidinones XIII , used as starting materials in the foregoing reactions, may be derived from an appropriately substituted 4 piperidinone XIX , e.g., by halogenating XIX with a halogenating agent such as bromine and the like and subsequently reacting the thus obtained XX with an appropriate alcohol of formulaR1OH or an appropriate alkali metal or earth alkaline metal salt thereof.EMI18.3 halogenating agentEMI18.4 R1OH or an alkali or XIII earth alkaline metal salt In case a piperidine of formula XXI is intermediately formed said XXI can be converted into XIII by stirring the latter in acidic aqueous medium. EMI19.1 The intermediates of formula XXI can be derived from a corresponding vinyl ether by reacting the latter with a suitable epoxidizing agent in an appropriate alcohol see, for example, Synthetic Communications, 10, 1 , 83 87 1980 and Synthesis, 38 39 1974 . The compounds of formula I , their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, when systemically administered to vertebrates, stimulate the motility of the gastrointestinal system. The stimulatory effect of the subject compounds on the motility of the gastro intestinal system is evidenced by the data collected in the tables 1 and 2, which data illustrate the amplification of the contractions of the guinea pig ileum Test A , the antagonism of dopamineinduced gastric relaxations Test B and the antroduodenal motility of the dog Test C caused by the subject compounds.Test A Amplification of contractions induced by trans mural stimulation of guinea pig ileum. Non terminal ileum segments of the guinea pig were vertically suspended with a preload of 1 g in a 100 ml tyrode bath 37.50C and gassed with a mixture of 95 O2 and 5 CO2. Contractions were measured isometrically.Transmural excitation was applied over the whole length of the ileum strip by means of two platinum electrodes 0.5 mm diameter , the anode was passed through the lumen of the ileum, the cathode was dipped into a physiological solution. The tissue was excited with single rectangular stimuli of 1 msec duration and submaximal intensity at a frequency of 6 per minute, said stimuli being known to release acetylcholine from intramural nerve endings. After a stabilization period of 30 minutes, a single dose of the test substance was added to the bath solution and its effect was followed for another 15 minutes.Drug effects are expressed as percentage of the initial contractility value. Column 1 of table 1 illustrates the lowest effective concentration of the test substance whereby a significant stimulation of the acetylcholine release is noted.References Arch. Intern. Pharmacodyn. Ther., 204, 37 55 1973 and Drug Research 24, 1641 1645 1974 .Test B Antagonism of dopamine induced gastric relaxation. Experiments were performed on stomachs taken from fasted guinea pigs. The oesophagus, the first 10 cm of the duodenum, the vagal truncae and the coeliac axic with the gastric branches thereof were removed together with the stomach. The gastro intestinal content was removed by repeated washing. A polyethylene cannula was placed in the coeliac axis. After ligating the oesophagus, the stomach was filled with 20 ml of saline and suspended in 200 ml of oxygenated 95 O2,5tCO2 Krebs Henseleit solution maintained at 370C. A glass cannula was placed into the duodenum and connected to an ultrasonic transit time device. The cannula was further connected to a bottle of saline ensuring a constant hydrostatic pressure of 6 cm saline in the stomach. With this system changes in gastric content can be continuously recorded.Emptying and filling of the stomach correspond to contractions and relaxations of the gastric wall, respectively. Dopamine 50 ssg was injected via the coeliac axis in volumes of 0.1 0.2 ml.The test substances studied for antagonistic effects were added to the bath solution in 0.5 ml of saline. Column 2 of table 1 illustrates the lowest effective dose whereby antagonistic effects are observed.Reference Life Sciences, 23, 453 457 1978 .Test C. Antroduodenal motility of the conscious dog. Strain gauge force transducers are constructed and calibrated ex vivo see, for example, GastrointestinalMotility in Health and Disease , p. 647 654, edited byL.L. Duthie, MTP, Lancaster . Labrador dogs, weighing 25 33 kg, were implanted with force transducers under aseptic conditions. Transducers were sutured in transverse direction to the serosal side of the gastric antrum and the duodenum respectively 4 cm and 8 cm from the gastroduodenal junction . The lead wires were brought out via a subcutaneous tunnel on the left costal flank through a stab wound between the scapulas. Before each experiment the connector was soldered to the lead wires. Experiments were started in the ginescence phase of the interdigestive state after a fasting period of 18 hours. Water was available ad libitum. During the experiments the dogs layed down at ease in little carriages. Antroduodenal motor patterns were amplified J.S.I., transducer amplifier and recorded on a carbon paper writer Scwarzer . Parameters measured are amplitude force of contractions in grams, frequency of contractions and percentage of coordination defined as the relative number of antral waves that propagated to the duodenum. Drugs were administered either orally or via injection into a brachial vein. Drug response was followed for at least 2 hours. Table 2 shows the minimal effective dose, in mg kg body weight, whereby the rhythmic activity of the stomach is augmented and regularized. The data illustrated in tables 1 and 2 are intended to illustrate and not to limit the scope of the present invention.

In view of their useful activity to stimulate the motility of the gastro intestinal system the subject compounds may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention an effective amount of the particular compound or compounds, in base or acid addition salt form, as the active ingredients, is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, said amount being an amount which is effective to stimulate the motility of the gastrointestinal system.These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, rectally or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets.Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed.Acid addition salts of I , due to their increased water solubility over the corresponding base form, are abviously more suitable in the preparation of aqueous compositions. It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets including scored or coated tablets , capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof. The amount of active ingredient per dosage unit will be from about 0.25 mg to about 100 mg and, preferably from about 1 to about 50 mg. The following formulations exemplify compositions typical for the stimulation of the motility of the gastro intestinal system in dosage unit form suitable for systemic administration to animal and human subjects in accordance with the instant invention.
