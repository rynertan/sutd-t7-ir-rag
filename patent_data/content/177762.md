## Description
The present invention relates to resinous compositions based on a saponified product of an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer referred to as EVOH hereinafter and to impact resistant molded articles and containers made of said resinous compositions. EVOH is a thermoplastic resin which is incomparably superior to other resins in oil resistance, organic solvent resistance, stiffness, hardness, abrasion resistance, and oxygen barrier properties. However, it has a disadvantage of being poor in impact resistance and being hard and brittle. There are some known methods for improving the impact resistance of EVOH by blending it with a rubber like material. For example, there is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 3185 1967 the improvement by blending it with an ethylene vinyl carboxylate copolymer or ethylene acrylate copolymer. These methods are still inadequate for achieving an improvement in impact resistance and moldability because of the poor dispersion of the resin to be blended. Another example of the blended EVOH is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid open No. 131033 1980. According to the disclosure, a resinous composition is produced by blending 50 to 97 parts by weight of EVOH and 50 to 3 parts by weight of a thermoplastic polyolefin copolymer having carbonyl groups C O derived from an unsaturated carboxylic acid or an anhydride thereof. Examples of such copolymers include maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene, ionomer resins, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers and ethylene acrylate copolymers. This resinous composition finds use as packaging material that can be easily cut with an edged tool. Even this resinous composition has no satisfactory impact resistance and gel forming occurs during molding. Further, Japanese Patent Laid open No.86579 1975 discloses a composition composed of EVOH and a polyolefin e.g., polyethylene modified with an unsaturated polybasic oarboxylic acid. It also discloses a multi layered blow molded container made by coextrusion of the composition and a polyolefin. The composition still has the same disadvantages as mentioned above. This will be more clearly understood from the comparative examples mentioned later. In EP A 0 152 180 a polymer alloy is disclosed which is a mixture of grafted and ungrafted polyvinyl alcohol polymers. A polymer alloy is prepared by reacting a polyvinyl alcohol polymer which has a degree of hydrolysis of less than 98 mole with less than the stoichiometric amount of a functional olefin polymer containing functional groups which are reactive with the hydroxyl groups of the polyvinyl alcohol polymer. This polymer alloy exhibits excellent moisture resistance and good separation of the melting and decomposition points without a significant loss of gas barrier properties. Melt blending of the polymer alloy with a compatible polyolefin blending resin further improves moisture resistance. The technical problem underlying the present invention is to provide resinous compositions based on EVOH which have improved impact resistance and which are comparable to unmodified EVOH in oil resistance, organic solvent resistance, and oxygen barrier properties and to provide molded articles produced by melt processing of the resinous compositions and also containers of multilayered structure formed by coextrusion of the resinous compositions and a thermoplastic resin. It has been found that the impact resistance of EVOH is greatly improved when a product obtained by adding a C₃ C₁₀ α,β unsaturated carboxylic acid or an anhydride thereof to an ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester copolymer or an ethylene acrylate ester copolymer is being incorporated with the EVOH. The present invention is based on these findings. The resinous compositions of this invention are comparable to unmodified EVOH in oil resistance, organic solvent resistance, and oxygen barrier properties. The present invention provides resinous compositions which comprise A 95 to 50 parts by weight of EVOH and B 5 to 50 parts by weight of modified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester copolymer or a modified ethylene acrylate ester copolymer comprising ethylene, a vinyl carboxylate ester or an acrylate ester, and an C₃ C₁₀ α,β unsaturated carboxylic acid or acid anhydride, wherein said modified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester copolymer or modified ethylene acrylate ester copolymer contains 60 to 95 mol of ethylene and X mol of an α,β unsaturated carboxylic acid or acid anhydride and has a melt index of Y g 10 min 190 C, 2160 g , where X and Y are those values that satisfy the following equations I and II . The EVOH used in the present invention contains 20 to 60 mol , preferably 25 to 60 mol of ethylene and has a degree of saponification greater than 95 mol . If the ethylene content in EVOH is lower than 20 mol , the resulting composition has a high molding temperature which is close to the decomposition temperature, which makes molding difficult. If the ethylene content in EVOH is higher than 60 mol , the resulting composition is poor in oil resistance and stiffness. If the degree of saponification is lower than 95 mol , the resulting composition loses its oil resistance and heat stability. The modified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester or modified ethylene acrylate ester copolymer used in this invention contains 60 to 95 mol of ethylene and X mol of an α,β unsaturated carboxylic acid or acid anhydride and has a melt index of Y g 10 min 190 C, 2160 g , where X and Y are those values that satisfy the following equations I and II . If the content X of the α,β unsaturated carboxylic acid or acid anhydride is less than 0.01 mol , the modified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester or modified ethylene acrylate ester copolymer has a poor dispersion at the time of blending and is consequently poor in impact resistance. If it exceeds 3 mol , the modified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester or modified ethylene acrylate ester copolymer becomes excessively viscous during the blending operation and the resulting composition exhibits a poor moldability and other physical properties. In addition, it is necessary that X, Y, and Z satisfy the above mentioned formula II , where X is the amount mol of an α,β unsaturated carboxylic acid or acid anhydride, Y is the melt index of the modified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester or modified ethylene acrylate ester copolymer, and Z is the melt index of the EVOH. If they are outside the values specified by the equation II , the α,β unsaturated carboxylic acid or its anhydride do not exhibit a good effect and no great improvement is made with respect to dispersion and to impact resistance. The modified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester copolymer used in this invention contains a vinyl carboxylate ester component represented by the formula where R is a linear or branched alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Typical examples of the vinyl carboxylate ester include vinyl formate, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl butyrate, vinyl octanoate, vinyl dodecanoate, vinyl stearate, and vinyl arachinate. Preferable among them is vinyl acetate. The modified ethylene acrylate ester copolymer used in this invention contains one acrylate ester component represented by the formula where R is a linear or branched alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Typical examples of the acrylate ester include methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexylacrylate, dodecyl acrylate, octadecyl acrylate, and eicosyl acrylate. Among them methyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate are preferred. The above mentioned vinyl carboxylate ester and acrylate ester lead to the same effect of improving the impact resistance of the resinous composition. The former permits the resinous composition to keep its impact strength even after immersion in a surfactant solution or an organic solvent for a long time. Therefore, the resinous compositions of the invention are very suitable for bottles for cosmetics, liquid detergents, and agricultural chemicals. On the other hand, the acrylate ester, which has a higher decomposition temperature than the vinyl carboxylate ester, imparts improved characteristics concerning the moldability at high temperatures and impact resistance at low temperatures to the resinous compositions. The modified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester copolymers and modified ethylene acrylate ester copolymers used in this invention contain an α,β unsaturated carboxylic acid or acid anhydride having 3 to 10 carbon atoms. It includes, for example, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, ethacrylic acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid, maleic anhydride, and itaconic anhydride. Maleic anhydride and itaconic anhydride are preferred. The resinous oompositions of this invention comprise 95 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 95 to 60 parts by weight, of EVOH and 5 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 5 to 40 parts by weight of the modified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester copolymer or modified ethylene acrylate ester copolymer. The preferred amount of modified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester copolymer is 5 to 40 parts by weight, and the preferred amount of modified ethylene acrylate ester copolymer is 5 to 30 parts by weight. If the amount of modified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester copolymer or modified ethylene acrylate ester copolymer is less than 5 parts by weight, the resulting resinous composition is not sufficiently improved in impact resistance, and if the amount is in excess of 50 parts by weight, the superior oil resistance and stiffness of EVOH is impaired. The modified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester copolymer or modified ethylene acrylate ester copolymer used in this invention may be produced in a per se known manner. It should preferably be produced by grafting an α,β Unsaturated carboxylic acid or an anhydride thereof on an ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester copolymer or an ethylene acrylate ester copolymer. In the process of producing the modified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester copolymer or modified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester copolymer, a vinyl monomer may be copolymerized in an amount less than 5 mol without any adverse effect on the resinous composition of this invention. Also, in the process of producing the modified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester copolymer or modified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester copolymer, the former may be incorporated with an unmodified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester copolymer, or the latter may be incorporated with an unmodified ethylene acrylate ester copolymer. In the process of blending EVOH with other components, the modified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester copolymer and an unmodified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester copolymer may be blended simultaneously, or the modified ethylene acrylate ester copolymer and an unmodified ethylene acrylate ester copolymer may be blended simultaneously. The blending of EVOH with the modified ethylene vinyl carboxylate ester copolymer or a modified ethylene acrylate ester copolymer may be accomplished by the use of a Banbury mixer or a single or twin screw extruder. In the process of blending, other additives may be added in such an amount that the action and effect of this invention are not impaired. Examples of such additives include one or many of the following compounds antioxidants, ultraviolet light absorbers, plasticizers, antistatic agents, slip agents, coloring agents, fillers, and other polymeric compounds. Specific examples of the additives are as follows The resinous compositions of this invention can be molded to form a film, sheet, tube, and bottle and any other desired shape by using a known melt extrusion molding machine, compression molding machine, transfer molding machine, injection molding machine, blow molding machine, thermoforming machine, rotational molding machine, or dip molding machine. The extrusion temperature for molding should be properly selected according to the type and molecular weight of the resins, the formulation of the composition, and the performance of the extruder. It is usually in the range of 180 to 260 C. The resinous compositions of this invention can be molded by coextrusion with a proper thermoplastic resin e.g., polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide, polypropylene, polyethylene, polycarbonate, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride . The coextrusion provides laminated moldings which are superior in impact resistance. The resinous compositions of this invention is also useful as the inner layer or interlayer of a container bottle made of one of the above mentioned thermoplastic resins. The multilayered bottles can be produced by the direct blow molding in which bottles are made from a coextruded multilayered parison , by cold parison technique in which multilayered pipes parisons are made by coextrusion and subsequently the parisons are processed into bottles by biaxial orientation , or by injection blow molding with multiple layers. The bottles produced as mentioned above are superior in resistance to chemicals and organic solvents contained in the case where the inner layer is made of a resinous composition of this invention. Therefore, the bottles are suitable as containers for organic liquids, cosmetics and agricultural chemicals. The application of the resinous compositions of this invention is not limited to bottles and containers. They can be processed to a laminated film or sheet by coextrusion with one of the above mentioned thermo plastic resins. In this case, a resinous composition may be used as the interlayer. The laminate sheet containing an interlayer of a resinous composition of the invention can be processed into cups or similar containers by deep draw forming. The laminate film with the interlayer of the resinous composition will find use e.g. as packaging material for wine and photograph developing solutions. In the production of the above mentioned laminates e.g. bottles, tubes, sheets, and films , it is possible to use an adhesive to bond the layer of the resinous composition of this invention to the layer of the thermoplastic resin. The choice of this interlaminar adhesive is not specifically restricted as long as it firmly bonds the two layers together. A preferred product is obtained by modifiying e.g. grafting a thermoplastic resin e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, and ethylene acrylate ester copolymer with 0.005 to 5 wt of an unsaturated carboxylic acid or acid anhydride e.g. maleic anhydride . The invention is now described in more detail with reference to the following examples. The test methods and evaluation methods used in the examples and comparative examples are as follows Expressed in terms of the amount of resin which emerges from the melt indexer for 10 minutes when a load of 2160 g is applied at 190 C according ASTM D 1238.

The results are shown in Table 4. In the case of modified ethylene acrylate ester copolymer containing 3.0 mol of maleic anhydride, there was a tendency that the torque of the blender increases during mixing and the composition is slightly colored. The improvement in impact strength was almost the same as that in the case where maleic anhydride is not used.
