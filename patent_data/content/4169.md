# Electrochemical cell with an electrode having deposited thereon an electrocatalyst preparation of said cell.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an electrochemical cell with an electrode having deposited thereon an electrocatalyst which is a mixed oxide of nickel molybdenum, nickel tungsten, cobalt molybdenum or cobalt tungsten and containing an aqueous alkaline electrolyte comprising an aqueous solution of a molybdenum, vanadium or tungsten compound. The electrodes are preferably prepared by alternately coating an electrode core with a compound of nickel or cobalt, and with a compound of molybdenum or tungsten, said compounds being capable of thermal decomposition to the corresponding oxides, heating the coated core at an elevated temperature to form a layer of the mixed oxides on the core and finally curing the core with the mixed oxide layer thereon in a reducing atmosphere at a temperature between 350 C and 600 C. The cells are particularly suitable for use in the electrolysis of water or brine.
