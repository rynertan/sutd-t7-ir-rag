# IMPROVEMENTS TO SEMICONDUCTOR LASERS

## Abstract
These improvements to semiconductor lasers allow the fabrication of high efficiency photoemitting devices thanks to a decrease in the threshold current necessary to optical emis sion stimulation. They consist in the application of a suitable magnetic field apt to confine carrier current within a limited zone of the active layer.
