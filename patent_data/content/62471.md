# Thin film solar cell.

## Abstract
A thin film solar cell formed on a substrate 1, or 11 com prising at least a first and a second electrode 2 and 5, or 11 and 13 at least one of which is capable of passing light, a sili con film 3 or 12 interposed between said first and second electrodes, and at least one junction formed in the silicon film for separating electrons and positive holes spatially when the cell is exposed to light wherein said silicon film comprises a mixed phase of polycrystalline phase and amorphous phase, and includes fibrous crystalline grains of at least about 50 by volume, each of said grains being at most 1 Âµm in a bottom di ameter and at least 50 nm in height and having its boundary terminated with monovalent element. The solar cell has a high photoelectric conversion effi ciency comparable to that of a single crystalline solar cell, and can be produced at a low cost.
