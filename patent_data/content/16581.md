# Ziegler type catalyst composition.

## Abstract
A catalyst system for alphaolefin type polymerizations, includes at least one hindered alkyl metal amide compound having the formula R ₂YNR₂ in combination with a Group IVA VIII transition metal compound on a support and at least one Lewis base wherein R is C₃ to C₂₀ bulky alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl or substituted aryl groups or R₂N is a hindered cyclic amide group R is C₁ to C₂₀ primary alkyl, secondary alkyl, tertiary alkyl, neopentyl alkyl, branched alkyl, cycloalkyl or aralkyl groups, and Y is aluminium, gallium or indium. The catalyst system provides polymers having increased isotactic stereoregularity as well as lower catalyst residue.
