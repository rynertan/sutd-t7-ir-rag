# Treatment of materials for protection against degradation and a wooden body thus treated.

## Abstract
A method of treating a fibrous material, such as wood 10 , to inhibit degradation thereof, which comprises insert ing an electrically conductive element 12 into the wood 10 to serve as an electrode, disposing the wood 10 in a volume of electrolyte, such as sea water, disposing a second electrode in the electrolyte, connecting the electrode 12 and a second electrode to opposed terminals of a direct current power supply source, and establishing a current between the electrodes to produce electrolytic activity. The electrode constituted by element 12 may be the cathode or the anode. In the latter case, when a suitable electrolyte, such as sea water, is used, chlorine is released at the anode to destroy organisms in the vicinity. In the former case, it is possible to deposit a high strength protective coating of mineral material on the surfaces of the e.g. wood 10 .
