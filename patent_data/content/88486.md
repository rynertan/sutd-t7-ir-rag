# ROTARY TRANSMISSION

## Abstract
The transmission is intended to effect synchronism between the speed of an engine and the speed of a trans mission input shaft. An engine 7 drive clutch 13 and gearbox 14 combination is provided which comprises automatic change speed means 8 to engage and disen gage the drive clutch and to select a required gearbox ratio. A further clutch 42 is also provided which is responsive to said change speed means to control engine speed during a ratio change with the drive clutch disenaged. The further clutch 42 reacts against the output shaft 28 of the gear box to synchronise engine speed with the speed of the transmission input shaft 21 during the ratio change and enables drive to be transmitted between the engine and outputs shaft with the drive clutch 13 disengaged.
