# A rotatable sleeve for guiding a web of wire strands.

## Abstract
A rotatable sleeve 20 for guiding at least one strand of wire 39 , for example, includes a tubular outer member 21 bonded to a tubular, dimensionally stable inner member 22 which is press fitted onto a rotatable shaft e.g. 36 . Dimensional stability is imparted from the inner member 22 to the outer member 21 which undergoes radial stress from the wire strand 39 . For spacing a plurality of wire strands at a predetermined distance from one another, grooves 24 are machined into the outer member 21 of the rotatable sleeve 20 . A further feature provides another tubular member 23 inside the inner member 22 for optimizing the press fit of the rotatable sleeve 20 to the shaft 36 .
