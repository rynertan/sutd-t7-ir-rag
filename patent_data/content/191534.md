# A method for dicing a semiconductor wafer.

## Abstract
A method for dicing a semiconductor wafer to dices which comprises a placing and fixing the wafer on a dicing film which comprises a base film permeable to ultraviolet light and a layer of a pressure sensitive adhesive formed on one side of the base film to fix thereon the wafer, the adhesive comprising i at least one elastic polymer selected from the group consisting of polyacrylic acid ester copolymers and saturated copolyesters ii an ultraviolet light polymerizable acrylic acid ester having not less than two acryloyl or methacryloyl groups in the molecule and having a molecular weight of not more than about 1000, in amounts of about 15 200 parts by weight in relation to 100 parts by weight of the elastic polymer and iii a photopolymerization initiator in a sufficient amount to induce the photopolymerization of the ultraviolet light polymeriz able acrylic acid ester b dicing the wafer c applying the ultraviolet light to the other side of the dicing film to substantially reduce the adhesive force of the dicing film and then d removing the resultant dices from the dicing film.
