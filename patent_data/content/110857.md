# A self teaching device for signalling to the driver of a vehicle that a gear change is indicated.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method and a device for signal ing to a vehicle operator that a higher gear should be selected. A microprocessor 1 is connected so that it can sense the rota tional speed of the engine via 3 and the vehicle road speed via 2 . The quotient of the road speed and the engine speed is de termined and is commpared with a series of predetermined quotients, one for each of the gear selector positions, and the engaged gear is thus determined. For each gear there is regis tered the quotient of its own gear ratio and that of the next higher gear position, the quotient being zero for the highest gear. The engine speed signal is multiplied by this gear ratio value for the gear engaged and is compared with a maximum value, and if the result exceeds the maximum value, a signal is sent to indicate that a gear change should be made. In accord ance with a preferred embodiment, the fact is utilized that the generator, if the generator belts slips, will produce an engine speed value which is too low, so that the first mentioned meas ured quotient will not agree with the predetermined quotient. An error indication is then sent indicating the need for service.
