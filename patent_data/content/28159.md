# Orifice plate assembly for an ink jet printing device and method of manufacturing such an assembly.

## Abstract
An orifice plate 10 for use in an ink jet printer is integrally cast with an orifice plate holder 12 . The orifice plate has a flat bottom portion containing two rows of orifices 22 and sidewalls 11 extending outwardly from the bottom portion at acute angles. The orifice plate holder 12 is formed from a castable plastics material which serves as a damping material. The holder is cast over and around the sidewalls 11 of the orifice plate to define, with the bottom portion of the orifice plate, a portion of an ink supply manifold. The damping action of the holder isolates the orifice plate 10 from spurious vibrations which could adversely affect the quality of printing from the ink jet printer. Only the desired vibration from the stimulation transducer reaches the orifice plate. The mass and rigidity of the holder confines the travelling wave induced by the transducer to the orifice plate.
