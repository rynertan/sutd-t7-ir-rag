## Description
Process for the preparation of colour stabilised vinyl chloride Dolymers This invention relates to a process for stabilising a vinyl chloride polymer against colour deterioration by the use of aromatic beta diketones such as dibenzoyl methane and stearoyl benzoyl methane, and to shaped articles manufactured from such stabilised polymers. In general, vinyl chloride polymers have poor thermal colour stability. This is reflected in decomposition, discolouration and brittleness of the polymer when it is subjected to elevated temperatures through shaping operations, for example, through injection moulding, extrusion and bottle blowing machines. It is well known that certain organic salts of zine and calcium such as their stearates are effective thermal stabilisers which result in a good initial colour and brightness in the shaped material. These properties are important, for example, in the production of bottles from a polymer having a relatively low Kvalue and good flow.However, the use of zinc and calcium organic salts as stabilisers does not always enable the most stringent commercial criteria to be met, particularly in processes such as bottle manufacture where it is customary to reprocess any bottles whose moulding is unsatisfactory. Such reprocessing procedures thereby impose a repeated thermal stress on the recycled material and thus require an improved level of stabilisation.For technical and economic reasons, it is naturally desirable for any stabiliser to be utilised in the smallest proportion which will achieve the desired commercial result. Also it is often convenient for the stabiliser to be added during the actual polymerisation, since the subsequent processing is thereby simplified by the reduction in the number and complexity of the additives to be incorporated. However, the suspension system used in the polymerisation of vinyl chloride calls for a precise balance of conditions, which can often be affected adversely by the presence of additional components, and hence it is often found impractical to incorporate the stabiliser during polymerisation. It is known from UK Patent Specifications 1,08h,578 and l,5ll,621 that acceptable stabilisation of polyvinyl chloride can be obtained by incorporating dibenzoyl methane or stearoyl benzoyl methane, in an amount of 0.1 or 0.05 to 5 by weight together with a metal carboxylate such as zinc or calcium stearate.The former specification gives no details on the procedures employed for the actual incorporation of the stabiliser into the polymer whilst the latter specification discloses that the stabiliser may be incorporated at the same time as the other additives, such as plasticisers, pigments and lubricants, either simultaneously or sequentially, suitable blending methods being through homogenisation in a mixer or kneader. Thus the teaching of these documents is that stabilisation of PVC using diketones requires the PVC to be homogenised with at least 0.05 , by weight, of stabiliser.However, the Applicants have now surprisingly found that aromatic beta diketone stabilisers may not only be incorporated during the polymerisation of the vinyl chloride monomer, but moreover their incorporation at this stage permits the attainment of satisfactory stability with significantly lower proportions of stabiliser. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the production of a colour stabilised polymer of vinyl chloride wherein an aqueous suspension of vinyl chloride is 1 polymerised in the presence of from 0.005 to 0.042 by weight of the vinyl chloride of an acyl acetophenone stabiliser of the formula EMI3.1 wherein R represents an alkyl or aryl group optionally substitued by a carboxyl group, or an alkylene group linking with another 3 phenyl l, 3 oxopropyl moiety, and 2 the resulting polyvinyl chloride is blended with 0.001 to 5 by weight of the polymer with one or more divalent metal carboxylates. Preferred stabilisers are compounds of formula I wherein R represents a long chain aIkyl group of up to 30 carbon atoms, for example stearyl a short chain alkyl substituted by carboxyl, for example 4 carboxy butyl a phenyl or carboxyphenyl group or a short chain alkylene group, such as tetramethylene, linking with another 3 phenyl l,3 oxopropyl moiety. Particularly preferred individual compounds include dibenzoyl methane, stearoyl benzoyl methane and dibenzoyl adipoyl methane 1,10 diphenyl 1,3,8,10 decanetetraone , which are desirably present in an amount between 0.025 o.o by weight of the vinyl chloride. The stabiliser may be introduced as a separate component or may be introduced in solution or suspension in one of the other initial reactants. Although it can be added during the polymerisation if operational conditions so require, it is preferred to introduce it at the earliest practicable stage, and thus it is normally present at the start of the polymerisation. The vinyl polymer is preferably obtained by homopolymerisat ion of a vinyl chloride monomer, although copolymers may also be used for example with vinylidene chloride, vinyl acetate or methyl acrylate. In the suspension system used in the polymerisation the weight ratio of monomer s plus polymer to water is usually in excess of 0.2 and is preferably between 0.4 and 0.8. The suspension is stabilised by incorporation of polyvinyl alcohol which is usually added to the aqueous phase in an amount of 0.0001 to 5 by weight, preferably in an amount of 0.001 to 0.2 by weight, based on the weight of the suspension system, i.e. on the weight of water, monomer s and polymer, if present.The polyvinyl alcohol used normally has a degree of hydrolysis of 50 100 , and a molecular weight such that a 4 solution in water at room temperature has a viscosity of 1 100 centipoises. In addition to polyvinyl alcohol, other suspension stabilisers may be used, such as, for example, alkylaryl sulphonates and methyl cellulose. The suspension polymerisation of vinyl chloride is carried out under the influence of a radical initiator such as azobisisobutyronitrile, percarbonates, dibenzoyl peroxide, dicaproyl peroxide, dilauroyl peroxide, ditertiary butyl peroxide, acetylcyclohexane sulphonyl peroxide or combinations of these peroxides.The peroxides are used in amounts varying from 0.0005 2 by weight, preferably 0.02 0.3 by weight, based on the monomer.The pH is preferably maintained between 8 and h. The suspension system may also contain other substances such as chain transfer agents, e.g. dodecyl mercaptan, thioethanol or a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate and sodium tripolyphosphate, in amounts of up to approximately 5 by weight, based on the monomer s . The polymerisation is normally carried out at temperatures between 450C and 80 C. The pressure in the polymerisation reactor may vary from 5 to 20 atm. The K value of the polymer may be controlled by varying the polymerisation temperature and pressure, appropriate temperatures being between 600C and 750cm The divalent metal carboxylate blended with the polyvinyl chloride is suitably a zinc or calcium salt of a long chain aliphatic acid, such as octanoic or stearic acid, although carboxylates of barium and cadmium are also effective, and is preferably employed in an amount of 0.01 to 1 by weight, based on the polymer. Stabilisers, plasticisers, pigments, lubricants, and the like may be added to the resultant polymer, either to the suspension, or preferably to the dried polymer. In addition, it is often useful to add an epoxy compound such as an epoxidised unsaturated oil. The invention is illustrated in the following Examples.Example I A number of vinyl chloride polymerisations were carried out using the following reactants at the indicated parts by weight Water 167 Vinyl chloride 100 Polyvinyl alcohol 0.17 degree ee of hydrolysis 70 80 degree of polymerisation 500 1500 Dilauryl peroxide 0.070 Sodium dihydrogen phosphate 0.10 In each case except one control , stearoyl benzoyl methane SBM was also present in the reactor charge in an amount selected to demonstrate the results achieved using from 0.001 to 0.04ieX by weight of vinyl chloride monomer. The reactants were charged into a closed reactor fitted with a reflux condenser, and polymerisation was carried out at a temperature of 72 C and pressure of 15 Atm. for a period of about 6 hours to achieve a monomer to polymer conversion of about 80 . The resulting polymer was then worked up into a formulation having the following composition Polyvinyl chloride 100 parts by weight Epoxidised soybean oil 5.0 parts by weight Acrylic impact improver 10.0 parts by weight Calcium zinc octoate stabiliser 0.2 parts by weight A 1 mm thick sheet of this compound was produced by milling, and the colour of the resultant sheet was assessed visually in comparison with the control.The results of that assessment are recorded on a qualitative scale in which the control is rated as 0, and the experimental samples awarded a varying number of indicative of their improved colour relative to the control.Thus the greater number of indications the better the prcdiict colour. The results of these evaluations are set out in Table 1. Table 1 SBM wt. on vinyl chloride Colour rating 0 control 0 0.001 o 0.005 0.010 0.025 3 0.040 4 A polymerisation carried out in a commercial plant in the presence of 0.010 wt. SBM confirmed the colour rating of the product as under commercial conditions. For the purposes of comparison, the above experimental procedure was repeated without including S3M in the polymerisation reaction mixture i.e. the control was repeated , but 0.010 wt. of SBM was blended into the vinyl chloride polymer during its subsequent processing.The colour rating of that material was only 0 in comparison with the achieved when the same amount of SBM was present during polymerisation, thereby demonstrating the greatly improved results achieved by the present invention. Example II A number of vinyl chloride polymerisations were carried out, and the polymer worked up into thin sheet and assessed for colour, following the recipes and procedures described in Example I, except that the stearoyl benzoyl methane stabiliser was replaced by a different acyl acetophenone stabiliser. In each case the stabiliser was incorporated into the reactor charge in an amount of 0.01 by weight of the vinyl chloride monomer. The results of these studies are set out in Table 2 below.
