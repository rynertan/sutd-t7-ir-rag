DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Fluorinated methyl ketimine magnesium halides are treated with a cyanide in the presence of a proton source to produce 2 fluorinated methyl aminoacetonitriles. The proton source and cyanide both can be provided by hydrogen cyanide. Alternatively, the reaction can be carried out using an alkali metal cyanide or ammonium cyanide and a proton source but care is required to control the acidity to prevent formation of the corresponding ketone. The process requires one equivalent of the cyanide and two equivalents of the proton source. Hydrogen cyanide by itself can serve as both the proton source and the cyanide source, provided two equivalents are employed. Alternatively, the cyanide source can be an alkali metal cyanide such as sodium cyanide or potassium cyanide , or ammonium cyanide, and the proton source can be any organic or inorganic substance of sufficient acidity to form the imine from the ketimine magnesium halide,Weak acids, such as a water soluble ammonium salt of a strong acid, are a preferred proton source. Ammonium chloride is especially preferred. Although strong organic or inorganic acids can be employed as the proton source, care must be taken to control the amount of acid to prevent or limit ketone formation arising from acid hydrolysis of the imine. Weak acids are preferred because hydrolysis of the imine to the corresponding ketone does not occur to any substantial extent and an excess of the weak acid can be used. The reaction medium can be any protic or aprotic inert solvent or mixture of such solvents. By inert solvent is meant a solvent which is capable of substantially dissolving the reactants and which is not deleterious to the formation of the desired product. An aqueous medium is preferred. By aqueous medium is meant either water substantially free of other solvents or water in the presence of other compatible miscible or immiscible solvents. A suitable protic solvent can also function as the proton source. The process can preferably be carried out at a temperature varying from about O C to room temperature and a reaction time of about 30 minutes to about one hour. The temperature and time are not critical. Other temperatures and times may be employed depending upon the particular reactants and or medium employed.

PREPARATION OF AMINOACETONITRILE DERIVATIVES FIELD OF INVENTION The invention relates to 2 fluorinated methyl aminoacetonitriles which are useful intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceutically active compounds especially 2 fluorinated methyl aminoacetic acid derivatives and provides a method of preparing said intermediates. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 2 Fluorinated methyl aminoacetonitriles are prepared by treating a corresponding fluorinated methyl ketimine magnesium halide with hydrogen cyanide or with an alkali metal cyanide or ammonium cyanide and a proton source. The aminoacetonitriles readily can be converted to the corresponding 2 fluorinated methyl aminoacetic acid derivatives. Said aminoacetic acid derivatives are useful compounds in that many have pharmacological or biological activity whilst others are intermediates in the preparation of compounds having pharmacological or other uses. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A number of classes of 2 fluorinated methyl amino,acetic acid derivatives have been reported to have useful pharmacological activity especially in the field of enzyme inhibition see, for example, UK PatentSpecifications Nos. 2001309A, 2001626A, 2001960A and 2005659A and European Patent Specification No.0000034A . Further, additional classes of 2 fluorinated methyl aminoacetic acid derivatives are the subject of various co pending UK and Foreign Patent Applications in the name of Merrell Toraude et Compagnie. It has been disclosed in USA Patent ApplicationNo. 33719 filed 26th April 1979 that certain of the monofluoromethyl aminoacetic acid derivatives disclosed in UK Patent Specification No. 2005659A can be prepared by acid hydrolysis of a corresponding monofluoromethyl benzyl ketimine magnesium halide, conversion of the resultant ketone to the corresponding aminoacetonitrile by a Strecker reaction using sodium cyanide and an ammonium salt such as ammonium chloride, and hydrolysis of the aminonitrile to the corresponding aminoacetic acid derivative. Surprisingly, it has now been found that said monofluoromethyl aminoacetonitriles can be prepared directly from the monofluoromethyl benzyl ketimine magnesium halides by treatment with hydrogen cyanide or EMI3.1 whetein p is 1 or 2 and R is EMI3.2 R2OCH2CH2CH2CH2 , R3CH2 , Hz CH2 CHCH2 C2 CHCH2CH2 , or CH3CH CHCH2CH2 wherein R1 is hydrogen, methoxy, bcnzyloxy, diphenyl methoxy, triphenylnethoxy, or allyloxy R2 is methyl, benzyl, diphenylmethyl, triphenyl methyl, or allyl and R3 is a substituted pllenyl group of the formula EMI4.1 the reaction medium is within the skill of the art. The ketimine salt can be a bromide, chloride or iodide but the chlorides and, especially, bromides are preferred. Having regard to the classes of pharmacologically active 2 fluorinated methyl aminoacetic acid derivatives referred to hereinbefore, it is preferred that the 2 fluorinated methyl group of the ketimine salt is a 2 monofluoromethyl or 2 difluoromethyl group. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided a process of preparing a 2 fluorinated methyl aminoacetonitrile of the following generalFormula I EMI5.1 Formula I wherein R represents an organic group which is inert under the process conditions and p represents 1 or 2 which comprise treating a ketimine magnesium halide of the following general Formula II EMI5.2 Formula II wherein R and p are as defined above and Z represents bromine, chlorine or iodine with,hydrogen cyanide or with an alkali metal cyanide or ammonium cyandie and a proton source. The organic group R can be, for example, an alkyl or alkenyl group optionally substituted by substituents which are inert under the process conditions. Examples of said substituents are alkoxy, eg methoxy phenylalkoxy, eg. benzyloxy, diphenylmethoxy and triphenylmethoxy alkenyloxy, eg allyloxy phenyl alkoxyphenyl, and benzyloxyphenyl, eg those alkoxyphenyl and benzyloxyphenyl groups specified in UK PatentSpecification No. 2005659A or European PatentApplication No. 0000034. In an especially preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided a process for preparing a compound of the formula EMI7.1 wherein p is 1 or 2 and R is EMI7.2 R2OCH2CH2CH2CH2 , R3CH2 CH2 CHCH2 ,CH2 CHCH2CH2 , or CH3CH CHCH2CH2 wherein R1 is hydrogen, methoxy, benzyloxy, diphenyl methoxy, triphenylmethoxy, or allyloxy R2 is methyl, benzyl, diphenylmethyl, triphenyl methyl, or allyl and R3 is a substituted phenyl group of the formula EMI8.1 EMI9.1 wherein R4 is C1 C8 alkyl, R5 is benzyl, and R6 is hydrogen or methyl with the proviso th it when R is R3CH2 wherein R3 isEMI9.2 p cannot be 2 which comprises treating a ketimine magnesium halide of the formula EMI9.3 wherein R and p have the meanings hereinabove defined and Z is chloride, bromide, or iodide with hydrogen cyanide or with an alkali metal cyanide or ammonium cyanide and a proton source. It is believed that the process procedes via formation of the corresponding imine of the formula EMI9.4 wherein R and p have the meanings herein above defined.The imine III can then form the corresponding irnrnonium ion which then reacts with the cyanide ion, or it can add hydrogen cyanide directly. Whatever the exact mechanism, the over all process can be depicted as shown below EMI9.5 The ketimine magnesium halides of Formula II can be made by reaction of a Grignard reagent of the formula RMgZ IV, wherein R and Z have the meanings hereinbefore defined, with fluoroacetonitrile CH2FCN or difluoroacetonitrile CHF2CN . The Grignard reagent IV can be made in known manner from the corresponding organohalide R Z by reaction with magnesium.The reaction of the Grignard reagent with fluoroacetonitrile or difluoroacetonitrile is carried out in a conventional manner in an aprotic solvent for example, tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether , at a temperature of from about 200 to 700C, preferably 200 to 400C. A reaction time of about 10 minutes to 12 hours preferably 10 minutes to one hour is employed. The ketimine magnesium halide formed by the reaction of the Grignard reagent with fluoroacetonitrile or difluoroacetonitrile need not be isolated from its reaction mixture. Conveniently, the reaction mixture containing the ketimine magnesium halide can be added directly to the reaction medium employed for preparation of the aminonitrile. Using this technique, whatever solvent is employed for preparing the ketimine magnesium halide will be incorporated into the medium utilized for preparation of the aminonitrile. A preferred method is to prepare the ketimine magnesium halide in tetrahydrofuran THF and to add the reaction mixture thus formed directly to a water solution of hydrogen cyanide or to an acidic water solution of an alkali metal cyanide or of ammonium cyanide. The use of ammonium chloride as the acid is particularly preferred. Using this technique it is preferable to employ a watermiscible solvent e.g. tetrahydrofuran for preparation of the ketimine magnesium halide but immiscible solvents, such as diethyl ether, can also be used. When difluoroacetonitrile is employed as the reactant for the formation of the ketimine magnesium halide from a benzylic Grignard reagent i.e. R3CH2MgX , a mixture of the desired ketimine salt and a ketimine salt side product formed by ortho attack by the EMI11.1 nitrile at the benzene ring X produced. The desired amino nitrile can be purified by conventional methods, such as chromatography. The organo halides R Z employed for preparing theGrignard reagents RMgZ are either known compounds or can be prepared by known methods, or obvious variations thereof, from known starting materials. The term alkyl when used herein means a saturated branched or straight chain hydrocarbon radical. Examples of C1 C8 alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, n propyl, i propyl, n butyl, i butyl, t butyl, n pentyl, n hexyl, n heptyl, and n octyl. Methyl is preferred. The fluorinated amino nitriles of Formula I are useful as intermediates for preparing various pharmacologically or biologically active fluorinated amino acid products When R in Formula I isEMI11.2 the products are the fluorinated trans dehydro ornithine derivatives ofFormula V EMI11.3 wherein p is l or 2. When R in Formula I is R2OCH2C2C f2 , the products are the fluorinated ornithine derivatives of Formula VI EMI11.4 wherein p is 1 or 2. When R in Formula I is CH2R3, the products are the fluorinated 2 amino 3 substituted phenyl propionic acid derivatives of Formula VII EMI12.1 wherein R7 is hydrogen or C1 C8 alkyl, p is 1 or 2, andX is Åa substituted phenyl group of the formula EMI12.2 EMI13.1 provided that when X isEMI13.2 p cannot be 2. When R in Formula I is R2OCH2CH2CH2CH2 , the products are the fluorinated lysine derivatives of Formula VIII EMI13.3 wherein p is 1 or 2. Ween R in Formula I isEMI13.4 the products are the tluorinated Y methylene ornithine derivatives ofFormula IX EMI14.1 wherein p is 1 or 2 or the fluorinated y oxo ornithine derivatives ofFormula X EMI14.2 wherein p is 1 or 2 . or the fluorinated histidine derivatives of Formula XI EMI14.3 wherein p is 1 or 2. When R in Formula I isEMI14.4 the products are the fluorinated 6 methylene ornithine derivatives ofFormula XII EMI14.5 wherein p is 1 or 2 or the B oxo fluorinated ornithine derivatives ofFormula XIII EMI14.6 wherein p is 1 or 2. When R in Formula I is CH2 CH CH2 , the products are the fluorinated y oxo ornithine derivatives of Formula X or the histidine derivatives of Formula XI, wherein p is 1 or 2. When R in Formula I is CH2 CHCH2CH2 orCH3CH CHCH2CH2 , the products are the alkyl fluorinated ornithine derivatives of Formula XIV or XIVb, respectively EMI15.1 wherein p is 1 or 2. The fluorinated trans dehydroornithine derivatives ofFormula V can be prepared using conventional procedures according to the reaction sequence Scheme A depicted below Scheme AEMI15.2 EMI15.3 In Scheme A, R1 is hydrogen, E is 1 or 2, NZ is the trifluoroacetamido group or the phthalimido group, or other suitable protecting group for a primary amine, andYN is the hexamethylenetetrammonium group or the phthalimido group. In the first step of Scheme A, the fluorinated aminonitrile intermediate 1 is treated with trifluoroacetic anhydride or phthaloyldichloride to form the N protected amino nitrile 2 , which then undergoes allylic bromination with N bromosuccinimide in the presence of benzoylperoxide to afford the bromo N protected aminonitrile 3 . Treatment of 3 with hexamethylenetetramine or an alkali metal phthalimide provides the correspondingN,N diprotected diamino nitrile derivative 4 which is heated with conc. hydrochloric acid at 1000C to simultaneously hydrolyze the nitrile group and remove the amino protecting groups, thus affording the final product V . The products of Formula VI can be prepared using conventional procedures according to the reaction sequence Scheme B depicted below Scheme BEMI16.1 EMI16.2 In Scheme B,R2 and p have the meanings hereinbefore defined, and PhtN or NPht means the phthalimido group, which has the following structural formula EMI17.1 In the first step of Scheme B, the fluorinated aminonitrile intermediate 6 is treated with phthaloyldichloride to form the N protected amino nitrile 7 . The alkoxy group OR2 of the N protected amino nitrile intermediate 7 is thenreplaced by iodine by conventional methods. In one method, the intermediate 7 is treated with three equivalents of trimethylsilyliodide TMSI which affords the iodo intermediate 8 directly.In another method, the intermediate 7 is treated with two equivalents of TMSI and water under which conditions the alkoxy group of intermediate 7 is cleaved to the corresponding free hydroxy group. The hydroxy intermediate thus formed is then treated with methanesulfonyl chloride to give the corresponding methanesulfonyloxy intermediate which upon treatment with sodium iodide provides the iodo intermediate 8 .Treatment of the iodo intermediate 8 with an alkali metal phthalimide gives the N,N diprotected diamino n nitrile 9 which is heated with concentrated mineral acid e.g. hydrochloric acid to simultaneously hydrolyze the nitrile group and remove the N protecting groups, thus affording the final product VI . The method of Scheme B can also be employed to prepare the fluorinated lysine derivatives of Formula VIII or the fluorinated ss methylene ornithine derivatives ofFormula XII using as starting materials for the reaction sequence the fluorinated amino nitriles of Formula 10 and 11 , respectively EMI18.1 wherein R2 and p have the meanings hereinbefore defined. A modification of the method depicted in Scheme B can be employed to prepare the fluorinated trans dehydro ornithine derivatives of Formula V or the y methylene derivatives of Formula IX from the respective fluorinated amino nitrile starting materials of Formula 12 and 13 , respectively EMI18.2 wherein Rs is methoxy, benzyloxy, diphenylmethoxy, triphenyloxy, or allyloxy, and p is 1 or 2. R is preferably methoxy. In this modification, instead of treating theN protected amino nitrile with TMSI, the N protected amino nitrile is treated with boron tribromide to form the corresponding bromo intermediate. The bromo intermediate is then used in place of the iodo intermediate in the reaction sequence of Scheme B to prepare theN,N diprotected diamino nitrile which is finally hydrolyzed to the desired product of Formula V or IX. The fluorinated y oxo ornithine derivatives ofFormula X can be prepared by conventional procedures according to the reaction sequence Scheme C depicted below Scheme CEMI19.1 In Scheme C, PhtN, NPht, and p have the meanings as employed in Scheme B. In the first step of Scheme C, the fluorinated aminonitrile 14 is treated with phthaloyldichloride to afford the N protected amino nitrile 15 . The N protected amino nitrile 15 is then brominated with N bromosuccinimide in the presence of benzoyl peroxide to give the bromo N protected amino nitrile 16 . Treatment with potassium phthalimide provides the N,N diprotected diamino nitrile 17 which is oxidized with ozone to afford the oxo intermediate 18 . Treatment of this intermediate with concentrated hydrochloric acid at 1000C removes both amino protecting groups and hydrolyzes the nitrile function to give the desired fluorinated y oxo ornithine derivative X . The fluorinated y oxo ornithine derivatives ofFormula X can also be prepared by the reaction sequence Scheme D shown below Scheme DEMI20.1 In Scheme D, PhtN, NPht, and E have the meanings as employed in Scheme B. In the first step of Scheme D, the fluorinated aminonitrile 19 undergoes acid hydrolysis to give the corresponding fluorinated amino acid 20 which is then esterified to give the amino acid ester 21 . Treatment of the ester 21 with phthaloyldichloride gives the N prbtected amino acid ester 22 . Reaction of the Nprotected amino acid ester 22 with potassium permanganate oxidizes the double bond and provides the N protected amino diacid half ester 23 which is converted to the correponding acid chloride 24 using thionyl chlorideReaction of the acid chloride 24 with diazomethane yields the corresponding diazoketone 25 , which upon reaction with hydrogen bromide, gives the corresponding N protected d bromo y oxo amino acid ester 26 . Reaction of this intermediate with potassium phthalimide forms the N,N diprotected y oxo ornithine ester 27 .Treatment of the ester 27 with hydrochloric acid at 1000C removes the amino protecting groups and hydrolyzes the ester function to give the desired fluorinated y oxo ornithine derivative X . As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the first two steps in the reaction sequence of Scheme D subsequent can be omitted. During the reaCtion sequence, the nitrile function remains intact up to the final step where it rather than the ester function is hydrolyzed to generate the carboxylic acid function. The fluorinated y keto ornithine derivatives of Formula X can be converted to the fluorinated histidine derivative of Formula XI in two steps. The first step entails reaction with potassium thiocyanate to torm the imidizole 28 EMI21.1 wherein p has the meaning hereinbefore defined. In the second step, the imidazole 28 is treated with ferric chloride, which removes the SH group to afford the desired product X . The compounds of Formula XIva or XIVb can be prepared by treating the amino nitriles of Formula 29 and 30 , respectively EMI22.1 with concentrated hydrochloric acid at 1000C. The products of Formula VII wherein R is hydrogen, in general, can be prepared in knovzn manner by direct acid hydrolysis of the amino nitrile intermediate of Formula I wherein R is the group R3CH2 . The amino nitrile intermediate can be hydrolyzed in one step or stepwise to give the corresponding amino acid product. In a onestep process the hydrolysis can be performed using a concentratea acid, such as hydrogen bromide at 800C to 1250C for about 0.5 to 24 hours, under which conditions hydrolysis of the nitrile function is also accompanied by cleavage of the alkoxy groups present in the phenyl ring.In a step wise process the amino nitrile intermediate is treated with a lower alcohol e.g. methanol or ethanol saturated with anhydrous hydrogen chloride for 1 to 24 hours, preferably 10 hours, at about 0 to 500C, preferably 250C, to give the corresponding amino acid amide, which can then be hydrolyzed to the amino acid by treatment with 50 aqueous sulfuric acid for about 2 to 6 hours at about 600 to 1000C, preferably 95 C. Excess sulfuric acid must be removed. Following formation of the amino acid, the alkoxy group can be removed by treatment with concentrated hydrobromic acid at elevated temperatures such as hereinbefore described to give the final product. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art, that when it is desired to prepare a product of Formula VII in which the phenyl moiety contains an alkoxy group and a hydroxy group, an intermediate of Formula I wherein R is EMI23.1 wherein R4 is C1 C8 alkyl and R5 is benzyl or trimethylsilyl, must be employed since the benzyloxy cr trimethylsilyloxy group OR5 can be cleaved preferentially in the presence of the alkoxy group OR4 . Using this method the nitile group is hydrolyzed and the benzyl or trimethyl silyl group is cleaved under conditions which do not affect the alkoxy group OR4 .Conditions for carrying out such selective transformations are known in the art When it is desired to prepare a compound of Formula VII wherein R7 is Cl C8 alkyl, the corresponding carboxylic acid R7 is hydrogen can be esterified by conventional methods, such as by treating the acid with an alkonol saturated with hydrogen chloride. The methyl esters are preferred. The fluorinated ornithine derivatives of Formula VI, the fluorinated lysine derivatives of Formula VIII, the fluorinated trans dehydroornithine derivatives of Formula V, the fluorinated B oxo ornithine derivatives of Formula XIII, the fluorinated ss methylene ornithine derivatives of Formula XII, the fluorinated y oxo ornithine derivatives of Formula X, the fluorinated y methylene ornithine derivatives of Formula IX, and the fluorinated 6 alkyl ornithine derivatives of Formula XIVa and XIVb produce irreversible inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase enzyme ODC in vivo, and can be used systemically in general to decrease putrescine, spermidine, and or spermine concentrations in cells undergoing rapid growth or proliferation .Because putrescine , spermidine, and or spermine concentrations are decreased, the administration of a compound of Formula V, VI, VIII, IX, X, XII, XIII, XIV or XIVb a b provides a method for controlling undesirable cell growth or proliferation in mammals. The compounds are useful pharmacological agents for treating those diseases or conditions that are known in the art to be characterized by rapid cell growth or proliferation associated with high ODC activity In particular, the compounds are useful systemically for controlling the growth of tumor tissues in mammals and for controlling the growth of pathogenic parasitic protozoa in infected domestic animals and humans.The compounds can also be employed to study the presence and physiological function of ODC inhibition in biological system and its relationship to pathologieal processes. The compounds of Formula VII produce irreversible inhibition of AADC enzyme in vivo and are, in particular, useful for the treatment of Parkinson s syndrome when administered in combination with exogenous dopa, in particular L dopa. The co administration of a compound of Formula VII with L dopa potentiates the effect ofL dopa and thereby provides effective therapy ofParkinsonism using substantially lower doses of L dopa resulting in a decrease in side effects. The compounds of Formula VII potentiate L dopa by preventing its peripheral decarboxylation to dopamine, thereby increasing the circulating amount of exogenous L dopa available for absorption into the brain and subsequent conversion there to dopamine. The compounds of Formula XI produce irreversible inhibition of histidine decarboxylase in vivo, and can be used in general to block histimine biosynthesis in mammals. The compounds of Formula XI are useful pharmacological agents for decreasing the concentrations of histamine in mammals and for the treatment of diseases or conditions characterized by excessive histamine levels.For example, the compounds can be employed for treating allergic conditions and gastric hypersecretory states.The compounds of Formula XI are described in BelgianPatent No. 869,322 granted August 14, 1978.
