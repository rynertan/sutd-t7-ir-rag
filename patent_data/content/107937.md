# Puzzle.

## Abstract
A puzzle comprises a cube 11 having translucent faces and a plurality of light sources 46, 55 one behind each face to cause illumination as the cube is turned about axes normal to the faces. Gravity sensitive or orientation sensitive switches 47, 48 such as mercury switches, are connected to an electronic circuit 57, 58, 59, 60 acting to compare the switching states and switching movements of the switches with a preprogrammed sequence to determine whether and which of the lamps 46, 55 to illuminate. In use of the puzzle the faces will light up when a predetermined sequence of rotations about three orthogonal axes is performed correctly to match the switching sequences with the stored sequence.
