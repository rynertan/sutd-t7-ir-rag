# AC motor control method and arrangement.

## Abstract
A method and arrangement for controlling an AC motor which exhibits a constant torque characteristic at a rotational speed N below a base speed Nb and a constant output characteristic at a rotational speed N above the base speed Nb, the method which is utilised by the ar rangement comprising the steps of finding a base speed N after limiting the output power of the AC motor, N being derived from the base speed Nb and the ratio η be tween maximum output power Pmax₁ and maximum output power Pmax₂ before and after the output power of the AC motor is limited, respectively, rendering the slip fre quency of the AC motor constant until the rotational speed N of the AC motor reaches the base speed N, varying the slip frequency in inverse proportion to the rotational speed N for N between N and Nb N N Nb and varying the slip frequency in proportion to the rota tional speed N for N above Nb Nb N , whereby the output power of the AC motor is rendered constant at a rotational speed N above N.
