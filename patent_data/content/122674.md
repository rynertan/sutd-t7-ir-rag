# Semiconductor device for producing or amplifying electro magnetic radiation and method of manufacturing same.

## Abstract
Semiconductor device for producing or amplifying elec tromagnetic radiation, more particularly a semiconductor laser, having a substrate 1 which has a mesa shaped raised portion 3 . On either side of the mesa 3 there is located a blocking layer 14 of a conductivity type opposite to that of the substrate. On the blocking layer 14 are formed a first passive layer 6 of the same conductivity type as the subs trate, an active layer 8 and a second passive layer 9 of a conductivity type opposite to that of the substrate 1 . Accord ing to the invention, the blocking layer 14 extends also over the mesa 3 , which is connected by diffusion from at least the first passive layer 6 to the blocking layer.
