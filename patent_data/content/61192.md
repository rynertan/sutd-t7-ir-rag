# A sustained vapor releasing body having excellent shape retainability.

## Abstract
The invention provides a novel integrated body of an elongated form capable of sustainedly releasing vapor of a vaporizable substance contained in the body into the atmos phere, such as an aromatic compound, pesticide, fungicide and a sex pheromone as a means for the control of a pest. The inventive sustainedly vapor releasing integrated body is very advantageous in the high efficiency of shaping into desired configuration and setting or installation in the field in large numbers by virtue of the good shape retainability as a result of the integrated structure composed of a capillary tubing of a polymeric material filled with the vaporizable substance and a metal wire with plastic deformability and a sufficiently large cross section and integrated side by side with the capillary tubing to retain the latter in the compulsori ly deformed disposition. The inventive integrated bodies are suitable for mass production in a relatively simple process.
