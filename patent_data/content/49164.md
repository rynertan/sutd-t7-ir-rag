# Optical system.

## Abstract
A raster scanner 10 with laser 22 for generating a scanning beam 32 and compact, folded optical system 24, 30, 33, 36, 47 for transmitting the beam to an object 12 to be scanned. The optical system includes a first mirror 24 for guiding the laser beam to a modulator 27 , a second mirror 30 beyond the modulator for intercepting the beam from the modulator and guiding it to a mirror 33 which guides the beam to the mirrored facets of a rotary polygon 35 , the polygon scanning the beam through a preset scan arc and returning the beam via a focusing lens 45 to the third mirror, the third mirror reflecting the beam onto a fourth mirror 47 guiding the beam to the object 12 .
