# MULTILAYER INTERCONNECT CIRCUITRY USING PHOTOIMAGEABLE DIELECTRIC

## Abstract
A method of fabricating multilayer printed circuit boards using polymer thick film technology is disclosed which lutilizes photoimageable dielectric material between conduc tive polymer thick film layers and which is capable of producing extremely small and uniformly sized vias.
