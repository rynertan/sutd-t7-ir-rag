# PROGRAMMABLE TIMING PULSE GENERATOR

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to a programmable timing pulse generator which employs a memory in which plurality different sequences of timing signals can be stored, which sequences can be programmably accessed to achieve any set of timing signals as might be required by the system. This readily allows the circuit designer to create a system in which certain timing signals may be required at particular intervals but not at regular intervals, and also allows the designer to create a system in which the rate at which the timing signals are generated can be readily changed by merely accessing a different portion of the memory in which the timing signals are stored.
