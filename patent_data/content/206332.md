# APPARATUS FOR GENERATING HIGH PRESSURE BY UNDERWATER SHOCK WAVE

## Abstract
There is disclosed an apparatus for generating a high pressure by underwater shock wave of the type that it is pro vided with a shock wave generation chamber 1 of which an inner surface is formed into a shape of a part of a pseudo el lipsoid of rotation and which is to be filled with liquid and a shock wave generation source 3, 4, 5 for generating shock wave at a first focus 2 of the pseudo ellipsoid so that a high pressure may be applied by the shock wave to an object set in position at a second focus 9 of the pseudo ellipsoid of rotation. To avoid contamination and other damage of said object the shock wave generation source comprises a laser means 5 , an optical fiber member 4 and a focusing lens 3 for focusing a laser beam on the foregoing focus posi tion 2 .
