# Optically active polymers of methacrylate esters.

## Abstract
A new organic polymer useful for the optical resolution or solvent fractionation is provided. The organic polymer is a homopolymer or copolymer comprising mainly a specific methacrylate ester constitutional unit and having or optical rotation and, therefore, an optical activity.
