# APPARATUS FOR STORING AND RETRIEVING DATA STORAGE DEVICES

## Abstract
A floppy disk drive 10 includes a disk pack 16 storing a plurality of floppy diskettes and mounted piv otally on pivots 34 , a driver mechanism 70 for ro tating any one of the diskettes into a retrievable position, a picker mechanism 20 for moving the one diskette between the retrievable position and an ope rative position at which the diskette is rotatable on a spindle 22 , and a position control circuit 24 for controlling the position of a recording head 28 across the one diskette being in the operative position and for compensating for expansion, contraction, and eccentric rotation of the one diskette. The floppy diskettes are stored bent in the disk pack 16 , but in the operative position the one diskette that had been retrieved from the retrievable position is stored only partially in the disk pack and parallel to the plane of rotation. A micro processor controls the entire disk drive.
