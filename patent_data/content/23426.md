# Buckles for harnesses.

## Abstract
A buckle for a safety harness consists of two identical parts. Each part comprises a plate 10 having a D shaped aperture 12 in one end, for receiving a harness, and a por tion 14 at the other end folded at right angles to the rest of the plate 10 along an oblique fold line 16 . A slot 18 extends half way along the fold line 16. A second plate 20 has a tab 22 welded to the portion 14 of the plate 10 at the side thereof adjacent to the slot 18 . The two parts interlock with the upstanding portions 14 and 22 of one part pro jecting through the slot 18 in the other and vice versa. Ten sion applied to a harness connected to the apertures 12 tends to draw the ends 24 of the slots 18 into abutment with each other.
