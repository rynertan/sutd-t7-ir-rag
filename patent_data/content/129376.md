# Thermoplastic composition of copolymers.

## Abstract
A thermoplastic resin composition of high heat resistance and high impact resistance comprises A 50 to 90 by weight of a copolymer prepared by copolymerization of 10 to 35 by weight of acrylonitrile, 60 to 85 by weight of a monomer mixture of 2 isopropenylnaphthalene 2 IPN and α methylstyrene α MeSt , the proportion of 2 IPN being 5 to 70 by weight based on the total weight of 2 IPN and α MeSt, and 0 to less than 10 by weight of a vinyl monomer copolymerizable with the foregoing monomers and B 10 to 50 by weight of a graft copolymer prepared by polymerizing 15 to 50 parts by weight of at least one monomer selected from aromatic vinyl compounds, vinyl cyanides, methacrylic acid alkyl esters, and acrylic acid alkyl esters in the presence of 50 to 85 parts by weight of a butadiene or alkyl acrylate based rubber, the sum of the graft and rubber components being 100 parts by weight.
