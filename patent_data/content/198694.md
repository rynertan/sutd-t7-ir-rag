# Clutch control system for a continuously variable transmission.

## Abstract
A clutch control system for a continuously variable transmission 25 includes a mode determination system which samples input signals including position of the neutral drive selector 52 , driver demand 45 , engine speed 60 , vehicle speed 58 , and clutch input speed 61 . From these signals the operating mode is determined and the clutch control system operating mode is set. In starting the vehicle, a minor pressure feedback loop and a major engine speed feedback loop are used. When the clutch is locked up, these control loops are not employed in regulating the vehicle operation.
