## Description
The present invention relates to an instantaneously heated coffee machine, provided with one or more dispensing assemblies, and ef festive to be associated in more units and coupled to a coffee milling device, As it is known, there are presently made coffee machines, of the automatically heated type, provided with a dispensing assembly, and which are used, in addition to home enviromments, in offices, communities and the like. The mentioned instantaneously heated coffee machines,as it should be apparent, are effective to meet only limited needs thereby, under large coffee demand oonditions, they are to be replaced by other coffee machines, of the steam accumulating type, provided with a greater number of dispensing assemblies and of very high cost. Moreover, with the mentioned coffee machines, there is usually associated a coffee mill, which, conventionally, represents an individual apparatus, having an inverted frustum of cone shape, trged on a suitable supporting.upr.ight. That coffee mill, as it should be apparent, because of its specifically designed struc tare, is not effective to neatly combine with the design of the coffee machine and, accordingly, is held as a separate unit from the latter. Accordingly, the task of the present invention is to provide a coffee machine, of the instantaneously heated type, and hence of reduced cost, and a coffee milling device, which are effective to be easily used in two or more units to be mutually coupled, in such a way to provide a coffee machine including any desired numbers of coffee dispensing assemblies. Within that task, it is an object of the present invention to provide a coffee mill, including a coffee powder metering device, which is effective to substantially form an integral body with the coffee machine, to facilitate the loading of the filters. According to one aspect of the present invention, the above task and object, as well as yet other objects, which will become more apparent thereinafter, are achieved by an instantaneously heated coffee machine, and a coffeemill including a built. in coffee powder metering device, characterized in that they form a modular structure, of substantially parallelepipedal shape, having planar side walls of like size, in such a way as tob Eective to be coupled in an adjoining relationship in a plurality of units depending on the user needs. Further characteristics and advantages of the instantaneously heated coffee machine, and of the coffee mill including a built in coffee powder metering device, according to the present invention, will become more apparent thereinafter, with reference to the several figures of the accompanying drawings, where Fig. 1 is a perspective view illustrating the coffee mill including a coffee powder metering device according to the invention Fig. 2 illustrates the coffee machine, provided with a single dispensing assembly, which may be provided with a small metering drawer Fig. 3 is an exploded detail view illustrating the coffee machine of Fig. 2 Fig. 4 illustrates a coffee machine provided with two dispensing assemblies, and which may be moreover provided with a coffee waste holding small drawer Fig. 5 is an exploded view illustrating the coffee machine of Fig. 4 Figs. 6 and 7 illustrate a coffee machine including three coffee dispensing assemblies or units and Figs. 8, 9 and 10 illustrate, schematically and from the top, some possible practical arrangements of the above mentioned instantaneously heated coffee machines and coffee mills. With reference to the Figures of the accompabying drawings, the coffee mill 1 and coffee machine 2 according to the invention are arranged in housings or casings of substantially parallelepipedal shape, having a different width and side walls of like size, in height and depth. That approach affords the possibility of associating to a single coffee mill one or more coffee machines, while providing a compact structure susceptible to be easily modified as the needs change. More specifically, the instantaneously heated coffee machine may be provided with one or more dispensing assemblies or units 3, including a related steam duct 4, as arranged at the bottom of a cantilevered parallelepipedal body 5 including suitable driving and control means. It should be noted that, for each dispensing assembly or unit, the coffee machine is provided with a vibration type of pump 20, including a sucking duct 21 communicating with a tank 22, The pump 20 is coupled, through a supplying duct 23, to a heating chamber 24, which is provided with a supplying valve 25 to adjust the inlet of the heated water supplied onto the coffee powder contained in the inter exchangeable cup 26 housed in the filter holder 21. Moreover, the coffee machine may be provided, at its bottom 9, with an exhausted coffee holding drawer 10. The coffee mill, in turn, has its operative members included in a cantilever parallelepipedal body 6 thereunder there are provided a metering element 11 and a fork shaped member l to support the filters of the metering assemblies, during the filling therein of the milled coffee powder. From the above disclosure it should be noted that the invention fully achieves the intended objects, and, in particular, it is to be pointed out that the provision of a coffee machine including a number of dispensing assemplies, each whereof provided with an individual tank, supplying pump and independent heating assembly, af fords the possibility of obtaining a coffee machine of high output while providing a constructionally simple coffee machine. While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been disclosed andillustrated, it should be noted that it is susceptible to many modifications and variations, all of which come within the scope of the invention. In practicing the invention all of the details may be replaced by other technically equivalent elements.
