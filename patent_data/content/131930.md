# Semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
In the semiconductor memory device according to the present invention, when there is a defective portion in the memory cells 7 1 to 7 256 , those memory cels are substi tuted by redundancy memory cells 17 1, 17 2 . When defec tive portions were discovered in the memory cells 7 1 to 7 256 , the fuse elements FS 1 to FS 256 corresponding to the memory cells 7 1 to 7 256 having the defective portions are cut off. Voltages of the select lines 5 1 to 5 256 connected to the memory cells having the defective portions are held at L level by the resistors R 1 to R 256 . Due to this, the memory cells 7 1 to 7 256 having the defective portions are not selec ted.
