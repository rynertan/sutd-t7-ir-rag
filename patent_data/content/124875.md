# Battery having an electrode made of a polymeric compound with conjugated double bonds.

## Abstract
A battery having electrodes, at least one of which is made of a polymeric compound having conjugated double bonds in the main chain, is described. The organic solvent of an elec trolytic solution in the battery is selected from nitrile com pounds of the formulae I and II R CN I wherein R is a C2 7 alkyl, a saturated alicyclic C3 7 hyd rocarbon residue, CH₃ CH₂
