# HORIZONTAL TYPE CONTINUOUS CASTING MACHINE FOR CASTING MOLTEN METAL INTO A PLURALITY OF CAST METAL STRANDS

## Abstract
A horizontal type continuous casting machine for casting molten metal into a plurality of cast metal strands, which comprises a tundish 1 for receiving molten metal a plurality of horizontal molds 3 each fitted, through a respective horizontal nozzle 2 , to each of a plurality openings provided in a lower portion of a side wall of the tundish 1 , the molds 3 being arranged in parallel with each other in the same horizontal level a water cooling means comprising a single jacket 12 , for simultaneously cooling the plurality of molds 3 to solidify molten metal introduction from the tundish 1 through the nozzles 2 into the molds 3 into a plurality of cast metal strands 7 at least one pair of horizontal pinch rolls 13 each comprising an upper roll 13a and a lower roll 13b , for simultaneously squeezing the plurality of case metal strands 7 and simul taneously withdrawing same in the horizontal direction from the molds 3 and at least one horizontal guide roller 14 for simultaneously supporting and guiding the plurality of cast metal strands 7 from the molds 3 toward the pair of pinch rolls 13 .
