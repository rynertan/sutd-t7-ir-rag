# Tape transport system.

## Abstract
A capstan driven web system having a take up reel and a supply reel, the tape being drawn from the supply reel by a tape driven capstan arrangement. The drawn tape is col lected on the take up reel which is mechanically coupled to the supply reel by a mechanism having a variable transfer ratio. In one embodiment, the variable ratio transport system is formed of a belt drive system having variable diameter pulleys coupled to each of the tape reels. The transfer ratio of the variable diameter pulley system is controlled by a servo mechanism which selects an appropriate transfer ratio in response to the position of a servo arm which senses the tension of the tape.
