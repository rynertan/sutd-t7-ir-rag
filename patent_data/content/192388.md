# SUPPORT ASSEMBLY FOR CELLS OF A SECONDARY BATTERY

## Abstract
A secondary battery, such as a nickel hydrogen NiHâ‚‚ cell, has a first and a second cell stack 11, 12 each cantile vered from opposite sides of a weld ring 25 . The weld ring 25 is located at the approximate centre or middle of a press ure vessel 10 composed of two half sections 10a, 10b which are welded to opposite sides of the weld ring. The cell stacks are essentially unsupported at their outer ends. Electrical cur rent carriers 16, 17 are received in longitudinal channels 28a, 28b formed on opposite sides of an axially located cell stack support member 24 , on which the cell elements are captured. Cantilever mounting of two cell stacks from a cen tral weld ring is found to improve the integrating and durabil ity of the cell. It also increases the energy capacity of the battery through the ability to add more cells through the use of axially longer pressure vessels, increasing the capacity of the battery. Location of the weld ring between the pair of cell stacks improves heat transfer between the pair of cell stacks improves heat transfer between the cells and the pressure vessel during discharge.
