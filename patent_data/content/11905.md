The 3 owe plate 20 hae wider porions 93rear its erds ses Figure 4 . each having a semi circuler shape the rea, with respect to the inended direction 99 of oparative travel of the machine. The radius of this soun e el corresponds sabstantially to the diameter of the gear box AH containing the pinions 70, 69 and 74.The ra arthe curved part of the wider portion 93 also orres es st tially with the radius of the lower Alth Figure 4 showe che cutter tecth 61 of the membeu 46 and 47 to be ekactly located one above the other, the cutting members 46 and 47 may alternatively be arranged se cout the teeth of one cutting member are of f set relatively to the teeth of the other cutting member in the position of the eccentric arms 66 and 71 illustated in Figure 4. The width of each cutting member 46 and 47 is about 25 mms.The cutting members 46 and 47 made from steel band having a thickness 97 of about i mms The lengtn 98 of the cutting members is about 1600 mms. The length 98 exceeds 100 times the thichiese 97.The machine operates as follows Per mowing standing crop, the machine 1 is bitoned to the lift 12 of a tractor or a similar vehicle. The shaft 89 is coupled to the power take off shaft of the mracror so that via the belt or rope 87 and the pull vs 89 and 88 the shaft 85 is driven. Fom the shaft 85 the criving sht 34 for the. drum 92 and the cutting members 48 an 47 is driven as is the shaft 82 fo driving the drom 9 through the bevel gear wheels 83 and 84. The drums 91 and 98 are thus rotated and the cutting members 46 and 47 are esused te reciprosere.The reciprocatory movemen of the cutfung mempers 46 and 47 is permitted by the conneewion of the carriers 40 and 41 to the plates 20 and 21 by the rods 42 and 43, and is caused by the eccentrie mecnamisms 67 and 72 Tn movement takes place in G direction parallel to the length of the cutting members 46 and 47 and the plates 20 and 21, i.s. in the direction of the arrow 94.The eccentrie mechanisms 67 and 72 are designed sothat the reciprocatory movement of the outting members 46 and 47 with the carriers 40 and 41 has a strcke of less than 30 mms The drive is sucX that the frequency of the recip rocatory movement is at least 2000 strokes a minute in this emhodiment the frequency is about 6000 strokes a minute so that the cutting members are vibratung during the operation of the mower.Owing to this parooatery movement th eop can be rapidly cut with a ergt comsump The crop is cut by the cutting edgst of the teeth 61 of the cutting members 46 and 47 moving in relatively opposite directions and operating like scissors.The cutter members 46 and 47 are caused to reciprocate by the eccentric mechanisms 67 and 72 in a manner such that they always rove in mutually opposite directions so that the forces produces by the reciprocatory movements of t 2c two members balance one another.During a normal run in the direction 99, crop cut by the cutting members 46 and 47 is conducted across the tor of tbe plate 21 t the rear. The crop cwt near the end of the cutting members 46 anct 47 will be caught bytie 91 a 90. The directions of rotation of the drus 91 sjd LS f is such that, with respect to the direction 99, the facing isgt of the drums move to the rear.Therefore, the gr ont near the ends of the cutting members will l bc alspiaced by the drums 91 and 92 inwardly of the cutting members andwill be delivered between the drums 91 and o . the cut crop is deposited in the form of a swath, which is spaced apart from other swaths already formed and er from adjacent areas of crop not yet cut During the reciprocatory movement, the carriers 40 and are supported on their top and bottom surfaces respect vely by the plates 20 and 21, along which they will slice.The contacting surfaces of the carriers and of the contacting cuting members 46 and 47 slide one along the other see Figures 6, 7 and 8 . The carriers 40 and 41, with the cutting members 46 and 47, are capable of deflecting with respecttr the plates 20 and 21 in a direction parallel to tes nomral direction 94 of reciprocation,This deflection of the carrlers 40 and 41 with the cutting members 46 and 47 is allowed by sliding of the arms 42 and 43 in the suppoting blocks 44, and takes place against thr,., resilient action of the springs 39. If an obstarls lying on the ground ls encountered, the cutting memoers can thus deflect to the rear with respect to the f tion 99.The maximum deflection is such that he cutting members 46 and 47 with the carriers 40 and 41 can antly over a distance at least equal to the dis the tips 61 of the cutting members 41 a erenect bayund he front edges of the frame s 2 l us the cutting members 46 and 47 c be retraste tletely in to the space formed be t cen the plate and 21 so as to avoid damage to the cutter tee of the cutting members by obstacles such as stoses ing on the ground. The plates 20 and 21 construte u addition, guides for the carriers 40 and 41Wlen del ting to the rear, the cutting members 46 andAn a se st tolly supported at the rear ends of the recesses 48 ard 49. The springs 43 and the stops on a arms 42 and 43 tend to hold the cutting men t s css on such that theeth 61 are located srbste ald conplet ly beyond the front edge of the i pl 20 ard 21.The pressure of the springe 1 am . f desired, be adjustable au order to co pressure an which the cui ere will defl . S . s 42 and 43 extend at least substantially the dire tion 99 and are slidable lengthwise . b ochs , the direction of deflecftion of the cl ting si and 47 is such thant at least the thereof is parallel t t e direction 99. suting members 46 and 47 can be readily removed from le 40 ard 41. Te this end if is cnly necessary pe apl er th like through the slots 57, into theHeïes 55 and 55 enert a force in the direction of the arrm 9 the cutting members 46 and 47. This fores nead no be in order to overcome the retaining force of the denents in t e form of the balle 52 and the spring p die esses 50 allow the cutting rembers to be re ei the catching pins 51 im the carrisrz 40 and 41 wuthout the need for further means. This easy removal of the li ng members is advantageoes, for example, g the cutting members. The cutting members can be readil inserted into the holäers by the reverse ed e ete ing pins 51 and the SSth 50 a st ry connecion of each t g ahe
