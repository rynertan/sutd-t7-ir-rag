# Miscible polymer blends containing poly 2 oxazoline .

## Abstract
Miscible blends of poly 2 oxazolines and thermoplastic polymers are disclosed herein, These blends exhibit a sin gle glass transition point indicative of a miscible blend. The blends of this invention are useful as membranes, par ticularly separation membranes for mixtures of organic compounds or organic compounds and water and a perevaporation process.
