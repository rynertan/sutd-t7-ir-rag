# Enhanced bulk porosity of polymer structures via plasma technology.

## Abstract
A porous article is prepared by subjecting a substan tially non porous polymeric shaped article containing from about 1.0 30 of plasticizer to a plasma treatment under conditions such that the plasticizer is volatilized or decom posed into gaseous decomposition products thereby creat ing an internal pore structure while leaving the surface of the article essentially intact and free from microscopically visible pores.
