# ZOOM LENS HAVING BARREL COMPONENTS WHICH CAN BE MOULDED FROM PLASTICS MATERIAL

## Abstract
A zoom barrel 3 surrounds and is rotatable relative to a fixed main barrel 2 to vary the focal length of the zoom lens. Such rotation of the zoom barrel 3 causes a variator lens group 8a supported by a moving barrel 8 and a compensator lens group 6a supported by a sleeves to move axially relative to the main barrel 2. The sleeve 5 is provided with pins 7 which are slidably received in respective guide grooves 3a in the zoom barrel 3, arcuate guide grooves 5b which slidably receive respective pins 8 on the main barrel 2, and axial guide slots 5c which slidably receive respective tab portions 10 on the moving barrel 8. Each groove 5b is axially interposed between a respective one of the pins 7 and a respective one of the guide slots 5c, with the centres of these parts posed on a common straight line parallel to the optical axis â„“.
