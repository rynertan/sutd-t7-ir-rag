# GAS FED POROUS ELECTRODE FOR USE IN VERTICAL PLANE IN ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL OR ELECTROLYTIC CELL

## Abstract
A porous gas fed electrode 14 adapted to operate in a large capacity cell 10 with a stable three phase interface in the electrode thereby avoiding the problems of gas percola tion can be readily achieved in a simple and inexpensive manner by the provision of a porous hydrophilic layer 21 on the surface of the electrode which is in contact with the aqueous electrolyte 17 . Due to the high capillary pressure exhibited by liquids in hydrophilic pores, very high gas pressures are required to force the gas through the structure and the loss of gas into the electrolyte is thereby eliminated. In addition, a gas pressure in the gas compartment 23 of the electrochemical cell employing such an electrode can be raised to balance the electrolyte pressure at the bottom of the electrode thereby effectively preventing electrolyte seep age into the gas compartment.
