## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO ORGANOTIN COMPOUNDS, GEL CATALYST COMPOSITIONS AND METHOD FOR PREPARING FLEXIBLE POLYURETHANE FOAM This invention relates to the preparation of polyurethane foams. This invention further relates to the use of certain gel catalyst compositions to prepare polyurethane foams exhibiting high levels of oxidative stability relative to products obtained using conventional organotin catalysts or combinations of these organotin catalysts with compounds containing phosphorus and halogen.Certain of these catalyst compositions are novel and constitute part of this invention. Flexible polyurethane foams are widely used in the manufacture of furniture, particularly seat cushions, and as packaging material for delicate instruments and other articles that are susceptible to damage during handling and transit. If the foam is incorporated into a piece of furniture or other durable product, the foam must withstand exposure of several years or longer to elevated temperatures, atmospheric oxygen, or both without undergoing significant degradation, resulting in a gradual loss of resiliency and structural strength which may culminate in disintegration of the foam. It is well known to prepare flexible cellular polyurethanes by reacting polyols containing two or more reactive hydrogen atoms, as determined by the Zerewitinoff method, with polyfunctional isocyanates in the presence of a polymerization or gel catalyst and a blowing agent such as water or a relatively low boiling fluorocarbon. A surfactant is often included in the reaction mixture together with a blowing catalyst to obtain the desired uniformly small cell size within the foam when water is used as the blowing agent. Fillers such as bart tes and various additives such as flame retardants can also be present in the formulation employed to prepare the foam. U. S. Patent 3,620,985 discloses that organotin compounds are effective gel catalysts for cellular poly urethanes. Compounds of the formula RaSnX4 a wherein R is typically butyl or other alkyl radical containing from l to 20 carbon atoms and X is a halogen or other anionic radical are generally less than satisfactory for preparing flexible foams that are exposed to atmospheric oxygen, elevated temperature, i.e. above about 500C, or both over extended periods of time. Under these conditions the foams may lose resiliency and structural integrity, sometimes to the extent that they disintegrate when compressed. This is particularly true of those foams derived from polyethercontaining polyols that are derived at least in part from propylene oxide.These polyols may also contain ester linkages, OOCRCOO , and end groups derived from ethylene oxide to obtain hydroxyl groups bonded to primary rather than secondary carbon atoms. High resiliency polyurethane foams prepared from polyols that contain side chains obtained by the graft polymerization of acrylonitrile, styrene or other vinyl monomer onto a poly propylene oxide backbone are usually less susceptible to oxidative and thermal degradation. However, in the presence of conventional organotin gel catalysts even these products undergo a significant decrease in structural strength and become brittle following prolonged exposure to oxygen and or heat. The resistance of flexible polyurethane foams based on polyether containing polyols to oxidatively and thermally induced degradation can be improved by employing compounds containing phosphorus and a halogen in combination with the organotin gel catalyst. Catalyst compositions of this type are disclosed in United States Patents 3,067,149 4,048,100 v4,052,346 and British Patent 1,003,201.This type of catalyst composition may be suitable for certain applications where resiliency is not a requirement, since foams prepared using these catalyst compositions typically recover only a small fraction of their original height within 30 minutes after being compressed to 10 of their original height for 22 hours at a temperature of 70 C, a conventional method for determining resiliency and dry heat stability of flexible polyurethane foams. An objective of this invention is to improve the resiliency and dry heat stability of flexible polyurethane foams prepared from polyether containing polyols using gel catalyst compositions containing an organotin compound, a phosphorus compound and a halogen compound. Surprisingly it has now been found that if the phosphorus and halogen are both present in a compound containing a tin atom that is in turn, bonded to at least one hydrocarbyl group the resultant foam exhibit improved stability at elevated temperatures relative to a foam prepared using an organotin compound as the gel catalyst in the absence of phosphorus and halogen compounds. In addition, the foam exhibits excellent resiliency following prolonged compression.The phosphorus and halogen can be present in the same organotin compound or in two different organotin compounds. This invention provides a method for preparing a flexible cellular polyurethane exhibiting improved resiliency and resistance to heat induced degradation by reacting a polyether containing polyol containing at least two active hydrogen atoms per molecule, as determined by the Zerewitinoff method, with a polyfunctional isocyanate, the reaction being conducted in the presence of a blowing agent and a catalytically effective amount of a gel catalyst composition consisting essentially of at least one organotin compound containing an active halogen and at least one organotin compound containing phosphorus in ehemically combinea orm herein the molar ratio of tin to phosphorus is from 0.045 to 23, the molar ratio of tin to active halogen is from 0.5 to 23, the molar ratio of phosphorus to active halogen is from 0.5 to 22, and wherein the phosphorus containing organotin compound is an organotin ester of a phosphorus compound selected from the group consisting of ortho phosphoric, meta phosphoric, pyrophosphoric, thiophosphoric, phosphorous, phosphinic, phosphinous, phosphonous and phosphonic acids, phosphoryl chloride and oligomeric condensation product of 1 phosphonic acid, 2 mixtures containing phosphoric and phosphonic acids or 3 esters of phosphoric and phosphonic acids and alcohols containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. The present gel catalysts are useful for preparing both flexible and rigid polyurethane foams rom substantially all of the known polyether containing polyols, polyfunctional isocyanates and blowing agents. The concentration of the catalyst is usually from 0.005 to 1 , based on the weight of polyol. The present catalysts are organotin esters of monomeric or condensed phosphoric acid, thiophosphoric, phosphorous, phosphonous, phosphinic, phosphinous or phosphonic, acid or phosphoryl chloride. Phosphoryl chloride is, in turn, a derivative of phosphoric acid. The organotin moiety R2Sn or RSn may be the only esterifying group present on the phosphorus containing acid. Alternatively, the catalyst may be a mixed ester obtained by reacting an organotin halide or an organotin oxide or hydroxide with the desired phosphorus containing ester derived from an alcohol or phenol. As used herein the term active halogen refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine that is bonded directly to a tin or phosphorus atom. All of the present catalyst compositions contain an organotin compound bearing at least one active halogen atom. The active halogen and the phosphorus atom can be present in the same organotin compound, such as dibutylchlorotin diethyl phosphite. Alternatively the catalyst composition may be a mixture of two organotin compounds, one containing phosphorus and the other containing an active halogen atom. Organotin compounds containing both phosphorus and a halogen atom that are useful as gel catalysts in accordance with the present method exhibit the general formulaEMI7.1 In the foregoing formulae a is 1 or 2, b is 0, 1 or 2, X represents an active halogen, OH, 00CR2, OR2 or SR3 wherein R2 is hydrocarbyl and R3 is hydrocarbyl, R4COOR2, 2 or R OOCR wherein R is alkylene and contains from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, with the proviso that said organotin compound contains at least one active halogen d is 0, 1 or 2 with the proviso that d can be 0 only when the group represented by Y con tains phosphorus f isEMI7.2 whereinV is OZ or X and p is 0 or an integer from 1 to 10 Z isEMI7.3 wherein M is R6, OR , OR6 1OZ or Y, wherein R5 is hydrocarbyl, haloalkyl, halogen or Y, R6 is hydrocarbyl, R7 is hydrocarbyl or hydrogen.R6 is CH2CH2 or CH CH3 CH2 , c is 0 or 1, f is an integer from 1 to 100 m is 0 or an integer from 1 to 10 U is oxygen or sulfur, e si 1 or 2, RÚ is hydrocarbyl or R3COOR6 wherein R9 is hydrocarbyl and Q isEMI8.1 wherein g is O or an integer from 1 to 6. If b in the foregoing formula is. O and Y does not contain an active halogen atom, an organotin compound containing at least one tin to halogen bond must be included in the catalyst composition. The term hydrocarbyl includes alkyl, cycloalkyl, zryl, aralkyl and alkaryl groups. Any alkyl group contains from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and the preferred aryl group is phenyl. Several organotin esters of phosphorus containing acids and organic esters thereof are reported in the chemical literature. Compounds containing a single tin atom are prepared by reacting an organotin oxide or hydroxide with an organic ester of the desired phosphorus containing acid under conditions conventionally employed for transesterification reactions and in the presence of a liquid hydrocarbon that forms an azeotropic mixture with the alcohol formed as a by product of the transesterification reaction.Alternatively, the unesterifiedacid can be used or the desired organotin halide can be reacted with the sodium salt Ïf the phosphorus containing acid or a partial ester thereof. If the final compound contains a fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atom bonded to tin, the corresponding organohydroxyhalostannane or bis dlhydrocarbylhalo distannoxane can be employed as the organotin reactant. An example of the former class of compounds is butylchlorodihydroxystannane C4H9SnCl OH 2. This class of compounds is disclosed inUnited States Patent 3,758,536, the pertinent sections of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Compounds containing one or more groups represented by Y In the aforementioned structural formula can be prepared using a reaction product of an organ9tin halide with a diorganotin oxide or organostannoic anhydride when U is oxygen. When U represents sulfur, a diorganotin sulfide or organothiostannoic anhydride is employed. The molar ratio of organotin halide to the oxygen pr sulfur containing compound is selected to achieve the desired value of p in the foregoing formula. Organotin compounds containing a plurality of tin atoms joined by sulfur or oxygen are well known in the chemical literature, and a detailed discussion concerning the preparation of these types of compounds in the present specification would be repetitious. The following reactions are typical, wherein Bu represents n C4Hg . EMI10.1 Bt 2SnCl2 xBu2SnO . yClBu2Sn OSnBu2 xClClBu2Sn OSnBua xCl NyOP OC4H2 2 ClBuSn OSnBU2 xOP OC4H9 Compounds of the general formula ClBu2Sn OSnBu2 xCl can exist in linear form as shown. Alternatively these compounds can form cyclic structures wherein the ring contains a plurality ofEMI10.2 bonds and from 5 to 10 or more atoms. Cyclic compounds of this type are discussed in chapter 12 of a text entitled The Chemistry of Organotin Compounds by R. C. Poller Academic Press, New York, 1970 . The organotin halide canbbe reacted with the phosphorus containing acid or a partial or complete ester thereof prior to or following reaction of the organotin halide with the organotin compound containing oxygen or sulfur.An example of the former is represented by the reactionEMI11.1 Additional tin atoms can be introduced into the molecule by increasing the molar ratio of the diorganotin sulfide.Alternatively, the corresponding diorganotin oxide can be used in place of the sulfide. The foregoing reaction also demonstrates that the present compounds may contain both monoorganotin and diorganotin groups. During preparation of the present compounds an alkali metal salt of the desired phosphorus containing acid can be reacted with a bis organohalotin oxide using an alcohol as the reaction medium. This reaction proceeds relatively rapidly at a temperature from ambient to about 500C. The advantage of using alcohol is that the reaction product is usually soluble and the sodium halide formed as a by product precipitates from the reaction mixture. Alternatively, the free phosphorus containing acid can be reacted with an organotin oxide or an organostannoic anhydride in a liquid hydrocarbon such as toluene that forms an azeotropic mixture with the water formed as a by product of the reaction.In this instance the reaction is conducted at the boiling point to remove the by product water as it is formed, thereby providing a driving force for the reaction. In addition to alcohols and liquid hydrocarbons, liquid carboxylic acids can be used as the reaction medium for preparing the organotin compounds employed as gel catalysts in accordance with this invention. It has been found that if the resultant diluted reaction product is employed as a gel catalyst for a flexible polyurethane foam, the thermal stability and resiliency of the foam is superior relative to foams prepared in the absence of the acid. The accompanying examples disclose procedures for preparing the various classes of catalysts that are useful in accordance with the present method. Exemples of specific compounds that are within the scope of this invention are, represented by the formulae EMI12.1 EMI13.1 EMI13.2 EMI14.1 tb SEP 0 tb SEP II tb SEP C1 SEP SEP OP OH 2 tb SEP ii SEP i tb R2SnOSnR2 tb SEP C1 SEP R1 SEP O SEP C1 tb SEP ii SEP 1 SEP II SEP I tb R2SnOSnOPOSnR2 tb SEP I SEP 1 tb SEP R SEP OH tb SEP C1 tb R2l n12HPO SEP and tb SEP SCH2COOR1 SEP 1 SEP 0 SEP C1 tb SEP ii SEP 1 SEP II SEP 1 tb R2Sn S SnCR SEP 20POSnR2 tb SEP OH tb wherein R11 is hydrocarbyl. The last of the aforementioned compounds can be prepared by replacing a chlorine atom with a mercaptoester group using equimolar amounts of ester and organotin compound. When the hydrocarbon group bonded to tin in the foregoing formulae is specified it is often shown as butyl.It should be obvious, however, that compounds containing other hydrocarbon groups, e.g. methyl, octyl, phenyl and cyclohexyl, would be equally suitable for use in the present catalyst compositions. Flexible polyurethane foams of improved oxidative stability are prepared by reacting a polyfunctional isocyanate with a polyol containing ether C O C or a combination of ether and esterEMI14.2 groups and two or more reactive hydrogen atoms as determined by the Zerewitinoff method. In accordance with the present method, this reaction is catalyzed by one of the organotin compounds of this invention. This reaction is usually exothermic and occurs concurrently with gas evolution, resulting in formation of a cellular structure. The gas evolving or blowing agent can be water, which reacts with excess polyfunctional isocyanate to yield carbon dioxide. Water can be used in combination with a volatile liquid fluorocarbon such as trichlorofluoromethane Qr dichloromethane. liven water is present as a blowing agent the reaction mixture may also contain a catalyst for the blowing or foaming reaction to coordinate the foaming and polymerization reactions, thereby retaining structural integrity and achieving the desired uniformly small cell size within the foam. Tertiary amines such as bis N, dimethylaminoethyl ether and triethylene diamine are preferred blowing catalysts.One to five tenths of one part by weight of blowing catalyst is usually employed for every one hundred parts of polyol.Silicon compounds, particularly reaction products of silanes wit 1,2 olefin oxides, are often included as cell modifying agents, commonly referred to as surfactants. If one or more amines are employed as blowing catalysts, these will also catalyze the reactions between the polyfunctional isocyanate and polyol. The use of amlnes as gel catalysts is well known in the prior art, however, amines are often less than satisfactory due to their low catalytic activity. In the past it was necessary to employ a prepolymer in order to attain the desired molecular weight while avoiding unduly long rise times. The polyfunctional isocyanates used to prepare poly methanes using the present gel catalysts include both polyisocyanates and polyisothiocyanates. While the invention is described with specific references to the reaction of certain disocyanates, it is generically applicable to the reaction of any compound containing two or more N C G radicals wherein G is oxygen or sulfur. Compounds within this generic definition include polyisocyanates and polyisothiocyanates of the formulaR NCG x in which x is 2 or more.R can be alkylene, substituted arylene or other divalent hydrocarbon radical that may optionally contain one or more aryl NCG bonds and one or more alkyl NCG bonds Although a variety of organic polyisocyanates containing 3 or more isocyanate radicals per molecule can be used in the practice of this invention, diisocyanates are usually preferred in flexible foam formulations. Suitable isocyanates include alkylene diisocyanates such as hexamethylene diisocyanate, and decamethylene diisocyanate, the isomeric toluene diisocyanates and naphthalene diisocyanates, 4,141 diphenylmethane diisocyanate and mixtures of two or more of the foregoing diisocyanates.Triisocyanates obtained by reacting voles of an arylene diisocyanate for each mole of a triol, e.g., products formed from 3 moles of tolylene diisocyanate and 1 mole of hexane triol may also be present in the reaction mixture. A preferrred polyisocyanate is a mixture containing 80S by weight of the 2,14 isomer and 20 percent of the 2,6 isomer of toluene dilsocyanate. Other suitable polyfunctional isocyanatea include hexamethylene diisocyanate, xylylene diisocyanate, l methyl 2,14 diisocyanates, diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate, naphthalene 1,5 diisocyanate, triphenylmethane 4,4 ,4 triisocyanate and xylene a,a diisothiocyanate.Oligomeric and polymeric isocyanates of the general formulae R NCG x and UR NCG X y in which x and y are between 2 and 10, are also useful in the present method as are compounds of the general formula M NCG x wherein x is 2 or more and t14 is a difunctional or polyfunctional atom mr gr6up. An example of this type is polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate. Suitable polyether type polyols include polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycols and polypropylene glycols. he molecular weight of these compounds is preferably between bout 200 and 5000. As previously disclosed, polyols containing both ether and ester groups within the molecule are suitable for preparing polyurethane foams using the catalysts of this invention. The preparation of polyurethane foams can be accom lishes by forming a prepolymer, i.e. prereacting molar equivalents of a hydroxyl terminated polyol and isocyanate in he absence of water and thereafter producing a foam by the addition of excess isocyanate, water and optionally other blowing agents and one of the present gel catalysts. Alteractively, foams may be produced by the one shot method in which all of the reactants and catalysts are mixed together and allowec to react in the presence of water or other blowing agent. The polyfunctional isocyanate is typically present in an amount of 5 to 300 percent, preferably from 30 to 50 percent by weight of the polyol. Water may optionally be present as a blowing agent to react with excess isocyanate and generate sufficient carbon dioxide to produce a foam of the desired density. The amount of water is between 1 and 10 percent, preferably between 2 and 5 percent, based upon the weight of the polyol. The amount of isocyanate used can be in excess of the stoichiometric amount required to react with the active hydrogen atoms present in the polyol and any water present, thereby formi ng allophanateEMI19.1 and biuretEMI19.2 linkages in the polymer chains. Depending upon the desired density of the urethane foam and the amount of crosslinking desired, the ratio of equivalent weights of isocyanate groups to moles of active hydrogen atom present in the polyol and any water present should be from 0.8 to 1.2, respectively, preferably between 0.9 and 1.1. The gel catalyst and one or more blowing catalysts are present in an amount corresponding to from 0.01 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts of polyol. Preferably the gel catalyst is present in an amount corresponding to between 0.005 and 5.0 part by weight per 100 parts of polyol. The formulation employed to prepare polyurethane foams using the gel catalysts of this invention may contain various additives conventionally incorporated into flexible polyurethane foams. These additives include fillers such as bytes and calcium carbonate, flame retarding agents such as antimony oxide and phosphorous compounds such as triphenylphosphine oxide. The following examples demonstrate the oxidative stability and excellent recovery properties that distinguish flexible foams prepared using the present gel catalysts from those obtained using organotin compounds alone or in combination with a halogen compound and a phosphorus compound.All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified.EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of Dibutylchlorotin Diethyl PhosphiteEMI20.1 Sodium diethyl phosphite was prepared by stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere 9.2g 0.4 AU sodium and 55.2g 0.4 mole diethyl hydrogen phosphite in 150cc of tetrahydrofuran while maintaining the temperature of the reaction mixture below 1410 C.

XAMPThE 10 Preparation of Flexible Polyurethane Foams The compounds described in the preceeding nine examples were employed as gel catalysts for flexible polyurethane foams using the following formulation Ingredient . Parts by weight Polyoll 100 Water 3.5 Poly oxyethylene oxypropylene siloxane Blowing catalyst2 0.45 Gel catalyst as specified Toluene diisocyanate3 45.5 1 An ethylene oxide propylene oxide copolymer available as Niax 16 56 from the Union Carbide Corporation. 2 A mixture containing 0.15 part of a commercially availble tertiary amine blowing catalyst Polycat 77, distributed by Abbott Laboratories and 0.30 part of triethylene diamine as a 33 solution in dipropylene glycol . 3 Isocyanate index 105 The reagents were blended for five seconds using a speed mixer and then poured into a one liter capacity polyethylene lined paper cup and allowed to rise. Each of the resultant cylindrical foam samples was cut in half lengthwise and one of the halves was tested for oxidative and thermal stability in accordance with the procedure set forth in the American Society for Testing and Materials AST.M Test Method D 1564 71 suffix A . The sample to be tested was placed in a circulating air oven at a temperature of 1400C for 22 hours, then withdrawn from the oven and allowed to cool for between 10 and 15 minutes.A portion of the flat surface of e2ch sample was depressed to the maximum extent and the pressure released almost immediately. Samples that were sufficiently resilient to recover their original shape without any vIsible damage were considered to have passed the test and all others were considered failures. The procedure employed to determine the 90 compression set value is described in the aforementionedASTM test method, and consists of compressing a foam sample to 10 of its original height for 22 hours at a temperature of 700C. The height of the foam sample is measured prior to compression and thirty minutes following release of compression. The 90 compression set value is calculated using the formula 90 compression set to t to ts x 1.00. In the foregoing formula to is the height of the foam sample prior to compression, tf Is the height of the sample measured 30 minutes following the release of compression and t5 is the height of the spacer bar employed in the test procedure described in the aforementioned ASTM method. Polyurethane foams employed in seat cushions and mattresses should exhibit 90 compression set values of less than bout 15 All of the present catalysts evaluated produced foams that were within this range. By comparison, foams prepared using several prior art catalyst compositions wherein the tin, phosphorus and halogen are distributed among two or three compounds exhibited 90 compression set values considerably above 15 and as high as 90,.
