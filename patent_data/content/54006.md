The invention relates to an improved cutter bar. The bar consists basically of a stationary comb 1 upon whose teeth a toothed blade 2 slides back and forth in alternating motion while being maintained in contact with the comb by means of blade retaining brackets 3 the blade and the comb are furnished with respective recesses 2b 1b , the latter being longitudinally disposed. The recesses are opposed in such a way as to establish an enclosed channel into which a rod 5 may be inserted with the capability of sliding therein.
