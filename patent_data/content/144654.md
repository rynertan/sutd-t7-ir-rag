# SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE STRUCTURE INCLUDING A DIELECTRICALLY ISOLATED INSULATED GATE TRANSISTOR

## Abstract
An insulated gate transistor is dielectrically isolated from other semiconductor devices in a monolithic semicon ductor device structure. The insulated gate transistor, in one form, includes, in successively adjoining relationship, a source region, a base region, a voltage supporting region and a minority carrier injection region. The interfaces between selected, adjacent pairs of these device regions are oriented in their entireties orthogonal to a major surface of the semiconductor device structure that is planar. As a consequence, the insulated gate transistor achieves a high current capacity as well as high voltage operation without the need for electric field rings. The insulated gate transistor, in another form, constitutes a bidirectional device with the interfaces, between adjacent device regions being oriented as in the foregoing insulated gate transistor so as to also achieve the same advantages.
