## Description
The present invention relates to an ink composition for dry planographic printing having superior anti toning and fluidity properties.For the planographic printing which is currently in use in the printing industry, a printing plate having a hydrophilic non image area and an oleophilic image area is employed, whereby the fact that water and oil based printing inks repel each other is exploited in such a way that after water has been applied to the hydrophilic non image area, the oil based ink is applied only to the oleographic image area and then transferred onto the material that is to be printed.However, in this conventional planographic printing process it is difficult to control the behavior of the fountain solution which prevents the adhesion of the ink to the non image area, so that the employment of a fountain solution is a considerable obstacle as far as printability and printing performance are concerned. Accordingly, various suggestions for dry planographic printing processes not requiring a fountain solution have been made. The most recent and practicable of these suggestions involves the use of a planographic printing plate having a thin ink repelent layer of silicone rubber or something similar on the non image area. It has been reported that in this case the conventional oil based printing ink can be used effectively without applying a fountain solution to the surface of the printing plate.However, it has been found tn actual practice that the use of conventional oil based printing ink involves undesirable toning in the non image area. This is attributable to the fact that the cohesive energy of the ink is reduced due to the temperature increase on the surface of the printing plate as a result of the friction of the driving parts or rollers of the printing press during printing, so that the ink adheres to the non image area which should normally be ink repellent. To overcome these problems a method of increasing the cohesive energy by employing a resin of high molecular weight may, for example, be considered, but this method involves such difficulties as piling on the blanket, picking, etc.Another possible method involves a process in which aluminum compounds such as aluminumstearate, aluminum octoate, etc., are added to the varnish for gelation. But if a high anti toning property is to be obtained by this method, the viscosity of the ink is increased considerably and the flow and distribution of the ink on the printing press or the transfer onto the printing plate or the blanket is extremely impaired. Thus this method, too, is far from satisfactory at present.After investigating ink compositions suitable for dry planographic printing, the present inventors have discovered that an ink composition gelated with organotitanate yields favorable results, and they arrived at the invention described in detail hereinbelow.The present invention relates more specifically to an improved ink composition for.use in dry planographic printing, characterized in that at least one of the organotitanates represented by the following general formulae 1 and 2 is employed as a gelating agent. 1 R1 0 m Ti O XtR2 Y p whereby R1 is an alkyl group, aryl group, aralkyl 6 group, alkenyl group or alkanoyl group, X isEMI2.1 R2 is an alkylene group or arvlene group, Y is NH2, SH, OH, CH CH2,EMI3.1 or H, m and n are integers of 0 to 4, with m n 4, and p is 1 or 2 2 R O 4 Ti P OR4 2OH 2 whereby R is an alkyl group, aryl group, aralkyl group, alkenyl group or alkanoyl group, and R4 is an alkyl group or aryl group.The organotitanate compounds represented by these two formulae may be tetraisopropyl bis dioctylphosphito titanate, di dioctylpyrophosphÅato ethylene titanate, isopra triisostearcyl titanate, gsoprspyl tridodecylbenzensulfonyl titanate, tetrabueyl titanate, etc.The above organotitanates used as a gelating agent for the present invention are effective not only singly but also when two or more are mixed, and they may also be used effectively simultaneously with aluminum compounds such as convey tionally employed. Although the content of organotitanate in the ink depends on what components the ink is constituted of, it should be in the range of 0.1 to 10 by weight, and preferably 0.5. to 5 by weight relative to the weight Of. the varnish. The varnish as formulated above exhibits relatively low viscosity, and the ink produced from such varnish is markedly superior in fluidity and its anti toning property, so that it displays sufficient performance in printing.The component constituting the varnish may be a known material such as a drying oil, rosin, rosin ester, phenolic resin, rosin modified phenolic resin, alkyd resin, epoxy resin, aminoalkyd resin, etc. or a urethane modified vegetable oil, urethane modified alkyd resin, etc., but particularly a com position mainly consisting of a rosin modified phenolic resin, rosin modified phenolic resin and urethane modified vegetable oil, and rosin modified phenolic resin and urethane modified alkyd resin. The coloring material may be any one used in conventional ink compositions, such as organic or inorganic pigments, etc.Other known materials such as wax, grease, dryers, dispersing agents, fillers and the like may also be added.The gelation reaction using organotitanate may be carried out in the range between room temperature and 2500C, and attained by the addition of the predetermined amount of organotitanate to the varnish while stirring. The reaction time of 10 to 30 minutes may be sufficient for the purpose.The varnish thus obtained has relatively low viscosity so that it yields a soft ink having superior fluidity and transfer properties, and also a high critical toning temperature. The resultant printed matter thus has superior gloss and is of extremely high quality.Hereinbelow examples are given to illustrate the present invention, without however limiting the scope thereof. Note that the parts employed in the examples are based on parts by weight.EXAMPLE 1 and CONTROL 1Ink A was prepared from the varnish gelated with tetraiso propyl bis dioctylphosphito titanate, and ink B was prepared from the varnish gelated with aluminum octoate. When the critical toning temperatures, an index for anti toning, were measured, both ink A and ink B exhibited 400C. The results of fluidity measurement for these inks, taken by a spread meter, are shown as follows Flow Value mm IC mm Intercept Ink A 362 21.3 Ink B 33.1 20.7Ink A prepared from the varnish gelated with tetraisopropyl bis dioctylphosphito titanate had better fluidity.and feel when handled by an ink pellet.Printing was carried out with these inks by the Komori sSprint, offset press, using a dry planographic printing plate having an ink repellent layer composed of silicone rubber in the non image area, without the use of a fountain solution applied to the plate surface.As a result it was found that ink A was superior in its quick response to the change of ink feeding from an ink duct, and yielded printed matter of higher quality and better gloss.Ink A ink prepared from the varnish gelated with organo titanate Benzidine yellow G 15.0 parts Rosin modified phenolic resin 16.5 parts varnish I Rosin modified phenolic resin gel 65.0 parts varnish II Cobalt naphthenate 0.5 part Metal concentration 6.0 Solvent No. 5 Nippon Oil Co. 3.0 parts Total 100 partsWhen the mixture of the above was milled on a triple roll mill, an ink for dry planographic printing having the ink o meter tack value of 12.6 value after 1 min at 400 rpm and 300C was obtained.

A dry planographic printing plate having an ink repellent layer of silicone rubes was mounted on a printing press modified so as to be capable of raising the temperature on the plate surface by circulating hot water through the plate cylinder, and printing was carried out while raising the temperature of the plate surface without the application of a fountain solution. Thus the temperature of the plate surface was recorded as the critical toning temperature when toning became noticeable on the printed matter at the standard solid density. When ink having a higher critical toning temperature was used, toning did not take place readily in the actual printing process.EXAMPLE 2 and CONTROL 2Ink C was prepared from the varnish gelated with di dioctylpyrophosphato ethylene titanate, and ink D was prepared from the varnish gelated with aluminum distearate. It was found, as shown in the table below, that although the critical toning temperatures and ink o meter tack values were approximately the same, ink C was greatly superior in regard to fluidity.
