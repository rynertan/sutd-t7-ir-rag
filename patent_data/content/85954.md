# Incorporation of pyridoxal phosphate in dry analytical elements for the determination of enzymes.

## Abstract
Enzymes which are activated by pyridoxal phosphate are assayed in a dry analytical element which includes a high coverage of pyridoxal phosphate. The coverage of pyridoxal phosphate is such that the multiplication product of the coverage and the spreading coefficient of the element results in a reagent mixture concentration of at least about 0.9 mmole per liter when a liquid sample is contacted with the element. This coverage eliminates the need for preincuba tion of the sample with a solution containing pyridoxal phosphate. The reactions for the determination of the enzymes are initiated by contact of the dry elements with a liquid sample.
