## Description
The present invention relates to tablets which rapidly disperse in solution and are useful for the treatment of gastric hyperacidity. The present invention also provides methods for preparing such tablets. Formulations used to combat gastric hyperacidity conventionally contain an insoluble base or an alkaline salt with a weak acid of magnesium or aluminium or a mixture of such bases or salts. Occasionally insoluble bases or alkaline salts with weak acids of sodium, calcium ad bismuth are also included in the formulations togethei with the said Magnesium and or aluminium bases or salts. Thus typical formulations often contain aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide or m.agrLesium carbonate. These antacid formulations act by neutralising excess acidity in the stomach. To glve rapid reiief f gastric hyperacidity it is ,recessary that antacid formulations give rapid release of the active ingredients on administration. Unfortunately, the formulations at present marketed are often deficient in this respect.Antacid formulations currently available are normally in tablet or suspension form and of these the suspension form gives the most rapid release of active ingredients. A new form of antacid tablet has now been developed which not only gives a far more rapid release of ingredient than those antacid tablets which have gone before but also gives a more rapid release of ingredients than some antacid suspensions presently available. Such tablets contain a disintegrating agent that has a capacity to swell substantially in the presence of water. Accordingly, the present invention provides a dispersible tablet for the treatment of gastric hyperacidity, which comprises 50 905 of a conventional antacid component and 5 1 of a disintegrating gent having a swelling capacity of between S and 100 m g. All percentages herein are expressed as weight weight unless otherwise stated. Antacid components suitable for inclusion in the tablets of the present invention are, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable metal bases or alkaline salts with weak acids conventionally used in antacid formulations see, for example,Martindale, the Extra Pharmacopoeia, 27th Ed., for a list of conventional antacid formulations and their ingredients , which have a solubility in water of less than 1 part in 70 under neutral conditions. It is usual to include a mixture of insoluble metal compounds in the tablets of the present invention but the invention also includes the case where only one such compound is included.The tablets contain 50 to 90 , preferably 60 to 70 of the antacid component s . Suitable insoluble metal compounds include those of calcium, such as calcium carbonate, of bismuth, such as bismuth carbonate and bismuth subnitrate, of aluminium, such as aluminium hydroxide, aluminium oxide, aluminium phosphate and a m.nium glycinate, and of magnesium, such as magnesiui, hydroxide, magnesium carbonate and magnesium silicate. Mixed bases and or alkaline sails, tjat is tc say bases and or salts formed from more than one metal such as sodium polyhydroxy aluminium monocarbonate, sodium magnesium aluminium silicate, magnesium aluminium hydroxide.and magnesium aluminate, are also suitable. Particularly suitable insoluble metal compounds are those of aluminium and magnesium. Thus, aluminium hydroxide is a preferred compound for inclusion in the tablets of the present invention.Preferred magnesium compounds include magnesium carbonate and, in particular, magnesium hydroxide.It has been found that z combination of aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide provides a particularly favourable antacid component for the tablets of the present invention. Suitably the aluminium hydroxide and the magnesium hydroxide are in weight ratio of from 4 1 to 1 4 and preferably in a weight ratio of from 4 1 to 1 2. Tablots containing these ingredie..ts may suitably contain from 200 to 1000mg of these components per tablet, for example 400 to 500 rig per tablet. A suitable dose for the treatment of gastric hyperaciditY in man is 1 to 4 tablet repeated ac required. As used herein the swelling capacity of a disintegrating agent is defined as the volume ml to which 1 g. of a test tablet containing 95 of the dry, disintegrating agent and 5 of polyvinylpyrollidone K30 will swell when in contact with an excess of water at a temperature of 210C. It is determined by granulating the disintegrating agent 2 g with 109 polyvinylpyrollidone K30 1 ml and drying the resultant granules at 600C. Compression of the granules to a hardness value of 12 kg. provides test tablets having a diameter of 15 mm and a weight of approximately 900 mg. Each tablet is then accurately weighed and placed on the bottom of a 25 ml. measuring cylinder. A nylon disc of 8 mm thickness and having two grooves provides a close, but sliding, fit in the measuring cylinder, resting on the top of the tablet.The grooves are disposed opposite each other on the circumference of the disc in a direction at right angles to the plane thereof and allow for a thin hypodermic needle to be inserted between the disc and the glass wall ef the measuring cyli der. A 5 g. weight is placed on the nylon disc and water injected through ojue of the grooves into the space surrounding te tablet the other groove allowing for air to be displaced. When the water level is above the top of the disc, the needle can be removed and water added until it is in excess, e.g. 25 ml. The volume under the disc is then noted at periodic intervals until there is no further increase in absorption.In some cases, disintegrating agents absorb water to form viscous gels, and this slows down the rate of absorption necessitating a longer interval, such as 48 hours, before maximum swelling is achieved. On completion of swelling, the final volume is read and corrected to the corresponding value for 1 g. of the tablet, i.e. the value for the swelling capacity. The whole operation should preferably be performed at an approximately constant room temperature, for example 210C. Disir,tegrating agents which have a swelling capacity greater than 5 ml g. and less than 100 mi g. and which therefore may be used in the pesnt invention include calcium carboxy methyl cellulos s, such as E.C.C3. 505, low viscosity sodium carboxy methyl celluloses. such as Copagel andNymcel, gdar bass4 veOeble gums, such as Supercol U and Supercol NG l, a sod alginate, such as alginate YZ, cross linked sodium carboxymethylcelluloses, such as CLD, cross linked polyvinylpyrollidones, such as Plasdone XL, low substituted hydroxypropylcelluloses, such as L HPC, cation exchange resins, such as amberlite IRP 88, and sodium starch glycolates, such as Primojel orExplotab Trade Marks . The most preferred disintegrating agents are Primojel and Explotab.The disintegrating agents will normally have a swelling capacity of less than 60 ml g. The percentage of disintegrating agent which is incorporated in the tablets of the invention will depend to a large extent on the swelling capacity of the disintegrating agent.Thus, if the disintegrating agent is one which has a high swelling capacity, such as Primojel or Explotab, the amount of disintegrating agert present will normally be between 5 and 10 .However, if a disintegrating agent of low swelling capacity is used then t Till normally be present in a great amot, i.e. between and 156. The particle size, as hor naster defined, of the antacid component will rormally be. below 100 pm and preferably below 50 pm. As used herein, the particle size of the antacid component is defined in terms of the weight median diameter hereinafter referred to as W.M.D. Thus, each particle is considered as a sphere having a volume identical with the actual particle and the W.M.D. is that diameter , wherein 50t of these hypothetical spheres have a larger diameter than that figure and 50 a smaller diameter than that figure.The W.M.D. may be determined using aCoulter counter in which the antacid component dispersed in an electrolyte comprising an aqueous solution of, for example, sodium chloride, saturated with the antacid component is passed through a small orifice in a tube on either side of which is immersed an electrode. The changes in resistance as particles pass through the orifice generate voltage pulses whose amplitudes are proportional to the volume of the particles.The pulses are amplified, and the numbers counted at different threshold levels. From this data the distribution of the suspended particles and hence the W.M.D. may be determined. The particle size of the antacid component may readily be reduced, if desired, by precipitation techniques or by grinding the particles with any apparatus or by any other method known in the art suitable for such purposes In particular, the hammer mill, which can be used with either the rigid or the swing hammer type and is conveniently combined with a fan and a cyclone for collecting the material, is preferred. In order to reduce flatulence anti foam agents, such as siloxanes for example polymethylsiloxane and polydimethylsiloxane, are often included in conventional antacid formulations.Thus, in one preferred embodiment the tablets of the present invention will also contain an anti fcaming agent. Suitably the tablet will contain between 1 and 5 of an anti foaming agent. It has been found that certain antacid materials and particulavly aluminium hydroxide inhibit the anti foaming properties of lyd polydimethylsiloxane see J. narm. Sci. 55, 538, 1966 and when such an antacid material is incorporated into the the rablets of the invention it has been found to be convenient to separate it from the anti foaming agent.It has beeen found that compression coating the anti foaming agent with one of the other ingredients of the tablets, for example magnesium hydroxide in the case where both aluminium and magnesium hydroxides are used as the antacid component, to give a central core around which the aluminium hydroxide or other antacid material may be formulated gives a satisfactory separated product.Alternatively, a mixed granule system compressed as a conventional tablet gives satisfactory separation of the anti foam agent. Other component which may be incorporated in the tablets of thepmsent invention include granulating agents, lubricating agents and binder disintegrants and pharmaceutical excipients conventionally used in tablet formulations.Granulating agents will normally be included In the tablets and suitable granulating agents include stare in the forum of mucilage5 starch derivatives, such as starch Snow Flake , cellulose derivatives, such as methylcellulose, gelatin and polyvinyrollidone. Po yviìylpyrollidone is particularly preferred. Lubricating agents are added to prevent the tablets from adhering to the punches and dies of the automatic tabletting equipment. Magnesium Stearate, Magnesium LaurylSulphate, and Sodium Lauryl Sulphate are convenient lubricating agents for inclusion in the tablets.Binder disintegrants, as the name implies, serve a dual purpose in holding the tablets together until they come into contact with aqueous media when they aid the tablets disintegration. Avicel, a microcrystalline cellulose, and L HPC are particularly suitable examples of such binder disintegrants. Conventional pharmaceutical excipients such as dyes, flavourings, surfactants, preservatives and the like may be included. It has been found that the inclusion of mannitol and or lactose in the tablets of the present invention results in particularly advantageous products. In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of preparing a tablet as hereinbefore defined, which comprises the compression on stands machinery of a formulation con taining 50 9O90 of a con1entio a1 antacid component, as hereinbefore defined aid 5 15 of a disinteg cing agent having a swelling capacity of between 5 and 100 ml g. In order to aid the compression of the formulation into a tablet the formulation will normally be granulated before it is compressed.This granulation step comprises for example, mixing the antacid component with the disintegrating agent in a dry state at slow speed, for example around 15 rev min in a planetary mixer, followed by wet mixing for up to about 30 minutes with a granulating solution, together with additional solvent, if necessary, for maintaining the consistency of the mass. The material can then be milled and either tray dried or dried in a fluidised bed. The dry granulated material is then sifted and a lubricant added.The granules are then compressed on standard machinery to the specified hardness in the conventional manner. Whilst water may be cased as the solvent in the granulating solution this may lead to a reduction in the dispersion properties of the tablets We have fouud that the combination of water ti a watcr miscile organic solvent, such as alcohol, provides an acceptable solvent for the granulating solution. When the antacid component has good flow properties there may be no need to include a granulation step in which case the ingredients will be mixed together, a lubricant added and the resulting material compressed into tablets. The tablets of the present invention may either be administered in tablet form or sucked or alternatively may be placed in water to give a finely dispersed suspension. All forms of administration give a very rapid onset of neutralising power together with a high neutralisation capacity. The formulations of the present invention have a radically different therapeutic profile and fa superior properties from antacid preparations on the market. The following Exa tples which illustrate the invention, should in no way be construed as a limitation thereof.
