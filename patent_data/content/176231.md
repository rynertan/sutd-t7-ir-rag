# An ultra violet radiation actinometer.

## Abstract
The invention provides a novel actinometer comprising a solution of an organic disulphide in a solvent capable of donating hydrogen atoms. The actinometer is especially useful for measuring the integrated quantity of UV radiation falling thereon and has a wavelength response similar to that of the skin in relation to the ultra violet radiation which produces erythema.
