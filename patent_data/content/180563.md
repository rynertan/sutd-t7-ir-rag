# AN AMPHIPHATHIC GEL PRODUCT FOR CHROMATOGRAPHIC AND BATCHWISE ADSORPTION

## Abstract
An amphipathic gel according to the invention is charac terized in that a hydrophobic group is coupled to a hydro philic gel through a bridge which comprises thio ether sul phur. The gel may be a cross linked polysaccharide, a poly acrylic acid derivative or an inorganic substance, such as silica gel or glass or a derivative thereof, and the hydro phobic group may comprise, in addition to the thio ether sul phur, alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, alkaryl, aralkyl, hetero aryl, alkheteroalkyl, and unsubstituted or substituted with electrically neutral substituents. The gel is prepared by introducing an oxirane group or thiosulphate group into a hydrophilic gel and subsequently bringing the gel into contact with a hydrophobic mercaptan in an alkaline solution. The gel according to the invention can be used for the adsorption and desorption of amphipathic substances, and affords better separation than earlier similar products in which the hydrophobic ligand is bound to the hydrophilic gel over an oxygen bridge.
