# EXTRACTION

## Abstract
To extract a metal value, particularly aluminium, from an aqueous feed stream 10 containing the value to be extracted is treated in a recovery unit 11 from which it passes to a contactor 15 where it is contacted with a solvent stream 17 including a partially water soluble extractant for the value and an organic diluent. The delivery from the contactor is separated into an organic phase 26 , an aqueous raffinate 41 and a dispersed intermediate phase 37 . The organic phase is stripped of the value and recycled to the solvent stream. The raffinate as recycled by being added to the feed stream 10 , and the intermediate phase is treated for recovery of extractant.
