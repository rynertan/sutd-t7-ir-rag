# Apparatus for induction heating of molten metal.

## Abstract
The disclosed induction heating apparatus comprises a refractory vessel 2 in which a charge to be heated is placed said vessel comprising a refractory lining and an outer shell 3 covering the refractory lining and having strength high enough to sustain the lining an induction heating coil 4 arranged spacedly around the outer circumference of said shell and a bottom outer shell 6 covering the bottom of said refractory lining, said outer shell whose outer diameter is, at a position below the upper end of said coil, smaller than the inner diameter of said coil so as to enable the removal of said vessel through the upper side of said coil, at least part of said outer shell covering a height of the circumferential surface of said vessel corresponding to the height of said coil being made of a non magnetic material, and said bottom outer shell being made of metal.
