# Process for preparing nylon block copolymers and composition for use in the same.

## Abstract
A process for preparing a nylon 6 block copolymer in which a solution comprising an acyl lactam, epsilon caprolactam and magnesium chloride is brought into reac tive admixture with a solution of magnesium dilactam in epsilon caprolactam. The acyl lactam magnesium chloride solution is prepared by reaction of an acid halide functional material and magnesium dilactam.
