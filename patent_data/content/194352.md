## Description
SALICYLATE ASSAY, TRACERS, IMMUNOGENS AND ANTIODIES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Technical Field The present invention relates to a method and reagents for a fluorescence polarization ismunoassay procedure for determining the amount of salicylate in fluids, especially biological fluids such as serum, plasma or urine, and to a method of making the reagentsMore specifically, the invention relates to 1 reagents tracers and antibodies for determining he amount of salicylate in a sample 2 immunogen compounds used to raise antibodies 3 synthetic methods for making the tracer and immunogen compounds and 4 analytical methods for conducting the assay. 2. Background Art Salicylates are often prescribed as analgesics, antipyretics and anti inflammatory agents and are generally considered to be relatively safe drugs. However, in cases o extreme dosages, salicylates can cause toxic side effects ranging from nausea, vomiting and tinnitis to fever and coma.The availability of over the counter preparations can lead to accidental or intentional overdoses. Mereover, rheumatoid arthritis patients may need very high doses of salicylate because of severe pain associated with this type of chronic illness. Accordingly, in diagnosing cases of apparent overdose or in salicylate treatment of arthritic patients, it may be desirable to test or to monitor the levels of salicylate in urine, blood serum or plasma. In the past, patient serum or plasma salicylate levels have typically been measured by colorimetric, spectrophotometric and spectrofluorometric assays.These methods are not without drawbacks. They usually require chemical extraction of drug from the serum plasma matrix before analysis. Further, these methods are non specific in that they can detect salicylate like compounds as well as salicylates. High performance liquid chromatography HPLC and gas chromatography GC are used less frequently although they are very specific for detecting drug levels. HPLC and GC require extraction procedures and the assay time is lengthy. In assays for other substances, competitive binding immunoassays have provided a more satisfactory alternative. Typically, competitive binding immunoassays are used for measuring ligands in a test sample. For the purposes of this disclosure, a 1 ligand11 is a substance of biological interest to be quantitatively determined by a competitive binding immunoassay technique. The ligands tompete with a labeled reagent, or ligand analog, or tracer, n for a limited number of receptor binding sites on antibodies specific to the ligand and ligand analog. The concentration of ligand in the sample determines the amount of ligand analog which binds to the antibody the amount of ligand analog that will bind is inversely proportional to the concentration of ligand in the sample, because the ligand and the ligand analog each bind to the antibody in proportion to their respective concentrations. Fluorescence polarization provides a quanti tative means for measuring the amount of tracer antibody conjugate produced in a competitive binding immunoassay.Fluorescence polarization techniques are based on the principle that a fluorescent labeled compound, when excited by plane polarized light, will emit fluorescence having a degree of polarization inversely related to its rate of rotation. Accordingly, when a tracerantibody conjugate having a fluorescent label is excited with plane polarized light, the emitted light remains highly polarized because the fluorophore is constrained from rotating between the time that light is absorbed and emitted. In contrast, when an unbound tracer is excited by plane polarized light, its rotation is much faster than the corresponding tracer antibody conjugate and the molecules are more randomly oriented. As a result, the light emitted from the unbound tracer molecules is depolarized. Such fluorescence polarization techniques have been applied in U.S. Patent No. 4,420,568 to Wang, et al., which is directed to the use of a triazinylaminofluorescein moiety as the fluorophore. The present invention offers an advance in the art beyond the Wang, et al. patent, in that highly sensitive tracers, a method for making the tracers, and an assay using the tracers are provided specifically for the determination of salicylate. The assay conducted in accordance with the present invention is particularly accurate, as will be explained below.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a fluorescence polarization assay for salicylate to tracers, immunogens and antibodies for use in the assay and to methods for making the tracers, immunogens and antibodies.

The present invention involves the use of fluorescein and derivatives of fluorescein. In particular, a necessary property of fluorescein and its derivatives for the usefulness of the tracer compounds is the fluorescence of fluorescein. Fluorescein exists in two tautomeric forms, illustrated in Figure 4, depending on the acid concentration pom of the environment. In the open acid form, there are a number of conjugated double bonds which make that form of fluorescein and compounds containing a fluorescein moiety capable of absorbing blue light and emitting green fluorescence after an excited state lifetime of about 4 nanoseconds. When the open and closed forms coexist, the relative concentration of molecules in the open and closed forms is easily altered by adjustment of the pH level.Generally, the tracer compounds of the present invention exist in solution as biologically acceptable salts such as sodium, potassium, ammonium and the like, which allows the compounds to exist in the open, fluorescent form, when employed in the analytical methods of the present invention. The specific salt present will depend on the buffer employed to adjust the pH level.For example, in the presence of a sodium phosphate buffer, the compounds of the present invention will generally exist in the open form, as a sodium salt. As used herein, the term fluorescein, either as an individual compound or as a component of a larger compound, is meant to include both the open and closed forms1 if they exist for a particular molecule, except in the context of fluorescence. An open form is necessary for the fluorescence to occur. The numbering of carbon atoms of the fluorescein molecule varies, depending upon whether the open or closed form of the molecule is considered. Accordingly, the literature concerning fluorescein and its compounds is not uniform as to carbon atom numbering.In the closed form, the para carbon to the carbonyl of the lactone on the phenyl ring is numbered 6. In the open form, the para carbon to the carboxylic acid group on the phenyl ring is numbered 5. See Figure 4. For the purpose of this disclosure the numbering of the closed form is adopted because the raw materials used in the syntheses are most popularly numbered with that system. The carbon atom of fluorescein and its compounds which is opposite the carboxyl group is therefore numbered 6 for the purposes of the present disclosure. A tracer which is not complexed to an antibody is free to rotate in less than the time required for absorption and re emission of fluorescent light.As a result, the emitted light is relatively random ly oriented so that the fluorescence polarizaton of a tracer not complexed to an antibody is low, approaching zero. Upon complexing with a specific antibody, the tracer antibody complex thus formed assumes the rotation of the antibody molecule which is slower than that of the relatively small tracer molecule, thereby increasing the polarization observed. Therefore, when a ligand competes with the tracer for antibody sites, the observed polarization of fluorescence of the tracerantibody complex becomes a value somewhere between that of the tracer and tracer antibody complex If a sample contains a high concentration of the ligand, the observed polarization value is closer to that of the free tracer i.e., low. If the test sample contains a low concentration of the ligand, the polarization value is closer to that of the bound tracer i.e., high. By sequentially exciting the reaction mixture of an immunoassay with vertically and then horizontally polarized light and analyzing only the vertical component of the emitted light, the polarization of fluorescence in the reaction mixture may be accurately determined. The precise relationship between polarization and concentration of the ligand .to be determined is established by measuring the polarization values of calibrators with known concentrations. The concentration of the ligand can be extrapolated from a standard curve prepared in this manner. The particular tracers formed in accordance with this invention have been found to produce surprisingly good assays, as will be demonstrated later in this disclosure. 1. The Reagents Both the immunogens and the races of the present invention can be represented by the general structural formula set forth in the Summary of theInvention, and illustrated in Figure 5. When Q is a poly amino acid , the structure represents the immunogen when 9 is a fluorescein moiety, the structure represents the tracer. The objective is to have competition between salicylate and the tracer for the recognition sites of the antibody. Great variations in the structure of the haptens and tracers are allowed in achieving this goal. For the purposes of this invention, haptens are precursors of the immunogens, comprising generally a substituted benzoic acid derivative and a linking group to the poly amino acid carrier. a. The Structure of the Immunogens Usable antibodies can be produced from a variety of benzoic acid derivatives. Immunogens made from compounds that have OH, NH2, CH3, F or C1 in place of the OH on salicylic acid can produce antibodies in animals such antibodies are useful in a salicylate assay according to the invention when combined with the appropriate tracer. The immunogens of the present invention have the general structural formula shown in Figure 6, and in the preferred form of the invention, the immunogens have the structural formula shown in Figure 8. The immunogens can be prepared by coupling a compound of the class shown in Figure 2 with a poly amino acid or a derivative of a poly amino acid , as will be discussed in the context of the synthetic method and theExamples below. In a preferred form of the invention, the immunogen has the structural formula shown in Figure 8. This structure is preferred because the best recognition of the OH and COW groups occurs when the ring is substituted at a position as distant as possible from these groups. Although substitution at either the 4 or 5 positions is equivalently preferred from a structural point of view, starting materials are more readily available and the synthesis itself is greatly simplified for the 5 position on the ring. Although bovine serum albumin is the poly amino acid in this preferred form, it should be understood that various protein carriers may be employed, including albumins, serum proteins, e.g., globulins, ocular lens proteins, lipoproteins and the like. Illustrative protein carriers include bovine serum albumin, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, egg ovalbumin, bovine gamma globulin, thyroxine binding globulin, etc.Alternatively, synthetic poly amino acids may be prepared having a sufficient number of available amino groups such as lysines. b. The Structure of the Tracers The possible variations in the structure of the tracers of the invention are even greater than the possible variations in the structure of the haptens thereof. The tracers of the present invention have the general structural formula shown in Figure 7, where F1 represents a fluorescein moiety or a fluorescein derivative. In a preferred form of the invention, the tracers have the structural formula shown in Figure 9. The tracer is a benzoic acid derivative that is linked to a fluorescein derivative by, for example, an amido, amidino, triazinylamino, carbamido, thiocarbamido, carbamoyl, thiocarbamoyl, or sulfonylcarbamoyl group, as shown in Figure 11. The tracers are prepared by linking the appropriate fluorescein derivative to a benzoic acid derivative containing an amino, carboxylic acid, hydroxy, imidate, hydrazide, isocyanate, thioisocyanate, chloroformate, chlorothioformate, chloro sulfonylcarbamoyl, or the like group, as will be discussed in the context of the synthetic method and the Examples below. By way of example1 any of the following fluorescein derivatives can be used F1 NH2 fluorescein amine El C02H carboxyEluorescein Fl NECOCH2I v iodoacetamidofluorescein EMI12.1 DTAF 2,4 dichloro 1,3,5, triazin 2 yl amino fluoresceinEMI12.2 4 chloro 6 methoxy 1,3,5 triazin 2 ylamino fluorescein Fl NCS fluorescein thioisocyanate 2 The Antibodies The antibodies of the present invention are prepared by developing a response in animals to the immunogens described above. The immunogen is administered to animals such as rabbits or sheep by a series of injections, in a manner well known to those skilled in the art. 3 Synthetic Methods Both the immunogens and the tracers of the present invention can be made from a precursor having the general structural formula shown in Figure 10, where Y is OH, NH2, CH3, F, C1, Br or H when the preparation is directed to a tracer, and Y is OH, NH2, CM3 F or C1 when the preparation is directed to an immunogen W is OH or any salt of OH X is NH2, CCOH, CHO, CN, Br, I or OH when the preparation is directed to an immunogen, and NH2, COOH, CN or OH when the preparation is directed to a tracer and Zl Z2 and Z3 are each independently E or F when the preparation is directed to a tracer, and are each H when the preparation is direc ted to an i unogen. a. The Snthesis of the Immunogens The immunogens of the present invention are made by coupling a hapten, such as that shown by the general structure of Figure 2 when X is NH2, COOH, CN,CHO, bromine, iodine or OH, to a poly amino acid . The poly amino acid moiety can be linked to the hapten by an amide, an amidine, an alkyl, a urea, a thiourea, a carbamate, or a thiocarbamate linkage. In a preferred embodiment, the poly aminoacid is bovine serum albumin BSA , and the hapten is shown in Figure 17. The hapten is preferably coupled under conditions normally used to form an amide linkage, and such conditions are well known to those skilled in the art. It is most preferred that active ester procedures be used, as these are the most effective for forming the desired amide linkage in this context. The immunogens are prepared by coupling a hapten that contains an NH2, CO2H, CONTH2, CNQR, CHO, Br, I, NCO, NCS, OCOC1 or OCSC1 group to a poly amino acid . The NH2 case can be coupled by form ing a diazonium salt and adding this to the poly amino acid cr by activating the carboxylic acid group on the polyamino acid in the presence of the NH2 group. The diazonium salt method only works for aromatic amines and is typically prepared by mixing the gamine with sodium nitrite. In the case where Y NR2, protection followed by coupling and then deprotection of the Y NH2 would be necessary. The activation of the carboxylic acid groups on the poLy amino acid can be accomplished by mixing the hapten and the poly amino acid with l ethyl3 3 dimethylamino propyl carbodilmide EDC , N,N dicyclohexylcarbodimide DCC , 1 cyclonexyl 3 2 morpholinoethyl carbodiimide metho sWtoluenesulfo nate, or the like. The C02H case is also coupled by the activation method EDC or the active ester method, as described below in the tracer synthesis section.The CONRNH2 case is coupled in the same manner s,for the non aromatic amino case. The CNOR case is coupled directly to the poly amino acid . The CHI case is coupled to the poly amino acid by reductive amination. The poly amino acid is mixed with the CHO hapten and the resulting imine is reduced with sodium cyanoborohydride to yield alkylated amines on the poly amino acid . The Br and I cases also produce alkylated amines on the poly amino acid , but by direct coupling of the alkyl halide to the amine on the poly amino acid . The isocyanate NCO , isothiocyanate NSC , chloroformate OCOCI and chlorothioformate OCSC1 cases produce urea1 thiourea, carbamate and thiocarbamate linkages, respectively.This is accomplished by direct coupling of the hapten to the poly amino acid . The synthesis of the above haptens immunogen precursors where OOH, NH21 CH3, E or CI are accom plished in very similar ways. Figure 2 shows an im munogen precursor class in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the method of the present invention. The ideal starting material in general is the formyl derivative of the appropriate substituted benzoic acid for example, 5 formyl 2 methylbenzoic acid. These aldehydes can be condensed with a variety of reagents that will allow different derivatives to be prepared. Reaction with the appropriate Wittig reagent for example, Br Ph3P CH2 nR0followed by reduction can prepare homologous carboxylic acid .CO2H , nitrile CN and aldehyde CHO derivatives.The aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups would be initially protected as an acetal and ester, respectively, which are removed by hydrolysis.EMI15.1 Wittig reagents containing heteroatoms, unsaturations and or branching can be used to prepare other derivative forms as desired. In the case where Y bE2, the starting aldehyde must have the amine protected. The best protection is for Y to be a nitro group. The nitro group would be reduced in the second step when the olefin is reduced to yield the amino group. This route is preferred over others due to the great synthetic flexibility it provides. In the preparation of shorter carbon chain carboxylic acids or nitriles, the Knoevenagel reaction method is preferred. The aldehyde and malonic acid are condensed in the presence of a base, such as piperidine, morpholine, or the like, which results in the formation of an ,ss unsaturated carboxylic acid. This carboxylic acid can be coupled or reduced to the corresponding saturated carboxylic acid by the methods described earliz and then coupled. The nitrile is prepared by the same method with cyanoacetic acid instead of malonic acid.The nitrile is converted to. the imidate, see below, no then coupled. The carboxylic acid derivatives are ready to be coupled to produce immunogens. The nitrile derivatives are converted to alkoxy imidates by treating the nitrile with anhydrous alcohol and hydrogen chloride gas. The alkoxy midates are then ready for coupling.The hydrazide derivatives are prepared from the corresponding carboxylic acid derivatives by active ester coupling with hydrazine or by reacting hydrazine with the corresponding carboxylic ester derivative. The aldehyde derivatives are also ready to be coupled to produce immunogens. They are also convertible to the corresponding amines. This is accomplished by seductive amination or by the preferred conversion to the corre sponding oxime followed by reduction. For convenience, the unsaturated aldehydes obtained from the reaction of the Wittig reagent with the original aldehydes are converted to the oxime then the reductions of the olefin, oxime and, for Y N02, the nitro group, are effected simultaneously.These amino derivatives are then ready to be coupled to produce immunogens With the appropriate protection of the Y and COW groups, the amine is convertible to an isocyanate or thioisocyanate group by reaction of the amine with phosgene or thiophosgene. The isocyanate and thioisocyanate derivatives are then coupled to a poly amino acid and the protecting groups are removed The aldehyde derivatives can also be convertec to the corresponding alcohols by reduction. This can be accomplished with sodium borohydride, hydrogenation, or the like. The alcohols can be converted to the bromo or jodo derivatives with phosphorous tribromide, phosphorous triiodide, or the like also, the iodo derivative can be prepared from the bromo derivative by halogen exchange with sodium iodide or the like. The halo derivatives are then ready to be coupled. The nitrile derivatives can also be prepared from the halo derivatives by reaction with cyanide. The aldehydes can be condensed with aminohydroxy alkylcarboxylic acids, such as NH2OCM2CO2M, to produce substituted oxime derivatives. These are ready to be coupled to a poly amino acid . The oxime alkyl carboxylic acid derivatives can be partially reduced to the corresponding aminohydroxy alkylcarboxylic acid derivatives, which also are ready to be coupled to a poly amino acid . The same type of condensation and reduction can be accomplished with hydrazine and hydrazine derivatives. The alcohol derivatives can also be converted to the chloroformate and chlorothioformate derivatives.This is accomplished by reacting the alcohol, with Y OH or NH2 and COW protected, with phosgene or thiophosgene. The resulting chloroformates or chlorothioformates are coupled to a poly amino acid and then the protecting groups are removed. The case of Y OH provides a unique situation that allows easy access to carboxylic acid derivatives.The Friedel Crafts reaction of a cyclic anhydride with salicylic acid followed by reduction of the resulting ketone group with sodium borohydride results in alkyl carboxylic acid derivatives. This only works for 5 substituted alkyl carboxylic acid derivatives of salicylic acid. EMI18.1 The formyl derivatives are easily prepared from the halomethyl derivatives This is accomplished by oxidation, for example, with silver nitrate or 2 nitropropane, or the like, or by conversion to the corresponding hydroxymethyl derivative followed by oxidation to the aldehyde, for example, with pyridinium chlorochromate, pyridinium dichromate, or the like.The halomethyl derivatives can be prepared by halogenation of the corresponding methyl derivative by the standard N bromosuccinimiae method, or the like. The methyl derivatives are all known compounds and many are commercially available. In the case where Y CH3, a mixture of halogenated products are obtained. The desired bromomethyl derivative is not easily purified, so the mixture is converted to the corresponding hydroxymethyl derivative which can be easily purified see M. Nakazaki et al J. Org. Chem 1980, 45, 1428 35 . The alcohol can then be oxidized to the desired aldehyde as mentioned earlier. b. The Synthesis of the Tracers The tracers of the present invention are made by coupling a fluorescein moiety, or a derivative of fluorescein, to the general structure shown in Figure 10 when X is NH2, COOH, CNOR or OH. The fluorescein moiety can be linked to the amino, carboxyl, imidate or alkoxy functional group by an amide, an amidine, a urea, a thiourea, a carbamate, a thiocarbamate, triazinylamino or sulfonylcarbamate linkage, as shown in Figure 11.In the presently preferred embodiment, the fluorescein derivative is 6 carboxyfluorescein available from Calbiochem, La Jolla, Calif. , and this is coupled to a precursor shown in Figure 3. The 6 carboxyflucrescein is coupled to 5 aminomethyl salicylic acid by first forming the active ester of 6 carboxyfluorescein. The preferred active ester is N hydroxysuccinimide active ester and the preferred method is via N,N dicyclohexyl carbodiimide activation in dry pyridine. Other activating groups, such as l hydroxybenzotriazole, p nitrophenol, and carbonyldiimidazole, can be used and other solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide, can be used.The reactants are preferably coupled under conditions for forming amide linkages, and it is most preferred that active ester procedures be used.Usable tracers can be prepared from a variety of benzoic acid derivatives. All benzoic acid derivatives that have a terminal amino group, such as amino, hydrazinyl, hydrazido or the like, are coupled to carboxyfluorescein by the active ester method or the mixed anhydride method, and coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate, DTAF or alkoxyDTAF by simply mixing the to materials in solution.The amino group can be converted to the isocyanate and thioisocyanate groups by reaction with phosgene and thiophosgene, respectively. These are then condensed with aminofluorescein to produce the tracer. TheY OH,NH2 and COW groups require a protecting group for the conversion of the amino group to the isocyanate and the thioisocyanate groups which is removed after the coupling to fluorescein amine is complete. All benzoic acid derivatives that have a terminal carboxylic acid group, such as carboxylic acid, arninohydroxy alkylcarboxylic acid or the like, are coupled to aminofluorescein by the active ester method. All benzoic acid derivatives that have a terminal hydroxy group can be coupled to fluorescein by reaction with DTAF, G iodoacetamidofluoresceln or fluorescein isothiocyanate in solution. The hydroxy group can be converted to the chlorosulfonylcarbamoyl, chloroformate and chlorothioformate groups by reaction with chlorosulfonylisocyanate, phosgene and thiophosgene, respectively.These derivatives are then coupled to aminofluorescein in solution to produce the tracer. The Y OM,NH2 andCOW groups require a protecting group for the conversion of the hydroxy group to the chlorosulfonylcarbamoyl, chloroformate and chlorothioformate groups which is removed after the coupling to fluorescein amine is complete. All benzoic acid derivatives that have a terminal nitrile group are converted to imidates in anhydrous alcohol in the presence of hydrogen chloride gas The imidate is then coupled to fluorescein amine in solution to prepare the tracer The preparation of the various amino, carboxylic acid, hydroxy and nitrile derivatives of the benzoic acid derivatives, with the exception of Y Br1H and Z Z2 and or Z3 F, were described above in the îmmunogen preparation section. The derivatives where Br or H are prepared by the same method as Y C1. The derivatives where Z1, Z2 and or Z3 F are prepared from the corresponding amino derivatives The amino derivatives are prepared by reduction of the corresponding nitro derivatives.The nitro derivatives are prepared from known benzene derivatives by known methods. 4. The Assay The particular tracers and antibodies of the present invention have been found to produce surprisingly good results in fluorescence polarization assays for salicylates. Figure 1 shows the general structure of the class of salicylates that can be quantitatively determined in accordance with the present invention. The assay of the present invention provides a more rapid salicylate assay method than prior art methods, because it required no specimen treatment before analysis and because the assay system has minimal cross reactivity to salicylate like compounds. In accordance with the analytical methods of the present invention, i.e. the methods of determining salicylate by a fluorescence immunoassay procedure using the tracer compounds and immunogens of the invention, a sample containing or suspected of containing salicylate is intermixed with a biologically acceptable salt of a tracer and an antibody specific to salicylic acid and the tracer. The antibody is produced using the immunogen as described above. The salicylate and tracer compete for limited antibody sites, resulting in the formation of complexes. By maintaining constant the concentration of tracer and antibody, the ratio of salicylate antibody complex to tracer antibody complex that is formed is directly proportional to the amount of salicylate in the sample. Therefore, upon excitIng the mixture with linearly polarized light and measuring the polarization of the fluorescence emitted by a tracer and a tracer antibody complex, one is able to quantitatively determine the amount of salicylate in the sample. The results can be quantified in terms of net millipolarization units, span in millipolarization units and relative intensity. The measurement of millipolarization units indicates the maximum polarization when a maximum amount of the tracer is bound to the antibody in the absence 6f any salicylate. The higher the net millipolarization units, the better the binding of the tracer to the antibody. ite span is an indication of the difference between the net millipolarization and the minimum amount of tracer bound to the antibody. A larger span provides for a better numerical analvsis of data The intensity is a measure of the strength of the signal above background Thus, a higher intensity will give a more accurate measurement. The intensity is determined at about 0.9 to 1.1 nanomolar for the preferred tracers of the invention, as the sum of the vertically polarized intensity plus twice the horizontally polarized intensity. The intensity can range from a signal from about three times to about thirty times the background noise, depending upon the concentration of the tracer and other assay variables.For the purposes of the present invention, an intensity aimed roughly at about eight to ten times that of noise background is preferred Table I shows the results obtained with various embodiments of the present invention, in terms of span, millipolarization units and intensity. In all instances, bovine serum albumin BSA was used as the protein carrier. As seen from the data in Table I, an assay produced from an immunogen made from the hapten of Figure 17 used in combination with the tracer ofFigure 12 provides excellent results. Accordingly, this combination is presently the most preferred form of the invention.In addition, the hapten tracer combinations represented by the combinations of Figures 17 and 16, Figures 17 and 14, Figures 17 and 13 andFigures 20 and 13 also produced acceptable results and are alternative preferred combinations.

The pH may range from about 3 ti12 usually in the range of from about 5 to 10, most preferably from about 6 to 9. Various buffers may be used to achieve and maintain the pH during the assay procedure. Representative buffers include borate, phosphate, carbonate, tris, barbItal and the like. The particular buffer employed is not critical to the present invention, but the tris and phosphate buffers are preferred. The cation portion of the buffer will generally determine the cation portion of the tracer salt in solution. The preferred method of the improved assay of the present invention will now be discussed in detail.The assay is a homogeneous assay, which means that the end polarization readings are taken from a solution in which bound tracer is not separated from unbound tracer This is a distinct advantage over heterogeneous immunoassay procedures such as those where the bound tracer must be separated from the unbound tracer before a reading can be taken. The reagents for the fluorescence polarization assay of the present invention comprisp,antibodv specific for salicylate, tracer and salicylate pre treatment.Additionally, largely conventional solutions including a dilution buffer, salicylate calibrators and salicylate controls are desirably prepared Typical solutions of these reagents, some of which are described below, are commercially available in assay lkits fromAbbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois. All percentages expressed herein are weight volume unless otherwise indicated. The tracer formulation presently preferred is 78 nanomolar tracer in O.l molar tris buffer at pM 7.5 0.1 sodium dodecyl sulfate 0.1 sodium azide and 0.01 bovine gamma globulin The antiserum formulation comprises rabbit serum diluted with 0.1 molar tris buffer at RH 7.5 0.1 sodium azide 0,01 bovine gamma globulin and 2 ethylene glycol volume volume .The dilution buffer comprises 0.1 molar sodium phosphate at pM 7.5 0.1 sodium azide and 0.01 bovine gamma globulin. The pretreatment formulation comprises 0.1 molar tris buffer at pM 7.5 . 0.1 sodium azide 0.1 sodium dodecyl sulfate and 0.015 bovine gamma globulint Salicylate calibrators comprising salicylate in normal human serum at concentrations of 0.0, 50.0, 100.0, 200.0, 400.0 and 800.0 milligrams per liter, with O.l,ó sodium azide as a preservative are useful. Salicylate controls comprising salicylate in nonnal human serum are provided at concentrations of 75.0, 300.0 and 600.0 milligrams per liter with 0.1 sodium azide as a preservative are also useful. The preferred procedure is especially designed to be used in conjunction with the Abbott TDx. Analyzer available from Abbott Laboratories,Irving, Texas.FIffy microliters of serum or plasma are required. The calibrators, controls, or unknown samples are pipetted directly into the sample well of the TDxs sample cartridge. One of the advantages of this procedure is that the sample does not require any special preparation. The assay procedure from this point is fully automated. If a manual assay is being performed, then the sample is mixed with the pretreatment solution in dilution buffer and a background reading 15 taken. The tracer is then mixed with the assay. The antibody is then finally mixed into the test solution. After incubation, a fluorescence polarization reading is taken. The fluorescence polarization value of each calfbrator, control or sample is determined and is printed on the output tape of an instrument such as the Abbott x Analyzer. A standard curve is generatd r te instrument by plotting the polarization of each calibrator versus its concentration using a noninear regression analysis. The concentration of each cc. .t o or sample is read off the stored calibratLon curve a d printed on the output tape. With respect to the foregoing preferred procedure, It should be noted that the tracer, antibody, pretreatment solution, calibrators and controls should be stored between about 2 and about 80C while te dilution buffer should be stored at ambient temperature. A standard curve and controls should be run every two wees, with each calibrator and control run in duplicate. ControLs should be run with each batch, and all samples can be run in duplicate.
