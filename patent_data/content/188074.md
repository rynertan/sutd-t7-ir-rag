# Heald rod retention device.

## Abstract
A heald rod retention device comprising an elongate body 22 having a first body portion 22a adapted to guide reciprocal movement of the terminal end portion of a heald rod 15 and a second body portion 22b provided with a first latch 30 formation for engagement with a second co operating latch formation 31 on the heald rod 15 , the heald rod 15 being guided by the first body portion 22a so that during reciprocation the second latch formation 31 moves passed the first latch formation 30 without engage ment, at least one solenoid 23 activated magnetic pole piece mounted on the second body portion 22b and extending along the path of reciprocation of the heald rod 15 and which on activation of the solenoid 23 causes deflection of the terminal end portion of the heald rod 15 during its reciprocal movement to bring the first 30 and second latch formations 31 into engagement, and stop means 27 for limiting the amount of deflection of the heald rod 15 so as to prevent contact between the heald rod 15 and the pole piece 24 .
