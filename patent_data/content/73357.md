# ASSEMBLABLE AND STACKABLE CRATE OF PLASTIC MATERIAL AND APPARATUS FOR ASSEMBLING SAME

## Abstract
An assemblable and stackable crate of plastic material, particularly of injection molded plastic material, for the packaging of agricultural products, consists of a bottom F and of sidewalls P1, P2 which in a second operative step are secured in their erected position of use to the bottom F . Between each one of the sidewalls P1, P2 and the bottom F there are provided articulated connection means 1, 3, 4 5, 6 L which permit to raise the sidewalls P1, P2 , initially coplanar to the crate bottom F , in order to form the crate by an angular movement through about 90 . Fastening joints are also provided between each one of the sidewalls P1, P2 and the bottom F , as well as between two adjacent sidewalls P1 and P2 , each fastening joint consisting of at least two cooperating connection elements 7, 8 9, 10 12 11, 13 which are interengageable following the relative raising of the crate sidewall or sidewalls with respect to the bottom, and which are adapted for preventing the separa tion of the crate sidewalls from the bottom perpendicularly thereto, and also the separation of the sidewalls from each other.
