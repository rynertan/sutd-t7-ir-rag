# Cable supporting chain for machine parts moving in a straight line.

## Abstract
The cable supporting chain for machine parts moving in a straight line consists of modular link elements 1 sequentially assembled by means of a system of male and female joints at the ends of each element. These joints are formed by flanges 5 11A, 11B of ellipsoid shape being much longer than the central body portion of the element. A system of cavities 10 and protruding fingers 16 restricts the pivotal motion of the elements to the desired radius of curvature of the chain. The long ellipsoid flanges efficiently protect the pivot point of the link elements so as to prevent jamming of the chain by chips or other foreign matter during the operation in the workshop environment. The structure of the cable supporting chain can be better seen from Fig. 4 of the drawings.

## Description
Cable supporting chain for machine parts moving in a straight line This invention relates to a chain and particularly to a chain for machine parts which move in a straight line, such as the slides or saddles of machine tools, where it is necessary to support power transmission cables, hydraulic hoses and the like during the traverse movements of the machine, so as to protect the cables and hoses from torsional and tensile stresses and to maintain uniform their bending radius. A chain is already known which consists of two sets of pentagonal links, each link being jointed to the adjacent ones by link studs, while the two sets are connected by crosspieces adapted to carry cables, hoses and the like. Although such chains are useful, there are some drav backs, due to the fact that the links of each set have to be mounted alternate, i.e. inverted inside out in respect of adjacent links, and reinforcing plates have to be fitted inside links between those carrying the crosspieces, otherwise the chain would be liable to excessive bending.Assembly of the chain is therefore complicated and the presence of the reinforcing plates increases the number of the chain elements and therefore the cost. In a preceding patent of the same Applicant U.K. PatentSpecification NO 1 400 109 and DE AS 23 21 633 a cable supporting chain is disclosed, having modular link elements of a plastics material of suitable thickness and stiffness, which do not require reinforcing elements and may be sequentially assembled by means of joints comprising male and female portions, arranged at the ends of each element, so that said modular link elements are forming two sets interconnected by crosspieces supporting cables, hoses and the like. Such a cable supporting chain also provided means Ã²r applying coverings completely enclosing the cables and hoses or the like carried by the chain. Such a chain however, did not allow great loads nor allowed to change their bending radius by using always the same modular link elements.Furthermore the chain was subject to jamming because of chips and working materials which were introduced into the pivoting seats of the link elements. The elements of the cable holding chain according to said preceding patent had also a rather complicated form, thus requiring complicated and expensive molds, with the consequence of a higher cost of the modular link and a number of manufacturing rejections. Other cable supporting chains of the prior art which show at least some of the drawbacks discussed above, are to be found in German Patent Specifications DE OS 19 35 360,DE PS 963 077, DE OS 19 32 428, DE PS 11 31 480 and in U.S.Patent Specification NO 3 330 105. The cable supporting chain according to the present invention removes all these drawbacks, because its elements are of a much simpler shape and therefore they need less expensive molds. The chain allows to obtain a variable bending radius by using the same modular link elements, higher loads and a greater sturdiness because the modular elements are of much simpler shape and therefore require less complicated and expensive moulds. As a consequence the link height is greater and therefore it may contain more cables or be used for wider cables. The structure of the rotation system is different from the preceding articles and avoids that working chips and foreign matter present in the working environment enter the pivoting place of the elements so as to cause jamming of the chain. The cable supporting chain according to the presentInvention provides also for a system of male and female joints at the ends of each element, but said joints consist of flanges of considerable extension which mutually interpenetrate so as to protect the pivoting area of the elements which is in turn comprised of a cut or recessed portion made in the outer edge of male joint end, which can pivot in a limited way around a finger projecting from the innermost part of female joint end. An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which Fig. 1 is a lateral view from the outer side, partially sectioned, of a link modular element of the cable supporting chain according to the present invention Fig. 2 is an end view of the element of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a lateral view from the inner side of the same element of Fig. 1 Fig. 4 is a lateral view, partially sectioned, of two adjacent modular elements so as to show the mutual pivoting and joining system Fig. 5 is a top view of a portion of cable supporting chain according to the present invention Fig. 6 is a similar top view but on an enlarged scale, of a portion of cable supporting chain showing only one lateral set of elements and Fig. 7 is a perspective view of a modular cable supporting crosspiece with the two halves forming the crosspiece, shown slightly detached for a better understanding of the drawing. With reference now to the figures, the chain comprises two sides each formed by a set of link elements 1 made of moulded nylon reinforced with glass powder so as to obtain a greater stiffness, the two sides being connected together by crosspieces 2 for supporting the cables or hoses. Each modular link element 1 has a shape generally resembling an ellipsoid and has an outside face or surface 3 and an inside face or surface 4 as clearly shown in the figures of the accompanying drawings. The modular link elements 1 have a reduced central body and flanged ends comprising the terminal curved portions of the ellipsoid and having a male female structure so as to be joined each other in sequence. In other words, each modular element 1 has one male joint end and the opposite female joint end. Each male joint end has only one flange or protruding extension 5 provided with a hole 6 for passage of the connecting link stud. At both inside and outside faces and at both upper and lower edges the central body portion of the link element has two shoulders 7 and 8 facing the male joint flange as well as a central semicircular recess 9 for receiving the terminal curved portion of the female joint.On the terminal curved portion of male joint end or flange there is a cut or recessed cavity 10, which may be of variable width according to the radius of curvature intended for the specific cable supporting chain. The cavity 10 is not arranged centrally on the longitudinal axis of the link element, but it is offset in the curved end portion in the direction in which the cable supporting chain is intended to carry out its curve. In view of the material by which the elements are made, the width of the cut or recessed cavity may be varied by cutting away further pieces of material from the beveled. lateral walls of said cavity. Each female joint end is formed so as to be complementary with the above described male joint end, and comprises a projecting outside and inside flange or extension 71A and 11B, respectively, each provided vith a hole 12 for the passage of the connecting link stud 13 around which the mutual pivotal movement of elements is taking place The two flanges of the female joint end are forming a central slot 14 for introducing the male joint end of the next adjacent element, and the slot has its innermost part defined by a semicircular wall 15 receiving the terminal curved portion of the male joint end, said wall being centrally interrupted by a protruding finger 16 determining the pivoting stretch allowed for the cut or recessed cavity 10 of the male joint end. The link elements 1 are joined to one another by inserting the respective male portion in the female portion and fixing them by a link stud 13 which passing in the holes 6 and 12 of the flange 5 of the male portion and the flanges 11A and 11B of the female portion, respectively, is secured by a split pin 17. Each link element 1 has a central channel 18 on the inside surface, forming a seat for inserting a crosspiece 2 interconnecting the two sets of links and supporting the cables, hoses and the like. Along the channel 18 there are four holes 19 for screws 20 fastening the crosspieces, which may be of any suitable size and may be vertically displaced in respect of the chain links, according to the number and the diameter of cables and hoses to be supported. On the outside face each hole 19 has a flared inlet 21 so as to facilitate tightening of the screws 20. The link elements of one set of the chain are therefore arranged inverted insideoutside in respect of the other set of elements, so as to have the channel 18 arranged on the inside surface of both sets or dams oE the chain. The crosspieces 2 may be of any suitable length, that is the gauge of the power carrying chain may be different according to the number and size of the cables or hoses to be supported. For a maximum simplification of the modular nature of the system according to the present invention, the crosspieces 2 are consisting of two symmetrical halves 22 and 23, juxtaposed and then fixed to the modular link elements 1 by the above mentioned screws 20 which are screwed in holes 24 The crosspieces 2 are divided in two stretches by the intt mediate finger 25, so that with only one crosspiece modular element 2 it is possible to obtain three different gauges, whether the entire crosspiece, or only the longer or the shorter part of it is being used, by cutting the crosspiece at said intermediate finger.It is not necessary that the crosspieces 2 are applied at each link of the chain, but especially when cables or hoses of a considerable size and or stiffness are supported it is sufficient to apply one crosspiece 2 dvery two or three links of the chain. An important feature of the crosspieceC is that they have fingers or lateral attachments 26 allowing the insertion, on both upper and lower parts of the chain, of covering sheets formed from metal or other suitable material in order to enclose the cables or hoses arranged inside of the crcsspieces 2, thereby offering protection in both forward and return length of the chain, from chips or swarf falling from the machine tool, dust, humidity and any other foreign material or agent which could damage the cables or hoses. From the foregoing it is therefore apparent that the cable supporting chain according to the present invention has features of great advantage in respect of the knows cable supporting chains. It is also to be understood that several modifications, variations, additions and substitutions of details may be made to the cable supporting chain according to the present invention, without departing from spirit and scope thereof as defined in the appended claims.
