# Improvements in disc brakes for vehicles.

## Abstract
In a disc brake the application of the brake is initiated by angular movement of at least one pressure plate with respect to reaction member to cause the pressure plate to move axially into engagement with a friction disc which, in turn, is urged into engagement with a surface in a stationary housing. The angular movement is effected hydraulically by an actuator comprising a piston 5 working in a bore 4 of a cylinder 1 , the axis of which is substantially at right angles to that of the brake. The piston 5 acts through a part spherical rocking thrust coupling 10 associated with a pull rod 21 passing through the actuator with a substantial clearance, the inner end of the pull rod 21 being pivotally coupled to a lug on the pressure plate, and the outer end being adapted for connection to a hand lever 18 by means of which the pull rod 21 can be moved in a brake applying direction. A thrust member 9 is disposed between the piston 5 and the spherical rocking coupling 10 and is engagable with a thrust transmitting face on the piston 5 for sliding movement in a transverse direction with respect to the axis of the cylinder 1 to accommodate angular move ment of the pull rod 21 when the brake is applied. The thrust member 9 and the coupling 10 are biassed towards each other by a compression spring 11 so that the thrust member 9 is restrained from moving radially with respect to the coupling when the brake application is effected by the hand lever 18 . In another construction the spring 11 is omitted and the biassing is achieved by the inherent resilience of a boot 35 for sealing the outer end of the cylinder 1 .
