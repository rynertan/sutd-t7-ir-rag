# Etherification process for hexitols and anhydrohexitols.

## Abstract
A high yield process for the polyalkylation of hexitols and hexitol inner ethers is presented wherein aqueous dispersions of monoalkali metal alkoxides thereof in organic solvent are reacted with alkyl monohalides to first form the monoalkylated hexitols or hexitol inner ether and thereafter further alkylated by addition of reactants to form the completely alkylated derivative.
