# Quantity metering depositor for flowable media.

## Abstract
A positive displacement volumetric metering depositor particularly but not exclusively useful in food production equip ment has a continously rotating cylinder 24 with a diametri cally disposed metering piston or plunger 26 having the general form of an elongated, relatively narrow rectangular geometric solid of a desired height which moves cyclically across a diametrical cylinder passage during its rotation to receive a measured volume of media at the top of cylinder rotation and discharge such volume at the bottom of cylinder rotation. Cams and cam followers control such cyclic piston movement, and are adjustable to vary the volume of the measured charge by changing the relative positions of a pair of complementary component piston parts 26a, 26b together defining the composite metering piston 26 . The ejected volumetric charges of media enter a common discharge area 30 and are forced downwardly through a series of mutually distinct shaping die orifices 34 , at which incrementally advancing media may be sheared transversely to the die orifice to form a succession of identical discrete quantities.
