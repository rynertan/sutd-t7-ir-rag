# Method and apparatus for producing bag shaped packages.

## Abstract
Methods and apparatus allowing the automatic and continuous production of bag shaped packages each filled with a predetermined weight or volume of contents and having a cap body integrally attached thereto are described. A predetermined length of an elongate flat film is intermittently withdrawn from a supply thereof. A hole is punched in the film at predetermined intervals. The cap body portion of a cap body having a flange portion surrounding the cap body portion the inner diameter of which is larger than the inner diameter of the punched hole is inserted through the punched hole, the outer diameter of the cap body portion being less than the inner diameter of the hole. The flange portion of the cap body is heat sealed to the film. The flat film is formed into a generally tubular product configuration by bringing the longitudinally marginal edges of the film into contact with one another in an overlapped or juxtaposed relation und longitudinally heat sealing the said edges together. The tubular film is heat sealed transversely to the longitudinal heat seal to form an upwardly open bag shaped product which is filled with a specific predetermined weight or volume of content and again transversely heat sealed at a position upstream of the first seal to form a closed filled bag shaped product and to form the first transverse seal for the next adjacent bag shaped product. The filled packages are cut off along the centre line of the transverse seals.
