# A process for the surface treatment of copper products.

## Abstract
A process for surface treating copper products, for example, a copper foil to be used for a copper clad laminate, is provided, which process comrpises electrolytically de positing a binary alloy consisting of 95 to 20 by weight of zinc and 5 to 80 by weight of nickel, on the surface of a copper product to form a coating layer, followed by laminat ing the resulting copper product onto a base material under heating and pressure, said binary alloy being converted during the lamination into a ternary alloy of zinc, nickel and copper constitutes a boundary layer having a superior bond strength between the copper product and the base material. The resulting surface treated copper product has superior bond strength to a base material and is resistant to etching solutions, acids etc.
