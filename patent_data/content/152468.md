## Description
This invention relates to DNA sequences, plasmids comprising them, unicellular organisms containing said plasmids and DNA probes. The present invention utilizes recombinant DNA techniques to insert a DNA sequence coding for M protein, or a portion thereof, into a DNA plasmid, such as viral DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA, such that the plasmid is capable of replicating and directing expression of the M protein gene in a bacterial host or other single cell system. A DNA probe useful in a hybridization screening method is described herein for the examination of clinical isolates in cases of suspected streptococcal infection. A specific molecular probe is used based on the entire gene or a segment of the gene coding for a It is well recognized that acute rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis are sequelae of Group A streptococcal infection. In developing countries of the tropics and subtropics, rheumatic heart disease is currently the most common form of cardiac damage. Prevalence rates of this disease as high as 22 23 per thousand have been reported in school age children in urban slums of some developing countries of the world. It is estimated that in India alone, as many as six million children may be afflicted. Although the exact mechanisms of disease causation are not understood, it is clear that rheumatic fever, as well as acute nephritis, follows infection with The streptococcal M protein is the major virulence factor of this bacterium by virtue of the fact that it imparts to the organism resistance to phagocytic attack. Antigenic variation is the primary mechanism by which the Group A streptococcus is able to evade the host s immune response and thus cause disease in man. Resistance to Group A streptococcal infection is dependent upon the presence of type specific antibodies to the M protein, a fibrillar molecule found on the surface of the organism. In addition to a number of nontypable strains, about seventy distinct Group A streptococcal M types are currently recognized. Despite the fact that antibodies cross reactive among certain M types are common, only antibodies prepared against the homologous type are capable of initiating phagocytosis of the organisms The fact that specific antiserum can be prepared to Group A streptococci has made it possible to detect streptococcal infection by subjecting clinical isolates, such as those obtainable by throat swab, to serological testing. The identification of group A streptococci in an infection requires the isolation of the organism in pure culture, extraction of the group specific carbohydrate, and reaction with group specific antiserum. A clinical test for streptococcal infection that could be based upon a property common only to all pathogenic strains would thus be highly desirable. Recombinant DNA technology involves the technique of DNA cloning whereby a specific DNA fragment is inserted into a genetic element called a vector which is capable of replication and transcription in the host cell. The vector can be either a plasmid or a virus. Plasmids are small, circular molecules of double stranded DNA that occur naturally in both bacteria and yeast, where they replicate as independent units as the host cell proliferates. These plasmids generally account for only a small fraction of the total host cell DNA, and often carry genes that confer resistance to antibiotics. These genes, and the relatively small size of the plasmid DNA, are exploited in recombinant DNA technology. The inserted DNA fragment of a recombinant DNA molecule may be derived from an organism which does not exchange information in nature with the host organism, and may be wholly or partially synthetically made. Construction of recombinant DNA molecules using restriction enzymes and ligation methods to produce recombinant plasmids has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,237,224, issued to Cohen and Boyer. The recombinant plasmids thus produced are introduced and replicated in unicellular organisms by means of transformation. A different method for introducing recombinant DNA molecules into unicellular organisms is described by Collins and Hohn in U.S. Pat. No. 4,304,863. This method utilizes a packaging transduction system with bacteriophage vectors. Because it is supercoiled, plasmid DNA can easily be separated from the DNA of the host cell and purified. For use as cloning vectors, such purified plasmid DNA molecules are cut with a restriction nuclease and then annealed to the DNA fragment that is to be cloned. The hybrid plasmid DNA molecules produced are then reintroduced into bacteria that have been made transiently permeable to macromolecules competent . Only some of the treated cells will take up a plasmid and these cells can be selected for the antibiotic resistance conferred on them by the plasmid since they alone will grow in the presence of antibiotic. As these bacteria divide, the plasmid also replicates to produce a large number of copies of the original DNA fragment. At the end of the period of proliferation, the hybrid plasmid DNA molecules are purified and the copies of the original DNA fragments are excised by a second treatment with the same endonuclease. Regardless of the method used for construction, the recombinant DNA molecule must be compatible with the host cell, A general diagnostic method for the detection of pathogenic microorganisms may be devised if a DNA segment of the genome expected to be found in such organisms is available in pure form. If it is, the DNA segment may be used as a hybridization probe, by tagging it with a chemical, enzymatic or radioisotopic reporter group. Grunstein and Hogness Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. Methods and compositions are provided for the cloning and expression of the streptococcal M protein gene in single cell organisms. Through the use of the streptococcal M protein gene or a fragment thereof as a molecular probe, a method is provided for the diagnostic identification of pathogenic streptococci in body tissues and fluids. In this method, DNA is extracted from microbial isolates and examined for complementary nucleotide sequences by hybridization to the molecular probe. By this means large numbers of isolates may be screened for the presence of streptococci with relative ease, high sensitivity and accuracy. The result is a screening test offering marked advantages over the more cumbersome serological diagnostic tests presently in use. The present invention may be more fully understood by reference to the following detailed description of the invention and the figures in which FIG. 1 not to scale represents the construction of pJRS42, a recombinant plasmid derived from streptococcal DNA fragments and pJB8. Various restriction sites within the streptococcal DNA are not shown. FIG. 2 represents a restriction map of pJRS42.13. This plasmid was derived from pJRS42 by digestion with FIG. 3 is a restriction map of various subclones of plasmid pJRS42.13, which contains the genes coding for the M6 protein of type 6 Group A streptococcus. The clear boxes define clones that express M6 protein, and the shaded boxes denote clones that do not. The vector pBR322 was used in all cases except 42.21 and 42.19, which are in M13 and in pUC8 and pUC9, respectively. The arrow above the restriction map indicates the direction of transcription of the gene encoding type 6 M protein emm6 , and the approximate extent of the gene. The end of the molecule corresponding to the amino terminus of the protein is denoted by N . FIG. 4 is a representation of a portion of the DNA sequence of the FIG. 5 represents agar gel electrophoretic analysis of DNA hybridization with the Therefore, this invention relates to a DNA sequence encoding a The recombinant plasmids, constructed as described herein, provide for host cell procaryotic or eucaryotic production of a streptococcal M gene. Such plasmids enable the generation of large quantities of DNA. The particular embodiment described herein concerns the M6 gene. However, the DNA molecules described herein are not limited to the M6 gene and DNA encoding any of the Group A streptococcal M proteins may be used. Generic applicability to all M genes is apparent from the hybridization data presented below, which indicate structural similarity among all 56 M protein genes tested. The M protein gene described herein, or a fragment thereof, may be used as a molecular probe in a diagnostic test for streptococci. The basis of the test is the fact that pathogenic streptococci possess gene sequences that are complementary to segments of the M protein gene of this invention. Such gene complementarity may be readily detected by isolating microbial DNA from a suspected streptococcal infection and annealing the DNA with the molecular probe under appropriate conditions on a solid support or in liquid medium. The occurence of hybridization may readily be detected by attachment to the probe of a suitable reporter group. Streptococcal organisms might be isolated from a point of infection in any body tissue or fluid, but a simple throat swab would be the most likely source. The microorganisms thereby obtained, which would probably be a mixed culture, can be used directly The extracted DNA is generally denatured by the addition of aqueous alkali and then washed with a buffered solution. The particular concentrations of alkali, buffer constituents, etc., depend on the conditions of the experiment and may be readily determined by routine experimentation. The denatured M protein gene probe of this invention may then be added to the microbial DNA preparation and permitted to hybridize at points of DNA sequence complementarity. Specific binding will be recognized as that remaining after extensive washing of the hybridization mixture to eliminate non specific binding. The hybridization may be carried out in one of numerous solutions that have been developed and are acceptable for the purpose. Falkow The specific values of other hybridization parameters, such as time and temperature, and the method employed are not essential to this invention. Methods described by Gall and Pardue Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. The molecular probe upon which the present invention is based may encompass all or only a portion of the M protein gene, as long as enough of the gene sequence is retained to permit specific hybridization to occur. Such hybridization may be detected even at extremely low levels by coupling an appropriate reporter group to the molecular probe. The probe may be radiolabeled e.g. labeled with ³²P, ³H, ¹⁴C, ³⁵S etc. , or it may be tagged with a chemical or enzymatic reporter group. For example, colorimetric detectors coupled to biotinylated probes may be used in conjunction with avidin derivatives such as fluorescein avidin, rhodamine avidin, or enzyme linked avidin. The following Example of a method for the cloning and expression of the M6 protein in The source of the M6 protein gene was A large piece of streptococcal DNA was to be cloned in order to reduce the number of candidate In the present invention, vector pJB8 was digested with The vector with streptococcal DNA inserted was packaged into lambda phage heads The possibility that the M protein gene would be expressed in A rapid assay was developed to recognize the clone of The assay involved transferring the lysed colonies to be tested to nitrocellulose filters, rinsing the filters in bovine serum albumin to reduce non specific affinity of the filter for proteins, reacting the filter with antiserum to purified LysM6 that had been exhaustively pre absorbed with To detect the M6 protein, the antiserum was diluted over 1000 fold. There was no detectable reaction with Among 335 colonies screened, one reacted strongly with antiserum to purified M6 protein. The chimeric plasmid present in this strain was named pJRS42. The ability of this Plasmid pJRS42 was treated with The identity of M protein molecule produced in The molecular weight of the M protein produced by the The M6 protein was purified as follows The The M protein in the crude periplasmic contents was purified from other contaminating proteins by column chromatography. The crude periplasmic preparation was dialyzed against 5mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer pH 5.5 and applied to a column of carboxymethyl cellulose. The column was washed with three volumes of the same buffer and the adherent proteins eluted in one step with 100mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0. The eluted protein containing the M protein was applied directly to a hydroxylapatite column equilibrated in 25mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of 200mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 and the adherent M protein was then eluted with 400mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0. This method resulted in a highly purified M protein preparation as determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis. Amino terminal sequence analysis of the purified The purified LysM6 preparation exhibited a multiple banding pattern previously observed with the M6 molecule, which is probably due to degradation during extraction and purification. The three major bands corresponded to apparent molecular weights of 51,000, 52,000 and 53,000 daltons. The size heterogeneity of the M6 preparation probably resulted from differences at the carboxy terminal region of the protein since, during amino terminal sequence analysis of this preparation by sequential degradation, only a single amino acid residue was released at each step. Since the bands from the pJRS42 containing clone that reacted with anti M6 antibodies are all larger molecular weights 55,000, 57,000, 59,000 daltons than any from the streptococcal preparation, this suggested that pJRS42 contained the entire structural gene for the M6 protein. This was supported by the fact that this molecular size correlated well with the reported size of M protein secreted from protoplasts and L forms of type 12 streptococci molecular weight 58,000 daltons . Thus, the proteins in the In addition, the M protein isolated from secreting streptococcal L forms and protoplasts appeared more homogeneous. There are several possible explanations for the differences in mobilities of the An Ochterlony immunodiffusion comparison of M protein of The results of this double diffusion experiments gel not shown supported the conclusion that the extract of the To locate the gene encoding type M6 protein emm6 , plasmid pJRS42.13, described in Section 6.3, The results of M6 protein expression analysis for many of these cloned DNA fragments are shown in FIG. 3. The clones delineated by clear blocks produced a protein that was reactive with anti M6 antiserum, while those shown as shaded blocks did not. Although some of the reactive clones such as pJRS42.19 contained too little streptococcal DNA to encode the entire M6 protein, their expression products were evidently of sufficient size to show antigenic reactivity with the polyclonal antiserum. To learn more about the orientation of the emm6 gene within the cloned DNA fragments, the streptococcal DNA in plasmid pJRS42.19 was ligated into the Following ligation of the streptococcal DNA fragment of pJRS42.19 into M13mp8 and mp9 Messing and Veira, These results showed that the The M6 protein produced in A suitable probe containing a large portion of the emm6 gene was prepared by treating plasmid pJRS42.13 with Phage lysin was used to lyse cells of Group A streptococci, by the method of Fischetti After incubation for 30 minutes at 37 The bacterial strains examined include Dot hybridization was performed on the extracted DNA samples using the procedure for detection of specific DNA sequences described by Kafatos To carry out the hybridization, the DNA extracts from the various microbial sources were denatured in 0.6 M NaOH for 15 minutes at room temperature, and then for 10 minutes at 0 A summary of the results of these studies is shown in Table 3. Overall, the dot blot test showed hybridization between the Group G streptococci have also been reported to cause a wide range of human infections. Although it is uncertain whether the virulence of these organisms is always due to the presence of an M like cell surface protein, it may be that it is. Examination of three strains of group G streptococci isolated from human infections revealed the presence in the strains of a type 12 M cell surface protein Maxted and Potter, J. Genl. Microbiol. Among the group A strains tested were three that are functionally M The results of the dot blot tests were confirmed by a study in which DNA from various M type group A streptococcal strains was extracted and digested with In FIG. 5, lane 1 represents 10.9, 7.74, 5.15, 2.44, 1.80 and 0.60 kb DNA molecular size markers that had been labeled with ³² The following listed In the present specification the base pair sizes given for nucleotides are approximate and are used for purposes of description.
