# Method for producing a platinum catalyst on a support material.

## Abstract
Method for producing highly dispersed platinum catalyst particles of less than 5 mm diameter on a support material for use in fuel cells, by mixing chloroplatinic acid and sodium dithionite in water to provide a platinum containing colloidal dispersion which may be adsorbed on the support material. Hydrogen peroxide can by mixed with the chloroplatinic acid and sodium dithionite to improve the stability of the platinum containing colloidal dispersion.
