# Containers for use in electrostatic spraying.

## Abstract
A container for the electrostatic spraying of liquids especially pesticides is described. It has an integral conductive spray nozzle, formed of two concentric tubes, in which an arrangement of axial ribs and grooves provides a liquid pathway to the nozzle mouth. Air is bled into the container through an extended pathway provided by a helical groove.
