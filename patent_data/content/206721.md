# Glass fibres.

## Abstract
A glass fibre 10 consisting of a core 12 provided with cladding 14 is coated with a single coating 16 of a metal, alloy or dielectric capable of withstanding temperatures in excess of 300 C and preferably 500 C. The coating is deposited by a vapour phase reaction process occurring on the surface of the fibre. The fibre may be solid as shown or hollow.
