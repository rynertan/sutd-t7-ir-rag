# Hydrocarbon conversion process and apparatus.

## Abstract
Process and apparatus for a hydrocarbon conversion process, for example thermal cracking, in which feedstock is converted in a heated furnace, the furnace being heated by burning a mixture of fuel and preheated air. The preheat ed air is obtained by passing air through successive com pression, heating and gas turbine expansion zones, the work thereby obtained from the gas turbine expansion zone being used, at least in part, to compress hydrocarbon pro cess gas produced in the furnace.
