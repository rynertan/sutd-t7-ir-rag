# Apparatus and method for reverse roll feed of shingled blanks.

## Abstract
An elongated, cylindrical roll 42 , having a surface 46 machined to a predetermined microfinish, is mounted in place of the conventional chromium plated fixed gate in a known type of blank feeder 22 . In such feeders, the upper stretch 36 of the conveyor 32 advances blanks 25 from a high stack 24 , in a bottom feed magazine 23 , along a path 39 , in shingled formation 67 to continuously resupply a low stack in the hopper of a folder gluer. The elongated roll 42 is reversely rotated, at a surface speed equal to the speed of the upper stretch 36 . The leading edges 64 of the lowermost blanks 25 in the high stack 24 are barred by leaf springs 58, 59 from contacting the rear surface 46 of the reversely rotating roll 42 except for an arcuate area, in the lower rear quadrant, defined by an angle of 30 rearwardly from the bottom longitudinal centre line 45 of the roll 42 .
