# Silver catalyst for production of ethylene oxide from ethylene, and process for production thereof.

## Abstract
A catalyst for the production of ethylene oxide from ethylene, said catalyst comprising a porous carrier com posed of a molded article of a refractory material and at least silver grains deposited on the carrier, wherein A silver is distributed on the outside surface of the carrier and on the inner surfaces of the pores of the carrier, B silver grains distributed on the inner surfaces of the pores of the carrier have an average diameter of 0.05 to 0.4 micron, and C the loading S of silver on the outside surface layer of the catalyst and the loading I of silver on the innermost layer of the catalyst satisfy the following expression 1 0.65S and a process for producing a catalyst for the production of ethylene oxide from ethylene, which comprises impregnat ing an aqueous solution containing a silver salt and an amine as a complex forming agent in a porous carrier composed of a molded article of a refractory material, and heating the carrier with superheated steam to deposit silver on the carrier.
