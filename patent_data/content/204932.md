# Displacement generating device.

## Abstract
In a displacement generating device, a voltage signal generator 12 produces a triangular wave drive voltage signal Sv so as to drive a piezoelectric element 10 in a desired vibration mode. The voltage signal generator 12 is connected to the piezoelectric element 10 through a differentiator 14 and a constant current supply 26 . The drive voltage signal Sv is differentiated by the differentiator 14 , and is then supplied as a rectangular wave voltage signal to the constant current supply 26 . Since constant currents having two levels are alternately supplied to the piezoelectric element 10 , an amount of charge accumulated in the piezoelectric element 10 , can be controlled linearly during the current supply time. As a result, since displace ment of the piezoelectric element 10 is linearly controlled in proportion to the amount of charge, it coincides with the triangular waveform of the drive voltage signal Sv . A vibration mode free from hysteresis can be obtained.
