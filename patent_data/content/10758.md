# Alkylacrylate polymer composition, process for the preparation thereof and laminate structure having this composition as a pressure sensitive adhesive.

## Abstract
A pressure sensitive adhesive comprises the reaction product of A at least one alkyl acrylate liquid polymer containing both terminal and random hydroxyl functionali ty, as well as sulfide and optionally also disulfide linkages near the terminal portions of the polymer molecule B at least one prepolymer of a polyester glycol or a polyalkylene ether glycol with an excess amount of an aromatic diiso cyanate and C at least one alkanediol containing from 3 to 10 carbon atoms. Use of the alkanediol improves 180 peel strength and maintains U.V. stability of the adhesive.
