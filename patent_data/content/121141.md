## Description
CHILL GELABLE POLYMERS AND THEIR USE The invention relates to polymers which are capable of being chill gelled. More particularly, the present invention relates to polymers of crosslinkedN alkyl substituted acrylamide having a solubility parameter 6 from 13 to 16 at 25 C. Gelatin is an extremely useful vehicle in photographic elements because it has the ability to be coated and immediately chill set to retain the integrity of the wet, coated layer during drying.Aside from the obvious problem of running off the support, the property of quick setting is a very important property in photographic coatings to maintain the homogeneity of the layer s . For example, in a single layer, chill setting prevents settling of silver halide grains, or settling or floating to the surface of other insoluble materials, e.g., insoluble matte beads. In multilayer coatings, chill setting prevents intermixing of separate layers. Chillsetting is therefore an immediate step to prevent run off, and intermixing, and to retain homogeneity. Gelatin, however, has limited resistance to abrasion, humidity and temperature. The incorporation of polymers or substitution of polymers for gelatin in photographic layers would be desirable to obtain enhanced resistance to abrasion, humidity and temperature, however, synthetic polymers, in general, do not have the desirable chill gelation capabilities of gelatin. Various polymers have been suggested for the preparation of microgel dispersions to modify properties of textile products and for other diverse uses. U.S Patent 3,455,686 describes the use of isopropylacrylamide copolymerized with methanolacrylamide in timing layers for image transfer film units. These polymers, however, do not have a solubility parameter from 13 to 16 at 250C and are not chill gelable and an extended drying time is necessary during film production. U.S. Patents 3,728,258 and 4,172,066 describe the use of crosslinked polyacrylamides in microgels, but these polymers, also, are not chill gelable.Thus, a polymer which is chill gelable and has good abrasion, humidity and temperature resistance would be highly useful in photographic elements. The problem this invention solves is that of providing a polymer which has good abrasion, humidity and temperature resistance which properties are not available in gelatin and which is, as gelatin, chill gelable. This problem can be solved with a crosslinked, chill gelable polymer comprising a 30 to 97 weight percent of polymerized N alkyl substituted acrylamide, b 3 to 25 weight percent polymerized crosslinking monomer having at least two addition polymerizable groups per molecule and c O to 60 weight percent of one or more other polymerized monomers characterized in that said polymer has a solubility parameter 6 from 13 to 16 at 250C with the proviso that said other monomers c comprise less than 5 weight percent of cationic monomers, less than 15 weight percent of free acid monomers and less than 3 weight percent of metal or ammonium salts of acid monomers. These polymers are chill gelable and have excellent resistance to abrasion, humidity and temperature. One embodiment of the present invention comprises a microgel dispersion comprising the abovedescribed polymer. In another embodiment, a photographic element comprises a support having thereon a layer comprising the polymer. A still further embodiment comprises the use of the dispersion of the aqueous microgel for coating a substrate. This use entails a contacting said substrate with an aqueous dispersion, b chill setting the coating at a temperature of less than 100C and c drying the coated support initially at a ry bulb temperature of greater than 10 C, preferably greater than 1500 and less than 20 C, then gradually increasing the drying temperature to a final wet bulb temperature of 20 to 280C characterized in that the dispersion contains the chill gelable polymer described above. The chill gelable polymer comprises from 30 to 97 weight percent of polymerized N alkyl substituted acrylamide. The preferred acrylamide isN isopropylacrylamide. Other acrylamides are useful in crosslinked polymers having the requisite solubility parameter Thus, N alkyl substituted acrylamides such as N n butylacrylamide, N,N diethylacrylamide and N n propylacrylamide are also useful herein. The most preferred polymers comprise 60 to 97 weight percent of polymerized N isopropylacrylamide. The polymer also comprises from 3 to 25 weight percent of one or more polymerized crosslinking monomers having at least two sddition polymerizable groups per molecule. These crosslinking monomers are generally well known in the art. The preferred crosslinking monomers contain acrylamido or nieth acrylamido groups to facilitate polymerization with the N alkyl substituted acrylamides. Examples of useful crosslinking monomers include N,N methylenebisacrylamide N,N methylenebismethacrylamide ethylene dimethacrylate 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 propylene diacrylate divinylbenzene monot2,3 bis methacryloyloxy propyl phosphate N,N bis methycryloyl urea triallyl cyanurate allyl acrylate, allyl methacrylate N allylmethacrylamlde 4,4 isopropylidenediphenylene diacrylate 1, 3 butylene diacrylate 1,4 cyclohexidimethylene dimethacrylate 2,2 oxydiethylene dimethacrylate d ivinyloxymethane ethylene diacrylate ethylidene diacrylate propylidene dimethylacrylate 1, 6 diacrylamidohexane 1,6 hexamethylene d jacrylate 1, 6 hexamethylene dimethacrylate phenylethylene dimethacrylate tetramethylene dimethacrylate 2,2,2 trichlorethylidene dimethacrylate ethylenebis oxyethylene diacrylate ethylenebis oxyethylene dimethacrylate ethylidyne trimethacrylate propylidyne triacrylate vinyl allyloxyacetate 1 vinyloxy 2 allyloxyethane 2 crotonoyloxyethyl methacrylate diallyl phthalate and 2 5 phenyl 2,4 pentydienoyloxy ethyl methacrylate. The preferred crosslinking monomer is N Nt methylene bisacrylamide. The polymer can also comprise O to 60 weight percent of polymerized other monomers with the proviso that said other monomers comprise less than 5 weight percent of cationic monomers, less than 15 weight percent of free acid monomers such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid and 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid, and less than 3 weight percent of metal or ammonium salts of acid monomers so that the polymer has the requisite solubility. Exemplary water soluble monomers useful herein which are non ionic include acrylamide allyl alcohol N methylolacrylamide N isobutoxymethyl acrylamide N isobutoxymethyl methycrylamide glyceryl methacrylate 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate N isopropylacrylamide N vinyl a caprolactam N methylmeth√Öacrylamide methacrylamide maleimide 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate N methylolmaleimide methacryloylurea N 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylamide N vinylsuccinimide N vinylphthalimide 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylate N vinyl 2 pyrrolidone 2 acrylamido 2 hydroxymethyl 1 1,3 propanediol N, N dimethylmethacrylamide N methylacrylamide N vinyl N 2 hydroxyethyl succinamide N vinylcarbazole N isopropylmethacrylamide and N,N dimethylacrylamide. The useful polymers of the present invention have a solubility parameter 6 from 13 to 16 at 2500. The solubility parameter concept is based on regular solution theory and has found many practical applications in polymer science, especially the paint and lacquer industries, as an empirical tool for determining polymer solvent compatibilities. In particular, the solubility parameter, 6, is related to the Flory Huggins interaction parameter, Xl, which determines whether a given polymer solvent system will exist as a single phase solution or as two phases solvent phase and sol phase . In the context of microgel latexes, the single phase would be represented by the microgel and the two phase system by the latex. In the solubility parameter theory, the parameters 61 solvent and 62 solute are measures of the intermolecular attractions present in the solvent and the amorphous polymers, respectively.For volatile liquids, 61 can be experimentally determined. However, 62 for non volatile materials such as polymers is not experimentally accessible and must be estimated. For such materials, a range of 2 is estimated by comparison of polymer solubility and solvent solubility parameters.The more similar the solubility parameters, the more likely is dissolution of the polymer. There are also several procedures available for estimating the solubility parameters of polymers from their chemical structures. There are four recognized types of polymersolvent interactions. The first, common to all molecules, is called dispersion forces and results from the fluctuation of atomic dipoles because of the presence of a positive nucleus with electrons surrounding it. The second type of interaction arises because of the presence of permanent dipoles in the interacting molecules. Such dipole dipole interactions are characteristic of polar molecules. A related third type of interaction results when a permanent dipole on one molecule induces a temporary dipole in another to create a relatively weak interaction similar to dipole dipole interaction. The fourth type of interaction is that which involves hydrogen bonding. Because hydrogen bonding is relatively poorly understood, the presence of such interactions is often a complicating factor in the analysis of solubility parameter data. In the case of aqueous systems, since the solvent is a constant, it is safe to eliminate all factors due to hydrogen bonding and approach the solubility parameter problem based upon the dispersion forces and dipole interactions involved. Using the standard literature techniques see C. M. Hansen, J. Paint Tech., 39 505 , 104 117 1967 , the solubility parameters of a number of representative co and terpolymers prepared for latex microgel application are calculated. In the table below are given the compositions, the solubility parameter, 62, and phase condition microgel or latex present at the temperature of the calculation 25 C, in this case . Because the solubility parameters vary with temperature, marginal systems will exhibit upper and lower critical solution temperatures, as are exhibited by the N isopropyl acrylamide polymers. As a result, compositions which are latexes at 2500 may show microgel formation at lower temperatures see Table I . Comparing the 6 2 values of the polymers with their solution characteristics, there exists a region of 62 within which the polymers exhibit the latex microgel transition over the normal temperature range 20 50 C . In this case, the range of is 13 16. Above 16, the polymer exists as a gel at all temperatures e.g., poly N,N dimethylacrylamide co N,N methylenebisacrylamide 90 10 , 62 16.3 . Below 13, the polymer remains a latex e.g., poly N n butylacrylamide co methylenebisacrylamide 90 15 , 2 12.81 .

The above polymer compositions are crosslinked, chill gelable microgels having a solubility parameter of from 13 to 16 at 25 C. Chill gelable microgel means that in aqueous dispersions the polymer exists above 500C as small latex particles, generally having average diameter of less than 0.5 p preferably less than 0.3 V indicative of little swelling, the dispersion thus having low dispersion viscosity typical of latex dispersions and at temperatures at or below l00C the dispersions are more translucent and are viscous gels of highly swollen polymer having particle sizes above 0.5 , generally 0.8 to 1.1 ii, the gel having a Brookfield viscosity of at least 1000 cp at l00C when the solid content of the dispersion is 8 to 10 or higher. Preferred polymers described above are those having recurring units having the structure EMI16.1 wherein Z is a linking group R and t are individually hydrogen or methyl Rl represents recurring units in the polymer of one or more polymerized addition polymerizable comonomers R2 is alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or aryl R3 is hydrogen, aryl or alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms R5 is H or CH n is l or 2 x represents 30 to 97 weight percent, y represents 3 to 25 weight percent and z represents O to 30 weight percent with the proviso that Rl comprises less than 5 percent by weight of the polymer that is derived from cationic monomers, less than 15 percent by weight of the polymer that is derived from free acid monomers and less than 3 percent by weight of polymer that is derived from metal or ammonium salts of acid monomers. In the above structure, Z is a linking group between separate polymer backbone chains and can be a heteroatom linking group such as an ester, amide, urylenedicarbonyl, urethane, ether, imino, or the like linking group, or an n l valent nucleus of one or a combination of aliphatic, aromatic, cyclic, and heterocyclic nuclear groups having O to n 1 heteroatom linking groups aforementioned, or combinations thereof. Thus, Z has one covalent bond to each CW CR group present. Preferred nuclei include alkylene bis iminocarbonyl such as methylenebis imino carbonyl alkylenebis oxyearbonyl such as ethylene bis oxyearbonyl , ureylenedicarbonyl or arylene such as phenylene. R represents recurring units of 1 or more other polymerized addition polymerizable compounds such as previously described. R2 is a straight or branched chain alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, including substituted alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, chloroethyl, butyl and isobutyl. R3 is hydrogen or a straight or branched chain alkyl as described for R2. Preferred polymers useful herein include polytN isopropylacrylamide co N,N methylenebis acrylamide 90 10 , poly N isopropylacrylamide co acrylamide co N,N methylenebisacrylamide 70 85 5 20 10 , poly N isopropylacrylamide co 2hydroxyethyl acrylate co N,N methylenebisacrylamide 70 85 5 20 10 and poly N isopropylacrylamide coethyl methacrylate co N,Nt methylenebisacrylamide 70 85 5 20 10 . The above polymers generally have molecular weights of from 100,000 to 1,000,000 and preferably from 100,000 to 500,000. The particle size of the polymers is preferably 0.2 to 0.5 p. The above polymers are formed by randomly polymerising the monomers together. The polymerization can be carried out using catalysts such as potassium persulfate and 4,4 azobis 4 cyanovaleric acid and heating for a period of 60 minutes to 180 minutes at 6000 to 8000. The resulting polymer is hydrophilic and the crosslinking must be done during polymerization, rather than after polymerization to form a latex, 4.e. dispersion rather than solution polymer, and attain the chill gelable microgel properties. The above polymers are prepared in the form of chill gelable microgel dispersions by simply poly meriting the selected monomers in aqueous dispersions by conventional emulsion polymerization techniques at elevated temperature, e.g., above 60 C, preferably at 7000 to 8000 to form a polymer latex, and cooling to ambient temperature. The resulting microgel dispersions preferably contain 10 to 20 percent solids and gelatin is preferably added to the dispersions. The dispersion can also comprise addenda such as development inhibitors or accelerators, coating aids and hardeners. The microgel dispersions are quite useful in formulating layers of photographic elements. The microgel dispersions are coated on a suitable photographic support such as poly ethylene terephthalate , glass or metal and first congealing at less than 1000 preferably approximately 4.5 C chill gelling and then air drying at temperatures of 1800. The element can be overcoated with a layer or series of layers after chill gelling and prior to drying. The coating for photographic elements preferably contains from 20 to 80 weight percent of gelatin. The layer, after chill gelation, is preferably coated on, or incorporated in light sensitive emulsion layers or layers containing photographic addenda by multicoating operations and then dried at elevated temperatures. At high or low temperature, coated layers of the polymers are insoluble in, but permeable by, conventional processing solutions. The following examples are presented to illustrate more fully the invention.Example 1 Preparation of microgel composition comprising poly N isopropylacrylamide co N,N methylenebisacrylamide 90 10 To a l liter addition header was added 800 mt of distilled water, 180.0 g of N isopropylacrylamide and 20.0 g of N,N methylenebisacrylamide. The solution was bubbled with nitrogen for 10 minutes and 16 i of a 30 solution of Triton 77 surfactant the sodium salt of an alkylaryl polyether sulfate sold by Rohm and Haas Co. was added. To a 2 liter three necked flask was added 800 mQ of distilled water. The flask was placed in an 80 0C bath, stirred and the water bubbled with nitrogen for 10 minutes. To the flask was then added 16 8 of 30 Triton 77 , 2.00 g of potassium persulfate, 0.40 g of sodium metabisulfite followed immediately by the addition of the contents of the addition header over a period of 30 minutes.The resulting bluish white latex was stirred at 800C under nitrogen for an additional hour. The latex was then cooled to 400C and dialyzed against distilled water for 16 hours at 40 C. The latex was then cooled to 250C to give a colorless, translucent gel containing 9.4 solids.Example 2 Preparation of microgel composition comprising poly N isopropylacrylamide co 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate co N,N methylene bisacrylamide 70 20 10 To a l liter addition header was added 400 m of distilled water, 70.0 g of N isopropylacrylamide, 20.0 g of 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate, 10.0 g of N,N methylenebisacrylamide and 8 rnk of a 30 solution of Triton 770.. The solution was degassed with nitrogen and the header contents were added over a period of 30 minutes to a solution of l.OO g of potassium persulfate, 0.20 g of sodium metabisulfite and 8 mQ of a 30 solution ofTriton 770. in 400 mi of distilled water at 8000. The resulting latex was stirred at 8000 under nitrogen for 1 hour and then cooled to 4000 and dialyzed against distilled water at 4000 for 16 hours. The latex was then cooled to 2500 to give a hazy very viscous solution containing 10.3 solids.Example 3 Image Transfer Receiver Containing Microgel An image transfer receiver, activator solution and dye donor sheet were prepared to illustrate and compare the rate of dye migration through a receiver overcoat layer containing gelatin plus the microgel versus that of a gelatin overcoat only. The receiver consisted of the following structure 3. Overcoat layer Poly N isopropylacrylamide co 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate co N,N methylanebisacrylamide 75 15 10 weight ratio 8.1 g m2 , gelatin 2.7 g m2 Note The overcoat layer of the control consisted of 10.8 g m2 gelatin only.2.

The overcoat layer of the control gelatin only and example gelatin plus microgel were each coated by applying an aqueous solution of the solids from a coating hopper to the moving polyester sup port. The moving coated wet layer was first congealed at approximately 4.5 C 40 F and was then air dried at a series of increasing temperatures up to a final wet bulb temperature of 18.3 C 65 F at the dry point. An activator solution of the following composition was prepared potassium hydroxide 0.6N 5 methylbenzotriazole 3.0 g Q ll aminoundecanoic acid 2.0 g Q potassium bromide 2.0 g Q potassium sulfite 8.0 g t A dye donor cover sheet was prepared by coating the following overcoat on top of a neutralizing and timing layer equivalent to that described in Example 1 of U.S. Patent 4,353,973. A magenta azo dye having the structure EMI21.1 was coated on the sheet at 0.16 g m2 in 2.7 g i hydroxyethyl cellulose. The receiver was soaked in the activator contained in a hallow tray processor for 20 seconds at room temperature 29 C and then laminated to the dye donor cover sheet. The rate of dye diffusing to the mordant of the receiver was read as Status A reflection density as a function of time using aMacBeth densitometer. A comparison of the relative effectiveness of dye diffusion through the experiment overcoat gelatin plus microgel versus control overcoat gelatin only was made by comparing the rate constants for dye diffusion or by comparing the relative time required to attain an equal dye density. The following data indicate that when the microgel polymer is partially substituted for gelatin, iniproved diffusion of a photographic dye is obtained.
