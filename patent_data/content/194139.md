# ASSEMBLING SHEETS INTO A STACK

## Abstract
Apparatus for assembling sheets into a stack, the appara tus comprising a stacking station having two laterally spaced guide elements 25A, 25B defining first and second guide sur faces fixed relatively to one another. First and second transport systems 2, 3 9, 11, 12 define respective first and second paths, the first transport system being adapted to transport sheets along the first path to the stacking station 24 and the second transport system being adapted to transport sheets in both directions along the second path between positions up stream and downstream of the stacking station 24 . The guide elements 25A, 25B are movable between first and second po sitions 25 , 25 . In the first position sheets fed along the first and second paths from positions upstream of the stacking sta tion 24 are guided along respective ones of the first and second guide surfaces past the guide means to a position downstream of the stacking station in the second path. In the second position the guide elements 25A, 25B enable sheets in the second path to be moved between positions upstream and downstream of the stacking station 24 along the second path guided by the second surface and prevent sheets from passing into the first path. A microprocessor 31 controls operation of the first and second transport systems and the po sition of the guide elements 25A, 25B such that when the guide elements are in the first position, the speeds of the first and second transport systems are controlled whereby sheets fed along the first and second paths from upstream of the stacking station 24 are assembled together in a stack in the second path downstream of the stacking station.
