# Digital circuit extracting synchronism signals from a serial flow of coded data.

## Abstract
The digital circuit extracts synchronism signals from a serial flow of coded data according to a process which uses a phaselocked loop where the different level transitions of the signal received are separately considered and a phase is de termined for each type, the latter being compared with a spe cific reference phase, established in the initialization step. The error signal obtained from the comparison is used for correcting synchronism signal frequency.
