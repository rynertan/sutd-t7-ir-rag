# NOVEL LIQUID CRYSTAL COMPOUND AND LIQUID CRYSTAL COMPOSITION CONTAINING SAME

## Abstract
A novel pyridine derivative capable of increasing the die lectric anisotropy value Δε or optical anisotropy value Δn of the liquid crystal composition obtained by comprising the derivative and lowering the driving voltages of liquid crystal display elements having used the composition, and also a liquid crystal composition containing the pyridine derivative are provided, which pyridine derivative is expressed by the formula R X COO Y CH₂CH₂ Z A wherein R represents an alkyl group or an alkoxy group each of 1 10 carbon atoms X represents
