# Wind machine system with oscillating power transmission and improved counterbalancing.

## Abstract
A wind machine has a tower frame 12 formed by four converging beams. At the top of the tower is a gear head 26 connected to a wind driven rotatable multibladed rotor 48 . Connected to the gear head is a vertical shaft 27 which is reciprocated vertically as the rotor rotates. Bearings 22, 30 above and below the gear head enable the gear head to drive the shaft in both pushing and pull ing modes. The system includes a counterbalance assem bly 50 having tubular arms 52 at opposite sides of the vertical shaft. The arms are slidably carried by sleeves 60 pivoting in vertical planes on stationary pillow blocks 56 secured to the tower frame. Inner ends of the arms are con nected to the vertical shaft. Weights inside the arms are adjustably positioned on threaded rods, and both rods and weights can be locked in place for adjusting the counter balancing effect of the assembly with respect to the verti cal shaft and load.
