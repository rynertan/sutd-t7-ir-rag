# PROGRAMMABLE DATA SECURITY CIRCUIT FOR PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC DEVICE

## Abstract
An architecture security fuse circuit is disclosed for secur ing the architecture of a configurable programmable logic device. The storage element of the circuit is a floating gate tran sistor cell 124. Data stored in the cell is determined by the amount of charge trapped within the oxide isolated polysilicon floating gate region. The security fuse is initialized erased dur ing device fabrication to allow access to device architectural data. Such initialization is accomplished by a technique that the device user cannot duplicate, via an extra probe pad P21 acces sible only during wafer probe. To deter the effects of floating gate charge loss which may occur during subsequent fabrica tion steps, the fuse circuit is adapted to provide a reduced memory cell read voltage, thus providing greater margin against thermally defeating the security fuse. A regenrative feature is provided to strengthen the erased cell during every device clear cycle. Once the security fuse is programmed, the data defining the device architecture may not be interrogat ed or altered, and the memory cell 124 is unchanged by the regenerative feature.
