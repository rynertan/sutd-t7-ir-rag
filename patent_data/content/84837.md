# Flocculation of latex particles and production of thermoplastic resin.

## Abstract
A method for flocculating latex particles in a latex is characterized in that a water soluble cationic polymer con taining a quaternary ammonium salt in its molecular chain is added as a flocculant to the latex. Also disclosed is a process for producing a thermoplastic resin which com prises flocculating latex particles in a latex material by adding a water soluble cationic polymer containing a quaternary ammonium salt in its molecular chain to the latex, removing freed water from the flocculated latex to obtain a wet cake and then drying the wet cake directly or after the granulation.
