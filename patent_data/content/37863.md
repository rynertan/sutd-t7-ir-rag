## Description
DESCRIPTION PROCESS FOR MAKING MANGANOUS SULPHATE SOLUTION . This invention relates to a process of making manganous sulphate solution with low level impurity of potassium for manufacture of Electrolytic ManganeseDioxide. Electolytic Manganese Dioxide EMD is synth etically manufactured with naturally occurring manganese ore as the starting material. The most important property of END is its crystallographic structure. It has to be essentially gamma phase and the other crystal phase like alpha and beta have to be kept bare minimum.Alpha phase MnO2 is characterised by the presence of potassium in the crystal lattice and can be loosely described as K Mn8O16 Therefore, the potassium content of EMD should be as low as possible, preferably within 0.3 . The main source of potassium in END is the starting natural ore. In India, the chief deposits of MnO2 are of pyrolusite cryptomelane type and cryptomelane contains potassium in varying concentrations. The pure pyrolusite ore contains little or negligible potassium. But most of the MnO2 deposits in India, particularly in Central andEastern India, are of cryptomelane type and potassium content is of the order of 1 . Some ore deposits contain potassium up to 2 3 . Similar situation exists in many other countries. If this ore is used as a raw material for manufacture of EMD using conventional process, the intermediate MnSO4 solution will contain potassium impurity more then acceptable and Will ultimately give EMD contaminated wjth unacceptably higher alpha phase NnO2. Hence there is a need to develop a method which we have done and which forms the subject hereof for the production of EMD using high potassium MnO2 ores with the end product having essentially gamma phase Potassium less titan 0.3 . Since large proportion of available ores are of high potassium content, the method developed by us is of immense importance. Thy the method of this invention the potassium impurity of MnS04 solution obtained from manganese ores having potassium content more than 0.8 percent and for use in END manufacture can be substantially reduced or minimized. The prior art on the use of high potassium ore reveals two methods a Aqueous leach process In this process the ore is calcined with a reducing agent to Ma0. The chemical bond between potassium and manganese dioxide in the crystal lattice of cryptomelane is thus broken and potassium is converted to soluble carbonate or inactive complex silicates. Such a calcine is leached with hot water to remove soluble potassium and separated and further dissolution of calcine so treated in acid yields an electrolyte solution sufficiently low in potassium to give gamma phase END. b There is another method which uses powdered ferromanganese. Ferromanganese is added to the raw solution of MnO in y S04 or to spent electrolyte to produce a precipitate of ferric hydroxide at a pH of 6.0 to 6.5. Ferric hydroxide precipitate is claimed to occlude potassium and the filtered solution is said to contain low potassium. The method proposed herein uses ferric iron compound to remove potassium impurity from MnS04 solution during its preparation. It basically consists of digestion of partly neutralise . solution of NnS04 spent electrolyte liquor of END cells with soluble ferric ions at pH between 1 2 but preferably at 1.6 0.1 at temperature of 60 90 C higher temperature being more effective for a period between 1 4 hours. At the end of this period further nutralisation of free acid can be done usingMaO, CaO or like base as required to completely precipitate iron. Reduced manganese ore mono may be used advantageously. This method differs from the first method method italy referred to above in which intermediate stage digestion of partly neutralised ItaS04 solution as mentioned above at pH 1 2 is absent. The method invented by us is more effective in reducing potassium impurity as would be clear from the examples given later. The present process for reducing potassium content of MnS04 solution to be used for END manufacture prepared from manganese ore containing high potassium impurity has been arrived at by experimenting systematically on various factors like quantity of iron, pH, reaction time, temperature during preparation of MnS04 solution and their effect on potassium content of this solution. Accordingly this invention provides process of making manganous sulphate solution with low level impurity of potassium for manufacture of electrolytic manganese dioxide END from manganese ores containing high potassium impurity comprising adding reduced manganese ore MnO to spent electrolyte containing water soluble ferric ions till the pH of 1 to 2 is achieved, and digesting for a period of 1 to 4 hours maintaining the temperature of at least 60 to 90 C, thereafter again adding reduced manganese ore MnO till a pH of 4 6 is reached and separating the MnS04 solution obtained from the precipitated material. The preferred temperature for digestion at pH 1 2 is 900C and it should preferably be continued for at least 3 hours. Longer periods do not materially add to the improvement of the reaction process. The invention is described below with reference to a preferred manner of carrying out the process. STEP I A source of iron is added to spent electrolyte sxc, that ferric ion concentration in the above solution is between 0.2 to 6 gms per litre or more as required. Iron concentration required depends upon quantity of potassium to be removed . Metallic iron dissolved ill H2SO4 or FeSO4 itself can be used as source of iron and suitably oxidised to ferric state for the purpose, e.g. by MnO2, Mn2O3, O3 or H2O2 STEP 2 . Reduced manganese or MnO is added slowly to above solution of spent electrolyte containing ferric ions, kept agitated at temperature of 900 C. When pE of solution is 1.6 t 0.1, the addition of reduced ore is stopped. STEP 3. The whole mass is kept agitated at same temperature 90 C for a period of 3 hours. SUEP 4. Reduced ore MnO addition is started again slowly till pH of 4 6 is reached for complete precipitation of iron. STEP 5. The solution of MnS04 50 obtained which is low in potassium content is separated from the precipitate and other insoluble matter by e.g. filtration, decantation or centrifugation. Following examples illustrate effectiveness of herein proposed method as compared to the ferromanganese method referred to above in removal of potassium impurity from MnSO4 solution. Example o.l Manganese ore analysing Mn02 74 , Mn 51 , Fe 5.5 , silicious matter 5.4 , A1203 2.5 0.9 , Fa 1.2 , was reduced with fuel oil. Reduced ore contained about 3 MnO2, rest of manganese being present as MeG. This was used for making comparative study of MnS04 solution fresh electrolyte prepared from spent electrolyte containing Mn 30 mlitre, H2S04 45 mg litre and X 660 mg litre. Ferric sulfate was added to get 4 gm litre ferric ion concentration. Temperature was maintained throughout the reactions at 90 j 20 C. Rest of the processing method was similar to what is stated above. In another experiment a method similar to ferromanganese processing method referred to above was adopted.

Weighed FeSO4.7H2O crystals were added to the Spent Electrolyte so that iron concentration of 6 gpl was reached. This was further oxidised by add it ion of NnO2 ore. Fresh Electrolyte from above materials was prepared using two methods. Method No.1 was similar to Ferromanganese method method b referred to hereinabove in which reaction was carried out at 70 C.
