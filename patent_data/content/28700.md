# Method and apparatus for removing a semiconductor chip from a substrate.

## Abstract
A semiconductor chip 16a mounted on a substrate 10 by solder columns 18 connecting one side of the chip to the substrate is removed from the substrate by cooling the unconnected side of the chip by supplying liquid gas through a conduit 20 to embrittle the solder columns, and then twist ing the chip with small angle rotational motion to shear the columns at their midpoints. The cooling gas is confined within a shroud 22 which has a bottom opening 24 substantially conforming to the shape of the chip.
