# Elongated building structure.

## Abstract
An elongated building structure comprises a plurality of building elements 1,11 , some of which constitute end elements 1 . Said elements, which may be considered as being comprised in a building set, have a uniform thickness and generally a uniform, constant length 1 and a uniform constant height. To make possible construction of building structures which are elongated, i.e. have a greater extension than the elements proper, these are devised with specially designed connection ends 4 provided with notches 3 . The building elements are interconnected pairwise by means of special connection elements 5, 12 which extend in the transverse direction of the building elements and are also provided with notches 3 , into which portions of the connection ends of the building elements engage. These are in their turn engaged from the outside by those portions of the connection elements which are located on opposite sides of the notches of the connection elements. The building structure according to the invention can be erected without the utilization of screws, nails, bolts, nuts and the like and be made full size or constitute a toy model.

## Description
Peters, Bengt and Uhlmann, JackNorra Vägen 13 Norra Vägen 13S 302 31 HALMSTAD S 302 31 HALMSTADSweden Sweden ELONGATED BUILDING STRUCTURE Background of the Invention This invention relates to an elongated building structure of the kind generally defined in the preamble of claim 1. For the building structure in question a plurality of different, standardized, pre fabricated, unitary building elements are used which suitably are comprised in a building or construction set and of which at least the major portion have the same thickness cross dimension , the same height and in most instances also the same length.Examples of building structures which may be constructed of building elements comprised in the building set are floors, walls and ceilings as well as parts thereof. The building elements are in a manner known per se so designed, that the building structures in question, which may be made either in full size or may constitute toy models, can be erected by means of the building elements without the use of nails, screws, nuts and similar connection means. Many building structures of the kind in question known in the art, which are disclosed e.g. in the Swedish patent specifications 128 812 and 171 878 and the U.S.patent specification 2 874 512 have the drawback that they can not be made longer than the longest construction element comprised in the building structure in question. Building structures are also known which comprise structural elements which are interconnected in their longitudinal direction by means of transverse connection elements. An example hereof is disclosed in the British patent specification 941 100 which discloses building elements, whose ends have slots extending in the longitudinal direction of the elements. This has the consequence that of structural elements which are joined pairwise at their ends in their common longitudinal direction by means of the connecting elements none is locked in the longitudinal direction, but every pair of structural elements may be drawn out in said longitudinal direction without hindrance of the connection elements. Summarfi of the Invention The principal object of the invention is to eliminate the above drawbacks and to provide a building structure having a substantially arbitrary length, which may be many times greater than the length of the longest building element comprised in the building structure, said building elements being interlocked in their longitudinal direction as well as in the transverse direction. These objects are attained thanks to the features set forth in the characterizing clause of claim 1.

Description of the Preferred Embodiments Introductorily, it is to be observed that all figures are not drawn on exactly the same scale and do not either disclose all building elements, inclusive of end elements and connection elements, comprised in a building set It is also to be noted that each of the illustrated embodiments of building constructions are to be considered as part of a respective, bigger building construction. In addition hereto it is evident that the embodiments illustrated only are to be regarded as examples of building constructions which may be erected by the utilization of longitudinal connections according to the invention. All building elements, inclusive of the end elements illustrated in the Figures, have the same length extension in the longitudinal direction 1 see Figs. 2 and 3 , the same maximum height extension in the vertical direction h, and transverse dimension thickness t.The connection elements are plane parallel, like the building elements, and have the same height and thickness h and t, respectively, as the building elements but are substantially shorter than these. The width v of the notches or grooves is, with the exception of the elements according to Figs. 24 and 25, equal to or somewhat greater than the thickness of the elements. Apart from the elements according to Figs. 13, 26, 29 and 39 40, the grooves have an equal average deep d which amounts to about a fourth of the height of the respective elements. The distance a Fig. 3 from each element end to the groove located nearest to the end in question of respective elements is constant in the elements. In Figs. 1, 2 and 7 a joint or connection between two mutually similar end elements is shown which are generally designated with 1 and which overlap each other in the generally common longitudinal direction of the elements as well as in the vertical height direction perpendicular hereto. Such an element 1 is individually disclosed in Fig. 3. Each end element 1 has a termination end 2 which is located at one end of the building structure in which the element is comprised, and in which two grooves or notches 3 are provided, which are located substantially opposite each other and each of which opens into one of the longitudinal edges of its respective elements. The edges of the notches are mutually approximately parallel and are, like the grooves, substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal edges of the elements. As mentioned above, the grooves or notches 3 have a width v measured between the edges and a deep d 1 4 h and are located at the distance a from the end of the element 1, when measured between said end and the nearest edge of the notch 3. The other end of the element 1 is a joining or connection end 4 which overlaps, andisoverlapped, respectively, by a similar connection end 4 of an adjoining or adjacent building element, which is an end element inFigs. 1 2 but which, of course, also could be a building element 11 according to Fig. 6. With the latter definition introduced above, the connection end 4 has the height h 2 and the length 2a v and may be considered to have been formed by the removal of a rectangle having said dimensions from the upper right hand corner of the element 1 in Fig. 3. In the middle of the edge extending along the longitudinal central line of the connection element, the connection end has a similar notch or groove 3. The two elements 1 of Figs. 1 and 2 are interconnected by means of a connection element or locking member which is illustrated in Fig. 4 and generally designated with 5. The connection element 5 has a length of 2a v and a height of h and comprises a pair of mutually opposite notches 3 which are located in the middle of a respective one of the two longitudinal edges of the connection member. The connection member accordingly consists of two shanks 7 and an interconnecting bridge or web 8, which means that it substantially has the shape of the letter H.The bridge 8 of the connection member penetrates into, or engages, the closed rectangular aperture which is created by the supplementing grooves 3 of the respective connection ends 4, and the shanks 7 of the connection member enclose the two connection ends while engaging their lateral surfaces, whereby the elements 1 are substantially rigidly interconnected with each other in a registering position, as is apparent from Fig. 7. To stabilize the building structure according toFigs. 1 2 it may be provided, at one of its ends as shown or at both ends with such a support element 10 as is illustrated in Fig. 5 and in principle constitutes one half of the connection element 5 according to Fig. 4, said half being located at one side of a horizontal centre line.The cooperation of the support elements 10 with the end elements 1 is apparent from Fig. 8. Between the two end elements 1 of Figs. 1 and 2 there may be introduced into the building structure according to the invention, one or several building elements of the kind disclosed in Fig. 6, in which they are generally designated 11. These building elements are at their ends provided with such connection ends as are illustrated in the right hand portion of Fig. 3 and fit together with the connection ends of the other building elements, inclusive of the end elements. In Figs. 9 12 there are illustrated two levels of another building structure according to the invention which comprises building elements and end elements 11 and 1, respectively, of the same kind as in the embodiment according to Figs. 1 2. In the building construction according to Figs. 9 12 there are, however, in addition to the connection elements 5 according to Fig. 4 and the support element 10 according to Fig. 5, other connection elements, which are illustrated individually in Fig. 13 and are designated with 12. The connection element according to Fig. 13 has a single groove 9, whose depth 2 d is twice of that of the grooves 3 and opens centrally into one of the longitudinal edges of the element 12.The connection element 12 does not lock building elements located within the same level mutually in the lateral direction but instead hereof makes possible addition or connection of further levels, adjoining each other in the vertical direction while being mutually interlocked laterally by means of the connection element 12, as is apparent fromFig. 11 which is a cross sectional view on line XI XI inFig. 9. Fig. 12 illustrates in the same way the support and connection elements 10 and 5, respectively, at the ends of the building structure according to Figs. 9 and 10.Laterally interlocking as well as expansion in the vertical direction can be made possible by means of such H shape connection elements as are illustrated in Fig. 40. Figs. 14, 15 and 16 are each a side view of a modification 4a, 4b and 4c, respectively, of the connection end of an end or building element 1 and 11, respectively. In Figs. 17 22 there are illustrated two levels of a modified building structure constructed according to the invention and in which adjoining building elements overlap each other in the longitudinal direction as well as in the transverse direction. The building structure according to Figs. 17 22 comprises building elements 13 according to Fig. 23, connection elements 14 according to Fig. 24 and support elements 15 according to Fig. 25 as well as connection elements 5 according to Fig. 4. The latter elements 5 are here utilized for stabilizing purpose at the two ends of the building structure to fill up a gap which would otherwise occur. At their two termination or connection ends the building element 13 has the same design as the termination end 2 of the end element 1. The connection elements 14 according to Fig. 24 are H shaped like the connection elements 5 and have grooves or notches 16, which are substantially twice as wide as the notches 3, i.e. approximately equal to 2 y. On account hereof the connection elements 14 will get a length of 2a 2v . Basically, the support elements 15 corresponds to the support element 10 of Fig. 5 but has a groove 16 which is twice as wide as that of Fig. 5 and may be considered to constitute one half of the connection element 1 according to Fig. 24, which is located on one side of a central line which is parallel to the longitudinal edges of the element. As most clearly is evident from Figs. 19 and 20 which are simplified, horizontal sectional views through the upper level and the lower level, respectively, of Fig.17, the connection ends of the elements 13 overlap each other. The lateral surfaces of each element,which face the other elements, substantially contacts or engages the respective other elements due to the fact that the width 2 v of the notches 16 is only insignificantly greater than the total thickness 2 t of the ends 4. This width has been substantially exaggerated in Figs. 19 and 20 to make theFigures clearer.Apart from those locations, where the ends of the building elements 13 overlap each other or an element 5, the building structure according to Figs. 17 22 comprises only one single layer, every second element 13 in the horizontal as well as in the vertical direction, however, being located in another vertical plane than the remaining elements 13 which in their turn are located in a common plane which is parallel to and located immediately adjacent the first mentioned vertical plane. End to end overlapping is also present in the embodiment according to Fig. 26, which illustrates a cross sectional view through the two opposite ends of a pair of adjacent building elements 13 which are located on different levels. These ends engage each other in the joining or overlapping area. The cross sectional view according toFig. 26 also illustrates a connection element 18 which interconnects the building elements and is illustrated in plan view in Fig. 27. This connection element 18 is also substantiallyH shaped and has grooves 19, which have the same width as the notches 3 but a greater depth than the notches 3 and 16 and whose mutually parallel edges form an angle with the two longitudinal edges of the connection element which deviates from 900. Each notch or groove 19 has an edge which is located substantially in the same plane as one of the edges of the opposite groove. Provided that the connection elements 18 are mounted with their height direction vertical, the planes of the building elements will form an acute angle with the vertical plane, as is evident from Fig. 25. The embodimentdiagrammatically indicated in Fig. 18 does not provide a tight wall or panel but one, in which building elements 13 alternate with openings which are located beside as well as above and below the elements 13 in a chessboard pattern. The connection element 18 may also be utilized for the mounting of scale panels or the like. Fig. 28 is a plan view illustrating a support element 20 which constitutes one half of the connection element 18 and is intended for the embodiment according toFig. 26. In Fig. 29 there is illustrated a modified building element 22 which may be utilized in the embodiment according to Fig. 26 instead of the element 13. The building structure illustrated in Figs. 30 36 basically corresponds to the one disclosed in Figs. 17 22 apart from the fact that adjacent building elements are arranged with an interspace in the transverse direction at their connection ends instead of engaging each other there.These interspaces have been created by replacing the notches 16 having the width 2 v of the connection element 14 according to Fig. 24 with two distant notches 3 having the width v in the connection element 24 according to Fig.37, which is utilized in the embodiment according to Fig.30 36, in which also the support element 25 according toFig. 38 as well as connection elements 5 according to Fig.4, which are utilized as filling, are comprised. As is evident from Fig. 37, the connection element 24 has the shape of a double comb having three pairs of teeth, and it may also be regarded as two H s joined togheter and having a common central shank. The support element 25 illustrated in Fig. 38 constitutes one half of the connection element 24 according to Fig. 37, said half being defined by the axis of symmetry of element 24. When comparing the building structures according to Figs. 17 22 on one hand with those according to Figs.30 36 on the other hand it is evident that said structures are substantially similar and that the most essential difference resides therein that the first structure is denser than the last mentioned one. In fig. 39 there is illustrated an embodiment 26 which constitutes a variant of the connection member 24 according to Fig. 37 modified in accordance with Fig. 27. As is evident from the above an almost unlimited number of different building structures can be constructed of the different elements according to the invention. It is therefor obvious that the embodiments described above and illustrated in the drawings are to be regarded merely as non limiting examples which may be modified with respect to their individual features and dimensions within the scope of the following claims. In particular, new embodiments which are also encompassed by the inventive concept, may be created by combining details which are taken from different ones of the exemplificatory embodiments described above. In particular connecting members according to both Fig. 13 and Fig. 40 may be utilized in combination with building elements according to Fig. 3 and or 6 in the same building structure.
