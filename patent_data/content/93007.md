# METHOD OF TREATING THE SURFACE OF POLYMERIC MATERIAL

## Abstract
A process for treating certain polymeric materials such as polypropylene and polystyrene incorporating structural units each containing at least one tertiary carbon atom to improve certain surface characteristics comprises forming in the vicinity of the surface of the material a dense concentra tion of hydroxyl groups, substantially all the hydroxyl groups being attached to tertiary carbon atoms without the forma tion of appreciable quantities of aldehydes, peroxides, ketones or epoxides and without appreciable C C chain scission. The treated material exhibits high qualities in many directions including those of high wettability, cell adherence, permeability and dye take up.
