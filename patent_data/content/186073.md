# Driver circuit.

## Abstract
A driver circuit for applying a first signal having a desired wave form, frequency and peak to peak voltage to a coaxial transmission line which also has applied to it a second signal having a substantially higher frequency in cludes an operational amplifier 26 having the first signal applied to its noninverting input 24 . The output 28 of the operational amplifier is applied across the primary winding 34 of a driver coupling transformer 36 through an inductor 30 which provides high impedance to the second signal. The voltages induced in the secondary winding 38 of the driver transformer are applied to the transmission line 40 . The primary winding 46 of a feedback transformer 48 is connected in parallel with the secondary winding 38 of the driver transformer. The voltage induced in the secondary winding of the feedback transformer 48 is applied by a feedback circuit 52, 54 including an R.C. filter 56, 58 to the inverting input 44 of the operational amplifier 26 . The signal applied to the inverting input terminal includes both an A.C. component and a D.C. component, which compo nents cause the output current of the operational amplifier to induce in the secondary winding of the driver transformer a signal, the wave form, frequency and peak to peak voltage of which substantially equal those of the first signal applied to the noninverting input 24 of the operational amplifier.
