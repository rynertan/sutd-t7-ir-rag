## Description
Apparatus for determining the course angle of a vessel or vehicle. The invention relates to an apparatus for determining the course angle of a vessel or vehicle with respect to the magnetic meridian at the location of the vessel or vehicle. A known apparatus of this type is a cardan suspended magnetic compass. The operation of such a magnetic compass is based on the principle that a compass needle will be directed in accordance with the horizontal component of the magnetic field at the location of the compass.However, the magnetic compass has the disadvantage that in stead of the direction of the horizontal component of the earth magnetic field, the direction of the horizontal component of the over all magnetic field at the location of the compass is indicated. In a vessel or vehicle this magnetic field is strongly affected by the presence of ferro magnetic construction material of the vessel or vehicle. Therefore, comprehensive and cumbrous provisions should be made to eliminate interferences of the earth magnetic field in order to guarantee that the compass indicates the direction of the nagnetic meridian at the location of the compass. The invention aimes to provide an apparatus of the above mentioned kind, wherein this disadvantage is obviated in a simple but nevertheless effective manner. To this end, the apparatus according to the invention is characterized by a first and a second probe which are mounted at least rotationally fixed in the vessel or vehicle in measuring directions mutually enclosing an angle, said probes each providing an output signal dependent on a change of the magnetic flux in the respective probes as caused by a change of the course angle of the vessel or vehicle, wherein both said probes are coupled with a processor unit which derives the course angle of the vessel or vehicle from said output signals. According to a first embodiment both said probes are made as a flat wire coil mounted completely fixed in the vessel or vehicle, said wire coils each having a great number of windings with a diameter in the order of magnitude of 1 m. Thereby, it is obtained that, at movements of the vessel or vehicle, the flux enclosed by the probes due to the magnetic field of the vessel or vehicle, does not change so that the output signals of the probes are only dependent on the movement of the vessel or vehicle with respect to the earth magnetic field. According to the invention a compensating device can be provided for compensating the output signals of both said probes as caused by the vertical component of the earth magnetic field at the location of the vessel or vehicle, which compensating device according to the invention comprises a third and a fourth probe which are mounted completely fixed in the vessel or vehicle and the measuring directions of which extend parallel to the measuring directions of the first and the second probe, respectively, and a magnet, the magnetic field of which is opposite to the vertical component of the earth magnetic field, wherein the sensitivity of the third and fourth probes is a small fraction of the sensitivity of the first and second probes, while the strength of said magnet is much greater than the strength of the vertical component of the earth magnetic field, wherein the output signals of the third and the fourth probe are added to the output signals of the first and the second probe, respectively. According to an alternative embodiment of the invention both said probes each consist of at least two coils connected in series and disposed diametrically opposite of each other on an annular core of a magnetic material with high permeability. In this manner it is obtained that the magnetic flux enclosed by the probes is substantially increased so that the diameter of the windings of the respective coils can be chosen much smaller. According to a favourable embodiment the annular core is in this case mounted in the vessel or vehicle by means of a cardan suspension, wherein preferably a magnet is disposed in the centre of the annular core, and the magnetic field of said magnet is directed oppositely to the vertical component of the magnetic field of the vessel or vehicle and corresponds in magnitude to the magnitude of said vertical component. The invention will hereinafter be further explained by reference to the drawings, in which some embodiments of the apparatus according to the invention are shown.

Fig. 4 shows an electric circuit of the apparatus used at the vessel of fig. 1, to which the compensating device of fig. 3 is added. Figs. 5a 5d schematically show an alternative embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention, wherein the probes are disposed on an annular core. Fig. 6a is a schematically shown cross section of a practical embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention, wherein the probes are disposed on an annular core. Fig. 6b schematically shows a top view of the apparatus according to fig. 6a. Fig. 7 shows an electric circuit of an embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention In the embodiment of the apparatus according to fig. 1, a first probe and a second probe are formed by an air coil 1 with a main axis 4 parallel to the longitudinal direction of a vessel 3, and by an air coil 2 with a main axis 5 parallel to the transverse direction of the vessel 3, respectively. Both probes 1, 2 are immovably disposed with respect to the vessel 3. The course angle ec to be measured is the angle measured in the horizontal plane between the magnetic meridian 6 and the longitudinal direction 4 of the vessel 3. The vessel 3 is usually subject to roll movements and pitch movements. The roll angle er is the angle measured in a vertical plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction 4 of the vessel and amounts to 0 when the vessel lies straight. The pitch angle ep is the angle measured in a vertical plane perpendicular to the transverse direction 5 of the vessel 3 and amounts to 0 when the vessel lies straight. The earth magnetic field prevailing at the location of the vessel 3 has the horizontal component h and the vertical component v. W1 and W2 are the products of the surface area and the number of windings of the probes 1 and 2, respectively. For the flux enclosed by the respective probes 1 and 2 due to the earth magnetic field, the following equations apply 1 W1 h cos ec cos ep W1 v sin ep 1 2 W2 h sin ec cos er 2 v sin er 2 In practice ep 5 and er 4 150 normally applies, so that it may be assumed that cos e 1 and sin ee. In this case, the equations 1 and 2 can be written as follows 1 W1 h cos ec W1 v ep 1 2 W2 h sin ec W2 v er 2 Due to changes of the course and to variations of the roll angle er and of the pitch angle ep as caused by the symmetrically with respect to the vertical rolling and pitching of the vessel, variations occur in the flux components 1 and 2 whereby an electromotive force is generated in the coils 1 and 2. The two probes 1, 2 also enclose a magnetic flux caused by the remanent magnetism in the iron construction parts of the vessel.However, at changes of course, at roll movements and at pitch movements of the vessel, the flux enclosed by the probes as caused by this remanent magnetism does not change, because the probes 1, 2 do not move with respect to the magnetized construction parts. Therefore, the electromotive force generated in the probes 1, 2 is representing the movement of the vessel with respect to the earth magnetic field, and provisions for eliminating the remanent magnetism at the location of the probes 1, 2 are superfluous. For the electromotive force generated in the coils 1 and 2 at a movement of the vessel, the following equations apply e1 d1 dt W1 h sin ec d etc dot W1 1v dt 3 p e2 d02 dt W2 h cos ec d 8 dot W2v der dt 4 The voltages e1 and e2 can be apprehended as quasi direct current voltages in view of the inertia of the vessel movements. As shown in fig. 2, the probes 1, 2 are connected to differential amplifiers 15, 16 through filters 20, 21, which amplifiers amplify the generated output signals of the probes to the desired signal level. Interferences of a relatively high frequency and voltages generated by vibrations of the construction parts onto which the probes 1, 2 are mounted, are eliminated in the filters 20 and 21.The differential amplifiers 15 and 16 provide the amplified signal to an analog digital converter 17, 18 respectively. With respect to the necessary amplification, sensitivity and stability it is noted that at a horizontal angular velocity of one arc degree sec, the electromotive force generated in one winding with a surface of 1 m2 amounts to 0,33 eV at the strength of the horizontal component of the earth magnetic field prevailing in theNetherlands. A round coil with 5000 windings having a diameter of 80 cm and a wire thickness of 0,08 mm, provides a maximum signal of at least 40 t V at an angular velocity of 0,05 arc degree sec the sensitivity limit of the common curve velocity indicators . The internal resistance of this coil amounts to 88 kA, the weight of the coil is 1,13 kg and the cross section of the over all winding amounts to 0,5 cm2. The reaction sensitivity and the stability of the combinations 15 17 and 16 18 of amplifier and analog digital converter should be between 1 and 10 T V. By sampling the generated electromotive force e1 and e2 at regular intervals, by digitizing the obtained samples and by adding the digitized results in a processor unit 19 for example a micro computer , two informations are obtained which applyto the following equations, respectively EMI6.1 By setting the initial values for W1 h cos ec and W2 h sin ec, respectively, so as to be in accordance with the momentarily valid course angle at the beginning of an integration period t 0 , while the vessel lies straight ep and er 0 oratleast p and er are known, the constants C1 up to C4 in the equations 5 and 6 become equal to zero.For entering said data, the apparatus according to fig. 2 is provided with a keyboardw14. Because it is assumed that the rolling and pitching of the vessel is symmetrically with respect to the vertical, the result of the integration for the roll angle r and the pitch angle is also equal to zero, so that finally p the following equations apply at the point of tim t t1 EMI6.2 which gives EMI6.3 From 7 and 8 the course angle ec can be derived and this course angle can be indicated on a display device 22. If the angular velocity of the rolling and or pitching of the vessel is low, the terms containing this angular velocity in the equations 3 and 4 can be neglected. In this case, the equations 3 and 4 read as follows 1 W1 h sin ec dex dot g e2 W2 h cos ec dub dot 10 c 11 e1 e2 W1 W2 tan e The ratio W1 W2 is known, so that the momentary value of the course angle ec can be derived.After comparing with the course angle obtained by the integration, the value of the course angle calculated with 11 can be used for the correction of the course angle obtained by the integration, which correction may, for example, be necessitated by drift of the amplifiers or by accumulation of interference signals. If desired, the signals e1 and e2 can also be used to determine a signal corresponding with the velocity of the change of the course angle. To this end, the signals e1 and e2 should be added up after squaring, whereafter the square root of the sum is determined, which valueEMI7.1 corresponds to the magnitude of the velocity.Such an operation can be done by the processor unit 19. At roll and pitch periods of short duration for example a duration of 1 up to 5 sec the sinus shaped interference of the course angle signal caused by the periodical movements can be eliminated by the repetitive measurement of the course angle according to equation 11 within the time duration determined by a plurality of roll and pitch periods, respectively, so that a correct determination of the course angle will be obtained. At a great value of the amplitude of the rolling and pitching and at a long period thereof, the inductionvoltage thus generated and provided by the probes 1 and 2 cannot be neglected anymore, so that these inter fering voltages should be eliminated. This can be done by converting the roll movements with respect to the vertical into electrical voltages by means of an artificially generated vertical magnetic field, which voltages are used as a compensation for the interfering inductionvoltages in the probes 1 and 2. To this end, a compensating device is provided which uses a second set of probes, which probes are mainly affected by the artificial vertical field. The respective output voltages of said second set of probes are used for compensating the electromotive forces generated in the probes 1 and 2 by the rolling and or pitching. In fig.3 said second set of probes consisting of coils 7 and 8, is shown as disposed around a magnet 9 providing the artificial vertical field. Fig. 4 shows a circuit in which the output signals of the probes 7 and 8 are combined with those of the probes 1 and 2, respectively. The probe 7 is immovably disposed with respect to the vessel 3 ship fixed in a plane parallel to the coil 1. At a diameter which, for example, amounts to 10 of the diameter of the coil 1, the electromotive force generated in coil 7 as caused by movements with respect to the local magnetic field is only 1 of the electromotive force in the coil 1. The probe 8 is immovably disposed in a plane parallel to the coil 2. The coils 7 and 8 are mainly affected by the permanent magnet 9 which is cardan suspended in their centre by means of bearings 10 and 11. Because the magnet 9 is part of a freely movable pendulum which may be viscousely damped or not, the position of the magnet 9 is normally in the vertical. The filters 20 and 21 shown in the circuit of fig. 4 also eliminate the interfering voltages generated by the coils 7 and 8 as caused by vibrations and by self vibrations of the magnetic pendulum 9 10 11 with a high vibration rate.After voltage division in adjusting resistances 12 and 13 which are adjusted by means of a scale calibrated in the vertical intensity of the earth magnetic field to be compensated, the following values for the electromotive force are obtained e3 W7 m dt 12 p e4 W8 m d r dt 13 wherein W7 and W8 are the product of surface area and number of windings for the coils 7 and 8, respectively, and wherein m is the field strength of the magnet 9.This field strength m should be higher than the vertical component of the earth magnetic field. By adding, the following equations are obtained e5 1 e1 e3 W1h sin ec dec dt W1v de dt W7 m d dt 14 e6 e2 e4 W2 h cos ec dec dt W2 v d r dt W8 m d8r dt 15 By adjusting the resistances 12 and 13 in a suitable manner, the second and third terms of the equations 14 and 15 eliminate each other so that the equations 9 , 10 and 11 are obtained as a result, from which the course angle ec can be derived. Fig. 5a shows the principle of an embodiment, wherein the crosswise placed probes 1 and 2 are disposed on a common annular core 30 of magnetic material with a high permeability for example mu metal . Thereby, a concentration of the earth magnetic field 6 will occur, because a great part of the lines of force will extend through parts of the ring 30 lying in their path. This causes a substantial increase of the signal strength at rotation of the probes 1 and 2 in the magnetic field of the earth, while the measuring accuracy is maintained at a sufficient rotation symmetry of the ring 30. As appears from fig. 5b, the shape of the coil 1 in side view and 2 not shown can be adapted to the ring 30 as the magnetic lines of force now extend through the ring 30 and the surface outside of the ring 30 does not contribute to the magnitude of the induction signal.At rotation in the horizontal plane, the horizontal parts 39 of each winding do not contribute to the electromotive force at the terminals of the coil 1, while the vertical parts 40 generate voltages which add to the output of coil 1 because of their opposite movements with respect to the magnetic lines of force. If the horizontal parts 39 of each winding are substituted by vertical parts 37 and 38, nothing is changed for the voltage at the terminals of the coil 1, because the parts 37 and 38 lie within the field free space 36 within the mu metal ring 30. Thereby, the probe 1 can be assembled of two diametrically disposed wire coils 31 and 32 wound around the ring 30, as shown in fig.5c, wherein the function of the probe 1 is maintained.Fig. 5d shows a top view, wherein the probe 2 is also assembled of coils 33 and 34 diametrically disposed on the ring 30 in an identical manner. The substitution of the air coils with a great diameter for coils with a small diameter wound around a mu metal annular core has the advantage that for the same signal amplitude a significant decrease of the resistance of the coils is obtained, which favourably influences the stability of the signal at amplification thereof. A further coil 35 is disposed on the ring 30, which coil is connected to an ac source. Thereby, an alternating flux is generated in the ring 30, which flux eliminates the magnetic hysteresis occuring in the ring 30 at a rotation in the horizontal plane. As the coil pairs 31 32 and 33 34 are oppositely connected for a magnetic flux circulating in the ring 30, the alternating flux does not cause interfering signals at the inputs of the measuring system for the course determination. In the embodiment of fig. 5d the compensating device of fig. 3 can be used, if desired. Figs. 6a and 6b show an embodiment of the apparatus, wherein the probes according to fig. 5 are used.The ring 30, to which the coils 31 34 are disposed, is supported on a ring 41 with a L shaped cross section , which ring 41 is cardan suspended to a support 45 by means of an intermediate ring 42 and cardan axes 43 and 44, wherein the support 45 is fixed to the vessel 3. Two magnets 46 and 47 are mounted in the centre of the ring 30, which magnets have such a polarisation and field strength that they eliminate the vertical component of the magnetic field of the vessel 3 at the location of the ring 30.The magnets 46, 47 can be made as a permanent magnet or as an electro magnet. By means of the magnets 46 47 it is obtained that the vertical component of the magnetic field of the vessel 3 does not generate induction voltages in the coils 31 34 at rolling and pitching of the vessel 3. Because the ring 30 with the coils 31 34 is rotationally fixed to the vessel 3, the horizontal component of the magnetic field of the vessel 3 causes no inductionvoltages in the coils 31 34 at a change of course angle, as the ring 30 with the coils 31 34 and the vessel 3 make the same movement in the horizontal plane. Therefore, the coils 31 34 provide only induction voltages dependent on the horizontal component of the earth magnetic field at the location of the vessel 3 at a change of course of the vessel 3. Without the application of the magnets 46, 47 the vertical component of the magnetic field of the vessel 3 could cause an interfering signal in the coils 31 34 due to the often long roll periods of the vessel, which interfering signals have a low frequency in the range of the frequencies occuring at a change of course angle. Therefore, these interfering signals cannot be suppressed by means of an electrical filter. The interfering signals generated by the own oscillating movements of the ring 30 with the coils 31 34 in the cardan suspension 42 45, have a high frequency so that these signals can be suppressed by an electrical filter without significantly affecting the signals generated by a change of course angle. The cardan suspended ring 30 can be closed off by means of a cap 48 fixed to the vessel 3. Fig. 7 shows an electric circuit which can be used at the embodiment of the probes according to fig. 6, wherein the generated induction signals are integrated in an analog manner. The circuit is only shown for the probe 31, 32 for the longitudinal direction as the embodiment for the probe 33, 34 is equal therewith. The induction signal e1 generated in the coils 31, 32 as caused by the changes of flux in the ring 30, is applied to an operational amplifier 50 through a filter 49, which amplifier 50 is connected as an integrator by means of a feed back capacitor 51. The filter 49 is provided for suppression of incidental voltage peaks in order to prevent current saturation in the amplifier 50. The outpit of the integrator 50, 51 provides a signal corresponding to .veldt, wherein an interfering signal can be present caused by the oscillating movements of the cardan suspension of the ring 30. This interfering signal is suppressed by means of the filter 52. The output of the filter 52 is connected to the analog digital converter 17, which is connected to thS processor unit 19. The processor unit 19 detértines the desired course angle from the provided signals,according to the equations 7 and 8 . The course angle is indicated on the display device 22. An oscillator 53 provides an ac voltage which is supplied to the coil 35 through a filter 54. Thereby, the alternating flux is generated in the ring 30 as described to eliminate the magnetic hysteresis occuring therein at a rotation in the horizontal plane. The invention is not restricted to the abovedescribed embodiments which can be varied in a number of ways within the scope of the invention.
