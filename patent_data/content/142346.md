# Method and apparatus for filling vessels.

## Abstract
In order to fill a pressure vessel 9 with a precisely known quantity of liquid organic compound and with a quantity of propellant, use is made of the pressure in a storage vessel not shown of the propellant to transfer both the quantity of the organic compound and propellant to the pressure vessel 9 without the aid of a mechanical pump employing moving parts such as rotors. A known volume defined between valves 2 and 3 is filled under gravity with the organic liquid from a reservoir 7. Valves 1, 4 and 5 are operated so as to cause propellant typically liquid to flow under its vapour pressure from the storage vessel and to cause the quantity of liquid organic compound to enter the vessel 9. Propellant also enters the vessel 9 and flow continues until a pressure balance is reached. The vessel 9 may then be used to spray the organic liquid over the environment.
