# Method apparatus for sensing sheet like elements.

## Abstract
Labels 29 are carried on a label strip 31. To detect gaps 33 between the labels a label applicator is equipped with an optical sensing device consisting of a source 47 and a detector 53. A barrier 55 minimizes the passage of light to the detector 53 while a label 29 is passing but when a gap 33 is aligned wih 47 and 53 an optical signal is obtained which can be used to control the applicator. If labels 29 are transparent the light is directed at a small angle to the surface such that light entering the label is trapped by total internal reflection and does not reach detector 53. The barrier 55 is resiliently pressed against the label strip but supported by a film of air under pressure.
