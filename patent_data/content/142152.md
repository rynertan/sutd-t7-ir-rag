## Description
In recent years there has been a great deal of effort directed to the development of sulfonamides having herbicidal activity and several of these compounds have reached the stage of commercialization, i.e., chlorosulfuron and sulfometuron methyl. These compounds exhibit both preemergence and postemergence activity against undesirable vegetation and, in addition, have a low toxicity to mammals. The compounds of the prior art may be depicted as follows In addition, there are a number of other sulfonamide herbicides that have been commercialized, for example, methyl sulfanilylcarbamate O,O diisopropyl phosphorodithioate S ester with N 2 mercaptoethyl benzenesulfonamide 3 isopropyl 1H 2,1,3 benzothiadiazin 4 3H one 2,2 dioxide N 2,4 dimethyl 5 trifluoromethyl sulfonyl amino phenyl acetamide 3,5 dinitro N⁴,N⁴ dipropylsulfanilamide and 2 t butyl 4 2,4 dichloro 5 isopropoxyphenyl Δ² 1,3,4 oxadiazolin 5 one. We have now found that compounds having the formula In addition certain derivatives of compounds of general formula I also exhibit herbicidal activity and suppression of nitrification of ammonium nitrogen in soil and are effective in beneficially regulating the growth of crops and have the general formulas The aromatic or heteroaromatic ring systems include, for example, phenyl 1 or 2 napthyl 2 , 3 or 4 pyridyl 2 or 3 thienyl 2 or 3 furyl 2 , 4 or 5 thiazolyl 2 , 4 or 5 imidazolyl 2 , 4 or 5 oxazolyl 3 , 4 or 5 isothiazolyl 3 , 4 or 5 isoxazolyl 3 , 4 or 5 pyrazolyl 2 benzthiazolyl 2 benzoxazolyl 2 benzimidiazolyl and 1 benztriazolyl. Typical examples of substituents found on the aromatic or heteroaromatic ring systems may be one, more than one, or a combination of the following halo F, Cl, Br, I , alkyl, haloalkyl, aryl, hydroxy, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, aryloxy, substituted aryloxy, heteroaryloxy, substituted heteroaryloxy, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, nitro, alkylthio, haloalkylthio, alkylsulfinyl, haloalkylsulfinyl, alkylsulfonyl, haloalkylsulfonyl, substituted or unsubstituted arylthio, substituted or unsubstituted arylsulfinyl, substituted or unsubstituted arylsulfonyl, cyano, carboxylic acids and derivatives of carboxylic acids such as esters derived from readily available alcohols and amides derived from ammonia or readily available primary and secondary amines , sulfonic acids and derivatives of sulfonic acids such as sulfonates derived from readily available alcohols and sulfonamides derived from ammonia or readily available primary or secondary amines , formyl, alkylcarbonyl, haloalkylcarbonyl, arylcarbonyl, substituted arylcarbonyl, oximino, oxime ethers, carbinols and carbinol derivatives such as ethers and esters derived from readily available alkylating agents and carboxylic acids respectively and mercaptoalkyl and derivatives of mercaptoalkyl groups such as thioethers and thioesters derived from readily available alkylating agents and carboxylic acids respectively . The substituents on the triazolopyrimidine fragment of structure I are represented by X, Y and Z. Substituents X, Y and Z may be H, alkyl, haloalkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, aryl, substituted aryl, halo F, Cl, Br, I , alkylthio, arylthio, amino including alkyl or aryl substituted amino , carboxylic acids and esters. In addition, two adjacent substituents i.e., X and Y or Y and Z may be joined together in a cyclic structure. Examples of such cyclic structures could be represented by X, Y or Y, Z equal to CH₂ Preferred compounds of the invention have the general formula Preferred compounds of the invention also have the general formula Most preferred compounds of the invention have the general formula Specifically preferred compounds of the invention include In addition the following compounds are preferred due to their high levels of herbicidal activity and selectivity to crop species In addition certain derivatives of compounds corresponding to I also exhibit herbicidal activity and nitrification inhibition activity in soil. For example, compounds having the formula Preferred derivatives of this embodiment of the invention have the general formula Most preferred derivatives of this embodiment of the invention have the general formula Specifically preferred derivatives of this embodiment of the invention include Another series of derivatives of compounds of type I also possess herbicidal activity. These compounds are represented by the general formula Preferred derivatives of this embodiment of the invention have the general formula Most preferred derivatives of this embodiment of the invention have the general formula Specifically preferred derivatives of this embodiment of the invention include Furthermore, in the above invention corresponding to general formula III the existence of stereoisomerism is possible. For example stereoiosmeric relationships exist when at least one of substituents X, Y and Z does not equal hydrogen. When only one of substituents X, Y and Z does not equal hydrogen the compound of type III may exist as a mixture of enantiomers. One enantiomer will be designated as having the R configuration and the other will be designated as having the S configuration. Each enantiomer may exhibit different levels of herbicidal activity. When two or more of substituents X, Y or Z in structure III do not equal hydrogen, the material may exist as a mixture of diastereomers. For example when two substituents among X, Y and Z do not equal hydrogen, the compound may exist as two diastereomers. When all three of substituents X, y and Z do not equal hydrogen the compound may exist as four diastereomers. In addition all of the diastereomers described above exist as a mixture of two enantiomers. All of the stereoisomers described above, diastereomers and their enantiomeric pairs, may exhibit different levels of herbicidal activity. The synthesis of compounds of general structure I can be carried out in a straightforward manner as illustrated in Scheme I. Reaction of sulfonyl chloride IV with the appropriate aromatic substituted or unsubstituted or heteroaromatic substituted or unsubstituted amino compound ArNH₂ under basic conditions yields the desired product I. A wide range of solvents may be employed i.e., CH₂Cl₂, CH₃CN or pyridine at temperatures ranging from 0 C to reflux. Bases which serve as catalysts include pyridine, 4 dimethylaminopyridine and tertiary alkylamines such as triethylamine or N methylmorpholine. Generally the amino compound serves as the limiting reagent. Molar ratios of between 1.1 and 1.0 for the sulfonylchloride to amino compound and molar ratios of between 5.0 and 1.1 for the base to amino compound are used most often. A wide range of concentrations may be employed i.e., 0.1 5M . Generally concentrations in the range of 0.5 2M are used to give a homogeneous reaction which proceeds at a convenient rate. In addition it is sometimes advantageous to use a combination of pyridine derived base catalysts and tertiary amine bases. The use of pyridine as a solvent is convenient as the pyridine can serve both as a solvent and catalyst in the transformation. An additional alternative route to compounds of general formula I is illustrated in Scheme I. In cases where the amino compound ArNH₂ is less reactive less nucleophic is it advantageous to prepare a metal derivative of the amino compound by treatment with a strong base. The corresponding, amide bases are generally prepared in ether solvents i.e., THF using strong bases such as alkali metal alkyls i.e., Sulfonyl chlorides IV are new and represent key intermediates in the synthesis of sulfonamides I. Sulfonyl chlorides IV may be prepared according to routes outlined in Scheme II. Mercaptan V may be converted to sulfonyl chloride IV by treatment with Cl₂ in an aqueous acidic medium. Generally the medium would be aqueous acetic acid or aqueous HCl. The temperature of the reaction mixture is generally maintained between 20 C and 25 C during the course of the chlorine addition. Most preferably, temperature ranges between 20 C and 0 C are employed to minimize unwanted side reactions such as hydrolysis of IV to the corresponding sulfonic acid. Alternatively, the mercaptan V may be suspended in a two phase system of aqueous acid i.e., HCl and an organic solvent i.e., CH₂Cl₂ and treated with sodium hypochlorite. This serves to convert V to the sulfonyl chloride IV in a reproducibly good yield. The solubility of the product in the organic phase serves to protect it from hydrolysis to the sulfonic acid. Again, temperatures in the range of 20 C to 25 C are employed with temperatures in the range of 5 C to 5 C being most generally used. Compounds of general structure V or VI may be prepared by routes illustrated in Scheme III. Some derivatives of structures V and VI are known materials i.e., V,X Z Me, Y H and VI, X Z Me, Y H prepared by methods described in In instances where the 1,3 dicarbonyl compound is unsymmetrical, the possibility of obtaining two different isomers from condensation with VIII exists. In general, under acidic conditions the exocyclic nitrogen in VIII is the first to condense with the 1,3 dicarbonyl compound. Under basic conditions the endocyclic nitrogen in VIII is sometimes more reactive. Consequently, in situations where a clear difference in reactivity of the two carbonyl functionalities in the 1,3 dicarbonyl compound exists, some measures of regiochemical control may be achieved by choice of reaction conditions i.e., entries 2 and 3 in Table I . To prepare the alternative regioisomer to that depicted in entry 4 in Table A i.e., VI,X R, Y R and Z OH a route illustrated in Scheme IV was followed. Compound VIII was condensed with 2,3 dibromocarboxylic acid esters to yield VI X R, Y R , Z OH . The reaction is generally carried out in refluxing pyridine. An additional route to compounds of type VI involves condensation of compound VIII with methanaminium compounds of type IX as illustrated in Scheme V. The condensation is usually carried out by reaction in refluxing glacial acetic acid and is useful in the synthesis of a number of 6 substituted 1,2,4 triazolo 1,5 a pyrimidines. SCHEME V. In the synthetic routes listed above, compounds of type VI where X and or Z is OH are capable of undergoing further transformation Scheme VI . For example, treatment of compound VI X and or Z OH with phosphorus oxychloride yields VI X and or Z Cl . The reaction is generally carried out at reflux in neat phosphorus oxychloride or with phosphorous oxychloride in a solvent i.e.CH₃CN . Compound VI X and or Z Cl can be further reacted with nucelophiles i.e., NaOCH₃, MeMgBr to yield VI X and or Z OCH₃ or CH₃, respectively . In addition compound VI X and or Z Cl may be reduced to afford VI X and or Z H . An effective reducing agent for this type of transformation is zinc copper couple in the presence of acid. Other compounds of the present invention are best prepared in a manner illustrated in Scheme VII. Compounds such as is represented by structure XI wherein X¹ and Z In addition certain compounds of the present invention containing a halogen in the 6 position on the 1,2,4 triazolo 1,5 a pyrimidine ring system may be prepared by halogenation of the corresponding 6 unsubstituted compound. This is illustrated in Scheme VIII. In general N halo succinimide derivatives are the halogenating agents of choice. Reactions are often performed in acid solvents at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 150 C. Compounds of the present invention represented by structure II are derived from compounds represented by structure I as illustrated in Scheme IX . The derivatization procedure involves treatment of compound I with a base in a suitable solvent followed by the introduction of an appropriate electrophilic derivatizing reagent. From this process compounds of general structure II can be isolated in good yields. Suitable bases include tertiary alkylamines i.e., triethylamine , pryidine, 4 dimethylaminopyridine alkali metal carbonate i.e., Na₂CO₃ or K₂CO₃ and alkali metal alkoxides i.e., sodium ethoxide or potassium Compounds of the present invention represented by structure III are also derived from compounds represented by structure I as illustrated in Scheme X. The general process involves the reduction of compounds of general structured I with an appropriate reducing agent in a suitable solvent to yield compounds of general structure III. Reducing agents which are effective include metal hydrides i.e., sodium borohydride in the presence of acids i.e., methane sulfonic acid and hydrogen in the presence of normal hydrogenation catalysts i.e., palladium on carbon . For reductions with metal hydrides polar aprotic solvents i.e., DMSO are most frequently used. For reductions using hydrogen and a catalyst,alcohols i.e., ethanol are most frequently employed as solvents. A number of the amino compounds ArNH₂ used to prepare the compounds of the present invention are derivatives of anthranilic acid. Many of these compounds can be prepared according to conventional methods described by S. J. Holt et al., A number of the amino compounds are prepared by reduction of anthranilic acids or esters and subsequent derivatization of the reduction product. This is outlined in Scheme XII. The carbinol reduction products may be derivatized by reaction with base and various electrophiles i.e., alkyl halides and carboxylic acid chlorides . A large number of the amino compounds utilized in the preparation or the compounds of this invention contain halogen substituents A number of the amino compounds used as starting materials for the compounds of this invention contain sulfur substituents in the Some starting amino compounds containing amino, alkylamino, aryloxy or pyridyloxy groups were prepared by catalytic reduction of the corresponding nitro compounds. The amino, alkylamino, aryloxy or pyridyloxy group were usually introduced Other starting amino compounds were prepared by procedures involving metalation of the aromatic ring of N substituted derivatives i.e., Other aromatic amino compounds used to prepare compounds of the present invention are prepared by conversion of carboxylic acid groups or derivatives of carboxylic acid groups to amino groups by standard methodology. Such a transformation is illustrated in Scheme XIV and described in Other amino compounds such as those which are heteroaromatic amino compounds are prepared by known procedures such as those described in The table which follows contains a listing of aromatic amino compounds prepared by methods described above and not previously described in known art which are useful in the preparation of the biologically active compounds of this invention.

The crude product was Kugelrohr distilled to yield the desired product as a liquid, bp 102 103 C 10 mm . IR and ¹H NMR spectra were in agreement with the assigned structure. The compounds prepared employing the above general procedures and the appropriate starting materials are tabulated in the following The compounds of the present invention are highly effective herbicides. They have utility for broadspectrum pre and or postemergence weed control in areas where complete vegetation control is desired. The subject compounds are also useful for selective pre and or postemergence weed control in crops such as wheat. Certain of these compounds are effective for the control of nutsedge For all such uses, unmodified active ingredients of the present invention can be employed. However, the present invention embraces the use of a herbicidally effective amount of the active ingredients in composition form with an inert material known in the art as an agricultural adjuvant or carrier in solid or liquid form. Such adjuvants or carriers must not be phytotoxic to valuable crops particularly at the concentration employed in applying the composition in attempting selective weed control in the presence of crops. If weed control is desired in the absence of crops, it is generally sufficient to employ adjuvants or carriers which do not leave a persistent phytotoxic residue. Thus, for example, an active ingredient can be dispersed on a finely divided solid and employed therein as a dust. Also, the active ingredients, as liquid concentrates or solid compositions comprising one or more of the active ingredients can be dispersed in water, typically with aid of a wetting agent, and the resulting aqueous dispersion employed as a spray. In other procedures the active ingredients can be employed as a constituent of organic liquid compositions, oil in water and water in oil emulsions or dispersions, with or without the addition of wetting, dispersing, or emulsifying agents. Suitable adjuvants of the foregoing type are well known to those skilled in the art. The methods of applying the solid or liquid herbicidal formulations similarly are well known to the skilled artisan. Organic solvents that can be employed include toluene, xylene, kerosene, diesel fuel, fuel oil, and petroleum naphtha, ketones such as acetone, methylethyl ketone and cyclohexanone, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as trichloroethylene, and perchloroethylene, esters such as ethyl acetate, amyl acetate and butyl acetate, ethers, e.g., ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, alcohols, e.g., methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, amyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylcarbitol acetate and glycerine. Mixtures of water and organic solvents, either as emulsions or solutions, can be employed. The active ingredients of the present invention can also be applied as aerosols, e.g., by dispersing them by means of a compressed gas such as one of the fluorocarbons or one of its hydrocarbon successors. The active ingredients of the present invention can also be applied with solid adjuvants or carriers such as talc, pyrophyllite, synthetic fine silica, attapulgus clay, kieselguhr, chalk, diatomaceous earth, lime, calcium carbonate, bentonite, Fuller s earth, cotton seed hulls, wheat flour, soybean flour, pumice, tripoli, wood flour, walnut shell flour, redwood flour and lignin. As stated, it is frequently desirable to incorporate a surface active agent in the compositions of the present invention. Such surface active or wetting agents are advantageously employed in both the solid and liquid compositions. The surface active agent can be anionic, cationic or nonionic in character. Typical classes of surface active agents include alkyl sulfonate salts, alkylaryl sulfonate salts, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols and the alkylene oxide addition products of such esters, and addition products of long chain mercaptans and alkylene oxides. Typical examples of such surface active agents include the sodium alkylbenzene sulfonates having 10 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, alkyl phenol ethylene oxide condensation products, e.g., p isooctylphenol condensed with 20 ethylene oxide units, soaps, e.g., sodium stearate and potassium oleate, sodium salt of propylnaphthalene sulfonic acid, di 2 ethylhexyl ester of sodium sulfosuccinic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium decyl sulfonate, sodium salt of the sulfonated monoglyceride of coconut fatty acids, sorbitan sesquioleate, lauryl trimethyl ammonium chloride, octadecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, polyethylene qlycol lauryl ether, polyethylene glycol esters of fatty acids and rosin acids, e.g., Ethofat 7 and 13, sodium N methyl N oleyl taurate, sodium dibutylnaphthalene sulfonate, sodium lignin sulfonate, polyethylene glycol stearate, sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, tertiary dodecyl polyethylene glycol thioether nonionic 218 , long chain ethylene oxide propylene oxide condensation products e.g., Pluronic 61 molecular weight about 1000 , polyethylene glycol ester of tall oil acids, sodium octophenoxyethoxyethyl sulfate, tris polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate Tween 60 , and sodium dihexylsulfosuccinate. The herbicidally effective concentration of the active ingredients in solid or liquid compositions generally is from about 0.0003 to about 95 percent by weight or more. Concentrations from about 0.05 to about 50 percent by weight are often employed. In compositions to be employed as concentrates, the active ingredient can be present in a concentration from about 5 to about 98 weight percent, preferably 15 50 weight percent. The active ingredient compositions can also contain other compatible additaments, for example, phytotoxicants, plant growth regulants, pesticides and the like and can be formulated with solid particulate fertilizer carriers such as ammonium nitrate, urea and the like. In further embodiments, the compounds of the present invention or compositions containing the same, can be advantageously employed in combination with one or more additional pesticidal compounds. Such additional pesticidal compounds may be insecticides, nematocides, miticides, arthropodicides, herbicides, fungicides or bactericides that are compatible with the compounds of the present invention in the medium selected for application. In such embodiments, the pesticidal compound is employed as a supplemental toxicant for the same or for a different pesticidal use or as an additament. The compounds of the present invention are particularly useful in combination with other herbicides including the substituted urea herbicides such as 3 3,4 dichlorophenyl 1,1 dimethylurea, 3 3,4 dichlorophenyl 1 methoxy 1 methylurea Lorox and 1,1 dimethyl 3 α,α,α trifluoro m tolyl urea Cotoran the triazines such as 2 chloro 4 ethylamino 6 isopropylamino s triazine and 2 chloro 4 1 cyano 1 methylethylamino 6 ethylamino s triazine Bladex the uracils such as 5 bromo 3 sec butyl 6 methyluracil N phosphonomethyl glycine the phenoxys such as 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid picolinic acids such as 4 amino 3,5,6 trichloropicolinic acid Tordon and 3,6 dichloropicolinic acid Lontrel 4 chloro 2 butynyl 3 chlorophenyl carbamate Carbyne diisopropylthiocarbamic acid, ester with 2,3 dichloroallyl alcohol Avadex diisopropylthiocarbamic acid, ester with 2,3,3 trichloroallyl alcohol Avadex BVD ethyl N benzoyl N 3,4 dichlorophenyl 2 aminopropionate Suffix 1,2 dimethyl 3,5 diphenylpyrazolium methylsulfate Avenge methyl 2 4 2,4 dichlorophenoxy phenoxy propanoate Hoelon butyl 2 4 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propanoate Fusilade esters of 2 4 3 chloro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propionic acid 4 amino 6 tert butyl 3 methylthio 1,2,4 triazin 5 4H one Lexone 3 isopropyl lH 2,1,3 benzothiadiazin 4 3H one 2,2 dioxide α,α,α trifluoro 2,6 dinitro N,N dipropyl p toluidine 1,1 dimethyl 4,4 bipyridinium ion 2 chloro 2 ,6 diethyl methoxymethyl acetanilide and 2 1 ethoxyimino butyl 5 2 ethylthio propyl 3 hydroxy 2 cyclohexen 1 one Poast . The rates of application for compounds of the invention are determined by a number of factors including the active ingredient being applied, the particular action desired e.g., general or selective control , the plant species to be modified and the stage of growth thereof, the part of the plant to be contacted with the toxic active ingredient, the formulation selected, weather and climate, etc. Thus, it is to be understood that all of the active ingredients of the present invention and compositions containing the same may not be equally effective at similar concentrations or against the same plant species. In non selective preemergence and foliar treatments, the active ingredients of the invention are usually applied at an approximate rate of from about 0.1 to about 10 pounds acre about .11 to about 11.2 kgs hectare In pre and postemergence operations for selective uses, a dosage of about 0.01 to about 10 pounds acre about 0.011 to about 11.2 kg hectare is generally applicable, a rate of 0.01 to 4 pounds acre 0.011 to 4.5 kgs hectare being preferred. The following example illustrates the effect of the compounds of this invention applied postemergently Plant species in this and other tests were the following In representative operations, each compound to be utilized in a series of tests is dissolved in acetone to one half of the final volume twice the final concentration to be used and the acetone solution in each case is admixed with an equal volume of water containing 0.1 percent by weight of surface active material. The compositions, generally in the nature of an emulsion, were employed to spray separate respective plant species which had been grown to a 2 4 leaf stage in soild of good nutrient content in a greenhouse. Sufficient amounts were employed to provide various application rates as listed in the table. The various beds were positioned side by side and exposed to substantially identical conditions of temperature and light. Each bed was maintained so as to prevent any interaction with test compounds in different seed beds. Other plants were left untreated to serve as controls. After treatment, the plants were maintained for about two weeks under greenhouse conditions conducive for good plant growth and watered as necessary. The specific plant species, test compound and dosage and the percent postermergent control obtained are set forth in the table below. Control refers to the reduction in growth compared to the observed results of the same untreated species. So as to clearly illustrate the phytotoxic properties of the various active ingredients of the present invention applied preemergently, a controlled greenhouse experiment is described below. The seeds of various species of plants were planted in beds of good agricultural soil in a greenhouse. A number of compositions of the present invention, generally in the nature of an aqueous emulsion, were applied at rates listed in the table so as to deposit a predetermined amount of active ingredients uniformly throughout the surface of the bed. Another seed bed was treated only with water to serve as a control. After treatment the seed beds were maintained for two weeks under greenhouse conditions conducive for good plant growth and watered as necessary. The specific plant species, test compound, and dosage and the percent preemergent control are set forth in the table below. Control refers to the reduction in growth compared to the observed results of the same untreated species. Certain of the compounds of this invention have been found to be useful for the control of aquatic weeds and some of these are useful for the selective control of, e.g., barnyardgrass and yellow nutsedge in paddy fields in the presence of rice. The following example illustrate the utility of the compounds of this invention in aquatic weed control. In testing for such utility, the plant species to be tested were transplanted into 16 oz. containers into about 2 inches It has further been found that soil nitrogen may be conserved and plant nutrition improved by treating plant growth media with the novel compounds of this invention. By the practice of the embodiment of the invention, the nitrification of ammonium nitrogen in the soil to nitrate nitrogen is suppressed, thereby preventing the rapid loss of ammonium nitrogen from the soil. Furthermore, by proper distribution of the novel compounds, this action of inhibiting the transformation of ammonium nitrogen to nitrate nitrogen is effective over a prolonged period of time including those situations where treated fertilizer is stored for some time before use. The ammonium nitrogen may arise from added ammonium nitrogen fertilizers or be formed in the soil by conversion of the organic nitrogen constituents found in soil or added thereto as components of organic fertilizers. The provision of an effective but sublethal dosage of the active ingredient in the soil or growth medium is essential for the practice of the present invention. In general, good results are obtained when the growth medium is impregnated with the active ingredient in the amount of from 0.01 part to 100 parts or more by weight per million parts by weight of growth medium. Hereinafter, the abbreviation ppm when employed is meant to designate parts by weight of active ingredient per million parts by weight of soil or growth medium. The preferred amounts to be employed are dependent upon the particular situation. Thus, in determining the amount to be employed, consideration is made not only of the treatment need, i.e., soil pH, temperature, soil type, etc., but also of the mode of application to the soil. When the active ingredient is to be applied in a broadcast application, the concentration may frequently be less than in row or band application where for a substantial depth and width within the vicinity of application there may be a very high concentration of the active ingredient. When application is made near the root zone of growing plants or when application is made immediately prior to seeding or transplanting, the amounts supplied are frequently at a lower rate than when application is made at the end of the growing season to prepare the soil for the following season. By dispersing very large dosages in growth media, a prolonged inhibition of nitrification may be obtained over a period of many months. The concentration of the active ingredient is eventually reduced to a minimum by decomposition in the soil. In one method for carrying out this embodiment of the invention, the active ingredient is distributed throughout the growth media in a broadcast application such as by spraying, dusting, distributing in irrigation water, etc. In such application, the active ingredient is supplied in amounts sufficient to permeate the growing area of soil with an amount of from 0.05 to 1000 ppm. In field administration, the active ingredient may be distributed in the soil in the amount of at least 0.05 pound per acre 0.056 kg hectare and through such cross section of the soil as to provide for the presence therein of an effective concentration of the agent. It is usually preferred that the active ingredient be distributed to a depth of at least two inches 5.08 cm below the soil surface and at a dosage of at least 0.1 pound per acre 0.112 kg hectare . In another method for carrying out the present invention, the active ingredient is administered to the growth medium in a band or row application. In such application, administration is made with or without carrier in an amount sufficient to supply to soil or growth medium a concentration of the active ingredient which may be as high as 4000 ppm or more. After administration with or without discing or dragging, subsequent irrigation or rainfall distributes the active ingredient throughout the growth medium. In one embodiment of the present invention, the active ingredient is distributed throughout the growth media prior to seeding or transplanting the desired crop plant. In another embodiment, the soil in the root zone of growing plants is treated with the active ingredient in an amount effective to inhibit nitrification. Oftentimes, it is desirable to treat the soil adjacent to plants, and this procedure may be carried out conveniently in side dressing operations. In a further embodiment, soil may be treated with the compounds following harvest or after fallowing to prevent rapid loss of ammonium nitrogen and to build up the ammonium nitrogenformed by conversion of organic nitrogen compounds. Such practice conserves the soil nitrogen for the following growing season. In such application, the upper limit is primarily an economic consideration. In an additional embodiment, the soil is treated with the active ingredient in conjunction with the application of reduced nitrogen fertilizers. The treatment with the active ingredient may be carried out prior to, subsequent to or simultaneously with the application of fertilizers. Such practice prevents the rapid loss of the ammonium nitrogen added as fertilizer and of the ammonium nitrogen formed from organic nitrogen in fertilizers by the action of soil microorganisms. The administration to the soil of the active ingredient in an ammonium nitrogen or ammonium nitrogen forming fertilizer composition constitutes a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The present invention may be carried out by distributing the active ingredient in an unmodified form through growth medium. The present method also embraces distributing the active ingredient as a constituent in liquid or finely divided solid compositions. In such practice, the active ingredient may be modified with one or more additaments or soil treating adjuvants including water, petroleum distillates or other liquid carriers, surface active dispersing agents, finely divided inert solids and nitrogen fertilizers. Depending upon the concentration of the active ingredient, such augmented composition may be distributed in the soil without further modification or be considered a concentrate and subsequently diluted with additional inert carrier to produce the ultimate treading composition. The required amount of the active ingredient may be supplied to growth media in an organic solvent carrier, in an aqueous carrier or in a solid carrier. When an organic solvent carrier is employed, it may be further dispersed in an aqueous liquid carrier. The concentration of the active ingredient in compositions to be employed for the treatment of growth mediais not critical and may vary considerably provided the required dosage of effective agent is supplied to the growth media. The concentration of theactive ingredient may vary from 0.00001 percent by weight to 95 percent by weight of the composition, depending on whether the composition is a treating composition or a concentrate composition and whether it is in the form of a solid or a liquid. In aqueous liquid treating compositions, concentrations of from 0.00001 percent to 0.25 percent by weight of the active ingredient is considered the preferred composition. The concentration of the active ingredient in organic solvents may be from 2 to 95 percent by weight. Concentrate liquid compositions generally contain from 2.5 to 95 percent by weight of the active ingredient. Treating compositions generally contain. from 0.0001 percent to 10 percent by weight of the active ingredient while concentrate compositions contain from 2.5 to 95 percent. Liquid compositions containing the desired amount of the active ingredient may be prepared by dispersing the latter in one or more liquid carriers such as water or an organic solvent, with or without the aid of a suitable surface active dispersing agent or emulsifying agent. Suitable organic solvents include acetone, diisobutylketone, methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, toluene, methylene chloride, chlorobenzene and the petroleum distillates. The preferred organic solvents are those which are of such volatility that they leave little permanent residue in the soil. When the solutions of the active ingredient in organic solvents are to be further diluted to produce aqueous dispersions, the preferred solvents include acetone and the alcohols. When the liquid carrier is entirely organic in nature, particularly desirable carriers are the petroleum distillates boiling almost entirely under 400 F 204 C at atmospheric pressure and having a flash point above 100 F 38 C . Dispersing and emulsifying agents which may be employed in liquid compositions include condensation products of alkylene oxides with phenols and organic acids, alkyl aryl sulfonates, polyoxyalkylene derivatives of sorbitan esters, complex ether alcohols, mahogany soaps and the like. The surface active agents are generally employed in the amount of from 1 to 20 percent by weight of the active ingredient. Solid compositions containing the active ingredient may be prepared by dispersing the latter in finely divided inert solid carriers such as talc, chalk, gypsum, vermiculite, bentonite and the like, fuller s earth, attapulgite and other clays various solid detergent dispersing agents and solid fertilizer compositions. In preparing such compositions, the carrier is mechanically ground with the active ingredient or wet with a solution or dispersion thereof in a volatile organic solvent. Depending upon the proportions of ingredients, these compositions may be employed without further modification or be considered concentrates and subsequently further diluted with solid surface active dispersing agent, talc, chalk, gypsum or the like to obtain the desired treating composition. Furthermore, such concentrate compositions have the properties of wettable powders and may be dispersed in water with or without added dispersing agent or agents to prepare aqueous soil treating compositions. Soil treatment compositions may be prepared by dispersing the active ingredient in fertilizers such as ammonium fertilizer or organic nitrogen fertilizer. The resulting fertilizercomposition may be employed as such or may be modified as by dilution with additional nitrogen fertilizer or with inert solid carrier to obtain a composition containing the desired amount of active agent for the treatment of soil. Further, an aqueous dispersion of the active ingredient fertilizer composition may be prepared and administered to the growth medium. Fertilizer compositions comprising the active ingredient in intimate admixture with ammonium fertilizers constitute preferred embodiments of the present invention. In fertilizer compositions comprising a reduced nitrogen fertilizer, it is desirable that the active ingredient be present in an amount of at least 0.05 percent by weight basedon the weight of the nitrogen present in the fertilizer as reduced nitrogen and may be present in amounts as high as 95 percent by weight of the reduced nitrogen in the fertilizer. Thus, when a fertilizer composition contains both reduced nitrogen and other forms of nitrogen such as in the case of ammonium nitrate fertilizer compositions, the amount of the active ingredient is based on the weight of nitrogen present in the ammonium component. In operations carried out in accordance with the present invention, the soil may be treated in any convenient fashion with the active compound or a composition containing the latter. For example, these modified or unmodified compositions may be mechanically mixed with soil applied to the surface of soil and thereafter dragged or disced into the soil to a desired depth or transported into the soil with a liquid carrier wuch as by injection, spraying or irrigation. When the distribution is carried out by introducing the compound in the water employed to irrigate the soil, the amount of water is varied in accordance with the moisture content of the soil in order to obtain a distribution of the compound to the desired depth. The compound may be readily and conveniently distributed to a depth of a few inches to four feet by irrigation methods. The preferred methods embrace procedures using any of these steps or combination of steps wherein the compound is distributed in the soil substantially simultaenously with a reduced nitrogen fertilizer. A number of the compounds of this invention were tested for their ability to reduce the rate of nitrification of ammonium nitrogen, applied as ammonium phosphate to the soil. The activity is reported in the following table. The test method comprised selecting a soil which had a low nitrate concentration and good nitrification activity. A sufficient volume of water was added to 20 g of the soil in a wide mouth, screw cap, 4 ounce, glass bottle, such that the moisture content of the mixture was made equal to the 1 3 bar tension value for that soil. The mixture was thoroughly mixed before sealing. The added water contained 5 mg 250 ppm of nitrogen in the form of NH₄ ₂HPO₄ 23.6 mg of ammonium phosphate and the desired quantity of test chemical i.e., 20 mg for a 1 ppm concentration based on dry weight of soil . When the test chemical had a low water solubility, it was compounded in acetone or other suitable solvent in such a way that the final mixture in the soil contained no more than 10 µl of acetone. Acetone slows the rate of soil nitrification and its concentration must be carefully controlled. Single samples of each test chemical were incubated for two weeks at 27 C. The experiment comprised the following types of samples The soil samples were analyzed as follows Sufficient ammonium sulfate extracting solution was added to the sample, such that the total volume of added water was 50 ml included water added during sample preparation . The capped mixture was shaken 10 minutes to solubilize nitrate and the soil particulates were allowed to settle. The nitrate concentration in the water phase was determined with a nitrate specific ion electrode such as Orion Model 93 07. The non nitrate nitrogen remaining NH₄ N remaining in the soil after two weeks performance value was calculated as follows Additionally, certain compounds of the present invention may be used to modify plant growth benefically such as the inhibition of bolting in sugarbeets. Other compounds of the present invention alter the normal growth of sugarbeets by stunting the plant. Both of the effects described above are not accompanied by any phytotoxic symptoms. Sugar beet flowering is controlled by a cold weather treatment of the plants vernalization followed by long days. As the days lengthen, the beets produce bolters elongated stems bearing flowers and ultimately seeds on indeterminate, multibranced racemes. In Europe where a large acreage of sugar beet is grown, cold spring, weather following sowing is often enough to induce bolting of the beets. This bolting causes various problems to the farmer who grows the beet for the sugar content of the beet root. The problems are numerous If bolting could be completely prevented, this would be a possible means of realizing the potential physiological advantages of autumn sowing. Greater utilization of the season would be achieved by the capturing of radiation which normally falls on bare ground. Yield increases of up to 25 have been predicted from autumn as opposed to spring sowing. Even an earlier spring sowing promises an increase in yield. The following example illustrates the plant growth regulator effects of the compounds of this invention. Using a regular biennial variety, even a bolting susceptible variety would require a cold treatment of around 10 16 weeks plus a hormone treatement in conjunction with specific light intensities. Thus, for a screening organism, we selected one which would consistently produce bolting on a regular schedule. The screen is run with an annual sugar beet variety SLC03 provided by Dr. Richard J. Hecker, Fort Collins, Colorado. This variety is an inbred which bolts in the 6 to 8 leaf stage without any need for vernalization. This allows the screen to be run entirely in the greenhouse with all 110 chemical compounds tested on one tray. The sugarbeets are grown in 3 x 3 inch square pots in a greenhouse sandy loam potting mix. The sugarbeets are sprayed with test compounds when they are 2 to 3 weeks old 2 true leaves . The compounds are dissolved in acetone and diluted with water containing Tween 20 as a wetting agent. The concentration of acetone in the final spray is 20 and the concentration of Tween 20 is 0.05 percent. The plants are examined for the appearance of a bolt 4 weeks after spraying. Preemergence tests ace conducted by spraying formulated chemical on seeds placed on potting soil. The sprayed seeds are then covered with ¼ inch of potting soil and the pots are watered. Bolting is evaluated 6 7 weeks after the initiation of the test. At this time, untreated plants have a vigorous bolting stem with visible flowers.
