# A method of epimerization of alkyl chrysanthemate.

## Abstract
Cis chrysanthemate esters are isomerized by contact with a Lewis acid, to transform the cis chrysanthemate ester into trans chrysanthemate ester through epimerization at Câ‚ƒ position. The starting cis chrysanthemate ester may be of any optical isomer ratio of form to form, including racemic form. The process is particularly suitable for use in the preparation of a trans chrysanthemate ester from which trans chrysanthemic acid can readily be prepared, the latter being an important acid component of pyrethroidal insecticides.
