# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MEASURING IN SITU EARTHEN STRESSES AND PROPERTIES USING A BOREHOLE PROBE

## Abstract
A borehole probe 36 includes a soft outer plastic cylin der 42 secured to a central mandrel 39 and inflatable by hydraulic pressure conducted therethrough to impinge upon the sidewall of a borehole 22 with controlled pressure. A plurality of LVDT diameter sensors 67 are secured to the probe 36 in planes perpendicular to the axis thereof and spaced angularly thereabout. A plurality of acoustic trans ducers 73 is also secured to the exterior of the probe to monitor acoustic emissions as well as to survey the earthen media with ultrasonic emissions. The cylinder inflation pressure is increased gradually to exceed both the tensile strength of the media and also the principal stress therein to initiate fracture of the media sur rounding the borehole. The cylinder 42 is then deflated to unload the fractured media, and gradually reinflated to first elastically deform the fractured media and then re expand the fractures previously created. The diameter data together with the hydraulic pressure and the acoustic emissions data and ultrasonic data are analysed to determine the major and minor stress fields in the media, and also the tensile strength, yield strength, and deformation characteristics of the borehole media. The construction of the probe and the diameter measuring means may be varied when higher pressures are to be used and greater changes in diameter are expected.
