# Aluminium filled compositions.

## Abstract
Polymerizable acrylic monomer adhesive systems com prising thirty to eighty percent by weight powdered aluminum filler material are disclosed. More specifically, the adhesive compositions comprise at least one polymerizable acrylate monomer system an effective amount for initiation of a free radical initiator and elemental atomized aluminum metal powder or powdered alumina.
