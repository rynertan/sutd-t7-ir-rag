# Process for determining and controlling the composition of aqueous solutions of NH3 and CO2.

## Abstract
A process for determining the composition of an aqueous solution of ammonia and carbon dioxide from which ammonium carbamate or ammonium carbonate cry stallizes out upon cooling to below the saturation temperatu re. The density and the saturation temperature of the solution are measured, and the ammonia, carbon dioxide, and water composition is determined by reference to densities and saturation temperatures of aqueous solutions of ammonia and carbon dioxide of known composition. The composition thus determined can be used to effect control over the composition of such aqueous solutions.
