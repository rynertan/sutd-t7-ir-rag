## Description
This invention relates to a heat developable light sensitive material containing an organic silver salt. More particularly, it relates to a heat develop able light sensitive material having improved activity and preservability. Heat developable photographic light sensitive materials and the image formation process thereof are well known in the art and are described, e.g., in Organic silver salts used in heat developable light sensitive materials typically include silver salts of aliphatic carboxylic acids or aromatic carboxylic acids. Silver salts of aliphatic carboxylic acids having a thioether group as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,330,663 are also employed. However, these conventional carboxylic acid silver salts have a disadvantage in that reaction between these silver salts and a reducing agent results in release of an acid, which reduces the pH of a layer. As a result, the subsequent development may be inhibited. Organic silver salts, other than the carboxylic acid salts described above, have been employed and include silver salts of compounds having a mercapto group or thione group or derivatives thereof. In addi tion, Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 30270 69 and 18416 70 disclose silver salts of compounds having an imino group, such as benzotriazole and its derivatives. These silver salts, however, involve a disadvantage in that reaction with a reducing agent results in a release of a compound that causes develop ment inhibition and, in some cases, fogging. Further, some of these compounds inhibit the activity of spectral sensitizing dyes. This results in failure to obtain high sensitivity. In order to eliminate these disadvantages, heat decomposable organic silver salts have been proposed in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 211454 85 the term OPI as used herein refers to a published unexamined Japanese patent application corresponding to European Patent No. 143,424 A2 . Although these compounds are excellent in providing images of high density in a short time, they are still unsatisfactory in terms of stability during preservation and need further improvement. Heat developable light sensitive materials frequently contain a base or a base precursor for heat development acceleration. In particular, a base precursor capable of releasing a basic material upon heat decomposition has been employed to advantage in view of preservability. In this case, as the content of the base precursor in the light sensitive material increases, development is accelerated but, in turn, unfavorable side effects, such as increase in fog, inhibition on sensitizing dyes, and the like, are accompanied. Therefore, it is desirable to use such a base precursor in a low concentration as possible. As a result of the above, it has been desired to develop a highly active organic silver salt that can provide images of high density with a small amount of a base precursor. An object of this invention is to provide a heat developable light sensitive material which can provide images of high density with less fog in a short time in the presence of a small amount of a base precursor without producing any side effect after heat development. The above object has been met by a heat developable light sensitive material which comprises a support having provided thereon at least a light sensitive silver halide, a reducing agent, a binder and an organic silver salt represented by the formula I In the above described formula I , R₁ repre sents a hydrogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted alkynyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group or a substituted or unsubsti tuted heterocyclic group. Substituents for the groups as represented by R₁ except for a hydrogen atom include a halogen atom, an alkyl group, an aryl group, an alkoxy group, a carbamoyl group, an N arylcarbamoyl group, an alkynyl group, an acylamido group, etc. These substit uents may further be substituted with the above enumer ated substituents. Specific examples of the substituents are a chlorine atom, a methyl group, a phenyl group, Specific preferred examples of R₁ include a hydrogen atom an alkyl group having from 1 to 11 carbon atoms, e.g., a methyl group, an isopropyl group, a t butyl group, etc. a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms, e.g., a phenyl group, a p chlorophenyl group, a p methoxyphenyl group, etc. a cycloalkyl group having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, e.g., a cyclopentyl group, a cyclohexyl group, etc. an aralkyl group having from 7 to 12 carbon atoms, e.g., a benzyl group, a β phenethyl group, etc. a styryl group a phenylethynyl group a 2 thienyl group, a 2 furyl group R₂ represents a hydrogen atom or a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, with a hydrogen atom being preferred. R₃ represents a halogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy group, an acylamino group, a sulfonylamino group, an alkylamino group, a dialkylamino group, a substituted or unsubstituted alkylsulfonyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted arylsulfonyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted carbamoyl group, a substituted or unsubsti tuted sulfamoyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted alkoxycarbonyl group, or a cyano group. Preferred groups for R₃ are a methyl group, a methoxy group, a methoxyethoxy group, a halogen atom, an acylamino group having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, an alkylsulfonylamino group having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, an arylsulfonyl amino group having 6 or 7 carbon atoms, and the like. X represents a divalent group selected from ℓ represents 0 or an integer of from 1 to 3. When ℓ is 2 or 3, the groups of R₃ may be the same or different. Specific examples of the organic silver salts which can preferably be used in the present invention are shown below The organic silver salts of the formula I according to the present invention can be prepared by synthesizing a carboxylic acid according to the following reaction scheme A or B and mixing the carboxylic acid with a silver ion donator, e.g., silver nitrate. A synthesis example of the organic silver salt of the present invention is given below. Into a mixture comprising 224 g of reduced iron, 13.4 g of ammonium chloride, 1 liter of isopropyl alcohol and 0.2 liter of water was added 237 g of ethyl p nitro benzoylacetate in small portions at a temperature between 50 C and 70 C with caution against heat generation. The mixture was allowed to react at 70 C for 1 hour, followed by filtration. To the filtrate was added 1 liter of water, and crystals precipitated upon cooling to 5 C were separated by filtration to obtain 172 g of ethyl p amino benzoylacetate as yellow crystals having a melting point of 82 to 84 C. In 440 mℓ of acetonitrile was dissolved 146 g of ethyl p aminobenzoylacetate, and 70 mℓ of acetic anhydride was added dropwise to the solution at 40 C. After reacting at 40 C for 1 hour, 48.8 g of 80 hydrazine hydrate was added thereto dropwise. After heat generation subsided, the reaction was further continued at a temperature between 55 C and 60 C for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was cooled to 5 C, and the precipitated crystals were filtered to yield 148 g of 3 4 acetylaminophenyl 2 pyrazolin 5 one as gray crystals having a melting point of 254 to 258 C. Into a mixture of 69 g of the above obtained crystals and 330 mℓ of acetonitrile was dropped 33.4 mℓ of bromine at a temperature of 15 C or lower. After stirring for 1 hour, the resulting yellow mixture was added dropwise to 500 mℓ of an aqueous solution contain ing 76 g of sodium hydroxide at a temperature of 15 C or lower, followed by allowing the mixture to stand over night. Water was added thereto to make 2 liters, and 90 mℓ of 35 hydrochloric acid was slowly added thereto. The precipitated yellow crystals were filtered and thoroughly washed with water to obtain crude crystals of p acetylaminophenylpropiolic acid. The resulting crude crystals were added to a solution of 14g of sodium hydroxide in 140 mℓ of water. After stirring at 40 C for 30 minutes, 45 g of sodium chloride was added thereto, whereby a sodium salt of p acetylaminopropiolic acid was precipitated. The mixture was cooled to 10 C, and the precipitate was filtered and thoroughly washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution to obtain white crystals. The resulting crystals were added to 400 mℓ of warm water at 50 C, and any insoluble matter was removed by filtration. To the filtrate was added dropwise 30 mℓ of 35 hydrochloric acid, and the precipitated white crystals were collected by filtration to give 42.5 g of p acetylaminophenyl propiolic acid having a melting point of 183 to 185 C with decomposition . The thus prepared acid was converted to a silver salt in a usual manner. Other organic silver salts could be prepared in the same manner as described above. The organic silver salts of the present inven tion may be prepared either in a system combined with preparation of other components of a heat developable light sensitive material or in an independent system apart from other components of a heat developable light sensitive material. For considerations of ease of control in the preparation or ease of storage, it is preferable to prepare them separately from the other components of a heat developable light sensitive material. The organic silver salts according to the present invention may be used in combination of two or more thereof and, further, in combination with other known organic silver salts. They may be used in a layer containing a light sensitive silver halide or a layer adjacent thereto. The organic silver salts of the present inven tion can be used in a broad range of concentration, i.e., of from 10 mg to 10 g per m² as converted to silver or of from 0.01 to 200 mols, as converted to silver, per mol of light sensitive silver halide. Forms and grain sizes of the organic silver salt of the present invention may arbitrarily be selected, but a preferred mean grain size is 10 µm or smaller. Organic compounds for forming known organic silver salts that can be used in combination with the organic silver salts according to the present invention include aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids, thio carbonyl group containing compounds having a mercapto group or an α hydrogen atom, imino group containing compounds, and so on. Typical examples of silver salts of the aliphatic carboxylic acids are silver salts of behenic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, lauric acid, capric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, furilic acid, linolic acid, linoleic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid or camphoric acid. Silver salts of these aliphatic carboxylic acids substituted with a halogen atom or a hydroxyl group and silver salts of aliphatic carboxylic acids having a thioether group may also be used.

Silver halides to be used include silver chloride, silver chlorobromide, silver chloroiodide, silver bromide, silver iodobromide, silver chloroiodobromide and silver iodide. These silver halides can be obtained, for example, by adding a silver nitrate solution to a potassium bromide solution to form silver bromide grains and then adding potassium iodide thereto. Two or more silver halides having different sizes and or silver halide compositions may be used in combination. The silver halide grains to be used in the present invention preferably have a mean grain size of from 0.001 to 10 µm, and more preferably from 0.001 to 5 µm. The silver halides can be used as such, but may be subjected to chemical sensitization with chemical sensitizing agents, such as compounds of sulfur, selenium, tellurium, etc., and compounds of gold, platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, etc. reducing agents, such as tin halides, etc. or combinations thereof. Details for chemical sensitization are described in T. H. James, The light sensitive silver halide is suitably coated to a silver coverage of from 1 mg to 10 g per m². The silver halide to be used in the present invention may be spectrally sensitized with methine dyes or others. Details for spectral sensitization are described in Japanese Patent Application No. 199891 84, pages 19 22. In the present invention, silver may be used as an image forming material, or various image forming materials can be used in various processes. Examples of dye providing substances which can be used in the present invention include couplers capable of reacting with a developing agent. These couplers are capable of reacting with an oxidation product of a developing agent which results from an oxidation reduction reaction between a silver salt and a developing agent to thereby form a dye. This dye formation system is described in a number of publications. For example, specific examples of developing agents and couplers are described, e.g., in T. H. James, Dye providing substances to be used in the present invention further include dye silver compounds in which an organic silver and a dye are bonded. Specific examples of the dye silver compounds are described in Azo dyes which are used in heat development type silver dye bleach process can also be used as dye providing substances. Specific examples of the azo dyes and the process of bleach are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent 4,235,957, Leuco dyes described in U.S. Patents 3,985,565 and 4,022,617, etc., can also be used as dye providing substances. Further, dye providing substance to be employed includes compounds capable of imagewise releasing or diffusing a diffusible dye which are useful in the system described, e.g., in European Patents 76,492 and 79,056. This type of compounds can be represented by the formula LI Dye X Specific examples of the dye providing substances represented by the formula LI include dye developing agents comprising a hydroquinone type developing agent moiety and a dye moiety as described in U.S. Patents 3,134,764, 3,362,819, 3,597,200, 3,544,545 and 3,482,972, etc. Further, substances which release a diffusible dye through intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction are disclosed in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 63618 76, and substances which release a diffusible dye through intramolecular rearrangement reaction of an isoxazolone ring are disclosed in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 111628 74. In any of the systems in which the above described compounds are employed, a diffusible dye is released or diffused in areas wherein development has not taken place and a dye is neither released nor diffused in areas wherein development has taken place. In these systems, since development and release of dyes proceed in parallel, it is very difficult to obtain images having high S N ratios. In order to eliminate this disadvantage, there has been proposed a system in which a dye providing substance in an oxidized state incapable of releasing a dye is present together with a reducing agent or a precursor thereof and, after development, the dye providing substance in an oxidized state is reduced by the reducing agent remaining unoxidized to thereby release a diffusi ble dye. Specific examples of the dye providing substances used in this system are described in Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 110827 78, 130927 79, 164342 81 and 35533 78. On the other hand, a system, in which a coupler having a diffusible dye moiety as an eliminating group is reacted with an oxidation product of a developing agent to release a diffusible dye in areas where develop ment has taken place, is described in British Patent 1,330,524, Japanese Patent Publication No. 39165 73 and U.S. Patent 3,443,940, etc. Further, a system, in which a coupler having an antidiffusible group as an eliminat ing group is reacted with an oxidation product of a developing agent to form a diffusible dye, is described in U.S. Patent 3,227,550, etc. The above described systems using color developing agents involve a serious problem of image stain due to oxidative decomposition products of a developing agent. For the purpose of overcoming this problem, a dye providing substance having per se a reducing property and requiring no developing agent has been proposed. Typical examples of such a dye providing substance are shown below together with the reference publication. Symbols used in the following formulae are defined in the respective publications Any of the above recited various dye providing substances can be used in the present invention. In the present invention, it is preferable to use, as an image forming substance, a dye providing substance which is reductive to exposed light sensitive silver halide and is capable of reacting with the silver halide upon heating to thereby release a diffusible dye. Inter alia, dye providing substances represented by the formula CI are more preferred IR SO₂ D CI wherein IR represents a reducing substrate which is cleaved in correspondence or countercorrespondence to a light sensitive silver halide having an imagewise latent image to release a dye and which makes a differ ence in mobility between the released dye and a dye providing substance D represents a mobile image forming dye moiety or its precursor which may contain a linking group to SO₂. The reducing substrate IR in the dye provid ing substance IR SO₂ D preferably has an oxidation reduction potential of 1.2 V or less relative to a saturated calomel electrode in a polarographic half wave potential determination using acetonitrile as a solvent and sodium perchloric acid as a supporting electrolyte. Specific examples of the reducing substrate as represented by IR include various groups described in European Patent 76,492, pages 19 24. Among them, groups represented by the following formula CII are preferred.

The hydroxyl group and or amino group in IR represented by the formula CII may be protected with a protective group that can be removed by nucleophilic reagents. In a more preferred embodiment of the present invention, the reducing substrate IR can be represented by the formula CIII Of the groups represented by the formula CIII , the most preferred are those represented by the formula CIIIa or CIIIb Specific examples of the group represented by the formulae CIII , CIIIa and CIIIb are described in U.S. Patent 4,055,428 and Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 12642 81 and 16130 81. A still another preferred reducing substrate IR can be represented by the formula CIV Of the groups represented by the formula CIV , the more preferred are those represented by the formula CIVa , CIVb or CIVc In the above described formula CI , the dye moiety represented by D is derived from azo dyes, azomethine dyes, anthraquinone dyes, naphthoquinone dyes, styryl dyes, nitro dyes, quinoline dyes, carbonyl dyes, phthalocyanine dyes, and the like. This dye moiety may be temporarily shifted to a shorter wavelength side. Specific examples of the dye moieties released from the dye providing substances include those described in European Patent 76,492, pages 24 42. These dye providing substances may be used in combinations of two or more thereof. Such combinations include a combination of two or more dye providing substances which produce the same color and a combination of two or more dye providing substances which form differ ent colors to jointly produce a black color.

Supports which can be used in the light sensitive materials or dye fixing materials should withstand use at processing temperatures. Usually employed supports include glass, paper, metals and the like, as well as acetyl cellulose film, cellulose ester film, polyvinyl acetal film, polystyrene film, poly carbonate film, polyethylene terephthalate film and the related films or other resin materials. Paper supports laminated with polymers, e.g., polyethylene, can also be used. For lamination, the polyesters described in U.S. Patents 3,634,089 and 3,725,070 are preferably used. The photographic emulsion layers and other binder layers of the photographic light sensitive materials and dye fixing materials can contain organic or inorganic hardeners. Specific examples of usable hardeners are described in Japanese Patent Application No. 199891 84, pages 69 70. When the dye providing substance capable of imagewise releasing a diffusible dye is employed, move ment of the dye from a light sensitive layer to a dye fixing layer can be accelerated by a dye transfer assistant. Details for the dye transfer assistant are described in Japanese Patent Application No. 199891 84, pages 70 71. Other compounds which can be used in the light sensitive materials according to the present inven tion include sulfamide derivatives, cation compounds having a pyridinium group etc., surface active agents having a polyethylene oxide chain, antihalation and anti irradiation dyes, hardeners, mordants, and the like. Specific examples of these compounds are described in European Patents 76,492 and 66,282, West German Patent 3,315,485 and Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 154445 84 and Japanese Patent Application No. 26008 83 corresponding to U.S. Patent 4,503,137 . As to methods of exposure and the like, the methods described in the above cited references can be applied. According to the present invention, the heat developable light sensitive materials containing the organic silver salt of the formula I can provide an image of high density and with less fog in a short time with a small amount of a base precursor without giving adverse side effects after heat development. The present invention will now be illustrated in greater detail with reference to the following examples, but it should be understood that these examples are not limiting the present invention. In the examples, all the percents are by weight unless otherwise indicated. In a mixture of 1,000 mℓ of a 0.1 sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and 200 mℓ of ethanol were dissolved 20 g of gelatin and 5.9 g of 4 acetylamino phenylpropiolic acid. The resulting solution was stir red while maintaining at 40 C. A solution of 4.5 g of silver nitrate in 200 mℓ of water was added thereto over 5 minutes. The pH of the resulting dispersion was adjusted to precipitate excessive salts, which were then removed. The dispersion was adjusted to a pH of 6.3 to obtain 300 g of a dispersion of Organic Silver Salt 1 . In the same manner as described above, disper sions of Organic Silver Salts 6 , 22 and 34 were prepared. In 3,000 mℓ of water were dissolved 28 g of gelatin and 13.2 g of benzotriazole, and the solution was stirred while maintaining at 40 C. A solution of 17 g of silver nitrate in 100 mℓ of water was added thereto over 2 minutes. An excess of salts was precipi tated by pH adjustment and removed. The dispersion was then adjusted to a pH of 6.3 to obtain 400 g of a silver benzotriazole emulsion. In 1,000 mℓ of water were dissolved 20 g of gelatin and 3 g of sodium chloride, and the solution was kept at 75 C while stirring. To the gelatin aqueous solution under warming and stirring were added simulta neously 600 mℓ of an aqueous solution containing sodium chloride and potassium bromide and a solution of 0.59 mol of silver nitrate in 600 mℓ of water at equal flow rates over a period of 40 minutes. There was obtained a mono dispersed cubic silver chlorobromide emulsion bromine content 80 mol having a mean grain size of 0.35 µm. After washing with water followed by removal of salts, 5 mg of sodium thiosulfate and 20 mg of 4 hydroxy 6 methyl 1,3,3a,7 tetraazaindene were added thereto to effect chemical sensitization at 60 C. The yield of the emulsion was 600 g. 5 g of Magenta Dye Providing Substance A of the formula The above components a to g were mixed and a thickener poly styrene p sodium sulfonate and water were added thereto to make 100 mℓ. The resulting compo sition was coated on a 180 µm thick polyethylene terephthalate film to a wet film thickness of 50 µm. A protective composition was prepared by mixing The thus produced light sensitive material was designated as Sample 101. Sample 102 was prepared in the same manner as for Sample 101 except that the above described dispersion of Organic Silver Salt 1 of the present invention was used in place of the silver benzotriazole emulsion in an amount so as to result in the same silver coverage as obtained by the silver benzotriazole emulsion. Similarly, Samples 103 to 105 were prepared using the dispersions of Organic Silver Salts 6 , 22 and 34 , respectively, in place of the silver benzo triazole emulsion. Each of Samples 101 to 105 was imagewise exposed to light emitted from a tungsten lamp 2,000 lux through a green filter for 1 second and, thereafter, uniformly heated on a heat block heated at 150 C for 10 seconds. 10 g of poly methyl acrylate co N,N,N trimethyl N vinylbenzylammonium chloride methyl acrylate vinylbenzylammonium chloride 1 1 by mol were dissolved in 200 mℓ of water, and the aqueous solution was uniformly mixed with 100 g of a 10 aqueous solution of lime processed gelatin. The mixture was evenly coated on a paper support laminated with poly ethylene having dispersed therein titanium dioxide to a wet film thickness of 90 µm, followed by drying. The resulting sample was used as a dye fixing material having a mordant layer. After 20 mℓ m² of water was supplied to the coated layer of the dye fixing material, the above prepared light sensitive material having been heated was brought into contact with the dye fixing material in such a manner that the coating layer of both the materials faced each other. After heating for 6 seconds on a heat block at 80 C, the dye fixing material was stripped from the light sensitive material. As a result, a magenta dye image on the dye fixing material was obtained. The magenta density was determined by means of a Macbeth reflection densitometer RD 519 , and the results obtained are shown in Table 1 below. It can be seen from Table 1 that light sensitive materials wherein the organic silver salts according to the present invention are used can provide images of high density and low fog. Onto a polyethylene terephthalate film were coated the following first the lowermost to sixth the uppermost layers to produce a multilayer color light sensitive material Sample 201 . A gelatin aqueous solution consisting of 20 g of gelatin, 3 g of sodium chloride and 1,000 mℓ of water was kept at 75 C under stirring well. To the solution under warming and stirring were added simulta neously 600 mℓ of an aqueous solution containing sodium chloride and potassium bromide and a solution of 0.59 mol of silver nitrate in 600 mℓ of water at equal flow rates over a period of 40 minutes to thereby prepare a mono dispersed cubic silver chlorobromide emulsion bromide content 50 mol having a mean grain size of 0.40 µm. After washing with water and removal of salts, 5 mg of sodium thiosulfate and 20 mg of 4 hydroxy 6 methyl 1,3,3a,7 tetraazaindene to effect chemical sensi tization at 60 C. The yield of the emulsion was 600 g. The silver halide emulsion and silver benzo triazole emulsion used in the third layer were prepared in the same manner as described in Example 1. 5 g of Yellow Dye Providing Substance B having the following formula, 0.5 g of sodium succinic acid 2 ethylhexyl ester sulfonate and 10 g of triisononyl phosphate were dissolved in 30 mℓ of ethyl acetate under heating at about 60 C to form a uniform solution. The solution was mixed with 100 g of a 10 aqueous solution of lime processed gelatin while stirring and dispersed in a homogenizer at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes to prepare a yellow dye providing substance dispersion. A magenta dye providing substance dispersion was prepared in the same manner as described above but using Magenta Dye Providing Substance A as used in Example 1 in place of Yellow Dye Providing Substance B and 7.5 g of tricresyl phosphate as a high boiling point solvent. A cyan dye providing substance dispersion was prepared in the same manner as described for the yellow dye providing substance dispersion but using Cyan Dye Providing Substance C having the following formula in place of Yellow Dye Providing Substance B . Samples 202 to 205 were prepared in the same manner as for Sample 201 except that the dispersion of Organic Silver Salts 1 , 6 , 22 and 34 as used in Example 1 were used to a silver coverage of 100 mg m², respectively, in place of the silver benzotriazole emulsion in the first, third and fifth layers. Sample 206 was prepared in the same manner as for Sample 202 but the coverage of the base precursor in the first, third and fifth layers was reduced to one half. Each of the thus prepared multilayer color light sensitive materials Samples 201 to 206 was exposed to tungsten light 500 lux through G, R and IR separation filters having continuously varying density the G filter and R filter were band transmission filters transmitting light of 500 to 600 nm and light of 600 to 700 nm, respectively and the IR filter transmitted light of more than 700 nm for 1 second. The exposed sample was heated on a heat block at 150 C for 5 seconds or 15 seconds. Water was supplied to the coated surface of the same dye fixing material as used in Example 1 in an amount of 20 mℓ per m², and the light sensitive material was brought into contact with the dye fixing material in such a manner that both the coated surfaces faced each other. After heating on a heat block at 80 C for 6 seconds, the dye fixing material was stripped from the light sensitive material. As a result, yellow, magenta and cyan dye images on the dye fixing material were obtained in correspondence to the three color separation filters G, R and IR. The maximum density Dmax and minimum density Dmin of each color image were determined by the use of a Macbeth reflection densitometer RD 519 . The results obtained are shown in Table 2 below. It can be seen from Table 2 that the light sensitive materials using the organic silver salts of the present invention can provide sufficient image densities even with a short developing time. Further, even if the amount of a base precursor is reduced to one half, images of sufficient densities can be obtained by development processing for 15 seconds. Thus, the requisite amount of a base precursor can be reduced by the present invention. In 3,000 mℓ of water were dissolved 40 g of gelatin and 26 g of potassium bromide, and the solution was kept at 50 C under stirring. A solution of 34 g of silver nitrate in 200 mℓ of water was added to the gelatin aqueous solution over 10 minutes. Thereafter, a solution of 3.3 g of potassium iodide in 1,000 mℓ of water was added thereto over 2 minutes. An excess of salts were precipitated by pH adjustment and removed. The emulsion was adjusted to a pH of 6.0 to obtain 400 g of a silver iodobromide emulsion. A mixture of 10 g of Dye Providing Substance D of the formula d Solution of 1.5 g of guanidine 4 acetylaminophenylpropiolate in 10 mℓ of ethanol and 15 mℓ of water e Solution of 0.4 g of CH₃ ₂NSO₂NH₂ in 4 mℓ of methanol The above components a to e were mixed and dissolved by heating, and the resulting composition was coated on a 180 µm thick polyethylene terephthalate film to a wet thickness of 35 µm, followed by drying. A protective layer having the following composition was then coated thereon to a wet thickness of 25 µm. The resulting light sensitive material was designated as Sample 301. Samples 302 to 305 were prepared in the same manner as described for Sample 301 but replacing 10 , based on a silver coverage, of the silver iodobromide emulsion with dispersions of Organic Silver Salts 1 , 6 , 22 and 34 as used in Example 1, respectively. Sample 306 was prepared in the same manner as for Sample 301 but increasing the amount of the guanidine 4 acetylaminophenylpropiolate to 2.1 g. Each of Samples 301 to 306 was imagewise exposed to light emitted from a tungsten lamp 2,000 lux for 10 seconds and then uniformly heated on a heat block heated at 150 C for 20 seconds. The same dye fixing material as used in Example 1 was dipped in water and then brought into contact with the heated sample in such a manner that both the coating surfaces faced each other. After the laminate was heated on a heat block at 80 C for 6 seconds, the dye fixing material was stripped from the light sensitive material. As a result, a negative magenta dye image on the dye fixing material was obtained. The maximum and minimum densities of the negative image were determined using a Macbeth reflection densitometer RD 519 , and the results obtained are shown in Table 3. It is apparent from the results of Table 3 that images of high densities with less fog can be obtained by using a small amount of the organic silver salts according to the present invention. It can further be seen that use of the organic silver salts of this invention greatly reduces the requisite amount of a base precursor. In 1,000 mℓ of water were disolved 6.5 g of benzotriazole and 10 g of gelatin. The resulting solution was maintained at 50 C with stirring. A solu tion of 8.5 g of silver nitrate in 100 mℓ of water was then added to the above solution over a period of 2 minutes. A solution of 1.2 g of potassium bromide in 50 mℓ of water was then added thereto over 2 minutes. An excess of salts were removed by precipitation by pH adjustment, and the emulsion was adjusted to a pH of 6.0 to obtain 200 g of an emulsion. A mixture of 10 g of Dye Providing Substance E of the formula The above components a to f were mixed and dissolved by heating, and the resulting composition was coated on a 180 µm thick polyethylene terephthalate film to a wet thickness of 30 µm. A protective layer having the following composition was further coated thereon to a wet thick ness of 30 µm, followed by drying. The thus prepared light sensitive material was designated as Sample 401. Sample 402 was prepared in the same manner as for Sample 401 but using an emulsion of Organic Silver Salt 1 containing light sensitive silver bromide as prepared below in place of the silver benzotriazole emulsion containing light sensitive silver bromide. In 300 mℓ of ethanol and 1,000 mℓ of a 1 sodium hydroxide aqueous solution were dissolved 11.1 g of 4 acetylaminophenylpropionic acid and 10 g of gelatin, and the resulting solution was maintained at 50 C while stirring. A solution of 8.5 g of silver nitrate in 100 mℓ of water was added to the above solution over 2 minutes. A solution of 1.2 g of potassium bromide in 50 mℓ of water was then added thereto over a period of 2 minutes. An excess of salts were precipitated by pH adjustment and removed. The emulsion was then adjusted to a pH of 6.0 to obtain 200 g of an emulsion. Each of Samples 401 and 402 was imagewise exposed to light of a tungsten lamp 2,000 lux for 10 seconds and then uniformly heated on a heat block heated at 150 C for 20 seconds. The same dye fixing material as used in Example 1 was dipped in water and brought into contact with the heated sample in such a manner that both the coated surfaces faced each other. After the laminate was heated on a heat block at 80 C for 6 seconds, the dye fixing material was stripped off from the light sensitive material to obtain a negative magenta dye image on the dye fixing material. The densities of the negative image were determined by the use of a Macbeth reflection densitometer RD 519 , and the results obtained are shown in Table 4 below. The results of Table 4 prove that the organic silver salts according to the present invention provide images of high density with less fog. A mixture of 5 g of a reducible dye releasing agent of the formula The above components a to d were mixed and dissolved under heating, and the resulting composition was coated on a polyethylene terephthalate film to a wet thickness of 30 µm, followed by drying. A protective layer having the following composition was further coated thereon to a wet thickness of 30 µm, followed by drying to prepare a light sensitive material Sample 501 . Sample 502 was prepared in the same manner as described above for Sample 501 but using the same Organic Silver Salt 1 emulsion containing light sensitive silver bromide as used in Example 4 in place of the silver benzotriazole emulsion containing light sensitive silver bromide. Each of Samples 501 and 502 was imagewise exposed to light using a tungsten lamp 2,000 lux for 10 seconds, and the exposed sample was heated on a heat block at 140 C uniformly for 30 seconds. The heated sample was processed using the same dye fixing material as used in Example 1 in the same manner as in Example 1 to obtain a positive magenta dye image on the dye fixing material. The densities of the positive image were determined by the use of a Macbeth reflection densitometer RD 519 , and the results are shown in Table 5 below. It can be seen from Table 5 that the organic silver salts according to the present invention are effective to provide images of high densities with less fog in a process of forming a positive image as well. A dye providing substance dispersion was prepared in the same manner as described in Example 1 but using 5 g of a dye providing substance of the formula The above components a to d were mixed and dissolved under heating, and the resulting composition was coated on a 180 µm thick polyethylene terephthalate film to a wet thickness of 30 µm. A protective composi tion having the following formulation was further coated thereon to a wet thickness of 25 µm, followed by drying. The resulting sample was designated as Sample 601. Sample 602 was prepared in the same manner as described above but using the same emulsion of Organic Silver Salt 1 containing light sensitive silver bromide as used in Example 4 in place of the silver benzotriazole emulsion containing light sensitive silver bromide. Each of Samples 601 and 602 was imagewise exposed to light using a tungsten lamp 2,000 lux for 10 seconds, and the exposed sample was uniformly heated on a heat block at about 160 C for 30 seconds. The heated sample was then processed in the same manner as in Example 1 using the same dye fixing material as used in Example 1. The results obtained are shown in Table 6 below. The results of Table 6 demonstrate that the organic silver salt according to the present invention provides a high density with less fog in an image formation process using no base precursor as well. While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
