## Description
RUBBER BASED COMPOSITION ESPECIALLY FOR MEDICAL COMPONENTSThe invention relates to a rubber based composition, especially for use in medical components, particularly as parts of human or animal infusion sets.Infusion sets are used in the practice of medicine in humans and animals for the transport of fluids such as saline and blood. The human infusion sets as shown in U.S. patent No.3886937, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, comprise tubing or conduits which require rubber components, such as connectors, sleeve stoppers, injection sites and other typical rubber parts.These rubber components have generally been made of pure gum rubber which has been cured by sulphur and other catalysts and accelerators. While such sulphur cured rubber components have functioned very satisfactorily, it has been determined that powerful carcinogens and other undesirable by products may be formed in the vulcanization process.It is known to make the rubber items from a peroxide cured rubber and resin composition, see e.g. U.S. patent 3758643. However, such items are generally unsatisfactory for use in medicine because of poor tear strength and tackiness, poor needle coring properties and poor tensile strength.It is one object of the invention to provide improved rubber based components for use in medicine, e.g. in infusion sets.In particular it is an object to provide a rubber based component with a reduced tendency to damage when a needle is inserted. Another object is to produce components which are sufficiently transparent or translucent so as to reveal the presence of needles and connecting means.According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a peroxide cured rubber based composition comprising a natural or synthetic rubber and a polyolefin characterised in that the composition comprises a major proportion of a natural and or synthetic rubber component and a minor proportion of a high density polyolefin component, these being substantially completely crosslinked by the peroxide curing agent.Most preferably, the rubber component is present in an amount by weight of from 40 to about 90 . The high density polyolefin component is preferably present in an amount by weight of from about 4Z to about 20 . A filler component is preferably present, and in an amount by weight of from about 4 to about 30 .The rubber components preferably comprises a mixture of a synthetic and natural rubber. The synthetic natural rubber has the advantage of giving less amber discoloration than a pale crepe natural rubber. A brominated copolymer synthetic rubber is preferably present and lends aging resistance and eases processing. This ingredient may be present from 0 to 50 by weight. Other grades of natural rubber may be used, depending on the colour desired.Most preferably the high density polyolefin is incorporated as a masterbatch blend with a natural rubber. The masterbatch preferably comprises 75s natural rubber and 25 high density polyethylene. The high density polyethylene can be varied from about 4 to 20 . While polyethylene may be present in a proportion greater than 25 the resulting product may lack rubber like qualities. A preferred polyolefin is high density polyethylene having a density of at least 0.915 and more preferably 0.965 or greater, with a percentage crystallinity as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance at room temperature of approximately 80 or more, and preferably 90 or greater. Other high density polyolefins are suitable. The hardness of the cured rubber composition can be varied from 35 Duro A hardness to 70 Duro A hardness which is a preferred range for pharmaceutical medical grade rubber.The proportion of the high density polyolefin is varied according to the desired Duro A hardness. The hardness increases with increasing content of the polyolefin. For a composition having 98 parts of a mixture of natural and synthetic rubbers, a content of 8 parts high density polyethylene and 12 parts of filler will give a Duro A hardness of about 35. When the polyethylene content is increased to 10 parts the hardness of the cured product is about 55 when the polyethylene content is increased to 20 parts and the filler content to 20 parts, the cured product has a hardness of about 60.A preferred peroxide cure agent is 2, 5 dimethyl 2,5 di tbutyl peroxy hexane sold under Trade marks Varox andLupersol 101 that is present in an amount of 1 part by weight. The peroxide substantially cross links or polymerises all the rubber and the polyolefin components making up the product substantially insoluble in many medical liquids. Other peroxides, such as dicumyl peroxide, which cross link or polymerise hydrocarbon type rubbers and plastics, can also be used.A trimethylolpropane methacrylate is preferably present as an activator for peroxide curing agent and also as a crosslinking agent. Other co agents may also be used. By virtue of the two curing agents there is little or no ingredient or by product to be released as an extractable into a medical environment.The filler is preferably a fine particle silica selected to lend transparency to translucency in the finished product as well as improving tensile strength and tear strength. A preferred filler is fumed, coloidal silica known as Cab OSil MS 7 fumed hydrolyzed silica 0.014 micron particle size . Other inorganic fillers, normally used in the rubber industry, can be used such as clay, blanc fixe and talc.The preferred filler is a very pure fine silica.The amount of filler is usually varied from 5 to 60 or more parts, depending upon the filler used and the desiredDurometer A Hardness. Higher amounts of a given filler have the effect of increasing the Durometer A Hardness which is also controlled by the content of high density polyolefin.A silicone gum is preferably present to improve the processing properties.Tack reducing additives may be present. A low molecular weight low density polyethylene A C Polyethylene 617 , about 2 , and or microcrystaline petroleum wax sold under the Trade Mark Vanwax H , about 1 by weight may be present to prevent surface tack on the finished washed parts.Another optional additive is white petrolatum, U.S.P. grade Petrolatum B in an amount of 1 by weight as a plasticizer tO improve processing properties. Another is zinc stearate in an amount of 0.5 by weight as a stabilizer and to improve aging resistance. Another activator is double pressed stearic acid, which may be present in an amount of 0.5 by weight. Another optional ingredient is Antioxidant 425, a trademark of American Cyanamid Co., 2, 2 methylenebis 6 tert butyl 4 ethyl phenol which is present in an amount of 0.5 by weight to improve resistance to aging and heat. An alternative or additional plasticizer is a synthetic polyterpene resin Nevtac 100 , preferably in a proportion of 1 of total composition.A preferred composition is made up from a formulation comprising the following components Parts by WeightNatural Rubber No. 1 Pale Crepe 20.00Brominated isobutylene isoprene copolymer Bromobutyl X l 10.00 Synthetic cis polyisoprene Natsyn 2200 38.00Masterbatch 10 parts high density polyethylene in 30 parts No 1 pale crepe natural rubber 40.00 Trimethylolp roprane t rimethac rylate Sartomer SR 350 1.00Methyl Vinyl Silicone Gum 410 Silicone Gum 1.00Silica Filler Cab O Sil MS 7 10.00 120.00The invention includes a method of making a composition as disclosed herein characterised by mixing together a major proportion of a natural or synthetic rubber component and a minor proportion of a high density polyolefin component so as to form a dispersion, allowing the dispersion to cool, and adding the peroxide curing agent and heating to form the substantially completely cross linked composition.The invention is illustrated by the following non limitative examples. Example 1Masterbatch 5,48 kilograms was prepared by mixing 40.86 kilograms of No 1 thick crepe NR and 13.62 kilograms of high density polyethylene Soltex T60 2000 . The components were initially brought together at 380 C. for 30 seconds in a No. 3 Banbury mixer. The temperature rose to 940G. and mixing continued for 2 minutes. With continued mixing for 3 minutes the temperature increased to 1500C. After 25 minutes of mixing the temperature rose to 1780C. The highly dispersed masterbatch formed was transferred to a 1.52 metre batch off mill, blended and then cut into slabs measuring about 61 cm x 1.52 m x 1.91 cm. The slabs were dipped in a dispersion of zinc stearate to enable easy separation of the slabs.The following ingredients were added in the order specified to the Banbury mixer the rotor adjusted to 70 rpm 1. No. 1 Crepe 8960 grams 2. Natysn 2200 17024 grams 3. Bromobutyl X 2 4480 grams HDPE Masterbatch prepared as above 17920 grams 5. Sartomer 350 448 grams 6. 410 Silicone Gum 448 grams 7. Cab O Sil MS 7 8960 grams 8. Polyethylene 617 896 grams 9. Vanwax H 448 grams 10. Petrolatum B 448 grams 11. Zinc Stearate 224 grams 12. Stearic Acid 224 grams 13. Antioxidant 425 224 grams 14. Nevtac 100 Resin 448 grams The initial temperature was 490C. which then rose to 660C..Over the next 4 3 4 minutes the temperature rose to 1500C.with constant mixing and agitation in the Banbury mixer.The mix was then removed from the Banbury mixer and allowed to cool.The peroxide curing agent was added just prior to the extrusion step when the curing mix was extruded into a long rod having an approximate diameter of 3.175 mm to 19.05 mm and then cut into plugs having a thickness of 3.175 mm to 19.05 mm or cut into smaller chips. These plugs or chips were then moulded in a rubber moulding press at 1670C to 1840C for 15 to 30 minutes. The end product had the following properties. Shore A Hardness 554 5 Specific Gravity 1.00 i .05 Cure 30 minutes at 1670C. Ash 14.6Z 2.0 Colour Amber transparent Tensile Strength .......... 209.14 kg cm2 Elongation ................ 625 Durometer A Hardness .......... 55 Specific Gravity ............... 1.01When tested in accordance with the U.S. Pharmacopeia XX, p.918, Elastomeric Closures for Injections, PhysicochemicalTest Procedure the results were Turbidity Nephelos .......... 2.0 pH ................. 5.7Q pH Change ..................... .62 I2ml .OlN .01These extraction test results indicate very low amounts of extractables, which should be quite acceptable for most pharmaceutical applications.Toxicity Tests USPXX, p. 917 Biological Toxicity test, gave excellent results for cytotoxicity using Mouse cells andHuman Blood Haemolysis test results. The finished moulded parts may include needle puncture indicators and other moulded in marks. The rubber parts had good tear strength so that needle punctures are generally confined to the actual area of penetration. Example IIAll the following ingredients were placed in a Banbury No 3 mixer having a 300 horsepower motor to make the uncured composition in a one step process GRAMS Natsyn 2200 17,252 No 1 Crepe 22,700 Bromobutyl X 2 4,540 Polyethylene T 60 2000, 4,540 Sartomer 350 454 410 Silicone Gum 454 HISIL 233 precipitated hydrated silica 0.022 micron particle size 9,o80 Polyethylene 617 908 Vanwax H 454 Petrolatum B 454 Vanfre AP 2 454 Nevtac 100 454 Wingstay L 113Once all the ingredients have been placed in the mixer the temperature is brought to 660C. After 45 seconds the temperature increased to 690C and after 2 minutes and 15 seconds the temperature was 94 C. Upon further mixing and ramming the temperature reached 1780C after 7 minutes. After 8 minutes of mixing the temperature reached 192 OC, Thus, the one step process is run to a somewhat higher temperature than that reached with the two step process of Example I.The final mixed product is formed into slabs and cooled as with in the second step of Example I. When needed, the one step product was fed to the extruder. At the warm up mill of the extruder the Varox liquid peroxide catalyst 454 grams was added. Product made from the plugs and chips produced by the one step process, was found to possess all of the significant features of the product of Example I.
