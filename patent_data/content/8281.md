# Exhaust system for a pulsating heat source.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an exhaust system distinguished by a low content of passing through impurities and a low sound level and being intended for a pulsating heat source, especially an internal combustion engine. The exhaust gases from the different cylinders in such an engine 1 are led through equally long partial pipes 9 in a manifold 10 to a junction of said partial pipes, where an exhaust pipe 12 uniform in wall thick ness and in diameter is attached. Said exhaust pipe is termi nated by an annular gable 13 . In a hole in said gable an inner pipe 14 is gas tightly inserted into the exhaust pipe 12 . The length of the parts of the exhaust system is tuned so that three kinds of standing waves arise. One of said waves is a negative pressure wave, beginning at about the bottom dead centre of a piston 5 in the engine 1 and terminating at the in side end 15 of the inner pipe 14 , and is so adapted that nodes appear at both the ends. Another wave is a gas velocity wave beginning at the exhaust valves 4 and terminating at the annular gable 13 and is so adapted that loops appear at both the ends. These two waves concern the exhaust gases. A third standing wave relates to the loudness level and is adapted to operate between the exhaust valve 4 and said gable 13 , having a node at the in side end 15 of the inner pipe 14 .
