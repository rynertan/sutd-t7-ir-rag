# System for heat recovery for combustion machine including compressor.

## Abstract
System for waste heat recovery, comprising a combus tion machine 2,3 with a compressor 4 for the combustion air 30 and means 7 like a heat exchanger 13 and or a recirculation duct 14 , to transfer heat, contained in the com bustion gases 37,38,39 after their expansion in the machine 3 , to the combustion air flow 33 before its entry into the compressor 4 . Water 8,8 is introduced into the to be heated combustion air flow 30,33 cooling it by its evapora tion, and the vapor is partially condensed again in a cooler 6 fitted in the compressed flow 34 after leaving the compres sor 4 . The condensation can take place at higher tempera ture, thus the system acts as heat pump for the waste heat. The compressed air flow 35 enters extra cooled into the combustion chamber 2 which provides an additional advan tage. For the compressor 4 , combustion chamber 2 and turbine 3 a normal gas turbine may be used.
