# Multiple connector hood for interconnections to printed circuit boards.

## Abstract
A cable connection hood 1 for housing a single or multiple socket connector, has a pair of mating wall sections 2, 3 that have abutting flanges 8 and contain spacer blocks C, 23 in various predetermined reconfigurable patterns. A wall section 2,3 has a support flange 11 spaced from an inwardly directed lip 9 along the front thereon, with the spacer blocks C, 23 fitting between the support flange 11 and the lip 9 . The spacer blocks C, 23 comprise center portion blocks and end blocks and have means 25, 26, 27 thereon for securement within the mated wall sections. The connector hood 1 is usable with either round or flat cables and has means for preventing dislocation of socket connec tors, contained therein, from card edge connectors during vibrations or shocks.
