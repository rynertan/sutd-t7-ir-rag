## Description
PROCESS FOR SULFONES The oxidation of cephalosporin and penicillin compounds to the corresponding sulfoxides has been known for some time. The oxidation is carried out with hydrogen peroxide or a peracid, for example, perbenzoic acid, peracetic acid, or m chloroperbenzoic acid. Little has been reported on the cephalosporin sulfones, i.e., cephalosporins fully oxidized in the l position. Chauvetteet al. in U.S. Patent 3,536,698 teach the preparation of cephalosporin sulfones with excess amounts of the peracids employed to make the corresponding sulfoxides. This invention relates to a process for the preparation of penicillin and cephalosporin sulfones. In particular, it relates to a process for the oxida tion of penicillins and cephalosporins to the corre sponding sulfones with potassium hydrogen persulfate at controlled pH. Potassium hydrogen persulfate, also known as potassium peroxymonosulfate, is described by Kennedy et al., J. Org. Chem., 25, 1901 1960 . The oxidation of organic sulfides to sulfones, for example, thio anisole to methyl phenyl sulfone, with potassium hydrogen persulfate is described by E. M. Trost et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 22, 1287 1981 . The process of this invention comprises the oxidation of cephalosporin and penicillin compounds 4 or the sulfoxides thereof to the corresponding sul fones. The process is illustrated by the following partial structural formulas. EMI2.1 According. to the invention, a compound represented by the following structural formula 1EMI2.2 n is 0 or 1 R1 is hydroxy or acetoxy M is an alkali metal cation and R is the residue of the acyl groupRCO as defined hereinafter is reacted in an aqueous medium maintained at a pH between about 4 and about 6.5 with potassium hydrogen persulfate to provide the corresponding sulfone represented by the following structural formula 2.EMI2.3 wherein R and Y have the same meanings as defined above and M is hydrogen or an alkali metal cation. The process is preferably carried out at a temperature between about OOC. and about 450C, more preferably at a temperature between about 150C. and about 350C. The reaction is carried out in an aqueous medium which may comprise a water miscible organic solvent such as a lower alcohol, for example, methyl alcohol or ethyl alcohol, at a pH of between about 4 0 and about 6.5. When the pH of the reaction medium is lower than about pH 4.0, penicillin and cephalosporin free acids are present and can precipitate from the aqueous medium. At a pH above about 6.5 the oxidant decomposes with loss of oxygen. Further, at a pH above about pH 7.0 it has been found that the 7 position side chain of the cephalosporin undergoes epimerization.For example, at a pH between about 7.5 and 8.0 the 75 acylaminocephalosporin is epimerized to a mixture of the 7a acylaminocephalosporin and the 7ss acylamino cephalosporin. This mixture of epimers which occurs during the oxidation at the higher pH renders the separation and crystallization of the sulfone product difficult. In carrying out the oxidation of a compound represented by the formula 1 without controlling the pH, the acidity of the reaction mixture rapidly decreases to a pH at which the penicillin or cephalosporin exists as the free acid. The latter precipitates from the aqueous medium thus preventing the desired oxidation. Under the controlled pH conditions of the process described herein, the penicillin and cephalosporin compounds remain in solution for sulfone formation without allowing epimerization to occur. The term R in the formula 1 represents hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, the 4 formylbutyl group OCH CH2 3 , the 4 carboxybutyl group HOOC CH2 3 or the protected 4 carboxy 4 aminobutyl group represented by the formulaEMI4.1 wherein R is a protected amino group or R is group represented by the formulaEMI4.2 wherein R is thienyl, furyl, tetrazolyl, phenyl, or a substituted phenyl group represented by the formulaEMI4.3 wherein a and a independently are hydrogen,C1 C4 alkyl, halo, protected amino, protected aminomethyl, carboxy, carboxymethyl, hydroxy, or C1 C4 alkoxy and Q is hydrogen, protected amino, hydroxy, or carboxy or R is a phenyl group or a substituted phenyl group represented by the formulaEMI5.1 wherein a and a have the same meanings as defined hereinabove or R is a phenoxymethyl group represented by the formulaEMI5.2 wherein a and a are as defined above or R is an alkoxy or substituted alkoxy group represented by the formula R O wherein R is C1 C5 alkyl, C3 C6 cycloalkyl, adamantyl, benzyl, benzyl substituted by C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, or halo diphenyl methyl, or diphenylmethyl substituted by C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, or halo. As used herein, the term C1 C4 alkyl refers to methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl, n butyl, secbutyl, and t butyl C1 C4 alkoxy refers to methoxy, ethoxy, iso propoxy, t butoxy, n butoxy, and like lower alkyl ether radicals and halo refers to fluoro, chloro, or bromo. The term protected amino refers to a substi tuted amino group wherein the substituent is an art recognized protecting group readily removable to provide the free primary amino group. Examples of such groups include the alkoxycarbonyl and substituted alkoxycarbonyl protecting groups such as ethoxycarbonyl, t butyloxycarbonyl, trichloroethoxycarbonyl, cyclopentyloxycarbonyl, adamantyloxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, diphenylmethoxycarbonyl, and the like the acyl and substituted acyl groups such as acetyl, chloroacetyl, trifluoroacetyl, benzoyl, and halobenzoyl, eg. chlorobenzoyl and trityl and like protecting groups. The sulfone compounds represented by the formula 1 wherein R is HOOCCH R CH2t3 are derivatives of cephalosporin C R1 acetoxy and desacetylcephalosporin C R1 OR . During the process of the invention, the amino group of the a aminoadipoyl side chain is protected to prevent its oxidation by the persulfate. In addition to the amino protecting groups described above, the amino protecting group can be one of the groups commonly employed to protect the amino group of cephalosporin C or used as a derivative of the natural product for ease in isolation or crystallization.Since cephalosporin C itself, by its N deacylation to 7 aminocephalosporanic acid, is used as a starting material for many semi synthetic cephalosporin antibiotics, the nature of the amino protected group R is not critical. Examples of R groups are phthalimido, benzamido, chlorobenzamido, dichlorobenzamido, bromobenzamido, 2 carboxy tetrachlorobenzamido, acetamido, chloroacetamido, propionamido, and phenylacetamido. In the process of this invention, the cephalosporin or penicillin in free carboxylic acid form is suspended in the aqueous medium and the pH of the suspension or slurry is adjusted to between about 4 and about 6.5 by the addition of an alkali metal carbonate, bicarbonate, or hydroxide. At this pH, the carboxylic acid is converted to the soluble salt corresponding to the alkali metal employed. A solution of potassium hydrogen persulfate in water is then added to the solution of the cephalosporin or penicillin salt.In order to control the pH in the desired range, a solution of a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, carbonate, or bicarbonate, for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or sodium bicarbonate is added dropwise along with the persulf ate. 2N Sodium hydroxide solution is a desirable concentration of the alkali metal hydroxide for controlling the pH. Other bases which are suitably used to control pH in the process are sodium perborate monohydrate, tetrasodium phosphate, and diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid DTPA . Alternatively, the acidic aqueous solution of the persulfate is treated with an alkali metal hydroxide, for example potassium hydroxide, to adjust the .pH of the oxidant solution to about 5.0. To avoid decomposition of the oxidant which occurs at about pH 5 and above, the pH adjustment is carried out at ice bath temperature and the buffered oxidant solution is used promptly after preparation. This solution of the buffered oxidant is then added to the solution of the cephalosporin or penicillin salt adjusted in pH as described above. During the addition of the buffered oxidant solution, adequate control of the pH of the oxidation reaction can be achieved by periodic addition of a 5 aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate. A preferred source of the persulfate oxidant is the triple salt mixture comprising 2 moles of potassium monopersulfate potassium hydrogen persulfate, KHSO5 , 1 mole of potassium hydrogen sulfate, and 1 mole of potassium sulfate. This mixture is commercially available under the trade name OZONES monopersulfate compound from E. I. duPont de Nemours andCompany. In the process of this invention, a cephalosporin or penicillin sulfoxide represented by the structural formula 1 wherein n is 1 is also converted to the corresponding sulfone. The sulfoxidecan have either the a or the ss configuration. When a cephalosporin or penicillin in the unoxidized form sulfide form, formula I, n 0 is employed in the process, the sulfide form is apparently first oxidized to the sulfoxide and the latter is then further oxidized to the sulfone. In contrast to the prior methods for preparing sulfones which employ peracids such as perbenzoic acid, peracetic acid, or m chloroperbenzoic acid, the conversion of the sulfoxide form to the sulfone occurs rapidly with ease in the process of this invention. In an example of the process of this invention. 7ss phenylacetylaminocephalosporanic acid is suspended in water and the solution is treated with 2N sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH to between about 5.5 and about 6.0. When the pH is adjusted, a solution of the salt form, sodium 7ss phenylacetylaminocephalo sporanate, is obtained. To the solution is added an aqueous solution containing a 3 molar excess of potassium hydrogen per sulfate monopersulfate compound . The solution of the oxidant is added dropwise while at the same time a 2N solution of sodium hydroxide is also added dropwise to maintain the pH of the oxidation mixture between about 5.5 and about 6.2. When all the oxidant has been added, the reaction mixture is tested for the presence of excess oxidant, for example, with starch KI paper.Any excess oxidant is destroyed by adding a reducing agent such as sodium bisulfite to the reaction mixture. The sulfone product is recovered from the reaction mixture by the addition of a water immiscible organic solvent such as ethyl acetate followed by adjustment of the pH of the mixture to about pH 2.0.The reaction mixture can be acidified with a mineral acid, for example, hydrochloric acid. The sulfone product is extracted into the organic solvent which is separated, washed, dried, and evaporated to provide the product. Alternatively, with some sulfone products provided by the process of this invention, the organic phase following washing and drying is concentrated to a small volume and the concentrate is diluted with a solvent such as diethyl ether or methylene chloride to precipitate the crystalline sulfone. The following are illustrative of the cephalosporin sulfones provided by the process of this invention 7 formamidocephalosporanic acid l,l dioxide, 7 acetamidocephalosporanic acid l,l dioxide, 7 adipamidocephalosporanic acid l,l dioxide, 7 adipamidodesacetylcephalosporanic acid 1,1dioxide, 7 alpha phthalimidoadipamido cephalosporanic acid 1,1 dioxide, 7 phenylacetamidocephalosporanic acid 1,1dioxide, 7 phenoxyacetamidocephalosporanic acid 1,1dioxide, 7 2 thienyl acetamidocephalosporanic acid 1,1 dioxide, 7 tetrazolylacetamidocephalosporanic acid l,l dioxide, 7 benzamidocephalosporanic acid l,l dioxide, 7 4 methylbenzamido cephalosporanic acid l,l dioxide, 7 D a t butyloxycarbamido phenylacetamido cephalosporanic acid l,l dioxide, 7 D mandelamidocephalosporanic acid 1,1dioxide, 7 D malonamidocephalosporanic acid 1,1dioxide, 7 ethoxycarbonylaminocephalosporanic acid l,l dioxide, 7 t butyloxycarbonylaminocephalosporanic acid l,l dioxide, 7 t butyloxycarbonylaminodesacetylcephalospor anic acid l,l dioxide, 7 cyclopentyloxycarbonylaminocephalosporanic acid l,l dioxide, 7 adamantyloxycarbonylaminocephalosporanic acid l,l dioxide, 7 benzyloxycarbamidocephalosporanic acid 1,1dioxide, 7 4 chlorobenzyloxycarbami do cephalosporanic acid l,l dioxide, and 7 diphenylmethoxycarbamidocephalosporanic acid l,l dioxide. In carrying out the process of this invention as described hereinabove, with a compound of the formula 1 wherein R1 is hydroxy, the formation of the corresponding lactone, i.e. the intramolecular ester form with the hydroxymethyl group and the carboxy group in the 4 position, can occur particularly during the acidification of the reaction mixture containing the sulfone product. Accordingly, it is desirable to carry out the isolation of the sulfone as rapidly as possible. Alternatively, the extraction of the acidified reaction mixture can be carried out with a waterimmiscible organic solvent such as ethyl acetate containing an esterification reagent such as diphenyl diazomethane. The free carboxylic acid sulfone is thus converted to the corresponding ester which prevents lactone formation. Lactone formation can also be avoided by isolating the sulfone in the salt form. In carrying out the process with a cephalosporin compound the preferred pH is between about 5.0 and about 6.5. In a further example of the process, potassium 6ss phenoxyacetamidopenicillanate is dissolved in water and cooled to ice bath temperature. A solution of potassium hydrogen persulfate containing at least a 3 molar excess and adjusted to pH 5.6 is added dropwise with stirring to the cold penicillin salt solution.The pH of the oxidation mixture is maintained at between about 4.0 to about 5.0 by the periodic addition of an aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate. After all of the oxidant is added, the reaction mixture is allowed to stir at room temperature to insure complete sulfone formation. Excess persulfate is destroyed by the addition of a reducing agent such as sodium bisulfite.The penicillin sulfone product is isolated in either of two ways. In one, the reaction mixture is acidified to pH 2 to 2.5 with an acid such as hydrochloric acid.Some of the penicillin sulfones will precipitate as the free acids directly from the aqueous acidified reaction mixture, particularly when the volume of the reaction mixture is kept low. Alternatively, the reaction mixture prior to acidification is layered with a water immiscible organic solvent in which the penicillin sulfone is voluble. The mixture is then acidified to about pH 2.0 to 2.5 and the sulfone free acid is extracted into the organic solvent. The extract is separated, washed, dried and evaporated to provide the product. Preferably, in the oxidation of a penicillin or a sulfoxide thereof the pH is controlled between about 4.0 and about 5.5. The following are examples of penicillin sulfones provided by the process of this invention 6 formamidopenicillanic acid l,l dioxide, 6 acetamidopenicillanic acid 1,l dioxide, 6 adipamidopenicillanic acid l,l dioxide penicillin N sulfone , 6 phenylacetamidopenicillanic acid 1,1dioxide penicillin G sulfone , 6 phenoxyacetamidopenicillanic acid 1,1dioxide penicillin V sulfone , 6 4 methylbenzamido penicillanic acid 1,1dioxide, 6 benzamidopenicillanic acid 1,1 dioxide, 6 D phenylglycylaminopenicillanic acid 1,1dioxide ampicillin sulfone , 6 D malonamidopenicillanic acid l,l dioxide carbenacillin sulfone , 6 D mandelamidopenicillanic acid l,l dioxide, 6 D 2 carboxy 2 2 thienyl acetamido peni cillanic acid l,l dioxide, 6 t butyloxycarbamidopenicillanic acid l,l dioxide, 6 ethoxycarbamidopenicillanic acid l,l dioxide, 6 adamantyloxycarbamidopenicillanic acid l,l dioxidej 6 cyclopentyloxycarbamidopenicillanic acid l,l dioxide, 6 benzyloxycarbamidopenicillanic acid 1,1dioxide, and 6 diphenylmethoxycarbamidopenicillanic acid l,l dioxide. The cephalosporin sulfones provided by the process of this invention are useful starting materials in a process for preparing l oxa ss lactam antibiotics.The conversion of these sulfone products to the l oxa antibiotic compounds is a multi step process comprising the epimerization of the 7ss acylaminocephalosporin sulfone to the corresponding 7a acylamino sulfone deacetylation formula 1 , R1 acetoxy to the 7aacylamino 3 hydroxymethyl sulfone electrolysis of the epimeric 3 hydroxymethyl sulfone to a 3a acylamino azetidin 2 one 4 sulfinic acid and the cyclization of the azetidinone sulfinic acid to a 3 methyl l oxa B lactam and the isomeric 3 exomethylene l oxa compound. The foregoing sequence of reactions employing the cephalosporin sulfones obtained by the process of this invention is illustrated in the following reaction scheme. EMI15.1 EMI16.1 The epimerization of the sulfone free acid to the 7a acylamino sulfone is preferably carried out in an aqueous medium as follows. A slurry of the sulfone free acid in water is treated with an aqueous solution containing at least an equimolar amount of sodium acetate. An aqueous solution of piperazine is thenadded dropwise until the pH of the solution is adjusted to between about 9.5 to about 10 With the pH adjusted, the epimerization mixture is stirred for about 15 minutes and the epimer is recovered as follows. A water insoluble organic solvent such as an ester, for example, ethyl acetate, is added to the epimerization solution which is then acidified to a pH of about 2.0. The epimeric 7a acylamino sulfone free acid is then extracted with the organic solvent. The epimeric sulfone is deacylated with acetyl esterase to provide the epimeric 3 hydroxymethylcephalosporin sulfone. The deacetylation is preferably carried out with the esterase immobilized on a modified silica gel. The immobilization of the acetyl esterase is carried out as follows. Silica gel of 70 230 mesh and 62 200 mp particle size is cleaved by heating a slrry of the silica in aqueous 10 nitric acid at a temperature of about 800C. for 3 hours. After cooling, the silica is washed thoroughly with water. The cleaned silica gel is then slurried in 10 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane and the slurry deaerated under vacuum. The pH of the slurry is adjusted to from about 3 to about 4 with dilute hydrochloric acid and the acidified slurry is heated at 800C. for about 3 hours with periodic agitation. The modified silica is filtered, washed with water, and dried for about 16 hours at 1050C. The dry silica is then slurried with aqueous 3 glutaraldehyde buffered with pH 7 phosphate buffer 5 10 vol. wt. of silica .This slurry is periodically agitated for 3 hours and is then washed with water and pH 7 citrate buffer. This modified silica gel can then be packed into a column or, alternatively, in another suitable vessel and a neutral aqueous solution of the acetyl esterase is added to the resin and allowed to interact for about 20 hours. The silica enzyme is then transferred to a glass column and washed with pH 7 citrate buffer. The cephalosporin sulfone represented by formula 1 R1 is acetoxy is dissolved in 0.2 M aqueous sodium citrate and the pH of the solution adjusted to 7 with 1N sodium hydroxide. The solution is then passed over the immobilized enzyme in the column and the effluent collected. Ethyl acetate is added to the effluent and the mixture is chilled to OOC. The pH of the cold aqueous organic mixture is adjusted to about 2.5 with hydrochloric acid and the ethyl acetate layer is separated. The acidified aqueous phase is further extracted with ethyl acetate and all extracts are combined and washed with acidified brine and then dried. The 3 hydroxymethyl cephalosporin sulfone is recovered from the ethyl acetate by evaporation.Alternatively, the epimeric desacetylcephalosporin sulfone can be esterified at this stage. For example, the washed and dried ethyl acetate extract of the effluent is concentrated under reduced pressure and the concentrate treated with the esterifying reagent, for example, diphenyldiazomethane, to form the desired ester, for example, the diphenylmethyl ester. The esterified 7a acylamino 3 hydroxymethylcephalosporin sulfone is then reduced at the cathode of an electrolysis cell comprising a mercury pool cathode, a platinum anode, and a cationic resin bridge. Suitable electrolytes are, for example, sodium perchlorate, lithium chloride, or sodium acetate. The anolyte is preferably phosphate buffer, pH 2.7. The reduction is carried out preferably at a temperature between about 100C. and about 100C. at a reduction potential between about 1.9 v. and about 1.9 o. The 3 hydroxymethyl sulfone ester is dissolved in methyl alcohol containing a proton source such as acetic acid and an electrolyte salt such as sodium acetate is added to the solution until a concentration of 0.1N with respect to the electrolyte is achieved.The solution is then added to the cathode compartment of the electrolysis cell which is then flushed with argon to remove oxygen. The electrolysis is then carried out either at constant potential or at constant current. The progress of the electrolysis can be monitored by use of analytical HPLC carried out on an aliquot of the reduction mixture. The above procedures are described in more detail in copending applications reference Nos. X 5017, X 5510, X 4998 of even date herewith. Following the electrolysis, the reduction product mixture is extracted in the cold with a waterimmiscible organic solvent, preferably ethyl acetate.The 3 epiazetidin 2 one 4 sulfinic acid formula 5 above can be purified by HPLC. The azetidinone sulfinic acid, 5, is then cyclized to an isomeric mixture of the 3 exomethylene and corresponding 3 methyl I oxa ss lactam compound represented by formula 6 in the above reaction scheme.The cyclizatinn is carried out according to the process described in co pendina application reference o. X 521 of even date herewith. According to the described process, the azetidinone sulfinic acid is reacted at a temperature between about 250C. and about OOC. with between about 1 and about 2.5 mole equivalents of lead tetraacetate in a dipolar äprotic solvent such as sulfur dioxide and preferably in the presence of copper II ion. The reaction proceeds rapidly on a mole. scale, i.e. in an hour or less. The reaction proceeds rapidly on a mole scale, i.e. in an hour or less.The reaction product mixture is then diluted with a water immiscible organic solvent such as ethyl acetate and the mixture is washed with brine and pE 7 phosphate buffer. The organic solvent containing the products is separated and washed ether before drying. Evaporation of the solvent provides the isomeric mixture of products which can be separated on reverse phase C18 silica gel, 5C. The l oxa ss lactam cyclized products, 6, obtained with the cephalosporin sulfones of this invention as described hereinabove are themselves useful intermediates for the preparation of known l oxa B lactam antibacterial compounds. For example, the 7a acylamino 3 methyl or 3 exomethylene carboxylic acid in esterified form can be methoxylated in the 7position with conversion of the 7 epi side chain to the natural or 7ss configuration. The methoxylation is carried out according to the procedure described byNarisada et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,138,486 The methoxylated product is a 7S acylamino 7a methoxy substituted l oxa 8 lactam ester.The 7a methoxylated 3 exomethylene 1 oxa ss lactam compounds obtained in the above described methoxylation are useful as intermediates in the preparation of 3 alkoxy and 3 halo substituted compounds. For example, the 75 acylamino 7a methoxy 3 exomethylene ester is reacted with ozone to form the 3 hydroxy ester and the latter can be reacted with diazomethane to form the corresponding 3 methoxy compound. Alternatively, the 3 hydroxy compound can be reacted with phosphorus trichloride and dimethylformamide to form the 3 chloro ester.Following these reactions at the 3 position, the 7 position side chain can be removed by known N deacylation procedures and the 7 amino 3 substituted l oxa B lactam nucleus reacylated with a derivative of the appropriate carboxylic acid to provide the desired compound in esterified form. Following the acylation, any amino or carboxy protecting groups can be removed to provide the desired antibacterial compound in the free acid form.The N deacylation can be achieved by either of two known methods. For example, when in the formula 1 R is an alkoxy or substituted alkoxy group, the 7 position side chain is an alkoxycarbamido group, for example ethoxycarbamido, or a substituted alkoxy group, for example benzyloxycarbamido. Treatment of the cyclized product with trifluoroacetic acid effects the removal of the alkoxycarbonyl or substituted alkoxycarbonyl side chain and provides the 7 amino deacylation product.The benzyloxycarbonyl and substituted benzyloxycarbonyl and like side chains can also be removed by catalytic hydrogenolysis over 5 Pd C. Alternatively, when the side chain in the cyclized product is an acylamino group, for example phenylacetylamino, the cyclized product is reacted with phosphorus pentachloride in an inert halogenated hydrocarbon solvent such as di or trichloroethane to provide the imino chloride of the 7 position amido group. The imino chloride is converted to an imino ether by treating the imino chloride with a lower alcohol or a benzyl alcohol, and the imino ether upon hydrolysis provides the 7 amino 3 substituted l oxa B lactam nucleus compound. The cephalosporin sulfones provided by the process of this invention are also useful in the preparation of 7B 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 methoxy iminoacetamidoi cephalosporanic acid 1,1 dioxide having antibiotic properties. W. Dürckheimer in RecentAdvances in the Chemistry of B Lactam Antibiotics ,Special Publication No. 38, G. I. Gregory, Ed., The Royal Soc. of Chem., Burlington House, London, 1980,Chapter 4. 7 Aminocephalosporanic acid l,l dioxide in esterified form is obtained by the N deacylation procedures described hereinabove, and is reacylated with an active derivative of 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2methoxyiminoacetic acid to provide, following deesterification, the antibiotic compound. The penicillin sulfones provided by the process of this invention, like other penicillin sulfones, are useful to a greater or lesser degree in inhibiting ss lactamase enzymes produced by microorganisms.As such they can be employed in assays for determining the amount of B lactam antibiotics present in a sample by preventing their enzymatic destruction. The penicillin sulfones may also be used as adjuncts to ss lactam antibiottics by retarding antibiotic destruction during therapy. The following examples further illustrate the process of this invention. Example 1 7ss 4 Methylbenzamido cephalosporanic acid l,l dioxide To a slurry of 156 g. of 78 4 methylbenzamido cephalosporanic acid in 400 ml. of water were added 660 ml. of 5 sodium bicarbonate and 1 ml. of Anti Foam A.The final pH of the solution was 5.9. A solution of 592 g. of potassium hydrogen persulfate pH 2.0 in 2.2 liters of water was treated with 324 ml. of 4N potassium hydroxide to adjust the pH of the oxidant solution to 4.9. The oxidant solution was added to the solution of the cephalosporin at room temperature. During the addition, 5 sodium bicarbonate was added from time to time to maintain the pH of the reaction mixture between 5.2 and 5.9. During the addition of the oxidant solution which took about 45 min., the temperature of the reaction mixture rose to 320C. The reaction mixture was stirred for two hours after which time the thin layer chromatogram run with Åa small aliquot showed only product in the mixture. The excess potassium hydrogen persulfate was destroyed by the addition of sodium bisulfite. The pH of the reaction mixture was 1.8 and the sulfone product began to gum out of solution. The reaction mixture was extracted with 3 1. of ethyl acetate, the extract washed with water, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated in a rotary evaporator. The residue of crude product was dissolved in 300 ml. of methylene chloride containing 200 ml. of ethyl acetate.The product, 75 4 methylbenzamido cephalosporanic acid l,l dioxide, crystallized from solution. There were obtained 83.3 g., 49.3 yield, of first crop material. Example 2 The above oxidation was repeated on a larger scale using 313.5 g. of the same starting material and with the pH maintained between 5.5 and 5.9. There were obtained 206.4 g. of first crop sulfone and 34.9 g. of second crop sulfone for a combined yield of 241.3 g. 76.9 Example 3 7ss Phenylacetamidocephalosporanic acid l,l dioxide A suspension of 8.128 g. of 75 phenylaceta midocephalosporanic acid in 30 ml. of water was treated with enough 2N sodium hydroxide until the pH was adjusted to between 5.5 and 6.2 and a solution obtained.A solution of 29.6 g. of potassium hydrogen persulfate in 110 ml. of water was added dropwise to the cephalosporin solution, while at the same time 2N sodium hydroxide was added dropwise to maintain the pH of the mixture between 5.5 and 6.2. Addition required 45 min.and the mixture was stirred for one hour post addition.Sodium bisulfite solid was then added to destroy excess oxidant. Ethyl acetate 50 ml. was added and the pH of the mixture was adjusted to about 2.0 with concentrated hydrochloric acid. The ethyl acetate extract was separated and the mixture extracted two more times with fresh 50 ml. portions of ethyl acetate. The extracts were combined, washed with water, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by evaporation to a volume of about 50 ml. The concentrate was diluted with an equal volume of diethyl ether and allowed to stand in the refrigerator. The product crystallized and was filtered. There were obtained 2.414 g. of first crop material and 0.925 g. of second crop product. The combined crops represented a 39.5 yield of sulfone product.

Example 5 7ss Benzyloxyzarbamidocephalosporanic acid 1,1 dioxide A suspension of 40.64 g. 0.1M of 7ss benzyloxycarbamidocephalosporanic acid in 150 ml. of water was treated with about 55 ml. of 2N sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH of about 5.5 to 6.2. At this pH the cephalosporanic acid went into solution. The solution was treated by dropwise addition with a solution of 148 g. of potassium hydrogen persulfate in 550 ml. of water. Simultaneously, 2N sodium hydroxide was added dropwise to maintain the pH of the oxidation mixture at about 5.5 to 6.2. After the additions were complete the mixture was stirred for one hour. The mixture was positive.for excess oxidant KI starch paper and about 1.5 g. of sodium bisulfite were added to destroy the excess. Ethyl acetate ca. 200 ml. was added to the mixture and the pH was adjusted to 2.0 with concentrated hydrochloric acid. The ethyl acetate was separated and the acidified mixture was extracted twice again with ethyl acetate. The extracts were combined, washed with water, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated to dryness. The residue of sulfone product was dissolved in 50 ml. of a 1 1, v v, mixture of methylene chloride and diethyl ether and the solution was cooled in the refrigerator for 24 hours. When the product failed to crystallize, the solution was evaporated to dryness and the residue of the sulfone product was dissolved in a 1 2, v v, mixture of ethyl acetate and diethyl ether. The solution was allowed to stand in the refrigerator for several days for crystallization to occur. There were obtained 6.336 g. of the white crystalline sulfone product. Example 6Disodium 7ss t4 2t4 dichlorobenzamido 4 carboxyvaler amido cephalosporanate l,l dioxide To a solution of 100 g. 0.16 mole of the disodium salt of 78 4 2,4 dichlorobenzamido 4 carboxyvaleramido cephalosporanic acid in 400 ml. of water was added dropwise with stirring a solution of 194 g. of potassium hydrogen persulfate 2KHSO5JKESO4sK2SO4 in 800 ml. of water. The pH of the persulfate solution was adjusted to 2.4 with tN sodium hydroxide prior to addition. As the persulfate solution was added, the pH of the reaction mixture was maintained at about 5.7 by the dropwise addition of a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate.The formation of the sulfone product was monitored by reverse phase C18 silica HPLC using 28 acetonitrile 0.5 acetic acid water. After the reaction was. complete 1 hr. 50 min. , 16.6 g. of sodium bisulfite were added to the reaction mixture to reduce excess oxidant.
