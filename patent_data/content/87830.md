# High pressure discharge lamp.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a high pressure discharge lamp comprising a discharge vessel 3 enclosing a discharge space 3b and provided with two main electrodes 4 . Each of the main electrodes is connected to a lead through element 40 which is enclosed with an intermediate space 10 by a closing part 30 and is connected thereto in a gas tight manner by means of a sealing joint 9 . According to the invention, the lead through element is provided with a protuberance 41 reaching as far as the closing part and being present around the whole periphery of the lead through element. In this manner, a screening of the sealing joint from the discharge space is obtained.
