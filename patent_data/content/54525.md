# Ejector device.

## Abstract
The present invention relates shortly to an ejector device having an adjustment characteristic which is stepless vari able in dependence of the negative pressure generated by the ejector device. Said ejector device comprises a portion 16 for connection with a source of positive pressure delivering the work pressure to the ejector device 1 giving rise to the ejector action and a portion 2 having connection 18 for the member which is intended to use the negative pressure created by ejector device 11 . Said two portions 16, 2 of the ejector device 1 are stepless movable in relation to each other and in the space therebetween there is an adjustment plate 13 for controlling the suction action obtained by the ejector device 1 . The outlet slit 17 of the ejector device 1 is located between the plate 13 and the portion intended for connection with the positive pressure source. The adjustment plate 13 is connected to a stem 10 which is movable in relation to the portion 2 for connection with the negative pressure member but which is fixed in relation to the portion 16 to which the positive pressure source is connected.
