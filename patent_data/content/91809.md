# Stabilized mixtures of carbamate insecticides and synthetic pyrethroids.

## Abstract
A pesticidal mixture of a carbamate insecticide and a resolved or partially resolved synthetic pyrethroid is stabilized against racemization of the pyrethroid component by an effective amount, typically from 1 to 20 by weight, based on the carbamate, of one or more stabilizers selected from a anhydrides of specified aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids b specified aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates c formaldehyde d ninhydrin e fluorescamine or f mesityl oxide.
