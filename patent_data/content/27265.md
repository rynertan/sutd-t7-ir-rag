# Pacemaker with pulse width adjustment circuitry.

## Abstract
There is disclosed herein a cardiac pacemaker pulse generator utilizing digital circuitry for controlling the provi sion of cardiac stimulating pulses. The width of the pulses is increased as the battery voltage decreases to maintain the energy of the stimulation pulse. The pulse width of each pacemaker pulse is determined by comparing a reference signal to an incrementally increasing signal which is related to the battery voltage.
