# Checkerboard particularly for simultaneous use by more than two players for chess, draughts, and the like games.

## Abstract
The checkerboard comprises a regular octagon 20 di vided into four identical irregular pentagonal zones 20a d . The irregular pentagonal zones 20a d being bisected and the regular octagon 20 being resultantly divided into eight identi cal irregular quadrilaterals 41 48 . Each irregular quadrilateral 41 48 is then divided into sixteen small quadrilaterals deli mited by its perimeter. Two contiguous irregular quadrilaterals comprising thirty two small quadrilaterals, similarly to one half of the traditional chessboard.

## Description
CEECEERBOARD PARTICULARLY FOR SIMULTANEOUS USE BYMORE THAN TWO PLAYERS, FOR CHESS, DRAUGHTS, AND THELIKE GAMES This invention relates to a checkerboard, particularly for simultaneous use by more than two players, for chess, draughts, and the like games. Currently, commercially available traditional type checkerboards or chessboards usually comprise a flat element, including a square defined on the surface thereof. The square being divided into sixty four small, alternately coloured squares of equal size. A disadvantage of the traditional type of checkerboard, as currently, commercially available, resides in the fact that, at the most, only two players can sinnil taneously participate in a game. Resultantly, the number of possible game combinations ia very limited, and the playing of games such as coalition chess, i.e. teams of two players, cannot be played simultaneously. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a checkerboard, particularly for simultaneous use by more than two players, for chess, draughts, and the like games, which avails itself of a large number of possible game coibinations. It is a further object of the invention to provide a checkerboard which permits team games such as coalition chess, to be played thereon. A not unimportant aim of the invention is to provide a checkerboard which, whilst permitting an increased number of players to participate simultaneously and offering the possibility of a large number of game combinations, permits a chess game to be played substantially in conformity with traditional rules. This aim, and these and other objects which will become apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a checkerboard particularly for simultaneous use by more than two players for chess, draughts, and the like games, characterized in that it comprises a regular octagon divided into four irregular pentagonal zones, said zones being each further divided into thirty two small squares. A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying illus trative, non limitative drawings, where Figure 1 is a plan view of a checkerboard for simultaneous use by more than two players, according to the invention Figure 2 is a schematic plan view, showing geometrical details of a checkerboard according to the invention and Figure 3 is a schematic detail view of a quadrilateral portion of a checkerboard according to the invention. With reference to the heretofore cited drawing figures the checkerboard forming the subject matter of this patent comprises a flat element whereon the geom etric figure Fig.1 described herein below is reproduced, e.g. painted, which is based on an adaptation of the conventional checkerboard to an octagon. Let us consider, therefore, a regular octagon 20 Fig.2 and draw a perpendicular 21 24 from the midpoint of four alternate sides 31 34 , meeting at a common midpoint 100 the centre of the checkerboard . Thus, the octagon 20 will be divided into four identical irregular pentagonal zones 20a 20d By further drawing perpendiculars 25 28 from the midpoint of the remaining four interposed sides 35 38 to meet at the common midpoint 100 , each of the irregular pentagonal zones 20a d will be bisected and the regular octagon 20 will resultantly be divided into eight identical irregular quadrilaterals 41 48 t each bisected irregular pentagonal zone being divided into two such irregular quadrilaterals or tetragonal half zones. Let us take for each side of each of the irregular quadrilaterals Fig. 3 those three points 51 53, 54 56, 61 63, 64 66 which share the characteristic of being equidistant from one another and equidistant from the vertices of the side, thereby dividing each side into four equal parts. By joining the three points on each side 51 56 with the corresponding three points 61 66 on the opposing side, it may be seen that each quadrilateral is divided into sixteen small quadrilaterals defined within the irregular quadrilateral and being delimited by its perimeter. Two contiguous irregular quadrilaterals which together define one of said irregular pentagonal zones 20a d , comprise thirty two small quadrilaterals similarly to one half of a traditional chessboard. Each irregular pentagonal zone 20a d is defined by one side 35 38 of the regular octagon 20 such as th bottom side or base, whilst the two half sides contiguous thereto are defined by two segments whose apexes define the chessboard center or common midpoint 100 which may be likened to the centerline of a traditional chessboard. The one hundred and twenty eight small quadrilat erals which make up the whole chessboard are painted in two alternate colours, in conformity with known practices presently employed in the manufacture of chessboards, e.g. a pale colour and a dark one. Four vertices of the octagon are occupied by a dark square. The octagon sides which are adjacent, in a counterclockwise direction, to each dark corner square are defined by bottom sides of the chessboard and identify one zone, e.g. a red, green, white, and black zone each. The non bottom sides 31 34, lying substantially at 135O to their respective bottom sides 35 38 , are divided in half by their apothems 21 24 and are to be regarded as belonging to the zones identified by the two bottom sides contiguous thereto. Thus, each zone is delimited by one bottom aide, two half sides contiguous thereto, and the respective apothems of each of the contiguous sides, the two apothems converging toward the chessboard center. Advantageously, the zones are separated by a border of varying colours, e.g. of the same colour as the corre sponding zone, such as red, green, white, and black. The individual small quadrilaterals may be identified with coordinate numerals and characters. One character would identify each row of quadrilaterals extending from one bottom side, whilst one numeral would identify a row of quadrilaterals which extend from one of the half sides of each zone. In order to univocally identify the one hundred and twenty eight small squares which make up the chessboard, it would be possible to adopt eight characters and sixteen numerals, for example. With the chessboard according to this invention, chess games may be played in conformity with the traditional rules, as suitably modified to accommodate the changed geometric characteristics of the chess board. It should be noted that the possibility of accommodating four players at one chessboard affords a wide range of possible game combinations, which are not allowed by the traditional chessboard. It should be remarked, however, that it would be quite unadvisable to provide chesaboards for more than four players, because chess playing requires a high degree of concentration by the players and does not lend itself to accommodate too many persons at one time. Besides the traditional game of chess, it would be possible to play herein games of coalition chess, such as are not feasible with a chessboard for three, wherein the players meet in teams of two players each as defined, e.g. by drawing lots, at the start of the game. A variation of the game envisages that the teams may be alternated in the course of the same game, in conformity with either preset conventions or ones which are established each time according to the players own preferences and choices0 Considering that each player would be eliminated from playing by the time his her king is taken, a hypothetical game may be taken into consideration where the teams defined at the start of the game by drawing lots are left unaltered until the first player is eliminated. Thereupon, the teams may be changed at any time simply through an agreement between two players, which agreement may then be withdrawn, even unilaterally, to enter a different agreement or no agreement at all. In this case, the three players would carry on the game by playing against one anOther. It would be possible to make new alliances and then break them at any time, until a second player is eliminated from the game. From that time on, the game would continue in conformity with the standard rules of chess playing between the remaining two players.
