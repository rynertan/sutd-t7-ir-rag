# Display device.

## Abstract
A display device having a layer of liquid crystal 15 in a space enclosed by a rim 13 of sealing material between two supporting plates 1,2 . One supporting plate has a pattern of electrodes 3 to be driven individually with supply electrodes 4 and a number of external connection electrodes 5 . The supply electrodes and connection electrodes are connected to at least one non encapsulated IC crystal 9 provided on said supporting plate 1 . To provide protection for the IC crystals and to minimize the non effective display area the IC crystals are accommodated in recesses 10 in the rim of sealing mat erial of the display device.
