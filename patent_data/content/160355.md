# VIBRATORY WIRE STRAIN GAUGE ASSEMBLIES FOR UNDERWATER ATTACHMENT

## Abstract
A system comprises a pair of straps which are preferably hinged and are arranged to be clamped around a structure, for example, a tubular member to be strain gauged, and secured, for example, by means of a single swing bolt with a diver sized hand knob. Across these two straps are a number of, for example, two sets of four equally spaced arranged strain gauge assemblies, aligned along the longitudinal axis of the tubular member. Vibrating wire strain gauges are uniformly suspended by compression springs from a protective cover. Because such compression springs are relatively free to move laterally by small amounts, they do not significantly increase the axial stiffness of the strain gauge. The protective cover is attached to the two clamping straps by set bolts with diver sized hand knobs. When tightened the strain gauge will be pressed onto the member surface with the pre determined spring force. The protective cover is skirted by sealing, which, after installation will seal around the gauges offering complete mechanical protection plus protection from marine fouling.
