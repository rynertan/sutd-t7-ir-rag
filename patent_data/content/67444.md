# Electrically conductive organic polymeric material and process for production thereof.

## Abstract
An electrically conductive organic polymeric material comprising a an insoluble and infusible substrate with a polyacen type skeletal structure having a hydrogen carbon atomic ratio of from 0.60 to 0.15, said substrate being a heat treated product of an aromatic condensation polymer consisting of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, and b an electron donating doping agent, or an electron accepting doping agent, or both. The electrically conductive organic polymeric material can be produced by a process which comprises heattreating an aromatic condensation polymer consisting of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in a non oxidizing atmosphere by heating it to a temperature of 400 to 800 C to form a substrate having a hydrogen carbon atomic ratio of from 0.60 to 0.15, and then doping it with an electron donating doping agent, or an electron accepting doping agent, or a mixture of both. The electrically conductive organic polymeric materials exhibits excellent oxidation stability and has the electrical conductivity of a semiconduc tor or conductor.
