Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along the line 11 11 of Fig. 1. Fig. 3 is a sectional view taken along the line Ill Ill of Fig. 1. Fig. 4 is a horizontal sectional view of a front bumper unit showing a mounting construction of a bumper reinforcing member and a bumper cover according to one embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 5 is a sectional view taken along the lineV V of Fig. 4. Fig. 6 is a sectional view taken along the lineVI VI of Fig. 4. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Referring first to Figs. 1 3, a brief reference will be made to a conventional construction of a vehicle bumper unit which is here depicted as a front bumper by way of example. A front bumper unit generally denoted by reference numeral 1 comprises a bumper reinforcing member 2, an impact absorbing member 3 and a bumper cover 4. The bumper reinforcing member 2 is secured by means of bolts to bumper stays 6 which is fixed to side members 7 of a vehicle body. On the front side of the bumper reinforcing member 2 there is placed the impact absorbing member 3, and the surface of the impact absorbing is covered with the bumper cover 4. Upper and lower flange sections 4a and 4b of the bumper cover 4 are fastened by means of bolts to upper and lower sections 2a and 2b of the bumper reinforcing member 2, respectively. Thus, in a conventional vehicle bumper unit, the upper and lower flange sections 4a and 4b of the bumper cover 4 are integrally and rigidly fastened to the upper and lower sections 2a and 2b of the bumper reinforcing member 2. With such a conventional construction, the bumper cover 4 and the impact absorbing member 3 are deformed largely in the vertical direction when the bumper unit 1 absorbs impact energy in a light collision of the vehicle, so that the bumper cover 4 and the impact absorbing member 3 come into contact with a radiator grille 9 or other vehicle body members, thus to cause damages to these vehicle body members. Moreover, because of the large deformation of the bumper cover, there occur cracks in the fastening portions of the bumper cover 4, so that the bumper cover must be renewed always after a light collision. Furthermore, with such a conventional construction of a vehicle bumper, the bumper reinforcing member 2 must be installed on the vehicle body from the inside of a wheel housing portion 11 of a front fender 10, and therefore the installation of the bumper unit is very troublesome. SUMMARY OF THE INVENT ION It is an object of the present invention to provide an impact absorbing vehicle bumper unit which is arranged not to be deformed in the vertical direction in a collision of the vehicle so as to prevent damages to a radiator grille or other vehicle body members and to prevent occurrence of cracks in fastening portions between a bumper cover and a bumper reinforcing member of a bumper unit. It is another object of the present invention to provide an impact absorbing member which is arranged to be easily mounted on a vehicle body. An impact absorbing bumper unit according to the present invention comprises a bumper reinforcing member secured to a vehicle body, an impact absorbing member disposed in front of the bumper reinforcing member and a bumper cover which is arranged to cover the impact absorbing member. The bumper cover is fastened to the bumper reinforcing member by fastening means which is arranged to allow the bumper cover to slightly slide longitudinally of the vehicle toward the bumper reinforcing member when an external force caused by a collision of the vehicle is applied to the bumper unit. Preferably the fastening means comprises a slot or a plurality of slots each of which is formed in the bumper cover and extends longitudinally of the vehicle and a bolt or plurality of bolts each of which is inserted through one of the slots to fasten the bumper cover to the bumper reinforcing member.Each of the bolts is inserted through the respective slot in such a position that there remains clearance between the outer end of the slot and the bolt to allow an inward sliding movement of the bumper cover toward the bumper reinforcing member. It is optional to form a slot or plurality of slots on the side of the bumper reinforcin g member, instead of the side of the bumper cover. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring to Figs. 4 6, a front bumper unit according to the present invention is generally denoted by reference numeral 21, and the front bumper unit 21 comprises a bumper reinforcing member 22 which is fixed by means of bolts to bumper stays 26 which is in turn fixed to front side members 27 of a vehicle body, an impact absorbing member 23 disposed in front of the bumper reinforcing member 22, and a bumper cover 24 covering the surface of the impact absorbing member 23. The bumper cover 24 generally has upper and lower plate sections 24a and 24b extending longitudinally of the vehicle. The bumper reinforcing member 22 generally has upper and lower sections 22a and 22b.The upper and lower plate sections 24a and 24b of the bumper cover 24 are fastened by means of bolts 28 to the upper and lower sections 22a and 22b of the bumper reinforcing member 22. In the right and left side portions and near the middle portion of the upper and lower plate sections 24a and 24b of the bumper cover 24, there are formed elongate holes or slots 29 elongated longitudinally of the vehicle and the length L of the elongate holes is made slightly longer than a distance for movement D which is formed between the impact absorbing member 23 of the bumper cover 24 and the front side of the bumper reinforcing member 22.This distance for movement D allows the bumper cover 24 to move rearwards through the distance D when the bumper cover 24 and the impact absorbing member 23 absorb and dissipate impact energy in a light collision, and thus serves to prevent a large deformation in the vertical direction of the bumper cover 24 and the impact absorbing member 23 as well as to prevent occurrence of cracks in the surface of the bumper cover 24. The bumper unit of the present invention is assembled as follows Before vehicle body coating operation, the bumper reinforcing member 22 of the bumper unit 21 is fastened by means of bolts to the bumper stays 26 which are fixed to the front side members 27 of the vehicle body. Then after the body coating operation, the impact absorbing member 23 and the bumper cover 24 are fastened to the bumper reinforcing member 22 by means of bolts The bumper cover 24 is fastened to the bumper reinforcing member 22 in such a manner that the bolts fastening therebetween are positioned at the rear end of the elongate hole elongated longitudinally of the vehicle and therefore there is formed between the front surface of the bumper reinforcing member 22 and the impact absorbing member 23 a distance D slightly shorter than the longth L of the elongate holes. When an external force as shown in Fig. 4 is applied to the front bumper unit 21 arranged in this way, the bumper unit 21 is deformed as shown by phantom lines in Fig. 4. That is, the portion of the front bumper unit near the center of the vehicle width slides along the elongate holes rearwardly of the vehicle and at the same time the both side portions of the front bumper unit 21 advance forwardly of the vehicle through the length of the elongate holes 29. However the front bumper unit of the present invention is not deformed in the vertical direction. Although, in the embodiment mentioned above, a front bumper is taken as an example, the present invention is, of course, applicable also to a rear bumper. And the elongate holes 29 are formed on the side of the bumper cover 24 but these elongate holes may be formed in the upper and lower sections of the bumper reinforcing member 22. Furthermore whether the bumper cover 24 and the impact absorbing member 23 are formed integrally or separately is not important to the present invention, According to the present invention, as will be understood from the foregoing description, either in the upper and lower sections of the bumper reinforcing member 22, or in the upper and lower plate sections of the bumper cover 2 , there are provided elongate holes for allowing a movement of the bumper cover during a collision of the vehicle.Therefore the bumper unit of the present invention is not deformed in the vertical direction and does not cause damages to a radiator or other vehicle body members. The bumper unit of the present invention is free from cracks after deformed in a collision and therefore the deformed bumper unit is easily restored to the original state. Furthermore the bumper cover is mounted on the bumper reinforcing member by fastening them by means of bolts at the upper and lower sections of the bumper reinforcing member. Therefore the bumper reinforcing member can be installed before a body coating operation and then, after the body coating operation, the bumper cover and the impact absorbing member can be installed.As a result, a rust prevention process for the bumper reinforcing member becomes unnecessary and the mounting operation is made very easy because the bumper reinforcing member can be installed on the bumper stays before the installation of the front fender.
