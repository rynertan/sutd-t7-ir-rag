# Improvements relating to carding engines.

## Abstract
A carding engine comprises a carding cylinder 1 rotatable between bends 2a at each side of the carding engine. A series of flats 20 are provided, each flat having opposite end sections, the flats being movable over an arc of the cylinder surface. Each bend comprises a stationary section 2a and a plurality of rollers 9, 13, 14 each mounted on the stationary section for rotation about axes parallel to the cylinder axis. The rollers are located such that the radially outermost parts thereof relative to the cylinder form a support path substantially co axial with the cylinder, the rollers forming a support for the end sections of the flats as they travel over the arc of the cylinder surface.
