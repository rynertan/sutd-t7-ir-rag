# Method of preparing alpha l aspartyl l phenylalanine methyl ester and its hydrochloride.

## Abstract
α L aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester and its hyd rochloride are prepared by a process which comprises dissol ving α L aspartyl L phenylalanine dimethyl ester in a methanol hydrochloric acid mixture solvent which contains, when hydrochloric acid es expressed in terms of concentrated hydrochloric acid and water, 0 to 10 by volume of methanol, 8 to 55 by volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid and water balance to give a solution in which the concentration of said ester is from 0.01 mol dl to 0.3 mol dl holding said solution at 0 to 60 C to crystallize out the formed α L aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester as its hydrochloride isolating said hydrochloride and obtaining, when required, the free ester by neutralization with an alkali. The ester pre pared by this process is useful as a sweetener.
