# Buried servo recording system having dual transducers.

## Abstract
The magnetic recorder has a pair of first and second transducers 5a, 5b arranged in the longitudinal direction of a record track 6 . The magnetic recorder exchanges signals with a magnetic record medium 1 having a servo control signal prerecorded in a lower layer 3a of said medium 1 . A recording circuit 8 is connected to the first transducer 5a for recording a data signal along the record truck 6 in an upper layer 3b of the medium 1 . A reading circuit 9, 10 is connected to one of the first and second transducers 5a, 5b for reading the recorded data signal. The second transducer 5b is connected to a servo control circuit connected for reading the prerecorded servo control signal 12 to 15 and deriving therefrom a position error signal in response to which the position of the transducers 5a, 5b is controlled.
