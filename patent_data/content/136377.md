## Description
OLIC nMERIZATION OF OLEFINS AND SYNTHETIC LUBRICANT CCtPP.ISING OLEFIN OLIGOMERS The invention relates to processes for the production of oliqorers from olefins, and more particularly relates to the production of oligomers from internal olefins by means of a boron trifluoride catalyst. The invention also relates to the use of the oligom.erized product as a synthetic lubricant. Friedel Crafts catalysts have long been known to oligomerize olefins. For example, see US A 3 10 925 in which olefins are mixed with alkylatable aromatic hydrocarbons over a Friedel Crafts catalyst to form an alkylation sludge, which is then mixed with olefins having 3 to 18 carbon atoms which are also passed over the catalyst to produce olefin dimers. US A 3 652 706 describes the polymerization of olefins having 2 to 20 carbon atoms over a Friedel Crafts metal halide catalyst plus hvdrogen mordenite to produce compounds having a molecular weight between 700 and 2,500.Production of a gasoline fuel composition is described in US A 3 749 560, involving reacting a mixture of mono olefins greater than 50 weight of alpha olefing over a Friedel Crafts catalyst heated to a temperature around 145 C to produce oligomers having molecular weights of 350 to 1,500. Also, US A 3 149 178 reveals an improved method for making polymerized olefin synthetic lubricants via a particular distillation technique of oligomers made from alpha mono olefins using aFriedel Crafts catalyst. Alpha olefins having 6 to 12 carbon atoms may be dirnerized in the presence of a FriedelCrafts catalyst according to the method described in US A 4 172 855. It is also known that the term Friedel Crafts catalysts includes boron trifluoride, among other metal halide type Lewis catalysts, see Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technologv, Third Edition, Vol. 11, pg 292. Boron trifluoride has also been known to polymerize olefins, see F. Albert Cotton, et al., Advanced InorganicChemistry A Comprehensive Text, Interscience Publishers, 1962, p. 191. A number of US patents disclose the use of BF3 to oligomerize olefins. Close study will reveal that alpha olefins are considered the only useful form. For example,US A 2 780 664 describes the reaction of conjugated dienes with mono alpha and internal olefins over BF3 promoted by an ether mixed with a haloalkane diluent at a temperature from 30 to 100 C to produce oligomers suitable for drying oils. Alpha olefins having from 5 to 20 carbon atoms are oligomerized using BF3 plus an alcohol or water promoter as described in US A 3 382 291. In this patent, BF3 and a mixture of BF, plus the promoter complex are introduced in two separate streams.US A 3 742 082 concerns the dimerization of alpha olefins via BF3, which is promoted with phosphoric acid or water at a 0 temperature from 100 to 150 C. US A 3 763 244 describes the oligomerization of n alpha olefins having 6 to 16 carbon atoms over BF3 promoted with water, at a temperature between 10 and 600C, where it is preferred that BF3 is added continuously. US A 3 769 363 describes the oligomerization of olefins having 6 to 12 carbon atoms using BF3 with a carboxylic acid promoter having at least 3 carbon atoms at a temperature between 0 and 20 C, oligomerization being selective to the trimer form. US A 3 780 128 relates to the oligomerization of alpha olefins having 6 to 16 carbon atoms in which BF3 is employed in a molar excess of alcohol . US A 3 876 720 describes a two step procedure by which alpha olefins having 8 to 12 carbon atoms are converted into vinylidene olefins, which are then reacted over a 1 1 molar complex of BF3 and alcohol to produce oligomerized vinylidene olefins. A method for oligomerizing both short and long chain alpha olefins having from 14 to 20 carbon atoms simultaneously over BF3 with an alcohol or water promoter at O to 600C with a monomer recycle is described in US A 4 225 739.US A 4 263 465 describes a two step process for reacting l butene with a higher alpha olefin over BF3 in the presence of a proton donor at a temperature from 30 to 50 C to produce an oligomer having 8 to 18 carbon atoms. The intermediate oligomer is reacted with other higher alpha mono olefins over the same catalyst system from 30 to 600C to produce oligomers having 20 to 40 carbon atoms. For more information on BF3 ca.talyzed oligomerization of alpha olefins, see Brennan, Wide Temperature Range SyntheticHydrocarbon Fluids, Ind. Eng. Chem. Prod. Poses. Dev. 1980,Vol. 19, pp 2 6 and Shubkin et al., Olefin OligomerSynthetic Lubricants Structure and mechanism of Formation Ind. Eng. Chem. Prod. Res. Dev. 1980, Vol. 19, pp 15 19. Two patents have been located which involve the reaction of internal olefins over Friedel Crafts catalysts.US A 4 167 534 describes olefins which are both alpha and internal having from 10 to 15 carbon atoms which are reacted over Friedel Crafts catalysts between 20 and 2000C to produce oligomers. The only catalysts used in the examples of this patent are AlCl3 and NeAlC14. The internal olefins are also those that are statistically distributed. Also, the oligomers found useful therein seem to be the hydrogenated bottoms product after the unreacted olefins are removed, without further distillation. US A 4 218 330 describes hydrogenated dimers from alpha olefins having from 12 to 18 carbon atoms, especially 1tetradecene, made using a Friedel Crafts catalyst, which includes therein boron trifluoride with a promoter.This method uses predominantly alpha olefins, although the specification mentions that fairly large amounts of internal olefins can be tolerated without adversely affecting the physical properties of the oligomer . This last remark reveals the general feeling of those working in the field that internal olefins do not produce oligomers with good properties for synthetic lubricants. For example, US A 3 952 071 reveals that olefins may be oligomerized in the presence of a mixture of a polyhydric alcohol derivative and an aluminum halide. This patent specification mentions that the olefin could be internal or alpha, but alpha olefins are the only ones used in the examples. US A 3 947 509 also claims that internal olefins may be used over a ketone , ester , ether or alcohol promoted aluminum chloride catalyst, although only alpha olefins are used in the examples. US A 4 300 006 describes a process for producing a hydrocarbon oil by contacting a mixture of alpha and at least 50 weight percent internal olefins with a boron trifluoride dimerization catalyst, but the productivity of useful products is quite low. For example, an alkane diluent is found to be necessary in the process described therein which, in addition to distilling out the lights and the heavies to obtain the lube oil, results in little useful product. Further, this method requires a much longer reaction time and a higher catalvst concentration than desired. It would be beneficial if a method for producing synthetic lubricant components could be devised which would overcome the aforementioned disadvantages. In the field of oligomerizing olefins for synthetic lubricants, it is a continual problem to produce olefins having low viscosities at room temperature and below but which have a high viscosity index and low volatility. This invention provides a process for oligomerization of mono olefins by contacting a mixture of mono olefins with a catalyst, preferably at a temperature from 25 to 150 C, wherein the mono olefins comprise a mixture containing at least 99 weight of internal mono olefins having 9 to 24 carbon atoms and the catalyst comprises boron trifluoride, and preferably a promoter selected from alcohols, carboxylic acids, and water. This invention also provides a lubricant composition comprising a major amount of oligomerized olefins as defined above and minor amounts of conventional lubricant additives. Preferably the lubricant composition contains 10 to 40 weight percent of the oligomerized olefins, which generally have a viscosity at 990C of 3.5 to 5.0 centistokes, a viscosity at 250C of 25 to 40 centistokes, a viscosity index of at least 100 and a thermogravimetric analysis value of greater than 80 weight . A suitable formulation for a lubricant composition according to the invention may comprise i from 0.1 to 15.0 wt. of viscosity index improver, ii from 0.01 to 10 wt. on an oil free basis of a detergent dispersant system, iii from 0.01 to 3.0 wt. of oxidation and wear inhibi tors, iv from 10 to 1,000 parts per million of antifoamant, and v optionally one or more friction modifiers, rust inhibitors or pour point depressants. It has surprisingly been discovered that oligomers which have an unusual combination of properties may be made by reacting predominantly internal mono olefins with boron trifluoride and a promoter. It must be stressed that this has not been discovered by any of the other researchers in the field. It is also important to note that predominantly internal olefins are employed in the method of this invention. Generally, the olefins should have 9 to 24 carbon atoms. The internal olefins used herein have the double bond randomly distributed across the molecule. In this context, the term randomly distributed means that the double bond in the internal olefin is not predominantly in any one location. For example, an olefin mixture comprising a majority of alpha olefins would be outside the scope of this definition since the double bond would be located predominantly between the first and second carbon atoms of the molecules. Likewise, since the internal olefins used for oligomerization in the method of US A 4 300 006 are made by disproportionation of alpha olefins, the double bond is located predominantly at or near the centre of the molecule, and such olefin feedstocks also fall outside the definition of having a random distri button of the double bond.A random distribution includes the distribution one may obtain upon the dehydrogenation of paraffins. One would expect a small amount of alpha olefin to result from such a distribution. However, one would also anticipate that the alpha olefin proportion would be only about 0.1 weight percent, with a maximum value being 1.0 weight percent. As a practical matter, the feedstocks herein can be considered to be entirely internal olefins. The internal olefins may be generally expressed by the formula RCH CHR where R and R are the same or different alkyl radicals Qf 1 to 21 carbon atoms, but the total number of carbon atoms should not exceed 24 and should not be less than 9. The internal olefin mixtures are potentially more available than the pure cut alpha olefins and are potentially as cheap or cheaper than the corresponding pure cut alphas. It will be shown that the method of this invention affords higher quality products and higher conversions than those obtained with AlCl3 and AlCl4Na catalysts. By careful selection of the molecular weight of the feed olefins and the reaction conditions, it was found that a synthetic lubricant base oil with a specific viscosity can be made by the method of this invention which has superior properties over those made by other methods.For example, it has been found that a base oil having a viscosity of about 4 centistokes at 99 0C with excellent properties can be made from internal olefins having 13 or 14 carbon atoms. A 4 centistoke fluid is a designation given to fluids used in lubricating oil compositions which generally have viscosities of about 4 centistokes at 990C The catalyst is boron trifluoride.A number of different kinds of promoters may be used, such as alcohols, carboxylic acids or ater. It is especially preferred that l butanol be used as the promoter. The temperature range at which the oligomerization may be performed successfully is from 25 to 150 C, with an especially r..re rer red range frorn 65 to lOS0C. The pressure range of the reaction may run from atmospheric to 70 bars. The oligomerization of the olefins may be conducted batchwise or continuously. The lubricating oil compositions of this invention comprise a major amount preferably 10 to 40 sleight pèr cent of the synthetic lubricant component of this invention the hydrogenated olefin oligomers described above , or a mixture of the synthetic lubricant component and a conventional base stock, and minor amounts of additive components. The conventional base stocks mentioned above, also called lubricating hydrocarbon mineral base oils, can be paraffinic base, naphthene base or mixed paraffin naphthene base distillate or residual mineral oils, or synthesized base oils. Paraffin base distillate lubricating oil fractions are the preferred mineral oils for the formulation of crankcase lubricants. The lubricating oil base will generally have been subjected to solvent refining, to improve its lubricating properties and viscositytemperature relationship, as well as to solvent dewaxing, to remove any waxy components and to improve the pour characteristics of the oil. Suitable synthetic lubricating oils for preparing the lubricants of this invention these are apart from the internal olefin oligomers discussed previously include the ester base oils prepared from polyhydroxy alcohols such as pentaerythritol and trimethylolpropane and aliphatic mono carboxlic acids, the ester base oils prepared from diacid such as dimer acid and azelaic acid and monoalkanols, synthetic hydrocarbons such as polyalpha olefins, and polyglycols and thiols, silicone fluids, polyphenyl ethers and thioethers. Generally, conventional base stocks having a viscosity at 38 0C between 50 and 1,000 SUS, preferably between 70 and 500SUS can be used in the formulation of the lubricants of this invention. A blend of conventional base oils can be employed, if desired. The lubricating oil compositions of this invention contain additives to enhance the performance characteristics of the synthetic lubricant component or synthetic lubricant component conventional base stock mixture. The additives may be any of the suitable standard pour depressants, viscosity index improvers, detergent dispersants, corrosion, oxidation, and wear inhibitors, antifoamants, or friction modifiers. The choice of the particular additives to be included in the finished oils and the particular amounts thereof will depend on the use and the conditions desired for the finished oil product. Specific examples of the supplementary additives are as follows Viscosity Index Improvers and Pour Depressants A widely used and suitable viscosity index improver pour depressant is the polymethacrylate having the general formula EMI8.1 where R is an aliphatic radical, having f ron 1 to 20 carbon atoms and n is 600 to 35,000.One of the most suitable viscosity index improvers is the disPersant polymethacrylate tetrapolyine of butyl methacrylate, dodecyl methacrylate, octadecyl methacrylate and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate having a respective component weight ratio in the polymer of about 4 10 5 1. mother viscosity improver is a copolymer of ethylene and 30 to 50 weight percent of propylene having a molecular weight of 20,000 to 50,000, or the derivative thereof having pendant brgano nitrogen functionality contributing 0.1 to 0.5 weight percent nitrogen to the polymer. The viscosity index improvers and or pour depressants are normally employed in the finished lubricant compositions in quantities from 0.01 to 15 percent by weight. Detergent Di spersants Examples of detergent dispersants which can be employed are the eEDxylated inorganic phosphorus acid free, steam hydrolyzed, polyisobutene P2S5 reaction products further described in US A 4 272 744, 3 087 956 and 3 123 630 the adducts formed from neopentylpolyol inorganic phosphorus acid free, stearn hydrolyzed polyisobutene P2S5 reaction product as further described in US A 3 281 395, the C50 C200 alkenyl succinimide derivatives of alkene polyamines of the type described in US A 3 172 892 and 3 210 383. The succinimide derivatives have the formula EMI9.1 wherein R is alkenyl having from 50 to 2,000 carbon atoms, and x is O to 10.Particularly suitable examples are where P is polyisobutene having a molecular weight of 1,000 to 1,500, and x is 4 or 5, and mixtures thereof.Further detergent dispersants include the alkaline earth metal alkylphenolates, such as barium nonylphenolate, barium dodecylcresolate, calcium dodecylphenolate and the calcium carbonate overbased calcium alkyl sulfonates formed by blowing a mixture of calcium hydroxide and calcium alkaryl sulfonate e.g., calcium alkylbenzene sulfonate of about 900 molecular weight with carbon dioxide to form a product having a total base number TBN of 50 or more, typical values being 300 to 400. Detergentdispersants are present in the finished compositions of the invention in amounts from 0.1 to 15.0 weight percent.Oxidation, Corrosion and Wear Inhibitors Commonly employed lube oil oxidation and wear inhibitors are the divalent dialkyl dithiophosphates resulting from the neutralization of a P2S5 alcohol reaction product with a divalent metal or divalent metal oxide. Barium and zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate are specific examples. Another class of antioxidants comprises the polyalkylated diphenylamines, such as a mixture of 2,2 diethyl 4 ,4 1 dioctyl diphenylamine and 2,2 diethyl4 octyl diphenylamine. A further class of antioxidants comprises the polyalkylated and the polyalkylated methylene bridged phenols. Commonly employed corrosion inhibitors include the ethoxylated alkylphenol derivatives.The corrosion, oxidation and wear inhibitors are usually present in the finished lubricating oil compositions in concentrations of 0.01 to 3 weight percent.Antifoamants If antifoamants are employed in the finished compositions, one widely used class which is suitable are the dimethyl silicone polymers, typically employed in amounts of 10 to 1,000 ppm. There are many other additives which may be useful in a lubricating oil composition as encompassed by this invention. Many of these components are listed in the disclosures of US A 3 864 270 4 169 799 4 194 981 and 4 253 980, which patents are themselves concerned with novel additives. The invention will be further illustrated with reference to the following Examples. First, the experimental methods will be described, and then the results will be tabulated. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES A number of comparative oligomerization examples were run using the procedures of US A 4 167 534. It is believed that this patent constitutes the closest prior art. The examples herein were patterned after Examples 1, 5 and 7 of US A 4 167 534. These examples were chosen because they represented a wide variety of conditions, particularly temperature. The primary variable in the comparative examples is the olefin feedstock, although sometimes twice the amount of All13 used in US A 4 167 534 is employed in an attempt to improve the conversion. According to the disclosure of US A 4 167 534,Example 1 is begun by heating the feedstock to 800C. 1 AlC13 is then added over 15 minutes. The temperature is then raised to l000C and maintained at this level for 100 minutes. The product is then discharged, separated from the heavy catalyst layer, washed with caustic solution and then distilled. Example 5 begins by adding 1 PlC13 in only one portion to theolefin feedstock at room temperature. The temperature is allowed to rise autogenously for 120 minutes. The product is then discharged, separated from the heavy catalyst layer, washed with caustic solution and distilled. 5 NaA1C14 is then added to the feedstock of Example 7 of US A 4 167 534 at l300C over 90 minutes. The reaction mass is then maintained at 1300C for a further 60 minutes. The product is then discharged, separated from the heavy catalytic layer, washed with caustic solution and distilled. The results of the comparative examples are shown in Table 1 below.

The weight percent of the bottoms as based on the olefin charged is given in the next column. While these two columns of data generally measure the same concept notice the qualitative correlation , the applicants prefer to use conversion while US A 4 167 534 uses the bottoms method. Both are employed in the examples of Table 1 for comparative purposes. Kinematic viscosities at two standard temperatures are given in centistokes. The viscosity index VI is the change in viscosity with temperature such that the higher the number, the lower is the change in viscosity with temperature. Conversely, a low VI signifies a large change in viscosity with temperature. Pour point is a measure of the lowest temperature, in degrees Celsius, at which the sample will begin to pour. Below that temperature, the composition may generally be regarded as a solid.The thermogravimetric analysis TGA is a measure of volatility via measuring the weight percent of sample remaining at 233 C as the temperature is raised in a slow, uniform manner, usually 100C per minute. An oligomeric product should have a TGA analysis with at least 80 of the sample remaining at 233 0C in order to have sufficiently low volatility to be useful as a base stock for lube oil formulation. EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATING THE INVENTION The following examples illustrate the method of the invention using BF3 as the catalyst and only internal olefins as the olefin feedstock. Two examples are included using C14 alpha olefin as the feedstock to show that an unsuitable oligomer mixture is produced. The oligomer from alpha olefins having 14 carbon atoms l tetradecene was deficient in its low temperature properties for use in crankcase engine oils. Generally, the viscosity at 250C should be 30 to 30.5 centistokes cs or less while the C14 alpha olefin oligomer was observed to have a viscosity in the 32 33 cs range. The pour point of a synthetic lubricant base oil candidate should be less than 450C. These differences are exaggerated at 300C the temperature at which cold cranking viscosity tests are done and would result in too viscous a fluid at cold temperature. Preferably, a 4 centistoke fluid measured at 99 C should have a viscosity of 25 to 40 centistokes at 25 C, a viscosity of 3.5 to 5.0 centistokes at 99 C, a viscosity index of greater than 100, a pour point of less than 45 C and a thermogravimetric analysis percent remaining at 233 C value of greater than 80 weight percent. It is especially preferred that 4 centistoke fluids have a viscosity of between 25 and 34 centistokes at 2 0 , 0 at 25 C, a viscosity between 3.5 and 4.5 cs at 99 C, a minimum viscosity index of 110, a maximum pour point of less than 450C and a thermogravimetric analysis TGA value of 86 , minimum. EXAMPLE 12 A solution of 43.8 g of C13 14 15 random internal linear olefins 53.4 C13, 45.0 C14, 0.5 C15, 1.1 paraffins and 0.12 g of 1 butanol in a nitrogen atmosphere was saturated with BF3 et 25 C by slow sparging for 25 minutes. Pot contents were maintained at 25 270C by external cooling, while 55.6 g of a solution of 55.0 g of C13 14 15 olefins and 0.8 g of l butanol was added over 100 minutes. Boron trifluoride saturation was maintained during this addition and for 105 minutes thereafter. BF3 introduction was stopped and the pot contents were heated to 86 C over a 105 minute period, and maintained at 8586 C for 30 minutes. After cooling, 110 ml of H2O was added the contents were stirred rapidly for 20 minutes, and the top layer was removed.It was washed with 115 ml of H20 and stripped on a rotary evaporator at 4000 Pa to a maximum bath temperature of 950C 96.9 g of a clear light yellow liquid remained 98.3 recovery . Analysis by gel permeation chromatography indicated 61.34 dimer, 25.13 trimer, and 12.95 monomer, the balance being higher oligomers. EXAMPLE 13 The product of Example 12 93.8 g was hydrogenated over 9.60 g of a powdered Ni Cu Cr catalyst, which is described in US A 3 152 998. The conditions included aPressure of 125 bars and a temperature of predominantly 208 C with temperature briefly reaching 316 C . Vacuum stripping was conducted at 120 Pa with a maximum head temperature of 1050C and a maximum pot temperature of l570C, to remove 11.89 g of lighter components The monomers . The hydrogenated bottoms product consisted GPC analysis of 26.7 trimer, 67.8 dimer, and 3.41 monomer. The kinematic viscosities at 25 C, 38 C, and 99 C were 29, 57, 18.26 and 3.89 centistokes, respectively. The pour point was measured to be less than A50C. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated 81.38 of the sample remained at 233 C. EXAMPLE 14 This is essentially the same procedure as Example 12, except that BF3 introduction was stopped when olefin l butanol introduction stopped. The heating period was for 2 hours at 900C. GPC analysis indicated 19.8 trimer, 62.28 dimer and 17.94 monomer, the balance being higher oligomers.Hydrogenation In order to form materials which have adequate oxidative stability for lubricants, the oligomerized olefins are optionally hydrogenated, either partially or totally.This hydrogenation is done by procedures known to those skilled in the art as exemplified by US A 4 045 508 4 01J 736 3 997 622 and 3 997 621. A particularly preferred catalyst for this hydrogenation is a nickel copperchromia catalyst described in US A 3 152 998. As is well known, such hydrogenations may be performed either batchwise or continuously. When the method of the present invention was scaled up for a pilot plant run, it was discovered that the resulting oligomer mixture did not give the expected desirable properties seen in the lab scale experiments.In the pilot plant scale up, stripping out the monomer was performed first and then hydrogenation was conducted over the nickel copper chromia catalyst described above.Monomer removal was performed before hydrogenation and monomers were recycled to the oligomerization step. During the pilot plant stripping step, however, over 50 of the oligomeric material came off overhead at temperatures from 210 to 282 0C in an attempt to obtain a material with a good TGA volatility value. Apparently, some of the unhydrogenated oligomer mixture was thermally unstable, and portions of it were reverting to monomers or intermediates and distilling off as volatiles. It is, therefore, important that monomer removal be accomplished under conditions as mild as possible that is, the reboiler or pot temperature should preferably be kept at or under 1800C when stripping out monomer. While the methods of others in the field include a distillation step after hydrogenation, to obtain products having various viscosities at 990C, it is much preferred in the method of the invention that no further distillation be conducted. In other words, the monomer stripped, hydrogenated bottoms are the desired synthetic lubricant components. Thus the method of this invention does not require the customary distillation step, yet surprisingly produces a synthetic lubricant component that has excellent properties and performs in a superior fashion. It is also anticipated however, that one skilled in the art may find subsequent distillation useful in the practice of the method of this invention. EXAMPLES 15 26 The following examples illustrating the method of the invention were conducted according to one of the following procedures.Procedure A Examples 15 to 18 used the following experimental procedure. To a 300 ml stainless steel autoclave was charges 158.6 9 of olefin and 1.4 g of 1 butanol. The autoclave was sealed and heated to approximately 98 C at which time BF3 gas was introduced in amounts ranging from 3.1 to 4.4 g average 3.8 g BF3 per run . The reaction mixture was stirred and allowed to generate heat on its own no cooling . The reaction mixture was stirred for 60 minutes time measured from first BF3 addition, andBF3 was added over a 3 6 minute period . Cooling water was then turned on. The cooled reaction mixture was neutralized with 10 grams of Na2C03 and 100 ml of H2O. After layer separation, the organic later was washed twice more with fresh water and dried. The oligomer was analyzed GPC IC for conversion and subjected to hydrogenation at 210 C 2 hours , 140 Bars H2 pressure in the presence of a nickel copper chromium oxide catalyst 5 by weight basis weight oligomer . Stripping the oligomers of mono mer was performed after hydrogenation in all of Examples 15 26 in a manner similar to that of Example 27.Procedure B Examples 19 to 23 used procedure B, which was identical to procedure A except that 0.7 g of butanol was used instead of 1.4 g and the amount of BF3 added ranged from 2.2 to 2.8 g with a 2.5 g average.Procedure C Examples 24 to 26 used procedure C, which was identical to procedure A except that the temperature of the reaction mixture olefin and promoter before BF3 addition was 650C instead of 980C and the amount of BF3 added ranged from 2.2 g to 4.0 g 3.0 g average . Conversions and properties of the oligomers are summarized in Table 2 below. It should be noted that the amount of catalyst used in the method of this invention 1.4 to 2.8 weight percent of the olefin feed is notably less than the amount of catalyst used in other methods in the field, such as the method disclosed in US A 4 300 006 2.6 to 6.1 weight percent . In further contrast with the method of this particular patent, no employment of a diluent, no heavies or lights except monomers were removed, and a shorter reaction time are features of the inventive method. Another difference lies in the fact that the method of US A 4 300 006 uses a mixture of alpha and internal olefins having carbon numbers that are quite different from each other, unlike the instant method.

No examples have higher viscosities at both 990C and 250C than do the alpha olefin oligomers from Examples 4, 8 and 11. It must be remembered that the method of the present invention has the requirement of using only internal olefins to obtain low viscosities, a feature not found in any related method.It should also be pointed out that oligomers made from alpha olefins Examples 4, 8, 11, 23 and 26 have rather high pour points, which make them unacceptable for use in synthetic lubricants. The high pour point of Example 19 is thought to be an erroneous data point. Secondly, it may be noted that the viscosities of the BF3 catalyzed oligomers are all lower than those produced by the method of US A 4 167 534. In addition, the conversions are much higher in the BF3 runs. It is particularly surprising that C internal olefins Examples 15, 19 and 24 , having a higher average molecular weight than the Cull 14 internal olefins Examples 16 18, 20 22 and 25 produce oligomer mixtures having a lower viscosity than the mixtures from Cll 14 internal olefins. These examples show how the choice of molecular weight range of the olefin feedstock greatly affects the properties of the product oligomers. It is surprising that such low viscosities relative to other methods may be found in oligomer mixtures that also have low pour points and viscosity indexes and volatilities comparable with those of other methods. It is precisely such a combination of advantageous properties that is being sought after in the field and which has not been discovered until now. In addition, it should be noted that the method revealed in US A 4 300 006 requires that the dimerization feedstock be obtained from the disproportionation of alpha olefins having 8 to 10 carbon atoms. As a result, the dimerization feedstocks used therein are a mixture of alpha and internal olefins where the alpha olefins have slightly more than half the carbon number of the corresponding internal olefins and the internal olefins are highly symmetrical being formed from the disproportionation of two alpha olefins . For example, Runs IX and XII therein oligomerize C14, C16 and C18 internal olefins where the double bond is at or near the centre of the olefin molecule.The method of the present invention uses internal olefins where the double bond is randomly distributed, instead of located near the centre of a symmetrical mono olefin. These differences in the feedstocks cause important differences in the properties of the resulting oligomers, as shown by the following Examples involving C14 internal olefin and C8 alpha olefin as a mixed feedstock. EXAMPLE 27Oligomerization The oligomerization of a 70 weight percent C1 internal olefin and 30 weight percent C8 alpha olefin mixture was accomplished over 2.5 g of a boron trifluoride catalyst with 1. 1 g of 1 butenol as a protonic promoter and initiated at 95.1 C. To a dry and clean 300 ml Hastelloy C autoclave were added 119 g of C14 internal olefin from Shell ChemicalCompany s Higher Olefin Process SHOP . The double bond in these internal olefins is randomly distributed throughout the molecule. Added at the same time were 51 g of C8 alpha l octene from Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc. . At the time, this was the closest available approximation of the feedstock of US A 4 300 006. These additions were followed by 1. 1 g of 1 butanol promoter. The autoclave was Sealed and the contents were heated to 95.1 C with stirring.Starting at 95.l0C, BF3 gas was introduced by adding four shots of BF3 over an 11 minute period 2.5 g total BF3 added to the stirred reaction mixture. At the end of 17 minutes measured from the first BF3 addition , the temperature had risen 110.2 C for a maximum exotherm of 15.1 C. One hour after the first BF3 addition the reac 0 tion temperature was 101.5 C. The heat was turned off and cooling water was turned on. The reaction mixture was neutralized with an aqueous Na2C03 solution and washed twice more with water. The organic layer was separated and dried by filtering through folded filter paper to obtain a net weight of 156.3 g.Liquid chromatography analysis indicated 31.9 of the material was C8, C14 orC16, and 27.5 was dimer C22 from C8 and C14 , and 32.28 was dimer C28 from C14 and C14 , while 8.4 was C36 or heavier. Conversion to material lighter than C16 was about 68.1 . The weight ratio of dimer to trimer and heavies was 7.19 1.Hydrogenation and Stripping A 1 litre stirred stainless steel autoclave was charged with 144.5 g of oligomer from the previous step and 7.2 g of a nickel copper chromium oxide hydrogenation catalyst. The autoclave was flushed with hydrogen three or four times, and pressurized to 70 Bars with hydrogen.Subsequently, the autoclave was heated to 2100C the pressure increased to only 83.7 Bars and pressurized again to 139 Bars with hydrogen. The reaction mixture was stirred at 2100C for four hours during which the pressure remained at 139 Bars. The hydrogenated oligomer was filtered and 137.3 g of it was subjected to high vacuum stripping. The material was distilled through a jacketed column with about 40 cm of Goodloe packing until the head temperature reached l050C at 8 Pa. The bottoms weighed 67.1 g 49.6 of the total material, overhead plus bottoms and the overhead weighed 68.3 g 50.4 of the total material . The bottoms product had a viscosity of 3.6 cs at 99 C, a 250C viscosity of 27.4 cs, a pour point of 450C and a viscosity index of 110.Liquid chromato graphy analysis indicated the presence of 25.5 of dimer C22 , 60.2 of dimer C28 and 14.3 of heavier mater ials. The TGA of the bottoms product indicated that volatility was moderately high 85.0 of the sample remained at 2330C in TGA of 100C minute . EXAMPLE 28Oligomerization Oligomerization of a 70 C14 internal olefin 30t C8 alpha olefin mixture catalyzed by 2.2 g of BF3 with 1.1 g of l butanol as a promoter ltas initiated at 94.90C. As in the previous example, 119 g of C14 internal olefin were added to a 300 ml autoclave along with 51 g of C8 alpha olefin followed by 1.1 g of l butanol. The autoclave was sealed and heated to 94.90C. Starting at 94.9 0C, BF3 gas was added over an 11 minute period totalling 2.2 g ofBr3 to produce a 15.1 C maximum exotherm after 16 minutes had elapsed after the first 3F3 addition. After a one hour reaction time, measured from the first BF3 addition, the mixture was cooled and neutralized with aqueous sodium carbonate.The organic layer vas separated and dried by filtering through folded filter paper, to give a net weight of 162.5 g. Liquid chromatographv analysis indicated 31.1 of the material was Cg, C14 or C16, 27.2 was dimer C22 and 33.4 was diner C28 while P.3 was C36 or heavier. Conversion to materials higher than C16 was 68.9 . The weight ratio of dimer to trimer and heavies was 7.30.1. Hydrogenation and Stripping From the above step, 145.0 g of the oligomer was hydrogenated over 7.2 g of nickel copper chromium oxide catalyst. The hydrogenation was conducted at 2100C and 139 Bars for four hours. It was followed by filtration and stripping as described in the previous example. The bottoms products amounting to 55.3 of the charge had a viscosity of 25.7 cs at 250C and a viscosity of 3.45 cs at 99 0C. The pour point of the bottoms material was unacceptably high, 40 C, and the viscosity index was 109.0. Liquid chromatography analysis indicated 33.6 of dimer C22, 53.8 of dimer C28 and 12.6 heavies. The weight ratio of dimer to trimer and heavies was thus 6.94 1. The TGA indicated 82.1 sample remaining. EXAMPLE 29Oligomerization Oligomerization of a 70 C14 internal olefin 30 C8 alpha olefin mixture catalyzed by 2.5 g BF3 and 1.1 g 0 l butanol as promoter was conducted starting at 75.1 C. To a clean and dry 300 ml autoclave were added 119 g ofC14 internal olefin and 51 g of C8 alpha olefin, from the same sources as the previous two examples, followed by 1.1 g of 1 butanol promoter. The autoclave was seal ed and beated to 75.1 C, and at that temperature BF3 gas was added in increments shots over a 10 minute period. Five separate shots were applied to total 2.5 g. Eleven minutes after the first BF3 addition, the reaction temperature had risen to 100. 7 C a maximum exotherm of 25.6 C . The cooled and aorked up as in the previous examples.The dry product from this lower temperature oligomerization had the following liquid chromatography analysis 12.7 of monomer C8, C14 and C16 , 23.7 of C22, 42.1 of C28 and 21.5 of trimer and heavies. Conversion to materials greater than C16 was 87.3 with the weight ratio of dimer to trimer and heavies being 3.07 1.Hydrogenation and Stripping Hydrogenation of the oligomer from the above step was completed at 2100C for 4.0 hours at 139 Bars hydrogen pressure. Workup filtration , followed by high vacuum stripping, afforded a bottoms product which amounted to 70.7 of the charge and had the following properties viscosity of 4.16 cs at 990C, viscosity of 34.5 cs at 250C, pour point of 450C and a viscosity index of 124.2.The liquid chromatography analysis indicated 16.7 of the material was C22, 56.8 was C28 and 26.5 was heavies.TGA indicated the sample had excellent volatility 90 remaining at 233 C . EXAMPLES 30 38 Examples 30 to 35 were conducted in a manner similar to Examples 27 to 29, except that certain parameters were changed as shown in Table 3. Examples 36 to 38 were conducted according to the following procedure. Eighty three grams of A7 C14 and 36 9 g of b C18 internal olefin and 51 g of C8 alpha olefin were added to a 300 ml autoclave followed by 1.1 g of 1butanol. This olefin mixture is the closest approximation to the feed stocks of US A 4 300 006 obtainable with the materials on hand. The autoclave was sealed and BF3 was introduced in the indicated quantities. Workup was conducted as usual, involving an aqueous Na2C03 wash followed by two water washes, and filtering the organic layer through filter paper to dry it. Hydrogenation was accomplished at 2100C and in the presence of 5 by weight, basis olefin nickel catalyst and 139 Bars hydrogen pressure for four hours.The hydrogenation product was filtered and distilled at high vacuum 13 Pa and to a head temperature of 1100C. The bottoms product was submitted for analysis. The results of this last set of comparative examples are summarized in Table 3 below.

As can be seen from Table 3, the product from the feedstocks used in US A 4 300 006 are unsuitable for use as a synthetic lubricant without further distillation i.e., the bottoms product found useful using the internal olefin feedstocks of the invention is superior. Examples 32 38 have 990C and or 25 0C viscosities and or pour points which are too high for use as 4 cs synthetic lubricants.One skilled in the art would not expect these materials to pass cold cranking tests. These same feedstocks, when run at a higher temperature, produce a material with a low viscosity index and a poor TGA value see Example 31 . Thus, it is determined by comparative examples using the conditionsof US A 4 300 006 that the resulting products would need to be distilled in order to meet the 4.0 cs 99 C viscosity requirement and apparently the cold cranking specifications as well. The oligomer mixtures produced from C13 14 internal olefins via a promoted BF3 catalyst have proven to be exceptional synthetic lubricant additives. As these mixtures have a viscosity of about four centistokes at 99 0C, they are considered 4 cs fluids. A typical fluid of this invention was compared with the co.ercially available 4 centistoke decene l derived polyalpha olefin PAO . It should be emphasized that the synthetic lubricant components of the instant invention are preferably used without further distillation after the monomer removal and hydrogenation steps. In other words, the undistilled bottoms are the finished synthetic lubricant component. The polyalpha olefins must be distilled into 2 cs , 4 cs , 6 cs , etc. fractions before they can be useful. Thus, the method of this invention does not require a costly distillation step, which is an important advantage over methods used by others in the field. Comparison of the properties of the fluids themselves are given in Table S. It may be seen that the fluid of this invention A is somewhat less viscous than the polyalpha olefin fluid B at the higher temperatures, though it is somewhat more viscous at the lower temperatures. The viscosity index for fluid A is somewhat less than for fluid B, but they are generally comparable.

The oligomer mixtures produced from C1314 internal olefins via a promoted Br3 catalyst have proven to be exceptional synthetic lubricant additives. As these mixtures have a viscosity of about four centistokes at 99 0C, they are considered 4 centistoke fluids. A typical fluid of this invention was compared with the commercially available 4 centistoke decene l derived polyalpha olefin PAO . It should be emphasized that the synthetic lubricant components of the present invention are preferably used without further distillation after the monomer removal and hydrogenation steps. In other words, the undistilled bottoms are the finished synthetic lubricant component. The polyalpha olefins rtust be distilled into 2 centistoke , 4 centistoke , 6 centistoke , etc.fractions before they can be useful. Thus, the method of this invention does not require a costly distillation step, which is an important advantage over methods used by others in the field. Comparisons of the properties of the fluids themselves are given in Table 5. It may be seen that the fluid of this invention A and the commercially available four centistoke decene l derived PAO B are generally comparable.

A measure of the volatility of the two fluids is presented in Table 6 where it may be seen that oligomer A is slightly more volatile than fluid B.

This formulation is shown in Example 42.Except for the 4 centistoke fluid, this oil contains the same proportions of the same supplemental base oil and additives that were employed in the lubricating oil composition of Example 39. That is, the rest of the components of the two formulations are identical in type and proportion and include materials such as mineral oils, dispersants, anti oxidants, detergents, friction modifiers, rust inhibitors, viscosity index improvers, pour point depressants and anti foamants. The proportion of 4 centistoke fluid 35 wt. is large enough to have a profound effect on the behaviour of the formulations in testing.

Sequence IIID tests are oxidation stability tests designed to measure the wear protection characteristics that is, to measure how the oils protect internal loaded engine components against excessive wear. The engine is run at high speed under high loads. The first measurement is the percent increase in 400C viscosity after 64 hours. It is surprising to note that the formulation of Example 39 had a much lower viscosity change than did that ofExample 42, when it is remembered that the oligomer mixture of Example 42 had a higher viscosity index indicating less change of viscosity with temperature than did that of Example 39 see Table 5 . What is also surprising is that the formulation of Example 42 required 5.10 litres of oil for the Sequence IIID tests, whereas that ofExample 39 required only 3.94 litres. This result is contrary to what would be expected from the volatility information derived from the simulated distillation set out in Table 6. It is particularly surprising when it is realized that the 4 cs fluid of this invention comprises only about 25 heavies. One skilled in the art would expect the more volatile material A to cause any formulation made therefrom to require more oil.However, as may be seen in Table 5, it is formulation B, having the less volatile oligomer mixture, which has the greater quantity requirements. In the rest of the sequence IIID tests, the two formulations were quite comparable. However, the formulation A of Example 39 again gives better results in theCoordinating Research Council L 38 test, which is a measure of bearing corrosion by measuring the weight loss of the bearing. In the first determination, the formulation of Example 42 failed the test with a weight loss of 45.9 mg, though it passed on a second attempt with 39.5 mg loss. The formulation of Example 39 caused a much lower weight loss of 24.3 mg. The Caterpillar 1H2 test measures the accumulation of deposits on diesel pistons, among other criteria.Demerits are assigned in this test by the subjective opinion of a person approved by API American PetroleumInstitute . Although the formulation of Example 39 performed poorer than that of Example 42 in the amount of top groove filling found, the weighted total demerits for both durations for Example 39 were much less than that for Example 42. These results are further evidence of the surprisingly superior characteristics of the oligomer mixtures made from only internal olefins and a promoted BF, catalyst.
