# METHOD OF MEASURING ORIENTATION OR DIELECTRIC CHARACTERISTIC OF DIELECTRIC SHEETS OR WEBS

## Abstract
A method of measuring the orientation or dielectric characteristic of a dielectric sheet or web 3 is disclosed, which comprises the steps of inserting a sample portion of the dielectric sheet or web in a small clearance in a cavity resonator formed of a pair of waveguides 2 respectively having a transmitting antenna 5 and a receiving antenna 12 , said waveguides being spaced apart from each other with their openings defining said clearance therebetween, irradiating said sample portion with frequency sweep type linearly polarized microwaves from the upper waveguide perpendicularly to said sample portion while producing a relative motion between the plane of polarization of micro waves and said sample portion around the axis of said cavity resonator, and measuring the resonance frequency of Q value of the microwaves received by the lower waveguide.
