# Fire retardant polyamide composition.

## Abstract
A fire retardant polyamide composition comprising at least 35 by weight of polyamide having a molecular weight of at least 3000, at least 3.5 but preferably not more than 10 by weight of the condensation product of 2 moles perchlorocyclopentadiene and 1 mole of 1,5 cyclooctadiene, at least 2 , preferably at least 4 desirably not more than 10 by weight of melamine, a salt of melamine or an organic derivative of melamine and at least 0.5 , but preferably not more than 5.0 of at least one oxide selected from iron oxide and tin oxide, wherein the weight ratio of chlorinated compound to oxide is between 1 1 and 10 1 preferably between 2 1 and 6 1 and the constituents of the composition total 100 . The composition provides improved burning performance in the UL94 test in that dripping is prevented. The composition also provides acceptable burning perform ance at a lower concentration of total additives than when halogenated fire retardant synergistic oxide combinations are used.
