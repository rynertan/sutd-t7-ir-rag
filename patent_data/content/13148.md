## Description
SEALING CONDUITS This invention relates t the sealing of the ens of conduits through which electric conductors pass, more especially though not exclusively in flame proof electrica equipment By the end of a conduit is meant the end of individual conduit length and not necessarily the end cf the entire run of the conduit, and by sealing is meant forming a seal that is pressure tight or flame proof or both. In the specification of our UK patent application accepted 1524684 we have described a method of terminating an electric cable or conduit on electrical apparatus in which 1 the cable or conduit end is prepared with the individual conductors projecting forwardly from an end of a surrounding protective layer of the cable or from the conduit end as the case may be 2 the cable or conduit is secured in a first gland member, having a passage through which the cable or conduit passes and which has an enlarged section at its forward end, with the end of the protective la7er or conduit in the enlarged section 3 a quantity of hardenable insulatin compound is applied, in a pasty or viscous condition, so as to fill and stand proud of the enlarged section of the passage in the first gland member and to adhere to the parts of the cable or conduit and conductors within it 4 a second gland member, having a passage with an enlarged section at its rear end, is assembled with the first gland member so as to enclose the insulating compound to an extent sufficient to allow generation of pressure in the compound 5 the first and second gland members are drawn together before the insulating compound has hardened so as to press the compound into,firm contact with t cable end 6 the termination is secured to the electrical apparatus by mechanically engaging at least one of the gland members the preset invention provides n related method cf and a kit for sealing a conduit end which is more convenient and more reliable when as is usually the case the crosssectional area of tile conduit is considerably larger than the total cross sectional area of the insulated conductor s . In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a method of sealing a conduit end around one or more than one insulated conductor comprises providing P chamber having a peripheral wall, a base with an opening througn it communicating with the conduit and an opening opposite the base, the conductor, or all the conductors, extending through both openings preforming an annular body of a setting resin composition in a pasty or viscous condition and inserting it in that condition into the chamber to encircle the conductor or conductors and applying axial pressure to the still pasty or viscous annular body to cause it to flow and form a sealing body in peripherally continuous contact with the chamber anA with the, or each, insulated conductor and allowing or causing the resin composition to set. In so cases the chamber may be formed integrally with the conduIt, but in most case be a separate component or an assembly of more into one component screwed or otherwise connected to the conduit end P flameproof screw threaded connection usually preferred. The chamber will usually be a hur that connects the conduit end to the wall of electrical apparatus. The opening in the base of the chamber will usually have a cross sectional area in the range from 0.4 l times the cross sectional area of the conduit, but could be larger or if the number and or size of the conductor s in the conduit is small smaller. In most cases p circular opening is preferred, but its shape could be varied to provide P reduced clearance around P particular group of conductors, or for other reasons, if desired. The opposite side of the chamberIs preferably completely open. When there is more than one insulated conductor, and more especiallr when there are more than two, it is preferable to insert an auxiliary preformed body of the resin composition between them in the chamber before applying pressure and preferably before the annular body is inserted, to facilitate sealing of. interstices between the conductors. Preferably the annular body of the resin composition is formed on a carrier that determines its form at least in part. If the carrier comprises a part that lines the bore of the annular body, which is advantageous, it will in most cases be necessary to remove at least that part of it before or during compression and in this case it, or the part to be removed, should be made of or cord with S material to which the resin composition does nct adhere preferably it is not removed until the annular body is in position in the chamber of nearly so, as in the carrier that helps to avoid smearing of the resin composition. In other cases the carrier may be a permanent part of the seal. The resin composition is preferably a resin putty, and we prefer to use an epoxy resin putty, such as that sold by the Applicant Company under the trademarkBICASEAL. Putties based on acrylic, polyester and polyurethane setting resins are also suitable for most applications. Axial pressure can conveniently be applied by a member urged into the open side of the chamber by screw action when this member is threaded and directly screwed to the chamber wall, it preferably bears on the annular body of resin composition through an intermediate member that does not rotate with it, in order to avoid imposing rotary shearing motion on the resin composition or alternatively the member may be coated, or r ae cf, adhesion material.In other cases the use of an intermediate member Is optional, but in some cases the use of suitably shaped intermediate members both in tis posit and between the resin composition and the base of the may be desirable to prevent the resin adhering to the walls of the chamber and so allow the termination to be unscrewed without damaging te resin seal in this case at least one cf the Intermediate members needs to be sealed to he chamber in a fluid tight and or flameproof manner, e.g.by a suitable sealing ring, n controlled flame gap flameproof path or, where practicable, a screw thread. In one useful flame gap arrangement, annular faces on the intermediate member and the outer member of the chamber may be so shaped that they form between them a path of tortuous configuration, such path forming all or part of the required length of the flameproof path between the members. Preferably, the tortuous path is formed by provid ng on each annular surface a plurality of upstanding, spaced, concentric endless ribs defining between them.a plurality of spaced, concentric endless troughs, ribs on each of said annular surface entering troughs in the other of said annular surfaces. In this case the annular surfaces on the tubular body and on the second annular body preferably lie in planes normal to the axis of the body, and the ribs and troughs may be tightly engaged or slightly spaced apart. The ribs of each annular surface and the troughs on the other annular surface in which the ribs enter may be of any convenient cross sectional shape and size, but, preferably, each rib and inter engaging trough i of substantially triangular cross section. Other crosssectional shapes which the ribs and troughs may take include rectangular and sinusoidal. Preferably, all ribs on botch annular surfaces are of substantially the same crosssectional shape and size as one another. In one alternative arrangement, the tortuous pat is formed by making each annular surface of a stepped configuration comprising plurality of spaced, concentric endless steps. For ease of manufacture, preferably the circumferential surface defining each step is parallel to the axis of the body and the annular surface defining each step lies. in. a plane normal to the axis of the body. The.. step surfaces may tightly engage one another or be slightly spaced apart. Preferably pressure continues to be applied until the resinous compound extrudes from the chamber through one or both of the openings around the insulated conductorts The invention includes a kit for sealing a conduit end around one or more than one insulated conductor comprising a chamber having a peripheral wall, a base with an opening through it for communicating with the conduit and or an opening opposite the base a supply of a setting resin compound a carrier for holding a preformed annular body of the compound in a pasty or viscous condition during insertion into the chamber and means for applying pressure to the annular bod when in the camber to cause to flow and to produce 2 sealing body in peripherally continuous contact with the chamber and with the, cr each, insulated conductor. The invention also includes an electrical Installation including a seal made by the method or by means of the kit described. In order that the invention may more readily be understood, a description is gIven, by way of example orly, reference being made to the accompanying drawings, in which Figures 1 and 2 are sectional views illustrating two stages of a method in accordance with the present invention is a view illustrating a stage similar to that of Figure 1 of another form of the invention Figure 4 shows an alternative carrier for se in the preset invention Figures 5 7 show tree successive stages in a third method in accordance with the invention and Figure 8 shows another form of the invention. In the illustrated forms of the present invention, flameproof sealing connection is effected between a wall 1 of electric apparatus and a conduit 2, which contains two or more electric conductors 3 ,, having a combined cross sectional area considerably smaller than that of conduit 2. In the method illustrated by Figures 1 and 2 a cylindrIcal hub 4 is screwed into the wall and has a base 5 into which is screwed conduit 2, both screw threads being flameproof. The conductors are inserted either before or after these parts are screwed together. An annular element 6 is screwed in a flameproof manner inside the hub 4, and an annular gap 7 is formed around it. A suitable quantity of BICASEAL resin putty is mixed and preformed into en annular body ss in a carrier 9 having an open ended frusto conical shell a pellet 10 of the same resf putty is placed between the conductors 3 in order to help fall any ivterstices between them and reduce the risk that the conductors 3 will so engage one another as to exclude the resin composition from an ared between them.Carrier 9 is then inserted within hub 4 and is urged towards element 6 by screwing cap 11 into the open end of hub 4. The resin forming body 8 is compressed between tile annular element 6 and the carrier 9 and flows radially inwardly to fill spaces between element 6., carrier 9 and the conductors 3. Eventually the resin is extruded from the hub 4 as shown in Figure 2 in order to give visual evidence of an effective seal. If it were desired to provide for the termination formed betwee n conduit 2 and wall 1 to be unscrewed without damaging the resin seal and afterwards re , assembled, the element 6 would need to be secured without directly screwing it in the hub 1, e.g. by using an annular threaded securing ring the carrier 9 and element 6 could still be made of a material to which the resin adheres In the modified method Illustrated in Figures 3 and 4, a mandrel 12 is inserted in the carrier 9 before resin is placed in the carrier this simplifies shaping of the resin and protects the resin body from loss of material through contact with the conductors as carrier 9 is brought into position. Mandrel 1 is coated with a silicone release agent to prevent resin from adhering and once carrier 9 is located in hub L, the mandrel is removed, after which the same procedure is followed as in the method of Figures 1 and 2. In the alternative method of figures 5 7, a cup lgke carrier 22 is temporarily assembled with a stepped circular mandrel 21 coated with silicons release agent , filled with prepared setting resin compound 23, and removed from the mandrel. The carrier, with the annular resin body so formed, is carefully inserted into the base of hub 24. The carrier prevents adhesion of the resin to the hub and so no member equivalent to the element 6 in Figures 1 4 is needed a fernile 2 prevents the resin from adhering to the cap 26. The procedure is ctherwise the same as in the other methods described.The thread connecting the cap 26 to the hub 24 may need to be longer than the corresponding thread in figures 1 4 if full flameproof requirements are to be met. When a seal that is flameproof but not pressure tight is required, E continuous open flame gap can be ensu by providing ribs or other spacers on either or both of the intermediate member and the outer member of the chamber at an appropriate position or positions along the length of the flame gap. Figure 8 illustrates a termination in Accordance with the invention in which the chamber includes an outer member comprising the components 4 and 11 and an inner member comprising the components 6 and 9, all as in figures 1 and 2 except that, to increase the length of the path between the intermediate end outer members, the members 9 and 11 have annular Races 44 and 45 respectively formed with ribs 48 and 49 that interrit to form 2 tortuous path between them.
