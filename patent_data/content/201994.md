# SAFETY GAS CONTAINER AND SAFETY VALVE

## Abstract
A safety gas container including a valve body 2 made of a shape memory alloy, the valve member having top and bottom heads 4 with a stem portion 3 having a relatively small diameter therebetween the valve member is fitted in a gas passageway 5 of the container and the body is previously made to remember a smaller shape at a specific temperature. The valve member changes shape in response to a rise in the ambient temperature above the specific temperature so that a gap occurs between the valve member and the inside wall of the gas passageway.

## Claims
1. A safety gas container permitting gaseous contents to escape slowly at an abnormally elevated temperature, the container being characterised by a valve member 2 made of a shape memory alloy and having a top head and a bottom head 4 with a stem portion 3 with a relatively smaller diameter therebetween, the valve member being fitted in a gas passageway 5 of the container wherein the alloy is made to remember a smaller shape at a specific temperature and whereby the valve is diminished in size in response to a rise in ambient temperature above the specific temperature so that a gap is formed between the stem and the inside of the passageway.

## Description
The present invention relates to pressure vessels such as safety gas containers and more particularly, but not exclusively, a safety gas container for holding a gas of explosive nature, such as carbon dioxide gas, oxygen or a liquefied fuel gas, the container being provided with a valve for permitting the content to escape at such a small rate as to avoid an abrupt ejection of the contents which would cause a reaction on the container thereby to propel it forward. The invention also relates to a safety valve which can be used in or with such a container but which may have a more general utility. In U.S. Patent No. 4,219,126 is disclosed a container with a recess in a sealing plate, the recess having a thin bottom wall which can be ruptured by a rise in internal pressure due to overheating. When the internal pressure abnormally rises an invisible crack occurs in the bottom of the recess the contents gradually leak through the crack to reduce the internal pressure. However, it has been found that such a crack develops from the bottom to the inside wall of the recess, thereby finally causing the whole recess to rupture, the contents of the container forming an emissive jet, in reaction to which the container may form a missile and cause injury. Another disadvantage of the prior proposal is that it is difficult to equalize the bottom thicknesses of the recesses. Normally the bottom wall is made as thin as 0.3mm so that it readily fractures under the rise in internal pressure. As a result it is unavoidable that some containers have recesses whose bottom walls are relatively thick while others have those which have relatively thin bottom walls. Thus the safe maximum temperature has to be low. A further disadvantage of the prior proposal is that the thin bottom walls of the recesses are liable to corrosion because of a gathering water, such as rain. The corroded bottom is likely to fracture even at normal pressures. The present invention has for its objective to provide a gas container with a safety valve which allows gaseous contents to escape slowly. Another objective of the present invention is to provide a gas container having a high and wide thermal safety range. A further object of the present invention is to provide a gas container capable of easy and economical construction. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a safety gas container permitting gaseous contents to escape slowly at an abnormally elevated temperature, the container being characterised by a valve member made of a shape memory alloy and having a top head and a bottom head with a stem portion with a relatively smaller diameter therebetween, the valve member being fitted in a gas passageway of the container wherein the alloy is made to remember a smaller shape at a specific temperature and whereby the valve is diminished in size in response to a rise in ambient temperature above the specific temperature so that a gap is formed between the stem and the inside of the passageway. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a safety gas container permitting gaseous contents to escape slowly at an abnormally elevated temperature, the container being characterised by a valve member with a stem portion fitted in a gas passageway of the container wherein the valve member is made of a shape memory alloy and is made to remember a smaller shape of a specific temperature so that part of the valve is diminished in size in response to a rise in ambient temperature above the specific temperature, whereby a gap is formed between the stem and the passageway, there being means for preventing removal of the valve from the passageway in response to gaseous pressure. The invention also provides a safety valve arrangement for permitting gas to escape slowly at an abnormally elevated temperature, the arrangement comprising a valve member with a stem portion fitted in and captive relative to a gas passageway characterised in that the valve member is made of a shape memory alloy and is made to remember a different shape at a specific temperature so that part of the valve is diminished in size in response to a rise in ambient temperature above the specific temperature, whereby a gap is formed between the stem and the passageway to allow the slow escape of gas. Figure 3 shows by way of example a typical cylinder type gas container usually having a length of about 130mm and a wall thickness of 1.8mm on average. The body portion 12 has a bottom portion 14 of a hemispheric shape. The container has a round shoulder portion 15 and a neck portion having external threads 19 and an internal gas passageway 16 is produced. After the container has been filled with gas e.g. liquefied carbon dioxide gas a sealing plate 18 is secured e.g. by welding to the outer peripheral edge of the gas passageway 16 thereby to close it. The sealing plate 18 has a thickness of about 0.3mm and has an aperture 5 adapted to allow the gas to escape. The aperture 5 is closed by a valve member 1, which includes a body 2, a stem portion 3 and head portions 4. The valve member 1 itself is made of a shape memory alloy, hereinafter referred to as an SM alloy. The term SM alloy is intended to include all alloys which are capable of remembering their original shapes by virtue of martensite transformation. These alloys have the ability of re assuming their original shapes when they are heated above a specific temperature T The SM alloys herein are not limited to those which are capable of unidirectional shape recovery, but include those which are capable of repeating the shape recovery in response to changes in temperature. The Cu content SM alloys includes those which are especially swageable, and which are adapted for use as a valve by utilising the unidirectional shape memory characteristics. In the present invention a specific temperature T The valve member is cut to such a length and size that the stem fits closely into the aperture 5 in the sealing plate 18, and then the head portions 4 are swaged to provide a means of rendering the valve captive. In this way the valve member 1 is anchored in the sealing plate 18. As seen from Figure 1, the valve member 1 has an I shaped cross section. The aperture 5 is air tightly closed by the double enclosure provided by the stem portion 3 and the head portions 4, which are kept in close contact with the top surfaces 8 and the bottom surfaces 7 of the sealing plate 18. The valve member 1 functions as a plug as shown in Figure 1 so long as the container is at normal temperatures. When the internal temperature rises for some reason or other, for example, when the container is placed in the sunlight for a long time or when a fire breaks out near the container, thereby causing the temperature to rise up to the prescribed temperature T As a result the valve member 1 changes shape as shown in Figure 2, thereby enabling gaps to occur round the stem portion 3 and between the top and bottom surfaces 7, 8 of the sealing plate 18, and the head portions 4. The reference numeral 10 designates a ring shaped gap occurring around the stem portion 3, through gap which gas is allowed to escape. The gap 10 is as narrow, such as less than 0.1mm thereby enabling the contents to discharge at such a small rate as to prevent the container from being propelled in reaction to the discharge. In addition, the direction of discharge is horizontal or perpendicular to the axis of the container as shown in Figure 2. Figure 4 shows another example characterised in that the valve member 1 is fixed to the bottom of the container. Figure 5 shows a further modified version of the embodiment, characterised in that the valve member 1 is fixed to a shoulder 15A of a main valve body 18A screwed to the open end portion of the container. The reference numeral 2A designates a valve member fitted in a pressure escape passageway 5A produced in the main valve 18A. The valve member 2A is also made of a shape memory alloy, and in this example it is an elongated bar whose top and bottom head portions are swaged so that the valve member 2A is air tightly fitted in the pressure escape passageway 5A. When the internal temperature rises up above the prescribed thermal limit, the valve member 2A expands along its length, thereby causing its stem portion 3A to diminish in diameter. Thus the gaseous contents may be discharged slowly through the gap between the stem portion 3A and the inside wall of the pressure escape passageway. As a further example the value member can be fixed to the shoulder portion 15 of the container. As described above, the SM alloys are not limited but can be selected in the wide range of alloys having the shape restoration characteristics. The gas containers include all kinds of containers for holding thermally expansible gases other forms of passageway or other means of anchoring the valve member may be employed.
