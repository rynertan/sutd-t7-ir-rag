## Description
This invention relates to a connector apparatus for electrically connecting a display panel device to a circuit board device. A display panel device can be energised by a circuit on a circuit board device by placing the devices in parallel planes and interconnecting their multiplicity of electrical contacts or conductors that are located near their peripheries. Because of the large number of conductors to be interconnected and their close spacing such as at 7.62 mm 0.030 inch , it is of importance to provide a connector apparatus which is very compact and of low cost, and which provides reliable connection. One known connector apparatus for electrically interconnecting two printed circuit boards or the like is disclosed in US Patent No. 4,199,209 and comprises a plurality of resilient contact elements of serpentine configuration embedded in a body of elastomeric material but having opposite ends thereof exposed to provided contact points for making contact with the printed circuit boards. According to the present invention, however, there is provided a connector apparatus for fitting in the small space between a display panel device and a circuit board device to electrically connect a multiplicity of closely spaced conductors of the display panel device to a multiplicity of corresponding contacts of the circuit board device, the connector apparatus comprising a plurality of resilient contact elements having opposite ends for making contact with the conductors and the contacts, characterised by a housing of electrically insulative material having the shape of an elongated beam that has a centre rib with a largely flat face and at least one flange at each end, each flange having an outer face that bears against one of the devices and an inner face, each flange having a recess in the inner face of the flange which lies adjacent to the rib, and each flange having a row of through openings extending from one face of the flange and through the recess to the other face of the flange a retainer in the form substantially of a plate having opposite sides lying in the recesses and having a face that faces said rib a row of contact elements, each having opposite ends extending through a pair of openings in opposite flanges, and a middle portion, the middle portions of the row of elements lying in substantially a common plane and being nested in each other the middle portions of the elements lying sandwiched between a face of the rib and the face of the retainer. In carrying out the invention the contact elements may be generally v shaped so that the middle portions of the contact elements are out of line with an imaginary line connecting the ends of the elements to provide compression of the elements to allow the ends to resiliently move together and apart and the housing holds the ends of the contact elements in spaced apart relationship along respective row lines by the ends of the contact elements being received by and projecting through openings in flanges of the housing. A connector apparatus in accordance with the invention may form part of a connector assembly including a display pouch device and a circuit board device in closely spaced relationship. The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which FIG. 1 illustrates a display assembly 10 which includes a display panel 12, a circuit board 14, and a group of connector assemblies 16 lying between them. The panel has a large number of conductive traces or conductors 18 on its back face 20, and the circuit board has a large number of corresponding conductors 22 on a face 24 that faces the panel. The display panel and circuit board lie in closely spaced parallel planes, and the connector assemblies 16 are designed to fit into the small space and connect the multiple conductors 18, 22. In this particular arrangement, there are four connector assemblies 16, for connecting each of the four sides of the panel and board devices. As shown in FIG. 3, one embodiment of the connector assembly includes two rows 26, 28 of contact element 30 whose middles lie on row lines 31,33. As shown in FIG. 4, each contact element includes a pair of opposite ends 32, 34 and a middle 36. The opposite ends of each element are aligned, and lie on an imaginary line 38. The middle portion 36 of the element is curved or bent so that it does not lie on the line 38 and is therefore out of line with the ends. The middle portions 36 of the row of contact elements are nested in one another. The nesting is sufficiently close that a middle portion of one element 36a lies on and crosses an imaginary line 38b which connects the opposite ends of another element 36b of the same row. The opposite ends of the elements of one row such as 31 lie on lines 37,39 that are parallel to each other and to the row line 31. The contact elements are formed of sheet metal, by stamping them out of a sheet of resilient conductive material such as phosphor bronze. The thickness of each contact element is constant in a direction perpendicular to both the end connecting line 38 and the row lines 31,33 but varies in a direction perpendicular to the sheet thickness. In other words, as viewed along a row line 31 FIG. 5 , the element has a variable thickness. As viewed along an outside line 41 that is perpendicular to both the row line 31 and the end connecting line 38, the element has a constant thickness. Instead of considerably bending a stamped out contact element, it is already stamped so that the middle portion has a bend, and only minor bending at tab 72 is performed thereon, all of which results in low cost and high uniformity of the contact elements. The spacing of the elements so their middle portions nest in one another enables low cost mounting of the elements in an arrangement that requires very little space. As shown in FIG. 3, the elements are held in position by a housing 42 which includes a beam 44 and a pair of retaining plates 46, 48. The beam 44 includes a central rib 50 and a pair of end plates at its opposite ends which form a pair of flanges 52, 54 on either side. Each flange has an elongated recess 56. The retainers, or retaining plates such as 46, and a row 31 of contact elements, are received in the recess. The rib 50 and a retaining plate 46 form a pair of largely flat surfaces 58, 60. A row of contact elements 30 is sandwiched between the surfaces, to confine the middle portions of the elements so that they and their ends all lie in substantially the same plane such as 62. It should be understood that the rib and plate can have grooves that occupy most of their surfaces, so long as they support the elements to lie in a flat plane. As shown in FIG. 5, each flange such as 52 has a row of through openings 64 through which an end 32 of each element projects. These openings 64 which connect to the recess 56 maintain a predetermined spacing of the elements along the row. The opposite ends of the elements are biased apart so that they project a small distance D FIG. 4 above a corresponding face 66, 68 of the housing before the connector assembly is installed. When a connector assembly is installed between the display panel and circuit board, its opposite faces 66, 68 abut the panel and board to determine their separation. With such installation the ends 32, 34 of the contact elements are defected inwardly by the small amount D until their tips 69 are even with the opposite faces 66, 68. A cover spring 70 which fits around the edges of the panel and circuit board, presses them tightly together against opposite sides of the connector assembly. The contact elements can be formed with tabs 72 with FIG. 5 that are received in grooves 74, to limit the up and down movement of the middle portions of the contact assemblies, to insure that they do not touch one another. Although the contact elements are closely spaced along each row, the use of two rows, with the contact elements in staggered positions along the rows, permits the connection of traces or conductors on a display panel and a circuit board, that are very closely spaced, while permitting somewhat greater spacing of the contact elements along each row. A system has been designed to connect conductors on a display panel and circuit board that were spaced a distance F FIG. 4 apart of 0,75 mm . Contact elements formed of sheet metal, were used with only the tabs 72 bent out of the plane out of the sheet metal of which they were formed. The distance G between the ends of the elements was 7mm, and each element projected a distance D of 0,25 mm prior to its installation. FIG. 6 and 7 illustrate some details of another embodiment of the invention that was designed prior to that of FIGS. 1 6. In the connector assembly of FIG. 6 and 7, the contact elements 82 also have middle portions 83 that are nested in one another, so that an entire row of contact elements lie substantially in one plane. While the contact elements 82 were formed from sheet metal, their opposite ends 84, 85 were bent out of the common plane 87 of most of the element. Such bent ends were provided in order that they may be captured in a retainer plate 86 which had slots 88 which received the ends of the elements. The retainer plate 86 was fastened at its opposite ends to a center beam 90, and was also held by elastomeric cement at its middle portions to the beam. Thus, the invention provides a connector assembly for interconnecting the conductors or traces of a pair of boards or panels, which is of high reliability and low cost. The connector assembly includes at least one row of contact elements with bent middle portions that permit resilient compression of the opposite ends, and means for holding the contact elements in rows so that the middle portions of the contact elements are nested in one another. The contact elements can be held by a housing which includes a pair of largely flat surfaces, with the contact elements sandwiched between them. The housing can be formed by a beam having opposite sides that abut against the panel or board devices, and a retainer plate lying beside the beam , with the elements sandwiched between them. The contact elements can be formed of sheet metal, with most of the element lying flat in the plane of the sheet metal, and with each contact element originally punched out of a sheet of metal so that it originally had a bent middle portion.
