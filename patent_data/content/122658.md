## Description
METHOD FOR THE SEPARATE RECOVERY OF METALS FROM WASTEIN PARTICULAR CHEMICAL WASTEThe applicant names as inventors Ir. Arend Bolt of GeldropDr. Ir. Wilhelmus J. Th. van Gemert of ApeldoornIng. Bernhard A. Kamphuis of BaarnProf. Ir. Martinus Tels of EindhovenThe invention relates to a method for the separate recovery of metals such as chromium, zinc, cadmium, nickel from iron containing waste, especially chemical waste, in which the waste is treated with an acid, whereby an aqueous solution 1 and a residue are obtained.In this connection, by chemical waste is understood waste materials which are recognized as chemical waste by the laws of any country and for which there are restrictions concerning the disposal of such waste.The invention relates in particular to the disposal of this chemical waste. The invention is not limited to this however. The invention can be also in general applied to the processing of waste or waste materials , for instance a waste product or by product of a process, which is not waste within the meaning of the law but which is a metal containing mixture which in any case contains iron, and from which the separate recovery of metals is rational. In particular the invention relates to waste originating from the electroplating and pickling industries. The method is however also applicable to waste from other origins such as harbour or dock sludge. The method may even be applied to waste in the form of e.g. dust. As a rule the waste undergoes a pre treatment in which the metals in the waste are concentrated.After the pre treatment the waste often takes the form of a metal containing sludge. It is known, as the first step in the recovery of metals, to treat the chemical waste with acid. The aim here is to obtain an aqueous solution containing the ions of the metal, and a residue which is not chemical waste within the meaning of the law and which can be freely disposed of. The preferred acid is the cheap sulphuric acid. Known methods for the separate recovery of metals are liquid liquid extraction called extraction in the following and ion exchange.Mostly, the chemical waste contains significant quantities of iron, and although iron is not chemical waste within the meaning of the law it goes partially into solution during the dissolution treatment. The iron which is dissolved interferes with the separate recovery of other metals and must therefore be removed. It is known to remove iron III selectively from an aqueous solution by extraction using MIBK methylisobutyl ketone as the extraction medium. This extraction has the following difficulties. Firstly the extraction is only possible from a solution containing much hydrochloric acid.The hydrochloric acid must, after the recovery of other metals from the hydrochloric solution, 1 be recovered by distillation or 2 be neutralised whereby expensive hydrochloric acid is lost and much salt is produced for the disposal of which a levy must be paid both methods carry large extra costs. Secondly, when MIBK is used much of this extraction medium is lost due to its high solubility in the aqueous solution.If the waste also contains lead, it is necessary to use another acid such as hydrochloric or nitric acid, in place of the sulphuric acid, since the use of sulphuric acid leaves an unacceptable quantity of lead sulphate in the residue as a result of its poor solubility.When hydrochloric acid is chosen there remains the above mentioned second difficulty, with MIBK, of the loss of this extraction material in the aqueous solution.A further problem with lead is that, during the recovery of other metals in an anion exchanger, this metal diffuses. The metals recovered in an anion exchanger are therefore heavily contaminated with lead.The separate recovery of chromium also poses a problem.When an anion exchanger is employed, chromium III passes through the exchanger, while during extraction of chromium IV zinc and cadmium are co extracted.The object of the invention is to provide a solution of the above mentioned difficulties and hence improve known methods.This is achieved in the invention by selectively extracting the iron III from the solution 1 at a pH of 0 1 using an organophosphoric acid as extraction medium 1 , and by recovering other metals separately too.The advantage of this is that in this way iron can be extracted selectively from the aqueous solution with a partition coefficient of about 1000, with not more than a very slight loss of extraction medium.It is remarked that it is known from DE 2503398 to extract iron and zinc together froman acid sulphate solution with an organophosphoric acid as extraction medium. What is not known is how to use this extraction medium to extract iron present as Foe 3 selectively from an acid solution by controlling the pH accurately to a value between 0 and 1, whereby the aqueous medium is not bound to sulphuric acid. Preferably di 2 ethylhexylphosphoric acid dissolved in a suitable organic solvent is used as extraction medium. The regeneration of this extraction medium with sulphuric acid, as described in DE 2503398 is not efficient, and hence the iron is preferably back extracted from the extraction medium using a strong, e.g. 6 M, HC1 solution. A further improvement consists in subjecting the chromium III in the solution 2 to oxidation treatment using an oxidising agent such as sodium hypochlorite aC10 at a pH of 2 4, in selectively extracting the chromium VI so formed from the solution at a pH of 2.5 4 using a suitable extraction medium III and in removing co extracted cadmium and zinc from the charged extraction medium III before back extraction of the chromium IV by washing with a wash liquid such as a sodium sulphate solution with a pH of about 3 the advantage of this is that the Cr VI to be recovered is hardly contaminated with cadmium and zinc. In another aspect the object of the invention is achieved by the combination of the following steps a. treatment of the waste with an acid, whereby an aqueous solution I and a residue are obtained b. selective extraction of the iron III from solution 1 at a pH of 0 1 using an organophosphoric acid as extraction medium I c 2. oxidative treatment of the chromium III in solution 2 at a pH of 2 4 using an oxidising agent, such as sodium hypochlorite NaC10 , and c 3. selective extraction of the chromium VI formed from the solution at a pH of 2.5 4 using a suitable extraction medium III and the removal of Co extracted cadmium and zinc from the charged extraction medium III by washing it with a wash liquid, such as a sodium sulphate solution at a pH of 3, before back extraction of the chromium Vi . A further improvement is achieved by the following step e. extraction of zinc, cadmium and nickel together from the solution 4 at a pH of 6 7 using a suitable extraction medium V . The solution 4 , when zinc, cadmium and nickel have been removed, can be disposed of. The zinc, cadmium and nickel can finally be recovered separately by the three following steps f. back extraction of the extraction medium V charged in step e at a pH of less than 5 using an aqueous solution which contains about 5 mol l of NaCl g. fixing zinc and cadmium from solution 6 on a strongly basic anion exchanger followed by successive elution of zinc and cadmium with 0.02 M HC1 and water respectively and h. extraction from solution 7 of the nickel which has passed unhindered through the anion exchanger during the fixing at step g by the use of a suitable extraction medium VI at a pH of 6 7. Particular embodiments of the method of the invention for the case where the chemical waste also contains cobalt, manganese copper or lead are given in subclaims.The invention will be illustrated non restrictively with reference to the drawing.Fig. 1 shows a process diagram for the separate recovery of metals from chemical waste in accordance with the invention. Fig. 2 shows in detail the step, indicated in Fig.1 by a, of selective extraction of iron III and shows an embodiment of the extraction process.Fig. 3 shows in detail the step, indicated in Fig 1 by c 3, of selective extraction of chromium VI and shows an embodiment of the extraction process.In Fig. 1 reference numeral 1 shows the supply of mixed metal containing sludges to a solution step a. An acid is introduced by a supply 2.The sludge is dissolved in an acid suitable for the purpose so that the pH of a solution 1 obtained reaches a final value of between 0 and 1. Sulphuric acid is preferably used since it is cheap and since when sulphuric acid is used calcium for the most part does not go into solution. If however there is much lead present in the sludge so that the residue obtained from the solution step a through the discharge 3 would not conform with the legal standards, use is made of hydrochloric or nitric acid.Since in the solution step a the rentals cited in theChemical Waste Law Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, Cd, Co and Pb go into solution with an efficiency of more than 99 together with a quantity of iron and manganese, a residual sludge is obtained which is not a chemical waste within the meaning of the Chemical Waste Law, together with a solution 1 which contains the metals cited. Since iron will interfere during the separate recovery of the metals from the solution, the iron is first removed from the solution 1 obtained at step a.For this purpose solution 1 is brought to a step b, at which the iron is removed selectively from solution 1 . This can be achieved by means of liquid liquid extraction in which an organo phosphoric acid is used as extraction medium I . For example a 20 solution of di 2 ethylhexylphosphoric acid D2EHPA in a suitable organic solvent is suitable.The stripping regeneration of the organic extraction medium charged with iron and zinc by means of sulphuric acid, as described in DE 2503398, is not effective.For an effective regeneration of the charged extraction medium the following method is employed see Fig.2 . The charged extraction medium is subjected to a subsequent liquid liquid extraction step, in which the aqueous phase consists of a 6 M HC1 solution.The iron thus goes over into the aqueous phase, from which it can be removed by a known technique, for instance by means of liquid liquid extraction using a solvating extraction medium II such as methylisobutyl ketone MIBK or tributyl phosphate TSP .The iron free hydrochloric solution is after recuperation re used for the regeneration of the extraction medium I .The iron extraction is shown schematically in Fig.2.In addition, an embodiment is given, in which n number of equilibrium stages q organic water phase ratio by volumeD partition coefficient concentration of metal in organic phase concentration of metal in aqueous phase The other numbers in Fig. 2 are iron concentrations g l in the relevant flows in the embodiment. The extraction media in the example are Extraction medium I 20 D2EHPA in kerosineExtraction medium II 10 TBP in kerosine.By selecting favourable phase ratios the resultant iron chloride solution can be highly concentrated. In the example by a factor 25 relative to the original solution .Zinc is extracted only to the extent of 1 in the first step, and the other non ferrous metals remain below that.The solution 2 obtained at step b is, as shown inFig. 1, brought to a process step c, in which theCr III present is oxidised to Cr VI in an oxidation step c 2 using sodium hypochlorite, in which the pH should lie between 2 and 4. The chromium in its hexavalent form can be removed selectively from the solution.The removal of the chromium is necessary since it will interfere with the subsequent process stepsThe manganese which may be present as Nun 2 in solution 2 is deposited as manganese dioxide MnO2 as a result of the oxidising treatment in oxidation step c 2 and is then filtered off.If lead is also present in solution 2 it is possible to prevent the insoluble lead chromate 2 from being deposited along with the manganese dioxide by treating the solution 2 at a step c l with sodium chromate, so that the lead chromate can be filtered off before the oxidisation treatment in step c 2 takes place. The Cr VI formed is removed selectively from the solution in step c 3 using liquid liquid extraction.For this purpose it is possible to use basic extraction media known per se such as primary, secondary and tertiary amines, and also quaternary ammonium salts.A mixture of trioctylamine and tributyl phosphate TOA TBP is especially suitable for this purpose.During the extraction of Cr VI at an equilibrium pH of between 2.5 and 4 small quantities of zinc and cadmium are co extracted. At this point, see Fig.3, by treating the charged extraction medium III in a subsequent extraction step with sodium sulphate solution at pH 3, the co extractedd zinc and cadmium are selectively washed from extraction medium III .The Cr VI is back extracted from the charged extraction medium III using an aqueous solution at a pH between 6 and 9. By using this aqueous solution several times for this purpose a highly concentrated sodium chromate solution is obtained. The regenerated extraction medium III so obtained is re used for the extraction of the Cr VI without further post treatment. TheCr VI extraction is reproduced schematically inFig. 3.An embodiment is also given in which n and q have the same significance as in Fig. 2. In the embodiment the extraction medium III is TOA TBP 50 100 g l in kerosine.For the conditions indicated in Fig. 3, the following partition in the various flows applies 2 3 W pRelative volume 1 1 0.25 0.10CR 71 1.00 0.001 9.99Zn 1.00 0.92 0.318 0.006Cd 1.00 0.88 0.476 0.01Zinc and cadmium are very strongly co extracted, but can be washed out effectively using a sulphate solution.By partially recycling the product flow P, it is possible to obtain a reducing concentration of the sodium chromate solution.In a subsequent process step d, Cm2 is selectively removed from the solution 3 obtained at step c by means of liquid liquid extraction at a pH between 4 and 5.5. The copper charged extraction medium IV is stripped regenerated using sulphuric acid to obtain a highly concentrated copper sulphate solution. The solution 4 obtained in step d plus the wash water from step c 3 contains ions of zinc, cadmium, nickel and cobalt. These metal ions are extracted at step e from solution 4 using extraction medium V by carrying out the extraction in a number of equilibrium steps at a pH between 6 and 7. The aqueous solution 5 so obtained contains no more heavy metals and can be disposed of.The extraction medium V obtained at step e and charged with Sn2 , Cud2 , Ni2 and Co2 is stripped regenerated in step f at a pH of less than 5 using an aqueous solution containing 5 mol l NaCl. In this, the abovementioned metal ions go over into the aqueous solution 6 .By passing this solution 6 over a strongly basic anion exchanger the ions of zinc, cadmium and cobalt are fixed on the anion exchanger at step g, while Ni2 passes through unhindered. Co2 , Zn2 and Cd 2 are washed separately from the anion exchanger by successive elution with about 0.5 M H , about 0.02M HQ and water. Nickel is finally extracted from the salt solution 7 at step h at a pH of between 6 and 7 using extraction medium VI . The nickel charged extraction medium VI is stripped with sulphuric acid.The resultant salt solution 8 can afterwards be brought back to strength and used again for stripping the extraction medium V charged in step e.A mixture of cyclohexanoxime and an unsaturated fatty acid such as e.g. oleic acid in an arbitrary organic solvent is especially suitable for the extraction media IV , V and VI .
