# Bronze suppression in an alkali metal sulphur ammoniate battery.

## Abstract
A battery employing an alkali metal sulfur electroche mical reaction pair in an anhydrous ammonia electrolyte environment including an anolyte and method for suppres sing formation of a bronze between the ammonia and the metal and a method for making the anolyte. The anolyte includes a bronze suppressing, conductivity enhancing salt of the alkali metal and a bronze suppressing aromatic organic dissolved in the anhydrous ammonia.
