# AUTOMATIC REGISTRATION CONTROL SYSTEM FOR COLOR TELEVISION CAMERAS

## Abstract
A system or automatically setting up a color television camera. Register error is detected by correlating the times of occurrence of level transitions in two video signals. A unipolar pulse is provided in response to a level transition in one of the video signals, and a pulse having a positive and a negative lobe is provided in response to a level transition in the other of the video signals. The two pulse signals are multipled. The product of the two pulse signals is integrated to produce a signal whose amplitude and polarity varies with register error. A mi croprocessor control system detects size and centering er rors by measuring register error at different spots on the ras ter. Before correcting setup errors, the microprocessor veri fies that there are adequate level transitions in the imaged scene by methodically adjusting the setup controls over a range of values and noting whether the measured register or size errors change accordingly.
