# An apparatus for compensating a quantization error.

## Abstract
An apparatus for compensating for a quantization error having a time detector circuit 30 for detecting a time signal on the basis of the number of clock signals CLK which arrive within the time period thereof, a quantization error detector circuit 40 for making a quantization error time corresponding to a time difference between the time signal and the clock signal as an analogue voltage value, and a compensator circuit 50 for compensating for a digital detected time derived from the time detector circuit 30 on the basis of an analogue quantization error time from the quantization error detector circuit 40 .
