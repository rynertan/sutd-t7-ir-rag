# SOFT TOP STACKABLE PACKAGE

## Abstract
A stackable package for protecting edible food product contents is formed by a flexible bag attached inside a rela tively rigid box. The box is open on only side, through which extends a reclosable end of the flexible bag. The reclosable end begins to taper just above the open box edge, so that the box does not impede opening. The package, when placed on its side, is stackable in that it can support other boxes on a side opposing that side upon which the box rests. The flexible bag may be foil lined to act as a moisture barrier to protect freshness.
