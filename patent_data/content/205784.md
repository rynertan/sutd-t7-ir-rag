## Description
The invention relates to a solid state cell employing a solid cathode of MoS₃ along with MnO₂ and or Sb₂S₃. Ionic conductivity is usually associated with the flow of ions through a liquid solution of salts. In the vast majority of practical uses of ionic conductors, i.e., as electrolytes for dry cell batteries, the liquid solution is immobilized in the form of a paste or gelled matrix or is absorbed in a separator to overcome the difficulties associated with handling and packaging a liquid. However, even after immobilization, the system is still subject to possible leakage, has a limited shelf life due to drying out or crystallization of the salts and is suitable for use only within a limited temperature range corresponding to the liquid range of the electrolyte. In addition, the use of a large volume of immobilizing material has hindered the aims of miniaturization. In attempting to overcome the shortcomings of the liquid systems, investigators have surveyed a large number of solid compounds hoping to find compounds which are solid at room temperature and have ionic conductances approaching those exhibited by the commonly used liquid systems. Such compounds have specific conductances at room temperature 20 C. in the range of 10 ² to 10 ¹⁵ ohm ¹ cm ¹ as compared to aqueous solutions of salts which typically have a specific conductance of 0.5 to 0.05 ohm ¹ cm ¹. Improved microelectronic circuit designs have generally decreased the current requirements for electronic devices. This in turn has enhanced the applicability of solid electrolyte power sources which usually can only deliver currents in the microampere range. These solid electrolyte systems have the inherent advantages of being free of electrolyte leakage and internal gassing problems due to the absence of a liquid phase and corrosion phenomena. In addition, they also have a much longer shelf life than the conventional liquid electrolyte power sources. Gutman et al, J. Electrochem. Soc., U.S. Patent 4,377,624 discloses cathodes comprising one or more metal chalcogenides wherein the ionic and electronic conductivity of the metal chalcogenides ranges between 10 ¹⁰ to 10 ² ohm ¹ cm ¹ at room temperature. U.S. Patent 4,086,404 describes a method of preparing active electrode material for loading into porous electrically conductive substrates. Examples of contemplated active materials recited in this reference include the chalcogenides, i.e. the oxides, sulfides and selenides of metal such as iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, lead, zinc, antimony, and manganese. U.S. Patent 4,385,103 discloses the use of a cathode comprising Sb₂S₃ in a physical mixture with a carbonaceous conductor for cells employing organic solvents. U.S. Patent 3,959,012 discloses the use of a metal chalcogenide, such as Sb₂S₃, in conjunction with a metal halide in order to form a suitable cathode for solid electrolyte cells. Although various solid cathode materials are recited in the art for use in various cell systems, an object of the present invention is to provide a novel cathode for use in solid electrolyte cell systems employing solid electrolytes such as P₂S₅ Li₂S LiI as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,331,750 and LiI Li₂S SiS₂ as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,465,746. The disclosure in U.S. Patents 4,331,750 and 4,465,746 are incorporated herein by reference. Another object of the present invention is to provide a solid state cathode for solid state cell systems in which the cathode comprises MoS₃ molybdenum trisulfide in conjunction with MnO₂ manganese dioxide and or Sb₂S₃ antimony trisulfide . The foregoing and additional objects will become more fully apparent from the following description. The invention relates to a solid state cell employing an anode, a solid electrolyte and a solid cathode comprising MoS₃ in conjunction with a material selected from the group consisting of MnO₂, SB₂S₃ and mixtures thereof. The MoS₃ material for use in this invention is preferably amorphous MoS₃. Cathode limited lithium test cells employing an electrolyte of 1,3 dioxolane, 1,2 dimethoxyethane, 3 methyl 2 oxazolidone, 3,5 dimethylisoxazole, and LiCF₃SO₃ added salt and an amorphous MoS₃ cathode was discharged across a 10 kohm load. The cathode was found to be electro active and capable of discharge approaching the 3 electron MoS₃ level at 0.2 mA cm² to a 1.2 volt cutoff. Compatible cells were produced using crystalline MoS₃ in place of the amorphous MoS₃ and when the cells were discharged across a load, the crystalline MoS₃ cathode displayed very limited electro activity in an nonaqueous system. Therefore it is believed that amorphous MoS₃ would also perform much better in solid state electrolyte systems and thus the preferred embodiment of this invention would use amorphous MoS₃ rather than crystalline MoS₃. The MoS₃ material can be prepared thermally by decomposition of NH₄ ₂MoS₄ ammonium thiomolybdate as is generally known in the art. The MoS₃ can be mixed with MnO₂ and or Sb₂S₃ to form a homogeneous mixture. Preferably, the cathode materials should be mixed with some solid electrolyte, a conductive agent such as graphite, carbon or the like and a binder such as Teflon trademark for polytetrafluoroethylene , ethylene acrylic acid copolymer or the like. If desired TiS₂ titanium disulfide , while having electrochemical activity, can be incorporated into the cathode to serve as a conductor, binder, or molding aid. Thus, TiS₂ can be employed as the conductive agent and or binder of the cathode. Anode materials suitable for use with the solid cathode of this invention include lithium, lithium alloys, silver, sodium, potassium, and rubidium. The preferred anode material are lithium and lithium alloys. Solid electrolytes suitable for use with the solid cathode of this invention include the conductive vitreous cathode compositions disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,331,750 and the compositions disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,465,746. The solid cathodes disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,331,750 have the general formula aP₂S₅,bLi₂S, cLiX where X represents chlorine, bromine or iodine c is greater than or equal to 0 the ratio b a b lies between 0.61 and 0.70 and the ratio c a b c is less than or equal to a limit which corresponds to solubility in the vitreous phase of LiX in the composition aP₂S₅, bLi₂S. The solid electrolytes disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,465,746 have the general formula SiS₂ xLi₂S, yLiI where x is from 0.8 to 1.5, y is from 0 to about 2, and wherein said composition has a conductivity of at least 0.75 x 10 ⁴ ohm ¹ cm ¹ at 25 C. Also suitable solid electrolytes for use in this invention are the solid vitreous lithium cation conductors of the composition aX,bLi₂S, Y where X is selected from the group consisting of P₂S₅ and SiS₂ a is from about 0.5 to about 3 b is from 0.25 to 2 and Y is an oxygen containing lithium compound such as Li₂CO₃, Li₂O, LiOH, Li₂SiO₃, Li₂SO₄ and Li₄SiO₄ and wherein said composition has a conductivity of at least 0.75 x 10 ⁴ ohm ¹ cm ¹ at 25 C. These solid cathodes are disclosed in a copending U.S. Patent Application, Serial Number ........, filed on ...... in the name of James Robert Akridge. The disclosure in this U.S. patent application is incorporated herein by reference. Additional solid electrolytes suitable for use in this invention are the vitreous material disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,513,070, said U.S. Patent being incorporated herein by reference. The vitreous materials forming the solid electrolytes have a general formula xA The preferred solid electrolytes are 2.5LiI Li₄P₂S₇, 0.75LiI Li₂SiS₃, 0.1875Li₂CO₃ Li₂SiS₃, 0.25LiBr 0.1875Li₂CO₃ Li₂SiS₃, 0.375Li₂O Li₂SiS₃, 0.75LiOH Li₂SiS₃, 0.5LiBr 0.375Li₂CO₃ Li₂SiS₃, and 0.375Li₂SiO₃ Li₂SiS₃. The most preferred solid electrolytes are 2.5LiI Li₄P₂S₇ and 0.75LiI Li₂SiS₃. It is believed that some forms of solid electrolytes would not perform in an acceptable manner in conjunction with the solid cathode of this invention. For example, β Al₂O₃ should not be employed in cells that are expected to operate at ambient temperature unless a liquid alloy metal or a layer of organic liquid electrolyte is used between the anode and the β Al₂O₃ reference In assembling the components of the cell of this invention, it is preferable to use the isostatic compression technique disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,477,545, said U.S Patent being incorporated herein by reference. Several 0.787 inch diameter by 0.063 inch high coin cells were constructed. The cell has a cathode as shown in the Table along with a solid electrolyte of 2.5 LiI Li₄P₂S₇ and a lithium anode. The cells were all constructed the same except for the composition of the cathode materials which are shown in the Table. The MoS₃ component of the cathode composition was amorphous. Each cell was isostatically compressed at 80,000 psi, except for cell D which was isostatically compressed at 54,000 psi, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,477,545. The milli ampere hour input for each cell was calculated and is shown in the Table. The cells were continuously discharged across a 50 kohm load at 21 C or across a 30 kohm at 32 C. The milli ampere hour output to 1.2 volt cutoff was observed and the data are shown in the Table. Cathode utilization, which is determined by dividing the cathode output by the cathode input and then multiplying by 100, was calculated for each cell and the data obtained are shown in the Table. When the cathode composition MnO₂ of Cell A was combined with the cathode composition MoS₃ of Cell B and Teflon was added, a cathode composition MnO₂ MoS₃ was produced as shown in the Table for Cell C. The milli ampere hour output to a 1.2 volt cutoff increased from 7.3 mAh for Cell B to 57.0 mAh for Cell C. This drastic increase demonstrates the synergistic effect obtained when using the combination of MnO₂ and amorphous MoS₃ as a solid cathode in accordance with this invention. In a like manner when the cathode composition MoS₃ of Cell B was combined with the cathode composition Sb₂S₃ of Cell D to produce the cathode composition MoS₃ Sb₂S₃ of Cell E, the milli ampere hour output to a 1.2 volt cutoff increased from 21.4 mAh for Cell D to 48.0 mAh for Cell E. This drastic increase again demonstrates the synergistic effect obtained using the combination of amorphous MoS₃ and Sb₂S₃ as a solid cathode in accordance with this invention. Cell F was made identical to Cell E but was discharged across a 30 kohm load at a temperature of 32 C. The milli ampere output observed for Cell F was the same as that observed for Cell E even though Cell F was discharged at a higher temperature. It should be understood that the foregoing disclosure relates to preferred embodiments of the invention and it is intended to cover all changes and modifications of the invention which do not depart from the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
