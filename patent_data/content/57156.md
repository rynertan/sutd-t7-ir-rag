# Air reject gate.

## Abstract
A gate station incorporates air pressure flows to direct clips in a production stream through the station and to selectively divert defective clips into a separate reject steam. Mounted on a support plate 30 in the station are an upstream manifold 23 , continuously supplied with low pressure air, and a downstream manifold 25 , having a plurality of downwardly directed air ports 38 and selectively supplied with high pressure air. Air flow from the upstream manifold 23 is directed laterally over the upper surface of a clip so as to enable atmospheric pressure to maintain the clip traveling through the gate station in the production stream. If a clip is to be diverted, the downstream manifold 25 is injected with high pressure air causing blasts of high velocity air through the downwardly directed ports. This high velocity air disrupts the flow from the upstream manifold and forces the leading edge of the defective clip downwards, pressing the clip into the reject stream.
