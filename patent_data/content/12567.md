# Fuel injection fuel flow control system.

## Abstract
A fuel injection control system for an internal combus tion engine having a fuel pump that has a fuel flow output that varies as a direct function of engine speed, an air fuel ratio controller 100 that has a mechanical linkage that varies the output of pump as a function of changes in engine intake ma nifold vacuum acting on an aneroid 122 to maintain a con stant air fuel ratio to the engine mixture charge, and a linkage type regulator with five vacuum controlled motors 156,170, 178, 186 and 190 , that modify the position of the regulator 100 in a step wise progressive and sequential manner to es tablish exhaust gas recirculation EGR and to change fuel flow to compensate for the change in oxygen concentration in the mixture charge due to EGR flow and other engine op erating conditions as well as engine operating temperature changes.
