# Infusion pump with disposable cassette.

## Abstract
An infusion pump incorporates a cassette 12 formed by bonding of two substantially flat sheets. The fluid to be infused to the patient comes into contact only with the cassette 12 . The sheets define a pumping chamber 38 therebetween. The infusion pump is provided with a pump ing member having a hub 60 and a plurality of petal shaped sections 62 extending radially outward therefrom and pivoted relative thereto. A stepping motor 80 can be operated to move the pumping member against the second flexible sheet to decrease the volume of the pumping chamber 38 and pump fluid to the patient. A load cell 82 monitors the force exerted by the stepping motor 80 on the hub 60 . An outlet restriction valve 58 is electronically controlled by a second stepping motor 102 in response to the pressure sensed by the load cell 82 to control pumping to a predetermined pressure. The pressure can be selectively varied which permits the use of a low pressure at low flow rates to decrease the time necessary to detect an occlusion in the output line.
