## Description
CLEANING DEVICE This invention relates to a cleaning device, and particularly to a cleaning device comprising a work head carried by a handle which incorporates a reservoir for a cleaning liquid to be dispensed by way of the work head during use of the device. Such a device is known in which the handle is hollow and constitutes the reservoir, there being a discharge hole from the reservoir, by way of which cleaning liquid contained in the reservoir can leave the reservoir and enter the work head which is detachably mounted on one end of the handle over the discharge hole in the reservoir. In the known device the work head comprises a sponge like member which is compressed during use of the device, such compression serving to draw cleaning liquid from the reservoir through the discharge hole which is open at all times, the reservoir being otherwise sealed in air tight manner. For certain cleaning operations, for example cleaning lavatory bowls, it is necessary to use a device having a work head in the form of a brush, the use of any sponge like member on the work head being impractical for reasons of hygiene. Thus, a known cleaning device as discussed above is not suitable for such certain cleaning operations since cleaning liquid could leak from the reservoir through the discharge hole when the device is not in use, particularly in the case of devices for cleaning lavatory bowls, which are normally kept in a vertical position, work head down, when not in use. According to this invention there is provided a cleaning device comprising a work head carried by a handle which incorporates a reservoir for a cleaning liquid to be dispensed by way of the work head during use of the device, in which the reservoir communicates with the work head by way of a normally closed discharge valve which is opened on application of the work head to a surface to be cleaned. The device of this invention has the advantage that cleaning liquid can leave the reservoir only when the discharge valve xs open, the valve being automatically opened during use of the device to allow cleaning liquid to pass to the work head as required.Further, the device can be kept in work head down condition when not in use without any leakage of clean ing liquid from the reservoir occuring. Two cleaning devices according to this invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side view of either device Figure 2 is a sectional view through the work head end of a first device in a first condition Figure 3 is a view similar to Figure 2 but with the first device in a second condition and Figure 4 is a sectional view through the work head end of the second device. Referring to Figures 1, 2 and 3, the cleaning device comprises a work head 1 carried by a handle 2 which also constitutes a reservoir for a cleaning liquid 3 to be dispensed by the work head 1 during use of the device. The handle 2 is a hollow elongate transparent member moulded from high tensile polyvinylchloride, having an open end 4 by which the liquid 3 can be introduced into the handle 2, the open end 4 being closed after introduction of the liquid 3, by a cap 5 which is in screw thread engagement with the handle 2. The other end 6 of the handle 2 terminates in an enlarged circular cross section portion 6 closed by an end wall 7 having a valve member 8 mounted at its centre. The work head 1 comprises a plastics material moulding providing a resilient diaphragm 9 having a plurality of bristle members 10 projecting from one surface. The diaphragm 9 is formed with an upstanding peripheral flange 11 by which the work head I can be mounted on the end portion 6 of the handle 2 in a clip on arrangement. The valve 8 consists of a body member 12 secured in a hole in the wall 7 of the handle reservoir 2, and a plunger member 13 comprising a stem carrying at one end a closure member which co operates with a hole in the body member 12 to provide the valve action, and carrying at the other end an enlarged head by which the plunger member 13 is connected to the diaphragm 9. The arrangement is such that when the device is not in use the diaphragm 9 of the work head 1 is bowed outwardly as shown in Figure 2, and serves to hold the valve 8 in a normally closed condition with the enlarged head on the stem closing the hole in the body member. When the device is used the bristle members are engaged with an object to be cleaned, and the engagement pressure causes the diaphragm 9 to be distorted inwardly as shown in Figure 3. This distortion of the diaphragm causes the plunger member 13 of the valve 8 to be moved relative to the body member 12 thereof such that the enlarged head of the plunger member is lifted out of the hole in the body member whereby cleaning liquid 3 can flow from the handle reservoir 2 into the space between the diaphragm 9 and the wall 7 of the handle reservoir 2, and from there through holes in the diaphragm 9 to be discharged between the bristle members 10 as required. The discharge flow of the cleaning liquid 3 is indicated by arrows inFigure 3. when cleaning is finished and the bristles 10 are disengaged from the object being cleaned the diaphragm 9 reverts to its outwardly bowed condition as shown in Figure 2, thereby closing the valve 8 to prevent loss of liquid from the handle reservoir 2. Referring now to Figure 4, parts of the device here shown corresponding to parts of the device of Figures 2 and 3 have been given the same reference numerals. In this second device the valve 8 again comprises a body member 12 secured in a hole in the wall 7 of the handle reservoir 2, and a plunger member 13 comprising a stem carrying at one end a closure member which eo operates with a hole in the body member 12 to provide the valve action. The stem of the plunger member 13 is relatively long and projects through the diaphragm 9 of the work head 1 to terminate adjacent the free ends of the bristle members 10. The valve 8 is completed by a spring member 14 acting between the plunger member 13 and the body member 12 to hold the valve 8 in a normally closed condition as shown in Figure 4. In use of this second device, engagement of the bristle members 10 with an object to be cleaned also brings the stem of the plunger member 13 of the valve 8 into engagement with the object, the plunger member 13 thus being moved relative to the body member 12 of the valve 8, against the action of the spring member 14, to open the valve member 8 and allow cleaning liquid 3 from the handle reservoir 2 to discharge from the device, as described for the device of Figures 2 and 3. when cleaning is finished and the work head 1 is disengaged from the object being cleaned, the spring member 14 will return the valve 8 to its closed condition thereby preventing any further discharge of cleaning liquid 3 from the device. Either of the devices described above can be kept in a vertical position with the work head 1 at the bottom, when not in use, without leakage of cleaning liquid 3 occuring, since when the device is not in use the valve 8 is maintained in the closed condition either by the diaphragm 9 in the device of Figures 1, 2, and 3, or by the spring member 14 in the device of Figures 1 and 4. The use of a clip on work head 1 as described gives the advantage that when necessary a used work head 1 can be removed from the handle reservoir 2 and discarded, to be replaced by a new work head 1. In view of the material from which it is made, the handle reservoir 2 can be sterilized by boiling when the work head 1 has been removed. A new work head 1 can be provided in a package which, after removal of the new work head 1 therefrom, can be used to remove the old work head 1 from the device such that contact with the old work head 1 can be avoided in the interests of hygiene.
