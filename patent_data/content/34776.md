# Diagnostic circuit for PCM connection networks.

## Abstract
A diagnostic circuit for PCM connection networks com prises a selector MX followed by a series to parallel conver ter SP , designed to select the PCM group containing the channel to be tested, and to transfer in parallel the eight bits of the channel to the network control processor, and a logic network RL that decodes messages and commands coming from the processor and controls the bit pick up and transfer in correspondance with a predetermined frame. The whole cir cuit is manufactured as an integrated circuit and is suitable for direct dialogue with a microprocessor.
