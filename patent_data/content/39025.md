The invention also concerns photopolymerizable compositions containing the sensitizers of Formula I.The photopolymerizable compositions of this invention comprise a combination of i at least one nongaseous ethylenically unsaturated compound capable of forming a high molecular weight polymer by photo initiated addition polymerization ii at least one 2,4,5 triarylimidazolyl dimer initiator consisting of two 2,4,5 triaryl imidazolyl radicals bound together by a single covalent bond and iii at least one a, unsaturated ketone sensitizer of formula I.For practical considerations, it is preferred to employ a compound i which has a boiling point above 100 CC at normal atmospheric pressure. The photopolymerizable compositions can contain a polymeric binder to improve strength or to improve or effect adherence to a substrate. The relative concentrations of elements i , ii , and iii , and the binder are as follows.

The sensitizer, iii , is present in an amount of about 0.001 to 15 parts per 100 parts of the combined weight of i and binder, more preferably at about 1.0 to 10 parts per 100 parts. The photopolymerizable compositions of this invention can contain other additives in addition to binders. The types and amounts of such additives will be obvious to those skilled in the art. Several types of additives will be described hereafter. Preparation of Sensitizers When R7 Is A The sensitizers are prepared by reacting the known 9,10 dihydro 9,10 ethanoanthracene or 9,10dihydro 9,10 propanoanthracene with acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride in the presence of aluminum chloride to obtain as an intermediate the corresponding 2 acetyl or 2,6 7 diacetyl derivative. With an excess of acylating agent, a mixture of the 2,6 and 2,7diacetyl derivatives is usually obtained. A typical reaction sequence for preparing the intermediate is EMI4.1 Condensation of the intermediate acetyl compounds with a p dialkylaminobenzaldehyde in the presence of a base, e.g., sodium hydroxide, gives the a unsaturated ketones, I, of the invention. Sensitizers of this invention whereinR1 R2 is CH2 can be prepared, for example, by the following reaction sequence EMI4.2 EMI5.1 In the reaction sequences depicted above, carbonylation of the starting hydrocarbon with 1,1 dichioromethyl methyl ether in the presence of Ti Cl4 gives the corresponding aldehyde C. Condensation of C with malonic acid in the well known Perkin or related condensation reaction can give D, and catalytic hydrogenation of D can give the substituted propionic acid E. Conversion of E to the acid chloride withPC15 followed by intramolecular Friedel Crafts cyclization can give the cyclic ketones G. Preparation Of Sensitizers When R7 Is B These sensitizers are prepared by condensing the appropriate acetyltetrahydronaphthalene, acetylindane, or corresponding cyclic carbonyl compound, with a p dialkylaminobenzaldehyde in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide, to give the a unsaturated ketones of the invention. Ketone starting materials wherein R1 R2 H are generally prepared by reaction of the corresponding hydrocarbons, e.g., tetrahydronaphthalene or indane, with acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride in the presence of aluminum chloride to obtain the desired acetyl derivatives.Cyclic ketones wherein R1 R2 is CH2 can be prepared by reaction of the corresponding hydrocarbon, e.g., tetrahydronaphthalene or indane, with S chloropropionyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride to give the ss chloropropionyl derivative followed by cyclization of this intermediate with concentrated sulfuric acid to give the desired cyclic carbonyl compound.Photopolymerizable CompositionsThe Ethylenically Unsaturated Compound i Contemplated monomers include those which form both water soluble and water insoluble polymers.Typical monomers are alkylene or polyalkylene glycol diacrylate prepared from an alkylene glycol of 2 to 15 carbons or a polyalkylene ether glycol of 1 to 10 ether linkages, and those disclosed in Martin andBarney, U.S. 2,927,022, e.g., those having a plurality of addition polymerizable ethylenic linkages, particularly when present as terminal linkages, and especially those wherein at least one and preferably most of such linkages are conjugated with a doubly bonded carbon, including carbon doubly bonded to carbon and to such hetero atoms as nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. Outstanding are such materials wherein the ethylenically unsaturated groups, especially the vinylidene groups, are conjugated with ester or amide structures. The following specific compounas are illustrative of this class unsaturated esters of alcohols, preferably polyols and particularly such of the alphamethylene carboxylic acids, e.g., ethylene glycol diacrylate, diethylene glycol diacrylate, glycerol diacrylate, glycerol iriacrylate, ethylene glycol di methacrylate, 1, 3 propanediol dimethacrylate, 1,2,4 butanetriol trirnethacrylate, 1, 4 cyclohexanediol diacrylate, l,4 benzenediol cimethacrylate, penta erythritol tetramethacrylate, 1,3 propanediol diacrylate, 1,3 pentanediol dimethacrylate, the bisacrylates and methacrylates of polyethylene glycols of molecular weight 200 500, and the lie unsaturated amides, particularly those of the alpha methylene carboxylic acids, and especially those of alpha omega diamines and oxygen interrupted omega diamines, such as methylene bis acrylamide, methylene bis methacrylamide, ethylene bis methacrylamide, 1, 6 hexamethylene bisacrylamide, diethylene thiamine tris methacrylamide, bis gamma methacrylamidopropoxy ethane beta methacrylamidoethyl methacrylate, N beta hydroxyethyl beta methacrylamido ethyl acrylate and N,N bis beta methacryloxyethyl acrylamide vinyl esters such as divinyl succinate, divinyl adipate, divinyl phthalate, divinyl terephthalate, divinyl benzene l , 3 disulfonate, and divinyl butane 1,4 disulfonate, styrene anc derivatives thereof and unsaturated aldehydes, such as sorbaldehyde hexadienal . An outstanding class of these preferred addition polymerizable components are the esters and amides of alpha rnethylenecarboxylic acids and substituted carboxylic acids with polyols arid polyamines wherein the molecular chain between the hydroxyls and amino groups is solely carbon or oxygen interrupted carbon. The preferred monomertc compounds are polyfunctional, but monofunctional monomers can also be used. In addition, the polymerizable, ethylenically unsaturated polymers of Burg U.S. 3,043,805, MartinU.S. 2,929,710 and similar materials may be used alone or mixed with other materials.Acrylic and methacrylic esters of polyhydroxy compounds such as pentaerythritol and trimethylolpropane, and acrylic and methacrylic esters of abducts of ethylene oxide and polyhydroxy compounds such as those described in Cohen andSchoenthaler, U.S. 3,380,831 are also useful. The photocrosslinkable polymers disclosed in Schoenthaler,U.S. 3,418,295, and Celeste, U.S. 3,a48,089, may also be used. The amount of monomer added varies with the particular polymer used. Other useful ethylenically unsaturated compounds are the ethylenically unsaturated diester polyhydroxy polyethers described in U.S. Patents 3,661,576, 3,373,075 and 3,637,618. Many ethylenically unsaturated monomers are subject to thermal polymerization, especially when stored for long periods or at elevated temperatures.When such compounds are supplied commercially, it is customary for them to contain a small amount of a thermal polymerization inhibitor. These inhibitors can be left in the monomers when the photopolymerizable compositions of this invention are prepared, as was done in the Examples which follow. The resulting compositions usually have satisfactory thermal stability. If unusual thermal exposure is anticipated, or if monomers containing little or no thermal polymerization inhibitor are employed, compositions with adequate shelf life can be obtained by incorporating about 1 to 500 ppm by weight of monomer, of a thermal polymerization inhibitor such as hydroquinone, methyihydroquinone, p methoxyphenol, and the nitroso dimer inhibitor systems described in Pazos, U.S. 4,168,982.The Initiator ii Dimers consisting of two 2,415 triarylimida zolyl radicals bound together by a single covalent bond are photodissociable to the corresponding triarylimidazolyl radicals. The dimers absorb maximally in the 255 to 275 nm region, and usually show some lesser absorption in the 30.0 to 375 nm region. Although the absorption bands tend to tail out to include wavelengths as high as about 430 nm, they normally require radiation rich in the 255 to 375 nm region for their dissociation. Suitable 2,4,5 triarylimicazolyl dimmers include 2 o chlorophenyl 4 ,5 diphenylimidazolyl dimer, 2 o chlorophenyl 4 ,5 di m methoxyphenyl imida zolyl dimer, 2 o fluorophenyl 4 ,5 diphenylimidazolyl dimer, 2 o methoxyphenyl 4,5 diphenylimidazolyl dimer, 2 p methoxyphenyl 4,5 diphenyllmidazolyl dimer, 2,4 di p methoxyphenyl 5 phenylimidazolyl dimer, 2 2,4 dimethoxyphenyl 4 ,5 diphenylimidazolyl dimer, 2 tp methylmercaptophenyl 4, 5 diphenylimidazolyl dimer, and the like. Other suitable dimers are disclosed by Baum and Henry in U.S.Patent 3,652,275, column 5, line 44, to column 7, line 16, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The imidazolyl dimmers can be used with a freeradical producing hydrogen or electron donor such 2 mercaptobenzoxazole, 2 mercaptobenzthiazole, LeucoCrystal Violet or tris 4 diethylamino 2 methylphenyl methane. Other leuco dyes, e.g., those disclosed inU.S. Patent 3,652,275, column 7, line 24, to column 11, line 32, can also be used. By the term leuco dye is meant the colorless, i.e., reduced, form of a dye compound which can be oxidized to its colored form by the triarylimidazolyl radical.The Sensitizer iii The a, unsaturated ketone sensitizers of this invention, described broadly above, have been found to absorb radiation in the broad spectral range of about 300 to 700 nm. The maximum absorption may is in the range of about 350 to 550 nm and preferably about 400 to 500 nm.Other Additives It is preferred that the photopolymerizable compositions contain a polymeric binder which can serve to strengthen the composition or adhere it to a substrate. Radiation transparent and film forming polymer binders are preferred. Examples of suitable binders are thermoplastic macromolecular organic polymers which have number average molecular weights of at least about 1500, preferably at least about 4000, including such polymer types as a copolyesters based on terephthalic, isophthalic, sebacic, adipic and hexahydroterephthalic acids b nylons or polyamides c vinylidene chloride copolymers d ethylene vinvl acetate copolymers Ce cellulosic ethers f synthetic rubbers g cellulose esters h polyvinyl esters including polyvinyl acetate acrylate and polyvinyl acetate methacrylate copolymers i polyacrylate and a alkyl polyacrylate esters, e.g., polymethyl methacrylate, polyethyl methacrylate, and methyl methacrylate ethyl acrylate copolymers j high molecular weight polyethylene oxides of polyglycols having average molecular weights of about 4000 to 1,000,000 k polyvinyl chloride and copolymers 1 polyvinyl acetal m polyurethanes n polycarbonates o polystyrenes. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the polymeric binder is selected so that the unexposed photopolymerizable coating is soluble in predominantly aqueous solution, for example dilute aqueous alkaline solution, but upon exposure to actinic radiation becomes relatively insoluble therein.Typically, polymers which satisfy these requirements are carboxylated polymers such as vinyl addition polymers containing free carboxylic acid groups.A most preferred group of binders includes polyacrylate esters and poly a alkylacrylate esters which contain carboxyl groups particularly prefrre are the polymethyl methacrylate esters. In preferred positive working photopolymerizable compositions, nitroaromatic photoinhibitors as disclosed in U.S. 4,198,242 are present.These compounds are used in amounts of about 0.5 to 15 parts by weight per 100 parts of the combined weight of ethylenically unsaturated compound and binder. A wide range of nonpolymerizable plasticizers are effective in achieving improved exposure and develop ment temperature latitude. When a macromolecular binder is present in the layer, plasticizer would be selected which is compatible with the binder as well as the ethylenically unsaturated monomer and other components of the composition. With acrylic binders, for example, plasticizers can include butyl phthalate and other esters of aromatic acids esters of aliphatic polyacids such as diisooctyl adipate, and nitrate esters aromatic or aliphatic acid esters of glycols, polyoxyalkylene glycols, aliphatic polyols alkyl and aryl phosphates low molecular weight polyesters of poly methylstyrenes chlorinated paraffins and sulfonamide types can be used.In general, water insoluble plasticizers are preferred for greater high humidity storage stability, but are not necessary to get improved latitude. Other inert additives can be employed such as dyes, pigments and fillers. These additives are generally present in minor amounts so as not to interfere with the exposure of the photopolymerizable layer.Substrates For The Photopolymerizable Compositions The photopolymerizable compositions can be coated on a wide variety of substrates. By substrate is meant any natural or synthetic support, preferably one which is capable of existing in a flexible or rigid film or sheet form. For example, the substrate can be a metal sheet or foil, a sheet or film of synthetic organic resin, cellulose paper, fiberboard, and the like, or a composite of two or more of these materials. The particular substrate will generally be determined by the use application involved. For example, when printed circuits are produced, the substrate may be a plate which is a copper coating on fiberboard in the preparation of lithographic printing plates, the substrate is anodized aluminum. Specific substrates include alumina blasted aluminum, anodized aluminum, alumina blasted polyethylene terephthalate film, polyethylene terephthalate film, e.g., resinsubbed polyethylene terephthalate film, polyvinyl alcohol coated paper, cross linked polyester coated paper, nylon, glass, cellulose acetate film, heavy paper such as lithographic paper, and the like. An antihalation material can be used beneath the photopolymerizable layer, for example, in the substrate or on its surface. When an antihalation layer is used between the photopolymerizable layer and the substrate, the layer must have adequate adhesion to the substrate and the photopolymerizable layer and not react with the radiation adsorptive material. Antihalation pigments and resin carriers are described inBritish Patent 1,366,769. The photopolymerizable composition is usually applied to the substrate as a solution or dispersion in a carrier solvent. The solution or dispersion can be sprayed, brushed, applied by a roller or an immersion coater, flowed over the surface, picked up by immersion or applied to the substrate by other suitable means.The solvent is then allowed to evaporate. In general, solvents are employed which are volatile at ordinary pressures. Examples of suitable solvents include water amides such as N,N dimethylfcrmamide and N,Ndimethylacetamide alcohols and ether alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, 1 propanol, 2 propanol, butanol, ethylene glycol, 2 butoxyethanol, and 2 ethoxyethanol esters such as methyl acetate and ethyl acetate aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic halocarbons such as benzene, o dichlorobenzene and toluene ketones such as acetone, 2 butanone, and 3 pentanone aliphatic halocarbons such as l,l,l trichloroethane, methylene chloride, chloroform, l,l,2 trichloroethane, 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane, 1,1,2 trichloroethylene miscellaneous.solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide, pyridine, tetrahydrofuran, 1 ,2 dimethoxyethane, dioxane, dicyanocyclo butane, N methylpyrrolidone and mixtures of these solvents in various proportions as may be required to attain solutions. Alternatively. the photopolymerizable composition can be formed into a film and the film can be applied to the substrate. Preferably the layers of the photopolymerizable compositions have a thickness ranging from about 0.0001 inch 2 5 Vm to 0.01 inch 250 Vm and are applied to a thin, flexible, polymeric film support which can transmit actinic radiation to the photopolymerizable layer. The opposite side of the photopolymerizable layer can have adhered thereto a protective cover layer or cover sheet wherein the sheet has less adhesion to the layer than to the film support.A particularly preferred support is a transparent polyethylene terephthalate film having a thickness of about 0.001 inch 25 Ism . Polyethylene, 0.001 inch ,25 Vm is a preferred cover sheet polyvinyl alcohol coating is a preferred cover layer. Any convenient source of actinic radiation providing wavelengths in the region of the spectrum that overlap the ,Q unsaturated ketone sensitizers absorption bands can be used to activate the photopolymerizable compositions for triarylimidazolyl radical formation, image formation and photopolymerization initiation. The radiation can be natural or artificial, monochromatic or polychromatic, incoherent or coherent, and for high efficiency should correspond closely in wavelengths to the sensitizer s principal absorption bands and should be sufficiently intense to activate a substantial proportion of the sensitizer. Conventional radiation sources include fluorescent lamps, mercury, metal additive and arc lamps providing narrow or broad radiation bands centered near 405, 436 and 546 nm Hg wavelengths.Coherent radiation sources are the pulsed xenon, argon ion and or ionized neon lasers whose emulsions fall within or overlap the visible absorption bands of the sensitizer. Ultraviolet and visible emitting cathode ray tubes widely useful in printout systems for writing on photosensitive materials are also useful with the subject compositions. These cathode ray tubes comprise an ultraviolet or visible emitting phosphor internal coating as the means for converting electrical energy to light energy and a fiber optic face plate as the means for directing the radiation to the photosensitive target. Electron accelerators and electron beam sources through an appropriate mask are also suitable. The radiation exposure times can vary from fractions of a second to minutes, depending upon the intensity and spectral energy distribution of the radiation used, its distance from the photopolymerizable layer, and the nature and amounts of the unsaturated compounds in the layer. Customarily, a distance of about 1.5 to 60 inches 3.8 to 153 cm from the photopolymerizable layer is used. Exposure temperatures are not particularly critical, but it is preferred to operate at about ambient temperatures or slightly higher, i.e., about 200 to 500C. Imagewise exposure is conveniently carried out by exposing the photopolymerizable element to actinic radiation through a process transparency, that is, an image bearing transparency consisting of areas substantially opaque and substantially transparent to the radiation being used, where the opaque areas can be substantially of the same optical density for example, a so called line or halftone negative or positive. Suitable process transparencies also include those with a graded range of opaque areas for example, a continuous tone negative. Process transparencies can be constructed of any suitable materials including cellulose acetate film and polyester film. After exposure, the image is developed.Development can be by toning, i.e., dusting with a fine pigment which selectively adheres to the tacky unhardened areas, by dye imbibition or by modulation of diffusion. Generally, however, the portions of the layer corresponding to the unexposed portions are removed, e.g., in lithographic applications. ThQk method of development can be achieved by pressure transfer, differential adhesion of the exposed versus unexposed areas, use of peel apart transfer, and, preferably, by solvent washout. The solvent liquid used for development should have good solvent action on the nonpolymerized portions of the composition, and little action on the insolubilized image in the time required to remove the soluble portions. U 4 t J The photopolymerizable compositions of this invention have very little residual color and good solubility and shelf life, They are useful in printing plates for offset and letter press, engineering drafting films, as well as photoresists in making printed circuits or in chemical milling, and as solder masks. They are also useful in the preparation of video disks. In rinting plate applications, an important use is in a positive negative two exposure imaging system of a positive photopolymer litho printing plate. The compositions are also useful in positive working photopolymer litho films.Still other uses are for preparing colored images from color separation negatives suitable for color proofing. The images formed with these elements can be used for making copies by thermal transfer to a substrate. Other specific uses will be evident to those skilled in the art. In photoresist applications, thin film resists prepared from the composition are useful in the preparation of microcircuits. The resists can be either solvent soluble or aqueous developable. Solder masks are protective coatings which are selectively applied to portions of a printed circuit board surface to confine solder to pad areas on the board and to prevent bridging between conductors during tinning operations and during soldering of components. A solder mask also functions to prevent or minimize corrosion of the base copper conductors and as a dielectric to insulate certain components for adjacent circuitry. Photopolymerizable compositions containing the a, unsaturated ketone sensitizers of this invention show good visible light sensitization. The increase in speed results in a saving of energy and costs related thereto since lower energy exposure sources can be used in exposure of the photopolymerizable element or more elements can be exposed and developed in a given amount of time. Alternatively, the photopolymerizable layer can be exposed by means of an exposure source maintained at a greater distance than normal for known sensitized elements. This permits the exposing radiation to be collimated which is of particular advantage in forming halftone dots having substantially perpendicular sides.The broad sensitization range coupled with the effectiveness of sensitization enables useful positive polymeric images to be formed by a double exposure process, first, imagewise in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum and when overall in the visible region of the spectrum utilizing specific nitroaromatic photoinhibitors.

The dried film was heated at 950 to 1000 for 5 minutes and an oriented polyethylene terephthalate film cover sheet was laminated thereon. Portions of this photosensitive element were exposed to radiation for periods of 5 to 25 seconds through a process transparency in contact with the cover sheet. The process transparency was removed and the elements reexposed overall for 40 seconds to radiation through a cut off filter which absorbed all radiation below 400 nm. The elements were processed through the automatic processor at a rate of 87 in min 221 cm min to produce a good clean positive image. EXAMPLE 7 The photopolymerizable composition of Example 6 was prepared except that the sensitizer from Example 2 was replaced with 0.22 g of the sensitizer fromExample 3. A portion of the photosensitive element prepared from the emulsified composition was exposed to radiation for 10 seconds through a process transparency in contact with the cover sheet. The process transparency was removed and the element reexposed overall for 25 seconds to radiation through the cut off filter.The element was processed through the automatic processor at a rate of 49 inches min 124 cm min to produce a clear positive image with a low level of background. EXAMPLE 8 The photopolymerizable composition of Example 6 was prepared except that the sensitizer from Example 2 was replaced with 0.20 g of the sensitizer from Example 1. A portion of the photosensitive element prepared from the emulsified composition was exposed to radiation for 10 seconds through a process transparency in contact with the cover sheet. The process transparency was removed and the element reexposed overall for 25 seconds to radiation through the cut off filter. The element was processed through the automatic processor at a rate of 49 inches min 124 cm min to produce a sharp positive image on an almost clear background. EXAMPLES 9 TO 11 Photopolymerizable compositions were prepared as described in Examples 6 to 8 and photosensitive elements were prepared from each of these compositions.Portions of the photosensitive elements were exposed to radiation through the cut off filter without a process transparency for a time sufficient to obtain a full density, shiny, image in each Example.

The dried coatings were laminated with a 1 mil 25 prll oriented polyester film coversheet at 820 at a rate of 4 ft min 1.22 m min at 40 psi 276 kPa . One half the surface of a photosensitive element was covered by a black polyethylene sheet. A t2 step wedge process transparency was placed over the uncovered side and the plate was placed in a vacuum printing frame. An imagewise exposure positive exposure was made to radiation from a 2 KW Berkey mercury photopolymer lamp at a distance of 38 in 96 cm for a time which corresponds to a radiation dosage of 10 units. The polyethylene sheet was removed and a Y2 step wedge was placed over the previously blocked off section. A U.V. cut off filter which absorbed essentially all radiation below about 420 nm was placed over the plate and the entire plate was given a 30 unit exposure. This final exposure gave a negative exposure to the blocked off section and completed the two exposure positive sequence on the other half.The exposed element was developed at 220 in a solution prepared from 1536 g of distilled water, 84 g of potassium carbonate 1,5 B20, and 5 g of potassium hydrogen carbonate, and the developed element was rinsed with a 320 water spray at 40 psi 276 kPa .A development time of 10 seconds gave a positive mode speed of 1, i.e., the first step of the positive image was completely unpolymerized, and a negative mode speed of 10, i.e., the negative image showed 10 full and partial polymerized steps.

EXAMPLE 31 The oriented polyester films employed as substrates in Examples 31 to 39 were 4 mil 102 From polyethylene terephthalate films sub coated with a copolymer resin. The copolymer resin comprised a sequentially polymerized mixture of a vinylidene chloride alkyl acrylate itaconic acid copolymer and an alkyl acrylate polymer as described in more detail in U.S. Patent 3,443,950. To the copolymer resin, before coating, was added a methyl methacrylate ethyl acrylate acrylic acid 37 56 7 terpolymer molecular weight 260,000 and acid number 76 to 85 , dispersed with ammonia. The coated films were stretched and a thin layer of the terpolymer in water was added onto the first sub coating. The following stock solution was prepared Component Wt g Tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate 15.0 merpolymer of ethyl acrylate methyl 35.3 methacrylate acrylic acid 56 37 7 , MW 260,000Copolymer of styrene maleic anhydride 36.7 58 42 , esterified, MW 10,000 2 o Chlorophenyl 4 ,5 diphenyl 8.6 imidazolyl dimerMethylene chloride 527Methanol 40. To 10 g of this stock solution was added 0.0407 g of 6 nitroveratraldehyde photoinhibitor and 0.0113 g of the sensitizer from Example 22. Portions of this solution were board coated with a 2 mil 51 pm doctor knife on the resin subbed side of the oriented polyester film substrate, and the coatings were air dried. The dried coatings were laminated with a 1 mil 25 pm oriented polyester film coversheet at 820 at a rate of 4 ft min 1.22 m min at 40 psi 276 kPa One half the surface of a photosensitive element was covered by a black polyethylene sheet. A t32 step wedge process transparency was placed over the uncovered side and the element was placed in a vacuum printing frame.An imagewise exposure positive exposure was made to radiation from a 2KW mercury photopolymer lamp at a distance of 38 in 96 cm using an Ascor Light Integrator Platemaker Model 1415 12 with a Berkey Ascor 1601 40 light source for a time which corresponds to a radiation dosage of 10 units.The polyethylene sheet was removed and a t step wedge was placed over the previously blocked off section. A U.V. cut off filter which absorbed essentially all radiation below about 420 nm was placed over the element and the entire element was given a 30 unit exposure. This final exposure gave a negative exposure to the blocked off section and completed the twoexposure positive sequence on the other half. The exposed element was developed at 220 in a solution prepared from 1536 g of distilled water, 84 g of potassium carbonate 1.5 H2O, and 5 g of potassium hydrogen carbonate, and the developed element was rinsed with a 320 water spray at 40 psi 276 kPa . A development time of 6 seconds gave a positive mode speed of 3, i.e., the first three steps of the positive image were unpolymerized, and a negative mode speed of 10, i.e., the negative image showed 10 full and partial polymerized steps. EXAMPLES 32 AND 33 The photopolymerizable compositions of Examples 32 and 33 were prepared, exposed and developed as described in Example 31 except 1 the sensitizers ofTable 4 were employed and 2 development time of 7 seconds was used in Example 32. Positive mode speeds of 1 and 1 were obtained for Examples 32 and 33, respectively. Negative mode speeds were 11 and 16, respectively. A good image was obtained in each instance.

No 6 nitroveratraldehyde photoinhibitor was added to the compositions. The photosensitive elements were given one 10 unit negative exposure to the photopolymer lamp. A development time of 8 seconds was used. The results, summarized inTable 5, indicate that a good image was obtained in each instance.
