# Winding apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus 16 is provided for winding inextensible flexible elongate material, such as cable 15 , on a carcass 10 of a body while maintaining the tension on the elongate material 15 substantially uniform. A shuttle 20 carries at least one compensator arm assembly 30, 130 resiliently supporting a housing having a sheave 50, 150 in line with an energy dissipator 80, 180 on the side of the sheave 50, 150 closest to the carcass so that the elongate material 15 being fed from a spool 28 under tension and passing over the sheave 50, 150 as the shuttle 20 is rotating around the torus shaped body will apply the elongate material to the carcass 10 under substantially uniform tension as the arm assembly 30, 130 stores up elongate material 15 during periods of low material demand and pays out elongate material during periods of high material demand.
