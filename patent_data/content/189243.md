# A CATALYTIC DEWAXING PROCESS AND A CATALYST COMPOSITION FOR USE IN THE SAME

## Abstract
A process for dewaxing a hydrocarbon feedstock, par ticularly a lube stock, comprises contacting the feedstock under dewaxing conditions with a catalyst composition com prising i a catalytically active porous crystalline alumino silicate, particularly a zeolite having a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 12 and a Constraint index of 1 to 12 and ii a crystalline aluminum phosphate.
