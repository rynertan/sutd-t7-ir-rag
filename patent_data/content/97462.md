# Polymer compositions having a reduced coefficient of friction and elements containing them.

## Abstract
Polymer compositions which have a reduced coefficient of friction are disclosed. The polymer compositions com prise a blend of at least 80 percent by weight of a solid of film forming polymer and at least 0.35 percent by weight of a crosslinked hydroxy containing silicone compound. The composition retains its low coefficient of friction even after being exposed to hydrocarbon solvents during a cleaning process. The composition may be used in forming a protective layer for an element, particularly a photographic element. The composition is particularly suitable in forming a protective layer for a motion picture photographic element.
