## Description
TITLE PRIMER COXPOSITIONS CONTAINING PHENYLSlLOXAN RESIN AND VINYLSILOXANR POLYMER Sackground of the Invention Field of the Invention Tnis invention relates to primer compositions. More precisely, this invention relates to primer compositions which are suitable for bonding heat curable silicone ruboers on the surface of a variety of materials such as metals and wnich can impart excellent bond aurability even at high temperatures exceeding 200 C under a variety of environments such as air, steam, and oil. Description of the Prior Art Silicone rubbers have recently been usec in a variety of fielus requiring rubbery elastomers at nigh tesnperatures because silicone rubbers exhibit excellent heat resistance.When these silicone ruDoers are used in nigh temperature environments, they are often used in the form of composites bonded to various base materials, especially metals such as iron, aluminum and stainless steel, and they are also frequently exposed to steam or heat resistant lubricating oils sucn as silicone oil. However, tne silicone rubber composites deteriorate and the silicone rubber separates at the interface with tne base material before their ruDbery elasticity disappears. Therefore, primers which can maintain a strong lony term bonding strength even under severe conditions are in yreat aemana. In an attempt to improve tne bonding strength under severe conditions, numerous primer compositions nave been proposed. For example, the following compositions are known compositions comprised of a silicone gum, a vinyl containing silicone oil, a vinylalvoxysilane, and phosphoric acid are descrioed by Japanese Patent No. Sho 52 1977 327O7 compositions comprised of a silicone gum, a vinyl containing silicone oil, a polybasic allyl ester, and a fatty acid metal salt are described by fiokai Japanese Patent No. Sho 52 1977 26535 compositions comprised of an acryloxypropylalkoxysilane, and a fatty acid iron salt are aescrioeci by Kokai Japanese Patent No. Sho 55 1980 16050.However, these primer compositions also deteriorate when the bonded portion is subjected to long term exposure to severe conditions under high temperatures ana these compositions are tnerefore not quite satisfactory. Ito et al. in Japanese Kokai Patent No. Sho 55 1980 66951, published May 20, 19, describe a primer composition which can be usea under severe conditions of high temperature in an air atmosphere or in oil. The primer composition of Ito et al. is described as containing oryanopolysiloxanes with a viscosity greater than 0.01 m2 s, a vinyl containing organopolysiloxane with a viscosity of 0.000005 to O.U1 m2 s, R8Si c R9 3 where Rd is a monovalent unsaturated hydrocarbon radical, R9 is methyl, ethyl, 2 ,netnoxyetnyl or 2 ethoxyethyl, and a curing catalyst.Optionally, the composition of Ito et al. can contain an oryanopolysiloxane resin, a silica filler, and an organic peroxide. The inventors conducted intensive research in an attempt to improve the drawbacks mentioned above. As a result, it was discovered that when a phenyl containing polysiloxane resin was used as one of the constituents of a film forming composition, the preparea compositions exhibit excellent heat resistance and primer compositions containing this compound as a primary ingredient are described in the copenaing application filed on even date nerewith and entitled Primer Compositions Containing Phenylsiloxane Resin. In this invention, it has also been discovered tnat when both a pnenyl containing polysiloxane resin and a vinyl containing polyoryanosiloxane are usea as primary ingredients of a film forminy composition, the prepared compositions unexpectedly exhibit excellent bonding strength with any type of suostrate and exhibit excellent heat resistance at temperatures aDove those usable for primer coinpositions containing 3ust the pnenyl containing polysiloxane resin.Thus, the purposes of this invention were to propose adhesive coating compositions which can maintain bonding strength to metals and other various substrates even in high temperature environments and to propose primer compositions which can maintain a high bonding strengtn for long periods, even under severe conditions. summary of the Invention This invention relates to a primer composition consistiny essentially of A 100 parts by weight of an organopolysiloxane resin of the average unit formulaEMI3.1 in wnicn R is a monovalent radical selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbon radicals, halogenated hydrocarbon radicals, and cyanoalkyl radicals where at least 5 percent of tne R are pnenyl radicals, R is hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical, a has a value of from 0.90 to 1.80, and b has a value such that the amount of R O is at least 0.01 percent by weight and up to 20 percent by weight based on tne weight of the resin, B lu to 500 parts by weight of a polyorganosiloxane having a viscosity of at least 0.005 m2 s at 250, and an average unit formulaEMI4.1 in whicn R2 is a monovalent radical selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbon radicals, halogenatea hydrocarbon radicals ana cyanoalkyl radicals where 0.2 to 50 percent of tne R2 are vinyl radicals, the c has a value from 1.9 to 2.3, C 20 to 400 parts by height of a trialkoxysilane of the general formula R3Si OR4 3 in which R3 is a monovalent aliphatic unsaturatea hydrocarbon radical or an acryloxyalkyl radical and R4 is an alkyl radical of 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or a partial hydrolysis condensation product of the trialkoxysilane, D 2 to 100 parts by weight of an organic titanate, and E an organic solvent. Tnis invention also relates to a method of adhering silicone ruDDer to a substrate comprising coating the substrate witn the primer composition of this invention, removing the organic solvent to at least form a semisolid forming a primed substrate surface, thereafter applying to the primed substrate surface a composition which cures to a silicone ruDber Dy neating to form a composite, and heating the composite to cure the composition to form a silicone ruDDer aahereJ to tne substrate through the primer having an aonesion strength resistant to decreasing when exposed to high temperature silicone oil. Detailed Description of tne Invention Component A of this invention is an organopolysiloxane resin as defined. In the formula, R represents monovalent hydrocarbon radicals, e.g., alkyl radicals sucn as methyl, ethyl, propyl ana octadecyl alkenyl radicals such as vinyl and allyl aryl radicals such as phenyl and their substituted derivatives in which hydrogen atoms are suostituted by halogen atoms, and cyanoalkyl radicals. At least 5 of tne R radicals must De pnenyl which are directly Donded to a silicon atom . If the proportion of pnenyl is less tnan 5 , the modulus of tne film increases ana the heat resistance is impaired so that a film with satisfactory duraDility cannot oe obtained.Also, when an organic titanate such as tetra n butyl titanate is used as component C , gelation can occur so that a primer composition cannot be optained in single liquid form. Tneproportion of phenyl groups is preferably 10 to 70 of the R radicals. R represents a nydrogen atom or alkyl radical such as methyl, etnyl, propyl and doaecyl. The value of a ranges from 0.90 to 1.8u. Tne value of b is such that the proportion of silicon bonded nydroxyl or alkoxy in this resin is at least 0.01 percent Dy weight ana up to 20 percent Dy weight bases on the weight of the resin. The organopolysiloxane resins possessing silicon bonded nydroxyl or alkoxy are a primary ingredient of te compositions of this invention and their methods of syntnesis are well know. For example, a mixture of one or two more types of chlorosilane or alkoxysilane, selected in sucn a way that the number of H radicals per silicon atom is 0.90 to 1.80, is hydrolyzed in water or in the presence of a mixture of water ana an organic solvent to obtain the organopolysiloxane resins. In this invention, polycondensed organopolysiloxane resins obtained Dy further heat treatment can oe used, as well as, the organopolysiloxane resins directly obtained after hydrolysis. Moreover, mixtures of two or more types of organopolysiloxane resins can also De used.In addition, organopolysiloxane resins in wnicn both hydroxyl groups and alkoxy groups are present in the same molecule are also applicable. These organopolysiloxane resins are used preferably when they are dissolved in organic solvents, especially aromatic solvents such as benzene, toluene or xylene. Component B of this invention is a vinyl containing polyorganosiloxane. In the formula, R2 represents monovalent hydrocarbon radicals, e.g., alkyl radicals such as ethyl, etnyl, propyl and douecyl cycloalkyl radicals such as cyclohexyl alkenyl radicals such as vinyl and allyl aryl radicals such as phenyl ana the aDove mentioned groups in which nydrogen atoms are suDstituted by halogen atoms, and cyanoalkyl radicals. At least U.28 of the R2 radicals must be vinyl.The vinyl content of the polyorganosiloxane can be sucn that from 0.2 to 50 of the R2 radicals are vinyl, preferably from 0.5 to 25. If the proportion of vinyl radical is less than 0.2i, a satisfactory Donding strength cannot be obtained and peeling sees to occur between the primer film ana the silicone rubber layer at temperatures of about 2300C and above, especially when immersed in a silicone oil. Tne reason why the viscosity at 250C of this polyorganosiloxane must be 5000 centistokes or greater is that at a lower viscosity tne primer film becomes weaker and the fil.n coated over a substrate is not sufficiently cured. wnen a silicone rubber is appliea or cured Dy applying pressure, the primer composition slides and the silicone ruober is not bonded at all or inadequately partially bonded. The viscosity at 250C of component B used in this invention is preferably 0.1 m2 s or greater. Examples of the groups at the ends of the molecular chain of this organopolysiloxane are silanol, aimethylvinylsilyl, methylvinylphenylsilyl, trimethylsilyl, dimethylpnenylsilyl ano methyl iphenylsilyl however, the terminal groups are not critical. The mixing proportion or component B ranges from 10 to 500 parts Dy weight per 100 parts Dy weight of component A . If tne mixing proportion is less tnan lu parts Dy weight, tne primer film, at hign temperatures, exhibits less affinity for tne silicone rubber to be oondeo ana rubbery elastorueric properties are not oDtainea so that tne primer film ooes not exhiDit suitable stress strains, especially snaring stress and torsion stress. If tne mixing proportion exceeds 50Ã¹ parts by weight, the donning strength is also impaired. Preferaoly tne amount of B is from 25 to 400 parts by weight. Tne trialKoxysilanes used in this invention, component C , are an essential component whicn can impart bondaoility to the composition of this invention. In the formula mentioned above, R3 represents alipnatic unsaturated hydrocaroon radicals such as vinyl and allyl, and acryloxyalkyl raaicals and R4 represents alKyl radicals such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl ana isopropyl. Preferred examples of these trialkoxysilanes are trialkoxysilanes expressed by tne general formula H2C CH CH2 d Si OR4 3 wnere a is 0 or 1, anu trialkoxysilanes expresses by tne general formula EMI8.1 where R6 represents a hydrogen atom or methyl radical, R7 represents divalent hydrocarbon radicals, e.g., alkylene radicals sucn as metnylene, ethylene and propylene and arylene radicals such as phenylene.Examples of these trialkoxysilanes are as follows vinyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltriethoxysilane, vinyltrist WInethoxyethoxy silanet gamma methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, gamma methacryloxy propyltr iethoxysilane, allyltrimethoxysilane and allyltriethoxysilane. Tne partial hydrolysis condensation products of these trialkoxysilanes can also be used. Tne mixing proporation of component C ranges from 20 to 400 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of component A , preferaoly 25 to 350 parts by weight. The oceanic titanates or their partial hydrolysis condensation product are component D of this invention.This component is capable of imparting curability to the primer compositions of this invention and an ability to dry in air. In addition, this component has the effect of improving the Donning property and especially the heat resistance. Examples of the organic titanates are the tetraalkyltitanates, sucn as tetraisopropyl titanate, tetra n butyl titanate, butyl titanate dimer of tne formula C4H9O 3TiOTi OC4H9 3, tetra 2 ethylhexyl titanate, and their polymers. In this invention, it aesirable, titanium chelates such as titanium acetylacetonate, of the formula C3H7O 2Ti C6H7O2 2, polytitanium acetylacetonate, titanium octyl glycolate of tne formula C4H9O 2Ti C8H16O2 2, titanium lactate of the formula dO 2Ti C3H503 2, titanium lactate ethyl ester of the formula C3H70 2Ti C5H903 2, and triethanolamine titanate of the formula C6H1303N Ti can De used singly or together with the tetraalkyltitanates.The mixing proportion of component D ranges from 2 to 100 parts Dy weight per 100 parts by weight of component A . Component E used in this invention is an organic solvent in which tne compositions of this invention are dissolved. An appropriate solvent is selected from a consideration of the solubility and volatility during primer coating. Examples of these solvents are as follows toluene, xylene, benzene, heptane, hexane, trichloroetnylene, perchloroethylene, methylene chloride, ethanol, isopropanol, and Dutanol. Tnese solvents can be used singly or as a solvent mixture of two or more types. In terms of the mixing proportion of tne solvent, the compnsitions of this invention are advantageously dissolved in sucn a way tnat the viscosity of tne solution is suitable for primer coating, but the mixing proportion of solvent is not particularly critical. To improve tne bonding strength between the substrate ana primer film by further improvin9 the air drying ability of the compositions of this invention, tetraalkoxysilanes expressed by the general formula Si oR5 4 where R5 represents an alkyl rascal sucn as methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl or their partial hydrolysis condensation products are added effectively as component F . Examples of these tetraalKoxysilanes are tetramethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane, and tetrabutoxysilane. If this tetraalkoxysilane is used, the mixing proportion ranges from 20 to 40U parts Dy weight per lou parts Dy weight of component , preferably 40 to 150 parts Dy weight. Tne presence of component F is desirable to proviae a longer air drying time.Tne longer air drying time is neeoed oecause component B is present. The compositions of this invention can be easily prepared Dy simply homogeneously blending components A through E or components A through F . In order to improve further tne strength of the film after curing, a variety of inorganic fillers sucn as finely pulverized silica can be added. In this case, surface treated silica filler is suitable as a filler. Moreover, known neat resisting agents, coloring agents ana other additives, e.g., red iron oxide cerium oxide, cerium hydroxide, cerium salts of fatty acids, iron salts of fatty acids, titanium oxide and carbon black canDe arDitrarily added as long as this does not interfere wit the purpose of this invention. The primer compositions of this invention are coated on a suDstrate. After the substrate is coated, the organic solvent is removed by air drying or by heating. One convenient method of organic solvent removal is to let tne coating air dry. Tne lengtn of time for a specific primer composition to air dry will vary with the kind of solvent used, tne solvent content, the kind of catalyst, and the kind of alKoxy radical. However, the air drying time snould De sufficient to at least form a semisolid from the primer composition. For best results, the air drying time should be at least 30 minutes, preferably longer. After the organic solvent has been removed from the primer composition, a silicone rubber composition which cures by heating can be applied over the primed substrate surface to form a composite. The composite is then heated to cure the silicone rubber composition resulting in a silicone rubber adheres to tne substrate through a primer. Xhen the compositions of this invention are useci as primers, a silicone rubDer can be strongly bonded on the surface of various metals such as iron, aluminum, nickel, chromium, zinc, and copper or their alloys, and synthetic resin materials such as acrylic resins, pnenolic resins, and epoxy resins. In addition, there is tne excellent effect that the bond strength is not impaired despite exposure to oils and steam at high temperatures, especially at or above 2300C.Using this excellent characteristic, the compositions of this invention are effectively used as primers when a silicone ruDber is to De bondea with an oil seal housing, with the core metal of tne rollers in a copier, with engine mounted core metals and with other metals. Preferred primer compositions are those which contain acryloxyalkyltrialkoxysilanes.

Both of the above preferred embodiments can optionally contain 40 to 150 parts by weight of a tetraalKoxysilane in which the alkoxy radical has from 1 to 3 carbon atoms.
