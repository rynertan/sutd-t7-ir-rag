# Methods and apparatus for the manufacture of pneumatic tyres.

## Abstract
In the feeding of a strip 11 of tyre building material to a former 56 , it is desirable to achieve a butt joint between the ends 35, 75 of the strip when it has been wrapped fully around the circumference of the former which may already have some material which has been wrapped around its sur face in a previous operation . As the strip 11 is fed to the former, its length is measured and the diameter of the former is adjusted if necessary to match the circumference of the former and any existing material thereon to the length of the strip 11 .
