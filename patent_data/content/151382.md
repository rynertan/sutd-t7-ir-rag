# DATA DISPLAY UNIT FOR A BICYCLE

## Abstract
A running data display unit 1 for a bicycle calculates running data such as running speed, running distance, average speed, maximum speed etc. of a bicycle, based on pulse signals from a revolution detecting portion 3 . This calculation is performed by a microcomputer incorporated in the display unit. The running data obtained by the calculation are displayed in a digital form on a liquid crystal display panel 15 . The panel 15 gives display of a speed unit km h or mile h selectively. This display of km h or mile h emits winking light when the microcomputer measures deter mined running data such as the running distance, the average speed etc. and etmis uninterrupted light when measuring of such running data is stopped. As a result, the rider of the bicycle can immediately ascertain whether measuring operation is being made or not.
