# Second Breakdown protection circuit for X Ray generator inverter.

## Abstract
In an X ray generator operating with a pulse width modulated transistor inverter, means are provided to sense the collector emitter voltage of each of the transistors and to responsively turn off the transistor when that voltage level reaches a predetermined threshold level which is indicative of a problem. Provision is included to inhibit the operation of the protective circuit during the time period in which the transistor is turning on so as to thereby allow for higher voltages during that critical period.
