## Description
SKI BOOT TOE FERRULE PARTICULARLY FOR CROSS COUNTRY SKI BOOTS This invention relates to a ski boot toe ferrule particularly for cross country ski boots. Known are several types of ferrules for crosscountry skiing boots which generally comprise a small block carried forwardlg on the boot and supporting a pair of metal pegs or inserts in a variety of config urations for engagement with the ski bindings0 Usually such metal pegs or inserts have different shapes to meet the skier s own requirements, and this in order to provide improved convenience and better utilization of the skiers exertion on the skiso There are metal pegs or inserts which do not allow the boot to pivot about the attachment point of the boot to the ski binding, thereby the sole of the boot is deformed elastically during the striding and boot flexing movements performed by the skier. There are also metal pegs or inserts which permit only partial rotation of the boot about the attachment point with successive flexing of the sole. In practice, a skier will select the type of ski bindings in conformity with personal preferences and the conditions which he she is expecting to meet while skiing. However, such prior toe ferrules are not devoid of drawbacks, such as total dependence upon the type of bindings to which the boot is to be mounted. Another drawback is that the toe ferrule cannot be re used in the event of it, or a single one of the metal pegs or inserts, being accidentally broken, or wearing out. It is a primary object of this invention to provide a toe ferrule for attaching the boot to the ski which is not compulsorily related to the type of ski bindings to be adopted, thereby allowing a wider choise for the skier, which best suits hither preferences and demands. Another object of the invention is to enable worn out or broken metal pegs or inserts to be replaced with new metal pegs or inserts without incurring the neces sity to replace the whole toe ferrule or even the whole ski boot. These and other objects are achieved by a ski boot toe ferrule particularly for cross country skis, characterized in that it comprises a cylindrical seat defined in a small block carried forwardly on the ski boot and pivotally accommodating therein a small internally threaded cylinder having a substantially perpendicular axis with respect to the longitudinal axis of the boot and lying parallel to a plane defined by the top face of the ski for releasable engagement with metal pegs or inserts adapted for coupling with various ski bindings. Further features and advantages will become apparent from the detailed description of a toe ferrule according to the invention, with reference to the accompanying illustrative drawing, where Figure 1 is a partly sectional top plan view of a toe ferrule according to the invention Figure 2 is an example of different configuration pegs which may be carried on a toe ferrule according to the invention Figure 3 is a partly sectional side view of a toe ferrule according to the invention, with a fragmentary view of the ski binding Figure 4 is a partly sectional side view of a toe ferrule according to the invention showing the movement during the stride Figure 5 is a plan view of a toe ferrule with a U like element partly embedded therein Figure 6 is a perspective side view of a toe ferrule according to the invention having enhanced flexibility and Figure 7 is a perspective side view of the same toe ferrule of Figure 6, according to the invention, during the flexing thereof. Viith reference to the drawing figures, a toe ferrule according to the invention, generally designated with the reference numeral 1, comprises a small block 2 of an elastically deformable material which is carried forwardly on a ski boot. Internally of the block there may be noticed a foil 3 which at an end portion thereof, has a cylindrical seat 4 according to the invention. This cylindrical seat has an axis which extends substantially perpendicular to the boots longitudinal axis and parallel to the top face of the ski, it being adapted for accommodating, according to the invention,a small cylinder or barrel 5 which is rotatable about its own axis relatively to the cylindrical seat. The cylinder 5 has two threaded portions 6a and 6b, respectively, on its interior, which portions extend from each end of the cylinder 5, towards the centre portion thereof. Advatageously, of the two threads, one is righthanded and the other left handed to facilitate opposite threading in of the metal pegs or inserts 7, when the block 2 has been introduced into a ski binding, includ ing lateral walls 100 having axially aligned holes formed therein for introduction of the threaded portions of said metal pegs or inserts, for threaded engagement with said threaded portions of said cylindrical seat. Further, and aa shown in Figure 5, the toe ferrule of this invention may carry a substantially U like element 8 which has a straight portion 9 partly embedded in the small block 2. This straight portion 9 extends along a direction extending substantially perpendicular to the boot longitudinal axis and parallel to the ski top face, it having its ends overhanging the side faces of the block 2 on opposite sides thereof. From the ends of this straight portion there extend two co directional arms 10a and 10b which are equidistant from the side faces of the block 2 and have their free ends connected to the boot sole. Teach of the ends of the straight portion supports a bushing 11 rotatably thereon which releasably engages with the ski binding. Advantageously, the block 2 defines a first dimension, as measured parallel to the axis of the cylindrical seat, which is substantially equal to that of the ski binding seat which is adapted to receive it, and a second dimension, measured perpendicularly to the plane defined by the boot sole, which is vubstan tially larger than 1 3 of the first dimension. The ferrule 1, moreover, may have at the top thereof a recess 12 which extends in a substantially perpendicular direction to the longitudinal axis of the boot, and at the bottom, an inclined surface adapted for utilizing, during the first portion of the stride, the rotation of the ferrule relatively to the binding and subsequently the flexing of the ferrule itself as shown in Figure 6. The operation of the inventive ferrule will be apparent from the foregoing description. Depending upon the bindings carried on the skia, metal pegs or inserts are selected for threading into the cylinder 5. Thus, irrespective of the binding types, there will always occur a partial rotation of the boot and subsequent flexing of the ferrule. In the event of even a single peg or insert wearing out or becoming broken, it would be sufficient to unthread the damaged peg and replace it with a new one. It has been found in actual practice that a toe ferrule according to the invention enables one and the same boot to be used with different bindings for cross coLintry skis by merely replacing either both pegs or one insert. In practicing the invention, the materials used and the dimensions may be any selected ones contingent on requirements and the state of the art.
