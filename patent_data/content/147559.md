# Superconducting films and devices exhibiting AC to DC conversion.

## Abstract
Superconducting films 12 and devices are provided which exhibit an AC to DC conversion effect of an RF AC input signal. The films 12 can be microscopically in homogeneous with granular or columnar microstructures 13 in layered or non layered structures, which provide the conversion effect with and without an applied magnetic field. The films 12 also can be multilayer films 22 which provide the conversion effect with a magnetic field applied to the films. The multilayer films 22 are substantially composi tionally homogeneous within the layers and the microscopic ally inhomogeneous films are substantially compositionally homogeneous throughout, but include structural in homogeneities.
