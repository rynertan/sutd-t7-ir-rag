# Process for the electrochemical synthesis of ethylene Glycol from formaldehyde.

## Abstract
A process for the formation of glycols, particularly ethylene glycol through the electrochemical coupling of aldehydes such as formaldehyde in neutral or acidic solu tions producing high yields and product selectivities is disclosed. The process can also be effectively operated in the presence of a wide variety of polar, miscible, organic cosolvents.
