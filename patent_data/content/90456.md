# X ray display device.

## Abstract
A tunable Fabry Perot interferometer the supports of which for the two parallel mirrors consist of bundles of optical fibres and the mirros are provided on the ends of the fibres, may be used advantageously in an X ray display device be tween the display screen on which the visible X ray image is displayed, and the television camera tube. By using the Fabry Perot interferometer as a light attenuator in such a device the situation in which the camera tube is overdriven when making an X ray record, can be prevented by causing the reflection coefficient of the mirrors in the visible range of the spectrum to be 99 or more, the half width of the transmission wavelength pass band of the Fabry Perot interferometer, can be made less than 50 nm.
