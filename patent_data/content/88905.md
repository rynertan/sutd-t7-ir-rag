# Adsorbent fractionator with automatic temperature sensing cycle control and process.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are provided for adsorbing water vapor or other first gas from a mixture thereof with a second gas to reduce the water vapor or first gas concentra tion in the mixture to below a permissible maximum concentration, in which the advance of the leading edge of the adsorption front in a sorbent bed is detected by sensing the advance of the temperature front that precedes the adsorption front, and this advance is detected by sensing the temperature of the sorbent bed sufficiently far from the end of the bed to prevent the temperature front from leaving the bed, using a temperature sampling probe when the temper ature front reaches this point, the adsorption front is still a distance away, since it follows the temperature front, and the adsorption cycle is discontinued, and the bed regenerated the regeneration cycle can similarly be controlled indepen dently, to be terminated when regeneration is complete, as detected by advance of the temperature front in the opposite direction.
