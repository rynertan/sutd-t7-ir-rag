# Positioning reel.

## Abstract
A positioning reel 10 for suspending a body 17 , such as a lightweight tool, at any vertical position within the limits of the suspension cord 18 length is disclosed. An adjusting screw 38 which regulates a clutch type tensioning brake 22, 30, 32 permits the supporting force of the positioning reel to be set to equalize the weight of the suspensed body such that little effort is required to lower the suspended body. With the downward external positioning force re moved from the suspended body, it remains in its present position. The suspended body can be easily raised by applying an upward external force equal to slightly more than the weight of the suspended body. When raising the suspended body, a clock type coil spring 24 actuates a spool 22 within the positioning reel for retracting the suspension cord. A spring type override clutch 22A, 62 permits reeling in the suspension cord while bypassing the tensioning brake. With the upward external force removed from the suspended body, it will again remain in its present position.
