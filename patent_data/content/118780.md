# Dual chamber pacemaker with automatic high rate limit mode determination.

## Abstract
A programmable dual chamber cardiac pacemaker Fig. 1 provides improved means for responding to sensed high atrial rates. The pacemeker monitors 206 the sensed high artial rates and determines, whether they are physiological or not, and automatically controls the operative atrial refractory period as a function of whether or not the atrial rate is physiological 212, 213, 215 . The pacemaker is permitted to go into a Wenkebach mode of operation only when it is determined that a sensed high atrial rate is physiological 215, 233 , and under other high rate condi tions will automatically go into a block mode of operation 250, 252, 255, 263 .
