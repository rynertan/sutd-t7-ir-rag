# Ignition and fuel control system for internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
An electronic ignition and fuel control system is pro vided for internal combustion automotive vehicle engines which are of the spark ignition type. The ignition and fuel control system of this invention includes an electronic timing and detector circuit, distributor circuit, clock and command circuit, ignition power circuit and air fuel control circuit. The clock and command circuit responds to selected positioning of an accelerator control element to provide either a plurality of firing pulses to the engine ignitors in an acceleration mode of operation, or to provide single pulse firing in the case of steady state operation or a deceleration mode of operation. In the ignition and power circuit, individual coils 51 are provided for generating a high voltage firing pulse applied to each of the ignitors that are interconnected with the respec tive coil. Control of the air fuel mixture provided to the engine cylinders is achieved through a device having a fuel valve that is electronically controlled in accordance with the outputs from the clock and command circuit 70 as deter mined by the particular mode of operation and to also control air flow to the engine.
