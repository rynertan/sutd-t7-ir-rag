# Fuel nozzle for gas turbine engine.

## Abstract
A fuel nozzle for a gas turbine engine is constructed with two major castings where one is the support 10 and the other is the head 12 both welded together adjacent the fuel orifice plate 24 . The fuel passage 14 is cast into the support 10 providing a smooth radius 16 from the radial to axial flow path and a smooth transition from the circular to the annular cross section. This configuration allows dimension control over the filming lip 30 and other critical dimensions of the nozzle.
