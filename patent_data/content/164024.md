# NITROGEN ADSORPTION PROCESS

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for adsorption of ni trogen from nitrogen containing gases using faujasite con taining compositions in which the original hydrogen or mo novalent forms are ion exchanged to their polyvalent form and then dehydrated in such a manner as to result in a pre ponderence of its polyvalent ions in a dehydrated dehy droxylated state while maintaining substantially the same zeolite content. The resulting compositions, whose cations contained in the faujasitic portion are substantially in their dehydrated dehydroxylated state, have been found to have surprisingly high selectivities and capacities for the separa tion of air into nitrogen and oxygen.
