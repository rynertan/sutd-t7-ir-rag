# Single exposure positive working photopolymer element.

## Abstract
A high speed, positive working photopolymer element comprising, in order 1 a support, 2 a nonphotosensitive layer comprising a hardenable binder e.g., gelatin contain ing a releasable hardener e.g., glutaraldehyde bisulfite , and an optional colorant, and 3 a permeable photopolymeriz able layer. Imagewise exposure of the photopolymerizable layer is followed by diffusion of an alkali through the nonimage area, releasing the hardener. A subsequent wash off step produces a positive image of the original.
