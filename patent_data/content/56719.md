# A method of producing a laminate.

## Abstract
A method of forming a laminate by sealing round the opposed edges of a pair of spaced face to face sheets with curable liquid in the intersheet space thereby to prevent escape of the liquid, 4 providing a conduit 3 through the seal to allow air to pass along it from the intersheet space, removing or blocking off the conduit and solidifying the liquid.

## Description
A Method of Producing a LaminateThis invention relates to a method of producing a laminate.My co pending Application No. 7915641 describes and claims a method of producing a laminate comprising placing a pair of sheets of frangible material in face to face relationship, introducing between the sheets a liquid which on solidifying forms a polymer of greater resistance to fracture than the sheets and adheres to the sheets, forming around the periphery of the sheets a continuous barrier to passage of the liquid thereby to retain the liquid between the sheets, wherein at least part of the barrier is gaspermeable, expelling air from the intersheet space through the barrier so as to cause the liquid to fill the intersheet space, and solidifying the liquid to form a bonded laminate.In practice the barrier is usually formed by gas permeable and liquid impermeable adhesive tape through which air escapes to allow the liquid to fill the ei ntersheet space.The air escapes through the tape fairlysslowly, however, and this can be a disadvantage when large laminates are being produced.According to the present invention there is provided a method of producing a laminate, comprising placing a pair of sheets to be laminated in face to face relationship, introducing between the sheets a liquid which on solidifying adheres to the sheets, forming around the periphery of the sheets a continuous barrier to passage of the liquid thereby to retain the liquid between the sheets, providing through the barrier a conduit to allow air to escape through it from the intersheet space, removing or blocking the conduit and solidifying the liquid.The conduit is provided so as to allow rapid but controllable removal of air from the intersheet space. Air can pass through the conduit until at least the majority of it has been removed, at which point the conduit can either be removed completely or blocked against further passage of air or liquid. This latter action can be performed for example by sealing the outlet end of the conduit so that air then trapped in the conduit prevents entry and passage of liquid.Preferably removal of the conduit should not leave an aperture through which liquid can escape before solidifying when for example the seal is resilient the aperture formed by passage of the conduit can reclose, particularly under the weight of one of the sheets.The sheets may be of frangible material and the liquid on solidifying preferably forms a polymer having greater resistance to fracture than the sheets.The barrier can either be gas permeable, for example Scotchmount tape, or n on permeable such as rubber strip.In the gas permeable case the conduit can be withdrawn or blocked shortly prior to the liquid filling the entire intersheet space, the remaining air escaping through the barrier. If the seal is non permeable the conduit is left in position and open until the liquid resin has filled the envelope and all the air has escaped.The conduit may be any suitable narrow bore instrument such as a hollow needle, and is preferably sufficiently large to allow air to escape quickly and sufficiently small to allow the aperture formed through the barrier to reclose on withdrawal. It has been found that hollow needles having an inside diameter of from 0.2 0.8 mm, preferably about 0.75 mm, and an outside diameter of lmm or less are especially effective.The conduit can be used in a passive role in which air is allowed to escape under the effect of the spreading liquid, or in an active role in which suction means are employed to draw air through the conduit from the intersheet space, thus speeding up the procedure.In some cases air bubbles can become trapped within the liquid in the intersheet space and these can be removed by the present method by presenting thetend of the needle to the air bubble and applying suction, thus drawing the air into the conduit for removal from the intersheet space.The conduit may be inserted into the air bubble or merely disposed close to it, as the suction can draw the bubble into the conduit even at a distance.The conduit can be located at the area of the intersheet space most likely td retain air longest, or can be withdrawn and re inserted several times as the liquid spreads into different areas. More than one conduit can be used simultaneously as required.An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of illustration in the following Example with reference to the accompanying drawing which is a plan view of a laminate being formed by the present method.EXAMPLE Two rectangular sheets of glass are cleaned using a glass washing machine and gas permeable Scotchmount tape is applied to all four edges of the perimeter of one of the sheets. The paper protecting the adhesive faces of the tape is removed from the bottom edge and both upright edges, and the second sheet of glass is laid in position on the first sheet so as to adhere to the tape. The two face toface sheets are then laid on an inclined tilting table, both sheets of glass are prised apart at their free edges and a funnel is inserted between them. 1 of silane A172 adhesion promotor is added to an amount ofUVAC 2721 Warwick Chemicals resin calculated as correct for filling the intersheet volume. 1 of methyl ethylKetone peroxide catalyst is then added to the resin silane mixture with gentle but thorough mixing and the mixture is allowed to stand until all air bubbles have escaped. The mixture is then poured slowly between the sheets through the funnel.When the mixture has settled in the lower part of the cavity the funnel is removed and a wedge inserted to keep the sheets apart. The protective paper is then removed from the tape at the top edge of the sheets and the table lowered until horizontal at the same time the space at the top is decreased. A pair of hollow needles having a bore of 0.6 mm are inserted through the tape, which at this time seals all round the sheets forming a closed but air permeable envelope, as shown in the drawing in which the upper sheet is 1, the tape is 2, the needles are 3 and the liquid resin is 4. The resin spreads across the envelope forcing the air in pockets 5 to escape through the needles 3. When the resin has approached close to the needles 3 ends within the envelope the needles 3 are withdrawn, and the weight of the sheet 1 causes the tape 2 to close the apertures formed on insertion of the needles 4. The remaining air in the pockets 5 permeates through the tape 2 until the entire intersheet space is filled with the resin 4. The resin is then allowed to cure and a bonded laminate is obtained.The needles 3 can if desired be connected to, for example, an air pump which runs continuously, and in this way rapid production of laminates can be made by positive suction of the air from many envelopes in succession or simultaneously.Modifications and improvements may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.
