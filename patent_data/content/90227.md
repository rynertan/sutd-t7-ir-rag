# A laminated insulation paper having a plastics portion with through holes and method of making the same.

## Abstract
A laminated insulation paper 30 having two cellulose layers 10, 12 separated by a plastics layer 20 is formed with through holes 24 in the plastics layer 20 such that the respective cellulose layers may contact one another via the through holes. The insulation paper 30 may be formed by pressing heated elements, such as rounded pins into one of the cellulose layers 10 while backing the other layer until the two cellulose layers are contacted through the hole 24 thus formed in the plastics layer.
