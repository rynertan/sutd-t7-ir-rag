# Voice messaging system with pitch tracking based on adaptively filtered LPC residual signal.

## Abstract
A voice messaging system, wherein linear predictive coding LPC parameters, pitch, and preferably other excita tion information is derived from a human voice input, encoded, and transmitted and or stored, to be called up later to provide a speech output which is nearly identical to the original speech input. The residual signal derived from LPC estimation is adaptively filtered, and then is used as the input to a conventional pitch estimation procedure. The adaptive filter ing step uses the first reflection coefficient k₁ to realize a simple filter e.g., A z 1 k₁ z ¹ ¹. This filter removes high frequency noise from the residual signal during voice periods, but does not remove the high frequency energy which contains important information during the unvoiced periods of speech. Preferably the above preprocessing technique is also combined with a postprocessing technique, wherein dyna mic programming is used to optimally track pitch and voicing through successive frames.
