# FLUID FLOW CONTROL VALVE

## Abstract
A valve which is arranged to output from a passage 12 a substantially constant rate flow of fluid, notwithstanding changes in the flow rate entering the valve by passage 11, is ar ranged to provide an output from passage 12 which is variable with the static pressure in that passage. Thus when the valve is used to supply a controlled flow to a hydraulic control system an increased flow rate to the system is provided to compen sate for increased leakage in the system resulting from a high er static pressure in the system.
