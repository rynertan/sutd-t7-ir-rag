# An optical sensing instrument.

## Abstract
An optical sensing instrument which works by detecting specular reflections of light from a surface under test has a sensor head 11 with a plane face 12 having a semi circular recess 13 in which are housed a plurality of light sources 14, 15, 16 and a plurality of photo detectors 17, 18, 19 each having an associated lens 14a to 19a the optical axis of each lens passes through the centre of curvature of the semi circular recess 13 . The photodetectors 17, 18, 19 and the light sources 14, 15, 16 are positioned with respect to one another such that for each light source 14 to 16 there is a photodetector 17 to 19 the optical axis of the associated lens 17a to 19a of which is inclined equally and oppositely to the optical axis of the lens 14a to 16a associated with the light source 14 to 16 across a normal to the plane face of the sensor head 11 passing through the centre of curvature of the recess 13 .
