# Improvements in and relating to coffee and tea making or brewing apparatus.

## Abstract
This invention relates to coffee and tea making apparatus which is capable of dispensing a predetermined volume of beverage, e.g., a cupful upon payment of a fee. It has been found necessary to vary the dispensing time depending upon the level of coffee within a holding tank within the tank. This, however, leads to problems. In accordance with the invention, a separate beverage re taining tank 48 is provided beneath a bed of ground coffee, tea leaves or the like, the beverage retaining tank having an outlet 52 in communication with a dispensing conduit with which is associated a dispensing valve 56 , operable to allow predetermined volumes of beverage to be dispensed from the beverage retaining tank through the dispensing conduit 54 .
