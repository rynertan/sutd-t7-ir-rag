# CABLE GLAND

## Abstract
This invention relates to armoured cable glands having an armour clamp comprising an armour spreading cone 3 having an outer surface which cooperates with a surface on the gland to grip the armouring of an armoured cable. The outer surface of the cone 3 decreases in diameter from the central region of the cone towards each end thereof. Preferably the outer surface of the cone 3 will take the shape of two truncated conical surfaces 4 , the surfaces 4 being axially convergent in a direction away from the central region of the cone. The cone 3 will form a kink in the end of armouring gripped by the gland in use.
