# Reticulated refractory metal structure and method for making.

## Abstract
A self supporting reticulate of titanium hydride TiH2 is formed by slurry coating an open cell organic synthetic resinous material, or other pore former, and eliminating the carbon containing components of binder and or solvent, viscosity modifiers, thickening agents, and the like at a temperature below about 400 DEG C. In an analogous manner, an inorganic refractory material open cell substrate or other pore former substrate may be slurry coated and converted to a TiH2 reticulate in which the substrate is coated with TiH2 to yield a supported TiH2 reticulate. Either the self supporting TiH2 reticulate, or the supported one, free of carbonaceous material may be sintered to yield an essentially pure Ti metal reticulate which is essentially free of titanium carbide. Ti reticulates so formed are coated with Pt group metal oxides and used as anodes in chloralkali cells.
