# Improved ultrasonic detector cell and system.

## Abstract
An orthoscopic ultrasonic imaging system which includes an acoustic transducer for insonifying an object to be inspected and an improved liquid crystal detector cell for receiving an imaging beam from the insonified object and for displaying a visible image. An electric, magnetic or acoustic biasing field is applied to the liquid crystal cell for raising the cell to an acousto optic threshold which permits detection and display of low intensify imaging signals. The cell surfaces which contact the liquid crystal material are treated so as to preferentially align the liquid crystal molecules for situations where electric or magnetic field biasing is used. Preferential alignment means that the longitudinal axis of the molecules are on average parallel to each other as indicated by the bulk director. Low intensity, acoustic fields e.g. less than 10 3 w cm 2 can be detected and displayed, and the object being examined can be insonified with low intensity ultrasonic beams.
