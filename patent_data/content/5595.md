# Laser flashtube power supply.

## Abstract
Power supply means for a laser flashtube F or similar lamp such as a continuous wave arc lamp consists of high frequency switch means S1 for providing a pulse train output from a direct current supply DC with provision for modulating the pulse width of said output and a filter LC which receives the modulated pulse train output for substantially removing high frequency ripple therefrom prior to passage of the resulting pulse envelope output to the flashtube F or similar lamp. Further high frequency switch means S2 may be provided for supplying a simmer current to the flashtube F or lamp or the modulated pulse train output may be raised on a pedestal for this purpose. The high frequency switch means S1 or S2 may consist of at least one transistor or thyristor and the filter LC may consist of an inductor capacitor arrangement.
