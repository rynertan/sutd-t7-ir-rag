# Multiple coating of fibers.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an improved method for forming two or more coating layers on a fiber. A first coating liquid is applied by an applicator having a die e.g. 101 that provides for the formation of a gap e.g. 103 between the die and the first coated layer. A second die e.g. 104 is located at the exit of the first die, with the second coating liquid flowing onto the fiber through a relatively narrow clearance e.g. 106 between the first and second dies. The clearance is formed by die surfaces perpendicular to the fiber axis. This second die also provides for a gap, e.g. 110 so that the second layer is applied at a free surface at the point of contact with the first coated layer. This approach eliminates turbulence and coating nonuniformities associated with prior art multiple coating techniques.
