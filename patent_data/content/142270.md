# Optical fibre thermometer and method of measuring temperature.

## Abstract
An optical fibre temperature thermometer uses a ther mochromic substance 7 having optical absorption peaks which vary with temperature within a first waveband, and having substantially constant absorption with temperature in a second waveband. The radiation 3 employed is in a wide band to include the first and second wavebands, and the radiation, reflected and attenuated as a result of the passage through the thermochromic substance, is split 15 into two selected beams F1,F2 and filtered in narrow band pass filters 21,23 for the first and second wavebands, to supply optical signals to respective detectors 17,19 whose outputs are divided 25 to produce a ratio signal representative of the temperature. The sensor is sufficiently compact for biomedi cal use, and, being unaffected by electromagnetic fields, is useful in regions of high tension or in microwave heating.

## Description
PPF3CaEZBBE E1PE ERI. BJclEHOPEIIIZSJJE EP3PEIBTUBE The present invention relates to an optical fibre thermometer, and to a method of measuring temperature using a probe.Optical fibre thermometers with temperature sensors based on various principles have already been proposed.Thermometers of this type lend themselves particularly to remote measuring in hostile or difficult access surroundings. Compared with more conventional devices, such as thermistors, thermocouples and the like, they have the advantage of being completely enclosed in a dielectric material, and as such are insensitive to electro magnetic fields. This is found to be necessary for example for taking measurements in appliances subject to high tension lines, transformers and other appliances or in particular applications in which use is made of microwave heating, such as industrial applications, biomedical applications hyperthermia , and so on.It is an object of the present invention to provide an optic fibre thermometer which has sensitivity, whose heat sensitive material is stable with time, which lacks hysteresis, and is not adversely affected by any fluctuations in the optical characteristics of parts of the thermometer external to the sensor and probe, especially the light source.The invention consists in an optical fibre thermometer having an end probe and an optical fibre for conveying light from a source to the end probe and thence to electro optical means for detecting temperature, characterised in that the end probe contains a thermo√ßhromis substance whose light absorption varies with temperature over a first wavelength range and remains substantially constant with temperature over a second wavelength range, and in that the electrooptical means responds to light transmitted through the thermochromic substance and through the optical fibre to detect the absorption of the first wavelength range relative to the second wavelength range, and to produce a signal indicative of the said relative absorption.The invention exploits the known phenomenon of photochromism, that is the property of a substance whereby its optical absorption spectrum varies as a function of its temperature.A method according to the invention of measuring temperature with a probe is characterised by transmitting light through a thermochromic substance within the probe and detecting the relative absorption of the light therein in two discrete wavebands, in only one of which the substance exhibits a thermochromic effect.The invention will be better understood from the following description of a preferred embodiment, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diagram of a fibre optic thermometer Figure 2 shows a possible construction of the temperature sensor of the thermometer of Figure 1 Figure 3 shows a temperature sensor and beam divider of an alternative form of thermometer Figure 4 is an absorption diagram as a function of wavelength of light transmitted through a thermochromic substance used in the thermometers of Figure 1 or 3 andFigure 5 is a graph showing the relationship between the thermometer output and the temperature being measured, for the thermometers of Figure 1 and 3.As shown in Figure 1, a thermometer has an optical fibre 1 which carries light through a chopper 5 from a wide band source 3, such as a halogen lamp, or from two sources LED s of different wavelengths, or from lamps with linear emission, right into the inside of a probe 7 containing a thermochromic solution. The light may be of any suitable wavelength, not necessarily visible.The probe 7 may be made, for example, using a capillary of glass 71 Fig.2 or other material with a diameter of the order of 1 to 2 mm, sealed and made specular at its end part 73 opposite the input of the optical fibre, and containing the thermochromic solution ST. The light, attenuated by the solution ST and reflected by the end part 73, is collected by another fibre 11 Fig.2 and despatched to a beamsplitter 15 from which two beams F1 and F2 emerge.Alternatively, the light, attenuated by the solution ST and reflected by the end part 73, is taken by the same fibre 1 Fig.3 and, through a star coupler 16 or other divider , divided into two beams F1 and F2 issuing from fibres 12 and 13. The two beams F1 andF2 are sent to respective photodetectors 17 and 19, which are photodiodes or similar devices, after having been filtered at two separate and specific wavelengths by respective filters 21 and 23 of different values.The values obtained from the two detectors 17 and 19 are despatched to a processor 25 which compares them, and which advantageously processes them to supply directly a value representative of the measured temperature.Depending on the temperature range concerned, the type of solution, and correspondingly the wavelengths selected by the two filters, are chosen accordingly.For the temperature range of interest in biomedicine from 300C to 500C it is appropriate to use a solution of cobalt halides CoC12.6B20 in a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and water. The absorption spectra of such a solution are given in Figure 4 where the graphs are plotted with wavelength in nanometres along the abscissae and absorption unity signifying total absorption along the ordinates, each graph corresponding to a different temperature. In the range 740 to 850 nm, light absorption by the solution remains constant as temperature changes, while the greatest variation with temperature occurs around the absorption peak of 660 nm.In the case analysed, the two filters 21,23 which are narrow band interferometers are selected to transmit respectively a first band centered on the absorption peak measurement channel , and a second band centered on a wavelength within the range 740 to 850 nm reference channel . With a view to eliminating the influence of the fluctuations common to the two channels a calculation is made of the ratio between the detected signals relating to the two channels. The measurements are thus independent, in particular, of any fluctuations of the source 3 and of the losses through the curvature of the optical fibres. The signal provided by the processor 25 is subsequently processed and displayed.The response of the thermometer constructed is shown inFigure 5 which is a graph of reference temperature along the abscissa, against the resulting ratio, along the ordinate. The processing done by the processor 25 optionally corrects for the slight non linearity of the response, using conventional calibration methods. Because of the possibility of using several probes employing thermochromic substances different from cobalt halides, the thermometer under consideration may cover a fairly wide temperature range to suit various applications, such as the monitoring of electric, electronic or mechanical equipment,microwave ovens,etc. By virtue of the reduced dimensions to, which the thermometer may be made, it is suitable also for medical applications, such as e.g. measuring blood temperature inside arteries or hyperthermia of various natures. In the case of medical applications in particular it is necessary to make as miniaturised a probe as possible, to be able to take local temperature measurements and to limit trauma in the body.
