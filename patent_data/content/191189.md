# Spinning type multiple roller forming machine.

## Abstract
In a multiple roller spinning machine for spinning one piece vehicle wheels the roller holder 22 is capable of sliding in a direction parallel with the axis of spinning and has a hydraulic cylinder 41 which moves through its piston rod the holder horizontally thereby bringing the multiple rollers 34, 35, 36 sequentially in an operating position just above the wheel material 12 clamped between the dies 18 and 13 of the driving 17 and driven 15 spindles. Each roller is coupled to a control hydraulic cylinder 38, 39, 40 which drives through its piston the respective roller verti cally between a retracted position and a drawing position where the roller is pressed against the periphery of the wheel material 12 . According to another embodiment, the holder carries therein multiple rows of different forming rollers arranged radially about a common center such that the wheel material can be subject to drawing by multiple rollers simultaneously applied at different points about the material periphery.
