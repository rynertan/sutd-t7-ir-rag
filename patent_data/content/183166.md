# Dual mode laser printer.

## Abstract
A dual mode laser printer utilizes a program controlled microprocessor to switch between a high resolution, slow speed mode and a low resolution, high speed mode. In the printer a laser beam is modulated at a rate which is a first division of a system clock rate. This beam is caused to focus on a recording medium and, due to a rotating multi faceted polygon, the beam sweeps across the medium. The medium is moved according to a second division of the system clock. By means of the microprocessor, the printer can be in either 1 the high resolution mode in which the laser beam is modulated at a high rate due to the first divided signal and the medium moves at a slow rate due to the second divided signal, or 2 the low resolution mode in which the light beam is modulated at a lower rate due to the first divided signal and the medium moves at a faster rate due to the second divided signal.
