# Method of forming photovoltaic quality amorphous alloys by passivating defect states.

## Abstract
Relatively dense, photovoltaic quality amorphous alloys which are characterised by reduced density of defect states in the band gap thereof and which are particularly suited for use in tandem photovoltaic devices are formed by evaporat ing amorphous germanium and amorphous silicon in an ultrahigh vacuum environment, diffusing a density of states reducing element into and through the amorphous material, and finally annealing the resultant amorphous alloy to complete the diffusion process. The amorphous alloy, so formed, is a substantially contaminant free, substantially tetrahedrally coordinated material. Fluorine is the preferred density of states reducing element whicn is added to the amorphous material for reducing the density of states througn compensation, and for orbital promotion and expan sion.
