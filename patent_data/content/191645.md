## Description
Recording Medium and Recording Method by Use ThereofBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to a recording medium to be used preferably for ink jet recording method, particularly to a recording medium excellent in ink receptivity and giving sharpness and water resistance of the recorded image.Description of the Related Art Ink jet recording method performs recording by generating small droplets of ink according to various ink recording liquid discharging systems, such as an electrostatic attraction system, a system of giving mechanical vibration or displacement to ink by use of a piezoelectric element a system utilizing pressure of bubbles formed by heating ink and permitting ink droplets to fly and attach a part or whole thereof onto a recording medium such as paper. This method is now attracting attention as a recording method which generates less noise and is capable of performing high speed printing and multi ocior printing. For ink jet recording, inks have been used which is composed mainly of water in view of safety and recording characteristics. In most cases, a polyhydric alcohol is added to inks for the purpose of prevention of clogging of nozzles and improvement of discharging stability. As recording media to be used for the ink jet recording method, there have been employed recording media comprising a porous ink receiving layer provided on an ordinary paper or a substrate called as the ink jet recording paper. However, as the ink jet recording is improved in performance such as speed up or multicoloring of recording and is widely spread, higher and broader charactwistics are demanded also for the recording medium. More specifically, the recording medium for ink jet recording for obtaining recorded images of high resolution and high quality needs to satisfy various basic requirements as follows 1 reception of ink onto the recording medium should be as rapid as possible 2 even when ink dots may be overlapped with each other, the ink attached later should not flow into the dot attached earier 3 ink droplets should not diffuse on the recording medium and not become larger in ink dot diameter than is necessary 4 the shape of an ink dot should be approximate to a true circle and its circumference should be smooth 5 OD optical density of an ink dot should be high, without obscurity around the dot etc. Further, for obtaining a recorded image quality of high resolution comparable to color photography by the multi color ink jet recording method, the following performances are further required in addition to the above requisite perfor manses 6 the colorants of ink should be excellent in color forming property 7 ink fixing characteristic should be excellent since liquid droplets of the same number as that of ink colors may possibly attached on the same spot to overlap each other 8 the surface should have gloss 9 the degree of whiteness should be high. Further, while the recorded images obtained by the ink jet recording method have been employed in the past exclusively for surface image observation, recording media suited for uses other than for surface image observation are demanded more with improvement in performances or wide spreading of the ink jet recording device. Uses of the recording medium other than for surface image observation may include these in which recorded images are projected onto a screen, etes by means of an optical instrument such as a slide or an OHP overhead projector , etc. and those in which images are observed by means at color resolution plates during preparation af a positive plate for color printing, and a CMF a color mosaic filter , ete to be used for color display such as liquid crystal, ete The transmitted light through the recorded images becomes a problem in the recording medium in these uses, which is different from the uses for surface image observation where diffused light mainly from a recorded image is observed Accordingly, light bransmissivity, particularly excellent linear transmittance is required in addition to the requisite performances in general of the recording medium for ink jet recording. Prior to the present invention, however, no recording medium has not been known which satisfies all of these requisite performances. Most of the recording media for surface image observation of the prior art have employed a system in which a porous ink receiving layer is provided on the surface and the recording agent is fixed by reception of the ink into the porous voids, and hence the surface of the recording medium lacks gloss due to the porous structure. On the other hand, in the surface of non porous ink receiving layer, a non volatile component such as polyhydric alcohol, etc. in the ink will remain even after recording on the surface of the recording medium for a long time, whereby drying for fixing ink is prolonged, this invoiving the drawbacks such that clothings may be soiled by contact with the recorded images or that the recorded images may be damaged. Further, in the case of a recording medium employing a water soluble polymer for formation of an ink receiving layer in order to enhance the affinity and receptivity for ink, the surface of the ink receiving layer becomes sticky under highly humid conditions, whereby the problems arises such that it is adhered onto the delivery roller when mounted on a printer, thus failing to be conveyed, and also that the recording medium will be subject to blocking when placed one upon another. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a recording medium for use in ink jet recording which is particularly excellent in ink receptivity and giving water resistance and sharpness of recorded image. Another object of the present invention is to provide a recording medium for use in full color ink jet recording which is excellent in ink receptivity, and giving sharpness of recorded image and surface gloss, and also free from stidciness of the surface. blocking. etc. even under highly humid conditions. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a recording medium for use in ink jet recording. which can be used for observation by projection of recorded image by means of an optical instrument such as a slide or an OHP, or which can be used for observation of transmitted light such as a color resolution plate during preparation d a positive plate for color printing or a CMF, etc. to be used for color display such as liquid crystal. The above and other objects of the present invention can be accomplished by the present invention as described bebw. Aaading to the prevent invention, tt b provided a recording medium which comprises having an ink receiving layer containing a polymer complex of a basic polymer and en acidic polymer. In another aspect of the present invention, there is also provided a recording method which performs recording by fuming liquid droplets of a recording liquid and permitting the liquid droplets to be attached on the surface of a recording medium, wherein the recording liquid is an aqueous ink and the surface of the recording medium contains a poymer complex of a basic polymer and an acidic polymer.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EM BODIMENTS To describe in detail about the present invention, the recording medium of the present invention is charactrized princi ty in that its ink receiving layer compises a polymer complex of a basic polymer and an acidic polymer and the objects of the present invention can be accomplished primarity by such a characteristic. The recording medium of the present invention genorally comprises a substrate as the supporting material and a recording surface, namely an ink receiving layer, provided on its surface.

The polymer complex which charactenzes principally the present invention compnses a basic polymer and an acidic copolymer. In the prior art polymer complexes comprising a basic polymer and an acidic polymer are known as disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 37017 1976 and 42744 1980.

Particularly useful in the present invention are homopolymers and copolymers of N vinylpyrrolidone, N vinylpiperidone, N vinylcaprolactam, N vinylmoroholine. N vinyl 2 oxazolidone, N vinyl 5 methyl 2 oxazolidone, etc.The nitrogen containing monomer as described above in the copolymers is preferably contained in an amount of 50 mole or more. On the other hand, the acidic polymer capable of forming a polymer complex with the above basic polymer may include, for example, polymers shown below. The acidic polymer in the present invention is also inclusive of those having alcoholic hydroxyl groups, other than those having sulfonic acid groups. carboxylic acid groups, sulfunc acid ester groups. phosphoric acid ester groups, or phenolic hydrovi groups in its molecule. 1. Polymers having carboxylic acid groups Carboxyl terminated polyesters obtained by the reaction of polycarboxylic acids such as citric acid, tartaric acid, phthalic acid with poiyhydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol, 1.4 butane diol. diethylene glycol, etc. in the presence of acids in excess. Acidic cellulose derivatives modified with various kinds of polycarboxylic acids see Japanese Patent Publication No. 5093 1960 Homopolymers or random copolymers, block copolymers or graft copolymers with other monomers in general of vinyl ether ester monomers of polycarboxylic acids, etc. see Japanese Patent Publication No. 8495 1 960 Homopolymers or random copolymers, block copolymers or graft copolymers with other monomers in general of vinyl ether ester monomers of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, etc. Homopolymers or random copolymers, block copolymers or graft copolymers with other monomers in general of a, ss unsaturated vinyl monomers such as maleic anhydride, itaconic acid, etc see Gosei Kobunshi SyntheticPolymer III , edited by Murahashi, Inoue, Tani, p.250 257 and p.374 380, published by Asakura Shoten, 1971 2.Polymers having sulfonic acid groups Cellulose derivatives such as O ethyiceiluose acetate hydrogen sulfate hydrogen phthalate, cellulose acetate hydrogen sulfate hydrogen phthalate, ethylcellulose hydrogen O sulfobenzoate, O P sulfonbenzylcellulose acetate, 0 ethyl O P suWoethyicelluEose acetate, etc. see JapanesePatent Publication No. 509311960 Sulfonic acid modii ied polymers of polyvinyl alcohol or vinyl alcohol copolymer with subtonic acid compounds e.g. O sullobenzoic acid, sulfopropionic acid, sulfovaleric acid, sulfobenzaldehyde, sulfophthalic acid, etc. 3. Polymers having hydroxyl group Ethylcellulose, benzylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxyethyl ethylcellulose, hydroxyethyl benzylcellulose, etc. Other homopolymers, random copolymers, block copolymers or graft copolymers with other monomers in general with other monomers having sulfonic acids or phe nol groups Various acidic modified polymers with ether compounds containing carboxylic groups, sullonic acid groups or phenol groups As the phenolic acidic polymers, there may be included specifically these having phendic hydroxyl groups in their main chains antilor side chains. Such phenolic acidic polymers may include so called phenol resins or initial condensates thereof obtained by addition condensation reaction of monomers of phenols having hydroxyl groups in the aromatic ring such as phenol, m cresol, 3,5 xylenol, p alkylphenol, resorcin, a or ss naphthol, etc. or derivatives thereof with an aldehyde such as formalin. These polymers may be either homopoiymers or copolymers, which may be either random, block or graft copolymers. Such phenolic acidic polymers may have various mosecular weights from relatively lower molecular weights which are soluble in water or organic solvents to those with higher molecular weights which are insoluble and unmel table. In the present invention, those sduble in water, organic solvents such as alcohol, ketone, etc., for example, initial condensates of phenol resins are particularly useful. These phendic acidic polymers are generality hydrophilic, but they are hard and can form only brittle coated films, and therefore are not applicable at all for the ink receiving layer of a recording medium. However, through formation of a complex with a basic polymer as described above, ink receiving layers having various excellent performances can be formed. As the polymer having phenolic hydroxyl groups in the side chain, there may be included polymers or copolymers with other monomers in general of vinyl monomers having phenolic hytiroxyl groups such as vinylphenol. vinyinaphthol, etc. further modified polymers of polymers in general having functional groups such as hydroxyl groups, carboxyl groups, amino groups, etc. modified with compounds having phenolic hydroxyl groups, which can be used similarly as the phenol resins as described above. Any of the acidic polymers as described above can preferably be used The present inventors have investigated comprehen lively the mixtures of the basic polymers and acidic polymers as described above. and found that mixing of these polymers in a solution gives a polymer complex different from either starting polymer through some interaction between both polymers, and mixing of both polymers in a relatively poor solvent resuits in precipitation of the polymer complex, while mixing in a relatively good solvent results in marked increase of the viscosity, thus giving a mixture having properties different from those of a simple mixture of both polymers employed. Accordingly, the term polymer complex to be used in the present invention means a polymer complex comprising polymers as described above as to details about basic polymers, acidic polymers and polymer complexes comprising these polymers, see Japanese Patent Publication No.3701711976 and Japanese Patent Publication Na 42744 1980 . The present inventors have further investigated com prehensively uses of these polymer complexes, and found that these polymer complexes, although they are markedly hydrophilic, are resistant to water and humidity and exhibit ink receptivity comparable to that of water soluble polymers of the prior art to give sharp images, and yet their surfaces will not become sticky even under highly humid conditions.Further, it has also been found that, when a phenolic polymer is used as the acidic polymer, the strength at the portion which has received ink becomes more strong, and the film will not easily be peeled off nor broken even when touched with a finger or a thing. Because of general insolubility of the above mentioned polymer complexes in a relatively poor solvent such as waster, alcohols, esters, and hydrocarbons, the polymer complex of the present invention may be isdated by dis solving each of the starting polymers in a poor sdvent respectively and then mixing both solutions On the other hand, a solution of a polymer complex can be obtained by dissolving the starting polymers in a relatively good solvent such as dmethyHormamide, dimethylacetamide, dimethylsul foxide, etc. Preferable basic polymers and acidic polymers for formation of a polymer complex as described above may be those having respective molecular weights of 500 or more, preferably 1,000 or mwe, and an ink receiving layer with great strength excellent in ink receptivity giving sharpness of the image, water resistance and ink resistance can be formed from both types of polymers of such molecular weights. The proportion of both polymers to be employed may be within the range of 20 1 to 1110 in terms of weight ratio of basic polymer to acidic polymer, preferably a ratio at which the basicity and the acidity of the respective copolymers are approximately equal. Outside the range of the above weight ratio, bonding between both polymers will be insuffident, whereby the objects of the present invention cannot fully be achieved. For example, With a large excess of the basic polymer, water resistance will be reduced, while with a large excess of the acidic polymer, Ink receptivity will be reduced. As disclosed in Japanese Laid open Patent PublicationNo. 174382 1984, for further improvement of mk fixing charactenstic and stickiness on the surface at the printed portion, a condensation product of D sorbitol and benzaldehyde may be added to the above polymer complex at a proportion of 0.1 to 50 by weight The ink receiving layer of the recording medium of the present invention can be formed by use of the polymer complex as described above, but it is also possible in the present invention to use additionally other polymers than the polymer complex as described above, for example, other light transmissive polymers in combmation with the above polymer complex. Preferred as such other polymers are natural resins such as albumin, gelatin, cased, starch, cationic starch.gum arabic, sodium alginate, etc. and synthetic resins such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyamide, polyacrylamide, quaternanzed polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethyleneimine, polyvinyl pyridinium halide, melamine resin, polyurethane, polyester, sodium polyacrylate, etc. At least one of these materials may be used in combination, if desired. Further, for reinforcement of the ink receiving layer and or improvement of adhesion of the layer to substrate, resins such as SBR latex, NBR latex, polyvinylformal, polymethyl methacrylate, polyvinylbutyral, polyacrylonitrile, poly vinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate, phenol resin, alkyd resin may also be used in combination, if necessary. For improvement of ink absorptivity of the ink receiving layer, it is possible to disperse fillers such as silica. clay, talc, diatomaceous earth, calcium carbonate, calcium sul fins, barium sulfate, aluminum silicate, synthetic zeolite, alumina, zinc oxide, lithopon, satin white, etc. in the ink receiving layer. As for the substrate to be used as the supporting malarial for the ink receiving layer in the present invention, it may be any substrate known in the art, transparent or opaque. Preferable examples of transparent substrates may include films or plates such as of polyester resins, diacetate resins, polycarbonate resins, polyvinyl chloride resins, p mide resins, cellophane, celluloid, etc. and glass plates. Pre erable opaque substrates may include. for example, paper, cloth, wood, metal plate, synthetic paper in general, or otherwise the above transparent substrates which have been made opaque according to known means. The recording medium of the present invention is fonned by use of the main materials as described above. In the preferable embodiment 1 as mentioned above, both of the substrate and the ink receiving layer are light transmis sive, with the linear transmittance being 10 or higher, and it is an embodiment in which the recording medium as a whose is light transmissive. The recording medium of this embodiment is particu lanky excellent m light transmissity and employed primarily in the uses such as an OHP, etc. in which recorded image is projected onto a screen, etc. by means of an optical instrument, thus being useful for observation with transmitted slight Such a light transmissive recording medium can be prepared by forming a light transmissive ink receiving layer from a polymer complex as described above alone or a mixture of this polymer complex with another light transmis sive polymer on the light transmissive substrate as described above. As the method for forming such an ink receiving iayer, there may preferably be employed a method m which a 0084 solution Is prepared by ciissog or dispersing the above polymer complex or a mixture with another appropirate polymer and said solution is coated on the light transmissive substrate according to the known method such as roll coating, rod bar coating, spray coating, air knife coating, etc., followed by rapid drying, or a method in which one solution of either the basic polymer or the acidic polymer is applied and then the other solution to form a polymer complex on the substrate.It is also possibie to use the method in which the above polymer complex alone or a mixture together with another polymer is subjected to hot melt coating or the method in which a single sheet for ink receiving layer is once formed from the matenal as described above, and said sheet is lammated on the above substrate. The recording medium according to the embodiment 1 formed as described above is a light transmissive recording medium having sufficient light transmissivity. The sufficient light transmissivity as herein mentioned means that the linear transmittance of the recording medium should desirably exhibit at least 2 , preferably 10 or higher. If the linear transmittance is 2 or higher, the recorded image can be observed by projection by, for example, an OHP onto a screen. Further, in order for the fine potion of the recorded image to be observed sharply, the linear transmittance should desirably be 10 or higher. The linear transmittance T as herein mentioned Is a value which is determined by measuring the spectral transmittance of the linear light which enters a sample perpendicularly, transmits through the sample, passes through a slit on the light receiving side which is located at least 8 am apart form the sample on the line extended from the incident light pathway and is received on a detector, by means of, for example, 323 Model Hitach Automatic Recording Spectrophotometer produced by Hitachi, Ltd. , further determining the Y value of tristimulus values of color and calculating from the following formula T e Y Yo X 100 1 T Linear transmittanceY Y value of sampleYo Y value of blank Thus, the linear transmittance as mentioned in the present invention is relative to linear light, and it is different from difhee transmittance transmittance is determined so as to be inclusive of diffused light by providing an integrating sphere at the back of a sample or opacity determined from the ratio of values when white and biack backings are placed on the back of a sample according to the method in which light transmissivity is evaluated with diffused light Since what becomes as problem in an instrument utilizing optical techniques is the behavior of linear light, it is particularly important to determine the linear transmittance of a recording medium in evaluation of the light transmis sn,ity of the recording medium to be used in such an instrument For example, in the case of observing a projected image by OHP, in order to obtain an image with high contrast between the recorded portion and the non recorded portion, sharp and easy to see, the non recorded portion in the projected Image is required to be light, namely the linear transmittance of the recording medium should be at a certain level or higher. In the test using a test chart in anOHP, for obtaining an image suited for the above purpose, the linear transmittance of the recording medium needs to be 2 or higher, preferably 10 or higher in order to obtain a sharper image. Therefore, the recording medium suited for this purpose is required to have a linear transmittance which is at least 2 . The embodiment 2 as mentioned above is also a modification of the above embodiment 1 , and it is characterized by that the surface of its ink receiving layer is smooth and has a 45 degree minor surface gloss of at least 30 based on JIS Z8741. The recording medium of sed type is particularly excellent in surface gloss and particularly useful as a recording medium for observation of a surface image which is of full color and excellent in sharpness. The recording medium according to this embodiment may be either transparent or opaque, and any of the above transparent and opaque materials can be used. Also, the ink receiving layer may be either transparent or opaque. The materials and the method to be used for formation of the ink receivng layer may be the same as described above embodiment 1 , but the above mentioned fillers can be used even to the extent such that the ink receiving layer may become opaque, provided that the surface of the ink receiving layer can retain its smoothnesis. Further, if desired, in addition to the coating methods as described above, it is also possible to employ the cast coating method or to effect glossing by means of calender rolls. In the present invention as described above, the ink receiving layer to be formed on the substrate may have a thickness of generally 1 to 200 corm, preferably 3 to 100 um, more preferably 5 to 30 um. Further, in the present invention, organic or inorganic fine powder imparted at a proportion of abut 0.01 to about 1.0 glum on the recording surface of the recording medium of various embodiments as described above will further improve the conveying characteristic within the printer, antiblocking characteristic during piling, fingerprint resistance, etc. of the recording medium obtained. Having described above by referring to examples of typical embodiments of the recording medium of the present invention, the recording medium of the present invention will not of course be limited to these embodiments. In either of these embodiments, the ink receiving layer and or the ink permeable layer may contain various known additives, ineluding dispersing agents, fluorescent dyes, pH controllers, defoaming agents, lubricants, preservatives, surfactants, etc. The recording medium of the present invention is not necessarily required to be colorless, but it may also be a colored recording medium. The recording medium of the present invention can exhibit excellent ink receptivity similarly as that having an ink receiving layer formed with a water soluble polymer of the prior art and provide a recorded image of excellent sharpness, with its surface not becomig tacky or sticky. Thus, even when inks with different colors may be attached on the same spot to overlap each other within a short time, there is no such phenomenon as flowing out or oozing out, whereby the ink receiving layer will not reduce its strength and a sharp image can be obtained with high resolution. Moreover, since the recording medium of the present invention does not become tacky or sticky on the surface of the ink receiving layer, being different from the recording medium using a water soluble polymer of the prior art, even when recording as described above may be performed under highly hjmW condisions SI will be cluasel no trouble in the printer neither blocking nor color transfer occurs when they are placed one upon another. Such excellent effects under highly humid conditions may be considered to be due to formation of a polymer complex through generation of some weak bonding between the molecules of the two kinds of the polymers used for formation of the ink receiving layer such as elecrostetic force between ions, hydrogen bonding, Van der Wadis force, partial charge transfer, etc., thus exhibiting excellent water resistance even under highly humid conditions, while retaining high ink receptivity. It has been entirely unexpected that such excellent effects as described above can be accomplished by a water insoluble polymer complex. This may be considered to be due to the fact that the ink consisting of a water poiyhydric alcohol mixture system will promote reception of ink imparted by temporarily dissolving or swelling the ink receiving layer of the recording medium without lowering its film strength and, after reception, the ink receiving layer will be returned to the original water msoluble polymer complex through absorotion and evaporation of moisture. Such a theory is a mere speculation and will be in no way restric tive of the present invention. In the present invention, it is also possible to provide a recording medium excellent in surface gloss which has not been found in the recording medium for ink jet recording of the prior art. Further, it can be appiied for uses other than surface image observation of the prior art such as for observation by projection of a recorded image by an optical instrument such as a slide, an OHP, etc, a color resolution plate during preparation of a positive plate for color printing, or a CMF, etc. to be used for color display such as liquid crystal, etc. The present invention is described in more detail by referring to the following Exampies, in which parts are based on weightExample 1 An amount of 66 parts of an aqueous 10 polyvinyl pyrrolidone solution PVPK 90, produced by GAF was mixed with 34 parts of an aqueous 10 solution of a methyl vinyl ether maleic anhydride copolymer GANTREZ AN 769, produced by GAF .

The respective evaluation items in Table 1 were mea ailed following the methods as described bestow. 1 Ink fixing time was determined by leaving the recording medium after recording to stand at room temperature and measuring the time for ink drying to such a degree that the ink does not stick a touched finger. 2 Dot density was measured for black dots by means ofSakura Microdensitometer PDM 5 produced by KonishirokuPhoto Industry K.K. by applying JIS K7505 for printed microdots. 3 OHP adaptability was evaluated as a typical example of an optica instrument The recorded image was projected byOHP onto a screen, and judged by visual observation. One which can provide a projected image which is light at non recorded portion, high in OD optical density of recorded image, sharp and easy to see with high contrast was rated as O one which can provide a projected image which is aiiglnlv rX at non recorded portian, siohtiy low in OD of recorded image and not clearly discriminable between the lines with a pitch width of 0.5 mm and a boldness of 0.25 mm was rated as A one which can provide a projected image which is considerably dark at non recorded portion, considerably low in recorded image and not clearly discrimi naSe between the lines with a pitch width of 1 mm and a boidness of 0.3 mm, or which is indiscriminable between non recorded portion and recorded image, was rated as x. 4 Linear transmittance was determined by measuring the spectral transmittance by means of 323 Model Hitach Automatic Recording Specrophotometer produced by Hitachi,Ltd. while maintaining the distance from the sample to the window on the light receiving side at about 9 cm and calculating from the formula 1 mentioned above. 5 Conveying performance was rated as x, when the recording medium could not be conveyed with the delivery roller of the printer due to stickiness on the ink receiving layer surface when it was mounted on the printer under the conditions of 35 C and 85 RH, or otherwise as O. 6 Blocking was evaluated by placing a pure paper In close contact on the printed surface one hour after followed by storage for 12 hours, and rated as 0 when no adhesion occuned between the recording medium and the pure paper, or otherwise as x. If no adhesion occurred even when the same test was conducted 10 minutes after printing, it was rated as 7 Formation of polymer complex was evaluated by the presence of abrupt increase of viscosity or formation of gel when the respective solutions of a basic polymer and a phenolic acidic polymer were mixed together as being 0, or otherwise as x. The results of evaluation of the recording media ofExamples 9 12 and Comparative examples 1 2 are shown in Table 2. Measurements of evaluation items in Table 2 were also conducted for the item 8 in addition to the above items 1 7 . 8 Film strength was evaluated by rubbing the surface of the solid printed portion of the ink receiving layer with a finger 5 minutes after printing, and rated as x when the coating lacked strength and is peeled off from the base film or broken at the image, or otherwise as O.Table 1 Table 2EMI12.1 tb SEP Example tb SEP 1 SEP 2 SEP 3 SEP 4 SEP 5 SEP 6 SEP 7 SEP 8 tb SEP SEP N SEP SEP O SEP rt SEP O SEP O SEP O tb SEP SEP É SEP o SEP C SEP ds SEP t SEP SEP 0 SEP O tb SEP vo SEP C SEP SEP C SEP rs SEP C SEP 0 SEP O tb 10 SEP 5 SEP 3 SEP 10 SEP 3 SEP 5 SEP 5 SEP 2 tb Ink SEP fixing SEP time SEP min.
