# Process for synthesizing a multicomponent acidic catalyst composition containing zirconium by an organic solution method.

## Abstract
A process for preparing a catalyst composition wherein a Metal Hydrocarboxide I, such as aluminum secbutoxide, a Metal Hydrocarboxide II, such as zirconium butoxide, an acidic phosphorus oxygen composition, such as phosphoric acid, and water, are reacted in the presence of a liquid organic medium, such as acetone, to form a catalyst precur sor composition, which is then calcined to form the catalyst, is disclosed. The catalyst is useful for condensing carboxylic acids or their ester with aldehydes or acetals to synthesize α,β ethylenically unsaturated acids or esters, such as methylmethacrylate.
