# Brush components and their manufacture.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing brush components is dis closed wherein an array of bristles 1 which may either be loosely arranged in which case they should be substantially aligned or may be in the form of a knitted or woven tape is over lain by a membrane 3 e.g. a polythene or polypropylene sheet, the bristles and membrane then being bent through 180 about the centre line of the array into a generally U shaped configuration and subsequently held in that position by clamping means e.g. a metal channel 7 or an extruded plastics beading 9 . Preferably a strengthening wire 5 is lo cated over the top of the membrane and within the U at the base thereof.
