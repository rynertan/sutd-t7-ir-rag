## Description
DETERMINING THE DEGREE OF COOKING IN A SULPHITE DIGESTER FOR DELIGNIFICATION This invention relates to methods of and apparatus for determining the degree of cooking in a sulphite digester for delignification. The invention can be used, for example, in the pulp industry. Lignin is the major noncarbohydrate constituent of wood. It functions as a natural plastic binder for the cellulose fibres. Its exact formula is unknown. Lignin is removed from wood by both the sulphite and sulphate pulp processes. It is known that the rate of delignification is a function of cooking liquor composition and cooking temperature, and that this rate increases rapidly with temperature and is affected by acid concentration. It is further known that the rate of delignification for acid pulping varies with temperature in accordance with the known Arrhenius equation. The velocity factor reaction rate k can be determined from this equation and subsequently substituted in the standard rate of delignification equation to determine this latter rate. The prior art is primarily concerned with processes associated with wood pulping delignification. US Patent No. 3 523 060 Herdel et al discloses a modification of the sulphite pulping processes wherein a very large quantity of sulphur dioxide is utilised and the delignification step is forced by utilising a very high temperature. US Patent No. 4 295 929 Leithem is directed to the same process, but in this case the proportion of combined sulphur dioxide used in the digestion process is varied as a function of the rate of heating. In essence,US 4 295 929 teaches that an increase in the proportion of sulphur dioxide used in the digestion process combined with an increase in the heating rate allows a considerable shortening of the total digestion time. US 3 523 060 and US 4 295 929 are thus directed to variations of the sulphite digestion process in order to shorten the total digestion time. US Patent No. 2 545 389 Somer et al discloses apparatus for increasing the sulphur dioxide content of the cooking acid used in the foregoing process. There is an inverse relation between sulphur dioxide content and total digestion time. US 2 545 389 is thus directed to the apparatus for increasing the sulphur dioxide content of the cooking acid rather than to the process itself. According to the invention there is provided a method of determining the degree of cooking in a delignification sulphite digester, the method being characterised by sensing the digester temperature, sensing the digester pressure, providing values corresponding to a plurality of constants including an energy of activity constant for the digester reaction and the gas constant, continuously calculating the digester reaction rate of the sulphite digester as a function of digester temperature and pressure and the constants, to obtain a value thereof over time, obtaining a value corresponding to a partial pressure of sulphur dioxide in the digester as a function of digester pressure and temperature, multiplying the partial pressure of sulphur dioxide value by the reaction rate value to obtain a delignification rate value, and integrating the delignification rate value over a time to establish a value corresponding to the degree of cooking in the digester. The invention also provides apparatus for accomplishing the foregoing method including individual function blocks which are connected together to achieve the various calculations. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided apparatus for determining the degree of cooking in a sulphite digester for delignification, the apparatus being characterised by a first sensor for sensing a digester temperature a second sensor for sensing a digester pressure a first controller module connected to the first and second sensors and having means for providing a plurality of constants including an energy of activity constant for the digester reaction and the gas constant means in the first controller module for continuously calculating a digester reaction rate of the digester as a function of digester temperature, pressure, and the plurality of constants to obtain values therefor over time means in the first controller module for obtaining a value corresponding to the partial pressure of sulphur dioxide in the digester as a function of the digester temperature and pressure at least one multiplier in the first controller module for multiplying the partial pressure value by the digester reaction rate value to obtain a delignification rate value and a second controller module connected to the first controller module for receiving the delignification rate value and integrating the delignification rate value over time to obtain a Kappa value of cooking in the digester. A preferred embodiment of the present invention described hereinbelow provides a method and apparatus for calculating sulphite digester rate of delignification and determining the completion of cooking, utilising function blocks to continuously solve the so called Arrhenius equation for the velocity factor reaction. This calculation takes place in the first controller module with the second controller module being provided with function blocks to obtain a value corresponding to the rate of delignification. The delignification rate is continuously computed and monitored, and when the cook has been brought up to a desired set point, an indication, such as an alarm, is provided to an operator to terminate the cooking process. By using simple function blocks, a digital computer, with its corresponding expensive programming and equipment, is avoided.An analog computer or device, known to have accuracy and flexibility problems, is also avoided. The preferred apparatus for and methods of determining the degree of cooking in a sulphite digester are simple in design, rugged in construction, and economical to manufacture. The invention will now be further described, by way of illustrative and non limiting example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a block diagram of one embodiment of the invention showing the use of two modules having plural function blocks Figure 2 is a block diagram of an Arrhenius equation module shown in the diagram of Figure 1 and Figure 3 is a curve showing reaction rate plotted against time, graphically illustrating how the area under this curve is calculated for establishing a degree of cooking in a sulphite digester. The drawings show apparatus embodying the Invention for determining the degree of cooking in a delignification sulphite digester. The rate of delignification is primarily a function of the cooking liquor composition and cooking temperature. Since there are established mathematical expressions for the rate of delignification, it is possible to determine how much cooking time is required based upon the cooking temperature for a particular pulp quality. See Pulp and Paper Manufacture, 2nd Ed., Volume I, The Pulpinq of Wood, pp 282 to 285. The rate of delignification increases rapidly with increasing temperature, but the effect is altered by the acid concentration. The rate of delignification for acid pulping varies with temperature in accordance with the Arrhenius equation E log k A 2.303 RT 1 where k measure of the reaction rate A constant E energy of activity approximately 21 Kcal T digester temperature Kelvins andR gas constant 1.987 Cal C . The rate of reaction is a little more than doubled by an increase of 10 0C in temperature. Cooking is extremely slow at temperatures below 100 C. Figure 1 illustrates how calculation of the digester rate of delignification and Kappa K Number can be implemented in a BaileyNETWORK 90 Trade Mark system. The entire delignification rate and Knumber calculation can be accomplished using two NETWORK 90 controller modules 10, 30 for a particular digester. Information concerning theNETWORK 90 can be found in Bailey Controls Company Application Guide 260 2 and Bailey Controls Company Product Specification E93 906. In the first controller module 10, the Arrhenius equation can be continuously solved for the velocity factor reaction rate k , by means of a calculator unit or module 23 shown in greater detail in Figure 2. The calculation is based upon digester temperature measurement as determined by a digester temperature transmitter 12 which provides one of a plurality of inputs to the unit 23. The rate of delignification dL dt at any instant for a sulphite batch digester is expressed as follows Rate k p 5 2 n 2 where k velocity factor reaction rate varying with temperature according to the Arrhenius equation n constant less than unity and P SO2 partial pressure of sulphur dioxide in the digester digester pressure minus steam pressure at digester temperature . The partial pressure of sulphur dioxide in the digester is approximated by measuring the difference between steam pressure at the digester temperature and the actual digester pressure. This partial pressure is linearised and corected for the assumption that the digester pressure is that of only steam and sulphur dioxide in equilibrium with the digester acid.Steam pressure is calculated as a function of temperature in a unit 14 and the actual pressure is supplied by a digester pressure transmitter 15. The difference between the steam pressure and digester pressure is taken in a comparator unit 16. The n power factor in Equation 2 is provided by a function generator 17 and provides a means for compensating for the foregoing assumption. The constants A, E, 2.303 and R of Equation 1 are provided to the unit 23 by units 18, 19, 20 and 21, respectively. An output log k from the unit 23 is integrated to provide k and multiplied by the partial pressure output value from the function generator 17 to provide an output from the controller module 10 which represents the rate of delignification at any instant for the sulphite digester, in accordance withEquation 2 , and is directed to the second controller module 30. The digester cook operator manually enters total 502 and free 502 acid strength chemical tests as inputs to the controller module 30 over units 32 and 33, respectively. The controller automatically subtracts the difference, which become the combined 502 content, in a comparator unit 34. The delignification rate can then have acid strength S02 correction applied over a function generator 35 and multipliers 36, 37. The delignification rate will be integrated for each cook, in a unit 38, with respect to time, for totalising the area under the reaction curve ofFigure 3. This area totalisation is related to a degree of cooking KappaNumber set point for the particular grade. When the cook has been brought up to the desired set point, an alarm will sound for the digester cook operators final decision on when to terminate the cook.
