# Improved needle dial for a single cylinder circular hosiery knitting machine for producing ribbed knitting.

## Abstract
For a single cylinder circular hosiery knitting machine for producing ribbed knitting, there is proposed a needle dial 10, 12 provided with radial grooves 14 each de signed to receive a needle 17 provided with a flexible ele ment 18 forming a distal arch. The grooves 14 open free ly at the dial periphery and starting from this peripheral opening they comprise a widened portion 22 for freely re ceiving the distal arch of the flexible element of the relative needle. Advantageously, the widening of the initial portion of each groove is non symmetrical about its central axial plane.
