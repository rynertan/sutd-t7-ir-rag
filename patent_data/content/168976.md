# Process for the production of aminophenols.

## Abstract
A divalent phenol is reacted with ammonia without a catalyst or using a water soluble catalyst, and a product con taining an aminophenol and unreacted divalent phenol sepa rated and recovered. The product is then contacted with an aliphatic ether substantially incompatible with said amino phenol in an inert gas atmosphere at its melting point or a higher temperature, and the resultant mixture then cooled to induce crystallization of the aminophenol, and thereafter filtered to ob tain a cake mainly composed of said aminophenol. The cake is melted and contacted with an aliphatic ether in an inert gas atmosphere in the co presence of water and a surfactant, and the resultant mixture cooled to crystallize the aminophenol, which is finally recovered.
