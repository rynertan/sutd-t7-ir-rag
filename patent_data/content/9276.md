## Description
PROPYLENE POLYMER COMPOSITION WITH TALC The invention relates to a polymer composition with a high filler content on the basis of a crystalline propylene polymer and talc that is suitable for the manufacture of moulded articles. Polymer compositions on the basis of a crystalline propylene polymer with a high filler content in order to reach a high heat distortion temperature and to keep the combustion heat of the composition low, are already since a long time aimed at. One aims at a high degree of impact strength at sufficient rigidity. This desired combination of properties can be attained at low filler contents below 30 weight , Netherlands Terinzagelegging 7708702 but at higher filler contents this is very difficult to achieve. An attempt to reach this goal is described in British Patent Specification 1,362,912 and Netherlands Terinzagelegging 7604935. The propylene polymer used is, for instance, a propylene ethylene block copolymer with an ethylene content of up to 30 by weight. A filler that is mentioned is talc, for instance.However, the impact strength of such a composition at a sufficient rigidity is at a low level that is far from satisfactory. For the manufacture of a film resembling paper and intended for use as a base layer for light sensitive layers, literature mentions compositions consisting of a block copolymeric so called propylene ethylene polyallomer with 15 25 by weight of talc, 5 15 by weight of titanium dioxide and 5 13 by weight of rubbery ethylene propylene copolymer. The mixture may furthermore contain propylene homopolymer and or a small amount, e.g. 9 by weight, of linear polyethylene. British Patent Specification 1,440,659 andFrench Patent Specification 2,114,725 . The mixing ratios of talc to titanium dioxide is essential in these compositions. Because of their mechanical properties, these compositions are less suitable for the manufacture of moulded articles.The required high content of titanium dioxide is a distinct drawback for the last mentioned purpose which is a special object of the invention. The invention provides a polymer composition with a high filler content that has both a high rigidity and a high degree of impact strength. The polymer composition according to the invention contains 30 685 by weight of a propylene ethylene block copolymer with 2 30 by weight oi ethylene units, 30 605 by weight of talc and 2 20 by weight oi a rubbery ethylene propylene copolymer, all percentages being calculated to the total composition. The propylene ethylene block copolymer may have been prepared in any known way. Use may, for instance, be made of a multi step process, in which propylene is polymerized in a first step, optionally in the presence of a minor amount of ethylene, and either ethylene by itself or a mixture of propylene and ethylene are polymerized together in a second step in the presence of the polymer formed in the first step. A third step similar to the first may follow, it so desired, etc. If so desired, unconverted monomer may be expelled in between the steps, e.g. by evaporation with or without an inert gas, e.g. nitrogen, being passed through. Another sequence of the steps may also be used, or use may be made of more than two steps with difierent propylene ethylene ratios. The ethylene content of the product oi the propylenepolymerization step, the crystalline polypropylene blocks, is preferably 0 3 by weight. The polypropylene blocks may contain a minor amount, e.g. up to 5 by weight, of another l alkene with at most 8 carbon atoms per molecule, e.g. 1 butene or 1 hexene. The ethylene content oi the total propylene ethylene block copolymer is preferably S 15 by weight. Preference is given to block copolymers that contain rubbery propylene ethylene copolymer blocks in addition to crystalline polypropylene blocks. The melt index of the block copolymer, measured according to AsTM D 1238 230 C 10 kg, is preferably 0.8 20 g min. The polymerization for preparing the block copolymer can be effected in the gaseous phase, in the mass, or in a liquid vehicle, e.g. a hydrocarbon with 4 12 carbon atoms per molecule. The catalyst may he any well known Ziegler catalyst, particularly a combination of a titanium halogenide and an organic aluminium compound, e.g. the combination titanium trichloride diethyl aluminium chloride or triethyl aluminium, if so desired with any of the well known catalyst additives, e.g. a Lewis base. Propylene homopolymer may, or may not, be added to the polymer product obtained in the polymerization in order to obtain the desired propylene ethylene block copolymer to be used in the composition. Also the rubbery ethylene propylene copolymer can be prepared ina known way by means of a Ziegler catalyst, particularly a catalyst based on a vanadium compound. The copolymer preferably contains 68 82 moles of ethylene units. Furthermore, it preferably contains 0.1 3 moles of units of a diene monomer, e.g. hexadiene, dicyclopentadiene or ethylidene norbornene. The rubbery copolocner may furthermore contain a minor amount, e.g. up to 10 moles 70, of another l alkene with 2 8 carbon atoms per molecule. The Mooney viscosity is preferably at least 20, measured according to ISOR 289 with a cold rotor. The optimum content of rubbery ethylene propylene copolymer in the composition decreases with increasing talc content. By preference, the sum of the percentages by weight of rubbery copolymer and talc amounts to 45 62. The content of rubbery ethylene propylene copolymer amounts to 5 15 by weight, by preference. The talc content of the composition is preferably 35 55 , and most preferably 40 505 by weight. The talc may have been pretreated with adhesion improving agents and the like in a known way. Preferably a tale is used with a mean particle size of 1 100 t m, by preference 2 50 d fl, particularly 5 25 LI m. The composition according to the invention may furthermore contain polyethylene, particularly polyethylene with a density of at least 0.94 g cm3 and a melt index ASTM D 1238 190 C 2.16 kg of at most 30, preferably 0.5 10, dg min. Thus a better flow behaviour of the composition can be achieved. The polyethylene may be present in an amount of, e.g. 1 10 by weight calculated to the total composition, particularly 2 5 by weight. The polyethylene may contain a minor amount of, e.g., at most 10 moles of one or more other l alkenes with 3 8 carbon atoms per molecule, especially l butene.If polyethylene is present, the amount of rubbery copolymer may be reduced within the limits specified. Here, too, the sum of the weight percentages of rubbery copolymer, talc and poly ethylene preferably amounts to 45 62. The polyethylene may have been prepared in a known way, e.g. by means of a Ziegler catalyst. The composition may contain, in addition to the abovementioned components, the usual amounts of the usual additives, such as stabilizers, pigments, antistatic agents, loosening agents, neutralizing agents, expanding agents, and the like. Titanium dioxide as a pigment may than be present in a concentration of below 5 by weight, preferably in a concentration of 1 3 by weight. The composition according to the invention can be prepared in a simple way by mixing the components, e.g. by means of a roller, a Banbury mixer or an extruder. In order to manufacture moulded articles, the minimum demand made on the E modulus in practice is usually 2200 N mm2 and, preferably, 2500 N mm2. The compositions according to the invention readily meet this demand, while they are moreover very impactresitant, which finds exprassion in a very high Izod value. The melt index 230 C 10 kg of the composition may range, for instance, between 0.5 and 6 g min, in dependence on the intended use. At a melt index of 0.8 to 1.4 g min, the composition according to the invention is particularly suitable to be processed into pallets by injection moulding or expanding injection moulding methods. The composition according to the invention, however, is also suitable for a great many other uses. The invention will be further elucidated with reference to the next non restricting examples and comparative experiments.Comparative lxperiments A D A propylene ethylene block copolymer with 10 by weight of ethylene units and a melt index 230 OC 10 kg of 2.9 g min was mixed with an amount of talc Luzenac OOS particle size 50 10 m on a tworoller mill with a roller temperature of 190 C. The rolled sheet was removed from the roller after 5 minutes. The rolled sheets were processed into pressed plates of 3.2 mm thickness. Specimens were sawn from these plates and then tested for the elasticity modulus according to AsTh D 790 by means of a three point bending test and for the Izod notch impact strength according to ISO R 180 at 23 C and 30 C .The fragments of the rolled sheets were furthermore used to determine the melt index according to ASTM D 1238 at 230 OC with a lO kg weight. The make up of the compositions and the corresponding properties are compiled in Table I. . The results clearly show that the addition of only talc raises the elasticity modulus, which is accompanied, however, by a strong decrease of the notch impact strength.Examples I VII The method described under the Comparative Experiments A D was used to prepare and test compositions to which a rubbery ethylene propylene copolymer with 67.5 by weight about 74.5 moles 70 of ethylene units and 6ss by weight about 1.7 moles of ethylidenenorbornene units with a Mooney viscosity of 70 had been added besides the talc and the propylene ethylene block copolymer. The make up and properties of these compositions are also given inTable I, The results show that the impact strength of compositions of propylene ethylene block copolymers and talc can be considerably improved by addition of the rubbery ethylene propylene copolymer, while sufficient rigidity is retained.Comparison of Example II andComparative experiment B shows, for instance, that much higher notch impact strengths can be attained at about the same elasticity modulus, while the higher talc content is tolerable.Examples VItI X The method described under the Examples I VII was used to prepare and test compositions which a polyethylene with a density of 0.948 g cm2 and a melt index of 3 dg min 190 C 2.16 kg was added besides the talc, the propylene ethylene block copolymer and the rubbery ethylene propylene copolymer. In these examples the amount by weight of polyethylene was kept equal to the amount by weight of rubbery ethylene propylene copolymer. The make up and the properties of the resulting compositions are also shown inTable I. PE here denotes polyethylene. Compared with those of Examples IV VI, the results of these examples show that a better flow behaviour can be obtained by combination of the rubbery ethylene propylene copolymer with highdensity polyethylene, while the favourable mechanical properties of the compositions are retained.Examples XI XIII The method described under the Examples I VII was used to prepare and test compositions, wherein however as talc the finer talc type Norwegian Talc AT Extra particle size 37 2 Um was used.The make up and the properties of the resulting compositions are also shown in Table I. Compared to those, of Examples IV VI, the results of these examples show that the compositions with the finer talc type show a considerably lower melt index. The stiffness and the impact strength are apparently not much influenced by the type of talc used, so that also these compositions show favourable mechanical properties. Table IExp.
