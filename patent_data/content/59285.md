# Method of making flexible separators for alkaline batteries.

## Abstract
A flexible, porous battery separator comprising a coat ing applied to a porous, flexible substrate. The coating comprises a a thermoplastic rubber based resin which is insoluble and unreactive in the alkaline electrolyte, b a polar organic plasticizer which is reactive with the alkaline electrolyte to produce a reaction product which contains a hydroxyl group and or a carboxylic acid group, and c a mixture of polar particulate filler materials which are unreactive with the electrolyte, the mixture comprising at least one first filler material having a surface area of greater than 25 meters² gram, and at least one second filler material having a surface area of 10 to 25 meters² gram, wherein the volume of the mixture of filler materials is less than 45 of the total volume of the fillers and the binder, the filler surface area per gram of binder is about 20 to 60 meters² gram, and the amount of plasticizer is sufficient to coat each filler particle.
