# Semiconductor device comprising an interconnection electrode and method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A method for manufacturing a semiconductor device having a high breakdown voltage and a high reliability, comprises a forming on a semiconductor substrate 12 an insulating layer 13 having a diffusion window 14 b forming an impurity doped poly silicon layer 15 on the insulating layer 13 and on that portion of the semiconductor substrate 2 which is exposed through the diffusion window 14 c forming an undoped poly silicon layer 16 on the impurity doped poly silicon layer 15 d thermally oxidizing the substrate 2 with the insulating layer 13 , impurity doped poly silicon layer 15 and undoped poly silicon layer 16 , thus diffusing the impurity from the impurity doped poly silicon layer 15 into the semiconductor substrate 12 through the diffusion window 14 and converting the undoped poly silicon layer 16 to a silicon oxide layer 18 e forming on the silicon oxide layer 18 an oxidation resisting mask layer 19 in a desired pattern and f thermally oxidizing the substrate 12 with the insulating layer 13 , impurity doped poly silicon layer 15 , silicon oxide layer 18 and mask layer 19 , thus converting those portions of the impurity doped poly silicon layer 15 which lie beneath those portions of the silicon oxide 18 layer which are exposed through the mask layer 19 to impurity doped silicon oxide layers, whereby the remaining portions of the impurity doped poly silicon layer provide an interconnection electrode layer 21 having a desired pattern.
