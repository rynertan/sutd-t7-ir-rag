# Intrusion detector.

## Abstract
An intrusion detector system with a transmitter Figure 1 having a transmitter clock 22, 24, 26 operating at a selected frequency, with the frequency being one of a selected number of frequencies, a pseudorandom code sequence generator 28 for generating one of a selected number of codes, a modulator 42, 20 for spread spectrum modulating an electromagnetic signal with the generated pseudorandom code sequence signal, and a transmitter antenna 36 for transmitting the modulated signal through a zone of protection and a receiver Figure 2 having a receiving antenna 38 a demodulator for detecting and demodulating the modulated signal to recover the transmit ter pseudorandom code sequence signal, a receiver clock 64, 66, 68 operating at a frequency corresponding to the transmitter clock, with the frequency being one of a selected number of frequencies, a pseudorandom code sequence generator 70 for generating one of a selected number of receiver pseudorandom code signals corresponding to the transmitter pseudorandom code sequence signals, a detec tor 58 for comparing the received transmitter code sequ ence signal to the receiver code signal and generating a detection signal proportional to the signal amplitude of the received code signal when locked in phase with the receiver code signal, a phase detector 60 for detecting the phase difference between the two code signals, a control for phase synchronizing the two code signals, and a monitor 80 for detecting changes in the detection signal resulting from entry of movement of an intruder in the zone of protection and for generating a signal in response thereto.
