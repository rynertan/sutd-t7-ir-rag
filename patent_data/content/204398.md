# Air guard diffuser in a floor polishing machine.

## Abstract
An apparatus for diffusing air turbulence created during the normal operation of a rotary pad floor polishing machine. This device includes an air permeable member 12 which surrounds the circumference of the pad shroud 11 , thereby physically preventing the escape of particulate matter from beneath the floor polishing machine and disrupting turbulent air flow. A mounting ring 13 is included for pressure fitting the permeable element to the pad shroud.
