# Epicyclic transmission utilizing sets of races having differential clearances.

## Abstract
An epicyclic speed reducng transmission including first and second sets of conjugate races 12 15 and first and second sets of rollers 20, 21 disposed between races of the first and second sets utilizes rollers and races which are sized such that a first radial clearance between the rollers 20 and the races 12, 13 which include a stator race 13 exceeds the radial clearance between the second set of rollers 21 and races 14, 15 which includes an output race 15 so that the radial load handled by the first and second sets of rollers is equalized when the rollers are loaded by an eccentric cam 4 utilized for orbiting one of the races of each set of conjugate races.
