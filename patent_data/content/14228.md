## Abstract
There is provided a solid fuel which comprises a liquid fuel and cyclodextrin or a cyclodextrin containing decomposition product of starch, as well as a thermoformed solid fuel which comprises a liquid fuel, cyclodextrin or a cyclodextrin containing decomposition product of starch, a combustible substance and a base. In addition, there is provided a process for producing a solid fuel, which process comprises mixing a liquid fuel with cyclodextrin or a cyclodextrin containing decomposition product of starch to form an inclusion compound of the liquid fuel and cyclodextrin, with the optional additional steps of admixing therewith a combustible substance and a base and thermoforming the admixture, as well as the products of such processes.
