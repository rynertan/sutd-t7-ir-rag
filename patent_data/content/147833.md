# METHOD AND APPARATUS TO SEAL COATED PAPERBOARD MATERIALS

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for forming a seam on a thermoplastic coated container, which container has been formed from a single blank 6 or a continuous by bending a substrate member 4 from which container was formed and overlapping edges 22, 24 thereof to form the seam. According to the practice of this invention, the edges 22, 24 of the substrate member 4 which are to be overlapped and joined to form the seam are each heated, prior to their overlapping, by energy from a laser 16 to thereby render the thermoplastic coatings on the overlapped portions of the substrate member soft and tacky so that they will adhere to each other when pressed together and allowed to cool. The laser energy is applied by directing an unfocused laser beam of 10.6 Âµm wavelength over a zone of about 1,26399 cm one half inch in width to each other to the two edges 22, 24 , the web or blanks 6 being fed along a conveyor 12 past the stationary laser sources 16 .
