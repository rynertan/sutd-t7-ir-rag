# A METHOD OF SEPARATING LIGHT ENDS FROM A MIXED HYDROCARBON FEED, AND APPARATUS FOR CARRYING OUT THE METHOD

## Abstract
Fouling during separation of light ends from a mixed hydrocarbon feed in a fractionating tower, particularly in the depropanizer in ethylene separation from steam cracked naphtha, is reduced by fractionating the vapour portion of the feed in a first tower 21 before fractionating the liquid portion of the feed together with the bottoms from the first tower in a second tower 24 operating at a lower pressure than the first. The bottoms temperature of second fractiona tion is thereby reduced which reduces fouling. Energy consumption is reduced by decreased refrigeration and heating requirements.
