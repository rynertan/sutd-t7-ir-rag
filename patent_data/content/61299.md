# TRENCH DIGGER

## Abstract
A small capacity trench digger for one man operation in which a motor drives a toothed, endless, trench digging chain through a transmission which allows slip if the teeth strike hard material. The chain bar which supports the chain rises and falls in response to lever adjustment which gives a choice of cutting depths as the digger is wheeled over the ground. A tooth pattern is also disclosed which increases the area of contact with the link plates of the chain when the tooth tilts in the act of digging.
