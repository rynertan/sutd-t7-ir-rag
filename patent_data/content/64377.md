# Apparatus for the slide forming of prestressed concrete.

## Abstract
A combination long lower mold and pretension bench 1 for the formation of prestressed concrete materials is constructed by serially connecting plurality of unit lower molds 1a of concrete, attaching prestressing steel wire tension benches 3, 4 one each to the foremost and rearmost unit lower molds, and fastening the unit lower molds 1a and the tension benches 3, 4 collectively with steel wires 5 . Prestressed concrete materials are obtained by stretch ing prestressing steel wires 9 along the upper surface of the long lower mold 1a , continuously pouring and placing stiff consistency concrete C on the long lower mold, causing a slide upper mold 8 to run on the concrete thereby shaping the concrete in a required cross section, curing the shaped concrete strip, and cutting the cured concrete strip into pieces of a desired size.
