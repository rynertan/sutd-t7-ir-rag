# Composite release sheet material.

## Abstract
A composite release sheet material comprises a thermo plastic low adhesive layer e.g. of polyolefin resin, having a thickness of at least 5 µm, preferably 8 100 µm, and a synthetic resin having a greater tensile strength than the layer and, if desired, an anchor coat layer therebetween. A release layer can be formed on the thermoplastic layer or on both sides of the material.
