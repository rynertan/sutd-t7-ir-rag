# Diamond circular saw.

## Abstract
A proposed diamond cutter is provided with man made diamond grains on the circumference of a disc base plate 11 , and is formed with slits 15 from the outer circumfer ence to the central part thereof. The slit 15 is angled about 30 with respect to a radial direction of said plate 11 , so that the heat caused during cutting is prevented from running toward the central part, thereby to save the base plate 11 from crackings. Minor cutting edges 18 are provided in addition to angled cutting edges 17 , to increase the cutting effect.
