# Ski binding.

## Abstract
A ski binding which has a bearing member 5 and confinement means 14 movable relative to the bearing member 5 to releasably confine a ski boot 2 in use. Means 21, 25, 28 are provided which are associated with the confinement means 14 to maintain the confinement means 14 in or to release the confinement means 14 from the position wherein they hold the ski boot 2 on the bearing member 5 . The bearing member 5 is elastically attached to a ski 1 to allow relative elastic movement between the bearing member 5 and the ski 1 . Activating means 35, 47 are provided to act upon the means 21, 25, 28 associated with the confinement means 14 which release the confine ment means 14 when a predetermined relative movement of the bearing member 5 relative to the ski 1 has occurred. The predetermined movement in order to effect release must be lateral twisting or upward elastic movement or a com bination of both. The activating means include release member 35 which moves relative to the bearing member 5 along substantially one line whether the bearing member 5 undergoes lateral twisting upward or upward twisting movements. The invention also comprehends means to stress a ski which comprises levers 85 mounted on the ski boot 1 and a tensioning construction 6, 92, 119 between the levers 85 and the ski 1 so that forward movement of the levers 85 causes the tensioning means 6, 92, 119 to stress the ski 1 .
