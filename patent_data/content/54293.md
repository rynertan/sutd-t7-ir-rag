# Switch assembly.

## Abstract
A switch assembly comprises a push button switch and a switch operating mechanism including an actuator and a plunger for transmitting the movement of the actuator to the push button to operate the push button switch. While one end of the plunger is operatively associated with the actuator, the other end of the plunger is rotatably and removably, but axially non movably, coupled to the free end of the push button. For this purpose, the other end of the plunger is formed with a radially outwardly extending anchor flange while the free end of the plunger is formed with a generally U shaped anchor recess for receiving the anchor flange therein.
