# Method and apparatus for blending solids or the like.

## Abstract
Particulate materials are blended in a vessel 10 pro vided with a plurality of vertically extending conduits 24,26,28,30,32,34 therein. The vessel 10 comprises a downwardly converging frustoconically shaped bottom wall 16 which defines the lower region of the vessel. The lower ends of the conduits extend through corresponding open ings in the bottom wall 16 and are connected by suitable conduit means 40 with a solid outlet 20 at the open bottom of the bottom wall 16 , an outlet conduit 42 extending downwardly therefrom with a solids flow control valve 44 interposed therein. A recycle conduit 66 extends from the interior of the outlet conduit 42 at a position above the solids flow control valve 44 therein upwardly to a solids hopper 50 positioned above the vessel 40 . A blower 60 is connected to the upper portion of the hopper 50 and applies vacuum thereto and to the recycle conduit 66 for withdrawing particulate materials or solids through the recycle conduit 66 into the hopper 50 . A hopper conduit 56 extends from the bottom of the hopper 50 to the interior of the upper portion of the vessel 10 and is provided with a flow control valve 58 interposed therein. A sample valve mechanism is interposed in the recycle conduit 66 for withdrawing samples of the solids from within the recycle conduit. Recycle vents 82 communicate between the in terior of the recycle conduit 66 and atmosphere via excess flow valves 84 to provide means for facilitating the fluidizing of solids within the recycle conduit 66 in response to the vacuum applied thereto by the blower 60 . Methods of blending solids using the described apparatus are also disclosed.
