## Abstract
A data storage element 10 included selectively prog rammable rows of data locations each including a predeter mined detectable pattern of indicia. The rows are formed by slots 11, 13, 15 in which slide blocks 40, 40 to leave in each row an open space 41 defining data indicia. The blocks of one row have timing slots 46 therein. When scanned by an optical detector 50 the data storage element provides signals 70 80 which are stored and analyzed to verify that a data storage element has been read and datareading accura cy checks performed to assure the correct reading of data information programmed on the data storage element.
