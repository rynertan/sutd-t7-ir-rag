# A tape player.

## Abstract
A tape player capable of detecting the end of the tape reliably with a simple mechanism which is small in size and weight. The tape player includes a first driving body which has a cam part and an engaging part and which rotates continuously regardless of operating mode of the player a second body for high speed operating mode and a third body for normal speed operating mode, which are mounted together on the same spindle so they can rotate in a given direction together with the first driving body a first rotation al drive transmission mechanism which, when operating in the high speed mode, transmits the rotational drive of the second body for high speed to the spindle of the reel which constitutes the take up side during high speed running of the tape a second rotational drive transmission mechanism which, when operating in the normal speed mode, transmits the rotational drive of the third body for normal speed to the spindle of the reel which constitutes the take up side during normal speed running of the tape. Also a bias force member, which is mounted on the same spindle as the second and third bodies for high speed and for normal speed, receives energizing force as it engages the two bodies and a detection member, which is energized in one direction by the bias force member, changes its position as it follows the cam part of the first driving body for driving, and engages, when the running of the tape is stopped, with the engaging part of the first driving body.
