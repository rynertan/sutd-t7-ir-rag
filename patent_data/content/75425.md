# Fuel cell system.

## Abstract
A fuel cell system with means to cool and recirculate air to the cathode of a fuel cell stack. Heat energy is removed from the stack 10 through utilization of excess air relative to the stoichiometric amount for reaction with a hydrogen containing fuel. Reaction products flow to a nozzle 36 upstream of a flow constricting venturi 34 . A coolant in a fine spray form, is in jected through the venturi 34 and draws the reaction pro ducts through the venturi. The mixing of the coolant and the reaction products results in a condensation of the high tem perature reaction product water vapor and further dehumidifi cation of the reaction products takes place in a passive separ ator 44 . Coolant is injected into the venturi in sufficient quantity to develop the pressure head necessary to recirculate the cooled and dehumidified air through a conduit system and back to the fuel cell stack. Coolant and water collected in the passive separator 44 can also be recirculated for injection through the venturi.
