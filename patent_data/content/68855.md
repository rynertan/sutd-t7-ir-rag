# Cleaning electrodes.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for the removal of at least a por tion of a removable layer 20 of adhering impurity substances from at least one surface of an electrode 14 used in the electro lytic deposition of metals, which method comprises contacting the electrode surface with at least one cleaning means consist ing of a rotating member 12 which has attached thereto a plu rality of radially projecting flexible fingers 18 and wherein the axis of rotation of the member is substantially parallel to the surface of the electrode. The rotating member may be a cylin drical member having fingers attached thereto, or may be a shaft having a number of arms radially attached, the arms hav ing attached thereto the fingers which contact the electrode. The method and apparatus of this invention afford better con trol of the amount of material removed, and minimise electrode surface damage.
