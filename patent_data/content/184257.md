Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula I may be obtained by the application of art known procedures.Diastereoisomers may be separated by physical separation methods such as selective crystallization and chromatographic techniques, e.g., counter current distribution, and enantiomers may be separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with optically active acids. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. It is evident that the cis and trans diastereomeric racemates may be further resolved into their optical isomers, cis , cis , trans and trans by the application of methodologies known to those skilled in the art. Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula I are naturally intended to be embraced within the scope of the invention. The compounds of formula I , their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and stereochemically isomeric forms possess useful pharmacological properties. Por example. they show useful anti hypoxic and anti anoxic properties, which activity is clearly evidenced by the experimental data obtained in e.g. the KCN Test in Rats . In view of their anti anoxic or anti hypoxic activity, the compounds of formula I , their acid addition salts and or their possible stereoisomers are very useful in the treatment of warmrblooded animals suffering from anoxia or hypoxia, for example, in such situations where the oxygen supply is reduced or blocked. such as shock, cardiac arrest, severe blood losses and the like situations. In view of their anti anoxic and anti hypoxic activity the subject compounds may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for adainistration purposes. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, in base or acid addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably.for administration orally, rectally or by parenteral injection. Por example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form. any oe the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forn. in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed.For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Acid addition salts of I due to their increased water solubility over the corresponding base form, are obviously more suitable in the preparation of aqueous compositions. It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic eEEect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets including scored or coated tablets , capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like. and segregated multiples thereof. The present invention is also related with a method of treating hypoxia or anoxia in warm blooded animals suffering from said hypoxia or anoxia by administering an effective anti anoxic or hypoxic amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. Although the amounts to be administered to subjects may vary within rather large limits, daily doses varying of from 0.1 tg kg body weight to 40 ug kg body weight are preferred. The following examples are intended to illustrate and not to limit the scope of the present invention. Unless otherwise stated all parts therein are by weight. eXPERIMENTL PARTA.

Pharmacological Examples The useful anti anoxic properties of the compounds of formula I can be demonstrated in the following test procedures.example 46 KCN Test in Rats. Histotoxic anoxia is produced by a rapid intravenous injection of potassium cyanide KCN in rats. KCN in control rats induces abdominal contractions and clonic seizures and is lethal within 2 minutes. The protection from KCN induced lethality appears to be a simple way of evaluating quantitatively the anti anoxic properties of the test compounds. Male Vista rats weighing 200 g were treated subcutaneously with a test compound. One hour after treatment there was injected intravenously a KCN solution at a dose of 5 mg kg body weight. Survival after 2 minutes was evaluated and 8D50 values were determinated. The ZD50 values of the compounds of formula I are listed in table I. Said eD5o values are those values in mg kg body weight capable of protecting 508 of the tested animals against KCN induced lethality.
