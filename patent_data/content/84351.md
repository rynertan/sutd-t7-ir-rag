## Description
The present invention relates to a keyless electronic door locking unlocking system for an automotive vehicle for locking vehicle doors by a locking command signal and for unlocking them by an unlocking command signal. As is well known, there exists an electronic push button type door locking unlocking system for an automotive vehicle, by which vehicle doors can be locked or unlocked when the driver depresses a plurality of push button type switches in accordance with a predetermined code, said switches being installed at an appropriate position at the outside of the vehicle. An electronic push button type door unlocking system for an automotive vehicle is described in EP A 2 948. A push button type keyboard is installed e.g. at the driver s door. Several different codes may be inputted by the push buttons for effecting a number of functions from outside the vehicle, e.g. for unlocking the doors or to lower selected side windows. Permanent preprogrammed codes for the different functions are stored, and the inputted codes are compared with the stored codes to decide which function should be activated. The publication does not describe how the doors are locked. A vehicle securing and lock out prevention system is described in WO A 80 01477. The system uses a card reader or an encoding device, preferably mounted near the driver s door for inputting a predetermined locking code or a predetermined unlocking code. A locking command signal is generated always when the ignition key has been removed and at least one vehicle door has been opened and closed in sequence. It is an object of the present invention to provide a keyless electronic door locking unlocking system for an automotive vehicle providing new security measures. The electronic door locking unlocking system for an automotive vehicle for locking unlocking vehicle doors, according to the present invention comprises An electronic door locking unlocking system for an automotive vehicle for locking unlocking vehicle doors, said system comprising In previously known keyless electronic door locking systems, a signal disabling the lock command signal was only provided when the ignition key or a coded card serving as ignition key had not been removed before trying to lock the car. It is a new measure of security in electronic door locking unlocking systems to check whether the vehicle is secured against rolling away. The features and advantages of the electronic door locking system for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention will be more clearly appreciated from the following description of the preferred embodiment of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing in which The figure is a schematic block diagram of an embodiment of the electronic door locking system according to the present invention. First, the circuit configuration of an embodiment of the electronic door locking system according to the present invention will be described hereinbelow with reference to the attached drawing. The system according to the present invention can roughly be divided into four sections a door unlocking command signal generating section In the door unlocking command signal generating section 1, the reference numerals 10a 10e denote a plurality of push button type switches arranged at an appropriate position on the outer surface of a vehicle door. To unlock vehicle doors, a specific sequence of numerals, such as the five digits 2 1 3 5 4 are used while to lock the vehicle doors, a single specific numeral, such as the digit 2 the first of the above five digits is used. The reference numeral 11 denotes an octal binary code converter referred to as O B converter hereinafter for converting the octal code designated by the push button switches 10a 10e into the corresponding three bit binary code. The reference numeral 12 denotes a first OR gate for generating a H voltage level output signal whenever the O B converter 11 outputs a three bit binary coded signal, and the reference numeral 13 denotes an address counter for generating an address designating signal which is advanced incrementally by the H voltage level signals from the OR gate 12. In other words, when a first signal is inputted to the address counter 13 via the first OR gate 12, the counter 13 outputs a three bit binary signal 001 to designate address No. 1 in the memory unit 14 when a second signal is inputted to the address counter 13 via the first OR gate 12, the counter 13 outputs a three bit binary signal 010 to designate address No. 2 in the memory unit, and so on. The reference numeral 14 denotes a memory unit such as a RAM or ROM in which the above mentioned numerical code 2 1 3 5 4 is previously stored in the form of binary coded digits. The respective binary coded digits corresponding to the above mentioned octal code 2 1 3 5 4 are read out sequentially in response to the address designation signals outputted from the address counter 13. The reference numeral 15 denotes a first comparator for comparing the binary coded digits outputted from the O B converter 11 with the ones read out from the memory unit 14 and outputting a H voltage level signal whenever the digits agree, the reference numeral 16 denotes a counter for outputting a signal after the first comparator 15 has inputted the predetermined number of signals five signals in this embodiment consecutively thereto, and the reference numeral 17 denotes a first reset set flip flop referred to as RS FF hereinafter for generating a door unlocking command signal when set by the output signal from the counter 16. Further, the reference numeral 18 denotes an inverter, the reference numeral 19 denotes a first AND gate, the reference numeral 20 denotes a delay circuit, and the reference numeral 21 denotes a second OR gate. These elements serves to reset the counter 16 to a L voltage level a fixed period of time after the predetermined octal unlocking code 2 1 3 5 4 has been inputted to the O B converter 11 by the driver via the push button switches 10a 10e. In more details since the three bit address signals from the address counter 13 are applied to the respective input terminals of the first AND gate 19, when the last digit of the octal unlocking code is inputted, the address counter 13 outputs a three bit binary signal 101 5 in octal code to designate address No. 5 in the memory unit 14. Therefore, since this three bit signal is inputted to the first AND gate 19 via the three independent input terminals, the first AND gate 19 outputs a H voltage level signal, because 0 of the 2nd input terminal is applied to the first AND gate 19 after having been inverted into 1 through the inverter 18. This H voltage level output signal from the first AND gate 19 is inputted to the delay circuit 20, and, after a fixed period has elapsed, the output signal from the delay circuit 20 resets the counter 16 through the second OR gate 21. Furthermore, the reference numeral 22 denotes a retriggerable monostable multivibrator which can be retriggered when a H voltage level signal is inputted thereto within a predetermined period of time but automatically reset to a L voltage level when no H voltage level signal is inputted thereto within a predetermined period of time. The reference numeral 23 denotes a first monostable multivibrator which is automatically reset to a L voltage level after a H voltage level is kept for a predetermined period of time when triggered. These elements serve to reset the counter 16 to a L voltage level when the push button switches are not depressed consecutively, that is, when the switches are depressed intermittently with delays exceeding a predetermined time interval. If the counter 16 is reset before outputting a signal, the first RS FF will not be set and so will not output a door unlocking signal. In more detail, the output signal from the first OR gate 12 is applied to the retriggerable monostable multivibrator 22 and the first monostable multivibrator 23 is so designed as to be triggered by the trailing edge of the output signal from the retriggerable monostable multivibrator 22. Therefore, in the case where the O B converter 11 outputs binary coded signals consecutively to the trigger terminal of the retriggerable monostable multivibrator 22, the multivibrator 22 is repeatedly triggered to a H voltage level without dropping to the L voltage level as long as the binary coded signals are inputted, therefore, the first monostable multivibrator 23 is not triggered into a H voltage level because the first multivibrator 23 can be triggered only when the retriggerable multivibrator 22 changes to a L voltage level , so that the counter 16 is not reset through the second OR gate 21. In the case where the O B converter 11 outputs binary coded signals to the trigger terminal of the retriggerable monostable multivibrator 22 intermittently with delays exceeding a predetermined time interval determined by setting a time constant of the CR circuit in the multivibrator 22 , since the retriggerable monostable multivibrator 22 is automatically reset to a L voltage level before the next binary coded signal from the first OR gate 12 triggers it, the trailing edge of the output signal therefrom triggers the first monostable multivibrator 23, and as a result the counter 16 is reset via the second OR gate 21 to the original condition before it can output a H level signal to the first RS FF 17. Furthermore, after being set, the first RS FF 17 for outputting a door unlocking signal is reset after a predetermined period of time by an output signal from a first timer 24 which starts in response to the H voltage level output signal from the first RS FF 17. In the door locking command signal generating section To lock the vehicle doors, for instance, the first digit 2 of the five consecutive unlocking numerals 2 1 3 5 4 is depressed by the driver via one of the push button switches 10a 10e. When a push button switch corresponding to 2 is depressed, the O B converter 11 outputs the corresponding binary coded signals 010 . When this first signal is inputted to the address counter 13 via the first OR gate 12, the counter 13 outputs a three bit binary signal 001 to designate address No. 1 in the memory unit 14. Therefore, a first stored code signal is read out from the memory unit 14 and this signal is compared with the output signal from the O B converter 11 by the second comparator 25. When the signals agree, the output signal from the comparator 25 triggers the second monostable multivibrator 26. As a result, the second RS FF 27 is set by the output signal from the second monostable multivibrator 26, in order to generate a door locking signal. After being set, the second RS FF 27 for outputting a door locking signal is reset after a predetermined period of time by an output signal from a second timer 28 which starts in response to the H voltage level output signal from the second RS FF 27. In the door lock unlock actuating section The solenoid 29 is used for locking or unlocking the vehicle doors according to the direction of current flowing therethrough. In more detail, in the case where the first RS FF 17 outputs a door unlocking command signal, since current is applied to the base of the first transistor 30, the first transistor 30 is turned on. In addition, since current is also applied to the base of the second transistor 31, the second transistor 31 is turned on so that a solenoid energizing current flows from the positive terminal Vc, through the second transistor 31, the solenoid 29, and the first transistor 30 to ground in the direction of arrow A, so that the solenoid 29 is energized to unlock the vehicle doors. In the case where the second RS FF 27 outputs a door locking command signal, since current is applied to the base of the fourth transistor 33, the fourth transistor 33 is turned on. In addition, since current is also applied to the base of the third transistor 32, the third transistor 32 is turned on so that a solenoid energizing current flows from the positive terminal Vc, through the third transistor 32, the solenoid 29, and the fourth transistor 33 to ground in the direction of arrow B, so that the solenoid 29 is energized to lock the vehicle doors. In the unsafe park sensor section The reference numeral 35 denotes a third monostable multivibrator, the reference numeral 36 denotes a third RS FF, and the reference numeral 37 denotes a fourth monostable multivibrator. These elements configures means for disabling the lock command signal. In the case where the vehicle is not parked safely, the unsafe park sensor 34 outputs a H voltage level signal to trigger the third monostable multivibrator 35, therefore, the third RS FF 36 is set to a H voltage level output. Since the output terminal Q of this third RS FF 36 is connected to the reset terminal R of the second RS FF 27, the RS FF 27 is compulsorily reset by this signal from the third RS FF 36, so that the RS FF 27 cannot output a door locking command signal, even if an appropriate push button switch is depressed to lock the door, when the vehicle is left in an unsafe state. The fourth monostable multivibrator 37 is triggered when the vehicle doors are closed perfectly or when the gear shift lever is securely set to the Park position, that is, when the output signal from the unsafe park sensor 34 returns to a L voltage level, so that the third RS FF 36 is reset to prevent outputting a reset signal to the second RS FF 27, that is, the second RS FF 27 can now output a door locking command signal if the appropriate push button switch is depressed. The reference numeral 39 denotes a second AND gate and the reference numeral 40 denotes an alarm device 40. In the case where a door lock signal is inputted via the push button switch 10 when the unsafe park sensor 34 is outputting a H voltage level signal, since both the signals from the second monostable multivibrator 26 and from the third RS FF 36 are applied to the second AND gate 39, the AND gate 39 outputs a signal, so that the alarm device 40 such as a buzzer or chime is activated to indicate to the driver that the vehicle is still in an unsafe state and therefore the door lock is inoperative. The operation of the electronic door locking system for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention will be described hereinbelow. In order to unlock the vehicle door, first a sequence of predetermined octal digits 2 1 3 5 4 are inputted by the driver via the switches 10a 10e the O B converter outputs a series of three bit binary numbers 010 001 011 101 100 corresponding to the octal ones whenever the O B converter outputs a three bit binary signal, the address counter 13 is advanced incrementally via the first OR gate 12 to output an address designation signal from No. 1 to No. 5, respectively in response to these address designation signals the memory unit 14 outputs the three bit binary codes previously stored in the designated memory addresses these numbers are compared with the ones outputted from the O B converter by the first comparator 15 if the numbers match, the comparator 15 outputs a H level signal after a series of binary unlocking numbers have been successfully compared, the counter 16 outputs a signal to set the first RS FF 17, so that a door unlocking signal is outputted. Therefore, the transistors 30 and 31 are both turned on in response to the unlocking signal, and current passes through the solenoid 29 in the direction of arrow A to unlock the vehicle doors. Further, when the last unlocking number is inputted and therefore the address designation signal No. 5 101 is outputted from the address counter 13, the counter 16 is reset after a predetermined period of time determined by the delay circuit 20. If the unlocking numbers are inputted intermittently with delays exceeding a predetemined time interval, the counter 16 is also reset through the retriggerable monostable multivibrator 22 and the first monostable multivibrator 23. In the case where the door is intended to be locked from outside the vehicle by depressing the appropriate push button switch 10a 10e when the unsafe park sensor 34 is outputting a H voltage level signal, the RS FF 36 is set by a trigger signal from the monostable multivibrator 35. Therefore, the reset terminal R of the second RS FF 27 goes to a H voltage level, that is, to the reset state, compulsorily. As a result, even if the proper push button switch 10a 10e is depressed to lock the door, no locking signal will be outputted, disabling door lock operation. At the same time, the H voltage level output signal of the AND gate 39 actuates the alarm device 40, indicating to the driver that the vehicle is still in an unsafe state and thereby the doors can not be locked. Therefore, the driver will notice that the vehicle is left parked unsafely. If, however, the described condition for safe parking is fulfilled, the sensor 34 outputs a L voltage level signal to reset the RS FF 36. Under these conditions, when one of the push button swtiches 10a 10e is depressed, binary coded signals are applied from the O B convereter 11 to the second comparator 25 a code stored in the memory unit 14 is read out when the address counter 13 designates address No.1 the second comparator 25 outputs a signal when the signals match in order to trigger the second monostable multivibrator 26 a locking signal is outputted when the second RS FF 27 is set. The transistors 32 and 33 are turned on in response to the locking signal, and current passes through the solenoid 29 in the direction of arrow B to lock the vehicle door. In the door locking operation, although the first comparator 15 also outputs a signal to advance the counter 16, since only one of the push button switches 10a 10e has been depressed, the retriggerable multivibrator 22 is reset after a predetermined period of time and the counter 16 is reset, so that the unlocking command signal is not generated. By the way, in a cold weather, there exists the case where it is not preferable to apply brake force to a vehicle when the vehicle is left parked in the open air for a long time, because the brake lining may be frozen to the brake shoes and will not operate. Under consideration of these cases, it may be desirable to provide a switch which can disable the sensor 34 according to the present invention. As described above, in the electronic door locking system for an automotive vehicle according to the present invention by which vehicle doors can be locked or unlocked when the driver depress a plurality of push button type switches installed at an appropriate position on the outside of an automotive vehicle in accordance with a predetermined code, since the door locking operation is automatically disabled when the vehicle is left parked in an unsafe state, for instance, when the parking brake is not applied perfectly, or when the gear shift lever is not securely set to the Park position, the doors will be locked only when the vehicle is left parked in a safety state, thus preventing the vehicle from unexpected accident that is, it being possible to park the vehicle safely.
