# DELIVERY OF FUEL TO WORKING CHAMBERS OF INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES

## Abstract
Liquid fuel from a controlled supply is delivered to a delivery tube 147 under a pressure which is too low to deliver a charge of fuel under static conditions. During an induction stroke however, air entering a cylinder of an engine is drawn through a venturi type constriction 156 and thereby draws air from a duct 154 by passing the engine throttle. This air is drawn through a convergent passage to pass the delivery end of the tube 147 at supersonic velocity to draw therefrom a charge of fuel. The tubes 147 for each inlet passage are in permanent communication with the same metered supply so each cylinder draws its appropriate charge in turn.
