# Reversing door ratchet.

## Abstract
A reversing ratchet drive for driving a bolt or other ele ment 15 to be turned selectively in clockwise and counter clockwise directions about an axis of that element has a hous ing 21 that defines a bore 22 coaxial with the axis of the ele ment and that receives a drive head of the element. The drive head has radial external ratchet teeth 25 that are adapted to be engaged by a double pawl 33 pivotally mounted in the housing. The pawl is adapted for movement between forward drive and reverse drive engagement with the ratchet teeth and has an intermediate disengaged position. The assembly is operated by a lever handle 41 adapted to be grasped by an operator. The handle has an inner end receieved in and retained in the housing for twisting movement about its own axis. The inner end of the lever handle is operatively associated with the pawl and is adapted to move the pawl to its forward drive posi tion when the handle is twisted in one direction and to its re verse drive position when the handle is twisted in the opposite direction. The handle is biased to a neutral position so that the pawl is disengaged unless the handle is positively twisted in one direction or the other.
