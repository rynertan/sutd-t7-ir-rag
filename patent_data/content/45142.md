# Adsorption onto charcoal cloth.

## Abstract
An apparatus for adsorbing at least one dissolved or suspended constituent from an ionically conducting medium which comprises a cell chamber 6 , fluid inlet 7 and outlet pipes 8 leading into and out of the chamber and, positioned consecutively across the cham ber, a charcoal cloth working electrode 9 , a porous plastic, preferably nylon, diaphragm 10 and a graphite or platinum counter electrode 11 . The charcoal cloth working electrode is in intimate electrical contact with a metal wire or gauze and by varying the potential of the wire or gauze with a potentiostat the potential applied to the working electrode can also be varied preferably by increments of about 0.01V. Current is sup plied to the working electrode by the counter electrode. The porous diaphragm allows the passage of ions from the counter to the working electrode but prevents the passage of particles of charcoal cloth from one elec trode to the other. In use an ionically conducting medium containing at least one dissolved or suspended constituent is brought into contact with the charcoal cloth working electrode. By applying an electric potential to the cloth with respect to the medium at least one of the dissolved or sus pended constituents is adsorbed on to the cloth. The charcoal cloth working electrode is between 20 and 60 times more efficient than an equivalent graphite elec trode. The apparatus and method is useful in the recovery of chemicals from industrial effluent and in the sepa ration of chemical mixtures.
