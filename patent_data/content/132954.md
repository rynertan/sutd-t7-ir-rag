Yet another object of the present invention is to provide semiconductor and electro optical devices, optical film cooti.ngs and optical rotators. The present invention provides a process for the production of polyphosphide crystals characterised in that it comprises liquid phase growth of polyphosphide crystals from a polyphosphide melt. More particularly, the present process may comprise A heating a polyphosphide charge to a melt having a temperature substantially within the range of from 650 to 6700C and B slowly cooling the melt to form polyphosphide crystals. optionally further C bringing the melt into contact with a substrate to form crystals on the substrate during the slow cooling step optionally further D removing the melt from the substrate at the termination of the slow cooling step optionally further E terminating the slow cooling step when the melt reaches a temperature substantially in the range of prom 630 to 6400C. The preferred Pblyphosphide is KP15. In one preferred embodiment, the charge is contained in a sealed, preferably evacuated ampule, before heating.When crystals are tbe grown on a substrate, this may be accomplished by tilting the ampule to bring the melt into contact therewith. Preferred substrates include quartz, nickel and 111 V semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide and gallium wphosphide. The melt is preferably cooled slowly, for example at a rate of from 6 to 60CO per hour. It may comprise a metal dopant, such as nickel. For a fuller understanding of the nature and objects of the present invention reference may be made to the accompanying illustrative drawing wherein Figures 1, 2 and 3 are schematic diagrams illustrating how a heated ampule is utilized in carrying out the present invention For purposes of illustration, quartz tubes of lffimm outside diameter and 6nm inside diameter or llmn outstide diameter and 9nm inside diameter are loaded with from 0.5 to 2.0 grams of KP15 material produced by the condensed phase process of the above identified, related applications. The ampules are pumped down to 10 4 Torr 1.33 x 10 2 Pa and sealed under vacuum. Referring to accompanying Figure 1, a sealed quartz ampule 20 contains a charge of condensed phase KP15 22 and substrates 24. The ampule 20 is mounted in a furnace, tilted as shown and heated to 65500 in order to melt theKP15 charge 22. The ampule is then tilted as shown in accompanying Figure 2 so that the melt 22 is in contact with the substrates 24. This may be accomplished by tilting the entire furnace including the ampule. The ampule 20 is then allowed to cool slowly at a rate of from 6 to 60CO per hour to 6400C and then the ampule 20 is tilted to its original position as shown in accompanyingFigure 3 and rapidly cooled to room temperature. Polycrystalline films 26 form on the substrates 24 during the slow cooling. Polished wafers of gallium arsenide cleaved along the 110 foce and gallium phosphide cleaved along the 111 face, silicon cleaved along the 110 face, a 2000 angstroms 2 x 10 7 m evaporated nickel layer on quartz, quartz and nickel foil have been utilized as substrates. In all cases, massive crystallization of KP15 whiskers and platelets directly from the melt has been observed. PolycrystallWine KP15 films were grown on all ofthesubstrates. Crystolline KP15 platelets 3 x 3mm in size have been obtained by cleaving grown film from gallium phosphide substrates. Two dimensional growth of KP15 film on theP face of gallium phosphide is observed. The surface morphology of the grown layer suggests topotaxial growth and provides the basis for the application of KP15, thin films as the insulating layer for gallium arsenide, gallium phosphide and indium phosphide MIS devices. By incorporating nickel foil or nickel powder from 1 to 5 , by weight, in the melt and raising the melt to a temperature of 6700C and then slowly cooling to 6300C while in contact with substrates in situ doping of KP15 with nickel has been produced. Other alkali metal polyphosphides of the formula MP15 , wherein M represents an alkali metal, may also be grown from the liquid melt. It has been found that the ampules should first be heated to from 650 to 6700C in order to melt the charge.When nickel dopant is included in the charge, temperatures in the higher portion of the range are preferred. The slow cooling when the melt is in contact with the substrates may as previously stated vary from 6 to 60CO per hour. The final cooling temperature while the melt is still in contact with the substrates may vary from 640 to 64506. In all cases, large quantities of polycrystalline whiskers and platelets are formed directly from the melt, as well as on the substrates. Thus, the process is a convenient technique to produce large quantities of high quality KP15 polycrystalline bulk material in a relatively short time a few hours for use in other processes. Ther term III V semiconductors as used herein means those semiconductors comnonly called intermetallic or compound, formed of compbunds of elements from Group lii and Group V of the Periodic Table, such as aluminium phosphide, aluminium arsenide, aluminium antimonide, gallium phosphide, gallium arsenide, gallium antimonide, indium phosphide, indium arsenide and indium antimonide.
