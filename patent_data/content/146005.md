# Surface defect inspecting apparatus.

## Abstract
The holding mechanism 112 holds an object under inspection in a manner that the substantially entire surface of the object 108 may relatively be scanned by a laser beam. A spherical integrating light collector 127 has an opening 127a disposed close to the inspected surface of the object 108 held by the holding mechanism 112 . A laser beam illuminating mechanism 128 is coupled with the other end of the spherical integrating light collector 127 , and illuminates the inspected surface of the object 108 with the laser beam through the opening 127a . A photo electric converter 129 receives the scattered light as is reflected by the inspected surface and collected by the spherical integrating light collector 127 , and converts the scattered light into an electrical signal representing an amount of light. An analog to digital converter 132 converts the electrical signal derived from the photo electric convert er 129 into a digital signal. A peak detector 133 receives the digital signal derived from the analog to digital convert er 132 to detect peak values at predetermined periods. A mean value calculator 134 calculates a mean value using a digital signal output from the analog to digital converter 132 . A reference value storing memory 141 stores a reference value to determine defects present on the inspect ed surface of the object 108 . A threshold level calculator 140 calculates the threshold level using the reference value and the mean value. A defect detector 137 compares peak values derived from the peak detector 133 with the threshold level, and detects the surface defects on the basis of the result of the comparison.
