## Description
CONTATINER FOR ELEMENTS OF TRACTION BATTERIES This invention concerns a container for elements of traction batteries. In perticuler, his invention concerns F container with several cells for elements of traction batteries having 5. reduced wall thickness. The elements of industrial accumulator batteries and particularly traction ones are usually assembled i n single containers according to discrete series usual ly 6 of heights, basically grouped around two nominal 10. widths of 200 and 160 mm. The whole length series develop with such heights and widths, each container varying from its preceding one in constant or step such traditionally of 18 mm for nominal width of 200 mm and of 16 mm and 19 mm for nominal width of 160 mm.15. It is evident th t there are numerous types of contain ers in existence to meet all needs. For this reason producers have always proceeded to mold single containers, above all because of equipment costs, so as to produce containers of variou measures, even too 20. numerous for rather small productions. This fact compels the producer to make batteries with repeated double walls, the inactive plastic material of which occupies part of the active section of the battery and of the acid. In order to keep within certain limits the interchange ability of containers towards the user, as well as the adaptability towards the producer, thermoplastic mate rials of higher fluidity having better mechanical 5. features have been employed so as to reduce external dimensions, keeping internal dimensions functionally identical with the old productions in hard rubber ebonite , with the sole reduction of the walls of 1 2 m.With the employment of these thermoplastic mP 10. terials of higher flexibility, therefore, batteries with repented double walls have also been made. The purpose of this invention is to eliminate the abovementioned troubles. In particular, the purpose of this invention is to is. provide a container with several cells multiple cell container for elements of traction batteries which are not provided with double walls for each element. According to this invention these and other purposes 20. are achieved by employing multiple containers having thin walls as, for instance, of 2,5 mm instead o f the present walls which are 5 mm thick, and also by providing such walls with P series of ribs. With the employment of multiple containers, according 25. to this invention, in each cell of the multiple the thicknese of one wall is re covered, that is, an average of 3,5 mm to be added to the value obtained from the reduction of the thickness of the walls, that is with a remarkable free space availability for each cell. Since external dimensions have been universally unified, by the IEC in particular, it is preferable, widths ac cepted, to retain as the measure of the multiple length the addition of the length values of the unified contain5. ers.An internal minimum space of 3,25 mm is thus made available as excess of length over the present internal measure. According to this invention, such space availability is used for the ribs, which pursue a double aim 10. P to keep internal measures identical with those of the unified series, for which the known assembly systems can be used, and b to create conditions favourable to the inflow of plastic material during molding, or to create walls of 15. better rigidity according to the vertical axis, even with ground reduction and to have containers which permit e downward flow of acid within the channels between the ribs. The number, width and thickness of these ribs can vary 20. according to the compacting uniformity desired and to the need to obtain P particular elevation of the section modulus. Ribs usually protrude towards the interior of the con tainer with a thicknss not inferior to a quarter of 25. the thickness of the walls, plus nearly a millimeter for the reduction of the thickness of the walls them selves. The number of ribs is preferably such that the section modulus of the sections of the walls in sense of height results higher than that of a wall with a thick30. ness of at least 3,5 mm. The overthickness of the ribs meant for the compacting of the set is preferably of 0,5 mm, uniform to the whole length and the same for the whole series of containers whereas the one meant for the compacting of the positive 5. plates is proportional to the number of plates and pre ferably higher than 0,2 mm for each positive plate. A favourite distance between ribs is of 12 mm and the favourite thickness of each rib is of 3 mm. The walls provided with ribs , according to this inven10. tion, permit more rapid and rational electrolyte circu lation according to the flux lines which, reascending from the centre of the element, descend from above, through the slots formed on the rib walls,to the prisms, flowing parallel to them to re enter between the plates 15. at the centre of the sets. Ribs can be obtained also on walls at variable length with the aim of spacing plates and separators accur te ly, creating an insulation almost without discontinuity. In this case, ribs protrude inwards, have decreasing 20. width,and shift spaces equal to the step of the series, particularly 16 18 19 mm. They are placed in such a way thin their apex comet alongside the frame surround in the negative, while the edges of the two adjoinim separators lean against its slanting edges,thus creating 25. a system of continuous insulation. The invention can be advantageously applied to any multi ple, even if P container with two adjoining cells i s preferred, inasmuch as it represents the greatest common factor of all the combinations of elements in the pre30. sent contPinment tanks. The multiple container object of this invention can be applied to the so cplled continental series,of n nominal width of 200 mm with a step of 18 mm to the English series, of P nominal width of 160 mm and 8 step o f 5. 16 mm and finally to what is normally called American series, of a nominal width of 160 mm and e step of 19mm. The multiple container object of this invention can be closed by thermal welding either with a multiple cover for external connectqrs,that is,welded over the cover 10. itself or for connectors passing across sections or even for terminal connectors over the cover and pass ing through. Naturally, for smell consumers, it can be closed with the old type of inserted sealing cover.15. The multiple container object of this invention, special ly if provided with a fender conveyor, contributes to combat acid stratification and to increase the unifor mity and the constant utilization of the plates, thanks to the slight increase of acid volume but above all to 20. the better circulation with even flow. The multiple container object of this invention, special ly in its higher elements, offers besides the advantage of a higher static stability oqprocessinc lines riven its enlarged basis.25. The walls of this multiple container have a flexible section in the upper part,devoid of ribs, which facili tates the eventual insertion of connectors passing across sections. In order to understand the constructive and functional features of the multiple cell container object of this invention better, it will be described in greater de tail below, making reference to the figures enclosed, which represent some of the preferred embodiments and 5. are to be taken as examples which are by no means restrictive. In the drawings Figure 1 is a plan of the schematic view of a two cell container having wide fixed ribbed walls Figures 2, 3 and 4 represent a schematic view of the 10 sections of the container in Figure 1, the cuting planes showing the lines A A, B B and C C respective ly Figure 5 is a view of the back of the container in Figure 1 15.Figure 6 is the enlarged schematic view of the detail pointed out with a VI in figure 1 Figure 7 is the enlarged schematic vlew of the detail pointed out with 8 VII in figure 4 Fiores 8 and 9 show sectional and plan vews resnec 20. tively of a cover having all it. poles passing over the same Figures 8a and 9a represent respectively the sectional and plan view of another type of cover having a couple of poles passing over th seme 25.Figure 10 gives E plan view of a different embodiment of the two cell container object of this invention, the ribs of which are cut even on four walls at variable length Figures 11, 12, and 13 give a schematic view of the sections of the container in figure 10, the cutting planes showing the lines A A, B B and C C of figure 10 respectively Figure 14 gives a schematic view of the back of the 5. container in figure 10 Figure 15 gives an enlarged schematic view of the de tail pointed out with a XV in figure 10 Figure 16 gives an enlarged schematic view of the de tail pointed out with a XVI in figure 11 10.Figure 17 gives a schematic plan view of a further embodiment of the two cell container object of this invention, the ribs of which are cut on all walls and those on the walls of variable length protrude inwards and recede outwards 15. Figures 18, 19 and 20 give a schematic view of the sec tions of figure 17, the cutting planes showing the lines A A, B B, and C C of figure 17 respectively Figure 21 gives a schematic view of t back of the con trainer in figure 17 20. Figure 22 gives an enlarged schematic view of the detail pointed out with a XXII in figure 17, and Figure 93 gives an enlarged schematic view of the detail pointed out it a XXIII in figure 18. With r ference to type embodiment illustrated in figures 25. 1 7, the two cell container object of this invention comprises two external walls 1 and 2 and the internal ones 3 of standardized width L and thickness s , with ribs 4 of thickness sl and spaced in between by a step p . The thickness s of the walls is of 2,5 mm. The in eternal working length lu of the container coincides with that of single containers minus a compacting fac tor,which will be explained below, whereas the whole ex5. ternal one 1 is equivalent to the addition of the lengths of unified single containers. The total heights and the heights of the prisms are those unified or other wise required by the producer. The ribs 4 have a height limited to the working height of the plates as result 10. of which the upper part of the walls is free from ribs to a height of 80 mm. Besides, such ribs are lowered in the area of the middle wall 3 in which s hole 5 can be opened to let connectors go through. The ribs 4, as shown in fig. 7, present s tapered end 15. hole which permits a soft accompaniment of the set. The thickness sl of the ribs is of at least 2 mm, but it can be enlarged, if desired, to e thickness proportio nal to the number of positive plates of the set, with which a constant compacting factor is ensured. Thus, for 20. instance, there is minimum cotripacting in the case of a container with two positive plates and ribs 2 mm thick whereas in the case of a container with 10 positive plates, the thickness is of 4 mm. The thickness of the ribs is therefore variable according to the number of 25. plates adopted. On the edges of the double container described above, after inserting the sets with their traditional cylin drical poles, the cover 81 illustrated in fig. 9 can be thermally welded, in which process two sumps 82 and 82 are placed on the respective poles. For that purpose, both sumps 82 and 82 have two couples of holes 83 and 83 at the base with clearance as to the pole, which is subseouently obliterated with suitable rubber sealing.5. Locking with elastic seal can be employed in particular. In the case of s partial welding of the container passing across section for the internal connection of both sets, the double container can be coupled to a cover 91, as il lustrated in fig. 9, provided with a single couple of 10. sumps 92 with their holes 93. The poles and sealing means are placed in such holes 93, with the exit of the only terminal poles for the series connection with the two elements of the next container. Figures 10 to 16 show s variant of the double container 15. object of this invention, for which the numerations and indications given for the particular elements of the preceding figures are valid. An essential variant of this embodiment is represented by the ribs 6 which appear against theouter frame of each 20. negative and whose sides adhere to the two separators coupled to the negative. The distance Z between two contiguous ribs is characterized by the step of the typical series, that is, 18 mm for the conti nentel series, 16 for the English an 19 for the American, 25. mhe protrusion s2 of every rib is of 3 mm, for eocil part, for which reason in each cell such protrusion equals the difference between plates and the distance between walls for the continental series the width of the plates is usually of 184 against 191 for the cell, 30. that is, the difference is equal to 7 mm . The bottom thickness s3 of each rib is usually of 4,5 mm, which corresponds to the average thickness of the ordinary negatives of F normal series. The negative, metal cladded between both ribs and both separators, 5 remains well centred and is not reached by lead deposits which tend to originate short circuits during the life of the battery. The covers illustrated in figs. 8 8e, 9 and 9a can also be employed for this type of container. Figures 17 to 23 illustrate third variant of the double container shown in figures 1 to 7, in which the features identified by the same numbers remain un changed. The essential variant of this embodiment is re presented by a series of ribs and slots 7, with which 15. the four wells of variable length are provided. Such ribs and slots can be obtained in relation to the centre lines single positive plates. Ribs and slots 7 have P width Ea of about 8 mm equal to a measure slightly reduced with respect to the usual 20. diameter of the small tubes of the armoured plates, against which it will lean. The s4 protrusion thickness of ribs and slots 7 is of 3 mm and it makes it possible t obtain, t the back of the ribs, deep outer slots of about 3 mm with width G of about 4 mm. 25. Slots are slightly tapering in keeping with separators. With these device the containers of two cells object of this invention make it possible to insulate the positive plates by centring them and to have cooling areas on the outside, specially obtained for high capacity elements that is with numerous plates of great length. With the type of container illustrated in figures 17 2R 5. the covers illustrated in figures 8 8 , 9 and 9a must be modified so as to obtain outer edges in conformity with the profile of the container, so as not to oblite rate cooling channels. All the structure and functioning details remain valid 10. for them.
