# Multiplexed television signal processing system.

## Abstract
A signal processing system in a transmission system like Teletext System in which a binary signal is superimposed on a television signal for transmission is disclosed. When the binary signal is received, an upper or lower level of a pilot signal in the binary signal is clamped to a first reference voltage by a clamp circuit 33 36 while the amplitude of the pilot signal is controlled by a variable gain amplifier 26, 28, 29 such that the lower or upper level of the pilot signal becomes equal to a third reference level. The binary signal is then amplitude discriminated 40,41 using a second refer ence voltage as a discrimination reference. In this manner, the binary signal is correctly converted to a digital signal.
