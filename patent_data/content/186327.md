## Description
POLYMERIC PROCESSING AID FOR CERAMIC OR CERAMIC FORMING POWDERS AND METHOD OF USE Technical Field The invention relates to processing aids for compacting powders at ambient temperatures and, more particularly, to a polymeric aid that facilitates compaction of ceramic or ceramic forming powders at high pressures and impact rates with the resulting compacted body having improved chip strength and cohesiveness. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART STATEMENT A desirable mode for making silicon nitride objects uses reaction bonding techniques disclosed inU.S. patent 4,443,394, which utilizes a dry milling technique for preparing the powders. Such milling technique uniformly mixes the starting powder ingredients of silicon and oxygen carrying agents and obtains the desired particle size distribution for eventual good packing density during cold compaction cold compaction is usually carried out with pressures in the range of 1400 1500 psi. The cold compacted preform is then subjected to a nitriding heating in which the silicon ingredients and oxygen carrying agents are converted to silicon nitride and secondary phases the nitrided object is then subjected to a sintering heat treatment to achieve full density.Unfortunately, this technique teaches the use of a powder mixture which provides insufficient cohesive strength to withstand higher pressure and higher speed compaction necessary to greater economy and net shape processing. There is need to be able to make a more economical fused powder ceramic body in net shape form.Net shape is used herein to mean that a ceramic powder body, after fusion heat treatment, will require little or no material removal or machining to assume the desired end product configuration or shape. But economical processing of net shape fused powder bodies cannot be achieved without the use of high speed automatic equipment which place a severe strain on such bodies to maintain their integrity during processing. High speed automatic equipment is used herein to mean equipment of the type that can impart greater than 1700 psi to the compaction of the powder body such as 20,000 26,000 psi , at Impact rates in the range af 12 44 strokes minute. Such high speed automatic equipment permits large scale economics to be obtained in the manufacturing operation.To be used with such high speed automatic equipment, the starting powders must have sufficient physical and chemical properties to be compacted, usually at room temperature, using pressures up to several tens of thousands of psi and punch speeds that are fractions of a second, while the compaction action moves the powder into a wide variety of shapes. At the same time, the powder must have the ability to maintain cohesiveness after compaction so the compacted body can be ejected intact from the equipment while still maintaining the desired shape tolerances. Without an adequate processing aid, powders compacted at high pressures and impact rates do not maintain their integrity, exhibit hairline cracks or laminations, have a low chip strength of 30 40 psi, and readily break by simple handling. What is needed is a processing aid, particularly in the form of a chemical binder, which can be mixed with the powders, which aid allows the powder mixture to.be a cold compacted at the aforementioned high pressures i.e., above 15,000 psi in an automatic press and ejected intact and without flaws therefrom, b not require any additional manufacturing steps other than the conventional cold compaction and heat treatment for nitriding or sintering, and c not interfere with the chemical and physical properties of the ceramic article such as by contamination or alteration of the nitriding or sintering kinetics for the powder. Binders have been used by the prior art in powder metallurgy techniques to enhance cold compaction.The binder systems have included metal stearates such as aluminum and zinc stearates , waxes such as microcrystalline wax or halowax , organic acids such as oleic or stearic acids , polyethylene glycols and polyvinyl alcohols. Each of these binder systems form only a mechanical mixture and not a true powder composite, and have proven to be deficient in one or more of the criteria that are a measure of this invention. Aluminum stearate tends to interfere with the nitriding kinetics of making silicon nitride that is, excessive amounts of free silicon become present resulting in lamination and defects associated with such free silicon presence in lamination, is solid at room temperature rather than a viscous liquid hindering sound cold compaction at pressures in excess of 15,000 psi. Zinc stearate permits metal contamination, inhibits crystallization of desirable second phases in the silicon nitride matrix, degrades high temperature mechanical properties of the silicon nitride product, and permits flaws in the compact at pressure above 15,000 psi. Microcrystalline wax is solid at room temperature and does not become a fluid until a temperature of approximately 1900C is reached, which is well in excess of room temperature, it cannot be compacted at room temperature with pressures equal to or greater than 15,000 psi without lamination, and it renders insufficient cohesive strength to the system to tolerate high speed cold compaction. Halowax is a chlorine containing binder which inhibits the crystallization of second phases during the nitriding of silicon powders this is brought out more fully in the article by D.R. Clarke, entitled wDensification of Silicon Nitride Effect of Chlorine Impurities1, Journal of the AmericanCeramics Society, C21 22, 1982. Oleic acid has a molecular weight which Is much too low in the neighborhood of 282.5 gm mol which does not entitle it to provide strong, cohesive forces to bind the silicon particles together during compaction and fails to compact soundly at pressures greater than 15,000 psi. Stearic acid is also solid at room temperature having a melting point of approximately 710C , it has a very low molecular weight 284.5 gm mol , thu s not allowing it to have a sufficiently strong cohesive force to bind the powder system, and it fails at coldcompaction pressures equal to or greater than 15,000 psi. Polyethylene glycol such as Carbowax 600 has too low a molecular weight to be effective as a binder, it requires excessive quantities at least 6 by weight of the mixture , it lowers the alpha silicon nitride content during nitriding, it and the powder system can be compacted up to pressures of less than 10,000 psi but do not have sufficient green strength for use in high speed automatic pressing equipment, the compacted powder bodies laminate during a nitriding cycle due to rapid expansion of gases in a burnout, and it obtains poor mixing efficiency and segregates areas of high and low oxygen carrying agents such as yttrium and aluminum concentrations . Polyvinyl alcohol is disadvantageous because it is solid at room temperature, it lacks cohesive forces and lubricating ability, the compacted body with it laminates and is easily broken upon ejection from an automatic press using pressure above 10,000 psi, it has a boron impurity which contaminates the article and degrades the high temperature properties such as high temperature oxidation . Acrylic resins or latex have been mentioned as possible binders in a silicon powder system for making silicon nitride see Australian patent 73,024 and U.S.patent 3,839,540 . However, these patents do not teach the nature of the acrylic resin. The powders are cold compacted only by use of rolls at low pressures and speeds and do not process net shape bodies. Thus, the problems of this invention are not encountered. Acrylic resin is a generic term for acrylic acid or derivitives of acrylic acid that have been polymerized. A latex is a generic term for an emulsion of small polymeric particles in water. An acrylic.resin of acrylic acid polyacrylic acid fails to permit the powders to be cold compacted at high speeds and high pressures due to inadequate glass transition temperature, cohesive energy and surface tension. Polyacrylic acid is a solid at room temperature and does not properly wet the powder to form a true powder composite needed for high speed and high pressure compaction.The use of a latex fails to permit the powders to be cold compacted at high speeds and high pressures and also interferes with the nitriding and sintering kinetics of Si3N4 by altering the silicon, silicon dioxide and hydrogen content silicon powder is hydrolyzed by water resulting in the formation of silicon dioxide and the evolution of hydrogen gas according to equation 1 .EMI5.1 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention is a polymeric processing aid that facilitates compaction of ceramic or ceramic forming powders at ambient temperatures and at high pressures i.e., in excess of 1700 psi and at impact rates i.e., 12 44 strokes minute . The aid permits the resultant ceramic object formed from such powders to remain substantially unaltered with respect to chemical physical properties. The invention is also a method of making a net shape ceramic preform using the unique polymeric processing aid. The polymeric processing aid comprises a polymerized acrylate or mixed acrylate methacrylate monomers which have been polymerized, the polymer being selected to have a glass transition temperature of at least 500C below room temperature, a molar cohesive energy of 7000 20,000 cal mol, a surface tension less than 35 dyne cm, and a number average molecular weight of 4000 20,000. The monomers which have been found useful in response to such defintion include methylacrylate, butylmethacrylate, N butylacrylate, 2 ethyl hexyl acrylate, hydroxy propyl methacrylate, isobutylacrylate, lauryl methacrylate, isodecyl methacrylate, secbutylacrylate, ethyl acrylate, ethoxy ethyl acrylate, and glycidal methacrylate. The method pre ferably comprises forming a composite of ceramic or ceramic forming powders with sufficient oxygen carrying agents for forming desired secondary phases for the ceramic, along with 2 3.5 by weight of the polymeric processing aid above described.The mixture is then subjected to high speed coldcompact ion at pressures in excess of 15,000 psi with an impact rate of 12 44 strokes minute to form a net shape body. The compacted and ejected cold pressed body is heat treated to form a fully dense, net shape Si3N4 object. Preferably, the net shape for the compacted preform is within .003 .01 inch tolerance of the heat treated body, except for 12 average shrinkage.Preferably, the powder mixture comprises essentially 6 2 18.18 Y203 by weight of the powder mixture , 1.2 6.0 A1203 by weight of the powder mixture , 1 4.0 SiO2 by weight of the silicon SiO2 being usually present as a layer on the silicon metal particles . Preferably ,the heat treatment is nitrided at a temperature of 1090 1430 C 1994 26100F for a period of time sufficient to a form the desired amount of yttrium silicon oxynitride it is preferable that the yttrium silicon oxynitride consist of at least 75 of the YloSi6024N2 phase, and that the alumino silicate is amorphous and resides as a thin coating on the grains of the silicon nitride and yttrium silicon oxynitride , and b provide at least 99.5 conversion of the silicon to silicon nitride.It is preferred that the sintering be carried out at temperature level of 1650 1750 C 3002 3182 F over a time period of 0.5 12 hours. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a photograph of a nitrided powder preform fabricated by use of aluminum stearate as a processing aid during cold compaction, the photograph shows severe lamination and presence of free silicon characteristic of the prior art the photograph was taken at 8X magnification. Figure 2 is a photograph of a nitrided powder preform which was made using Carbowax 600 as a processing aid for cold compaction in accordance with the prior art the photograph shows undesirable segregated areas of high and low yttrium and aluminum concentrations the photograph was taken at 15X magnification. Figure 3 is a photograph of a nitrided powder preform made in conformity with this invention using a polymer of 85 2 ethyl hexyl acrylate and 15 hydroxy propyl methacrylate as a processing aid, the photograph shows homogeneous nitriding and the absence of lamination the photograph was taken at 15X magnification. DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND BEST MODE This invention teaches that the manufacture of silicon nitride cutting tools can be greatly reduced in cost by sintering net shape nitrided preforms, such net shape preforms being the result of large scale, high speed, cold pressing operation of a powder mixture in which a polymeric processing aid is employed to maintain integrity and cohesiveness of the net shape powder preform during such treatment. The polymeric processing aid is a polymerized acrylate or a mixed acrylate methacrylate monomer, which polymerized monomer or polymerized combination of monomers is selected to exhibit a a glass transition temperature of at least 500C below room temperature, b a molar cohesive energy of 7000 20,000 cal mol, c a number average molecular weight in the range 4000 20,000, and d a surface tension less than or equal to 35 dyne cm. It is necessary to have the proper combination of glass transition temperature, molecular weight, molar cohesive energy, and surface tension in the processing aid in order to have viscous liquid physical form at room temperature with the desired polarity, adhesion and motion on the molecular scale to wwetw the powder particles and chemically bind them together. This will result in a true powder composite and must be distinguished from just a mechanical mixture. A powder composite is necessary to permit high speed and high pressure cold compaction and obtain a sound ceramic product without flaws or undesired chemical physical properties. In addition, it is desirable that such processing aid exhibit a high purity with less than 0.5 metal, boron or halide contamination good degradation characteristics, so that it can be degraded during normal, subsequent nitriding and be nonhygroscopic. Processing aids with these characteristics enable cold compaction of ceramic or ceramic forming powders at ambient temperatures and at high pressures in excess of 15,000 psi and impact rates of 12 44 strokes minute, and will withstand ejection frpm such automatic presses without injuring the integrity of the pressed body. In addition, such pressing aids will not alter the chemical or physical properties of the resultant ceramic object to be formed from such powders. Specific examples of monomers which, when polymerized or proportioned as a mixture and polymerized, meet the above characteristics, include methylacrylate, butylmethacrylate, N butylacrylate, 2 ethyl hexyl acrylate, hydroxy propyl methacrylate, isobutylacrylate, lauryl methacrylate, isodecyl methacrylate, sec butylacrylate, ethyl acrylate, ethoxy ethyl acrylate, and glycidal methacrylate. A preferred mode for making such polymeric processing aid comprises adding T butylperoctoate in an amount of .75 gm or .5 weight percent of the monomer mixture to a dropping funnel containing a mixture of hydroxy propyl methacrylate in an amount of 22.5 gm or 15 weight percent of the mixture and 2 ethylhexylacrylate in an amount of 127.5 gm or 85 weight percent of the mixture . This mixture is then added drop wise to refluxing toluene in an amount of 150 gm , at a temperature of 100 1100C, contained in a 1000 milliliter 3 neck reaction flask equipped with a Teflon stirrer and a nitrogen inlet outlet system. The mixture is refluxed for one hour after monomer addition is completed. The entire flask is placed in an ice water mixture and cooled to room temperature.The resulting solution is then coagulated into 1000 milliliters of methanol contained in a 2000 milliliter beaker in order to remove any unreacted monomer. The decantant is poured off and the remaining polymer is washed four times with methanol. The residual methanol is evaporated on a rotary evaporator until the milky white polymer becomes a viscous, clear liquid. The resulting clear, viscous liquid polymer has a glass transition temperature of 700C and a number average molecular weight of 9000, and contains hydroxy functionality. The molar cohesive energy of such polymer is 12,000 15,500 cal mol, has a surface tension of less than 35 dyne cm, has less than 0.5 contamination of metal, boron or halide elements, and is nonhygroscopic. This polymer is importantly useful In a new method of making a net shaped, heat fused ceramic product with an ultra low amount .003 .010 inch material removal or cutting. Such method comprises a mixing a ceramic or ceramic forming powder with oxygen carrying agents powders and 2 3.5 by weight of a processing aid in the form of a polymerized acrylate or polymerized mixed acrylate methacrylate monomers having a molar cohesive energy of 7000 20,000 cal mol, Tg of at least 500C below room temperature, and a number average molecular weight of 4000 20,000, and a surface tension less than 35 dyne cm b the mixture is compacted at room temperature at a pressure in excess of 20,000 psi and at an impact rate of 12 44 strokes minute to form a body with a net shape and c thermally treating the body to form a substantially fully dense ceramic product in said net shape. Preferably, the ceramic or ceramicforming powder is silicon, and the oxygen carrying agents are 6.2 18.1 Y203 by weight of the powder mixture , 1.2 6.0 Al203 by weight of the powder mixture , 1 4.0 SiO2 by weight of the silicon SiO2 being usually present as a layer on the silicon metal particles the oxygen carrying agents and excess silicon are effective to form 4 17 silicon yttrium oxynitride normalized for conversion of silicon to silicon nitride at least 75 of which is in the y10S16 O24N2 phase and the remainder any yttrium silicon oxynitride that is formed from an SiO2 component, and a small portion of an amorphous aluminum containing silicate and up to 0.5 of silicon and unreacted Y2O3. The resultant ceramic after heat treating the above mixture is silicon nitride. A preferred mode for carrying out such method comprises mixing 2000 gm of silicon powder 85.8 weight percent of powder mixture , 278 gm of yttria 11.9 weight percent of powder mixture , 53 gm of alumina 2.27 weight percent of powder mixture , and 72 gm of the polymer processing aid in the form of polyethylhexylacrylate hydroxy propyl methacrylate 85 15 weight ratio 3.0 weight percent of total powder mixture . The usable range for the oxygen carrying agents is yttria in the amount of 6.2 18.1 by weight of the mixture or 4 12 by weight of the mixture normalized to Si3N4, alumina in the amount of 0.75 4.0 by weight of the mixture normalized to Si3N4, and silicon dioxide in the amount of 1 4.0 by weight of the silicon. Normalizing means the amount present after silicon is converted to Si3N4. The SiO2 component is essential as a component of the system to form the yttrium silicon oxynitride, thereby, by definition, eliminating the Y203 Si3N4 N melilite phase the SiO2 is usually present as an oxide surface coating on the silicon powder grains, but can be added separately if such oxide content is too low or uncontrollable.. Silicon is typically selected to have a 98 or greater purity and a starting average particle size of 2.5 3 microns with no particles exceeding 10 microns.The maJor trace metal contaminants experienced with such purity include, as a maximum Fe 1.0 , Al .5 , Mn 0.09 , and Ca 0.02 . Nonmetallic contaminants include, as a maximum carbon .05 , and 2 less than 2 after milling . Yttria is selected to have a purity of at least 99.998 with an average crystal size of .04 microns 438 angstroms . Alumina is selected to have a purity of at least 99.5 with an average particle size of .3 .5 microns. The mixture is typically comminuted and blended by being charged into an inert milling jar along with grinding media which may be in the form of Burundum cylinders 85 A1203 and 11 SiO2, 2 MgO, 1.2 CaO, .8 of lTiO2, Fe203, Na2O, K20 and milled for 48 hours at 64 rpm. The mixture is separated from the media by use of a t10 mesh screen. The milling is preferably dry, but can be wet, with some accompanying disadvantages. The yttria should be in a reactive form with a high surface area and small crystalline size. The resulting milled mixture will have at least 50 with an average particle size of about 2 microns, and 90 with an average particle size of less than 8 microns.The oxygen level after milling in air will be increased to 1.5 weight percent of the silicon and be present as an oxide coating on the silicon in an amount of about 3.0 weight percent. The ratio of Y203 Sio2 is controlled to be in the range of 1 12 and preferably about 4. A measured quantity of the milled mixture is loaded into die arrangement for pressing at 25,000 psi and at an impact rate of 12 44 strokes minute to form a net shape preform powder cutting tool compact having a size of 0.580 inch square x 0.224 inch thickness, which is .003 .010 inch, within dimensional tolerances of the fully useful, fully densified cutting tool product. This tool product would have a blank designation of SNR 430. The only difference between the net shape preform and the ultimate final fused product is compensation for 12 average shrinkage that may take place during heat fusion.The equipment used is a Mohr high speed automatic compaction press. The net shape powder compact is then nitrided by heating in a nitrogen atmosphere to produce a silicon nitride comprising net shape body consisting ofSi3N4, silicon yttrium oxynitride in an amount of 10 11 by weight of the object , .3 3.08 silicate by weight of the body , up to .5 by weight of free silicon and unreacted oxides. To carry out the nitriding heating, the compact was placed in an enclosed furnace, preferably evacuated to a pressure of less than one micron, and heated at a fast rate, i.e., 500 F 2800C hr to 12000F 6490C hr. The furnace is then filled with a gaseous mixture consisting of 72 by weight nitrogen, 3 hydrogen, and 25 helium at a pressure of about 2.7 psig.The total 2 and H2O content in such gaseous mixture is less than 4 ppm. The temperature of the furnace is then increased, in steps, from 1200 to 17000F 926 C at 5000F hr, and then to 20000F hr 10930C at 2000F hr 111OC hr , and to 2000 26000F 1093 14270C at a slower rate. The temperature is held constant thereafter. Fresh nitrogen is intermittently supplied to the furnace to replace the nitrogen consumed in forming Si N and the oxynitrides. Nitrogen is added when the pressure drops below 2.4 psig and brought back up to maximum pressure of 2.7 psig. The temperature is held constant while replenishment is taking place, but is increased when the pressure remains above 2.4 psig for a predetermined period of time.When the nitriding cycle is completed i.e., the system does not require additional nitrogen , the material may be colled to room temperature at any rate, preferably 250 F hr 1400C hr . The net shape nitrided preform is then sintered to yield a fully dense cutting tool. insert with 11 of yttrium silicon oxynitride and approximately 3 alumino silicate and beta Si3N4. Such sintering can be carried out by heating in a certain sequence up to a temperature range of 1650 1750 C 3002 31820F for a period of 5 12 hours. Said furnace uses N2 gas. Upon completion of the sintering operation, the resulting net shape sintered product will have a density of 97 theoretical. The net shape product will require no material removal to function as a cutting tool blank, except for .003 .010 inch minimal grinding stock removal.Examples To prove the advantages of the above polymerized processing aid and the process of using it, several samples were prepared. Each net shape preform was prepared in accordance with the general measurements and quantities of the preferred example disclosed earlier and the mixture was subjected to dry milling in accordance with the description of this application. The processing aid was varied among the several examples, and each was added in an amount as a percent of the mixture as indicated in Table I, except that sample 1 contained no processing aid. Each mixture was subject to high pressures at high impact rates to form a powder preform.The pressure at which hair line cracks or laminations began to appear in the ejected preform is listed under compaction behavior. All failed at pressure below 15,000 psi, except samples 2 4 which showed no flaws at pressures as high as 26,000 psi. The physical and chemical characteristics of the processing aid used is indicated only those samples which used a processing aid that had the required Tgf cohesive energy, molecular weight and surface tension provided an aid which was a viscous liquid at room temperature, so necessary to this invent ion. The resulting net shape product, after nitriding and sintering, was analyzed for the various physical and chemical characteristics as listed in Table 1, and was evaluated as to its mixing characteristics, compaction behavior, ability to not interfere with the nitriding process, and the sintering process.All of the samples were prepared in a net shape preform size of .580 inch square x .224 inch thickness, except for sample 1 which was processed as a conventional 6 inch diameter plate having a .6 inch thickness only a plate cold compacted at 1400 psi was nitrided and sintered according to the preferred mode of this invention to demonstrate reference values for physical chemical properties . Samples 8, 10 and 11 were added by wet milling in acetone after the powder mixture was dry milled. The only samples which did not fail on cold compaction in the indicated pressure range and did eject intact were samples 2 through 4. Sample 5 and 6 were defective because of too high a glass transition temperature. Sample 7 was defective because it was not a viscous liquid at room temperature and had much too low molecular weight. Sample 8 was a solid at room temperature, sample 9 was a solid at room temperature, had poor chemical and physical properties of the compact and laminated. Sample 10 had a very low final density.Samples 11, 12 and 13 were not a viscous liquid at room temperature and were not homogeneous. Samples 5 to 8 and 11 to 13 were not heat treated for analysis since the preform failed due to the presence of flaws from high pressure compaction. Specimens compacted at lower pressures as indicated were processed for heat treatment to show the influence on chemical physical properties due to the presence of the aid the specimen for samples 9 and 10, which failed at the indicated pressures, was not used for heat treatment.
