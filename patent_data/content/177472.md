# Transmission chain.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a transmission chain for trans mission of torque between one pair of driving conical discs and another pair of driven conical discs in a continuously variable transmission. According to the invention, the chain is composed of identical, interlocking links 1 in the form of blocks, the end surfaces 2 of which are bevelled at an angle Î± to fit the conical discs. Said blocks have opposite longitudinal sides 9,11 and 10,12 having means with rolling contact surfaces 5,6 for engagement with rolling contact surfaces on corresponding means of the adjacent links 1 .
