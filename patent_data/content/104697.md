## Description
PIPE PART PROVIDED WITH A FLCVJGE AND PIPE CONNECTION COMPRISING SUCH A PIPE PART. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a pipe part provided with a flange. A pipe part of this kind provided with an integral flange is known in the art. A disadvontoge of these pipe parts is that they are expensive to manufacture. Also, interconnecting the flanges of such pipe ports by means of bolts to form a flange connection, generally requires fairly great accuracy to obtain a good pipe connection. The force with which the connecting bolts are tightened particularly determines the quality of the connection. In addition, a connecting pipe part used to form a sleeve connection with a second pipe part frequently has to be connected to a pipe part provided with an integral flange, so that a connecting pipe part of this kind used to form the required connection also has to be provided with a flange. SUGARY OF THE INVENTION It is a ain object of the present invention to provide e pipe part with a flange and which is very suitable for connection to another pipe part with a flange. To this end, according to the invention, a loose flange connected to the pipe part in a tensile resistant manner tears an annular flange edge end portion, which projects or can project axially by its front face with respect to the front face of the pipe part. By using a loose flange connected to the pipe part so as to be tensile resistant a suitable pipe part can always be provided with a flange whenever so required, while if vouch flange is not required it con be caitted. Connecting a flange to a pipe part in a tensile resistant manner also provides the opportunity of ensuring that an annular flange edge end portion projects or can project axially by its front face with respect to the front face of the pipe part. As a result, the flange of another pipe part will abut the end face of the projecting flange edge end portion, so that the front face of the pipe part lies on the inside with respect to the front face of the flange edge end portion. In this way, a very good seal can be obtained be tween the front face of the pipe part and the flange of the other pipe part, by means of an annular sealing means, be cause the distance between the same is determined by the axial difference between the front face of the pipe part and the front face of the projecting flange edge end portion, so that the sealing means can be compressed to n specific amount. Also, the force by which the front face of the annul ler flange edge end portion is pressed against the flange of the other pipe part does not affect the quality of the seal. The pipe part is very advantageously connected to an annular sealing means extending over the front face of the pipe part, the maximum thickness of said sealing means being greater than the axial distance between the surface of the front face of the pipe part and the front face of the projecting flange edge end portion. The advantage of this embodiment is a very good sealing by leans of the annular sealing means, stich bears against the front face of the pipe part end a front face of the flange of another pipe part without the forces exert ed by belts of a flange connection determining the compres sion of the sealing means. Advantageously, the annular sealing leans is retained in the inner side of. the pipe part by leans of a retaining ring, preferably a T shaped retaining ring. It is particularly advantageous for an internal groove of the loose flange to co operate with a circumferentially interrupted annular retaining means which in turn engages an external groove in the pipe part the annular retaining peons preferably lying with clearance in the external groove of the pipe part for the internal groove of the loose flange. In this way it is possible to ensure that the front face of the flange edge end portion does not project with respect to the front face of the pipe part during transport.and that in a completed pipe connection formed with a pipe part according to the invention, the flange edge end portion projects outwardly by its front face with respect to the front face of the pipe part. SURVEY OF w DRAWI S The drawing is a cross section through a pipe port according to the invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In the drawing a plastic pipe part, mare particularly a pipe part of thermoplastic material such as palyvinyichioride or polyethylene, comprises an external groove 18 in which a circumferentially interrupted annular plastic retaining member 6 is received with clearance between the outer boundary walls 18o and 18b of the groove. A flange 5 provided with a cylindrical edge portion 21 has an internal groove 22, also receiving the circumferentially interrupted annular retaining member 6 with clearance. The tensile resistant connection between the flange 5 and the pipe part 1 is formed by pushing the flange 5 from the outside over the interrupted retaining member 6, which is usually in the form of a plastic bar material interrupted at a point of its circumference. The flange 5 is provided with apertures 19 for the passage of bolts to connect with a flange of another pipe part not shown . On its front face 13 the pipe part 1 also bears an annular sealing means 7 being retained on the inner side of the pipe port 1 by aeons of a T shoped retaining ring 8, disposed in a groove 14. In the outermost positon, the annular end part 21 of the flange edge projects with respect to the front face 13 of the pipe part 1. It is thus possible to achieve op tilum sealing by providing an annular sealing neons 7 against the front face 13 of the pipe part 1, because the forces exerted by the connecting bolts of a flange connection do not determine the compression of the sealing means. Pipe port I is also provided with an inner groove 10, 11 to receive a pipe sealing means 4, a front part 10 there of being retained by another retaining ring 3, while the free end portion 11 of the pipe sealing leans 4 is received in a groove chamber 23. Pipe part 1 is further provided with another internal groove 9 to receive an annular pipe coupling means 2, which can be received in the said inner groove 9 via a bore in the wall. The annular pipe coupling eeans 2, usually in the for of a plastic bar material, edge of polythylene, may engage a groove 17 in a portion 16 glued upon e male pipe part 15. The pipe part 1 and the male pipe part 15 advantageously consist of a thermoplastic. The loose flange 5 advantageous ly consists of metal or reinforced thermosetting plastic.
