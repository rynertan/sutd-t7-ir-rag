## Description
LIGHTWEIGHT FILLER COMPOSITION This invention relates to a lightweight filler composition having uniquc properties and to a method of making filler compositions. One of the most difficult tasks for the amateur interested in do it yourself to perform satisfactorily is plastering Xnown do it yourself plastering compositions are either limited in the extent to which a thick layer of the material can be built up or have an unsatisfactory texture when applied, being too dry and crumbly in nature.The present invention is concerned with a composition which may be used as a do it yourself plaster composition or base render which may also be used, for exampl2 in repointing or as a general purpose filler. The present invention permits the application of thick layers of material which aze very smooth cqmpared to existing renders and which do not crack upon drying. The composition of the present invention is also unique in the combination of its workability, lightweight nature and ability to be modified either for outside or for inside use.The cornositional aspects of this invention are based upon the discovery of the advantages of using a closed. ,a.s filled, discrete sphere ceramic filler in a particular weight ratio with water so as to give the unique combination of properties referred to. According to the present invention there is provided a lightweight filler composition comprising a closed, gasfilled, discrete sphere ceramic filler, a thixotropic rheology modifier, a water dispersible resin, and water, the weight ratio filler water in the composition being from about 1.3 1 to about 2.2 1. The invention also provides, in another aspect, a for preparing a lightweight filler composition, which method includes the step of mixing a thixotropic rheology modifier and water in the absence of filler and using sufficient shear to form a gel therefrom, and mixing the resulting gel with a closed, gas filled, discrete sphere ceramic filler and, if not present during said gel formation, a waterdispersible resin The method is preferably performed at a temperature above OOC and at least part of the water mixed with the thixotro ic rheology modifier may be.provided by the waterdispersible resin being in the form of an aqueous emulsion.Naturally, it is highly preferred that the method be operated to provide a filler composition in which the filler ater ratio is as secified above However, the invention is nct limited to the provision of compositions having this particular filler water ratio since the apprecation of the need to provide an independent step wherein water and the thixotropic rheology modifier are mixed in the absence of filler in order to get z satisfactory composition consistency provides an independent aspect of the present inventive concert. A suitable filler material is the material knoam asFillite which is available from Fillite Runcorn Limited of Runcorn, Cheshire, U.K. Fractured sphere fillers, e.g.perlite, are unsuitable for use in the present invention.Fillite is ideally suited to the present invention because of its lightweight and inert nature. Fillite may be described as an almost white,free flowing,hollow,microsphere material which has, generally, a surface moisture of at most 0.58 and a hardness of Moh s scale 5. In terms of environmental hazard, Fillite is similar to talc, rouye etc.The long term effects of continued exposure are minimised as spheres below 5 microns diameter are not present.In fact, the grade of material preferred for use in the present invention is specified as 52 7 S which means that the average particle size sphere diameter is 52 microns and the sphere density is 0.7. Other grades of the material are available but the 52 7 S grade is preferred for the present invention. The Fillite shell material basically comprises alumina, silica and iron and the gas filling is primarily nitrogen and carbon di oxide. The thixotrqtic rheology modifier used in the present invention is preferably a thickening material chosen from vater swellable clays such a laponite or hentonite , methacrylate th ckeners which are usually in the form of emulsions which gel at a pli above 9 , polyacrylamieles or cellulose ethers,e.g. hydroxyethyl cellulose or methylcellulose. The use of water swellable clays is preferred.Of course, more than one such material may be present and it is often preferred to employ a cellulose ether thickener in addition to a water swellable clay. In one preferred embodiment the thixotropic rheology modifier comprises laponite, and methyl cellulose and or hydroxyethyl cellulose. In the compositions of the present invention the filler water ratio is essentially between about 1.3 1 and about 2.2 1 Preferably this ratio is from about 1.5 1 to about 2 1. The most preferred ratio is about 1.7 1. The resins which are used in the present invention are preferably employed in the form of aqueous emulsicns. Such resins are preferably homopolymers or copolymers of ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as olefins, such as ethylene, propylene unsaturated carboxylic acids and alkyl esters thereof, for example acrylic, methacrylic, itaconic, umaric and maleic acids1 methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, n butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, 2 ethyl hexyl acrylate, n butyl methacrylate, di n butyl maleate, di nbutyl fumarate, and n lauryl methacrylate vinyl and vinylidene halides, for example.vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride vinyl esters or carboxylic acids, for example vinyl acetate, vinyl proprionate, and the vinyl esters of mixes tertiary C10 carboxylic acids butadiene and isoprene acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile and styrene and inl toluene. The content of water dispersible resin in the compositions of the present invention may be as low as 5 referring to solids . However, it is preferred that the resin content be approximately from 10 to 15 again based on the solids content . Since a part of the water of the overall composition is provided, in preferred compositions, by the resin in aqueous emulsion form, any reduction in the quantity of resin must be compensated for by an increase in water amount in order to maintain the correct filler water ratio. An increase in the filler water ratio above about 2.2 1 results in a product which becomes rather too dry and crumbly for completely satisfatory operation. On the other hand, a decrease in the ratio to lower than about 1.3 1 results in a product which is too runny and wet and this spoils the ease of attlication of the product. Various other ingredients may.be included in the compositions of the present invention, e.. preservatives, antifoaming agents, fibrous materials, pigments, insulating materials, and or plasticizers. Preferred fibrous materials, which impart greater structural strength to the product, are glassfibres, polyester fibres, and or carbon fibres A preferred plasticizer is dibutylphthalat. As a suitable insulating material can be mentioned polystyrene beads generally of approximately 1 mm diameter The presence of such beads in the compositions of . he present invention reatly increases their thermal insulating properties.Titanium pigmants which provide whitening to the composition may be added, as may other ointments. Generally speaking, tE, quantity of pigment should not be increased above 5 by weight based on the overall composition. The preservative is a biocidal material which prevents interference from organisms such as fungal sores. The use of anti foaming agents is preferred because during the preparating of the present compositions aeration of the paste like material may be a problem in the absence of an anti foaming agent. As already indicated, in manufacturina compositions in accordance with the method of the present invention the application of sufficient shear to form a gel from the rheology modifier and water is important. A high shear mixer is therefore used, a suitable mixer being the mixer available from Mastermix Ltd. of Redditch under Model No. PMD Mark 4 and 5. Other high shear mixers may, of course, be used. The compositions of the present invention may be painted directly onto surfaces such as walls but are preferably applied after the application to such surfaces of primers or undercoats conventional in the art. The composition of the present invention may be used to fill cracks and gaps in, for example, walls but should not be used in load bearing circumstances. The comPosition can be readily decorated by the Incorporation therein of suitable pigments or, after appli cation in layers , can have conventional decorating materials applied thereto. A fine particle c iz plaster composition may be applied over a layer of the present compoJition to provide a smooth surface if desired.The present invention is perfectly capable of providing thick layers of material up to about two inches thick.Certainly irregularities in pre existing surfaces of up to 1 inches thick can be filled and covered in one coat using the present compositions. In general terms, the present compositions are ready mixed, lightweight building compounds which can be used for most building repairs and filling operations The invention includes, of course, a method of filling, plastering, rendering, repointingpor laying of building blocks which comprises the use of a composition as defined above in a manner known per se save only for the ability to provide a layer of the composition of up to to inches thick.
