# Circuit switching arrangement.

## Abstract
An electronic circuit switching arrangement uses distri buted control of switching to permit high speed connections. A signal appearing at an originating terminal A seeking a destination terminal B is propagated through a multiple of stages 200, 225, 242 forming one control path between the originating and terminating terminals toward that destina tion. Terminals at the final stages that are idle are precon nected electrically to terminals at an intermediate stage. When a signal requesting a oesignated terminal is proces sed, a scanning or commutating operation associated with only the originating terminal is initiated, proceeding from terminal to terminal of the intermediate stage. Once an idle or available intermediate terminal is reached, com mutation is halted and the switch connections made. Thus no more time is consumed in scanning for this particular connection.
