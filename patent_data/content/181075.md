## Abstract
A mouth in the upper edge of Petri dish 1 proper is covered with at least one sheet 2 and at least one small aperture 4 is provided on the bottom 3 of said Petri dish 1 . Partitions 8 may be installed between the bottom 3 of the Petri dish 1 and the sheet 2 , and a sealing lid 6 fitted in the small aperture 4 .
