# Ferrule attachment.

## Abstract
A ferrule for making a secure connection to a cable 16 for supporting a safety belt buckle comprises a tubular body 10 . A U shaped loop 14 is formed in the cable and inserted into one end of the tubular body 10 which is then crimped to grip the cable and hold the projecting ends 16, 18 thereof at a required orientation.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A ferrule for making a secure connection to a cable 16 for supporting a safety belt buckle comprises a tubular body 10 for receiving the cable 16 , characterised in that a U shaped loop 14 is formed in the cable and inserted into one end of the tubular body 10 which is then crimped to grip the cable 14 ar,d hold the projecting ends 16,18 thereof at a required orientation. 2. A ferrule according to claim 1, characterised in that the tubular body 10 has a pair of aligned transverse holes 12 extending through the walls thereof, the cable 14 being inserted into the tubular body 10 to beyond the holes 12 so as to surround a member 22 inserted therethrough. 3. A ferrule according to claim 1, characterised in that the tubular body 24 is cut away on one side at the end 26 opposite to that from which the cable 16 is inserted, a single hole being provided on the other side of the body 24 , in alignment with the cut away portion. 4. A ferrule according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that the tubular body 10 is bent at a location 20 between the hole 12 and the end from which the cable 16 projects, so that the cable 16 is held at an acute angle to the plane perpendicular to the axis of the hole 12 . 5. A ferrule according to any preceding claim, characterised in that a respective buckle 34,36 is connected to each end 30,32 of the cable.

## Description
Ferrule Attachment This invention relates to a ferrule for making a secure connection to a cable for supporting a safety belt buckle. According to tse invention, a ferrule for making a secure connection to a cable for supportin a safety belt buckle comprises a tubular body, a U shaped loop formed ifl the cable and inserted into one end of the tubular body which is then crimped to grip the cable and hold the projecting ends thereof at a required orientation. Preferably, the tubular body has a pair of aligned transverse holes extending through the walls thereof, the cable being inserted into the tubular body to beyond the holes so as to surround a member inserted therethrough. Alternatively, the tubular body may be cut away on one side at the end opposite to that from which the cable is inserted, a single hole being provided on the other side of the body, in alignment with the cut away portion. In one form of the invention which is particularly applicable to securing the cable to an anchorage which is to be attached to the floor of a motor vehicle, the tubular body is bent at a location between the holes and the end from which the cable projects, so that the cable is held at an acute angle to the plane perpendicular to the axis of the holes. An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a transverse cross sectional view of a ferrule attachment in accordance with the invention, for securing a cable to an anchorage for attachment to the floor of a motor car, Figure 2 is a cross sectional view taken on the line 2 2 in Figure 1, Figure 3 is a cross sectional view taken on the line 3 3 in Figure 1, Figure 4 is a perspective view of another embodiment of the invention, and Figure 5 is a perspective view of a further embodiet of the invention. The body 10 has a pair of aligned holes 12 extending transversly therethrough. A U shaped loop is formed in a cable 14 and inserted into one end of the tubular body 10 to beyond the holes 12 so that the limbs 16 and 18 of the U shape project from the end of the tubular body from which the loop was inserted. The tubular body is then crimped in a direction perpendicular to the plane containing both limbs 16 and 18 of the U shape so as to grip the cable 14, as can best be seen in Figure 2. At the same time, the tubular body 10 is bent at 20 so that the projecting limbs 16 and 18 of the U shape are angled upwards relative to the plane perpendicular to the axis of the holes 14.In use, the attachment is secured to the floor or top of the transmission tunnel of a motor car, for example by means of a bolt 22 projecting through the holes 12, with the limb 16 angled upwards so that a buckle not shown on the free end thereof is supported in a conveniently accessible position relative to the vehicle seat. Figure 4 shows an alternative embodiment in which the cable 14 is retained in a tubular body 24 having a cut away zone on one side of the end 26 opposite to that from which the limbs 16 and 18 of theU shaped loop project. The bolt 22 projects through a washer 28 which lies in the cut away zone, then between the limbs 16 and 18 of theU shape and then through a hole, similar to the holes 12, in the other side of the end 26. In both of the embodiments.described above, the limb 18 is shown as terminating a short distance beyond the adjacent end of the tubular member 10. Figure 5 shows a further embodiment having two limbs 30 and 32 of equal length and each supporting a respective buckle 34, 36 so that the two buckles for adjacent front seats are secured by the same ferrule attachment. A ferrule attachment in accordance with the invention may also be used to secure a buckle to the free end of a cable such as the cable 14.
