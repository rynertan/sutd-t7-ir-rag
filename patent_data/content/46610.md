# Television camera tube.

## Abstract
A television camera tube comprising in an evacuated envelope 1 an electron gun 6 to generate an electron beam which during operation of the tube is focused to form a spot on a photosensitive target 3 , on which target a potential distribution is formed by projecting an optical image on it, which target, by scanning with an electron beam, provides signals corresponding to the said optical image, which scanning takes places in a line deflection direction and a frame deflection direction. When according to the invention the spot has an elongate shape, which shape is determined by a line at the edge of the spot which interconnects points having the same current density and of which 1.4 k 2 where k is the ratio between the lengths of the long and short axes of the spot and the long axis of the spot divides the acute angle between the line deflection direction and the frame deflection direction in such manner that 0 β 60 where β is the angle between the long axis and the frame deflection direction, a television camera tube is obtained the modulation depth of which is larger than in comparable tubes having a circular spot and the modulation depth of which is moreover less and substantially symmetrically dependent on the orientation of the usual test pattern for the modulation depth.
