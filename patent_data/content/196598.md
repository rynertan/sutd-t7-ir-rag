# Spacer grid of a nuclear reactor fuel assembly.

## Abstract
The invention relates particularly to an improved spacer grid for laterally supporting the fuel rods in a nuclear fuel assembly by means of dimples and springs formed on the grid straps which define cells having the fuel rods ertending therethrough. Each of the dimples 46 and springs 46 is an elongate member which arches from the associated grid strap 24 and is provided with a fuel rod supporting surface 70 56 contoured to cradle the fuel rod. Preferably, each dimple and each spring has flanges formed along the longitudinal edges thereof and angled toward the grid strap on which the dimple or spring is formed. The cradling surfaces cushion vibrational impacts upon the fuel rods, minimize fuel rod scratching during loading and unloading of the fuel rods, and promote centering of the fuel rods in the respective grid cells. The angled flanges along the edges of the dimples and springs aid in minimizing scratching.
