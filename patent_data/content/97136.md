# Rock drilling apparatus.

## Abstract
A rock drilling apparatus for drilling with high pressure hydraulic jet including a rock drill body 11 , a drill tool 12 coupled to said body 11 and a feeding device 15 with a mo tor 16 for feeding said body and tool to and fro the working face. The drilling tool 12 has an inner rotating tube 40 with a high pressure nozzle body 41 at the nose thereof and an outer tube 42 surrounding said inner tube 40 . Said outer tube 42 is provided with a hard metal collar 61 at the front end for protecting the nozzle body 41 and for calibration of the drill hole size. A sensing device including a pressure operat ed switch 73 and an adjustable time relay 83 is adapted for sensing the feed resistance met by said collar 61 and causing said feed motor 16 to retract said drill body 11 and tool 12 when a preset value of the resistance is exceeded.
