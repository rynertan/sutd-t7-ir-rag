# Process for producing carbon fiber.

## Abstract
A process for producing carbon fiber is disclosed, which comprises a preoxidation step for heating in an oxidizing atmosphere and converting precursor fibers into partially oxidized fibers, an oxidizing step for heating in an oxidizing atmosphere and converting the partially oxidized precursor fibers into oxidized fibers, and a carbonization step for heating in an inert atmosphere and converting the oxidized fibers into carbonized fibers, in which in the preoxidation step the precursor fibers are heated at a temperature of about 200 to 250 C and in which a portion or the whole of exhaust gas from the oxidation step is supplied into the preoxidation step as oxidation atmosphere gas and the exhaust gas from the preoxidation step is subjected to a burning treatment.
