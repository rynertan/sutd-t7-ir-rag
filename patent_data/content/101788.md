# Accumulator and transponder for time related data.

## Abstract
A computer implemented data accumulating system, which includes a counter for receiving and accumulating data pulses, a clock source for providing time of day information relative to the accumulation of the data pulses, a memory coupled to the clock source for storing a manifesta tion of the correct time, the clock source powered in the event of primary power failure by an auxiliary power source, and logic circuitry activated upon the restoration of the primary power source to transfer a correct time of day indication from the clock source to the memory.
