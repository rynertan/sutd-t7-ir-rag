## Description
PREPARATION OF ETHYL ACETATE This invention relates to a process for the preparation of ethyl acetate by hydrogenating acetic anhydride or mixtures of acetic anhdyride and ethylidene diacetate. The hydrogenation of acetic anhydride using a nickel catalyst in the presence of a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, or methane sulfonic acid, is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,221,918. The products obtained are reported to be ethylidene diacetate, acetic acid and, when hydrochloric acid was the acid used, l chloroethyl acetate. When ethyl acetate is the desired product, this prior art process is impractical. The process of this invention provides a very effective method of making ethyl acetate. In accordance with this invention acetic anhydride or a mixture of acetic anhydride and ethylidene diacetate is hydrogenated with Raney nickel as the hydrogenation catalyst to form ethyl acetate. The feed to the hydrogenation reactor can, if desired, contain, in addition to acetic anhydride and or ethylidene diacetate, an inert solvent such as acetic acid. The acetic acid in the product from the reaction can be converted to methyl acetate and used in the production of acetic anhydride. Acetic anhydride containing little if any ethylidene diacetate, e.g., up to about 10 weight percent, can be readily hydrogenated to produce ethyl acetate in good product yields and space time yields. However, the presence of larger amounts of ethylidene diacetate inhibits the conversion of acetic anhydride to products and thus, the use of more severe reaction conditions or an organic sulfonic acid is necessary to satisfactorily hydrogenate mixtures of acetic anhydride and ethylidene diacetate to form ethyl acetate. The concentration of the Raney nickel that is used is in the range of 0.1 to 10 weight percent, based on the acetic anhydride and, when present, ethylidene diacetate. Catalyst concentrations same basis of 0.5 to 2.5 weight percent will most often be used. The temperature for the reaction is in the range of 100 to 2500C., although at the higher temperatures ethyl acetate decomposition can be a problem. Pressures total reaction pressure in the range of 500 to 5000 psig 3550 to 34590 kPa may be used, although the use of pressures in excess of 2500 psig 17340 kPa normally is not advantageous. The preferred temperatures and pressures vary depending on whether the material being hydrogenated consists primarily of acetic anhydride or consists of a mixture of acetic anhydride and ethylidene diacetate, e.g. mixtures of acetic anhydride and ethylidene diacetate in weight ratios of about 4 1 to 1 4.When the material being hydrogenated consists primarily of acetic anhydride, the preferred temperatures and pressures are in the range of 130 to 2000C., especially 130 to 1500C., and 500 to 1500 psig 3550 to 10445 kPa . When the material is a mixture of acetic anhydride and ethylidene diacetate, preferred temperatures and pressures are 170 to 2500C., especially 200 to 2250C., and 2000 to 2500 psig 13895 to 17340 kPa . When a substantial amount of ethylidene diacetate is fed to the reaction with the acetic anhydride, for example 50 50 weight mixtures, the ethylidene diacetate resists hydrogenation and retards the hydrogenation of the acetic anhydride.Consequently, relatively severe reaction conditions are required to hydrogenate such mixtures to ethyl acetate when only Raney nickel is used in the reaction. Much milder reaction conditions can be used to hydrogenate such mixtures to ethyl acetate if an organic sulfonic acid is used in the reaction medium. The organic sulfonic acid enables the use of milder, more economical reaction conditions and it results in higher conversions of acetic anhydride and ethylidene diacetate to ethyl acetate. The amount of organic sulfonic acid that is used is within the range of 0.1 to 3 weight percent, based on the total weight of acetic anhydride and ethylidene diacetate. The preferred amount is 0.5 to 1.5 weight percent. Of the many organic sulfonic acids that can be used, the lower alkyl and aryl sulfonic acids are preferred. The most preferred are methanesulfonic acid and p toluenesulfonic acid because of their relatively low cost. When an organic sulfonic acid is used in the hydrogenation process, the reaction temperature can be in the range of 1300C. to 175 C., and the reaction pressure can be in the range of 500 to 3000 psig. 3550 to 20790 kPa . The process of the invention may be carried out as a batch operation or, more suitably, as a continuous process wherein acetic anhydride or mixtures of acetic anhydride and ethylidene diacetate are continuously fed to an autoclave and reaction mixture containing the desired products are continuously removed either as a liquid or as a vapor. Unreacted materials and co product acetic acid may be removed from the reaction mixture after removal from the autoclave by distillation and recycled to the autoclave. The process of the invention is further illustrated by the following examples.EXAMPLES 1 18 Acetic anhydride 100 g. and mixtures of acetic anhdyride 50 g. and ethylidene diacetate 50 g. were hydrogenated in the presence of varying amounts of Raney nickel using different temperatures and total autoclave pressures. The material hydrogenated in Examples 1 7 was acetic anhydride and inExamples 8 18 it was a 50 50 mixture of acetic anhydride and ethylidene diacetate. The acetic anhydride, ethylidene diacetate when used and Raney nickel catalyst were loaded into a 300 ml. stainless steel, rocking autoclave. The autoclave was purged with 100 psig 739 kPa hydrogen gas pressure at room temperature and then the gas was vented. The internal pressure of the autoclave was increased to 10 psig 172 kPa by adding hydrogen gas at room temperature.The autoclave was sealed and heated and rocked until reaction temperature was reached, at which time additional hydrogen gas was added to increase the autoclave internal pressure to the predetermined value. The time at which the autoclave internal pressure reached the predetermined value was taken as the start of the reaction time. A reaction time of 2 hours was used in Examples 1 16 and 1 hour in Examples 17 and 18. Reaction pressure was maintained at the preset value during the reaction by adding hydrogen gas at the same rate at which it was consumed by the reactants. When the predetermined reaction time was completed the autoclave was cooled by a stream of cold air. After the gas was vented from the autoclave the reaction product was analyzed by gas chromatographic methods.
