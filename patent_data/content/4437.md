## Description
The present invention relates to a motor vehicle fault indication system having a display device which includes a face marked with a legend. In a known type of motor vehicle fault indication system, each fault is indicated by an associated display device having a face marked with a suitable legend, such as a tap for a low level in an engine coolant reservoir, and a lamp for illuminating the face. However, as the number of faults which it is desired to indicate increases, it is becoming difficult to design a suitable legend for each individual fault. According to the present invention there is provided a motor vehicle fault indication system including a display device comprising a face marked with a legend and a means for illuminating the face and at least two fault detecting transducers associated with the display device for controlling the illuminating means. As a single display device is associated with at least two fault detecting transducers, it is only necessary to design a single legend for the faults monitored by these transducers. Preferably, the illuminating means is normally controlled by one of the transducers, but in a predetermined circumstance or in predtermined circumstances controlled by the other transducer or transducers. The present invention will now be described in more detail by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a circuit diagram of a motor vehicle fault indication system embodying the present invention, and Figure 2 is a truth table of the operation of the system of Figure 1. Referring now to Figure 1 there is shown a motor vehicle fault indication system which is installed in a motor vehicle. The motor vehicle includes a conventional internal combustion engine having a spark ignition system, and a water cooling system and associated coolant reservoir.The engine is lubricated by an oil lubrication system which is associated with an oil reservoir. The vehicle also includes a screen washer reservoir for providing a jet of water for washing the windscreen of the vehicle. As will now be described the system is capable of indicating a low level in the coolant reservoir or the screen washer reservoir and is also capable of indicating faults in the oil lubricating system. The system comprises a battery 10 having its negative terminal connected to earth and its positive terminal connected to an input terminal of an ignition switch I having four operating positing positions Ia, Ib, Ic, and Id.The position Ia is an toff position. In the position Ib, the input terminal is connected to a supply line 12 and in the position Ic the input terminal is connected to the supply line 12 and to a supply line 14. The supply line 14 is also connected to the ignition system, and so the position Ic is the normal driving position of the switch. In the positionId, the input terminal is connected to the supply line 14 and also to a relay, not shown, for operating a starter motor. Thus, the position Id is the position for starting the vehicle. The supply line 12 is connected through two series connected resistors R1, R2 to the supply line 14 and the supply line 14 is connected through a resistor R3 to earth.The junction of the resistor R1 and R2 is connected to the base of a p n p transistor T1, the emitter of which is connected to the supply line 12 and the collector of which is connected through a relay coil B1 of a relay B to earth.The supply line 14 is also connected through a push button switch S and the windings of a motor 16 to earth. The motor 16 drives a pump positioned in the screen washer reservoir. The junction of the switch S and motor 16 is connected to the anode of a diode D1, the cathode of which is connected to the junction of the collector of transistorT1 and relay coil The supply line 12 is connected through a lamp 18 forming part of a display device to an input terminal of a relay switch B2 of the relay B. The display device com prises a face marked with a legend depicting a tap to indicate low water level and a means for illuminating the face in the form of the lamp 18. The relay switch B2 has two output terminals which are connected respectively through two fault detecting tranducers in the form of float switches WL and CL to earth.The input terminal is normally connected to the output terminal associated with the float switch CL but, on energization of the relay coilB, is connected instead to the output terminal associated with the float switch WL. The float switch CL is positioned in the engine coolant reservoir and the float switch WL is positioned in the screen washer reservoir. Each float switcheS closes when the liquid in its respective reservoir falls below a predetermined level. The line 14 is also connected through two series connected resistors R4 and R to earth. The junction of the resistors R4 and R is connected through a resistor R6 to the junction of the lamp 18 and the input terminal of the switch B2 and also to the base of an npn transistor T2.The collector of the transistor T2 is connected via a resistor R13 to the line 12 and the emitter is connected to earth. The collector of transistor T2 is also connected to the anode of a diode D2, the cathode of which is connected to the collector of an npn transistor T3. The collector of transistor T is also connected to the line 14 3 through a resistor R7 and the emitter of transistor T3 is connected to earth. The line 14 is also connected through a lamp 20 and an oil pressure switch PL to earth. The lamp 20 forms part of a display device, generally similar to the display device associated with the lamp 18 except that its face is marked with a legend depicting an oil can to indicate low oil pressure. The line 14 is also connected through a resistorR8 and a float switch QL to earth. The float switch QL is positioned in the oil reservoir and closes when the oil falls below a predetermined level.The junction of the resistorR8 and the float switch QL is connected to the base of the transistor T3 through a resistor R9 and the junction of the lamp 20 and the oil pressure switch PL is connected to the base of the transistor T3 through a resistor R100 The base 3 of transistor T3 is connected to earth through a resistor R110 The collector of transistor T3 is connected to earth through a resistor R12 and also connected to the base of a transistor T4, the collector of which is connected through a buzzer 22 to the supply line 12 and the emitter of which is connected to earth. The operation of the fault indication system will now be described with reference to the truth table shown inFigure 2. If the ignition switch I is in the position Ia, no fault will be indicated. If the ignition switch I is moved to the position Ib, the line 12 is energized, the transistor T1 is rendered conductive, the relay coil B is energized as indicated by 1 in Figure 2, and the float switches WL is connected in series with the lamp 18. If the float switch WL is open, it will prevent illumination of the lamp 18 but current will be supplied to the base of transistor T2 thereby rendering this transistor conductive.If the float switch iL is closed, the lamp 18 will be illuminated, thereby providing a visual indication that the water in the screen washer reservoir is below the predetermined level, and the current will be removed from the base of the transistor T22 , thereby render ing it non conductive, rendering transistor T4 conductive and energizing the buzzer 22 to provide an audio indication that the water is below the predetermined level. The current supplied to the line 14 through resistors R1 and R2 will be insufficient to illuminate the lamp 20. With the switch I in the position Ig, the line 14 is at a voltage too low to provide base current to transistors T2, T3 and T4. Hence the buzzer 22 is energized only if the switch WL is closed enabling base current to flow to transistor T4 through diode D2. Thus, when the ignition switch I is in the positionIb, the condition of the lamp 18 and the buzzer 22 will depend upon the condition of the float switch WL, as indicated by n WLX in Figure 2, and so the level of water in the screen washer reservoir may be checked by moving the ignition switch into this position. If the switch I is moved into the position Ic, which is the normal driving position, both lines 12 and 14 will be energized thereby rendering the transistor T1 non conductive. With the switch in this position, the float switch CL will normally be connected in series with the lamp 18 with the result that the lamp 18 will be illuminated if the float switch CLis closed, thereby indicating that the water in the coolant reservoir is below the predetermined level.However, if the switch S is depressed to energize the motor 16, relay coil B will be energized and the float switch WL will be connected in series with the lamp 18 which will now only be illuminated if the float switch WL is closed.Thus, with the switch I in the position Ib, the condition of the lamp 18 will depend on the condition of the float switch CL if the switch S is not depressed or upon the condition of the float switch WL if the switch S is depressed. This is indicated in Figure 2 by CL.S WL.S . With the switch I in the position Ic, the lamp 20 will be illuminated if the pressure switch PL is closed, thereby providing a visual indication of low oil pressure.This is indicated in Figure 2 by PL . Also with the switch I in the position Ic, the transistor T2 will be rendered conductive as line 14 is energized and so the condition of the float switch WL and CL will not affect operation of the buzzer 22. If either or both of the switches QL, PL are open, the base of transistorT3 will receive base current through either or both of the resistors R8 R9, thereby rendering the transistor T3 conductive, the transistor T4 non conductive and preventing energization of the buzzer 22. However, if both switchesQL, PL are closed, the transistor T3 will be rendered nonconductive, and the transistor T4 will be rendered conductive thereby energizing the buzzer 22 to provide an audio indication of low oil pressure combined with low oil level in the oil reservoir.This is indicated in Figure 2 by PL QL . If the ignition switch is moved to the position Id, which is the position for starting the engine, the line 12 will no longer be energized and so the lamp 18 and the buzzer 22 will be inoperative, as is indicated in Figure 2 by 0 . However, the condition of lamp 20 will still depend on the condition of the float switch PL. Thus, the lamp 18 is used to indicate both a low level in the screen washer reservoir and in the engine coolant reservoir the lamp 18 being normally controlled by the float switch C.L, but being controlled by the float switch WLin certain predetermined circumstances, namely when the ignition switch I is in the position Ib, or when the washer switch S is depressed. As the lamp 18 is used for both these purposes it is only necessary to design a single legend. The fault indication system described above could be extended to include other display devices which are used to indicate two or more faults. For example, this system could include a display device for indicating both a low level in a clutch fluid reservoir and a low level in a brake fluid reservoir, the display device being controlled by a float switch in the brake fluid reservoir when the switch I is in the position Ic and by a float switch in the clutch fluid reservoir when the ignition switch is in the position Ib. It will be appreciated that the circuit shown inFigure 1 makes use of normally open switches WL, CLt QL PL, which are standard, readily available float operated and pressure switches. If desired, however, normally closed switches could be specially made for the circuit, but this would involve some circuit modifications. A further modification which may be thought desirable is an arrangement for preventing continuous operation of the warning devices with the ignition switch in its auxiliaryonly position. This would involve incorporating a timer to turn off the warning devices after a predetermined time if the ignition contacts of the ignition switch were not closed.
