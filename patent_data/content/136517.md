# DETERMINISTIC MULTI ACCESS METHOD FOR A DECENTRALIZED MOBILE RADIO SYSTEM

## Abstract
A mobile radio system uses a predetermined number of control channels over which a hand shake routine is per formed to determine called station availability, before one of a limited number of talk channels local and repeater is assigned for communication between a calling and the called station. After locating an idle talk channel local channels are searched first , the control channel to which the called station is predeterminedly assigned is attempted to be accessed. Transmission times on the control channel are a function of the called station s identification code, thus creating a logical ring. Provision is made for message based priorities, emergency numbers and high priority for stations having experienced a previous unsuccessful attempt to access a control channel.
