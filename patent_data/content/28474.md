# Process for producing vinyl acetate, acetic acid and ethanol.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for producing vinyl acetate from methanol carbon monoxide and hydrogen which comprises the following five steps a methanol is hydrocarbonylated in a hydrocarbonyla tion zone to produce ethanol, acetaldehyde, methyl acetate and dimethylacetal, and the products are separated in a sep aration zone b methyl acetate is carbonylated in a carbonylation zone to produce acetic anhydride c the acetaldehyde and dimethylacetal produced in the step a and the acetic anhydride produced in the step b are converted to ethylidene diacetate and methyl acetate d the ethylidene diacetate produced in the step c is thermally decomposed to vinyl acetate and acetic acid, and the products are separated in a separation zone and e the methyl acetate produced and separated in the step a , c or d is supplied to the carbonylation step b . The process has advantages over the existing process for producing vinyl acetate from ethylene.
