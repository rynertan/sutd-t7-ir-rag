## Description
FOOD PRODUCT This invention relates to food products and more especially to processed food products containing a stabilising or thickening agent. Various processed food products such as ice cream, whipping cream, cheese spreads, cheese slices, milk drinks, meringues and the like when produced on a commercial scale normally incorporate a stabilising and or thickening agent to improve their processability, texture, organoleptic properties and storage capability. Various materials have been used as stabilising and thickening agents including carob gum and or cellulose ethers such as the hydroxyethyl and carboxymethyl ethers. Carob gum is now in short supply and is relatively expensive but for many applications is among the best stabilising and thickening agentshitherto available. This invention is based on the observation that glucomannans especially those derived from the Amorphophallus species and especially from A. rivieri and its varieties, often referred to as A. Nonjac, A. oncophyllus, A. vanabilis, A. bulbifera and A. blumeiicanbe used satisfactorily to replace carob gum or carob gum in admixture with other gums and thickeners as a stabilising and or thickening agent in processed food products such as those indicated above. Such glucomannans, especially that derived from A. konjac are in many cases cheaper than carob gum and frequently can be used in smalle quantities than carob gum to achieve the same effect or a better effect. The invention provides an ungelled processed food product preferably having a pH less than 8 such as, for example, a dairy product such as ice cream, whipping cream, cheese spread, cheese slices, a flavor milk drink or a meringue, a salad cream or mayonnaise, a gravy or sauce or a jam or pie filling etc., which has been stabilised and or thickened incorporation therein of at least one glucomannan, preferably a glucomannan derived from the Amorphopnallus sp. and especially a glucomannan derived from A. konjac, A. oncophyllus, A. variatjilis, A. blumeiiorA. bulbifera. The amount of glucomannan required to be incorporated in the food product depends, of course, on the effect to be achieved but normally amounts within the range of from 0.01 to 5 are found to be satisfactory. The following examples illustrate the invention. In the Examples two different forms of Konjac glucomannan were used the material referred to as Japanese Konjac is a purified glucomannan extract of approximately 90 by weight glucomannan content and is a commercially available product the material referred to as Chinese Taro is a crude material obtained by slicing, drying and grinding whole tubers of A. Konjac from a Chinese source to a particle size of 0.5 mm or less. The Chinese Taro material in addition to the glucomannan contains large amounts of starch and in the examples is used in an amount which is 56 more than is used with Japanese Konjac to ensure that the glucomannan content of the produced food products is the same. The word Genulacta is a Registered Trade Mark.Example 1 Ice Cream Some commercial Ice Creams use Carob gum for its stabilising and thickening powers. It imparts smooth melt down and heat shock resistance and is not affected by lactic acid or calcium salts. The Ice Cream was made to the recipe shown in Table 1.

The water 6,600 cc was raised to 50 C, milk powder added, then sugar, then butter hand sliced into 5 cm pieces, then GMS. Temperature was raised to 720C and held for 10 mins. The blend was transferred to stainless steel buckets and passed through a homogeniser to reduce fat globules to 1p. An APVGaulin Minor Homogeniser with 2 stage valve at 2000 psi used. The homogenised mix was transferred to the Taylor machine and beaten until cool. Vanilla was added and beating cooling continued to auto cutout at 5 C. Beating was then continued with manual overide and samples taken to estimate foaming. Beating was continued until the air content of each mix was approximately 50 . The ice cream was poured into plastic dishes and frozen in a blast freezer at 250C.

A taste panel unanimously agreed that recipe sample 1 was watery, with a less full textured mouth feel. The panel also found that samples 2 to 4 were all better than sample 1 with samples 3 and 4 exhibiting smoother melt down in the mouth and appearing less crystalline than sample 2. Example 2 whipping Cream Carob gum has also been used commercially to stabilise natural whipped cream. Co operative Wholesale Society Whipping Cream 48 Butter fat was used. The thickener was added to the cream and the mix was handwhipped with a kitchen tool to peaks . pint 276 g samples were used at room temperature 20 C .

Two teaspoons of caster sugar were beaten in and the remainder of the sugar was folded in. The mix was piped onto grease proof paper. Cooking time was 1 hours in a forced air oven at 1290C. After cooking, the meringue shells were left to stabilise and samples were evaluated after 24 hours.

The salts are called Joha Emulsifying agents. They consist of Sodium, Potassium and Calcium polyphosphates, diphosphates, monophosphates and citrates.

The addition of thickene,s reduces melt down effects when such processed cheese slices are subsequently used in cooking, for example, Welsh Rarebit. The cheeses from Example 4 were reheated with beating to lower the moisture content, and left to stiffen overnight in the refrigerator. Next day, slices were cut with an electric knife and equal weights placed on toast. All four samples were toasted simultaneously under a domestic gas oven grill. Sample 1 no gum melted quicker and ran over the sides of the bread. Samples 2, 3 and 4 all showed less tendency to overflow when molten. All four samples tasted equally pleasant.Example 6 Milk Drinks Japanese Konjac and Chinese Taro were added to a commercially available milk drink and left overnight in the refrigerator. The mix was then homogenised with the Silverson mixer highest shear . Viscosities were measured with the BrookfieldViscometer Model LVT .
