# Apparatus and method for continuously producing a strip of dough having substantially constant transverse dimensions and flow rate.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for continuously producing at a substantially constant flow rate a strip of dough of sub stantially constant dimensions, by controlling the speed of a feed conveyor 15 from which the dough is transferred to a constant speed conveyor 16 . Dough is weighed and fed at speeds inversely proportional to the weighed measurements, and the transferred dough is shaped by a cooperative action of two constant speed conveyors 16, 18 , width defining members 20, 22 , and a roller mechanism 24 to define the dimensions of the dough strip.
