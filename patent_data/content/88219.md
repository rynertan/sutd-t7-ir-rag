# Nipple for the feeding of nursing infants, or for stimulation of their buccal motions.

## Abstract
The nipple 1 affixed to a bottle of a nursing infant 2 by means of ring 3 comprises a semi rigid internal mem brane 5 which limits the chamber reservoir 11 . Said reservoir extends by means of a lactiferous duct which ends in an opening 9 normally closed by zone 8 of the thin elastic membrane 7 which covers internal membrane 5 . During suction, zone 8 of the membrane 7 swells as it becomes filled with liquid from the lactiferous duct, expel ling of the liquid into the mouth being then obtained by pinching of teat 8 between the lips, and the ejection of the liquid through opening 10 which then is uncovered.
