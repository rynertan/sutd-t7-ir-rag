# Method of producing silicon iron sheet material with annealing atmospheres of nitrogen and hydrogen.

## Abstract
The method of producing grain oriented silicon iron sheet comprising the steps of a providing fine grained, decarburized, and primary re crystallized silicon iron intermediate product sheet material, said material containing from 2.2 to 4.5 silicon, boron, man ganese up to 0.10 , said material having a manganese to sul fur ratio of at least 2.1 and not more than about 20 parts per mil lion solute nitrogen b covering said sheet with an electrically insulating bo ron containing adherent coating c heating said coated sheet in a first atmosphere com prising hydrogen and at least about 20 volume percent nitro gen to a first temper, e.g., of substantially 1050 C, developing thereby a cube on edge secondary recrystallization texture in said sheet and d increasing the temperature of said sheet to a second temperature, e.g., of substantially 1175 C, and holding said sheet at said second temperature in a second atmosphere consisting essentially of hydrogen for a predetermined time, e.g., of substantially three hours, effecting thereby substantial removal of carbon, sulfur and nitrogen.
