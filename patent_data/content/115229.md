## Description
A MOISTURE SEAL FOR AN ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR This invention relates to a moisture seal for an electrical connector assembly. Releasing electrical connector designs have heretofor been employed which produce separation of a plug connector from a mating receptacle connector upon application of a separating force. Some arrangements have included an operating sleeve mounted so that upon application of an external separating force the operating sleeve is axially shifted, which in turn produces a release of a retaining connection between the receptacle and plug. The retaining connection has included a camming arrangement, such as by threads engaging or by a bayonettype connection, wherein cam surfaces formed on a coupling member carried within the operating sleeve interact with cam surfaces formed on the receptacle to provide axial advancing movement of the receptacle into engagement with the plug by rotation of the operating sleeve and retention upon their achieving connected relationship. A releasing action is produced by a segmenting of the coupling member by provision of arcuate segments which blossom radially outward, such as shown in releasing Electrical Connector U.S. Patent 4,279,458 issuing July 21, 1981 to Waldron et al, or which pivot, such as shown in Coupling Devices U.S.Patent 3,538,485 issuing November 3, 1970 to Hennessey, upon axial movement of the operating sleeve rearwardly from a connecting first position to an axially retracted releasing second position induced by an external separating force acting between the receptacle and the operating sleeve. The separating force must act against compression springs which serve to constantly bias the operating sleeve into the connecting first position, the operating sleeve serving to confine the arcuate segments for connecting in the first position and, upon rearward movement, uncovering the segments to allow radial outward releasing movement of the segments. Once mated, an annular air gap exists between the operating sleeve and the arcuate segments and between adjacent sidewalls of the individual segments. Unless otherwise protected, these air gaps are subject to attack by air and moisture penetration. Should moisture be received in the threaded front portion of the releasing connector and or about the plug, electrical breakdown from moisture penetration is possible. Further, in many environments, such as where both moisture and cold temperatures prevail, ice has a tendency to form. A current but severe ice resistance test required by a United States military specification MIL C 38999H imposes a requirement that a connector operate at a 550C after being immersed in water.If moisture is received in and then freezes within any air gaps formed at the forward mating end, ice formation could present a severe problem in that releasability could be prevented and or increase the requisite amount of releasing force needed to break the arcuate segments free from the grip of frozen matter, a force which could be sufficient to break a releasing lanyard before release of the connectors is accomplished. The electrical connector art has provided resilient one piece elastic members for resisting moisture penetration. Provision of suitable undercuts to allow internal mounting of the elastic member could increase total connector package size and require costly machining.External mounting could require support surfaces on both connector members. Accordingly, a desirable electrical interconnection for connector bodies for use in moisture and ice prone environments would include a moisture sealing connecting arrangement that effectively prevents moisture from entering the mated forward portions of the connector bodies, that provides moisture sealing for one connector part and that easily adapts to presently available connectors. In accord with this invention a plug connector is adapted to mate with an externally threaded receptacle connector, an operating sleeve is mounted to the plug connector and biased into a non release position by a series of coil springs acting between the operating sleeve and the plug connector, a plurality of threaded arcuate segments are assembled within the operating sleeve and adapted to blossom radially outward by a camming action, and a moisture seal protects the mated connectors, the moisture seal characterized by each of the arcuate segments being comprised of a rigid material, the outer surface of each segment being formed with a radially outward extending tapered surface and the inner wall of the operating sleeve having a tapered surface to define a frusto conical portion which is adapted to uniformly contact the tapered surface of the arcuate segments when biased thereagainst by the coil springs whereby the segments are driven radially inward against one another. One advantage of this invention is provision of assembly with a coupling member including a selfcontained, metallic moisture sealing connecting device consisting of radially movable arcuate segments which both couples and seals forward portions of associated connector members together to establish a full mating relationship. An advantage of providing tapering frusto conical surfaces enhances axial centering and moisture sealing. One way of carrying out the invention is described below with reference to the drawings which illustrate one specific embodiment of this invention, in which FIGURE 1 is a longitudinal view, partially in section, of a moisture sealed electrical connector assembly according to the present invention. FIGURE 2 is an exploded perspective view of major components shown in the electrical connector depicted inFIGURE 1. FIGURE 3 shows the electrical connector assembly ofFIGURE 1 undergoing release. FIGURE 4 is a partial end view taken along linesIV IV of FIGURE 1. FIGURE 5 is a partial end view taken along lines V V of FIGURE 3. Referring now to the drawings and FIGURE 1 in particular, an electrical connector assembly 100 includes a first connector member 10 i.e. a receptacle having a forward mating end 12, a second connector member 20 i.e.a plug having a forward mating end 22 see FIGURE 2 , the forward mating end of the plug connector mating by telescopically interfitting the forward mating end of the receptacle, a coupling arrangement for releasably coupling the plug to the receptacle and a moisture seal preventing moisture from entering the mated forward mating ends of the connector members. Typically, although not shown, each connector member 10, 20 would include a dielectric insert and each respective insert would mount one or more pin and socket type contacts therein for completing an electrical interconnection therebetween. Alignment keys 23 seeFIGURE 2 on plug connector 20 are adapted to mate with corresponding keyways not shown on the receptacle connector 10 so as to properly align the plug within the receptacle for proper electrical contact engagement. The receptacle connector member 10 comprises a generally cylindrical shell with the forward mating end 12 thereof having thread 14 formed on its exterior. The plug connector member 20 comprises a generally cylindrical shell having the forward mating end 22, a rearward end 24, a radial flange 26 extending annularly and an annular groove 28 rearward of and circumjacent of radial flange 26. The coupling arrangement comprises a plurality of threaded arcuate coupling segments 30, a pair of spring retainer housings 40, the segments and housings being circumposed in tandem about the plug connector, an operating sleeve 50 concentric with and circumposed both around the coupling segments 30 and the spring retainer housings 40, a plurality of coil springs 42 and an abutment arrangement formed by a snap ring 45 and a retaining ring 44, each of the coupling segments 30 having a thread portion 32 thereon adapted to engage with the mating thread 14 on the receptacle 10 and an inward radial flange 36 adapted to be received within the annular groove 28, each spring retainer housing 40 having an exterior provided with an annular slot 41, a plurality of longitudinal slots 43 and a plurality of longitudinal grooves 47 having an end wall 49 and including an inward radial flange 46 adapted to be received in annular groove 28, operating sleeve 50 having an interior wall 52 provided with a plurality of longitudinal ribs 53 and a plurality of longitudinal grooves 57 having therein an inner end wall 59, the longitudinal ribs 53 being adapted to register with the longitudinal slots 43 and the sets of longitudinal grooves 47, 57 being adapted to register to form a cavity to receive one of the coil springs 42, the snap and retaining rings 45, 44 being received in annular slot 41 with the retaining ring 45 and the respective end walls 59 forming spaced seats for each spring 42 to seat against.Longitudinal ribs 53 extend radially inward from interior wall 52 of operating sleeve 50 and function to constrain the arcuate segments 30, the retainer housings 40 and the operating sleeve 50 to rotate as a unit during coupling advance of the plug. A lanyard 60 is secured to operating sleeve 50 to transmit external releasing forces to the mated assembly. Preferably and in accord with his invention, each arcuate segment 30 includes an exterior surface including an arcuate surface 34 and a radially outward tapered surface 36, a pair of spaced longitudinally extending side walls 35, 37 and a front face 39, each of the segments 30 being sized and adapted to assemble and form a closed cylinder for moisture sealing and to partially disassemble for uncoupling of the connector assembly. In the moisture sealed position shown, the side wall 35 of one arcuate segment is abutting the side wall 37 of the adjacent arcuate segment.Interior wall 52 of operating sleeve 50 is generally cylindrical and includes a frustoconical surface 54 radiating outwardly relative to the central axis of the operating sleeve to a transverse forward end face or rim 55, the cylindrical and frusto conical surfaces 52, 54 being configured respectively to abut against the cylindrical arcuate and outward tapered surfaces 34, 36 of the coupling segments, the springs 42 biasing the operating sleeve 50 forward whereby the operating sleeve drives each of the coupling segments 30 radially inward. Each arcuate segment 30 is comprised of a relatively rigid inelastic material e.g. metal and each includes on its inner surface a thread feature which forms continuous helical thread 32 when the segments are assem bled. When assembled, each of the segments have their adjacent respective sidewalls 35, 37 contacting. FIGURE 2 shows plug 20 and disassembly of the coupling arrangement. The plug connector forward mating end 22 includes alignment keys 23 and an end face 25. Six arcuate coupling segments 30 are provided and each coupling segment includes an indented sidewall 35a, 37a adjacent its radial flange 36, adjacent indented sidewalls of the respective segments when assembled interfitting and registering with ribs 53 on the operating sleeve. FIGURE 3 shows uncoupling release about to occur between plug and receptacle connectors 10, 20 as a result of an external longitudinal force F being applied to lanyard 60. The external force is transmitted to the thread 32, 14 whereby the coupling segments 30 are cammed radially outward upon rearward movement of operating sleeve 50, the release resulting by radial flange 36 moving radially outward from annular groove 28 relative to annular shoulder 26. Inner end wall 59 of the operating sleeve compresses the spring 42 rearwardly against the ring 45 such that upon release of external force F operating sleeve 50 is driven forward and the segments radially inward. FIGURE 4 shows an end view of the moisture sealed condition with the receptacle removed for clarity wherein the coupling segments 30 are assembled together and driven radially inward by operating sleeve 50 with the interior frusto conical wall 54 of the operating sleeve circumposing the tapered outer surface 34 of each arcuate segment. The tapered surfaces 34, 54 and adjacent side walls 35, 37 completely contact one another and, due to the springs 42 driving the surfaces together, cooperate to resist water entry. FIGURE 5 shows an end view of a releasing condition with the receptacle removed for clarity of the coupling arrangement and the disassembly which would result between the plug from the receptable. The arcuate segments 30 blossom radially outward with respective side walls 35, 37 of adjacent segments separating and outer surfaces 34 sliding outward relative to frusto conical surface 54. The mating tapered surfaces 34, 54 formed respectively on the arcuate segments 30 and operating sleeve 50 form an acute angle with respect to the primary axis of the assembly, an angle preferably in the range of 25 40 . Although providing mating surfaces 34, 54 with a steep angle e.g. greater than 450 relative to the primary axis would work, an acute angle in the range of between 25 40 offers a good balance of providing a sufficient surface contact area to resist moisture entry. A steep angle, although workable, would require that operating sleeve 50 have a relatively thick wall to provide the same area of surface contact. Further, each mating tapered surface would be formed at the same angle. The arcuate segments, when assembled circumferentially around plug connector 20, define a closed sleeve having the continuous mating tapered surface 34 and respective adjacent indented sidewalls 35a, 37a confronting, the closed sleeve being adapted to rotate and move radially outward relative to plug connector 20 respectively during coupling rotation and release and the indented sidewalls 35a, 37a receiving from operating sleeve 50 one longitudinal rib 53.Operating sleeve 50 is mounted around arcuate segments 30 for rotation therewith and axial movement thereto, the longitudinal ribs interfitting between the indented sidewalls and the springs 42 biasing mating tapered surface 54 forward during coupling.
