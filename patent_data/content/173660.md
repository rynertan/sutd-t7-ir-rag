# A method of detecting with the aid of x ray radiation heterogeneities in the insulation of pipe assemblies in district heating systems, and apparatus for carrying out the method.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for detecting with the aid of X ray radiation, caused to act upon a film or the like 5 , heterogeneities in joins located between mutually adjacent sections of insulation 4 on pipe assemblies in district heating systems, these pipe assemblies comprising an inner steel pipe 3 , insulation 4 , and a tubular jacket 2 . The novel features of the invention reside in bringing the radiation transmitted from an X ray radiation source 1 of low energy type, in at least two mutually sequential exposure stages to contact the steel pipe at at least one point thereon or along at least one tangential line T1, T2 and to pass through the insulation 4 along the whole of that part of the radius of the jacket 2 which lies between the contact point line and the inner defining surface 8 of the jacket and in that the axis 6 of the X ray radiation source 1 lies in a plane which is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the steel pipe.
