# Hydrophilized membrane of porous hydrophobic material and process for preparing the same.

## Abstract
A hydrophilized membrane of a porous hydrophobic material having micropores each defined by a surface at least part of which is coated with a hydrophilizing agent which is solid at about 20 C and substantially insoluble in water. The hydrophilizing agent is preferably selected from monofatty acid esters of propylene glycol. Also disclosed are processes for hydrophilizing such porous hydrophobic membranes.
