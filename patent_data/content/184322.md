## Description
The present invention relates to novel substituted benzimidazole derivatives, processes for their preparation, intermediates useful in their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy. Substituted benzimidazole derivatives that are capable of inhibiting gastric acid secretion are known in the art. For example, GB 1500043 and GB 1525958 disclose a series of 2 pyridylalkylthio and 2 pyridylalkylsulphinyl benzimidazoles in which the pyridyl group is optionally mono substituted by an alkyl or a halogen group. Further, EP 5129B, 74341A and 80602A disclose series of 2 pyridylalkylsulphinyl and 2 pyridylalkylthio benzimidazoles in which the pyridyl group is optionally substituted by 1 to 3 substituents selected from methyl, ethyl, methoxy, ethoxy, methoxyethoxy or ethoxyethoxy and GB 2134523A discloses further such compounds in which the pyridyl group is optionally substituted by 1 to 3 groups. Such compounds are believed to exert their effects by inhibition of the gastro intestinal H K ATPase enzyme Fellenius E., Berglindh, T., Sachs, G., Olke, L., Elander, B., Sjostrand, S.E. and Wallmark B., 1981, In addition, US 4359465 discloses the cytoprotective action of certain 2 pyridylalkylthio and 2 pyridylalkylsulphinyl benzimidazoles and their use in the treatment or prevention of gastro intestinal inflammatory disease. The compounds of the present invention are 2 pyridylalkylsulphinyl and 2 pyridylalkylthio benzimidazoles in which the 2 pyridyl group is substituted in the 4 position by an optionally substituted amino group, and are inhibitors of potassium stimulated H K ATPase activity. The present invention therefore provides, in a first aspect, a compound of structure I Suitably, R¹ to R⁴ are all hydrogen. Preferably R¹ and R⁴ are hydrogen, one of R² and R³ is hydrogen and the other is halogen, trifluoromethyl, C Suitably, ethoxy groups substituted by 3 to 5 fluorine atoms are, 2,2,2 trifluoroethoxy, 1,1,2 trifluoroethoxy, 1,2,2 trifluoroethoxy, 1,2,2,2 tetrafluoroethoxy and perfluoroethoxy. Preferably ethoxy groups substituted by 3 to 5 fluorine atoms are 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethoxy. Suitably, groups O CR₂ Suitably n is 0. Preferably n is 1. Suitably one of R⁵ and R⁶ is hydrogen and the other is C Suitably R⁵ and R⁶ together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form an azetidino group. Preferably, R⁵ and R⁶ together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form a morpholino, pyrrolidino, piperazino, N C Suitably R⁷ and R⁸ are both halogen. Preferably, one of R⁷ and R⁸ is halogen and the other is hydrogen or C C Preferably, C Preferably C Preferably C C Halogen groups are fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. Preferably halogen groups are chlorine or bromine. Preferred compounds of the present invention include Compounds of structure I in which n is 0, can form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts with suitable organic and inorganic acids, the nature of which will be apparent to persons skilled in the art. For example, pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be formed by reaction with hydrochloric, sulphuric, sulphonic or phosphonic acids aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic or heterocyclic carboxyl or sulphonic acids methionine, tryptophan, lysine or arginine and the like. Compounds of structure I in which n is 1 can also form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, but in aqueous solution the salts are less stable than those formed with the compounds of structure I in which n is 0. Compounds of structure I in which n is 1 can form basic salts by reaction with an appropriate base. Such salts include, for example, the sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium and magnesium salts which can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art for example, the sodium, potassium and lithium salts can be prepared by reaction with sodium, potassium or lithium hydroxide in an aqueous or non aqueous medium and the calcium salts can be prepared by reaction with calcium chloride in an aqueous or non aqueous medium. Compounds of structure I in which n is 0 can also form basic salts but such salts are less stable than those prepared from compounds of structure I in which n is 1. Compounds of structure I in which n is 1 have an asymmetric centre at the S atom and are thus optically active compounds. As such, these compounds exist as two optical isomers enantiomers . In addition, compounds of structure I in which one or more of R¹ to R⁸ is a branched C Both the pure enantiomers, racemic mixtures 50 of each enantiomer and unequal mixtures of the two are included within the scope of the present invention. Further, all diasteriomeric forms possible pure enantiomers and mixtures thereof are within the scope of the invention. It should be noted that for all the compounds of the present invention, the substituents R¹ and R⁴ as well as R² and R³ are considered to be equivalent at room temperature in solution. This is due to the tautomerism of the benzimidazole nucleus causing an equilibrium between the 2 possible forms. In a further aspect the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of structure I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof which comprises a reacting a compound of structure II b reacting a compound of structure IV c reacting a compound of structure VI d reacting a compound of structure VIII Suitable leaving groups L¹ displaceable by mercaptan include halogen, for example chloro, bromo or iodo, aryl sulphonyloxy for example toluenesulphonyloxy, alkylsulphonyloxy for example methanesulphonyloxy, alkylmercapto, for example methylmercapto, or alkylsulphinyl, for example methylsulphinyl.

Suitable protecting groups R⁹ are those conventional in the art for example as described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis T.W. Greene 1981 Wiley . It will be appreciated that the group R⁹ should not be cleavable under the conditions of reaction of compounds of structure VIII and IX . Such groups include for example benzyl or trityl groups. The reaction between compounds of structure II in which L¹ is SH and compounds of structure III in which L² is a leaving group can be carried out under basic conditions in the presence of an inert solvent at a temperature between ambient and the reflux temperature of the solvent. Suitable solvents include lower alkanols, for example methanol or ethanol, mixtures of lower alkanols with water, or ethers for example dimethoxyethane or tehrahydrofuran. Suitable bases will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include for example, alkali metal hydroxides, for example, sodium or potassium hydroxide, alkali metal alkoxides, for example potassium t butoxide, alkali metal hydrides, for example sodium or potassium hydride, or organic tertiary amines, for example triethylamine. Preferably the reaction is carried out at ambient temperature in ethanol as solvent, in the presence of sodium hydroxide solution. It is to be noted, and will be apparent to persons skilled in the art that under basic conditions L² should be a group other than hydroxy or acetoxy, for example halogen, preferably chlorine. Further, the reaction can be carried out under neutral conditions in the presence of an inert solvent at the reflux temperature of the solvent. Suitable solvents include those hereinbefore described. Alternatively, when L² is hydroxy or C The reaction between compounds of structure II in which L¹ is a leaving group and compounds of structure III in which L² is SH can be carried out under basic conditions as described for the reaction between compounds of structure II in which L¹ is SH and compounds of structure III in which L² is a leaving group. The reaction between compounds of structure IV and compounds of structure V can be carried out under acidic conditions in a suitable solvent at a temperature between ambient and reflux temperature of the solvent used. Suitably the reaction is carried out in polar solvents, for example, lower alkanols, dimethyl sulphoxide, acetone, dimethylformamide or acetonitrile, optionally in the presence of water. Preferably the reaction is carried out in ethanol. Suitably the reaction is carried out in the presence of a strong acid, for example hydrobromic or hydrochloric acid. Preferably the reaction is carried out in the presence of hydrochloric acid. Preferably the reaction is carried out at the reflux temperature of the solvent. The reaction between a compound of structure VI and a compound of structure VII can be carried out in an inert solvent at ambient or elevated temperature depending on the nature of groups M and Z. Suitable solvents include those solvents usually employed for the reaction of enolate ions with alkylating agents for example, benzene or toluene. Preferably, when M is lithium and Z is chlorine, the reaction is conducted in benzene at reflux temperature. The reaction between a compound of structure VIII and a compound of structure IX can be carried out under conditions normally used for organometallic reactions as will be well known to those skilled in the art. The products of reactions a to c are compounds of structure I in which n is 0. These products can be oxidised to compounds of structure I in which n is 1 by reaction with an oxidising agent. Suitable oxidising agents include, for example, nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide, peracids, peresters, ozone, dinitrogen tetroxide, iodosobenzene, N halosuccinamide, 1 chlorobenzotriazole, hypohalites, for example sodium hypochlorite or t butyl hypochlorite, diazabicylo 2,2,2 octane bromine complex, sodium metaperiodate, selenium dioxide, manganese dioxide, chromic acid, ceric ammonium nitrate, bromine, chlorine, or sulphuryl chloride. Preferably the oxidising agent is m chloroperbenzoic acid. The oxidation reaction is carried out under conditions known in the art for the oxidation of thiols to sulphoxides. Suitably, the reaction is carried out in an inert solvent at a temperature of between 70 and the boiling point of the solvent used. Suitable solvents include aromatic or chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene dichloromethane or chloroform, esters, for example ethyl acetate, or ethers, for example dioxan. Preferably, the reaction is carried out in dichloromethane at a temperature of between 50 and 20 C. The compounds of structure I are obtained either as the free base, or in the form of a salt depending on the choice of starting materials and reaction conditions. If the free compound is obtained it can be converted into a salt by standard techniques well known to those skilled in the art, for example by dissolving the compound in a suitable solvent and adding the desired acid or base alternatively, if a salt is obtained it can be converted into the free compound, again by standard techniques, for example by treatment with an appropriate acid or base. Racemic mixtures may be produced and can be separated by standard techniques e.g. recrystallisation from optically active solvent or by high performance liquid affinity chromatography as described by S. Allenmark, B. Bomgren, H. Baren and P O Lagerstrom in Analytical Biochemistry, The intermediate of structure IV and the intermediate benzimidazole structures II , VI and VIII are known and can be prepared by methods analogous to those known in the art. For example, compounds of structure II in which L¹ is SH can be prepared by reacting the corresponding compounds of structure IV with carbon disulphide in the presence if alkali metal hydroxides, or with potassium ethylxanthate Org. Syn., Compounds of structure VI can be prepared by methylation, oxidation and subsequent deprotection of compounds of structure II in which L¹ is SH using, for example, alkali metal hydroxides or alcoholates. The intermediates of structures III , V , VII and IX are novel and provide a further aspect of the invention. They can be prepared by methods analogous to those well known in the art as described in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds Pyridine and its Derivatives , Pts. 2 and 3, E. Klingsberg Ed., Interscience Publishers, 1962. For example, i compounds of structure III in which L² is hydroxy and R⁵ and R⁶ are not both hydrogen can be prepared by the reactions outlined in Scheme 1. In Scheme 1, the 3 or 5 halo compounds of structure X are known or can be prepared by standard methods. ii compounds of structure III in which L2 is hydroxy, R⁵ and R⁶ are not both hydrogen, one of R⁷ and R⁸ is bromine and the other is hydrogen or C Separation of the 3 and 5 bromo intermediates XVIII and XIX followed by oxidation to the corresponding N oxides and rearrangement using, for example, acetic anhydride gives the required compounds of structure III in which one of R⁷ and R⁸ is bromine and the other is hydrogen. If, in the starting material of structure XV one of R⁷ and R⁸ is C iii compounds of structure III in which L² is hydroxy, R⁵ and R⁶ are not both hydrogen, R⁷ is chlorine and R⁸ is hydrogen or C iv compounds of structure III in which L² is hydroxy and R⁵ and R⁶ are both hydrogen can be prepared by reduction of compounds of structure XII using for example Raney Nickel hydrazine, followed by rearrangement of the 4 amino N oxide intermediate so formed, with, for example acetic anhydride. Treatment of the compounds of structure III in which L² is OH with halogenating agents such as thionyl chloride or O acylating agents such as p toluenesulphonyl chloride gives the required compounds of structure III in which L² is halogen or sulphonyloxy respectively. Compounds of structure III in which L² is SH can be prepared from compounds of structure III in which L² is a leaving group for example halogen, by reaction with, for example, NaSH. Compounds of structure V can be prepared from the corresponding compounds of structure III for example, compounds of structure V in which X is CSCl can be prepared by reaction of a compound of structure III in which L² is SH with thiophosgene. Compounds of structure VII can be prepared by methods analogous to those described in Roszniki Chem., In a further aspect the present invention provides compounds of structure I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for use in therapy. The compounds of structure I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts inhibit exogenously and endogenously stimulated gastric acid secretion and are useful in the treatment of gastro intestinal diseases in mammals, in particular humans. Such diseases include, for example, gastric and duodenal ulcers, and Zollinger Ellison Syndrome. Further, the compounds of structure I can be used in the treatment of other disorders where a cytoprotective and or anti secretory effect is desirable for example in patients with gastritis, NSAID induced gastritis, gastric ulcers, acute upper intestinal bleeding, and in patients with a history of chronic and excessive alcohol consumption. It is believed that, after administration to mammals, compounds of structure I in which n is 0 exert their anti secretory and cytoprotective activities after conversion into compounds of structure I in which n is 1. Furthermore it is believed that compounds of structure I in which n is 1, after administration to mammals, exert their anti secretory activity after transformation under acid conditions into another chemically reactive species. Active species so generated from compounds of structure I are within the scope of the present invention. In therapeutic use, the compounds of the present invention are usually administered in a standard pharmaceutical composition. The present invention therefore provides in a further aspect pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of structure I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compounds of structure I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts which are active when given orally can be formulated as liquids, for example syrups, suspensions or emulsions, tablets, capsules and lozenges. A liquid formulation will generally consist of a suspension or solution of the compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt in a suitable liquid carrier s for example, ethanol, glycerine, non aqueous solvent, for example polyethylene glycol, oils, or water with a suspending agent, preservative, flavouring or colouring agent. A composition in the form of a tablet can be prepared using any suitable pharmaceutical carrier s routinely used for preparing solid formulations. Examples of such carriers include magnesium stearate, starch, lactose, sucrose and cellulose. A composition in the form of a capsule can be prepared using routine encapsulation procedures. For example, pellets containing the active ingredient can be prepared using standard carriers and then filled into a hard gelatin capsule alternatively, a dispersion or suspension can be prepared using any suitable pharmaceutical carrier s , for example aqueous gums, celluloses, silicates or oils and the dispersion or suspension then filled into a soft gelatin capsule. Compounds of structure I in which n is 1 are susceptible to decomposition in acid media, and thus tablets and capsules containing such compounds are preferably provided with an enteric coating to protect the compound from acid degradation in the stomach or capsules used which are inherently acid resistant. Alternatively, the enteric coating can be provided by coating pellets containing the active ingredient before filling them into the hard gelatin capsule. Suitable enteric coating materials are those well known in the art of pharmacy and include for example shellac or anionic film forming polymers such as cellulose acetate phthalate and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate and the like, optionally in the presence of a plasticizer. Typical parenteral compositions consist of a solution or suspension of the compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt in a sterile aqueous carrier or parenterally acceptable oil, for example polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, lecithin, arachis oil or sesame oil. Alternatively, the solution can be lyophilised and then reconstituted with a suitable solvent just prior to administration. A typical suppository formulation comprises a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof which is active when administered in this way, with a binding and or lubricating agent such as polymeric glycols, gelatins or cocoa butter or other low melting vegetable or synthetic waxes or fats. Preferably the composition is in unit dose form such as a tablet or capsule. Each dosage unit for oral administration contains preferably from 1 to 250 mg and for parenteral administration contains preferably from 0.1 to 25 mg of a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof calculated as the free acid. The present invention also provides a method of inhibiting gastric acid secretion which comprises administering to a mammal in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The pharmaceutically acceptable compounds of the invention will normally be administered to a subject for the treatment of gastro intestinal diseases and other conditions caused or exacerbated by gastric acidity. The daily dosage regimen for an adult patient may be, for example, an oral dose of between 1 mg and 500 mg, preferably between 1 mg and 250 mg, or an intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular dose of between 0.1 mg and 100 mg, preferably between 0.1 mg and 25 mg, of the compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof calculated as the free base, the compound being administered 1 to 4 times per day. Suitably the compounds will be administered for a period of continuous therapy, for example for a week or more. In addition, the compounds of the present invention can be co administered with further active ingredients, such as antacids for example magnesium carbonate or hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide , non steroidal anti flammatory drugs for example indomethacin, aspirin or naproxen , steroids, or nitrite scavengers for example ascorbic acid or aminosulphonic acid , or other drugs used for treating gastric ulcers for example pirenzipine, prostanoids for example 16,16 dimethyl PGE₂, or histamine H₂ antagonists for example, cimetidine .

The compounds of Examples 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26 were all found to inhibit potassium stimulated ATPase activity in the above preparations at pH 6.1 and 7.4. The effect of a single concentration 100µm of a compound of structure I on dibutyryl cAMP stimulated AP metabolism in rabbit intact gastric glands was determined. Preferred compounds of structure I were tested over a range of concentrations to determine the IC₅₀ value. Intact gastric glands were prepared from New Zealand white rabbits by the method of Berghindh et al. Acta. Physio. Scand. 96, 150, 1976 . Gastric mucosal scrapings were digested at 37 C for 45 60 min. with Collagenase 100 U, Type 1, Sigma , and glands harvested by coarse filtration and sedimentation. Test compound was incubated with glands and 300 µM dibutyryl cAMP for 30 minutes at 37 C. Incubating medium contained 132.5 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.0 mM NaH₂PO₄, 5.0 mM Na₂HPO₄, 1.2 mM MgSO₄, 1.0 mM CaCl₂, 11.1 mM glucose, 2.0 mg ml rabbit albumin, 10µg ml phenol red, approximately 0.3 µM ¹⁴C aminopyrine 110 mCi mmole , pH 7.4. After incubation, glands were centrifuged and the supernatant removed. The glands were dried, weighed and dissolved in NaOH. The distribution of radioactivity between the supernatant and glands is then used to calculate the AP ratio after the method of Berglindh et al. Acta. Physiol. Scand. The IC₅₀ value is the amount of compound required to inhibit the histamine stimulated accumulation of aminopyrine by 50 . Using a modification of the procedure described by Ghosh and Schild Br. J. Pharmacology, No overt signs of toxicity were observed in any of the foregoing tests.
