# Active zeolite catalysts of improved stability.

## Abstract
A zeolite of improved stability for use in acid catalyzed reactions is prepared by midly presteaming the catalyst un der controlled conditions of temperature, time, and steam partial pressure. The resulting catalyst retains nearly the same activity as that of a fresh unsteamed catalyst.
