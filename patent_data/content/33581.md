# Catalysts and methods for forming isocyanurate products, compositions of said products, and urethane prepolymers and polyurethanes formed from said products.

## Abstract
Potassium salt of 2 pyrrolidinone is used as a catalyst to cyclotrimerize an organic diisocyanate, yielding a mixture of monomeric cyclotrimerized product isocyanurate and oligomers thereof, soluble in common organic solvents and vinyl monomers. The catalyst can be used to make one shot isocyanurate crosslinked polyurethanes. Prepolymers and moisture curing coating compositions can also be prepared.
