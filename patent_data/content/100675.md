# Document sheet feeding and registration apparatus and method.

## Abstract
A document sheet feeding and registration apparatus and method is described for deskewing and registering a document sheet 7 relative to a registered copying position on a copier platen 3 by feeding it against a sheet aligning document registration stop 18 . Initially the document sheet is fed towards the registration stop 18 with a first document sheet feeder 17 exemplified by a widely transversely spaced pair of high friction sheet feeding rollers, which resist skewing of the document sheet. Then the first document sheet feeder 17 is removed from the document sheet 7 after its lead edge is engaged by a second document sheet feeder 16 and before the document sheet 7 engages the registration edge stop 18 so that final skewing control of the document sheet is only by the second document sheet feeder 16 . The second document sheet feeder 16 is a single sheet feeding roller positioned centrally of the docu ment sheet lead edge area and positioned closely adjacent the registration edge 18 . This single roller provides a brief low rotational resistance deskewing of the document sheet 7 while driving the document sheet into final alignment with the registration stop 18 . All of the sheet feeding rollers are positioned over the document on the platen extending through a backing plate 27 so as to be hidden during copying.
