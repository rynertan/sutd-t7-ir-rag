## Description
COMPOSITION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This applicaticn is a Continuation in Part of Co pending application Serial No. 343,941, filed 1 29 82. Polycarbonates comprise a family of engineer thermoplastics that may be utilized for diverse applica tions. then polycarbonates are molded into complex shapes, it is usually necessary to er.ploy high temperatures to obtain the proper melt flow to ensure the compiete filling of the mold. The use of high tempera tures, i.e. above about 350 C, is undesirable because certain materials that are employed with polycarbonates are not stable at high temperatures. The applicant has discovered that the use of a multiphase composite interpolymer of an acrylate and a methacrylate a copolymer which comprises acrylonitrile, butadiene and an alkenyl aromatic compound and a Co polymer of an olefin and an acrylate with a major amount of z polycarbonate will result in a molding composition having good processability as evidenced by a high melt flow index. By selection of certain compositions embraced by the invention, it is possible to obtain polycarbonate molding compositions which significantly retain their impact strength and possess good compatibility as measured by weld line strength but have a re duced melt viscosity and are readily processable at lower temperatures.These compositicns are especially advantageous for use in molding complex shapes or detailed designs. In U.S.P. 3,130,177, compositions that consist of a polycarbonate and an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ABS copolymer are described. West German Patent 1,109,884 describes compositions of a polycarbonate with styrene acrylonitrile styrene resins. U.S.P. 3,880,783 describes transparent compositions of a particular group of polycarbonates that may include ABS polymers. An tionally, a composition of a major amount of a polycarbonate, a multiphase composite interpolymer of an acry late and a methacrylate, and a copolymer of an olefin and an acrylate has been on sale for more than a year and is claimed in U.S.P. 4,260,693, issued April 7, 1981. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The compositions of the invention are thermoplastic molding compositions which comprise a a major quantity of high molecular weight aromatic polycarbonate resin b a multiphase composite interpolymer which com pries a C1 5 acrylate and a C15 methacrylate c a ccpolymer of acrylonitrile, butadiene and an alkyl aromatic compound and i a copolymer of a C25 olefin and a C15 acrylate. The quantities of b , c and d are such that a high melt flow index is obtained. Specific compositions will have quantities of b , c and d such that impact strength of the composi tio is in thick section, compatibility as measured by double gate impact strength, and the melt flow index all remain high These preferred results are obtained by utilizing, in particular, appropriate quantities of the acrylonitrile, the butadiene and the alkenyl aromatic moieties of c . This relationship will be demonstrated in the data of this specification. The polycarbonate resin may be of the formula EMI2.1 wherein A is a divalent aromatic radical of a dibyaric phenol. Preferred polycarbonate resins are of the formula EMI3.1 wherein R1 and R2 are hydrogen, lower alkyl or phenyl and n is at least 30 or preferably between 40 and 400. The term lower alkyl includes alkyl groups of from 1 6 carbon atoms. High molecular weight, thermoplastic, aromatic polycarbonates in the sense of the present invention are to be understood as homopolycarbonates and copolycarbon ates and mixtures thereof which have a number average molecular weight of about 8,000 to more than 200,000, preferably of about 10,000 to 8G,000 and I.V. of 0.30 to 1.0 dl g as measured in methylene chloride at 25 C. These polycarbonates are derived from dihydric phenols such as, for example, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, bis 4 hydroxpenyl methane, 2, 2 bis 4 hydroxy 3 methylphenyl propane, 4,4 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl heptane, 2,2 3,5,3 5 tetrachloro 4,4 dihydroxyphenyl propane, 2,2 3,5,3 5 tetrabromo 4 4 dihydroxyaiphenyl propane, and 3,3 dichloro 4,41 dihydroxyphenyl methane. Other dihydric phenols which are also suitable for use in the preparation of the above polycarbonates are disclosed inU.S. Patent Nos. 2,999,835 3,028,365 3,334,154 and 4,131,575. These aromatic polycarbonates can be manufactured by known processes, such as, for example, by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor such as phosgene in accordance with methods set forth in the abovecited literature and U.S. Patent Nos. 4,018,750 and 4,123,436, or by transesterification processes such as are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,153,436, as well as other processes known to those skilled in the art. The aromatic polycarbonates utilized in the present invention also include the polymeric derivatives of a dihydric phenol, a dicarboxylic acid, and carbonic acid, such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,169,121. It is also possible to employ two or more different dihydric phenols or a copolymer of a dihydric phenol with a glycol or acid terminated polyester, or with a dibasic acid in the event a carbonate copolymer or interpolymer rather than a homopolymer is desired for use in the preparation of the aromatic polycarbonate utilized in the practice of this invention. Also employed in the practice of this invention can be blends of an of the above materials to provide the aromatic polycarbonate. Branched polycarbonates, such as are described in U.S. . 4,001,184, can be utilized in the practice of this invention, as can blends of a linear polycarbonate and a branched polycarbonate. The multiphase composite interpolymers which coprise a C15 acrylate and a C15 methacrylate are described in U.S.P. 4,260,693 and in U.S.P. 4,096,202 bo, of which are inccrporated by reference. These interpolymers consist of about 25 to 95 weight percent cf a first elastomeric phase polymerized from a monomer system comprising about 75 to 99.8 percent by weight of a C15 alkyl acrylate, 0.1 to 5 percent by weight crosslinking monomer, and 0.1 to 5 percent by weight of graftlinking mcnomer, and about 75 to 5 weight percent of a final rigid thermoplastic phase polymerized in the presence of said elastomeric phase. The crosslinking monomer is a polyethylenically unsaturated monomer having a plurality of addition poly meriz2b e react x e groups all of which polymerize at substantially the same rate of reaction. Suitable crosslinking monomers include poly acrylic and poly methacrylic esters of polyols such as butylene diacrylate and dimethacrylate, trimethylol propane trimethacrylate, and the like di and trivinyl benzene, vinyl acrylate and methacrylate, and the like. The preferred crossl nking monomer is butylene diacrylate. The graftlinking monomer is a polyethylenically unsaturated monomer having a plurality of addition poly merizabl reactive groups, at least one of which poly meriting at substantially different rates of polymeriza ticn from at least one other of said reactive groups.The function cf the graftlinking monomer is to provide a residual level of unsaturation in the elastomeric phase, particularly in the latter stages of polymerization and, consequently, at or ear the surface of the elastomer particles. When the rigid thermoplastic phase is subsequently polymerized at the surface of the elastomer, the residual unsaturated audition Dolymerizable reactive group contributed by the graftlinking monomer participates in the subsequent reaction so that at least a portion of the rigid phase is Chemically attached to surface of the elastomer. Among the effective graftlinking monomers are alkyl group containing monomers of alkyl esters of ethylenically unsaturated acids such as allyl acrylate, allyl methacrylate, diallyl maleate, diallyl fumarate, diallyl itaconate, allyl acid maleate, allyl acid fumarate, and allyl acid itaconate. Somewhat less preferred are the diallyl esters of polycarboxylic acids which do not contain polymerizable unsaturation.The preferred graft linking monomers are allyl methacrylate and diallyl maleate. A most preferred interpolymer has only two stages, the first stage comprising about 60 to 95 percent by weight of the interpolymer and being polymerized from a monomer system comprising 95 to 99.8 percent by weight butyl acrylate, 0.1 to 2.5 percent by weight butylene diacrylate as crosslinking agent, 0.1 to 2.5 percent by weight ally itethacrylate or diallyl maleate as a graft linking agent, with a final stage polymerized from about 60 to 10C percent by weight methyl methacrylate. The acrylonitrile butadiene alkenyl aromatic com pound copolymers are well known. The preferred copolymers are made from acrylonitrile butadiene sytrene and acrylonitrile butadiene alpha methyl styrene. Also use ful are acrylonitrile butadiene styrene wherein the phenyl group is substituted by alkyl groups, preferably p alkyl styrene and more preferably wherein the alkyl group is methyl. The acrylonitrile butadiene styrene resins are available commercially. The weight percents of the preferred acrylonitrile butadiene alkenyl aromatic con pound copolymers are from about 15 30 20 40 30 65, respectively and more preferably about 17 25 22 38 37 61, respectively. The copolymer of an olefin and an acrylate is a copolymer of a C2 5 olefin and 3 C15 acrylate that may be employed in the practice of the invention is a copolymer of an olefin such as ethylene, propylene, isobutylene, pentene and the like. The C2 5 acrylate may be an acrylate such as ethyl acrylate n butyl acrylate 1,3 butylene diacrylate methyl acrylate 1,4 butanediol diacrylate and isobutl acrylate. The acrylate portion of the olefin acrylate copolymer based on the total weight of the copolymer, can range from about 10 to about 30 weight percent. The olefin portion can range from about 70 to about 90 weight percent. The preferred olefin acrylate copolymer is an ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymer, in which the weight ratio 0 the ethylene fraction to tha ethyl acry late fraction is about 4.5 to 1. These olefin acrylate copolymers are commercially available or may be prepared by methods that are well known to those who are skilled in the art. Generally, the compositions of the invention will comprise about 55 to 95 parts by weight and more preferably from about 80 to 95 parts by weight of a polycarbonate, from about 2 to 35 parts and more preferably from about 4 to 12 parts by weight of a copolymer of an acrylonitrile butadiene alkenyl aromatic compound, from about 0.5 to 15 parts by weight and more preferably from about 1 to 12 parts by weight of the multiphase composite interpolymer which comprises a C15 acrylate and a C15 methacrylate and from about 0.5 to 10 parts by weight and more preferably from about 1 to 5 parts by weight of a copolymer of a C25 olefin and a C15 acrylate.All parts by weight are per 100 parts of the sum of the polycarbonate acrylonitrile butadiene alkenyl aromatic copolymer, multiphase com posite interpolymer and olefin acrylate copolymer in the composition. The compositions of the invention may include rein forcing fillers, such as aluminum, iron or nickel and the like and nonmetals, such as carbon filaments, silicates, such as acicular calcium silicate, acicular calcium sulfate, wollastonite, asbestos, titanium dioxide, bentonite, kaolinite potassium titanate and titanate whiskers, glass flakes and fibers and mixtures thereof.It is also to be understood that, unless the filler adds to the strength and stiffness of the composition, it is only a filler and not a reinforcing filler, as contemplated herein. In particular, the reinforcing fillers increase the flexural strength, the flexural modulus, the tensile strength and the heat distortion tempera ture. Although it is only necessary to have at last a reinforcing amount of the reinforcement present, in general, the reinforcing filler may comprise from about to about 60 parts by weight of the total composition. In particular, the preferred reinforcing fillers are of glass, and it is preferred to use fibrous glass filaments comprised of lime aluminium borosilicate glass that is relatively soda free. This is known as E lass, however, other glasses are useful where electrical properties are not so important, e.g., the low soda glass known as C glass. The filaments are made by standard processes, e.g., by steam or air blowing, flame blowing and mechanical pulling. The preferred filaments for rein forcemeat are made by mechanical puiling. The filament ciameters range from about 0.003 to 0.009 inch, but this is not critical to the present invention. By class fibers, it is understood that glass silk, as weil as all class fiber materials derived therefrom including glass fiber fabrics, roving, stable fibers and glass fiber mats are included. The length of the glass filaments and whether or not the are bundled into fibers and the fibers bundled in tur to yarns, ropes or rovinSs, or woven into mats, and the like, are also not critical to the invention. However, when using fibrous glass filaments, they may first be formed and gathered into a bundle known as a strand. in order to bind the filaments into a strand so that the strand can be handled, a binder or binding agent is applied to the glass filaments. Subsequently, the strand can be chopped into various lengths as desired. It is convenient to use the strands in lengths of from about 1 8 to about 1 long, preferably less than 1 4 in length. These are called chopped strands. Some of these binding agents are poly mers such as pclyvinyl acetate, particular polyester resins, polycarbonates, starch, acrylic melamine or polyvinyl alcohol. Preferably, the composition contains from about 1 to about 50 weight percent of the glass fibers. Flame reterdant amounts of flame retardants may also be utilized in the composition of the invention in amounts of from 0.5 50 parts by weight of the resinous components. Examples of suitable flame retardants mav be found in U.S. 3,935,400 and 3,940,366 which are in incorporated by reference. Other conventional nonreinforcing fillers, antioxidants, extrusion aids, light stabilizers, foaming agents such as those disclosed inU.S. 4,263,409 and Ger. Offen. 2,400,086 which are incorpora ted by reference and the like may be added to the composition cf the invention if desired. The manner of preparing the inventive composition is conventional. Preferably, each ingredient is added as part of a blend premix and th latter is mixed, e.g., by passage through an extuder, or by fluxing on a rill at a temperature dependent on the particular compcsi tion. The mixed composition may be cooled and cut up into molding granules and molded into the desired shape.

As shown by the data, a high melt flow index can be obtained in the non preferred area of the com, osition parameters. However, impact resistance is significantly impaired and compatibility of the compositions is not high in either instance. The effect that the olefin acrylate component has on melt flow is demonstrated by this data. Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in the light of the above teachings. It is, therefore, to be understood that changes may be made in the particular embodiment of the invention described which are within the full intended scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
