# Radiation image recording and read out apparatus.

## Abstract
A radiation image recording and read out apparatus comprises an image recording section 5 for recording a radiation image of an object 11 on a stimulable phosphor sheet 2 , an image read out section 6 for scanning the stimulable phosphor sheet by stimulating rays 61 and for detecting the light emitted thereby upon stimulation, and an erasing section 7 for releasing the radiation energy remain ing in the stimulable phosphor sheet. The stimulable phos phor sheets are circulated through these sections by con veyor belts and reused for image recording. Erasing condi tions at the erasing section are adjusted so that the stimulable phosphor sheet is conveyed out of the erasing section at time intervals approximately equal to the image read out time at the image read out section.
