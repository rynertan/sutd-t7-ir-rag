It has been found that imidazole dicarboxylic acid derivatives represented by the following general formula EMI2.1 have an antibiotic activity especially an anibiotic activity to Pseudomonas aeruqinosa and can be used as antibiotic substances see Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Specification No. 76887 80 . In the above general formula, X stands for a hydrogen atom, a substituent such as a halogen atom, a hydroxyl group, an alkyloxy group, an aralkyloxy group, an aryloxy group, a mercapto group, an alkylthio group, an aralkylthio group, an arylthio group, an alkylsulfonyl group, an aralkylsulfonyl group, an arylsulfonyl group, an alkylsulfinyl group, aralkylsulfinyl group, an arylsulfinyl group, an amino group, a mono or di alkylamino group, a mono or an acylamino group such as di aralkylamino group, a mono or di arylamino group , an acetylaminogroup, a sulfonic acid group or a nitro group, or an organic residue such as an alkyl group, an aralkyl group, an aryl group or a heterocyclic group, and R stands for a hydrogen atom or an organic residue such as an alkyl group, an aralkyl group, an aryl group or a heterocyclic group, with the proviso that all of the foregoing alkyl, aralkyl, aryl and heterocyclic groups may have a substituent. The amino acid constituting the imidazole dicarboxylic acid derivative of the present invention, that is, theR containing amino acid in the above general formula is, for example, phenyl glycine or 4 hydroxyphenylglycine, and any of L , D and DL isomers may be used. From. ehe viewpoint of the antibiotic action, D isomers are often preferred. Synthesis of the compounds represented by the above general formula can be accomplished by reacting a compound represented by the following general formula EMI3.1 with a compound having the following formula EMI3.2 In the above general formula, R stands for an alkyl group such as a methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl group, andX and R are as defined above. Introduction of the pyridinium group as in the above reaction is often accomplished by carrying out the reaction in an aqueous solution in the presence of potassium iodide, potassium thiocyanate or sodium iodide see, for example,Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Specification No.76887 80 . In such reaction conducted in an aqueous solution, ecomposition of the starting compound is caused and therefore, the yield is low. We made researches with a view to eliminating such defect and found that when the above reaction is carried out in formamide, the intended compound can be obtained in a hioh yield.

According to the present invention using formamide as the reaction solvent, there can be attained a higher yield than the yield attainably by the conventional process in which the reaction is carried out in an aqueous solution.Furthermore, the present invention is advantageous in that the amount of sodium iodide or the like used as the catalyst can be reduced. The reaction is preferably accomplished by adding 4 pyridine ethane sulfonic acid to a solution obtained by dis V solving an isolated compound of the following general formula EMI5.1 to in formamide,or a formamide solution of a compound of the above general formula synthesized in formamide according to the process disclosed in Japanese Patent Application LaidOpen Specification No. 129287 80, adding a necessary amount of a base or a catalyst such as sodium iodide according to need and heating the mixture with stirring. When the reaction is carried out by using alkali metal salts of the compound of the above general formula and 4pyridineethanesulfonic acid, a base need not be added. As the base for the reaction, there are preferably used tertiary amines such as triethylamine and diazobicyclononene and inorganic bases such as sodium hydrogencarbonate, sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. Preferred reaction conditions are as follows the amount of the base used is 1 to 5 equivalents, the amount of the catalyst is 10 to 40 equivalents, the amount of 4 pyridine ethanevsulfonic acid is 1 to 4 equivalents, the reaction temperature is 65 to 950C, and the reaction time is 1 to 5 hours.
