# A process for the isomerization of hexafluoropropylene oxide to hexafluoroacetone.

## Abstract
A continuous process for the isomerization of hexa fluoropropylene oxide to hexafluoroacetone comprises passing hexafluoropropylene oxide in contact with li quid antimony pentafluoride adsorbed on a solid support under conditions which substantially prevent loss of antimony pentafluoride from the reactor 1 in which the isomerization is carried out and removing the hexa fluoroacetone product at about the same rate as that at which it is formed. Hexafluoroacetone is an important industrial monomer, which can be copolymerized, for example, with ethylene and tetrafluoroethylene to a product that finds use in coating electrical wires.
