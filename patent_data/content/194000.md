# Improvements in regenerative heating systems.

## Abstract
A regenerative heating system comprises two heat re generators 1 and 2 of the type which are operable so that while one is being heated by waste gas the other is heating air for the combustion of fuel. The regenerators 1 and 2 communicate with each other adjacent one end to form a chamber 11 into which fuel gas is injected by means of a fuel pipe 3. The waste gas enters its respective regenerator by way of end 8 and passes through the bed 5 of the regenerator which stores the heat. Air travelling in the opposite direction is heated in the bed 5 and entrains the fuel gas. The steps 12 provide a venturi or choke effect on the air causing the pressure in the regenerator heating air to be lower than that in the regenerator being heated by waste gas. Fuel gas is thereby drawn into the air stream for admixture therewith and ignition for combustion by means of a pilot light 14.
