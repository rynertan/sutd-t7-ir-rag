# Process for preparing an integral Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell culture.

## Abstract
A process for preparing an integral Saccharomyces Cerevisiae cell culture containing the cell bodies and all the products which form during the cell multiplication process, and for stabilising the resultant product in order to maintain the cell integrity and biological activity unaltered for a long period. The product obtained is useful in human and animal feeding as a growth factor and regulator of bacterial and enzymatic imbalance of the intestine, and as a protein additive in the cosmetics industry.
