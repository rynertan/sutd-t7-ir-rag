# TRANSMISSION LINE SUSPENSION ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A rigid compression strut 18 extends generally horizon tally between a pair of spaced primary support points 20, 22 of V masts 34. A flexible tension member 24 is suspended below the compression strut 18 and has its opposing ends connected at 20 and 22 to apply compression forces lengthwise of the strut. An array of insulators 28, 30, 46 is disposed below the flexible tension member for supporting a plurality of electrical conductors 40, 42, 44 in a preselected pattern relative to one another. The insulators 30 are connected to the tension member 24 so that the latter bears a portion of the total loading imposed by the conductors.
