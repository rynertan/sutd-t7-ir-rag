# Hall element device.

## Abstract
A Hall element device comprising a plurality of Hall elements H1, H2 including a first and last Hall element, each of the Hall elements including a first input CT11, CT21 , a second input CT12, CT22 , a first output OT11, OT21 and a second output OT12, OT22 a control current circuit I1, I2 , electrically connected to each of the first input, for driving each of the Hall element and a circuit OA , electrically connected between adjacent Hall elements, for maintaining the second output of the one adjacent Hall element and the first output of the other adjacent Hall ele ment at the same potential and for preventing current from passing across the adjacent Hall elements, the circuit in cluding a first input electrically connected to the second output of the one adjacent Hall element, a second input electrically connected to the first input of the other adjacent Hall element, and an output electrically connected to the second input of the other adjacent Hall element, whereby the voltage across the first output of the first Hall element and the second output of the last Hall element represents the sum of, or the difference between the voltages across all of the adjacent Hall elements.
