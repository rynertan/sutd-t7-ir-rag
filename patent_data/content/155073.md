# CONTROLLABLE PITCH FANS

## Abstract
The pitch of the blades 22 of a fan is adjusted by a pneumatic piston and cylinder combination 48, 50 which rotates with the hub 20 of the fan. The cylinder element 50 is reciprocable axially with respect to the hub and is connected to the blades by a cam groove 92 in the cylinder element, and a plurality of cam followers 98 engaged in the groove for translating axial movement of the cylinder in one or other direction into pivotal movement of the blades to adjust the pitch of the blades. Pneumatic pressure is applied to the piston and cylinder combination to reciprocate the cylinder element 50 via a rotary union 82 which accommodates rotation of the combination.
