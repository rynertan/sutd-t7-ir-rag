# Amide imide derivatives of homopolymers of itaconic anhydride having antitumor activity.

## Abstract
Low molecular weight homopolymers of itaconic anhyd ride having average molecular weights of from about 400 to about 5000 and derivatized to contain a half amide, half carboxyl acid groups and b imide groups in which said imide groups comprise from about 3 by weight to about 35 by weight of said derivatized groups, and the phar maceutically acceptable cationic salt derivatives of said derivatized homopolymers, have antitumor activity.
