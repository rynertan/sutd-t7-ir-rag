## Abstract
A connector assembly including a strain relief member 40 comprising a sleeve form body 41 from respective opposite sides of which a cable tie 42 and a latching arm 43 extend in opposite axial directions. The sleeve form body 41 is adapted to be snap fitted on the wire receiving face 23 min of one connector 12 min and the latching arm 43 directly engages an abutment 31 moulded on a mating connector 11 min both to latch the connectors 11 min , 12 min assembled together and provide strain relief. The connector housings 11 min , 12 min may be a simple modification of existing housings 11, 12 possibly avoiding retooling changes by modification of the original mould.
