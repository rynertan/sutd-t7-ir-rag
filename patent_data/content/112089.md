# An air fuel induction system for a multi cylinder internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A motor vehicle LPG fuel system includes a pair of digital injection valves in a body 23 having a common inlet 17 , a common outlet 18 and an outlet chamber into which the gaseous LPG is injected alternately by the two valves. The metered pulsed outputs of the two valves collected in the outlet chamber is conveyed as a single gaseous fuel supply to the carburetter induction passage 10 . The injection valves can be located spaced from the carburetter 11 whereby to avoid excessive heating. An electronic control unit 19 including a microprocessor and a data store matrix responds to certain engine operating conditions, including engine speed and engine loading, and controls alternate operation of the valves in synchronism with the engine ignition firing sequence. Under certain conditions one of the valves may open before the other closes.
