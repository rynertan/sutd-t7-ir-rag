# Electrical connector provided with an ejector for disengaging the connector.

## Abstract
An electrical connector 10 for attaching an electrical cord 12 to an electrical appliance 11 is provided. The connector 10 has an ejector 21 which allows for one hand disengagement of the connector 10 and cord 12 from the appliance 11 . The ejector 21 has a first portion movable through and out of the connector 10 and an integral hinge shaped second portion. By application of finger pressure on the second portion to flatten it, the first portion is moved out of the connector 10 and against the appliance 11 causing an oppositely directed movement of the connector 10 thereby disengaging the connector 10 and cord 12 from the appliance 11 .
