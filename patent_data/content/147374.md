## Description
A METHOD FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF A CEMENT CONTi COMPOSITION HAVING IMPROVED PROPERTIES The present invention refers to a method for the manufacture of a cement zontaining composition, such as concrete and mortar, having good fluidity and an appropriate air content. These properties are obtained by adding an alkylene oxide adduct containing nitrogen. In cement containing compositions, such as concrete, today mainly three different types of additives improving the fluidity are used, viz. ligno sulphonate, naphtalene sulphonic acid formaldehyde condensate and sulphonated melamine formaldehyde condensates. These additives are anionic polymers and act by so called electrostatic stabilization.The advantages of the flowability improving additives can be summarized as follows a The cement containing composition can be made easily workable and pumpable at low water cement ratios.b The cement containing composition can be manufactured with less mixing water and with the same consistency as a cement containing composition without fluidity improving additives. The composition will hereby be stronger, i.e. the strength is increased.c The cement containing composition can be made more inexpensive by the fact that the contents of both cement and water can be reduced while still obtaining the de sired strength. However, the anionic additives have some serious drawbacks. Thus, the duration of the electrostatic stabilization is relatively short. Already during the first hour after the admixture the consistency is strongly decreased and the composition cannot be used in the intended way. The fluidity is further strongly temperature dependent causing difficulties at varying temperatures. Finally, the fluidizing additives have to be completed by so called air entraining agents in order to increase the air content in the concrete and thus obtain a frost resistent composition. The air entraining agent is further often very difficult to combine with the fluidizing additive. It has further been proposed to add different types of nonionic alkylene oxide adducts to a cement containing composition. See e.g. the German printed publication 1003640 and the European patent application 54175. The nonionic alkylene oxide adducts achieve their fluidizing effect by so called steric stabilization. . The positive effect on the fluidity of the concrete is high, but these additives also cause a too high air content causing severe deterioration of the strength of the cementitious composition. Thus, there is a need for additives to a cement containing composition, which especially during the first hour after the admixture of the composition provides a stable fluidizing effect as well as an appropriate air content. It has now proved possible to obtain a cement containing composition with good fluidity during the first hour after the admixture and with an air content which makes the composition frost resistence at the same time as the strength is maintained at a high level by adding an alkylene oxide adduct containing nitrogen. It has also proved that the good fluidity achieved by adding this alkylene oxide adduct varies with the temperature to a relatively small extent.The nitrogenous ethylene oxid adduct has the general formulaEMI2.1 where R1 is the group CH2NR4R5 or the group CH2 R4R5R6X where R4, R5 and R6 are alkyl or hydroxyalkyl groups having 1 4 carbon atoms and X is an anion, R2 is an alkyl group having 1 15 carbon atoms, R3 is hydrogen or one of the groupsR2 and R1, nl is a number between 10 and 200, preferably 25 100, n2 is a number between 0 and 100, preferably 0 25, the total number of carbon atoms in the alkyl substituents in the benzene ring being 6 30 and the ratio between nl and n2 more than 2. Alkylene oxide adducts with tertiary nitrogen are usually preferred to the quaternary ones. R4, R5, and R6 are preferably methyl groups.The quantity of the additive is normally 0.01 2, preferably 0.05 1 calculated on the clement weight and is preferably added to the mixing water of the cement containing composition. The term cement refers to a binding agent which cures in the presence of water and which is used for constructional purposes. Examples of different types of cement comprised by the invention are Portland cement and different blended cements with Portland cement as an essential component and aluminious and magnesium cement. The nitrogenous alkylene oxide adduct can be manufactured by a Mannich reaction between a phenol compound, formaldehyde and an amine compound and a subsequent concentration of ethylene oxide or a combination of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The phenol compound, formaldehyde, and the nitrogenous compound are transformed at a temperature below 100 C, at which an amino methyl phenol compound is formed. The molecular ratio between the reactants is approximately 1 mole phenol compound, 1 2 moles of formaldehyde and 1 2.5 moles of the amino compound. Instead of formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde may be used, as this is easily decomposed in the reaction mixture and forms formaldehyde. The use of paraformaldehyde also involves the advantage that the water content of the reaction mixture is limited.If desired, the water formed can be removed by distillation from the reaction mixture containing the Mannich compound or the quaternatedMannich compound, before the amino methyl phenol compound is submitted to an alkoxylation with a suitable number of moles of ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide or mixtures thereof at a temperature of 50 2000C and a pressure of 1 10 atmospheres. The alkoxylation can, if desired, be performed in two or more steps with intermediate distillation of the water present in the reaction mixture. In the case a quaternary ammonium compound is desired, the alkylene oxide adducts are reacted with an appropriate quaternarization agent with a slight deficit at a temperature exceeding the melting point of the alkylene oxide adduct. The phenol compounds used as starting material at the manufacture of the compounds according to the invention have the general formulaEMI4.1 where R2 denotes an alkyl group with 1 15 carbon atoms and R3 denotes hydrogen or an alkyl group with 1 15 carbon atoms, the total number of carbon a toms in the alkyl substituents being 6 30. As example of suitable phenols, nonyl phenol, octyl phenol, dinonyl phenol, and dioctyl phenol can be mentioned. As nitrogenous reactant dialkyl amines with 1 4 carbon atoms in each alkyl substituent can be used. Examples of suitable amines according to the invention are dimethyl amine, methylethyl amine, methylpropyl amine, methylbutyl amine, diethyl amine, dipropyl amine and ethylpropyl amine. As quaternarization agents alkyl chloride or dialkyl sulphate can be used. Examples of such compounds are methyl chloride, ethyl chloride, propyl chlorides, butyl chlorides, dimethyl sulphate and diethyl sulphate. In the case chloride compounds are used, a chloride ion is obtained as anion. If desired, this chloride ion or each other anion can be exchanged for the preferred anion, e.g. by the addition of a salt of the preferred anion having a higher solubility constant than the corresponding chloride salt or by ion exchange in an anion exchanger. Examples of possible ions are nitrate, carbonate, hydroxyl, phosphide, iodide, bromide, methyl sulphate, sulphate, acetate, formate, citrate and tartrate ions. Monovalent ions are generally preferred. The following examples will further illustrate the invention. Example 1 A concrete mixture with a water cement ratio of 0.80 was prepared starting from 12.08 kg Standard Portland cement, 46,80 kg gravel having a particle size of 0 8 mm, and 27.40 kg ballast having a particle size of 8 16 mm. To the preparation water there was added 0.3 , calculated on the cement weight, of an additive according to Table 1. Table 1Test CompoundEMI5.1 EMI5.2 the alkylene oxide is reacted randomly D Melamine sulfonic acid formaldehyde condensateEMI5.3 F without additives In tests A C additives according to the invention were used while tests D F are comparative tests. The different concrete mixtures were then tested with regard to fluidity according to SS 13 71 17, air content according to SS 13 71 11, and compressive strength according to SS 13 72 10. The following results were obtained Table 2Test A B C D E FFluidity cm 0 min 52 51 51 46 51 42 20 min 51 50 50 43 50 38 40 min 50 47 49 41 48 37 60 min 48 43 47 37 48 35Air content 5,6 5,1 5,3 0,65 8,5 1,6StrengthMPa 24 hours 7,0 7,1 7,1 9,1 4,7 10,3 28 days 24,6 24,1 24,8 36,5 16,3 34,2 From the results it can be seen that concrete with an addition according to the invention provides both excellent fluidity during the first hour and an air content of about 5 6 , which is required for concrete to be regarded as frost resistent.
