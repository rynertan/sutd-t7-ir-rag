## Description
Thermoplastic block copolyester resin composition containing a nucleating agent and an acceleratorThe invention relates to a thermoplastic block copolyester resin composition comprising A a block copolyester which substantially consists of repeating intralinear long chain ester units and short chain ester units joined through ester linkages, which long chain ester units correspond to the formulaEMI1.1 and which short chain ester units correspond to the formulaEMI1.2 where G is a divalent radical remaining after the removal of terminal hydroxyl groups from at least one long chain glycol having a melting point not higher than 550C and a number average molecular weight of from 400 4000, R is a divalent radical remaining after removal of carboxyl groups from at least one dicarboxylic acid having a molecular weight of less than 300, and D is a divalent radical remaining after removal of hydroxyl groups from at least one aliphatic diol having a molecular weight of less than 250, with the proviso that the short chain ester units contain at least 85 mole per cent of ethylene terephthalate units, said short chain ester units being present in an amount of 25 85 by weight, based on the copolyester and B a nucleating agent in an amount of 0,01 to 10 by weight, based on the copolyester.Thermoplastic block copolyester resin compositions of the type indicated above are known from, int. al., German Patent Specification 23 52 584 andEuropean Patent Application 51 220.These publications disclose the addition of nucleating agents to copolyesters of the above mentioned composition for the purpose of improving their injection moulding properties.Although the use of the nucleating agents described therein, results in quite a considerable increase in curing rate, the minimum injection moulding temperature which permits injection moulding within a cycle time which is still acceptable for industrial use has been found to be prohibitively high for many plastics processing plants. In actual practice there is therefore a great need for copolyester resin compositions of the type indicated above which still can be injection moulded into objects having a crystalline surface at a lower mould temperature 4 9O0C . The present invention provides a thermoplastic block copolyester resin composition exhibiting these last mentioned properties.The invention consists in that in a block copolyester resin composition of the known type mentioned in the opening paragraph there is also incorporated an accelerator C in an amount such that the heat of cold crystallization AH H per g resin is at least 15 smaller than that of a blend of the components A and B .By accelerators are to be understood here those compounds that promote the mobility of the polymer in its supercooled state.For the determination of the hEE the copolyester resin compositions are first injection moulded into UL bars having a thickness of 1,6 mm cylinder temperature between Tm and Tm 30 C, mould temperature 500C with a residence time in the mould of 30 seconds in a total cycle time of not more than 35 seconds , cooled in liquid nitrogen immediately after being released from the mould and subjected to programmed heating up to 1100C.During heating a temperature curve is registered with the aid of a DSC apparatus Differential Scanning Calorimeter connected to a differentialvanalyser DTA . The surface area of the resulting crystallization exotherm is a measure of the A E.Tm in the temperature at which the peak in the melt curve is reached.Resin compositions displaying a satisfactory hardening rate are generally obtained using an amount of accelerator such that the A is at least 30 smaller than that of a mixture of the components A and B .Preference, however, is given to resin compositions with an amount of accelerating agent such that the A is at least 50 smaller than that of a mixture of the components A and B . It should be added that the addition of an accelerator to a block copolyester of the type indicated above in which a nucleating agent is incorporated is known in itself from European Patent Applications 21 648 and 29 285. In that case the copolyesters contain a maximum amount of 10 by weight of a polyether, the polyether segment exclusively serving as a chemically bound accelerator.Although the presence of a non chemically bound accelerator is not excluded, it does not appear from said applications that the addition envisaged offers any essential advantages.The total amount of accelerator which according to the state of the art may advantageously be added to a polyalkylene terephthalate is generally in the range of 0,1 to 15 by weight, preference being given to an amount in the range of 1 to 6 by weight. In German Patent Specification 29 07 729, for instance, a maximum amount of about 12 by weight is mentioned, whereas US Patent Specification 4 327 007 mentions a maximum amount of 15 by weight, preference being given to an amount in the range of 1 to 6 by weight. French Patent Specification 2 502 162 also mentions a maximum amount of 15 by weight, preference being given to an amount in the range of 2 to 10 by weight.The high proportion of chemically bound accelerator already contained in the block copolyesters described in the afore mentioned German Patent Specification 23 52 584 and the afore mentioned European Patent Application 51 220 implies that the advantages that might be derived from using an additional amount of a non chemically bound accelerator were never considered.The block copolyesters on which the present invention is based are described in US Patent Specification 3 023 192 and British Patent Specification 682 866.The thermoplastic block copolyester resins substantially consist of repeating long chain ester units and short chain ester units. The term long chain ester units as used herein refers to the product of a reaction of a long chain glycol and a dicarboxylic acid.Long chain glycols that can be used for preparing polymers of this invention include the poly alkylene oxide glycols where the alkylene isC2 C8, such as poly ethylene oxide glycol, poly l,2 and 1,3propylene oxide glycol, poly tetramethylene oxide glycol, poly penta methylene oxide glycol, polyboctamethylene oxide glycol and poly 1,2 butylene oxide glycol random or block copolymers of ethylene oxide and 1,2 propylene oxide and polyformals prepared by reacting formaldehyde with glycols, such as pentamethylene glycol, or mixtures of glycols, such as a mixture of tetramethylene and pentamethylene glycols. Other satisfactory long chain polymeric glycols include polybutadiene or polyisoprene glycols, copolymers of these, and saturated hydrogenated products of these materials.Preferred long chain glycols are poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 600 2000 and ethylene oxide capped poly propylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of 1500 2800 and containing 15 35 ethylene oxide.The short chain ester units are the products of the reaction of a low molecular weight diol and a dicarboxylic acid.Of the short chain ester units either at least 85 mole are ethylene terephthalate units, resulting from the reaction of ethylene glycol with terephthalic acid. Low molecular weight diols other than ethylene glycol which react to form short chain ester units are aliphatic diols having molecular weights of less than about 250. The term aliphatic diols as used herein should be construed to include cycloaliphatic diols.Usually diols having 3 15 carbon atoms can be used. Representative diols include propylene, pentamethylene, 2,2 dimethyltrimethylene, hexamethylene, and decamethylene glycols, dihydroxy cyclohexane, cyclohexane dimethanol, and mixtures thereof. 0,5 to 10 mole 8 of the ethylene glycol can be satisfactorily replaced with a codiol having 4 to 10 carbon atoms, of which the hydroxyl groups are separated by branched or non branched alkylene groups having 3 to 4 carbon atoms, and which codiol has at least one secondary or tertiary hydroxyl group or two primary hydroxyl groups and is unsubstituted or mono or dialkyl substituted, the sUm of the number of carbon atoms of the substituents being at least 4. Examples of such low molecular weight codiols include 2 ethyl hexane diol 1,3, 3 methyl pentane diol 1,4, 2dimethyl pentane diol 2,4, 2,2,4trimethyl pentane diol 1,3, 2,2 diethyl propane diol 1,3, butane diol1,4, hexane diol 2,5, propane diol 1,3 and butane diol 1,3. Dicarboxylic acids other than terephthalic acid which can be reacted with the foregoing long chain glycols and short chain diols to form the polymer of this invention are aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, or aromatic dicarboxylic acids having a molecular weight of less than 300.The term wdicarboxylic acids as used herein includes equivalents of dicarboxylic acids having two functional carboxyl groups which perform substantially like dicarboxylic acids in reaction with long chain glycols or low molecular weight diols in forming copolyesters.The equivalents include esters and ester forming derivatives, such as acid chlorides and anhydrides.The dicarboxylic acids can contain any substituents which do not or hardly interfere with the polymer formation and use of the polymer of this invention.Aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, as the term is used herein, refers to carboxylic acids having two carboxyl groups each attached to a saturated carbon atom. If the carbon atom to which the carboxyl group is attached is saturated and is in a ring, the acid is cycloaliphatic. Aliphatic or cycloaliphatic acids having conjugated unsaturation often cannot be used because of homopolymerization. However, some unsaturated acids, such as maleic acid, can be used.Aromatic dicarboxylic acids, as the term is used herein, are dicarboxylic acids having two carboxyl groups attached to a carbon atom in an isolated or fused benzene ring. It is not necessary that both functional carboxyl groups be attached to the same aromatic ring and where more than one ring is present, they can be joined by aliphatic or aromatic divalent radicals or divalent radicals such as O or SO2 . Representative aliphatic and cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids that can be used in this invention are sebacic acid, 1,3 cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, 1,4 cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, adipic acid, glutaric acid, succinic acid, carbonic acid, oxalic acid, azelaic acid, diethylmalonic acid, allyl malonic acid, 4 cyclohexane 1,2 dicarboxylic acid, cr ethyl suberic acid, a,a ,13, 3 tetramethylsuccinic acid, cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid, decabydro l,5 naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, 4,4 bicyclohexyl dicarboxylic acid, decahydro 2,6 naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, 4,4 methylenebis cyclohexyl carboxylic acid , 3,4 furan dicarboxylic acid, and l,l cyclobutane dicarboxylic acid. Preferred aliphatic acids and cycloaliphatic acids are cyclohexane dicarboxylic acids and adipic acid.Representative aromatic dicarboxylic acids which can be used include phthalic and isophthalic acids, bibenzoic acid, substituted dicarboxy compounds with two benzene nuclei such as bis p carboxyphenyl methane, p oxy p carboxyphenyl benzoic acid, ethylene bis p oxybenzoic acid , 1,5 naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, 2,6 naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, 2,7 naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, phenanthrene dicarboxylic acid, anthracene dicarboxylic acid, 4,41 sulfonyl dibenzoic acid, and C1 Ct2 alkyl and ring substitution derivatives thereof, such as halo, alkoxy, and aryl derivatives. Bydroxyl acids such as p ss hydroxyethoxy benzoic acid can also be used providing an aromatic dicarboxylic acid is also present.As acids used in addition to terephthalic acid, aromatic dicarboxylic acids are a preferred class for preparing the copolyester polymers of this invention. Among the aromatic acids, those with 8 16 carbon atoms are preferred, particularly the phenylene dicarboxylic acids, i.e., phthalic and isophthalic acids.It is of essential importance that at least 85 mole per cent of the short chain ester units should be ethylene terephthalate units. Therefore at least 85 mole of the dicarboxylic acid incorporated into the polymer should consist of terephthalic acid and at least 85 mole of the low molecular weight glycol incorporated into the polymer should consist of ethylene glycol. This means that at least either 85 of the total R groups in formulae I and II are 1,4 phenylene radicals. Less than 85 of the R groups either in formula I or in formula II may therefore be 1,4 phenylene, provided that at least 85 of the total R groups in the two formulae are l,4 phenylene radicals. At least about 85 of the D groups in formula II are ethylene groups derived from ethylene glycol .The short chain ester units constitute about 25 85 by weight of the copolyester, preferably from 30 80 by weight, since within that range polymers having the most favourable physical properties are obtained. Preferred block copolyesters for use in the compositions of this invention are those prepared from dimethyl terephthalate, ethylene glycol and poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of about 600 2000 or ethylene oxide capped poly propylene oxide glycol having a number average molecular weight of about 1500 2800 and an ethylene oxide content of 15 35 by weight. Optionally, up to 15 mole per cent of the dimethyl terephthalate in these polymers can be replaced by dimethyl phthalate or dimethyl isophthalate or up to 15 mole per cent of the ethylene glycol by another low molecular weight diol.The block copolyesters described herein are made by a conventional ester interchange reaction which, preferably, takes place in the presence of an antioxidant. A preferred procedure involves heating the dimethyl ester of terephthalic acid and polyalkylene oxide glycol in the presence of a molar excess of ethylene glycol and a catalyst at about 150 2600C and a pressure of 0,05 to 0,5 MPa, while distilling off methanol formed by the ester interchange. The resulting low molecular weight prepolymer can be carried to a high molecular weight copolyetherester by distilling off the excess of the low molecular weight diol. This final distillation is generally run at less than 670 Pa, preferably less than 250 Pa, and a temperature between 2000 and 2800C for less than 2 hours, preferably for about 0,5 to 1,5 hours. In the ester interchange reactions use is generally made of a catalyst. Commonly employed catalyst systems are antimony trioxide and organic titanates such as tetrabutyl titanate used alone or in combination with magnesium acetate or calcium acetate. The catalyst is generally employed in an amount of 0,005 to 2,0 by weight of the reaction mixture.Polycondensation of low molecular weight polymers can also be accomplished in the solid phase by heating finely divided polymer particles in vacuo or in a stream of an inert gas.The nucleating agent B to be incorporated into the thermoplastic block copolyester resin compositions according to the invention may be an inert insoluble substance or a salt of an organic mono or polycarboxylic acid.The inert insoluble substances are generally inorganic substances having a particle size not greater than 2 to 3 V m. They are generally employed in concentrations not higher than 1 by weight.Examples of such solid nucleating agents include talc, calcium silicate and or magnesium silicate, titanium dioxide, magnesium oxide, calcium carbonate, borium nitride, sodium fluoride and calcium fluoride.Preference, however, is given to salts of mono or polycarboxylic acids very favourable results are generally obtained when the nucleating agent is a salt of an alkali metal or an alkali earth metal.Favourable results are obtained by using a nucleating agent which is a sodium salt or potassium salt of an organic acid having 7 to 30 carbon atoms or a sodium salt or potassium salt of an organic polymer having carboxyl groups.Examples of these acids which are fatty acids are stearic acid, pelargonic acid and behenic acid. As further examples may be mentioned the sodium salts or potassium salts of carboxyl groups containing organic polymers, such as copolymers of alkenes and acrylic or methacrylic acids, or copolymers of aromatic alkenes and maleic anhydride. Preferred are the sodium salt or potassium salt of ethylene methacrylic acid copolymers and also wholly or partially neutralized salts, e.g., the approximately 30 neutralized salts , the sodium salt of styrene maleic anhydride copolymers and also wholly or partially neutralized salts, e.g., the approximately 30 neutralized salts and sodium versatate. The alkene or the aromatic alkene is generally contained in the abovementioned copolymers in an amount of 50 98 by weight, preferably 80 98 by weight, calculated on the copolymer.Preference is given to the sodium salt of the copolymer of ethylene and methacrylic acid. The copolymers may be prepared by the known method of high pressure polymerization. As further examples of nucleating agents that may be incorporated into the resin compositions of the present invention may be mentioned sodium formiate, sodium acetate, calcium acetate, barium acetate, sodium glycolate, sodium tartrate, sodium stearate, sodium montanate, sodium salicylate, sodium benzoate which may optionally be substituted with a nitro group, halogen atom, hydroxy group, phenyl group or oxyphenyl group, the sodium salt of a mixture of branched monocarboxylic acids obtained by reaction of acetic anhydride with anc1 olefin having 20 50 carbon atoms in the presence of Mn III acetate, the disodium salt of dimeric oleic acid, the sodium salt of C10 C50 alkyl subsituted succinic acid and or the sodium salts of polyhydric phenols.The nucleating action of the afore mentioned nucleating agents may be further enhanced by adding the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A and or the oligomeric reaction product of epichlorohydrin and bisphenol A.The amount of nucleating agent to be added in order to obtain acceptable results very much depends on the type of nucleant applied.Generally, amounts less than 0,01 by weight will not lead to any significant effect. Amounts exceeding 10 will generally have a detrimental effect on the physical properties of the polymer.As a rule, favourable results are obtained using an amount in the range of from 0,05 to 5 by weight, calculated on the weight of the block copolyester.It should be noted that some fillers also act as nucleants. It will be obvious that block copolyester resin compositions which contain such a filler in a concentration exceeding 10 by weight of the resin composition also form part of the present invention. As an example of such a nucleating agent may be mentioned talc, more particularly microtalc.Just as the nucleating agent B the accelerator C may be chosen from a large variety of compounds. Generally suitable for use are those compounds that promote the flexibility of the short chain ester units, viz.polyethylene terephthalate units, without there being considerable interaction with the long chain ester units. It has been found that favourable results are generally obtained when the accelerator C is selected from the group of the following compounds a organic esters obtained from an aromatic carboxylic acid having 7 11 carbon atoms and at least 1 carboxyl group per aromatic core and an alcohol of the formula HOCK2 xR wherein x represents 1, 2 or 3 and R a hydrocarbon radical having 2 15 carbon atoms, preferably 2 10 carbon atoms or an alcohol of the formula B0 R O yR y wherein y represents a whole number from 1 15, preferably 1 8, RW a hydrocarbon radical having 2 15 carbon atoms, preferably 2 8 carbon atoms, and R a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon radical having 2 20 carbon atoms, preferably 2 12 carbon atoms, b organic ketones of the formulaEMI10.1 c organic sulphones of the formula RSOOR, d organic sulphoxides of the formula R2SO, e organic nitriles of the formula RCN, f organic amides of the formulaEMI10.2 g organic thio ethers of the formula RXR, where X represents an oxygen atom or a sulphur atom, or h oligomers of the compounds mentioned under a through g where R in the formulae under b f represents a hydrocarbon group having 1 25 carbon atoms R in the formula under f represents a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon group having 1 25 carbon atoms and R in the formula under g has the meaning of an aromatic group having 6 to 10 carbon atoms, R represents a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 25 carbon atoms and n is a whole number from 2 to 15.It has also been found that favourable results may be obtained if as as accelerator there is used a substance which acts as a plasticizer at processing temperatures and consequently cause the melt viscosity to decrease, but have practically no plasticizing effect at room tempera ture. These substances are usually referred to as internal lubricants. Examples of internal lubricants are described, among other places, inEuropean Patent Specification No. 11 325.Preferred organic esters of the component C are the esters in which the aromatic carboxylic acids are hydrocarbon acids having 1 3 carboxyl groups and the alcohols are aliphatic. In other words, the R groups in the alcohols are alkyl groups or alkylene groups, depending on the particular R group. Preferably also when the carboxylic acids contain two or more carboxyl groups the carboxyl groups should all be reacted to form ester COO linkages, that is there will be no free carboxyl groups present in the ester. Likewise it is preferred that all hydroxyl groups of the alcohols should be reacted to form ester coo linkages, that is there will be no free hydroxyl groups present in the ester. Preferred is a group of esters in which the acid is benzoic acid and the alcohol is of the formula HOCH2 2 R , wherein R represents an alkylene group having 4 6 carbon atoms preferably neopentyl glycol or an alcohol of the formula HO R O wherein R represents an ethylene group or a propylene group and y is 2 or 3.Ketones, sulphones, sulphoxides, nitriles, amides and ethers which are to be preferred are those in which the R groups in the above formulae of these compounds are aryl groups having 6 10 carbon atoms or alkyl groups having 1 10 carbon atoms.Examples of suitable compounds selected from the above mentioned group of compounds include the dibenzoate of neopentyl glycol, the dibenzoate of triethylene glycol, the dihenzoate of diethylene glycol, the dibenzoate of dipropylene glycol, tris 2 ethylhexyl trimellitate, phenyl benzoate, trimethylol ethane tribenzoate, dioctylphthalate, diisodecylphthalate, benzophenone, 4 fluorobenzophenone, diphenyl sulphone,N ethyl o,p toluene sulphonamide, tolyl sulphoxide, lauryl nitrile, erucyl nitrile, diphenyl ether, and oligomers thereof, such as poly mphenylene oxide containing about 9 phenylene oxide groups .In order that a composition may be obtained whose AN is at least 15 smaller than that of an identical composition into which no accelerator is incorporated, the amount of accelerator to be incorporated into the block copolyester resin compositions according to the invention will generally be in the range of 0,5 to 15 by weight, calculated on the resin composition. Satisfactory results will generally be obtained when the accelerator is used in an amount of 1 to 5 by weight. The optimum amount of accelerator to be incorporated very much depends on the type of accelerator and the composition of the block copolyester.As in the case of the nucleating agents, particular substances that are added to the resin compositions for quite a different purpose also may act as accelerator. In this connection mention is made of the halogenated products of the afore mentioned accelerators, which combine a crystallization accelerating function with a fire retarding function.Also the carnauba wax used as release agent appears to have an acceler ating effect on the hardening of the present copolyesters. As the amount thereof that may be used is generally not higher than 1 by weight, the hardening rate of the resin composition may be further increased by additional incorporation into it of one or more of the afore mentioned accelerators.As the components B and C incorporated into the compositions of the invention have an accelerating effect on the hardening rate of the block copolyesters, products displaying a high gloss are obtained at a mould temperature below 900C.In addition, the resin compositions according to the invention may be modified by the incorporation therein of various conventional inorganic fillers, such as carbon black, silica gel, aluminium oxide, clay and glass fibres.Into the resin compositions according to the invention there may also be incorporated colourants, mould release agents, antioxidants, U.V.stabilizers, fire retarding additives, etc.The resin compositions according to the invention are prepared by mixing the various components in suitable equipment. For example, in a suitable mixer, e.g. a tumbler, the block copolyester while dry is mixed with the components B and C, optionally in the presence of a filler, after which the mixture is extruded from the melt.The invention will be further described in the following examples, which is of course not to be construed as limiting the protective scope of the invention.Example IA copolyester was prepared containing 58 by weight of polyethylene terephthalate PETP units and 42 by weight of polytetramethylene oxide glycol terephthalate PTHTTP units. The molecular weight of the polytetramethylene oxide glycol was 1000. Granules of this polymer, which had a relative viscosity of 2,4 g measured in a 1 by weight solution of the polymer in o chlorophenol at 25 C were sprayed with an aqueous solution of sodium benzoate in such an amount as corresponds to 0,25 by weight of sodium benzoate, calculated on the weight of the copoly etherester.After drying separate batches of these granules were provided with 0,3 by weight of carnauba wax, 0,33 by weight of carnauba wax and 3 by weight of diphenyl oxide, 0,38 by weight of carnauba wax and 2,58 by weight of neopentyl glycol dibenzoate NPGD or 2 by weight of calcium montanate, respectively, at a temperature of 1100C. Another batch contained 0,5 by weight of microtalc charged into the autoclave during the preparation of the polymer as nucleating agent, 0,3 by weight of carnauba wax and 3 by weight of diphenyl oxide DFE .The granules thus treated were injection moulded into ISO I impact test bars in an Arburg Allrounder injection moulding machine cylinder temperature 2250C, a cycle of 0,3 15 15 3 seconds and a follow up pressure of 5000 kPa at a mould temperature of 50 C. Immediately upon their release from the mould the injection moulded products were solidified by quenching in liquid nitrogen. Subseguently, a temperature curve was registered with the aid of a Differential Scanning Calorimeter. The samples were subjected to programmed heating from 300C to a temperature of 1100C. In this way the heat of cold crystallization AHH was determined.The results are given in the table below, in which NaB stands for sodium benzoate, CW for carnauba wax, DFE for diphenyl oxide, NPGD for neopentyl glycol dibenzoate, CaM for calcium montanate, PETP for polyethylene terephthalate and PTHFTP for polytetrahydrofuran terephthalate.

The granules thus treated were injected moulded into UL 94 bars 1,6 mm thick with the aid of an Arbury Allrounder injection moulding machine at a mould temperature of 500C.The injection moulding conditions are given in the table below.
