# Use of peelable film forming organopolysiloxane compositions.

## Abstract
Room temperature storable, heat curable organopolysilox ane compositions which comprise silicon bonded vinyl radicals, silicon bonded hydrogen atoms, a platinum type compound and characterized by an unsaturated hydrocarbon compound of the conjugated ene yne type provide a release surface for tacky substances when coated onto the surface of a base material and heated, even mildly. The release surface possesses a time stable release ability, particularly for pressure sensitive adhesive bearing articles such as tapes and labels.
