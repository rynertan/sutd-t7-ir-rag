# Process for producing tufted fabric, backing therefor and fabric produced by the process.

## Abstract
A process of producing a tufted pile fabric comprises providing a primary backing 5 which may be woven, non woven or knitted fabric and containing for example poly propylene, polyester, polyamide, jute or viscose rayon, applying a meltable fibrous layer 6,7, to both sides of the primary backing 5, preferably by needling fibres into the backing 5, inserting pile tufts 8,9 into the primary backing 5 so that parts of the pile tufts extend through backing 5 and the meltable fibrous layers 6,7, and melting the fibrous layer 6 which is on the side of the backing 5 opposite the pile forming surface of the tufts to secure the tufts to the backing and provide an anchor coat for the fabric. The meltable fibre may be polyamide fibre with a melting point in the range 80 150 C. and may conveniently be Grilon K115 Grilon is a Registered Trade Mark . The process may be used to provide mother and daughter tufted pile fabrics by applying a second primary backing 15 with meltable fibrous layers 16 applied thereto to the pile forming surface of the first fabric and melt ing the fibrous layers 16 of the second primary backing 15 to adhere the latter to the pile forming surface of the tufts, and thereafter slitting the tufts intermediate the two primary backings 10,15.
