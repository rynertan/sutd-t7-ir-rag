# Method of fabricating optical glass base material.

## Abstract
A method of fabricating an optical glass base material by injecting and depositing glass fine particles produced by chemically reacting glass stock which comprises means 2 for growing the glass fine particles in a depositing direction to form porous rod shaped base material 24 , support means 4 for supporting the porous rod shaped base ma terial 24 after growing, and heat treatment means 3 for sintering at least the outer periphery of the rod shaped base material 24 in a semisintered state to harden the same be fore supporting the rod shaped base material by said sup port means 4 . Thus, since the rod shaped base material 24 is held in a stable state through the support means 4 and the base material 24 has improved mechanical strength due to the semisintering hardening through the heat treating means 3 before being supported by the sup port means 4 , the base material 24 is not deformed nor damaged in the supported state, and large quantities of base material may be fabricated.
