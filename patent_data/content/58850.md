# Plug installation apparatus.

## Abstract
A plug installation apparatus comprises a mechanism for moving an internally captured expander member 26 relative to a plug 24 wherein it is captured thereby expanding the plug 24 into contact with the internal surface of a tube 18 within which the plug 24 is disposed. The apparatus further comprises a sensor mechanism 50 for determining that the plug 24 has been properly inserted in the tube 18 prior to expanding the plug 24 for preventing improper expansion of the plug 24 . The apparatus may also have force measuring devices 38 for determining and verifying that the proper amount of force has been applied to the expander member 26 .
