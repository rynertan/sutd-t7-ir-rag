# Hydrogen peroxide compositions.

## Abstract
The effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide for bleaching and disinfecting at ambient to hand hot temperatures can be enhanced by reaction with a peracid generator activator , but the provision of storage stable concentrated aqueous liquid premixes of hydrogen peroxide and activator presents many problems arising from the physical and chemical properties of the components. The present invention provides aqueous acidic emul sions of hydrogen peroxide and enol esters, preferably at a pH of 2 to 5 and containing a slight excess of hydrogen peroxide over an equivalent mole ratio to enol ester activator of 1 1. The concentrations of the components of some prefer red emulsions are selected in the ranges of 3 to 20 hydrogen peroxide, 30 to 85 water, 10 to 30 enol ester s by weight based upon the emulsion and from 10 to 70 by weight based on the enol ester of emulsifiers. In preferred compositions, the activator is selected from vinyl or isopropenyl or but 1 enyl or cyclohex 1 enyl acetate or benzoate and divinyl adipate or phthalate, and 1,5 diacetoxypenta 1,4 diene. The compositions can be used as such or upon dilution with aqueous media and in conjunction with detergent compositions, and for cleaning and disinfecting absorbent or non absorbent materials.
