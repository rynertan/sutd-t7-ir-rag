# Joint having ball and shaft coupled through plastic deformation.

## Abstract
A joint structure for bonding a ball and a shaft comprising a ball 1, 11, 33 having a mounting hole 1A, 11A, 33A bored toward a center thereof a corrugated surface 1B, 22A, 33B effective to bond and formed in an inner circumferential sur face of the mounting hole and a shaft 2, 22 fitted into the mounting hole and made of softer material than that of the ball. An outer circumferential portion of the shaft is plastically lo cally deformed in the vicinity of the corrugated surface of the mounting hole. The two components are bonded to each other with a tightening force.
