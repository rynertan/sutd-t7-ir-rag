# PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS HAVING CONTACTS AND METHOD OF APPLYING SAME

## Abstract
Electrically conductive contacts containing zinc or other solderable metals, and aluminum are formed on the front and or back surfaces of a solar cell. They are deposited by spraying the metals onto the cell surfaces, together or a layers, with the aluminum containing layer in direct contact with the cell surfaces.
