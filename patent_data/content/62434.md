# Insoluble crosslinked cytotoxic oxidase peroxidase system.

## Abstract
A therapeutic preparation, and a process of using the preparation, for the control of tumour growth and infectious diseases. The preparation is an immobilized cytotoxic enzyme system which is carried by an insoluble substrate that is admin istered into the mammalian subject by injection or implanta tion. The preferred embodiment of the preparation uses a po lymerized albumin carrier containing immobilized glucose oxi dase and peroxidase. The immobilized enzyme system is pre pared in the form of small particles that can be administered ei ther by implantation or by injection into tumour bearing mam mals. To date, antibacterial activity has been demonstrated on ly in vitro. Intraperitoneal injection into rats bearing Novikoff hepatomas or into mice bearing B16 F1 melanomas or L1210 Lymphoid tumours has resulted in the selected killing of tu mour tissues. Several daily administrations are required to achieve complete destruction of the tumour. Additionally, the preparation is also active as a stimulant of the specific immune response to neoplasia. Its effect on the immune system could be useful in the stimulation of the immune system in diseases where the action of the endogenous immune system is insuffi cient.
