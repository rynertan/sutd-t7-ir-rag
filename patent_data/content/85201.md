# Flame retardant polyphenylene ether styrene thermoplastic resin compositions.

## Abstract
A flame retardant polyphenylene ether styrene resin composition having a UL 94 rating of V 1 or better, a heat distortion temperature greater than 92 C and a melt viscosity at 260 C of less than 200 pascal second is obtained by incorporating with said polyphenylene ether styrene resin composition from about 4 to about 7 parts per hundred of a triaryl phosphate ester and from about 0.5 to about 3 parts per hundred of a 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxide having the formula
