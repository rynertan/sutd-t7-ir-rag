# Personal electrocardiogram monitor.

## Abstract
A pocket sized, self contained electrocardiogram moni tor with a dot matrix, liquid crystal display. The monitor uses dry electrodes and is suitable for direct placement against the patient s chest without the use of paste or gel to insure electrical contact. An A D converter converts an ECG signal to a digital signal which is then processed by a microproces sor and then displayed on the liquid crystal display in real time. The microprocessor is programmed to select the maximum and minimum digital values from four consecu tive samples from the A D converter and to supply data representative of the maximum and minimum values to the display at one fourth the conversion sampling rate.
