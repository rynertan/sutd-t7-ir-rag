# A method and apparatus for separating from each other two thin, slack sheets of material.

## Abstract
When two sheets of slack material, for example the two sides of a paper or plastics bag, are to be separated by means of a pointed tool, problems arise because the two sheets can easily bend over, both in the same direction. If moreover these sheets are formed from smooth material, they also adhere together by vacuum sealing or by electros tatical forces. The solution for these problems is to enclose said sheets 17a, b into a positioning block 10a, b in which a hollow space is recessed or saved for receiving the volume of the pointed tool 19 to be driven thereinbetween. This driving in of the pointed tool can be combined with the issuance of pressurized air between the sheets. To this end the pointed tool is provided with grooves for guiding said pressurized air or with a separate blow pipe 18 slidable over the pointed tool.
