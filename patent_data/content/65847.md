# Liquid level control.

## Abstract
Apparatus for controlling the level 12 of liquid 11 in a container 10 such as a carbonated liquid dispenser com prises a float operated valve 14, 15 in an upper part 16 of the container 10 , which when opened due to a fall in the level 12 of liquid 11 in the container 10 as liquid 11 is drawn therefrom, allows gas under pressure Y to escape from the upper part 16 of the container 10 into a cylinder 17 . In the cylinder 17 is a pressure operated switch 19, 20 or valve which controls the supply 21 of liquid to the container to replace that drawn off, and a bleed valve 22 which allows leakage of gas from the cylinder 17 to atmosphere so that the gas pressure in the cylinder 17 falls when the drawn off liquid is replaced and the float operated valve 14, 15 closes. The pressure operated switch 19, 20 or a valve then stops the supply 23 of liquid to the container 10 to maintain the level 12 of liquid 11 in the container 10 .

## Description
LIQUID LEVEL CONTROLThis invention relates to apparatus for use in controlling the level of liquid in a container of such liquid. The invention has particular application to apparatus in which quantities of the liquid are withdrawn from the liquid reservoir in the container at periodic intervals, which container is maintained at an elevated pressure.Devices of the above type are known in which a float in the container is connected via a mechanical linkage to a switch which controls the supply of liquid to the container. Alternatively the float may operate a proximity switch which controls the liquid supply or low voltage electrodes are provided in the container and the conductivity through the gas or liquid medium between such electrodes is sensed and used to control the liquid supply switch. Such devices tend to be unreliable and or expensive, and it is an object of the present invention to provide means for controlling the level of liquid in a container which is simple in operation, reliable and inexpensive to install and maintain.The invention provides means for controlling the level of liquid in a container comprising a float operated valve in said container, a cylinder in fluid flow connection with said container upon opening of said valve, pressure operable control means responsive to the fluid pressure in said cylinder and adapted to supply liquid to said container and bleed valve means adapted to control leakage of fluid from said cylinder.The control means may comprise an electrical switch which is connected to means for supplying liquid to said container. Such supplying means may comprise a solenoid operated valve which on actuation allows liquid under pressure to flow to said container.Alternatively such supplying means may be an electrical pump operable to supply liquid to said container.Alternatively the control means may comprise a pressure operable valve which on actuation allows liquid under pressure to flow to said container.Preferably said float operated valve is located in an upper part of said container above the level of liquid therein. Said upper part may contain a gas under pressure, which gas preferably is air. Means may be provided for supplying gas under pressure to said upper part.The bleed valve means may comprise an aperture in a wall of said cylinder, or alternatively a portion of such wall which is porous to the fluid in said cylinder.The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figs. 1 to 4 show one embodiment in sequence of operation.Referring now to Fig. 1 there is shown a container 10 in which a reservoir of liquid 11 is contained, the liquid 11 having a level 12 under normal non operating conditions. A float 13 has a needle 14 connected therewith, which needle 14 forms part of a valve 15 mounted in the upper part 16 of the container 10 above the liquid level 12. In the non operating conditions shown in Fig. 1 the valve 15 is closed and air under pressure P is contained in the upper part 16 of the container. A cylinder 17 is mounted on the container 10 so as to be in fluid flow connection via inlet 18 with the upper part 16 of the container 10 when valve 15 is open. A diaphragm 19 is provided at the end of cylinder 17 and is coupled to a switch 20. The switch 20 is electrically connected to a pump or solenoid operated valve 21 by means of which liquid may be supplied to the container 10.In the non operating conditions shown in Fig. 1 the switch 20 is open so that no liquid is being supplied to container 10.If liquid is now drawn from container 10 through an outlet not shown the liquid level 12 will fall and float 15 will fall also, thus opening valve 15. Air will therefore pass along inlet 18 into cylinder 17.This situation is shown in Fig. 2. At this stage the pressure Y of the air in upper part 16 of container 10 will fall and the air pressure X in cylinder 17 will rise, thus causing diaphragm 19 to move and actuate switch 20. Closing of switch 20 causes actuation of pump or valve 21 to supply liquid to container 10 to replace that drawn therefrom. At this stage there will be a small leakage of air from cylinder 17 through the bleed valve 22, the leakage rate being dependent upon the size of the aperture or the porosity of a plug or membrane across such aperture. A suitable material from which such a plug may be made is PORVAIR . Eventually the situation shown in Fig. 3 will be reached in which the liquid level 12 has fallen to its lowermost level as the draw off of the liquid from container 10 is terminated and before the effect of the supply of further liquid raises the level 12. At this stage the valve 15 is at its most open and the pressure of air in upper part 16 of container 10 and cylinder 17 has equalised at Y . This is the maximum pressure reached in cylinder 17 and maximum leakage through bleed valve 22 occurs. Subsequently due to such leakage the pressure in cylinder 17 will start to fall.The liquid level 12 will rise due to the influx of liquid from the supply 21 so that valve 15 will eventually close as shown in Fig. 4. when this situation is reached the pressure in cylinder 17 will reduce due to leakage through bleed valve 22 of air which now cannot be replaced by air from the upper part 16 of the container 10. The falling pressure in cylinder 17 causes the diaphragm 19 to return tow ards the position occupied initially, thus opening switch 20 and cutting off the electrical supply to the pump or valve 21. As a consequence no further liquid will be supplied to container 10 so that the liquid level 12 is then at the position shown in Fig. 1.The pressure in cylinder 17 will continue to fall until it reaches ambient pressure as apertains in the conditions shown in Fig. 1. The pressure of air in the upper part 16 of container 10 is restored to the valve Y by means of air supply means 23. The cycle is repeated each time that liquid is drawn from container 10 and the liquid level 12 is thus restored to its original level after each such liquid draw off. The apparatus described above is particularly suited to the provision of carbonated beverages, the pump 21 supplying water at a pressure above that of the carbon dioxide which is at a pressure required to carbonate the water.The response or rate of operation of the apparatus may be varied by provision of a lost motion linkage between float 13 and needle 14. Also further variation may be achieved by varying the size of inlet 18 and aperture 22 and or the porosity of a plug located in such aperture as previously mentioned. Yet further variation may be achieved by the use of an elastic material to form the wall of cylinder 17 so as to store a greater volume of air under pressure therein.A further advantageous effect resulting from the use of the above described apparatus in connection with the dispensing of carbonated beverages is that air or other gases which are released when water is sprayed into the pressurised container 10 pass through valve 15 and away to atmosphere. In this way upper part 16 of the container 10 is purged of such air and other gases so that reabsorption into the water is prevented or substantially reduced and the maximum carbon dioxide content in the carbonated water is thereby maintained. As a further modification of the apparatus the bleed valve 22 may include a spring loaded closure member 24 as shown in the open position in dotted lines inFig. 1. The spring rate of such a device is chosen so that the pressure in cylinder 17 must be above a predetermined value before valve 22 opens. In the situation shown in Fig. 4 therefore, the pressure in cylinder 17 will only fall to that at which valve 22 is closed. In consequence, when liquid 11 is drawn from container 10, liquid level 12 falls and valve 15 opens, the pressure in cylinder 17 quickly reaches that required to close switch 20, and liquid is then supplied to container 10. In this way the fall in liquid level 12 and the drop in pressure from Y to Y is kept to a minimum. Such an arrangement is suitable for critical control of the liquid level 12 and in the event that there is a relatively small pressure differential between that in the container 10 and that required to operate the switch 20.As an alternative to electrical switch 20 the diaphragm 19 may actuate a valve comprised in a pneumatic or hydraulic control system for valve or pump 21.
