# Blind fastener.

## Abstract
A one piece blind fastener 10 having a head 15 and a tubular body portion 21 which body portion 21 has a central threaded bore 23 therethrough. Such head 15 rests against a plate structure 11 so that a draw rod 36 can upset the tu bular body 21 to secure the plate structure 11 against the head 15 . The tubular body 21 serves as a nut plate. A flanged portion 16 extends laterally from the head 15 and contains an opening 30 to accommodate a rivet 45 that se cures the fastener 10 to the plate structure 11 and permits torquing a bolt into and out of said threaded bore 23 .

## Description
BLIND FASTENER BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to fasteners and more particularly to thread locking type blind fasteners that can be installed entirely from one side of a structure wherein provision is made to suitably anchor such fastener to permit torquing of the fastener without encountering any spin of the fastener. Such blind fasteners are used where it is not practical or possible to drill and tap the structure or where the other side of the structure is non accessible. Various designs of blind fasteners consisting of threaded tubular bodies which can be inserted through a hole in a structure and expanded to bear against the back or blind side of the structure such that the threaded portion will function as a stationary nut for fastening the desired external component. The upsetting process which expands that portion of the fastener against the back surface of the structure must be secure enough and complete to prevent future rotation of the fastener itself when rotating the screw, which may be repeated several times. Problems of rotation of the fastener occur only after repeated removal and replacement of the screw where repeated torquing of the screw is made.Such is particularly true of the thread locking type wherein the lower portiqn of the internally threaded portion is of a slightly smaller diameter to assure a firm threaded engagement so that the attaching bolt does not work loose. In these instances there may be a tendency to rotate the blind fastener. The present invention contemplates the provision of an off setting surface portion of the fastener which can accommodate a rivet to anchor the fastener in place and thus permit considerable torquing of the fastener body and its corresponding screw component. Such fastener is simple in construction and inexpensive, providing for maximum strength against pulling out of the hole or against slippage if there were insufficient bearing surface and the fastener rotated on its own when the screw were rotated. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A blind fastener having a tubular body and a head with a laterally extending flange portion that has an opening therein. The axis of the opening is parallel to a threaded bore in such tubular body.The tubular body is insertable into a hole of a structure such as a plate with the head seated against the structure. A draw rod is threaded into the threaded bore of the tubular body and tensioned to upset the tubular body thereby expanding the body as it is drawn toward the structure to effectively capture the blind fastener to the structure which has the head bearing on one side of the structure and the expanded portion bearing on the other or blind side of the structure. The opening in the flanged portion receives a rivet to securely fasten such blind fastener to the structure to facilitate the torquing of the blind fastener when attaching a bolt to the central bore thereof.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements in the several views, there is shown in Fig. 1 a. blind fastener 10 intended to serve as a nut plate for a screw to hold an external component to a sheet metal or similar structure 11. The blind fastener 10 has a head 15 that is tear dropped in shape in plan view having a laterally extending flange portion 16. The fastener 10 has a longitudinal extending shank or hollow cylindrical body 21 and a reduced outside diameter cylindrical end portion for thread locking 22. The length of the hollow body 21 is over twice its diameter. The bore 23 of the hollow cylindrical body 21 is of stepped diameter with the smallest diameter at the end farthest from the head, as at cylindrical end portion 22 where it is tapped to produce threads 25 for reception of the draw rod and later of the fastening bolt or screw. That portion of the bore 23 adjacent to the intermediate portion of the hollow body 21 is formed with an off set 26 defining an upper bore portion of reduced thickness 27 that is larger in diameter than the threaded portion 25.The threaded portion 25 extends upward to the off set 26 but has a slightly greater internal diameter as it extends upwardly to provide for a thread locking fit at end portion 22.Longitudinal slits may be provided in the upper body portion of the fastener as defined by the upper bore portion 27 to facilitate the upsetting of the cylindrical body portion of the fastener. The laterally extending flanged portion 16 of the head 15 has a bore or opening 30 extending therethrough with a chamfered portion 31 at the upper end portion. The fastener 10 is installed by screwing it onto the tip 35 of a high strength threaded draw rod 36 and is inserted through a hole 38 in structure 11 of the sheet metal or other material of limited thickness, with the head 15 and flanged portion 16 bearing against the visible or upper face of structure 11. A non rotatable anvil 40 Fig. 4 is inserted over the draw rod 36 and bears against the head 15 of fastener 10 as an upward tension is applied to the draw rod 36. The longitudinal pressure in the direction of the head at off set 26 will be centered at about the mid point of the thickness of the wall in the portion of the reduced thickness 27. As upward tension is exerted the shank 21 will be caused to fold outwardly in the location of the off set 26.As the draw rod 36 is moved upwardly, the shank will be upset or buckle until such buckled portion designated 41 Fig. 3 is applied firmly against the blind surface 42 of the structure through which it is installed. Thereafter the sheet metal structure 11 directly in line with the bore 30 of the laterally extending flanged portion 16 is drilled through and rivet 45 is inserted therein. A suitable rivet upsetting tool or rivet gun 46 is used to upset rivet 45 effecting a bulging of the bottom portion 48 of the rivet 45 with its tapered head 49 firmly seated within the recessed or the chamfered portion 31 of the upper end portion of bore 30. The blind fastener 10 is now ready for receiving a screw to secure an external component to the structure 11 which can be firmly secured and torqued. Various modifications are contemplated and may obviously be resorted to by those skilled in the art without departing from the described invention, as hereinafter defined by the appended claims, as only a preferred embodiment thereof has been disclosed.
