# LOW RESISTANCE OHMIC CONTACTS TO N TYPE GROUP III V SEMICONDUCTORS

## Abstract
A low resistance ohmic contact to a layer 6 of n type GaAs is made by first vapour depositing layers 8, 10, 12 of Ni, Au and Ge on the GaAs, followed by a layer 14 of SiOâ‚‚. This structure is heated to a temperature of 450 C within ten seconds and the structure is maintained at that temperature for 30 seconds to form an alloy ohmic contact. The structure is then rapidly cooled by applying a heat sink 20 to the back surface 5 of the substrate 2 supporting the GaAs layer 6 . The technique may be used to form ohmic contacts to other n type Group III V semiconductors. Ohmic contacts formed using this method exhibit a very fine, high density, uniform granular structure.
