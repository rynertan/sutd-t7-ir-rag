# Image generating apparatus for producing from the co ordinates of the end points of a line, a two dimensional image depicting the line as viewed by the observer.

## Abstract
In a simulator for producing two dimensional images of objects whose shapes are defined by three dimensional co ordinates recorded in a memory it is necessary to project the three dimensional co ordinates recorded in the memory e.g. co ordinates x7, y7, z7, x8, y8, z8 and x9, y9, z9 onto an image plane y D will be as shown by the square outline on Figure 4. For the point x8, y8, z8 and x9, y9, z9, which are in front of the observer who is assumed to be at the origin in the illustrated situation, this projection process is relatively straightforward and results in the co ordinates x11, z11 and x12, z12 in the plane y D. When however the co ordinates x8, y8, z8 and x9, y9, z9 are the vertices of a triangle having another vertex behind the observer, e.g. as shown at x7, y7, z7 the aforementioned projection process cannot be applied to the last mentioned vertex. In accordance with the invention a line joining x7, y7, z7 to the origin is extrapolated so as to intersect the plane y D at a point x10, z10 and the lines joining this point x10, z10 to the points x11, z11 and x12, z12 are also extrapolated by an amount so that they intersect the bottom edge of the image plane at points x13, z13, and x14, z14. The quadrelateral defined by the points x11, z11, x12, z12, x13, z13, and x14, z14 is found to depict correctly the three dimensional triangle defined by the vertices x7, y7, z7, x8, y8, z8, and x9, y9, z9. The quadrelateral may, for convenience of processing be divided into two triangles as illustrated by the diagonal line on Figure 4.
