## Description
CASTELLATED SHEAVES MOULD AND PROCESS FORMANUFACTURING This invention relates to sheaves, and a mould and a process for the production and fabrication of sheaves, and more particularly to castellated sheaves and a twopiece mould for forming such sheaves, which open by relative movement of one piece with respect to the other along a predetermined axis. The mould and the process as described herein, results in an integrally formed castellated sheave which is preferably moulded of a material such as various plastics, hard rubber and the like. The castellated sheave which is produced by the mould and process of this invention includes a cylindrical or disk shaped body member having a longitudinal axis, wherein rotation of the sheave takes place around the longitudinal axis.A first and second array of segments extend radially from the circumferential surface of the cylindrical shaped member to define a circumferential groove or trough for receiving a belt. The non overlapping and integrally moulded spaced arrangement of these first and second arrays around the cylindrical base member forms the castellated appearance of the sheave. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, sheaves which work in combination with a flexible belt are well known and used extensively in the mechanical arts. However, the use and advantages of castellated sheaves is not believed to be known, and certainly a mould and moulding process for manufacturing such castellated sheaves as a unitary plastic device is not known. In the prior art, plastic sheaves were either moulded by forming two disk shaped sections which were then joined and bonded axially, or the sheave was formed as a unitary unit by two moulded halves which opened in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the sheave and each of which formed a semi circular portion or 1800 of the sheave. Simple axial opening moulds which form the complete sheave have not been possible heretofore because of the circumferential belt trough or groove which must be formed. As is known in the art, the circumferential typically V or trapezoidal shaped grooves must be deep enough so that the belt cannot bottom outOtherwise the belt will slip in the groove. It is important to note that such vt. shaped belts are totally dependent on the frictional contact between the sides of the belt and the sides of the V t groove. Therefore it is an object of this invention to provide a sheave which can transmit the normal forces between the sheave and a cooperating belt greater than the forces transmitted by a normal frictional contact. It is also an object of this invention to provide a sheave which does not become substantially inoperative if the cooperating belt bottoms out in the V groove It is a further object of this invention to provide a sheave which can be manufactured as a unitary item in a simple axially opening mould by injection moulding. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a mould and process for forming castellated sheaves integrally formed with a hub member which defines an aperture therethrough. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a mould and moulding process for forming a castellated sheave wherein first and second arrays of segments extend radially from, and around the circumferential surface of a base member. Other objects and advantages will be obvious, and will in part appear hereinafter, and will be accomplished by the present invention which provides a reusable mould and moulding process for integrally forming a unique castellated sheave from a selected material. The formed castellated sheave includes a disk shaped or cylindrical base member having a longitudinal rotational axis, and the disk shaped base member is integrally joined with first and second arrays of segments. Each of the segments of the firstand second arrays extend radially from the cylindrical member and in combination form a circumferential groove or trough around the cylindrical base member.The reusable mould operates or opens along a centre axis corresponding to the longitudinal rotational axis. A first section forms a portion of the disk shaped or cylindrical member of the sheave, and further defines the outside surfaces of half of the castellating segments and the inside surfaces of the other half of segments. These segments are disposed coaxially around the centre of rotational axis and extend radially from the cylindrical surface of the base member. A second section of the mould similar to the first section, which is adapted for reciprocating movement along the centre axis between an open and close position with respect to the first section also forms a portion of the sheave base member as well as the surfaces of the castellated segments not formed by the first mould sections.Thus, the two sections of the mould cooperate such that when they are in a closed position, the sections define in combination a substantially enclosed cavity corresponding to the desired castellated sheave. In addition, at least one of the first and second sections define a sprue, gate or port which extends from the enclosed cavity to the outside of the mould such that moulding material may be transferred to the inside of the mould to fill the cavity and form the castellated sheave. In operation, the two sections open and close by axial movement with respect to each other such that the castellated sheave formed in the cavity may be removed by moving at least one of the sections along the centre axis to the open position. In a preferred embodiment, the mould further includes means for receiving and supporting a central hub member made of another material such as metal which is positioned coaxially, with the centre axis and has a selected cross section which is smaller than the diameter of the cylindrical surface of the base member.Typically, the central hub member extends the full longitudinal distance of the sheave such that when the moulded sheave is removed from the mould, an aperture extends completely through, and coaxially with the rotation axis of the sheave. Also in another preferred embodiment normally for slow rotational speed applications , the defined aperture through the cylindrical base member is noncircular and may preferably be square or hexagonal in shape. Embodiments of the invention will be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig 1 is a perspective view of a castellated sheave incorporating the teachings of this invention. Fig 2 is a side view of the castellated sheave of Fig 1 and further includes a flexible V belt cooperating therewith. Fig 2A is a cross section of the castellated sheave and belt of Fig 2. Fig 2B is top view of the castellated sheave and belt of Fig 2 and shows deformation of the V belt as it rides between the segments forming the belt trough. Fig 2C and 2D show alternate embodiments of castellations. Fig 3 shows an alternate embodiment of a castellated sheave similar to Fig 1, but includes a metal hub. Fig 4 is a cross section of the sheave of Fig 3 showing details of the metal hub and method of using an angled set screw to hold the key in position. Fig 5 shows a perspective view of an injection mould suitable for forming the castellated sheave ofFig 1. Figs 6A and 6B show a side view of the mould ofFig 5B in the open and closed positions respectively. Fig 7 discloses a block flow diagram showing the method of this invention and using a mould of this invention. Fig 8 is an alternate embodiment of the sheave ofFig 1 showing a square hub or axial opening. Referring now to Fig 1, there is shown generally at 20 a perspective view of a castellated sheave incorporating the teachings of this invention. As shown, sheave 20 includes a substantially disk shaped body member 22 having a central hub portion 24 and a rim portion 26. Although the disk shaped body member 22 could be substantially solid, the embodiment shown inFig 1 includes four spoke members 28, 30, 32 and 34 which support the rim portion 26 with respect to the hub 24. It will further be appreciated of course that for purposes of added strength and ease in forming moulds that the number of spokes could be greater or smaller than the four spokes shown in Fig 1. In one preferred embodiment, hub 24 defines a circular aperture with a key way 36 formed therein.As will be discussed in more detail hereinafter, the aperture formed by hub 24 is suitable for receiving a circular shaft of approximately the same diameter in combination with a key way and key not shown . It will also be appreciated that the disk shaped body 22 and the sheave 20 in general has a longitudinal axis 38 on which the sheave rotates. Of course, when a drive shaft and keyway are used with the sheave 20, the rotational axis of the sheave and the longitudinal axis of the drive shaft will be coaxial. Rim portion 26 which is supported by the spokes 28, 30, 32 and 34 defines an outside or circumferential base surface 40 with which there is integrally formed first and second arrays of wedgeshaped segments.Each of the segments of the first array are angularly spaced one from the other around circumferential base 40 as indicated by arcuate angles 42 and 44 which arcuate angles represent angular spacing between segments 46, 48 and 50. Also as shown, the first array of segments which includes segments 46, 48 and 50 are located near the edge 52 of circumferential base surface 40. That is, the first array of segments are positioned with respect to a selected first location 54 along the longitudinal axis 38. In a similar manner, the second array of segments which includes segments 56, 58 and 60, are located at a second location 62 along longitudinal axis 38 such the first and second arrays are axially spaced from each other. The segments of the second arrays are also angular spaced one from the other in the same manner as were the segments of the first array. However as will be appreciated from the detailed discussion hereinafter, the size and arrangement of the second array is such that the segments of one array are staggered with respect to the segments of the other array, and in a preferred embodiment suitable for moulding with a simple two piece mould, none of the second array of segments overlap any of the segments in the first array.It is also worthwhile to note that the wedge shape of the segments of both first and second arrays in the embodiment of Fig 1 results in a circumferential groove having a substantial trapezoidal cross sectional shape between the first and second arrays. It is this staggered segment arrangement that results in the castellated appearance of the sheave. It will further be appreciated by those skilled in the art that although the segments of both the first and second arrays as shown in Fig 1 are all of substantially the same size such similarity of size is not necessary. It will further be appreciated and shown in detail hereinafter, that although the segments of a first array do not overlap with the segments of a second array, the spacing between segments and the size of the individual segments are substantially the same.However, it will be appreciated, that a sheave incorporating the teachings of this invention can include a spacing between segments as indicated by double headed arrow 64 extending between segments 46 and 48 which is greater than the length of the segment such as indicated by arrow 66 extending across the base of segment 60. Similarly, there may be circumstances under which the length 66 of a segment may overlap or be greater than the distance between cooperating segments as indicated by double headed arrow 64. As will become more clear in detail hereinafter, however, although a castellated sheave incorporating the teachings of this invention may be included wherein the segments of the first array do overlap with segments of the second array, such an embodiment cannot be formed by the preferred moulding technique as also discussed hereinafter. Referring now to Fig 2, there is shown a side view of the sheave of Fig 1 cooperating with a flexible V belt 68. To avoid confusion, and assist in the understanding of the present invention, those portions of the sheave 20 of Fig 2, which are the same as identical portions of the sheave of Fig 1, will carry common reference numbers.As can be seen in Fig 2, flexible V belt 68 extends around the circumference of the sheave 20 in the trapezoidal or V shaped groove formed between the first array of segments which includes segments 46, 48 and 50 and a second array of segments which includes segments 56, 58 and 60 not shown . As shown in Fig 2 and more particularly in the Fig 2A which is a cross section ofFig 2, the V belt 68 has a trapezoidal shape corresponding to the trapezoidal shape of the circumferential groove, but has a larger cross section such that unless belt 68 deforms as discusses hereinafter the bottom surface 70 of the belt cannot contact the circumferential surface 40. Thus as shown, there is a circumferential gap 72 extending around the sheave between the surface 40 and the bottom 70 of the belt 68. The gap 72 shown in the embodiment of Figs 2 and 2A, is essential to proper operation of prior art sheaves and pulleys and V belts. However, referring to Fig 2B which is a top view of the V belt and the sheave combination of Fig 2, the formation of the gap 72 between the bottom 70 of the V belt 68 and the circumferential surface 40, is not essential for the operation of the sheave of this invention and a V belt. As can be seen in Fig 2B, the resilience of the flexible V belt 68 may be designed to allow the belt to take a serpentine shape exaggerated in Fig 2B between the alternating or staggered segments such as the serpentine shape shown between segments 56, 50, 58, 48 and 60.Thus, it will appreciated that although even with the sheave of the present invention, it is often desirable that the flexibleV belt 68 does not bottom out or come in contact with the circumferential surface 40, under certain circumstances, driving power may still be maintained between the belt and sheave even when such contact or bottoming out occurs. Furthermore, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that by selection of a belt having sufficient flexibility to allow the belt to take such a serpentine shape may well result in greater power transmission qualities than previous sheave and V belt combinations, whether or not the V belt 68 bottoms out.It is believed that the serpentine shape and the resulting forces experienced between the belt 68 and the edges of the segments such as edge 74 when the belt moves as indicated by arrow 75 will result in greater power transmission quality than available on present sheaves and V belt transmission systems. As shown by dotted lines having reference numbers 77A and 77B in Fig. 2, the outside edge of the castellat ions may include rounded corners to minimize sharp edges. Also as illustrated in Figs. 2C and 2D, the number and shape of the castellation may be varied as desired. Such castellated shaped may be readily moulded with the moulds and moulding technique taught by the present invention. Referring now to Fig. 3, there is shown another embodiment of a castellated sheave incorporating the features of this invention. As shown, the hub area 76 is larger than that shown in the sheave of Fig. 1.According to this embodiment, and as can be more clearly seen in Fig. 4 which is a cross sectional view of Fig.3, portion 76 includes a metal hub member 78. Thus in injection forming the sheave of Fig. 3, the sheave portion is injection moulded around metal hub 78. To increase the bonding strength between the metal hub 78 and the sheave, metal hub 78 includes a serrated surface 80. The sheave of Fig. 3 which includes the metal hub 78 will be found to have particular application with sheaves wherein substantial torque must be transmitted between the sheave and a circular power shaft 82. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a keyway such as keyway 36 of Fig. 1 in an injection moulded plastic sheave for purposes of driving large torques by metal shaft 82 could fail by rounding off of the plastic keyway edges. Thus, the use of a metal hub 78 would overcome this deficiency for sheaves transmitting large torque values.Referring again to Fig. 4, it will be seen that the key 84 setting in keyway 86 of shaft 82 and the keyway 88 of metal hub 78 is held in position by a set screw 90 which extends from the face 92 of hub 78 to the keyway 86 at an angle. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a set screw for maintaining a key locked in a keyway between a power shaft and a hub, will normally extend along a line perpendicular to the rotational axis of the power shaft.However, it is believed the angular position as shown in this embodiment is superior for plastic sheaves having metal hubs so that none of the bonding surface between the hub and the plastic sheave must be sacrificed to allow for the set screw. Referring now to Fig. 5, 6A and 6B, there is shown a metal mould suitable for injection moulding the sheave of Fig. 1. As was the case with respect to common portions of the plastic sheaves discussed in the various figures heretofore, common portions of the mould as shown in Figs. 5, 6A and 6B will carry common reference numbers.As shown, the mould of Figs. 5, 6A and 6B include a first mould half 100A and a second mould half lOOB. As will be discussed hereinafter, mould halves 100A and 100B will be mounted on a machine such that reciprocating motion along longitudinal axis 102 will allow the mould halves to open and close. Figs. 6A and 6B respectively show the mould halves in the open, position. For purposes of mounting the two mould halves, mould half 100B is shown to include support bars 104 and 106 each of which include mounting holes for mounting to the injection machine. In a somewhat similar manner, mould half 100A includes a flange 108 which itself includes bolt or mounting holes 110,112 and 114. Thus, it will be appreciated that by relative motion between the two mould halves along the longitudinal axis 102, the protruding portion 116 of mould half 100A will be received by the recess 118 in mould half 100B. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the injection moulding art, and as is shown more clearly in mould half 100A of Fig. 5, the castellated sheave 20 of Fig. 1 may be formed by the mould of Figs. 5, 6A and 6B. In particular, it will be appreciated that mould half 100A forms a portion of the disk shape or cylindrical member 22 of the sheave and defines the outside surface of a first half of the castellating segments and the inside surface of the other or second half of the segments. In a similar manner, the mould half 100B will define the inside surface of the first half of the castellating segments and the outside surface of the second half of the castellating segments.Further, in the embodiment shown, a circular aperture with keyway 36 will be formed during the injection moulding process by protruding member 119 on mould half 100A. Alternately a protruding member similar to 119 may be used to carry a centre metal hub during moulding for producing sheaves such as shown in Figs.3 and 4. In a similar manner, the openings or apertures defined between the spokes 28,30, 32 and 34 will be defined by protruding members 120, 122, 124 and 126 respectively. It will also be appreciated and as is more clearly seen in Fig. 6B that the two sections of the mould cooperate such that when they are in the closed position the castellating portions of the two mould halves 100A and IOOB are maintained at a selected spacing such that when filled with a selected moulding material they will form a castellated sheave similar to that shown in Fig. 1. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, injection moulding requires some way for the selected material to be moved from outside the mould to the interior cavity of the mould where the item is to be formed. To accomplish this there is shown a gate, port or sprue 130 having a passageway 132 defined in mould half 100B which extends from the top surface 134 of mould half 100B to the interior of the mould and further passageway 132 joins with the internal cavity. Thus, the selected hot liquid or moulding material may be injected from the outside of the mould to completely fill the interior cavity formed by the two halves of the mould when they are in the closed position. Although the sprue 130 and passageway 132 are shown as being totally in mould half 100B, it will be appreciated that this location is indicative only and, therefore, a gate and passageway could alternately also be located in mould half 100A or any other location. To those skilled in the art, it will be appreciated that either a single one of a port or gate, or alternately additional ports may be used in a particular mould depending upon requirements of the mould, such as size, the cooling available, and the type of injection moulding materials used. Referring now to Fig. 7, there is shown a processing system for manufacturing the castellated sheave of this invention and using the particular mould of this invention. As represented by double headed arrow 136, the mould halves 138 and 140 are supported by structures 142 and 144 so that the mould halves can be moved to the closed position along the centre axis 102 so that the desired cavity is formed by the two halves as discussed heretofore. The selected material from which the resulting device is made is injected from source 146 by means of piston 148 into the mould through port 150 to the interior of the cavity at a selected temperature and pressure to completely fill the cavity and form the resulting castellated sheave.It will be appreciated that the mould may require additional cooling as indicated by coils 152, and that temperature and pressures at which the selected material is injected into the mould may vary depending upon the material used. Further, although substantially any type of plastics or curing material may be used it is expected that a particularly preferable product may be obtained by using selected thermal materials such as various hard rubbers, polyethylene, polyurethane, polyproplylene and the like. Once the material has been injected and completely fills the cavity, and the material has been allowed to cool and cure to a point where it will retain its desired shape, the two halves of the mould 138 and 140 are then opened with respect to each other along the centre axis 102 and the resulting castellated sheave ejected. Referring now to Fig. 8 there is shown an alternate embodiment of a castellated sheave of this invention, incorporating the further features of a non circular or square axial aperture 154 for cooperating with a square drive shaft. As will be appreciated the use of such a non circular drive aperture, although normally used for slow speed rotational applications, will eliminate the need of keys, keyways and set screws while still permitting positive drive. It will also be appreciated that other non circular apertures such as hexagon, oval etc. will also allow for positive drive without requiring keys and keyways. It is also of importance to note and understand that although the previous discussion on injecting molding the castellated sheave of this invention was with respect to a plastic sheave, the alternate castellated sheave having a metal hub may also be formed by placing the desired metal hub into the cavity prior to the injection of the molding material. It will of course be appreciated that the aperture for receiving the power drive shaft must be sealed so that the injection molding material does not also fill the drive aperture. Thus, although there has been described to this point particular embodiments of the mold and process of molding castellated sheaves it is not intended that such specific references be considered as limitations on the invention except insofar as such limitations are included in the following claims.
