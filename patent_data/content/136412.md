## Description
METHOD FOR REDUCING SURFACE MELT FRACTURE DURING EXTRUSION OF ETHYLENE POLYMERS This invention relates to a method for reducing melt fracture, particularly surface melt fracture, during extrusion of a molten narrow molecular weight distribution, linear. ethylene copolymer. under conditions of flow rate and melt temperature which would otherwise produce such melt fracture. Most commercial low density polyethylenes are polymerized in heavy walled autoclaves or tubular reactors at pressures as high as 50,000 psi and temperatures up to 3000C. The molecular structure of high pressure low density polyethylene is highly complex. The permutations in the arrangement of its simple building blocks are essentially infinite. High pressure resins are characterized by an intricate long chain branched molecular architecture. These long chain branches have a dramatic effect on the melt rheology of the resins. High pressure low density polyethylene resins also possess a spectrum of short chain branches generally 1 to 6 carbon atoms in length which control resin crystallinity density . The frequency distribution of these short chain branches is such that, on the average, most chains possess the same average number of branches.The short chain branching distribution characterizing high pressure low density polyethylene can be considered narrow. Low density polyethylene can exhibit a multitude of properties. It is flexible and has a good balance of mechanical properties such as tensile strength, impact resistance, burst strength, and tear strength. In addition, it retains its strength down to relatively low temperatures.Certain resins do not embrittle at temperatures as low as 70 C. Low density polyethylene has good chemical resistance. and it is relatively inert to acids. alkalis, and inorganic solutions. It is, however, sensitive to hydrocarbons. halogenated hydrocarbons. and to oils and greases. Low density polyethylene has excellent dielectric strength. More than 50S of all low density polyethylene is processed into film. This film is primarily utilized in packaging applications such as for meat, produce. frozen food, ice bags, boilable pouches, textile and paper products, rack merchandise. industrial liners. shipping sacks.pallet stretch and shrink wrap. Large quantities of wide heavy gauge film are used in construction and agriculture. Most low density polyethylene film is produced by the tubular blown film extrusion process. Film products made by this process range in size. from tubes which are about two inches or less in diameter. and which are used as sleeves or pouches. to huge bubbles that provide a lay flat of up to about twenty feet in width. and which, when slit along an edge and opened up, will measure up to about forty feet in width. Polyethylene can also be produced at low to medium pressures by homopolymerizing ethylene or copolymerizing ethylene with various alpha olefins using heterogeneous catalysts based on transition metal compounds of variable valence. These resins generally possess little, if any, long chain branching and the only branching to speak of is short chain branching. Branch length is controlled by comonomer type. Branch frequency is controlled by the concentration of comonomer s used during copolymerization. Branch frequency distribution is influenced by the nature of the transition metal catalyst used during the copolymerization process.The short chain branching distribution characterizing transition metal catalyzed low density polyethylene can be very broad. Linear low density polyethylene can also be produced by high pressure techniques as is well known in the art. U.S. Patent 4,302,566 in the names ofF.J.Karol et al and entitled Preparation of EthyleneCopolymers in Fluid Bed Reactor, discloses that ethylene copolymers, having a density of 0.91 to 0.96, a melt flow ratio of greater than or equal to 22 to less than or equal to 32 and a relatively low residual catalyst content can be produced in granular form, at relatively high productivities if the monomer s are copolymerized in a gas phase process with a specific high activity Mg Ti containing complex catalyst which is blended with an inert carrier material. U. S. Patent 4,302,565 in the names of G.L.Goeke et al and entitled Impregnated PolymerizationCatalyst, Process for Preparing, and Use forEthylene Copolymerization discloses that ethylene copolymers, having a density of 0.91 to 0.96. a melt flow ratio of greater than or equal to 22 to less than or equal to 32 and a relatively low residual catalyst content can be produced in granular form, at relatively high productivities, if the monomer s are copolymerized in a gas phase process with a specific high activity Mg Ti containing complex catalyst which is impregnated in a porous inert carrier material. The polymers as produced, for example, by the processes of said applications using the Mg Ti containing complex catalyst possess a narrow molecular weight distribution, Mw Mn, of about greater than or equal to 2.7 or less than or equal to 4.1.Low Density Polyethylene Theology The rheology of polymeric materials depends to a large extent on molecular weight and molecular weight distribution. In film extrusion, two aspects of rheological behavior are important shear and extension. Within a film extruder and extrusion die. a polymeric melt undergoes severe shearing deformation. As the extrusion screw pumps the melt to, and through, the film die, the melt experiences a wide range of shear rates. Most film extrusion processes are thought to expose the melt to shear at rates in the 100 5000 sex 1 range. Polymeric melts are known to exhibit what is commonly termed shear thinning behavior, i.e., non Newtonian flow behavior. As shear rate is increased. viscosity the ratio of shear stress. x, to shear rate, decreases.The degree of viscosity decrease depends upon the molecular weight, its distribution and molecular configuration, i.e. long chain branching of the polymeric material. Short chain branching has little effect on shear viscosity. In general, high pressure low density polyethylenes have a broad molecular weight distribution and show enhanced shear thinning behavior in the shear rate range common to film extrusion. The narrow molecular weight distribution resins used in the present invention exhibit reduced shear thinning behavior at extrusion grade shear rates. The consequences of these differences are that the narrow distribution resins used in the present invention require higher power and develop higher pressures during extrusion than the high pressure low density polyethylene resins of broad molecular weight distribution and of equivalent average molecular weight. The rheology of polymeric materials is customarily studied in shear deformation. In simple shear, the velocity gradient of the deforming resin is perpendicular to the flow direction. The mode of deformation is experimentally convenient but does not convey the essential information for understanding material response in film fabrication processes.As one can define a shear viscosity in terms of shear stress and shear rate, i.e. shear T 12 where TI shear shear viscosity poise T 12 shear stress dynes ci2 X shear rate sec 1 an extensional viscosity can be defined in terms of normal stress and strain rate, i.e., ext n ext extensional viscosity poise IT normal stress dynes cm2 c strain rate sec l During extrusion of high a molecular weight ethylene polymer having a narrow molecular weight distribution through dies. as with other such polymeric materials, melt fracture occurs when the extrusion rate exceeds a certain critical value. Melt Fracturen is a general term used by the polymer industry to describe a variety of extrudate irregularities observed during extrusion of molten polymers. The occurrence of melt fracture severely limits the rate at which acceptable products can be fabricated under commercial conditions The occurrence of melt fracture was first described by Nason in 1945 and since then several investigators have studied this in an attempt to understand the underlying mechanism s for its occurrence. C.J.S. Petrie and M.M. Denn Amer. Inst. Chem Engrs. Journal. Vol. 22, pages 209 236, 1976 have presented a critical review of the literature which indicates that the present understanding of the mechanism s leading to melt fracture is far from complete. The melt fracture characteristics of a molten polymer is usually studied using a capillary rheometer. The polymer at a given temperature is forced through a capillary die of known dimensions at a given flow rate. The pressure required is noted and the emerging extrudate is examined for surface characteristics. The extrudate surface characteristics of linear low density polyethylene LLDPE resins. as determined with a capillary rheometer are typical of many linear narrow distribution polymers. They indicate that at low shear stresses less than approximately 20 psi , the emerging extrudates from a capillary die are smooth and glossy. At a critical shear stress approximately 20 22 psi . the extrudates exhibit loss of surface gloss. The loss of gloss is due to fine scale roughness of the extrudate surface which can be perceived under a microscope at a moderate magnification 20 40X .This condition represents the onset of surface irregularities and occurs at a critical shear stress in the die. Above the critical stress, two main types of extrudate melt fracture can be identified with LLDPE resins surface melt fracture and gross melt fracture. The surface melt fracture occurs over a shear stress range of approximately 10 65 psi and results in increasing severity of surface roughness. In its most severe form, it appears as sharkskin. The surface irregularities occur under apparently steady flow conditions. That is, no fluctuation in either the pressure or the flow rate is observed. At a shear stress of approximately 65 psi, the flow becomes unsteady when both the pressure and the flow rate fluctuate between two extremes and the emerging extrudates correspondingly exhibit smooth and rough surfaces.This is the onset of gross melt fracture and has been a subject of intense investigation by several investigator because of its severity. With further increase in shear stress, the extrudates become totally distorted and show no regularity. Several mechanisms have been proposed in the literature for the occurrence of surface and gross melt fracture. Surface melt fracture of the surface type has been proposed to be due to effects at the die exit where the viscoelastic melt is subjected to high local stresses as it parts company with the die surface. This leads to cyclic build up and release of surface tensile forces at the die exit resulting in the observed surface melt fracture. Another mechanism for surface melt fracture proposes differential recovery, due to the elasticity between the skin and core of the extrudate as a primary cause. On the other hand, gross melt fracture has been proposed to be due to die land and or die entry effects.The proposed mechanisms include slip stick in the die land region tearing of the melt in the die entry region due to exceeding the melt strength and. propagation of spiralling flow instabilities in the die entry region. Under commercial film fabrication conditions shear stress range approximately 25 65 psi with conventional blown film dies. predominately surface melt fracture of the sharkskin type occurs with LLDPE resins resulting in commercially unacceptable products. There are several methods for eliminating surface melt fracture under commercial film fabrication conditions. These are aimed at reducing the shear stresses in the die and include increasing the melt temperature modifying the die geometry and use of slip additives in the resin to reduce friction at the wall. Increasing the melt temperature is not commercially useful since it lowers the rate for film formation due to bubble instabilities and heat transfer limitations.Another method for eliminating surface melt fracture is described in U.S. Patent 3,920,782. In this method, surface melt fracture formed during extrusion of polymeric materials is controlled or eliminated by cooling an outer layer of the material so it emerges from the die with a reduced temperature while maintaining the bulk of the melt at the optimum working temperature. However, this method is difficult to employ and control. The invention of U.S. Patent 3.920.782 is apparently based on the inventor s conclusions that the onset of surface melt fracture under his operating conditions with his resins is a function, basically of exceeding a critical linear velocity with his resins through his dies at his operating temperatures. In the process of the present invention. however, the onset of surface melt fracture in the present applicant s resins under his operating conditions is a function, primarily of exceeding a critical shear stress. U.S. Patent 3,382,535 discloses a means for designing dies which are to be used for the high speed extrusion coating of wire and cable with plastic materials such as polypropylene, high density and low density polyethylene together with their copolymers, which are responsive, or sensitive, to the taper angles of the extrusion die. The dies of this patent are designed to avoid gross melt fracture of the extruded plastic wire coating which is encountered at significantly higher stresses than that for surface melt fracture encountered during film formation. The invention of U.S. Patent 3,382,535 resides in the designing of the taper angle of the die entry so as to provide a curvilinear die configuration FIGS. 6 and 7 of the patent which converges in the direction of flow of the resin.This procedure. however, of. in effect, decreasing the taper angle of the die, will result in an increase in the critical shear rate of the resin processed through the die. This reduces gross distortions as a function only of the angle of entry in and or to the die. Surface melt fracture is insensitive to taper angles at the die entry and the present invention relates to reducing surface melt fracture as a function of the land length and die lip configuration. U.S.Patent 3,879,507 discloses a means of reducing melt fracture during the extrusion of foamable composition into film or sheet. This method involves increasing the length of the die land and or slightly tapering the die gap. while retaining or decreasing the die gap, which is apparently to be relatively narrow1 as compared to the prior art see column 4, lines 2 6 and of the order of 0.025 inches or 25 mils column 5, line 10 . This kind of melt fracture is produced by premature bubble formation at the surface. This melt fracture, however, is totally different than the melt fracture experienced in processing LLDPE resins for film formation. In other words, the melt fracture is not as a result of rheological properties as discussed herein.Die modifications are designed to reduce the shear stress in the die land region to be below the critical stress level approximately 20 psi by either enlarging the die gap U. S. Patents 4,243,619 and 4.282,177 or heating the die lip to temperatures significantly above the melt temperature. Enlarging the die gap results in thick extrudates which must be drawn down and cooled in the film blowing process. While LLDPE resins have excellent drawdown characteristics, thick extrudates increase the molecular orientation in the machine direction and results in directional imbalance and reduction in critical film properties such as tear resistance. Also, thick extrudates limit the efficiency of conventional bubble cooling systems which result in reduced rates for stable operation. The wide gap technology has other disadvantages.The required gap is a function of extrusion rate, resin melt index and melt temperature. The wide gap configuration is not suitable for processing conventional Low DensityPolyethylene HP LDPE resins. Thus. die gap changes are required to accommodate the flexibility expected by the fabricator with a given line. The heated lip concept is aimed at reducing stresses at the die exit and involves extensive modifications requiring efficient insulation of the hot lips from the rest of the die and from the air ring. U.S. Patent 3.125.547 discloses a polyolefin composition involving the addition of a fluorocarbon polymer to provide improved extrusion characteristics and melt fracture free extrudates at high extrusion speeds. This is based on the inventor s conclusion that the slip stick phenomenon at high extrusion speed and the resulting herring bone pattern on the extrudate surface are due to poor lubrication at the die orifice. The use of the fluorocarbon polymer is intended to promote lubrication and reduce the stresses involved to obtain melt fracture free extrudates. The practice of U.S. Patent 3,125,547 drastically reduces the stresses with dies constructed from conventional materials which, apparently suggests a modification of the rheological properties of the polyolefin resin due to the presence of the fluorocarbon polymer.The process of the present invention, involving a die geometry modification achieves melt fracture reduction without significantly affecting the rheological properties of the resin. U.S. Patent 4,342,848 discloses the use ofPolyvinyloctadecyl Ether as a processing modifier to obtain smoother surface of the extrudates and improved film properties with high density polyethylene resins. This additive, however, was found to be unsuitable for melt fracture reduction with LLDPE resins. Additives for use as processing aids to obtain melt fracture reduction in extrudates, are expensive and the added cost. depending on the required concentration. may be prohibitive in resins, such as LLDPE. intended for commodity applications. Additives influence the rheological properties of the base resin and, in excess amounts.may adversely affect critical film properties including gloss, transparency, blocking and heat sealability characteristics of the product. In the method of the present invention, melt fracture. particularly surface melt fracture.can be reduced by changes in the die i.e., by extruding the narrow molecular weight distribution ethylene polymer at normal film extrusion temperatures through a die wherein the ratio of the length of the die land to the width of the die gap is about 20 1 to about 50 1 preferably about 35 1 to about 45 1 and wherein the die lips forming the die exit are arc shaped and approximate a portion of a circle having a radius of about 1 128 to about 1 64 inch, preferably about 1 32 inch to 1 16 inch. The utility of the present invention arises as a result of the discovery that the primary mechanism for the onset of melt fracture in LLDPE resins is the initiation of slip of polymer melt at the die wall. In the present invention, it has been found that use of a long die land. in combination with the contoured die lips reduces melt fracture during film fabrication of LLDPE resins with narrow die gaps at commercial rates. Films suitable for packaging applications must possess a balance of key properties for broad end use utility and wide commercial acceptance.These properties include film optical quality, for example. haze, gloss, and see through characteristics. Mechanical strength properties such as puncture resistance, tensile strength, impact strength. stiffness. and tear resistance are important. Vapor transmission and gas permeability characteristics are important considerations in perishable goods packaging. Performance in film converting and packaging equipment is influenced by film properties such as coefficient of friction, blocking, heat sealability and flex resistance. Low density polyethylene has a wide range of utility such as in food packaging and non food packaging applications. Bags commonly produced from low density polyethylene include shipping sacks. textile bags. laundry and dry cleaning bags and trash bags. Low density polyethylene film can be used as drum liners for a number of liquid and solid chemicals and as protective wrap inside wooden crates. Low density polyethylene film can be used in a variety of agricultural and horticultural applications such as protecting plants and crops, as mulching. for storing of fruits and vegetables. Additionally. low density polyethylene film can be used in building applications such as a moisture or moisture vapor barrier. Further. low density polyethylene film can be coated and printed for use in newspapers. books, etc. Possessing a unique combination of the aforedescribed properties, high pressure low density polyethylene is the most important of the thermoplastic packaging films. It accounts for about 508 of the total usage of such films in packaging. Films made from the polymers of the present invention, preferably the ethylene hydrocarbon copolymers, offer an improved combination of end use properties and are especially suited for many of the applications already served by high pressure low density polyethylene. An improvement in any one of the properties of a film such as elimination or reduction of surface melt fracture or an improvement in the extrusion characteristics of the resin or an improvement in the film extrusion process itself is of the utmost importance regarding the acceptance of the film as a substitute for high pressure low density polyethylene in many end use applications.Drawings FIG. 1 shows a cross section of the spiral spider annulus die of the present invention. FIG. 2 shows an enlarged cross section of a portion of a spiral die illustrating the contoured die lips and the extended die land. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method for reducing surface melt fracture during extrusion of a molten narrow molecular weight distribution, linear, ethylene polymer under conditions of flow rate and melt temperature which would otherwise produce such melt fracture which comprises extruding said polymer through a die having a die land and a die gap formed by opposing die lip surfaces, and wherein the ratio of the length of the die land to the die gap is within the range of about 20 1 to about 50 1 and preferably about 35 1 to about 45 1 said opposing die lips being arc shaped and approximating a portion of a circle having a radius of about 1 128 inch to 1 4 inch preferably about 1 32 inch to about 1 16 inch.DIES Advantageously. the molten ethylene polymer can be extruded through a die such as a spiral annular die. slit die. etc., preferably an annular die, having a narrow die gap greater than about 5 mils and preferably 5 40 mils. Advantageously, when processing LLDPE resins. it is no longer required to extrude the molten ethylene polymer through a die having a die gap of greater than about 50 mils as described in U.S. Patent 4.243.619. FIG. 1 is a cross sect onal view of a spiral spider annular die 10 through which the molten thermoplastic ethylene polymer is extruded to form a single layer film, tube or pipe. Die block 12 contains channels 14 for directing the polymer to the die exit. As the molten thermoplastic ethylene polymer is extruded. it spreads out as it passes into the die channels 14. Referring to FIG. 2, which is a portion of a cross section of a spiral die. there is indicated a spiral section A land entry section B and die landC. With reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, at the exit of the die, there is a die discharge outlet identified generally by reference numeral 16. The discharge outlet defines an exit die gap W which is formed by opposing surfaces of die lips 20 and 20 extending from opposing die land region surfaces 22 and 22 . The die lips are arc shaped contoured and define or approximate a portion of a circle having a radius R of about 1 128 to 1 4 inch, preferably about 1 32 to 1 16 inch. The die land C is of a length generally greater than most conventional die land lengths used in the art. According to the present invention, the ratio of the length of the die land C to the die gap 16 is within the range of about 20 1 to about 50 1 preferably about 35 1 to about 45 1. It has been found according to the present invention, that if this combination is employed i.e.. the greater die length of the die land long primary land and the contoured die lips, that melt fracture of the LLDPE resins is substantially reduced. This is believed to be due to the fact that the contoured die lip minimizes the stress discontinuities at the die exit and the long primary land minimizes the slip effects at the die wall. Advantageously, the materials of construction of the die can be conventional for the process of the invention to be commercially operable. It has been found, for example. that with a 45 mil die gap, contouring the die lip with a small radius 3 64 provides a significant reduction about 50 in melt fracture. In combination with a long primary land region. land length to gap ratio of about 45 1 substantial reduction up to 85 in melt fracture can be achieved with narrow die gaps for LLDPE resins. Film Extrusion I. Blown Film Extrusion The films formed as disclosed herein may be extruded by tubular blown film extrusion process. In this process a narrow molecular weight distribution polymer is melt extruded through an extruder. This extruder may have an extrusion screw therein with a length to diameter ratio of between 15 1 to 21 1, as described in U.S. Patent 4,343.755 in the names of John C. Miller et al and entitled WA Process For Extruding Ethylene Polymers, This application describes that this extrusion screw contains a feed, transition and metering section. Optionally, the extrusion screw can contain a mixing section such as that described in U.S.Patents 3.486.192 3.730.492 and 3.756.574. which are incorporated herein by reference. Preferably. the mixing section is placed at the screw tip. The extruder which may be used herein may have a 18 1 to 32 1 length to internal diameter barrel ratio. The extrusion screw used in the present invention may have a length to diameter ratio of 15 1 to 32 1. When, for example, an extrusion screw of a length to diameter ratio of 18 1 is used in a 24 1 extruder, the remaining space in the extrusion barrel can be partially filled with various types of plugs. torpedoes. or static mixers to reduce residence time of the polymer melt. The extrusion screw can also be of the type described in U.S. Patent 4.329,313. The molten polymer is then extruded through a die. as will hereinafter be described. The polymer is extruded at a temperature of about 1630C to about 2600C. The polymer is extruded in an upward vertical direction in the form of a tube although it can be extruded downward or even sideways. After extrusion of the molten polymer through the annular die, the tubular film is expanded to the desired extent, cooled, or allowed to cool and flattened. The tubular film is flattened by passing the film through a collapsing frame and a set of nip rolls. These nip rolls are driven, thereby providing means for withdrawing the tubular film away from the annular die. A positive pressure of gas, for example, air or nitrogen. is maintained inside the tubular bubble. As is known in the operation of conventional film processes. the pressure of the gas is controlled to give the desired degree of expansion to the tubular film. The degree of expansion. as measured by the ratio of the fully expanded tube circumference to the circumference of the die annulus. is in the range 1 1 to 6 1 and preferably. 1 1 to 4 1. The tubular extrudate is cooled by conventional techniques such as, by air cooling, water quench or mandrel. The drawdown characteristics of the polymers disclosed herein are excellent. Drawdown.defined as the ratio of the dip gap to the product of film gauge and blow up ratio. is kept less than about 250. Very thin gauge films can be produced at high drawdown from these polymers even when said polymer is highly contaminated with foreign particles and or gel. Thin gauge films of about 0.5 to 3.0 mils can be processed to exhibit ultimate elongations MD greater than about 400 to about 700 and TD greater than about 500 to about 700 . Furthermore, these films are not perceived as nsplitty . NSplittiness is a qualitative term which describes the notched tear response of a film at high deformation rates. Splittiness reflects crack propagation rate. It is an end use characteristic of certain types of film and is not well understood from a fundamental perspective. As the polymer exits the annulus die, the extrudate cools and its temperature falls below its melting point and it solidifies. The optical properties of the extrudate change as crystallization occurs and a frost line is formed.The position of this frost line above the annular die is a measure of the cooling rate of the film.This cooling rate has a very marked effect on the optical properties of the film produced herein. The ethylene polymer can also be extruded in the shape of a rod or other solid cross section using the same die geometry for only the external surface. Additionally, the ethylene polymer can also be extruded into pipe through annular dies.II. Slot Cast Film Extrusion The films formed as disclosed herein may also be extruded by slot cast film extrusion. This film extrusion method is well known in the art and comprises extruding a sheet of molten polymer through a slot die and then quenching the extrudate using, for example, a chilled casting roll or water bath. The die will hereinafter be described. In the chill roll process, film may be extruded horizontally and laid on top of the chill roll or it may be extruded downward and drawn under the chill roll. Extrudate cooling rates in the slot cast process are very high. Chill roll or water batch quenching is so fast that as the extrudate cools below its melting point. crystallites nucleate very rapidly, supramolecular structures have little time to grow and spherulites are held to a very small size.The optical properties of slot cast film are vastly improved over those characterizing films using the slower cooling rate, tubular blown film extrusion process. Compound temperatures in the slot cast film extrusion process generally run much higher than those typifying the tubular blown film process. Melt strength is not a process limitation in this film extrusion method. Both shear viscosity and extensional viscosity are lowered. Film can generally be extruded at higher output rates than practiced in the blown film process. The higher temperatures reduce shear stresses in the die and raise the output threshold for melt fracture.Film The film produced by the method of the present invention has a thickness of greater than about 0.10 mils to about 20 mils. preferably greater than about 0.10 to 10 mils, most preferably greater than about 0.10 to 4.0 mils. The 0.10 to 4.0 mil film is characterized by the following properties a puncture resistance value of greater than about 7.0 in lbs mil an ultimate elongation of greater than about 400 tensile impact strength of greater than about 500 to about 2000 ft lbs in3 and tensile strength greater than about 2000 to about 7000 psi. Various conventional additives such as slip agents. antiblocking agents. and antioxidants can be incorporated in the film in accordance with conventional practice.The Ethylene Polymers The polymers which may be used in the process of the present invention are homopolymers of ethylene or copolymers of a major mol percent greater than or equal to 80S of ethylene. and a minor mol percent less than or equal to 20 of one or more C3 to C8 alpha olefins. The C3 toC8 alpha olefins should not contain any branching on any of their carbon atoms which is closer than the fourth carbon atom. The preferred C3 to C8 alpha olefins are propylene, butene l, pentene l. hexener methylpentene l and octene 1. The ethylene polymers have a melt flow ratio of about greater than or equal to 22 to less than or equal to about 50, and preferably of about greater than or equal to 25 to less than or equal to 30. The melt flow ratio value is another means of indicating the molecular weight distribution of a polymer. The melt flow ratio MFR range of greater than or equal to 22 to less than or equal to 50 thus corresponds to a Mw Mn.value of about 2.7 to about 6.0. The homopolymers have a density of about greater than or equal to 0.958 to less than or equal to 0.972 and preferably of about greater than or equal to 0.961 to less than or equal to 0.968. The copolymers have a density of about greater than or equal to 0.89 to less than or equal to 0.96 and preferably greater than or equal to 0.917 to less than or equal to 0.955, and most preferably. of about greater than or equal to 0.917 to less than or equal to 0.935. The density of the copolymer, at a given melt index level for the copolymer, is primarily regulated by the amount of the C3 toC8 comonomer which is copolymerized with the ethylene. In the absence of the comonomer, the ethylene would homopolymerize with the catalyst of the present invention to provide homopolymers having a density of about greater than or equal to 0.96. Thus, the addition of progressively larger amounts of the comonomers to the copolymers results in a progressive lowering of the density of the copolymer. The amount of each of the various C3 to C8 comonomers needed to achieve the same result will vary from monomer to monomer, under the same reaction conditions. When made in the fluid bed process.polymers of the present invention are granular materials which have a settled bulk density of about 15 to 32 pounds per cubic foot and an average particle size of the order of about 0.005 to about 0.06 inches. For the purposes of making film in the process of the present invention. the preferred polymers are the copolymers and particularly those copolymers having a density of about greater than or equal to 0.917 to less than or equal to 0.924 and a standard melt index of greater than or equal to 0.1 to less than or equal to 5.0. The films made in the process of the present invention have a thickness of greater than 0.1 mil to less than or equal to 10 mils and preferably of greater than 0.1 mil to less than or equal to 5 mils. Having set forth the general nature of the invention. the following examples illustrate some specific embodiments of the invention. It is to be understood, however, that this invention is not limited to the examples, since the invention may be practiced by the use of various modifications.EXAMPLE 1 This Example demonstrates the conventional procedures for extruding ethylene polymers into tubes. An ethylene butene copolymer was prepared in accordance with the procedure of U.S. Patent 4.302.566. which is available from Union CarbideCorporation under the Trademark designation BakeliteGRSN 7047. The copolymer had a density of 0.918 gm cc, a melt index of 1.0 decigrams min., and a melt flow ratio of 26. The copolymer was formed into a tube by passing the resin through a conventional 2 1 2 inch diameter screw extruder having a polyethylene screw as described in U.S.Patent 4,329,313 with a Maddock mixing section and into a conventional die i.e., a 3 inch spiral mandrel die having a die gap of 45 mils, a land length to gap ratio of 10 1 an entry angle of 7.5 and a sharp lip configuration 90e . The sides of the die land were parallel with the flow axis of the polymer melt. The resin was extruded through the die at a rate of 70.8 lbs hr at a temperature of 226 C. The head pressure was 3700 psi. A conventional dual air lip ring was employed. The film had a frostline height of 20 inches, a blow up ratio of 2 and a film thickness of 1.3 1.5 mil.There was severe surface melt fracture observed on both surfaces of the tube with an average surface roughness of 23 microinch in the machine direction and of 52 microinch in the transverse direction, as measured with a Bendix Proficoder.EXAMPLE 2 This Example demonstrates the improved results over Example 1 by the use of contoured die lips both pin and collar . The ethylene butene copolymer and equipment were identical to Example 1 except for the changes indicated herein. The copolymer was formed into a tube by passing the resin through a conventional 2 1 2 inch diameter screw extruder and into the conventional die i.e., a 3 inch spiral mandrel die having a die gap of 45 mils, a land length to gap ratio of 10 1 and an entry angle of 7.5 . The die lips had a contoured lip configuration defining a 3 64 inch radius. The sides of the die land were parallel with the flow axis of the polymer melt.The resin was extruded through the die at a rate of 78.6 lbs hr at a temperature of 2250C. The head pressure was 3750 psi. The film had a frostline height of 27 inches, a flow up ratio of 2 and a film thickness of 1.3 1.5 mil. The surface melt fracture observed on both surfaces of the tube was considerably lower than in Example 1 with an average surface roughness of 12 microinch in the machine direction and of 27 microinch in the transverse direction.EXAMPLE 3 This Example demonstrates the improved results obtained by the use of a long land in combination with the contoured lips of the present invention. The ethylene butene copolymer and equipment were identical to Example 1 except for the indicated changes. The copolymer was formed into a tube by passing the resin through a conventional 2 1 2 inch diameter screw extruder and into the conventional die i.e, a 3 inch spiral mandrel die having a die gap of 45 mils, a land length to gap ratio of 45 1, an entry angle of 7.5 . The die lips had a contoured configuration defining a 3 64 inch radius. The sides of the die land were parallel with the flow axis of the polymer melt. The resin was extruded through the die at a rate of 87.2 lbs hr at a temperature of 2250C. The head pressure was 6300 psi. The film had a frostline height of 29 inches, a blow up ratio of 2 and a film thickness of 1.3 1.5 mil. Even at the higher extrusion rate, substantially smooth films were obtained with an average surface roughness of 3 microinch in the machine direction and of 7 microinch in the transverse direction. The measured surface roughness was about 85 90 lower than films produced in Example 1.
