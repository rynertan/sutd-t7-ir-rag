## Abstract
An electrophotographic light sensitive member com prises a conductive support 4 , a photoconductive layer 2 and a protective outer layer 1 , the protective outer layer com prising at least one partculate metal oxide having a mean parti cle size below 0.3 Âµm dispersed in an organic resin binder ma terial. The electrophotographic light sensitive member may be prepared by initially forming the protective oute layer and thereafter applying the photoconductive layer and conductive support thereto.
