# Apparatus for determing angular displacements of an object.

## Abstract
An apparatus is described for determining angular displacements of an object by means of a radial grating 2 connected to the object. Via an optical system comprising two ruled surfaces 7 and 8 said grating is imaged as a parallel grating onto a radiation sensitive detection system 14 com prising a line array of photo diodes 15 functioning as a grating like element.
