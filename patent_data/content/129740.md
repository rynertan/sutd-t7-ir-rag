## Description
SUPPORTING SUBSTRATE FOR HYDROPONICS AND AEROPONICS, AND METHOD FOR THE MANUFACTURE THEREOF The invention relates to a supporting substrate for hydroponics and aeroponics, as well as to a method of manufacturing said supporting substrate. It is a known fact that so called hydroponic and aeroponic cultures have gained widespread acceptance, said cultures being grown rather than in conventional soil, in an artificial medium, thanks to the advantageous conditions that they can afford from several standpoints, such as a high crop yield, early riping, removal of many cultivating procedures, etc. One of the more commonly applied forms of hydro and aeroponic cultures provides for a solid substrate accommodated in a specially arranged container wherethrough a nutritional solution is circulated which can nourish the roots of the plants grown in said substrate. Basic requirements for a good solid substrate are first of all a high porosity, meaning the presence through its mass of interstices for receiving the plant roots and allowing the nutritional solution therethrough, and good compactness to provide support for the plants other important features are the ability to not interact with the nutritional solution, thereby tbe substrate should be chemically inert, and have a high insulating power to limit thermal unbalance. materials more commonly used nowadays to form solid substrates are knoum to be such natural occurring materials as sand, gravel, pumice, or artificial materials as Vermiculite or Perlite, and all these materials have the dual disadvantage of being expensive and of not exhibiting all of the features listed above to an optimum degree. A highly economical material onto which the attention of the skilled ones has focused, in consideration of its having the two last mentioned features developed to the highest degree, it being chemically inert and having high insulating properties, is expanded polystryrene, which has never been adopted, however, because the forms of aggregation of the tiny balls comprising it which have been taken into consideration heretofore, that is completely loose balls and balls which are welded to one another in a compact form without interstices, are such as to completely lack one of the two first mentioned essential features for the substrate, namely compactness in the instance of loose balls, and porosity in the instance of welded balls without interstices. It is an object of this invention to provide a supporting substrate for hydroponics and aeroponics, wherein expanded polystyrene is used to provide a solid core. Another object of the invention is to provide a supporting substrate, wherein the container for the solid core can take highly simplified and inexpensive forms. A further object of this invention is to provide a method of manufacturing the supporting substrate, which can be implemented in a rapid and economical fashion. These objects are achieved by a supporting substrate for hydroponics and aeroponics, according to the invention, comprising a solid core 2 accommo dated inside a specially provided container 1 adapted to convey a nutritional solution, characterised in that said solid core 2 comprises sintered expanded polystyrene having a high void volume. A method of manufacturing the supporting substrate of this invention is characterised in that it comprises a first step of filling a tube with tiny balls of expanded polystyrene in a loose condition, a second step of sintering the tiny balls by the insertion of at least one probe adapted to conduct steam to the tube interior which during this step serves, accordingly, the function of a mould, and a third step of perforating the tube lateral surface. Further features and advantages will be more clearly understood from the following description of some preferred, but not exclusive, embodiments of the invention, with reference to the accompanying illustrative but not limitative drawings, where Figure 1 shows a section of this supporting substrate, according to a first embodiment thereof Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of a supporting substrate similar to that shown in Figure 1 but slightly modified with respect thereto Figure 3 shows a modified embodiment of this supporting substrate Figure 4 shows the top portion of the supporting substrate, as slightly modified with respect to the embodiment shown in Figure 3 and Figure 5 shows a further embodiment of the supporting substrate. With reference to Figure 1, the numeral 1 designates a channel, e.g. formed from sheet metal, which functions as a container for the solid core comprising expanded polystyrene in the form of a parallelepipedon 2, inserted through the channel in any desired manner and being sintered by conventional methods to a high void volume, i.e. with significant interspaces between welded polystryrene balls by way of example, we will mention values in the 209 to 25 range as being suitable to provide said void volume.Culture plants 3 are planted in an extremely rapid fashion by merely removing a few polystyrene balls from the sintered body to form a small recess where the plant stem can take an upright stance and be held in that position by the adequate compactness of the surrounding mass, and in time, the roots will gradually make their way through the interstices between balls which are swept by the nutritional solution fed into the channel in a conventional way, such as by percolation from the top or by subirrigation, and recovered also in a conventional way. The serrations 4 have the function of retaining the solid core 2 in position against the upwardly directed buoyant force applied by the nutritional solution. The sintered expanded polystyrene parallelepipedon 2 may include longitudinal cuts 5, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 illustrates a modified form of the supporting substrate which comprises a plastic tube 6 containing the solid core 7 formed by the sintered expanded polystyrene balls, and having in its lateral surface holes 8 adapted to allow the stems of the culture plants 9 to extend outwards, whose roots will extend, as discussed hereinabove, through the interstices between polystyrene balls to contact the nutritional solution being fed in a conventional manner. In order to direct the plant stems upwards, it is advantageously contemplated that the holes 8 be provided with a projecting lower lip 8a and recessed upper lip 8b, which may be readily formed by taking to the surface and then introducing a hot point. Of course, the tube 6 may be provided for a horizontal lay, and in that instance the holes in its lateral surface will have an even contour, and in the body of the sintered expanded polystyrene 7 a longitudinal middle cutout 10 may be provided, as shown in Figure 4, or alternatively, a plurality of such cutouts, also longitudinally and arranged as desired. A method which can lead to the manufacture of the supporting substrate shown in Figures 3 and 4 in a most rapid manner may be implemented in accordance with the teachings of published ItaISen Patent Application No. 84931 A 79 this method comprises a first step wherein a tube such as 6 is fELtd with loose balls of expanded polystyrene, with the optional presence of a plug to form cutouts such as 10, a second step of sintering said balls by inserting through holes such as 11 at least one probe adapted to convey steam to the tube interior which during this step acts, accordingly, as a mould, and a third step of forming holes such as 8 in the lateral surface. Shown in Figure 5 is a further embodiment of the supporting substrate particularly suitable for use with unproductive soils lacking irrigation water indicated at 12 therein is the soil wherein furrows 13 are formed which are then covered with a sheet 14 of a waterproof material, e.g. polythene, on which the solid core is laid which comprises the expanded polystyrene 15 and then secured therein by means of the soil edges 16. It should be noted that in this embodiment, wherein it is the soil which provides a container for the solid core, great savings are achieved in installation through the elimination of any supporting substrates which differently constructed containers require one way or the other. It may be appreciated from the foregoing description that the container for the solid core may take any of several forms in addition to the ones illustrated, we will mention an embodiment comprising a sheet of a waterproof material, such as aluminium, adapted to be placed, either rigid with or just laid on, around the periphery of the body forming the solid core, which may be optionally bordered with a mere coat of a waterproofing paint, the whole being then intended to rest on any structure or just over the ground0 The invention just described is susceptible to many modifications and changes without departing from the scope of the inventive idea further, all of the details may be replaced with other, technically equivalent, elements..In practicing the invention, the materials used and the shapes and dimensions may be any ones.
