# A semiconductor memory device having a memory matrix area and a plurality of peripheral circuits.

## Abstract
The device has a memory cell matrix area in which memo ry cells are provided at intersections of bit lines Bn, Bn , Bn 1, Bn 1 and word lines WD . Peripheral circuits, for ex ample, sense amplifiers SAn, SAn 1 , are provided in peri pheral circuit blocks SA and are connected to bit line pairs Bn, Bn Bn 1, Bn 1 . The width of the sense amplifiers SAn, SAn 1 corresponds to the distance between bit lines Bn and Bn 1 . Sense amplifiers SAn and SAn 1 connected to line pairs Bn, Bn and Bn 1, Bn 1 are arranged below an other in the direction of the bit lines. All the sense amplifiers are arranged in two ranks blocks SA, SA so that the need to fan out the bit lines to a sense amplifier block is avoided.
