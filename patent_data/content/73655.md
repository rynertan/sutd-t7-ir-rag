# Non metallic, bio compatible hemostatic clips with interlocking latch means.

## Abstract
Sterile, non metallic, bio compatible hemostatic clips of absorbable and non absorbable materials comprising two leg members joined with a resilient hinge. The distal ends of said leg members include latch means to lock the clip in a closed position. Each leg member has a vessel clamping inner face and the latch means in cludes means for preventing relative lateral movement between the vessel clamping inner faces when the clip is in a closed position.
