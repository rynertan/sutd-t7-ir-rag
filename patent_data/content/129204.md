# Braking apparatus.

## Abstract
There is provided a braking apparatus for vehicles having one or more sets of wheels mounted for rotation and a wheel of the or each set being located on each side of the vehicle. The braking apparatus is movable between operative and inoperative positions and comprises a braking mat assembly mounting means for securing the assembly to a structural member of the vehicle, the assembly including drum means having a shaft, braking mat means having a first wound por tion with a free end of the first portion being secured to the shaft when the apparatus is in the operative position and the mat means is located between the wheels and the surface upon which the wheels normally rest. Not all of the first por tion is unwound from the shaft. The braking mat means has an apron portion forming an extension to the first portion. The apparatus further comprises retaining means nor mally securing the free end of the apron portion away from the surface upon which the wheels travel, and normally main tains the mat means in the inoperative position. The apparatus has release means operative to enable the retain ing means to release the mat means so that it may be unwound from the shaft and moved to its operative position between the wheels and the surface. The apparatus has shock absorbing means to absorb at least some of the tension to which the mat means is subjected when in the operative position. When the mat means is in the operative position the wheels of the vehicle are prevented from rotating and the mat means frictionally engages the surface to brake the vehicle.
