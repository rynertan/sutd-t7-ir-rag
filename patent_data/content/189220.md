# Hydraulic twin pipe shock absorber.

## Abstract
The invention deals with the problem of upsetting the uniformity of action of a hydraulic twin pipe absorber for horizontal use by air and foam, that may collect in the horizon tal working cylinder 2 against the piston 3 as well as against the cover 5 of the working cylinder. A first connection is located in the piston against the clearances on either side of the piston. To get rid of air and foam collected against the piston a disc 28 is fixed against the piston said disc having a number of uniformly distributed protuberances 29 extending radially and with the surface of the piston bounding narrow radial chan nels which with their circumferential ends debouch in the working cylinder clearance and with their inside ends are con nected to channels 12 in the piston. A second connection ex tends through the cover. To get rid of air and foam collected against the cover an annular aeration channel 24 is positioned between the cover and the working cylinder clearance around the piston rod 4 , into which channel debouches a pipe 14 with a non return valve 13 , while disposed in the boundary wall of the annular aeration channel, facing the working cylinder clearance, are a number of regularly distributed bores 27 acting as a narrowing part.
