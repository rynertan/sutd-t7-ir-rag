# Soldering device and method.

## Abstract
A heat recoverable soldering device comprises a heat recoverable member 3 having a fusible solder insert 4 and associated with the solder insert 4 , a solder flux composi tion which undergoes a visible colour change at a critical temperature. Solderable substrates 12 are positioned with in the device and heated until a critical temperature has been reached as indicated by a colour change in the flux. The critical temperature depends on the material of the particular head recoverable member and the solder used. Flux com positions and their use in soldering are also disclosed.
