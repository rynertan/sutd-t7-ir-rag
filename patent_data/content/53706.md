# Method of manufacture multi wire nonimpact printheads.

## Abstract
A method of making a plurality of multi wire nonimpact printheads provides precise inter wire spacing accuracy and repeatability of manufacturing steps to enable mass produc tion. A plurality of slats 13 are molded, one alongside another on a cylindrical support shell 11 , parallel to the shell axis. A helical thread is engraved on the slats along the axial length of the support shell. A continuous wire 16 is wrapped in the thread and the portions of the wire on the slats are encapsulated. The support shell and wrapped wire is cut between adjacent slats to obtain a plurality of printhead blanks. Each blank is machined to smooth the exposed print wires. The resultant printheads may be used in page width nonimpact printers.
