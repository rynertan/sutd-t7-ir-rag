# An electronic length measuring device comprising a measuring tape which is rolled up in a gauging station.

## Abstract
The invention refers to an electronic length measuring device by which elongated articles as for example planks can be easily measured and the total cost of which can be easily calculated. The invention substantially comprises a measur ing tape 2 which can be pulled out from the gauging station, and at the free end of which an operating device 3 is arranged. The measuring tape 2 is provided with a number of detectable elements 11 arranged along the measuring tape 2 at equal distances from each other. The detectable elements 11 are detected by a detector 8 arranged in the gauging station, the signals of which are supplied to an elec tronic unit. The operating device 3 is furthermore provided with at least one switch 15 by means of which the operator is able to initiate the electronic unit to accumulate measured length values to a memory. This memory would be updated each time the switch 15 is manually activated and the value accumulated in the memory is shown on a sum display. The electric signals thus generated in the operating device 3 are transmitted by the transmission elements 12,13 which for example can consist of electric conductors to the gauging station and the electronic unit, said electric conductors being arranged in the measuring tape 2 .
