# NITROGENATION OF HYDROCARBONS TO PRODUCE CYCLIC IMIDES AND DINITRILES

## Abstract
A process for the nitrogenation of hydrocarbons, which results in the production of cyclic imides and nitriles comprises contacting hydrocarbons with molecular oxygen and a nitrogenating agent, including ammonia or primary amines, in the presence of an oxidation catalyst containing variable valency metal oxides, in the vapor phase at elevated temperature.
