## Description
BIPYRIDINE SUBSTITUTED IMIDAZOYLIDENECOPPER COMPLEX AND ITS USE IN FOOD PRODUCING ANIMALS, and BIPYRIDINE, 2,2 2 IMIDAZOLIDINYLIDENE DI COPPER COMPLEX AND USE IN ANIMALS . The present invention discloses bipyridine compounds, the Cu , Fe , and Ni salts of these compounds, mixing these salts with animal feed to produce an animal feed composition, and administering same to animals. The compounds are useful as animal feed efficiency enhancers. There is an ever increasing need for efficiency in producing animal protein for human consumption. As world population continues to increase, available animal feed materials increase in price, and it becomes most important that maximum growth potential from available feed materials be realized. In monogastric food producing animals such as swine and poultry, feed additives may be employed to protect against subclinical gastrointestinal infections, and thereby enable the target animal to realize its greatest foodproducing potential. When such animals receive such feed additives on a daily basis at low levels, greater control of parasitic infections, such as coccidiosis, can be realized, and more of the feed goes to growth. In ruminant animals such as cattle, goats and sheep, significant improvements in feed efficiency and growth can be obtained by chemical modification of the metabolism of rumen microorganisms. This may be accomplished by reducing the proportion of methane formed, and increasing the proportion of propionate at the expense of methane and acetate. Methane tends to be formed during fermentation of food in the ruminant. This represents a loss in feed energy intake, because the methane gas is lost by eructation. Propionic acid is a much more efficient precursor of glucose, from which the animal derives its energy and growth, than acetic acid. It is, therefore, most desirable to shift the balance of rumen metabolism toward propionate production to obtain more efficient feed utilization and to promote growth in ruminants. The subject invention is directed to certain novel bipyridine substituted imidazoylidene compounds, their copper complexes, and their use to improve feed efficiency and promote growth in food producing animals, particularly in ruminants.

EXAMPLE 1 The base composition was made as set forth below BenzilEMI7.1 Benzil is reacted with di 2 pyridyl ketone in the presence of ammonium acetate and glacial acetic acid to produce 2,21 4 ,5 diphenyl 2H imidazol 2 ylidene bispyridine, a tan solid having a melting point of 214 216sNC and a molecular weight of 374.4. The above benzil and di 2 pyridyl ketone compounds were obtained from Aldrich Chemicals, Inc.,Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The ammonium acetate and glacial acetic acid were obtained from Mallinkrodt Chemicals, Inc.,St. Louis, Missouri. The above compound was then reacted with anhydrous cuprous chloride CuC12 dissolved in hot, absolute alcohol as follows EMI7.2 CuCl2 hydrate was dried at 100 C in vacuo. The above reaction formed an immediate emerald green pre cipitate, but the mixture was allowed to stir for three days, after which the resulting solid was removed by filtration and washed with alcohol to yield 2,2 4,5 diphenyl2H imidazol 2 ylidene bispyridine complexed with CuC12 1 1 .This latter composition had a melting point of 299 3000C.Molecular weight was about 508.8. EXAMPLE 2 The above Formula IV composition was tested to determine its effectiveness as a feed additive for ruminants.The initial tests were in rumen fluid batch culture systems to determine the effect of the compound on volatile fatty acid methane ratios VFA CH4 . The subject compound was used at concentrations of 8.33, 25 and 75 ppm, and the effects compared to a positive control, monensin, at 12.5 ppm. A summary of the VFA, µs CH4 H2 production, and protein and amino acid accumulation are presented in Table 1. Test Procedure A 50 50 mixture of ground corn and ground alfalfa was used as the substrate for the subject rumen fluid batch culture test. The compound Formula IV was present in the rumen fluid in three separate test samples at 8.33, 25 and 75 ppm, respectively. On day 1, rumen fluid was obtained from mature fistulated steers on 50 50 concentrate roughage diets. The rumen fluid RF was strained through three layers of gauze cloth and equilibrated with CO2 gas. Wheaton serum vials 125 ml were prepared ahead with 20 ml continuous batch buffer and 100 mg 50 50 ground corn ground alfalfa. Con trols and compounds dissolved in acetone were set up according to desired levels. The vials were kept under CO2 gas until 20 ml of the strained RF was added. The vials were sealed and incubated at 390C for 24 hours in a hot water bath. On successive days, gas samples 0.1 ml were drawn for gas chromatography analysis before transferring 20 ml of the batch culture to another vial containing 20 ml of buffer, 100 mg substrate, and the corresponding compound.The remaining 20 ml was inoculated with 2 ml 6N HC1 and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 minutes. Ether extracts were prepared for volatile fatty acid VFA analysis.Some minor adjustments were made in the termperatures on the Hewlett Packard 5750 Gas Liquid Chromatograph used forVFA analysis when the glass column used was changed from 1 4 inch diameter to 1 8 inch diameter. Injection Port 2200C Column Oven 1700C Flame Detector 2500COnly 4 minutes was needed to record the sample instead of the previous 7 minutes.Results Table 1 lists a summary of the VFA and gas data which is given in per cent change from the controls. The Formula Iv compound increased propionate and decreased acetate at all levels tested, and this effect appeared to be dose related. At 8.33 pg ml, methane was decreased slightly. At 25 and 75 pg ml, there were slight decreases in methane during the first 6 days with no hydrogen production. On the seventh day, methane dropped drastically at these two levels, and there was some hydrogen pro duced. At 25 vg ml, methane production seemed to be recovering by day 10, but at 75 pg ml, methane was inhibited completely. Amino acid accumulation at 75 pg ml was similar to that observed with monensin.Table 2 shows the total volatile fatty acids VFA , methane and hydrogen produced at day 10, and Table 3 shows the caloric values of these various products. The Formula IV compound caused increased propionate and decreased acetate production, which resulted in more of the energy appeariny in propionate. Except for the 25 vg ml concentration, more butyrate was produced in the presence of the Formula IV compound than was produced by the control. Total energy in the end products appeared to be less than the control at 8,33 and 25 pg ml.

At the 75 ppm dosage level, the shift away from acetate production, and the increase in propionate production was most evident. Table 3 below further confirms tha6 the Formula IV compound is effective to shift the volatile fatty acid production from acetate to propionate. The 75 ppm dosage level of the Formula IV compound was the most effective amount for increasing the number of calories available from the animals feed.

EXAMPLE 3 The subject Formula IV compound was also compared to monensin in another rumen fluid batch culture test as set forth below. The test was designed to screen compounds for inhibition of starch breakdown by the rumen microflora.In this test, the rumen fluid batch culture containing 50 ppm of the Formula IV compound degraded only 28.7 starch relative to an unincubated control rumen fluid batch cul ture which did not contain the Formula IV compound. It is considered more desirable to avoid degradation of starch in the rumen so that it is passed on into the abomasum where it can be digested more efficiently. When the concentration of the Formula IV compound was increased to 75 ppm, the per cent starch degraded dropped to 13.9 relative to the unincubated control without the Formula III compound.Test Procedure Animals Mature fistulated steers were maintained on concentrate, roughage, or concentrate roughage 50 50 rations. Animals were fed twice daily at 8 00 A.M. and 4 00 P.M. Rumen Fluid Sampling and Preparation for BatchCulture Assays Approximately two liters of rumen fluid were collected from fistulated animals with the use of a hand pump. The rumen fluid, collected in a stoppered flask, was then immediately taken to the laboratory for processing.Samples were taken at 8 00 A.M. just prior to the first feeding or at 1 00 P M. ca. 4 5 hours after the first feeding . Rumen fluid was strained through six layers of cotton gauze cloth into a flask that was flushed with C02 gas. The filtrate was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 100 rpm in a Sorvall centrifuge to remove large particulate material.The supernatant was again passed through six layers of gauze into a flask under C02 gas and stoppered. Batch Culture Assay for the Degradation of Starch Twenty five ml of rumen fluid prepared as above was added to serum vials Wheaton Glass, 100 ml capacity containing 0.25 1.00 final concentration starch as an energy substrate in 25 ml batch culture assay buffer. The serum vials were sealed under C02 gas phase, and incubations were carried out for 20 24 hours at 390C on a New Brunswick rotary shaker 250 rpm . Each experimental vial was done in triplicate. The corn starch used in degradation experiments was previously washed with distilled water several times, filtered through an 8 micron 47 mm Millipore filter, and dried at 900C for 24 hours. At intervals of 0 and 24 hours, the entire contents in vials were centrifuged at 250 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatants were carefully removed with a pipet and the remaining starch pellets resuspended in water and passed through borosilicate glass microfiber prefilters MilliporeAP 20 047 00 . Filters were dried in an oven for 24 hours at 900C, cooled and then weighed. The amount of starch remaining after 24 hours incubation was compared with the amount present at 0 hours and the per cent of substrate degraded calculated.Results The rates of starch degradation observed in this study with rumen fluid were similar to those reported byPoe et al J. Animal Science 32 740 743, 1971 . Monensin and lasalocid were also compared to FÏr mula IV in this test procedure. At 25 ppm concentration, neither monensin or lasalocid had any effect on starch fermentation in the subject rumen fluid batch culture test of this Example 3 following the procedure outlined above. EXAMPLE 4Animal Test The object of this test is to determine the effect of the test compound on methane production in growing animals ruminants . A decrease in methane production is an indication of increased utilization of the animals feed supply, and possibly an indication of the effectiveness of the compound as a growth promoter. Test Procedure The test animals are housed in special respiration calorimetry facilities during the tests so that all metabolic gases can be collected and measured. Twelve wether lambs, weighing between 20 and 25 kg, were selected from a group of lambs purchased from theCalifornia Livestock Marketing Association. The animals were processed according to standard procedures after arrival, and they were ear tagged for identification purposes and weighed prior to being moved to the respiration calorimetry facility. Experimental Design The animals were fed 500 grams of a 30 concentrate diet Table 4 twice daily. Table 4 Composition of 30 Concentrate Diet Alfalfa 70 t Corn 20 Oats 8.5e Molasses 1 Trace Mineral Salt 0.5 Vitamin A and D supplement 660 IU Vitamin A kg and 330 IU Vitamin D kg The Formula IV compound was tested in three animals at a level of 75 ppm. The test period was one week. During the first 2 days of the week, animals received untreated feed.Treated feed was fed the next 3 days, and then untreated feed was fed for 2 days. Methane production was monitored during this time. Twelve animals were used, and six animals were placed in the respiration chambers at one time.The other six animals were held in metabolism cages, and fed control ration. Drug and Diet The Formula IV compound was fed at 75 ppm in the treated diet. Amichloral was used as a positive control, and was fed to all lambs. Feed was mixed as required. All formulations were analyzed at the end of the trial to determine compound stability. Animal Management Lambs were placed in metabolism cages and respiration chambers six in each for approximately 2 weeks before the start of the trial. Animals were switched after 1 week so that all animals have a chance to get used to being in the chambers. During this time, the animals were fed the diet to be used throughout d tF9k Animals were fed twice daily at 8 00 A.M. and 4 00 P.M. and received 500 grams of feed at each feeding. Sample Collection and Analysis Since only the gas data on methane was of interest, urine and feces were collected daily and discarded. Gas samples from each chamber were taken on the third day of treatment. These samples were analyzed by gas chromatography to get a qualitative measure of hydrogen production. The Formula IV compound showed a significant decrease in methane production compared to the negative control when tested in growing lambs according to the above test procedure Example 4 . TheFormula IV compound may, therefore, be considered useful as a feed additive for animals, particularly ruminants, to promote growth and enhance feed efficiency. EXAMPLE 5 The Formula III compound can be complexed with other related metal salts, in addition to copper. These metal salts of Formula III which include salts of iron and nickel are then evaluated in the rumen fluid batch culture tests set forth in Examples 2 and 3, and the results compared to those obtained with the copper complex Formula IV TheFormula IV copper complex is preferred, and test results show that it has activity comparable to monensin. EXAMPLE 6 The FormulaIII compound can be tested in a chick rye diet test system. When compared to the results obtained with a positive control, the Formula II compound 5shows promising activity. Useful antibiotics for the posi tive control comparison are penicillin or bacitracin. EXAMPLE 7 The base composition was made as set forth below EMI21.1 Ethylenediamine is reacted with 2,2 dipyridylketone dis 15solved in dry benzene to produce pyridine, 2,2 2 imiazol idinylidene di , a yellow solid having a melting point of 107 llloC, In te reaction procedure, about 55 parts of 2,2 dipyridylketone obtained from Aldrich Chemical Com pany, Milwaukee, Wisconsin was dissolved in about 250 parts of dry benzene. About 19 parts of ethylenediamine was added to the mixture, and it was refluxed for 16 hours, with a suitable means to remove water as it was formed.The benzene solvent was then evaporated, and the yellow solid residue was recrystallized from acetonitrile, and the product was dried under reducedpressure at 409C. The above compound was then reacted with anhydrous cupric chloride CuC12 dissolved in hot, absolute alcohol as follows EMI22.1 CuC12 hydrate was dried at l000C in vacuo About 1.3 parts of anhydrous cupric chloride was added to a stirred solution of about 2.3 parts of theFormula I compound dissolved in about 40 parts of absolute ethyl alcohol. The mixture was stored for about 24 hours, and was then filtered. The resulting light green solid was washed with water to produce the Formula II copper complex of Formula I having a melting point of 155 1580C, and a molecular weight of about 360.72. EXAMPLE 8 The above Formula II composition was tested to determine its effectiveness as a feed additive for ruminants. The initial tests were in rumen fluid batch culture systems to determine the effect of the compound on volatile fatty acid methane ratios VFA CH4 . The subject compound was used at a concentration of 75 ppm, and the effects compared to a positive control, monensin, at 12.5 ppm. A summary of the VFA, gas CH4 H2 production, and protein and amino acid accumulation are presented in Table 5. Test Procedure A 50 50 mixture of ground corn and ground alfalfa was used as the substrate for the subject rumen fluid batch culture test. The compound Formula II was present in the rumen fluid at 75 ppm. On day 1, rumen fluid was obtained from mature fistulated steers on 5015D concentrate roughage diets. The rumen fluid PF was strained through three layers of gauze cloth and equilibrated with C02 gas. Wheaton serum vials 125 ml were prepared ahead with 20 ml continuous batch buffer and 100 mg 50 50 ground cornlground alfalfa. Controls and compounds dissolved in acetone were set up according to indicated levels. The vials were kept underC02 gas until 20 ml of the strained RF was added. The vials were sealed and incubated at 390C for 24 hours in a hot water bath. On successive days, gas samples 0.1 ml were drawn for gas chromatography analysis before transferring 20 ml of the batch culture to another vial containing 20 ml of buffer, 100 mg substrate, and the corresponding compound. The remaining 20 ml was inoculated with 2 ml 6N HC1 and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 minutes. Ether extracts were prepared for volatile fatty acid VFA analysis.Some minor adjustments were made in the temperatures on theHewlett Packard 5750 Gas Liquid Chromatograph used for VFA analysis when the glass column used was changed from 1 2 inch diameter to 1y8 inch diameter, Injection Port 2200C Column Oven 1700C Flame Detector 2500CAbout 4 minutes was needed to record the sample. Results Table 5 lists a summary of the VFA and gas data which is given in per cent change from the controls.

For the positive control monensin and the test compound Formula II , the tests were run in duplicate, at the dosage levels indicated above, and the mean calculated from the results obtained.It can be seen that the Formula II compound depressed acetate production compared to the negative control, and was comparable to monensin in this regard. This is believed to be an indication that the subject compound is useful as a feed additive in ruminants to enhance feed efficiency, since less energy is wasted in the production of acetate, which, as pointed out above is transformed to methane gas and lost by the animal through eructation. It is expected that a favorable shift to increased propionate production will also become evident by tests to establish optimum dosage level. Table 6 below summarizes the batch rumen gas production, measuring methane and hydrogen production, and comparing a negative control, a positive control monensin and the subject Formula II compound.

These metal salts of Formula I which include salts of iron and nickel are then evaluated in the rumen fluid batch culture tests set forth in Example 7, and the results compared to those obtained with the copper complex Formula TI . Test results show that the copper complex gives the best activity.
