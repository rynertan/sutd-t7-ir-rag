# Roller device for roller conveyors.

## Abstract
A roller device for roller trains or roller conveyors has a unit consisting of one side face of a load carrying roller 1 and a supporting shaft 2a, 7 projecting from said side face and being non rotatably connected to the load carrying roller 1 and adapted to support a drive pulley 9 which is intended to be driven by a belt, chain or the like and can be passed on to the supporting shaft with any one of its ends facing said side face of the roller and which at one of said ends has coupling means 12 adapted, when the drive pulley is mounted on the supporting shaft with one end facing said side face of the roller, to engage coupling means 10 on the unit so as to provide a non rotatable engagement between the drive pulley and the load carrying roller, said drive pulley, at its other end, being so designed at 11 that when the drive pulley is mounted on the supporting shaft with the opposite end facing said side face of the roller, it comes clear of the coupling means 10 of the unit and is rotatable on the supporting shaft. The roller device further has retention means 8, 14 for the drive pulley to retain the drive pulley on said supporting shaft, said means comprising adjustable pressure means 14 mounted on said unit for displacement along the supporting shaft and adapted, at the end of the drive pulley which faces away from said side face of the roller, to urge the opposite end of the drive pulley into contact with said side face of the roller.
