## Description
In general, the present invention relates to video driver circuits and methods for use with a video display. More particularly, the invention relates to such circuits and methods having associated brightness and contrast controls of particular utility in the color video displays of television and data display units. In color video display systems such as television receivers and data display units it is necessary to have several signal paths with associated gain controls which must track together. With poor gain tracking between signal paths, an undesirable color error will occur. For example, the gain controls must track such that red, green and blue signals of equal amplitudes give white for all contrast control settings. Moreover, the contrast control of the color difference signals R Y and B Y must also track accurately. Previously, in bipolar integrated circuits, gain controls were usually independent current steering devices for each video signal path whose only advantage are their simplicity and small size. However, these individual current steering gain controls have major drawbacks in that V In the past, it has been generally necessary to provide separate drive controls for each of the three signal paths in a color video display. Further, inasmuch as the respective guns of a CRT picture tube age differently, it has been necessary to adjust the drive controls of the CRT throughout its life, particularly during the first twenty four hours. In this respect, it has been necessary to burn in the set to stabilize operation of the guns such that a final manual adjustment could be made of the respective gain controls. In this regard, several integrated circuits for television receivers have introduced automatic setting of the CRT operating point, or its dc black reference level. From US A 4 012 775 there is known a video display apparatus which compensates for variations in the characteristics of the display s CRT. Automatic adjustment occurs using two reference levels and feedback loops a black level producing a dc adjustment and a white level producing a gain adjustment. In US A 4,204,229 there is disclosed an arrangement which enables a contrast range to be defined for the video signal between two adjustable potential levels and thus an increase in contrast to be obtained when the signal intended for an image display varies within a more restricted range. However, since the brightness control of a television or video display receiver is usually accomplished by shifting the bias or dc reference level of the video display, this operation has the effect of changing both the average luminance of the display as well as the contrast ratio of the picture. In like manner, the contrast control is normally an amplitude control, the operation of which will also affect average luminance as well as the contrast ratio. In a colour television or data display system, saturation and hue may also be affected. Previously, there has been no provision for compensating the brightness control signal such that the picture black level remains unaffected by the contrast control signal. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved video driver circuit and method for automatic gray scale adjustment and elimination of contrast tracking errors which preferably provides for accurate tracking of gain between red, green and blue video signal paths in a video display and which may provide the accurate tracking of colour difference signals A Y and B Y in a video display. It is further desirable to obviate the burn in requirement of a CRT saving setup time and power, to allow for the elimination of separate drive controls for the separate video signal paths in a colour video display and to provide for the modulation of the brightness control signal by the contrast control signal such that picture black level does not change with contrast. The above mentioned and other objects and advantages of the present invention are provided by a video driver circuit as claimed in claim 1. The above mentioned and other features and objects of the invention and the manner of attaining them will become more apparent and the invention itself will be best understood by reference to the following description of an embodiment of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing, wherein The FIGURE is a simplified schematic representation of one of three video driver circuits for use in a conventional color video display according to the present invention. Referring now to the FIGURE, a simplified schematic representation of the invention 10 is shown. While the invention 10 is shown only in conjunction with a single cathode of 28 of a conventional cathode ray tube CRT 12, similar circuitry would be associated with each individual video signal path. Signals input to black reference input 42, brightness control input 44, contrast control input 46 and hence the output of brightness level modulation 36 would be common to each individual signal path. As shown, CRT 12 comprises a conventional video display having red, green and blue color guns. A video signal input 40 provides for the input of a respective video signal path to a given cathode 28 of CRT 12 by connection to switch terminal P of time multiplexed switch 14a. An individual video input signal applied to video signal input 40 is, during the time period represented by switch position P, coupled through variable gain amplifier 16 to output line 48. Output line 48 is coupled through video amplifier 18 to video output line 52. Diode 38, which has its anode and cathode respectively connected to the base and emitter of current sampling transistor 20, couples video output line 52 to cathode 28 of CRT 12. The collector lead of current sampling transistor 20 is connected to input line 54 of comparator 22, which is coupled to circuit ground by resistor 30. Reference voltage input line 56 of comparator 22 is connected to the common contact of time multiplexed switch 14c. Time multiplexed switch 14c has a dc setup voltage reference of 1.2 volts at terminal A thereof and a gain setup reference voltage of positive 12 volts at terminal B. Comparator output line 58 of comparator 22 is connected to the common contact of time multiplexed switch 14b. Terminal A of time multiplexed switch 14b is connected to buffer input line 60 of buffer amp 24. Black clamping capacitor 32 couples buffer input line 60 to circuit ground. Buffer input line 62 of buffer amp 26 is connected to terminal B of time multiplexed switch 14b. Gray clamping capacitor 34 couples buffer input line 62 to circuit ground. The output of buffer amp 24 is connected to output line 48 of variable gain amplifier 16. The output of buffer amp 26 appearing on feedback line 50 is applied to the variable gain terminal of variable gain amplifier 16. A dc signal is input to black reference input 42 connected to terminal A of time multiplexed switch 14a. A contrast control signal is input to contrast control input 46 for input to terminal B of time multiplexed switch 14a as well as one input of brightness level modulator 36. A brightness control signal is also applied as input to brightness level modulator 36 at brightness control input 44. The output of brightness level modulator 36 is also applied to switch terminal P of time multiplexed switch 14a. It should be noted that time multiplexed switch 14a, 14b and 14c are switched in sympathy by a control signal derived from the vertical and horizontal scan circuits of the television or data display unit. The control signal in the preferred embodiment is such that for a period of one horizontal scan period following vertical retrace, the time multiplexed switch 14a,14b and 14c are in position A . And for another horizontal scan period immediately following, in position B . In the preferred embodiment, these two time periods are arranged to be two consecutive horizontal scans immediately following vertical retrace. These picture lines are at the top of the picture and can be arranged to be off the active CRT 12 screen area. For the rest of the picture time, time multiplexed switch 14a, 14b and 14c are in position P . In the description of the invention, the letters A , B and P will also be used to denote the time periods of time multiplexed switch 14a, 14b and 14c. During period A the operation of the invention 10 is as follows A negative feedback loop is set up via video amplifier 18 and buffer amp 24, comparator 22 and current sampling transistor 20. The loop will cause the voltage developed across resistor 30 to adjust to a value substantially equal to the dc setup voltage reference of 1.2 volts applied to comparator 22 in this condition. The comparator 22 output voltage appearing on comparator output line 58, is applied to the input of buffer amp 24 on buffer input line 60 connected to terminal A of time multiplexed switch 14b. This output voltage will be such that buffer amp 24 furnishes the output signal which need be added to that from variable gain amplifier 16 to provide the necessary input signal to video amplifier 18. Since the CRT 12 cathode current corresponds to the nominal black level in this case, it follows that black will be reproduced whenever the ensuing picture signal matches the level applied at terminal A of time multiplexed switch 14a, assuming only that the gain of variable gain amplifier 16 has not changed in the meantime. In a three channel system, the ratio of resistors 30 will be chosen such that the system reproduces the desired black hue. The feedback loops will eliminate variations due to the CRT 12 gain, which may vary and age differently from gun to gun. In general, the blue gun is the most efficient and therefore a higher value resistance for resistor 30 would be utilized while the red gun is usually the least efficient and therefore a lower resistance would be utilized. During period B the operation is as follows A negative feedback loop is set up by video amplifier 18 and buffer amp 26, comparator 22, current sampling transistor 20 and variable gain amplifier 16. The loop will cause the voltage developed across resistor 30 to adjust to a value substantially equal to the gain setup reference voltage of 12 volts now applied to comparator 22 on reference voltage input line 56. The output voltage of comparator 22 on comparator output line 58 is applied to the gain control terminal of variable gain amplifier 16 through buffer amp 26. This will cause the gain of variable gain amplifier 16 to be adapted to the input signal applied thereto at terminal B of time multiplexed switch 14a, such that the total signal applied to video amplifier 18 corresponds to the necessary level. It follows that, other things being equal, the gain of variable gain amplifier 16 will be made inversely proportional to the input signal applied to it at terminal B of time multiplexed switch 14a. Thus, in a three channel system, it will suffice to apply the same variable level pulse to each of the variable gain amplifiers 16 to impose matching variations of gain. The ratio of the gains in the three channels will be automatically adapted to the ratio of the resistors 30 in each channel, since the three comparators 22 share the same positive 12 volt gain setup reference voltage. Since the black level currents are automatically adapted to the ratio of the three resistors 30 also, it follows that correct hue will be maintained at all signal levels and at all gain or contrast control settings. During period P the operation is as follows Brightness control is effected by adding a continuous signal from brightness level modulator 36 to the video input signal applied to video signal input 40. Thus, if a continuous positive signal were added to the video signal level which would have corresponded to nominal black, it would become brighter, whereas, if a continuous negative signal were added, it would become less bright. This continuous signal, or pedestal, must be added to all three channels prior to the input of variable gain amplifier 16, and its amplitude must be modulated in the same manner as the amplitude of the gain control insert or contrast control signal applied to contrast control input 46. If not, the brightness would change with contrast. For example, if the contrast is reduced by 6 dB then the brightness control pedestal added during period P must likewise be increased by 6 dB. This requirement is satisfied in the preferred embodiment by varying the level of the brightness control pedestal at the output of brightness level modulator 36 in accordance with the applied contrast control signal applied to contrast control input 46. The circuit is designed such that the output of brightness level modulator 36 varies in inverse proporation to the gains of the variable gain amplifiers 16. In the preferred embodiment, video amplifier 18 is a high voltage amplifier suitable for the drive of cathode 28 of CRT 12, which it does via diode 38 and current sampling transistor 20 in its emitter follower configuration. It is obvious that the electron beam current of CRT 12 appears as the collector current of current sampling transistor 20 which develops a positive voltage with respect to circuit ground across resistor 30. In the preferred embodiment, the voltage across resistor 30 is restricted to about 18 volts which serves to prevent current sampling transistor 20 from saturating. Comparator 22 compares the voltage developed across resistor 30 with either the dc setup voltage reference of positive 1.2 volts or the gain setup reference voltage of positive 12 volts as selected by time multiplexed switch 14c. The comparator output voltage on comparator output line 58 is transferred to either black clamping capacitor 32 or gray clamping capacitor 34 by time multiplexed switch 14b. It is appropriate to mention that digital techniques of storing the samples, such as an analog to digital and digital to analog method. could be used instead of the black and gray clamping capacitors 32 and 34. Also, resistor 30 could be replaced by a capacitor, the peak voltage reached during the sample period being the integrated current of the CRT 12 over the sample period. It is also apparent that it is possible to sample at rates other than the vertical scan rate of the television or data display unit. That is, it is reasonable to sample the dc condition after one vertical retrace and then sample the gain one picture frame later. That is, to sample at one half the vertical scan rate. It is also apparent that comparator 22 may be split into two separate comparators individually enabled by commands during time periods A and B . The means of limiting the voltage on resistor 30 to prevent current sampling transistor 20 from saturating may also be used as a peak beam limiter. By feeding the limiter current back to the contrast control it is possible to obtain a contrast pulldown signal at a predetermined beam limit. This limit will be determined by the limiter voltage and a resistor with series diode to the 12 volts supply such that the resistor does not effect the sampling process but offers a lower value when the voltage on resistor 30 exceeds the 12 volt supply. It is also desired that variable gain amplifier 16 be dc balanced such that changes in the gain control loop do not require changes in the dc loop. What has been provided then is an improved video driver circuit and method for automatic gray scale adjustment and elimination of contrast tracking errors which provides for the accurate tracking of gain between red, green and blue video signal paths in a video display as well as the accurate tracking of R Y and B Y color difference signals. The apparatus and method of the invention 10 also obviates the burn in requirement of a CRT 12 saving setup time and power. Further, the invention 10 allows for the elimination of separate drive controls for the separate video signal paths in a color video display. Finally, the invention 10 provides for the modulation of the brightness control signal by the contrast control signal such that picture black level does not change with contrast.
