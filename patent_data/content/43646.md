# Separation of chromium from scrap.

## Abstract
To recover chromium and, optionally other metals, from scrap of complex alloys such as superalloys, the scrap is sulphided to provide a molten matte which is cooled and fragmented. The fragments are slurried in an aqueous solution maintained at an elevated tempe rature and are agitated whilst being leached with chlo rine which is introduced into the solution at such a rate that its redox potential remains below 600 mV. The major portion of the chromium remains in the leach residue whilst other metals present go into solution as chlorides.
