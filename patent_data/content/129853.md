# Cellular type robot apparatus.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a cellular type robot apparatus consisting of a plurality of cellular robots 11 34 each having intelligence wherein each cellular robot controls the opera tion of its own on the basis of information exchange with adjacent cellular robots, the operations of the cellular robots are as a whole coordinated, and each cellular robot can be controlled without the necessity of change of hard and soft wares even when a part of cellular robots is out of order or is expanded. Each cellular robot can be increased or decreased in a building block arrangement. More definitely, each cellular robot has arms corresponding to hands and feet, can control the operation by itself. As the cellular robots are connected and combined through transmission routes so as to exchange information, they can operate cooperatively as a group of cellular robots. The operation of the group of cellular robots is to constitute the shape of a predetermined pattern besides the operations of entwining an object, and gripping and moving the object.
