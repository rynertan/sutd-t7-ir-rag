# Process and device for collecting rainwater.

## Abstract
From a rainwater pipe, rainwater is supplied to a storage vessel near the bottom of the vessel, which further is provided with an overflow and a drain point. The device possesses a throughgoing vertical downpipe section 1 from which the water is introduced into the vessel via a branch pipe 6 and in which the water in excess of the vessel s capacity is discharged via the overflow. The vessel and its parts are made in one piece by blow moulding from plastic. The device is substantially intended for collecting small amounts of water.
