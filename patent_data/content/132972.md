## Description
A CHARGE ELECTRODE STRUCTURE FOR INK JET PRINTERS, AND A METHOD OF FABRICATING THE SAME The present invention relates generally to ink Det printing systems and, more particularly, to a molaed charye electrode structure or charye plate and method of fabricating the charge plate for use in an ink 3et printing system. In ink jet printers, tiny ink drops are selectively deposited onto a medium, typically a moving web or sheet to form a printed image. The ink drops are formed from liquid filaments emerging from tiny openings in an orifice plate communicating with an ink reservoir containing pressurized electrically conductive ink. By mechanically stimulating the orifice plate, uniformly sized and spaced drops are forced to break off from the fluid filaments. As each drop separates from its associated fluid filament, it is permitted to remain uncharged or is selectively charged to one or more charge levels by an associated charge electrode. The drops then pass through an electrical deflection field. Printing is performed in a variety of ways. For example, charged drops can be deflected by the deflection field to a drop catcher and uncharged drops which are not deflected by the field continue past the catcher to form the printed images, for example, on a moving web of material. Alternatively, the uncharged drops may be caught with the charged drops being deflected to one or a variety of positions on the moving web dependent upon the charge level of the particular drop. In any event, the importance of the charge electrode structure to proper operation of an ink jet printer is cledrly evident. Typical prior art charge electrodes have been formed by coating electrically conductive material onto a nonconductive substrate. Many prior art charge electrodes have partially or wholly surrounded the corresponaing ink jet stream and normally extend uniformly along the stream for a distance of at least several drop diameters. Due to the tendency of the ink drops to separate from the filaments at different points, the electric field produced by a charge electrode must be uniform along the length of the ink filaments so that drops are properly charged regardless of their exact point of separation. Early patents to Loughren, U.S. Patent No.3,404,221 and Sweet et al., U.S. Patent No.3,373,437, utilized cylindrically shaped tubular electrodes to completely surround the ink jet stream or U shaped channel electrodes to partially surround the stream. Unfortunately, accurate placement of the tubes or channels into a support structure and electrical connection of such electrodes to a signal source are both difficult and time consuming. Such placement and connection problems increase as the spacing between electrodes is reduced ie multiple jet systems utilizing hundreds of individual streams of ink drops spaced within a few thousandths of an inch of one another. Also, as the spacing between adjacent electrodes is reduced, the tube or channel walls become extremely thin. Thin electrode walls reduce reliability and, at some point, preclude formation of such electrodes. Various attempts have been made to reduce the difficulty and expense of forming charge electrodes. For example, Beam et al., U.S. Patent No.3,586,907, shows a charge ring plate wherein a series of holes have an electrically conductive coating surroundiny each hole and extending along the walls to form the charge electrodes. Electrical lead lines are plated onto the surface of the charge plate and extend from each charge ring to a connection point. The techniques involved in plating the walls of the holes to obtain a continuous and uniform coating are complex and involve plating in several dimensions. Similarly, coating the U shaped channel shown in Culp, U.S. Patent No. 3,618,858, with an electrically conductive material also involves plating in several dimensions. Robertson, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,604,980 and 3,656,171, disclose charge electrodes formed by a series of strips of electrically conductive material plated onto a dielectric planar surface with each strip connected to a charging signal source. Kenworthy, U.S. Patent No. 4,223,321, discloses a planar charge plate wherein grooves are cut into the edge of a nonconductive substrate with the grooves and lands being metalized and printed circuit paths formed leading from the grooves. The grooves are then filled with an electrically conductive material, such as solder, and the front face of the structure is lapped to remove excess solder and metal plating from the lands to form the charge plate. The charge electrodes of Robertson andKenworthy differ from other prior art charge electrodes in that they do not surround or partially surround the drop streams. However, the formation of Robertson s conductive strips still requires plating in several dimensions and Kenworthy requires accurate machining initially to form the grooves in the substrate. Bahl and Schutrum, U.S. Patent No.4,347,522, discloses a method of forming charge electrodes by laminating a plurality of thin sheets of electrically conductive material to construct essentially any form of electrode. Another example of forming charge electrodes is disclosed by Bahl et al. in U.S. Patent application Serial No. 348,476 filed on February 12, 1982.In this application, wires are wrapped around a nonconductive charge plate support structure, preferably having wire locating notches formed into opposite end faces. The wire is then adhered to the structure and the wire along one end face is exposed to form individual charge electrodes. While charge electrodes manufactured in accordance with the teachings of a variety of the prior art provide satisfactory operation of ink jet printers and have typically provided somewhat reduced costs as the art has advanced, more simplified methods for producing reliable charge electrode structures at still further reduced costs are always needed and desirable for advances and improvements in the ink jet art. The invention provides a novel molded charge electrode structure or charge plate and a method of fabricating such a charge plate for use in an ink jet printer. According to one aspect of the present invention, the charge plate comprises a dielectric substrate having a plurality of regularly spaced electrodes embedded into a first surface or charge face of the substrate and a plurality of electrically conducting circuit paths terminating in connection points embedded into a second surface of the substrate with the circuit paths being electrically connected to the electrodes for convenient connection of the electrodes to source of charging potential. The electrodes and circuit paths preferably include retaining means extending beyond their generally parallel sidewalls at the innermost extensions of the electrodes and circuit paths to anchor the electrodes and circuit paths into the dielectric substrate. The retaining means comprise expansions of the electrodes and circuit paths to form retaining flanges which, when viewed from the end, resemble the caps of mushrooms or the heads of nails. The retaining flanges securely engage the dielectric substrate to prevent withdrawal of the embedded electrodes and conducting paths from the substrate. Preferably, the dielectric substrate comprises an epoxy resin or other dielectric material which may De readily molded to completely surround the electrodes and circuit paths including the generally parallel sidewalls as well as the retaining flanges of the electrodes and circuit paths. To reduce the volume of epoxy resin required to form a given substrate, sheet means, for example, a perforated sheet of fiberglass epoxy board may be placed over the electrodes prior to molding the substrate.A reduction of the volume of epoxy resin required reduces shrinkage of the epoxy resin during curing.Further, the sheet of fiberglass epoxy board can be covered with a conductive material or replaced by a perforated sheet of stainless steel either of which are connected to a selected potential to reduce signal interference or cross talk between the electrodes and circuit paths. The charge plate structure of the present invention provides a rugged, high reliability charge plate having high dimensional accuracy and excellent electrical characteristics which is relatively inexpensive and readily fabricated in accordance with the method of the present invention by means of highly accurate photolithograpbic, plating and molding techniques without any requirement for high precision machining operations. In a method of fabricating a charge plate in accordance with the present invention, a pattern defining electrode and associated connecting circuit path positions is formed onto a substantially planar foil sheet with the remainder of the sheet being protected by a covering which is resistant to plating operations. Preferably, the foil sheet is copper and the pattern is formed by initially laminating a photoresistive film covering to the toil sheet, exposing the photoresistive covering to actinic light through a photomask to define the electrode and circuit path pattern and removing the portion of the covering corresponding to the pattern to expose the surface of the copper foil thereunder. The exposed pattern is then plated with an electrically conducting material, preferably nickel, to form electrodes and the associated connecting circuit paths. The electrodes and associated circuit paths are preferably formed to a thickness which exceeds the thickness of the photoresistive covering.By plating to a thickness beyond that of the photoresistive covering, the plated material extends above and expands over the upper surface of the covering to form retaining flanges on each of the electrodes and circuit paths. The plating operation is limited such that no two of the flanges interconnect with one another. The remainder of the photoresistive covering is then thoroughly removed from the foil sheet such that the electrodes and the connecting circuit paths with their retaining flanges extend above the surface of the foil sheet. The foil sheet is then bent toward the plated material with at least a portion of the electrodes being bent and angularly oriented, preferably at approximately a 90 angle, relative to the circuit paths. The bent portion of the foil sheet including at least a portion of the electrodes will define the charge face of the finally formed charge plate. A dielectric substrate is then formed to surround the plated material including the retaining flanges. The substrate is formed to have two surfaces covered by said foil sheet which is then removed to expose the plated material electrodes and circuit paths embedded within the substrate and preferably anchored thereto by means of retaining flanges. Preferably, the bent foil sheet is clamped into a mold with the portion of the sheet including the connecting circuit paths being clamped to the mold as well as the bent portion of the sheet to ensure flatness of those portions of the substrate after formation. The dielectric substrate is then formed by inserting molding material, such as an epoxy resin, into the mold and curing the molding material to form the dielectric substrate. A perforated sheet of fiberglass epoxy board can be inserted into the mold to displace some of the epoxy resin and thereby reduce shrinkage of the epoxy resins during curing. The fiberglass sheet may be covered with an electrically conductive coating which is connected to a selected potential, typically ground, to reduce potential interference or cross talk between signals on the electrodes and circuit paths. Alternately, the fiberglass sheet can be replaced by a perforated sheet of stainless steel which is connected to a selected potential to both reduce required epoxy volume and reduce interference. Either fiberglass epoxy sheets or stainless steel sheets also serve to strengthen the substrate and, hence, the charge plate of the present invention. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a molded charge plate wherein the electrodes and connecting circuit paths are embedded within a dielectric substrate with the electrodes and circuit paths being anchored into the substrate by means of retaining flanges formed at their innermost ends with the moldea charge plate being advantageously fabricated by means of highly accurate and easily performed photographic, plating and molding operations. Other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description, the accompanying drawings and the appended claims. In order that the invention may be more readily understood, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a patterned foil sheet ready to be plated. Fig. 2 is a cross section through the electrode portion of the pattern shown on Fig. 1 along the section line 2 2.

Fig. 4 is a cross sectional view through the plated electrodes and foil sheet of Fig. 3 along the section line 4 4. Fig. 5 shows the composite foil sheet plating of Fig. 3 having the electrode end bent toward the plated material. Fig. 6 is a perspective view of an illustrative mold including the bent composite of Fig. 5 together with a clamp arrangement for clamping the bent portion of the composite to a sidewall of the mold see drawing sheet 4 . Fig. 7 is a plan view of the mold of Fig. 6 with the clamp arrangement secured to the mold. Fig. 8 is a cross sectional view through the mold of Fig. 6 along the section line 8 8. Fig. 9 is a fragmentary sectional view of a small portion of a foil sheet and three electrodes or circuit paths embedded within a dielectric substrate. Fig. 10 is the same as Fig. 9, except the foil sheet has been removed to expose the electroaes or circuit paths and intervening surface areas of the dielectric substrate. Fig. 11 is a perspective view of a molded charge electrode structure having embedded and anchored electrodes and connecting circuit paths in accordance with the present invention see drawing sheet 3 . The present invention will now be described by initially describing the method of fabrication of the molded charye electrode structure. After the method of fabrication is fully understood, the novel structure of the molded charge plate will be more clear. Fig. 1 shows a foil sheet 100 with a photoresistive covering 102 on its upper surface. One fabrication of an operable charge plate in accordance with the present invention, utilized electrodeposited ED copper foil having a thickness of 1.4 mils 0.0014 inches which was laminated with one layer of photopolymer film resist commercially available from DuPont as Type 21 so, to form a photoresistive covering 1.8 mils 0.0018 inches thick. The photoresistive material was then selectively exposed through a photomask to actinic light ultraviolet light of a wavelength of 300 to 400 nanometers for the identified photoresistive material . For the identified photoresistive material, the photomask is in the positive mode which prevents light from striking the electrode and conducting path pattern 104 shown in Fig. 1. Photoresistive material exposed to the actinic light is polymerized.After exposure, an aqueous alkaline solution is utilized to develop or wash away the nonpolymerized areas of the covering corresponding to the electrode and connecting circuit path pattern 1U4. The pattern 104 thus prepared defines the locations or positions for the formation of electrodes and connecting circuit paths on the foil sheet 100. It should be noted that a variety of foils and foil thicknesses may be combined with various thicknesses of a variety of photoresistive materials and processed in accordance with well known techniques to form a patterned foil sheet as shown inFig. 1. In particular, the depth of the photoresistive covering determines the embedded depth of the electrodes and circuit paths as will become clear.While such well known materials and techniques will not be further described herein it should be noted that any combination of these known techniques and materials may be utilized in the present invention. Fig. 2 shows a sectional view taken through the electrode portion 104A of the pattern 104 showing that the photoresistive material 102 corresponding to the pattern 104 has been removed down to the copper foil 100. The remaining areas of the polymerized photoresistive covering 102, as shown inFig. 2, serve as a resistant barrier to plating operations which are utilized to form the electrodes and connecting circuit paths of the molded charge electrode structure on the foil sheet 100. The patterned laminated foil sheet of Fig.1 is preferably placed into a plating bath although any appropriate plating technique can be employed in accordance with the present invention. In the plating bath, an electrically conducting material, preferably nickel, is plated to the foil sheet 100 through the openings in the photoresistive material 102 which define the pattern 104. The plating operation is controlled such that the thickness of the plating exceeds the thickness of the photoresistive material 102 by approximately 0.2 mils 0.0002 inches . For example, the current density and plating time is controlled for electrolytic plating. As the plating material extends above the parallel sidewalls 105 of the photoresistive material 102 defining the pattern 104 see Fig. 2A , the plating material overplates the photoresistive material to spread beyond the limitations defined by the sidewalls 105 and thereby form retaining flanges 106. The retaining flanges 106 appear in cross section as the heads of nails or the tops of mushrooms.The plating operation is limited such that the retaining flanges 106 formed on the upward ends of the plated material electrodes and connecting circuit paths extend beyond the sidewalls 105 but not to such an extent that they contact adjacent retaining flanges. The remaining polymerized photoresistive material is next removed by a mixture of dimethyl chloride and 3 methyl alcohol. The cleaning procedure must be thoroughly performed to ensure removal of the photoresist from beneath the edges of the retaining flanges 106 such that the electrodes and connecting circuit paths cleanly extend above the foil sheet 100 as shown in Fig. 4. Cleaning results in a composite foil sheet plating 108 comprising the foil sheet 100 with plated electrodes and connecting circuit paths 106 electroformed in the positions defined by the pattern 104 and extending above the surface of the foil sheet 100 as shown in Fig. 3.One or more alignment pins 107 can also be formed by means of the plating operation to facilitate alignment of the molded charge plate of the present invention with an associated ink jet printing head. The composite foil sheet plating 108 shown in Fig. 3 is then bent in a conventional manner toward the plated material electrodes and circuit paths to form an upwardly extending portion 108A and a horizontal portion 108B. For example, a bending die engages the plated side of the composite and bends the composite by forcing it into a resilient backing pad which engages the unplated side of the composite. The bend is formed such that at least a portion of the electrodes 106A are oriented at approximately 900, 890 being preferred, relative to the remainder of the foil sheet containing the conducting circuit paths 106B. The bent composite 108 as shown in Fig. 5 is then placed into a mold, an illustrative embodiment of which is shown in Fig.6. Substantially evenly spaced dummy electrodes may be formed across the entire width of the foil sheet 100 as suggested by the dotted line electrodes 109 as shown in Fig. 3. Such dummy electrodes appear much the same as the alignment pins 107 but are spaced approximately the same as the electrodes 106A and extena from the outermost ones of the electrodes 106A substantially to the edges of the foil sheet 100. The formation of dummy electrodes provides a substantially uniform thickness for the composite foil sheet plating 108 in the area to be bent and, hence, tends to enhance the yield of charge plates formed in accordance with the present invention. Sheet means, for example, a perforated sheet of fiberglass epoxy board 111, can be inserted into the mold over the conducting circuit paths 106B and connecting points 106C as shown in phantom inFig. 5. The board 111 displaces some of the epoxy to thereby reduce shrinkage of the epoxy during curing. The board 111 can be covered with an electrically conductive coating which in turn is connected to a selected potential, typically ground potential, via an otherwise isolated connecting point lily. The grounded conducting covering reduces potential interference or cross talk between the signals on the electrodes and connecting circuit paths. Alternately, a perforated sheet of stainless steel, insulated from the circuit pat hs 106B and connecting points 106C can be used for epoxy displacement. The stainless steel sheet can also be utilized to reduce interference or cross talk by being connected to ground in a manner similar to that of the conductive coating on the fiberglass board as described above. Of course, a fiberglass, stainless steel or other appropriate epoxy displacement sheet also serves to strengthen the substrate and, hence, the charge plate of the present invention. The mold as shown in Fig. 6 comprises a base plate 110 to which two mold forming, generallyL shaped members 112 and 114 are adjuXitably secured by bolts 116 to form a variety of mold sizes. While any suitable mold can be utilized in accordance with the present invention, the mold shewn in Fig. 6 provides for clamping the horizontal portion 10so3 of the foil sheet 100 including the connecting paths 106B to the base plate 110 of the mold by initially moving the mold forming members 112 and 114 to their extreme extended positions and insert ing the edges of the composite foil sheet plating 1CJ8 under short extensions 112A and 114A of the L shaped members 112 and 114, Slots 118 are formed in the short extensions 112A and 114A to accommodate the bent upwardly extending portion 108A of the foil sheet platiny composite 108. The slots 118 are not required if the upwardly extending portion 108A is initially clamped to the mold.Such initial clamping may be perforated by alternate mold and or clamp embodiments as wold be apparent to one skilled in the art. An upward extension 120 on the L shaped member 112 provides for clamping the bent upwardly extending portion 108A of the composite 108 to ensure flatness of the substrate face into which the electrode L06A will be embedded. A generally flat bar 122 is positioned upon the upper surface of the short extensions 112A and 114A of the L shaped members 112 and 114 and is clamped to secure the bent upwardly extending portion 108A of the composite 108 against the upward extension 120 of the member 112.An illustrative clamp 124 is shown in Figs. 6, 7 and Z alp though any form of clamp can be provided to ma1atain camping pressure on the bar 122 or to substitute for the clamp 124 and the clamping bar 122. The clamp 124 comprises first and second clamp member 126 and 128 which are secured to one another for clamping by bolts 130. The first clamp member 1R6 has a notch 132 .for engaging the extension 120 and the second clamp member 128 has a notch 134 for enQiinSI the bar 122. The second clamp member 128 also has a second notch 136 into which the bent upwardly extending portion 108A of the composite 108 can extend during the substrate molding operation. A limited clamping pressure is desirable to prevent deformation of the clamped plating. It is noted, however, that the plating may be limited such that it does not extend to the portion of the foil sheet which is clamped. Further, any deformation may be trimmed away together with excess portions of the foil sheet after substrate molding. Once the bent composite 108 is positioned and clamped within the mold, a casting resin is injected into the mold to form a dielectric substrate 138 see Fig. 11 for the molded charge electrode structure. The casting resin should have a relatively low viscosity, exhibit little shrinkage upon curing, be relatively strong and physically stable. One casting resin which has been found suitable is an epoxy resin comprising Bisphenol A and Epichlorohydrin which is sold by Emerson BR Cuming, Inc. of Northbrook, Illinois, under the nameSTYCAST 2850FT. This resin is mixed by weight in a ratio of about 100 parts STYCAST 2850FT resin with 4 to 5 parts of a modified aliphatic amine catalyst such as identified by Emerson Cuming, Inc. asCATALYST 11. Standard molding practices, release agents and air evacuation using vacuum are recommended for the molding process all of which are well known in the art and will not be described in detail herein. The filled mold is then cured at 1000 C oven for approximately 2 hours. After curing, the mold is taken apart, excess foil is trimmed away and the entire molded piece is immersed in a conventional etchant to remove the foil but not adversely effect the plating material or the substrate. Fragmentary sectional views of a small portion of the foil sheet 100 and three electroaes or circuit paths with three associated retaining flanges 106 embedded into the dielectric substrate 138 are shown before and after removal in Figs. 9 and 10, respectively. The molded piece is then finished on the poured surface by conventional methods or alternatively, the mold may include an upper surface such that no further finishing is required. For example, the clamping bar 122 could be widened to extend over substantially the entire length of the mold cavity.It is to be understood that any molding process which will result in a dielectric substrate in which the electrodes and circuit paths and their retaining flanges are embedded may be utilized in accordance with the present invention. It will be appreciated from an understanding of the above described fabrication method of the present invention that the novel molded charge electrode structure formed by that method, as shown in Fig. 11, comprises a rugged, high reliability charge plate having high dimensional accuracy and excellent electrical characteristics which is inexpensively and readily fabricated by means of highly accurate photolithographic, plating and molding techniques without any requirement for high precision machining operations. The electrodes 106A and the connecting circuit paths 106B which terminate in connecting points 106C are three dimensional electroformed structures which are embedded into the dielectric substrate 138 and anchored into that substrate by means of internally engaged retaining flanges 106 best seen in Figs. 9 and 10. Further, the operations performed in accordance with the method of the present invention readily lend themselves to automated fabrication of the novel molded charge plates. While the method herein described and the form of apparatus constructed in accordance with the method constitute preferred embodiments of this invention, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to this precise method and form of apparatus and that changes may be made in either without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
