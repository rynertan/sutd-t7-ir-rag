# Preparation of metal containing catalysts.

## Abstract
A method of preparing supported unimetallic catalysts of improved activity having uniform metals distribution involves saturating the catalyst support with carbon dioxide prior to impregnation with the desired metal. Unimetallic catalysts embraced by the invention comprise a metal selected from ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, manganese, technetium and rhenium.
