# Apparatus and method for optical guidance system for automatic guided vehicle.

## Abstract
In a guided vehicle system which includes a vehicle freely maneuverable along a variable, predetermined path by naviga tion means operatively associated with and controlling said ve hicle by computing the position of said vehicle relative to at least one fixed point having a known position relative to the path, said navigation means comprising a light receiving lens mounted on one of said vehicle or said fixed point a light source mounted on the other of said vehicle or said fixed point for sending light energy through the lens computing means operatively associated with said lens for calculating the posi tion of the vehicle relative to said fixed point and generating a vehicle control output signal responsive thereto and vehicle maneuvering apparatus for receiving and responding to the ve hicle control output signal.
