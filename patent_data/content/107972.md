## Description
A METHOD FOR OPTICAL RESOLUTION OF a ISOPROPYL p CHLOROPHENYLACETIC ACID The present invention relates to a method for optical resolution of a isopropyl p chlorophenylacetic acid hereinafter referred to asICPA . More particularly, it relates to a method for the optical resolution of ICPA by using an optically active a phenyl ss p tolyl ethylamine hereinafter referred to as PTE as an optical resolving agent. ICPA, an object of the present invention, is the carboxylic acid moiety of, for example, pyrethroid type insecticidal esters such as fenvalerate. The followings are well known on saidICPA Its isomer has little insecticidal activity as the ester, while the ester of its isomer has an insecticidal activity of about two times that of the isomer Japanese Patent ApplicationKokai Laid open No. 136245 1980 . There is a strong demand, therefore, for the development of a method to obtain said isomer of ICPA more advantageously in industry. It is hitherto. known that an optically active PTE or a phenethylamine is used as an optical resolving agent for ICPA Japanese Patent ApplicationKokai Laid open No. 25544 1975 . In order to obtain pure ICPA of high optical purity, however, it is necessary to use large quantities of solvent and to repeat recrystallization several times and when PTE of low optical purity is used, the filterability of the salt crystal becomes extremely poor, thereby making it difficult to obtain ICPA of high optical purity. It may therefore be said that, in order to obtain ICPA of high optical purity, this method is still not always satisfactory in that it is obliged to use PTE of high optical purity.Also, as an improved method to solve the foregoing problems, it is known that, by using a mixed solvent comprising hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic solvents and or water as a solvent for resolution, the optical purity of ICPA obtained improves, the amount of solvent used can be decreased, and besides that, if PTE used is of low optical purity, there is not a lowering in the filterability of the salt crystal Japanese Patent Application Kokai Laid open No. 136245 1980 . In the course of a further study on a method for the optical resolution of ICPA, the present inventors found that, in the combination of ICPA andPTE, a complex salt is formed at a 1 1 1 1 molar ratio of ICPA ICPA PTE PTE, said salt is easy to deposit as crystal because of its low solubility, and that the presence of said salt makes the filterability of the salt crystal markedly poor in the operation of optical resolution. This means that In the resolution of ICPA, the use of PTE of low optical purity produces the above complex salt corresponding to the amount of coexisting PTE, and because of said salt being lower in solubility than the ICPA PTE salt and easy to deposit as crystal, it results that when the crystal portion is collected by filtration and decomposed, ICPA of lowered optical purity is obtained and for the same reason, it is also difficult to obtain ICPA in high purity and high yield by recrystallization. As a result of an extensive study based on this novel fact, the present inventors found that, by carrying out the optical resolution of ICPA with PTE of 95 or more in optical purity, ICPA of high optical purity can be obtained in high yield without special purification and also with a good filterability of the crystal. The present inventors thus attained to the present invention. Next, the method of the present invention will be illustrated in detail. ICPA and PTE each has one asymmetric carbon atom in the molecule, and there are four optical isomers for the salt.Hereinafter, four said optical isomers are abbreviated as follows EMI4.1 tb SEP ICPA SEP SEP PTE SEP salt SEP SEP tb ICPA PTE SEP salt tb ICPA PTE SEP salt tb ICPA PTE SEP salt tb Of four these isomers, and are enantiomeric to each other, and the same applies also to and . When a mixture of the same amounts of and is recrystallized, a racemic compound is produced, and similarly, the same amounts of and also produce the same racemic compound.From the powder X ray diffraction patterns in Figs. 2 to 5 shown later and infrared absorption spectra, this compound turned out to be a complex salt comprising ICPA, ICPA, PTE and PTE, different compounds from the materials described above, in a molar ratio of 1 hereinafter, said complex salt is abbreviated as . From other combinations of two isomers than those described above, that is, from those of and , and , and and and , the formation of complex salt is not found.As shown in Fig. 1, with respect to the solubility of said complex salt, has the smallest solubility in, for example, a 90 methanol solvent containing 108 of water 1 and has the largest solubility in such solvent, which is much different from those of and . This tendency is also the same with other solvents. We find therefore that, provided that the optical purity of the PTE or PTE is sufficiently high to avoid significant formation of the abovementioned enantiomeric isomers of ICPA PTE and so prevent crystallization of the abovementioned racemic 1 1 1 1 complex compounds , then a ICPA PTE or ICPA PTE salt of high optical purity can be obtained. Thus, where the purity of the PTE or PTE is at least 95 , then the corresponding optically active salt can be obtained in high purity. There is thus no need for repeated purification of the optically active PTE before it is employed in an optical resolution method of the present invention. Typically the optically active PTE may have an optical purity within the range 95 98.5 . Next, the operating condition of the present invention will be illustrated with reference to a method to obtain ICPA using PTE. First, ICPA is reacted with PTE to form a salt. As to the optical purity of PTE used here, the higher, the mo re preferred. Repetition of purification, which is not always advantageous in industry, is necessary to obtain a substantially pure PTE, however, and PTE having an optical purity of not less than 95 , preferably not less than 97 , can be used. The amount of PTE is in a range of 0.5 to 1.0 mole, more preferably 0.6 to 0.8 mole, based on 1 mole of ICPA. A temperature at which said reaction is carried out is optional, but for raising the optical purity of ICPA to a higher level, it is preferred to once heat to 400C to 1500C and maintain the temperature on or after the reaction. On On said reaction, the use of inert solvent is preferred in carrying out the reaction smoothly, but it is not always necessary for the solvent to be the same as that used on crystallization and separation described later. On said reaction, if the heating and temperature maintenance are once carried out, it is not always necessary for the salt to be in complete solution. Next, the ICPA PTE salt thus formed is crystallized in the solvent. In this case, it is preferred that the solution is cooled slowly. As the solvent used on this crystallization, there may be given for example lower alcohols such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, n propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, sec butyl alcohol, tert butyl alcohol, etc., and lower aliphatic ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, etc. These solvents may be used in a mixture with water. Further, these alcohols, ketones and their mixtures with water may be used in mixtures with aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene , aliphatic ones e.g. hexane, heptane, octane , alicyclic ones e.g. cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane or halogenated ones e.g. chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, chlorobenzene . The amount of the solvent is preferably 1 to 15 times by weight. A temperature at which this crystallization is carried out is 0 C to 600C, more preferably 100C to 300C. Next, the crystallized salt crystal is separated from the mother liquor by means such as filtration, decantation and the like. The crystal of salt thus obtained may be directly used as a material of the production of the ICPA ester, but it is preferred to decompose the salt into ICPA or its alkali salt by the usual method with an acid e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or an alkali e.g.sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide , and then to convert the ICPA or alkali salt to the ester of ICPA. The ICPA obtained by the method above, even by itself, has a sufficiently high optical purity, but if necessary, its optical purity may be heightened by recrystallization on the stage of the salt or after decomposition of the salt into ICPA. When ICPA of high optical purity is required, this object can be attained, as a matter of course, by carrying out completely the same operation using PTE of not less than 95 in optical purity. Next, the present invention will be illustrated in more detail with reference to the following examples. The ratio of ICPA and PTE in the examples was obtained as follows After decomposing the ICPA PTE salt as usual, said ratio of ICPA was measured by the method described in M. Horiba et al., Agric. Biol. Chem., 43, 2311 1979 and that of PTE by the method described in M. Horiba et al.,Agric. Biol. Chem., 44, 2987 1980 .Example 1 191.40 Grams of 90 methanol containing 10 of water was added to 63.80 g of ICPA, andICPA was dissolved with stirring. Thereafter, 41.21 g of PTE optical purity, 98.4 was added, and the mixture was ref fluxed with heating. After 2 hours refluxing, the reaction solution was cooled at a rate of about 10C 5 minutes, and after the temperature reached 200C, the solution was kept at the same temperature for 1 hour. The deposited crystal was collected by filtration, washed with a suitable amount of 90 methanol and dried to obtain a ICPA PTE salt of the following composition. At the same time, a comparative experiment was carried out in the same manner as above except t lt PTE of 91.6 in optical purity was used in place of the PTE of 98.4 in optical purity.The ICPA PTE salt thus obtained was compared with that obtained above.

After the temperature reached 200C, the reaction solution was kept at the same temperature for 1 hour. The deposited crystal was collected by filtration, washed with a suitable amount of 90 methanol and dried to obtain 17.33 g of a ICPA PTE salt.
