# Method of growing a group III V compound epitaxial second layer from the liquid phase on an Al containing group III V compound layer.

## Abstract
A strip buried double heterostructure laser having a pair of opposite conductivity type, wide bandgap cladding layers separated by a narrower bandgap active region. The active region includes a low loss waveguide layer and contiguous therewith a narrower bandgap active layer in the form of a narrow strip extending along the longitudinal resonator laser axis. Lateral current confinement means, such as reversed biased p n junctions, constrain pumping current in a narrow channel through the active layer. Lasers of this type exhibit relatively high pulsed power outputs e. g., 400 mW , linear L I characteristics, stable fundamental transverse mode and single longitudinal mode oscillation. In another embodiment waveguide layer surfaces adjacent the active layer have distributed feedback gratings. Also described are techniques for shaping the active layer without introducing debilitating defects therein, as well as procedures for LPE growth on Al containing Group III V compound layers which are exposed to processing in the ambient.
