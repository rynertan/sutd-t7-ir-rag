# Liquid dispensing system.

## Abstract
A liquid dispensing system comprises a supply of liquid 121 , a pump 101 , a meter 161 and a plurality of dispensing points or stations, 181 each controlled by a solenoid valve 201 . A control box 281 monitors the meter and controls by electronic means which station is enabled that is, which solenoid valve 201 is opened and displays on a display 261 provided a reading derived from the meter. In one embodiment, selection of a station 181 is effected at the control box but the invention also provides electronic means enabling selection to be effected at each station. The invention does away with the need for a meter at each station and finds application in the dispensing of oil or the like in garage workshops.
