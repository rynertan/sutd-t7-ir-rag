## Description
The present invention relates to a sustained release preparation of interferon for parenteral administration. It is known that interferons are produced in the cells of animals and humans by irritation with virus or any other substance. They are very useful as an agent for inhibiting growth of viruses and as an anti tumor agent. Recently, clinical tests of interferons have been done for investigating the activities against various virus diseases and tumors. It has been expected that the activities are promoted by sustaining the level of the medicament in blood or in lesional regions. However, such a sustained release preparation suitable for parenteral administration has not been found. It is very difficult to sustain the release of interferon by known techniques for release sustaining, because interferon is very unstable not only within the body but also in the preparation. Hence the activity is largely and rapidly decreased by the conventional release sustaining techniques such as heat treatment or irradiation, or by chemical treatments with organic solvents or aldehydes, and further, the conventional interferon preparations contain a very small amount of interferon which is water soluble and hence interferon is easily and rapidly released when administered. Besides, the interferon preparation is a parenteral preparation such as an injection preparation, and hence, there is a problem of accumulation of the carrier within a body when the preparation is administered for a long period of time. From this viewpoint, non biodegradable carried such as silicone which is recently used in some medical sections can not be employed. DE A 31 04 815 describes a process for preparing sustained release compositions wherein the active ingredient is dispersed in, fixed to and encapsulated by a protein. For said process it is essential to denaturize the protein by e.g. heat treatment or freezing and thawing in order to achieve the desired sustained release. On the other hand, the preparation of the present invention is optionally lyophilized. It is well known in the chemical and biological field that lyophilization, which is different to simply freezing, is rather used for drying unstable material like IFN without denaturizing it. US A 4 181 731 describes a composition containing 4 carbamoyl 5 hydroxyimidazole as an active ingredient and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier may be gelatin, a polysaccharide or a synthetic high molecular compound. This reference does not teach or suggest to prepare a sustained release preparation of IFN. WO A 8310198 discloses a preparation which is clearly distinguished form the sustained release preparation of the present invention in that it is an aqueous gel product and hence it is difficult to keep the water soluble IFN stable for a long period of time. In GB A 2042 888 cellulose ether is used as the carrier and the drugs used therein are all low molecular weight compounds and powdery compounds in contrast to IFN. Thus, the technical problem underlying the invention is to provide an improved sustained release preparation of interferon for parenteral administration which can gradually release the active ingredient and can maintain the desired level of the active ingredient in blood or in the lesional region for a long period of time. The sustained release preparation of the present invention comprises interferon as an active ingredient in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable biodegradable protein as carrier, said preparation being in the form of powder particles or in the form of a shaped preparation with the proviso that the form is neither needle like nor bar like. The biodegradable carrier used in the present invention means a carrier which can easily be absorbed or be subjected to enzymatic degradation in the body and can be implanted into the body. Suitable examples of the biodegradable proteins are collagen and gelatin. These substances can be used alone or in combination in view of safety and easy handling, collagen or gelatin or a mixture thereof are used. Collagen is a protein which is a main protein of connective tissue of animals and has less antigenicity, and hence, has widely been used as a safe operation yarn for various medical operations. The collagen may be an atelocollagen having far less antigenicity which is obtained by removing the telopeptide region by treating collagen with an enzyme e.g. pepsin in order to make it safer. Gelatin is a protein derived from collagen. Gelatin is a high molecular weight amphoteric electrolyte which has less antigenicity and properties of convertibility between sol and gel forms and is cheap in cost, and hence it has already been confirmed as a safe substance for medical use. The active ingredient used in the present invention includes an interferon, which may be used alone or in combination with an interferon activator or together with one or more other medical compounds which can show additional or synergistic activities with interferon. The interferon includes α , β , and γ interferons, and a mixture thereof. The ratio of the carrier and the medicament is not critical but, for example, interferon is preferably incorporated in an amount of 10³ to 10⁸ IU per 1 mg of carrier. The sustained release preparation of the present invention can be prepared by the following method. An aqueous solution of interferon is mixed with the biodegradable protein or an aqueous solution thereof. The mixture is homogeneously mixed by stirring while preventing the occurrence of foam as much as possible. The resulting mixture is optionally concentrated at a low temperature and further optionally spray dried or lyophilized. In the preparation, there may optionally be incorporated conventional pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as stabilizers, preservatives, local anesthetic agents, and some agents for aiding formability into special shapes of preparations or for release sustaining of the active ingredient. These additives are not specified. Suitable examples of the agents for aiding formability are methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, glycolic acid lactic acid copolymer, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol or ethyl alcohol. Suitable examples of the agents for aiding release sustaining of the active ingredient are cellulose acetate phthalate, ethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, calcium phosphate, lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer, corn starch, rice starch, potato starch, cellulose or alginates. The preparation thus obtained may be optionally processed so as to make it fit to the desired use. For example, the preparation is pulverized under cooling with dry ice or liquid nitrogen. The powder having a particle size suitable for injection may be suspended in a viscous solvent suitable for injection to give a sustained release suspension for injection. Alternatively, the pulverized preparation and the viscous solvent may be packed in the form of a kit, and both are mixed to prepare a suspension for injection when used. Suitable examples of viscous solvents for injection are vegetable oils e.g. peanut oil, cotton seed oil, sesame oil, castor oil, olive oil, corn oil, iodinated poppy seed oil fatty acids ethyl esters , polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, silicone oil or medium chain fatty acids triglycerides. The preparation of the present invention contains the active ingredient in an amount in which the active ingredient is usually used. For example, interferon is usually contained in an amount of 10⁴ to 10⁹ IU, preferably 10⁵ to 5 x 10⁸ IU, per dosage unit. Besides, the particles of the preparation as prepared by pulverization as mentioned above or by any other conventional pulverization methods may be compressed together with other additives if needed to form some specific shapes, such as needle like or fine bar like shaped preparations diameter about 0.5 mm 1.5 mm, length about 5 mm 15 mm , which can be inserted into the body with a forceps needle for fiberscope, an indwelling needle, or other appropriate administration devices. Alternatively, the powdery preparation is previously entered into a mold, followed by concentrating at a low temperature or by lyophilizing to compress and form into a needle like or a fine bar like shaped preparation. Moreover, the preparations of the present invention may be formed into specific shaped preparations such as pellets, spherical, granular or powdery shaped preparations, which can be implanted into the body or the lesional region during operation. The shapes to be formed may vary depending on the desired use and the desired degree of sustaining of the activity of the medicament. Generally speaking, the larger the shape of the preparation is, the longer is the time for sustaining of activity. All steps for preparing the desired sustained release preparations, carried out under sterile condition because the preparations are used as an injection or for implanting into the body. The present invention is illustrated by the following Experiment and Examples, but should not be construed to be limited thereto.
