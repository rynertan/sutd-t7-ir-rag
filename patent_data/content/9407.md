## Description
D E S C R I P T I O N CUTTING HEAD POSITIONINGMEANS IN OR FOR A GLASS CUTTING MACHINE The object of this invention is to provide improved means for rapidly and accurately positioning one or more cutting heads on the bridge of a sheet glass cutting machine whereby required disposition of the head or heads can be readily obtained according to the manner in which a sheet of glass is to be cut on the bed or table of the machine.The positioning means has particular practical application where computerised programming of the cutting operation is employed for maximum opt imisat ion of the glass sheet and for enabling electronic control of the positioning means to be effected in an automatic manner throughout the cutting operation.The reference to the usual term glass cutting herein means the scribing or scoring of the glass sheet prior to breaking the latter apart into smaller sheets or panes.According to this invention cutting head positioning means in or for a glass cutting machine is characterised by a driven elongate flexible member such as an endless belt which is carried by the bridge of a glass cutting machine so that the flexible member or belt is disposed across the machine bed, the or each cutting head being mounted on the bridge for movement over the machine bed and carrying means operable for engagement with, or disengagement from, the flexible member or belt so that said cutting head can be moved by and with the flexible member or belt on the latter being driven and disengaged therefrom on the head reaching a required position on the bridge.In practice the construction and arrangement may be as follows, reference being had to the accompanying drawings in which FIGURE 1 is a side elevation of a cutting head carried by a cutting machine bridge and shown in relation to the positioning means, FIGURE 2 is a view in the direction of the arrow II of FIGURE 1, on an enlarged scale, FIGURE 3 is a part plan view of the drive to the positioning means, and FIGURE 4 is a side elevation of a cutting head showing an alternative arrangement of the invention.Like parts are designated by the same or similar reference numerals throughout the drawings. In the practical application of the positioning means to a glass cutting machine and in a known manner, the bridge of the latter is arranged to span the bed of the machine widthwise, i.e. in the X direction, and is supported and driven at each side of the bed for travelling movement along the latter, i.e. in the Y direction. Thus the machine can have a single bridge which operates from end to end of a sheet of glass resting on the bed, but if desired, the bridge or more than one bridge may be otherwise arranged in relation to the bed.Referring in particular to FIGURE 1, one of the cutting heads 1 is shown mounted for movement along the bridge 2 and is provided with upper and lower rollers 12 engaging guide rods 21 shown of hexagonal cross section and carried by the main cross member 20 of the bridge 2. The lower part of the cutting head 1 is provided with a foot or holder 13 which carries a cutting tool or wheel 11 of suitable hard material for scribing or scoring glass sheet G on the bed 3 of the machine, the foot 13 being carried by a shaft 14 slidable vertically in the body 10 of the cutting head 1 which shaft 14 is operated by a ram 15 through a compression spring 16 and arm 17 to permit a suitable yielding action of the shaft 14 and foot 13. The bridge member 20 carries a driven endless flexible member shown in the form of a belt 22 and which is arranged to be engaged by upper or lower clamping means 4 carried by the body 10 of the cutting head 1. Each clamping means 4 comprises a pad 41 fixedly carried by the head body 10 and positioned adjacent an outer face of a corresponding run of the belt 22, whilst a co operating clamping member 40 is pivotally carried at 42 by the body 10 for contact with the inner face of the associated belt run see BIGUBE 2 .Means is provided for bringing a friction element or shoe 43 of one or the other of the clamping members 40 into contact with its respective belt run for gripping the latter between the shoe 43 and the pad 41 so that the cutting head 1 is thereby engaged with the belt run, according to the direction of required movement of the cutting head 1 along the bridge member 20.In the example shown the clamping members 40 are actuated by a lever 44 pivoted at 45 on the body 10, which lever 44 is in turn operated by one or the other of a pair of solenoids 46 according to required clamping member operation, the solenoids 46 being shown carried by bracket structure 47 from the body 10 of the head 1 and which also carries the ram 15. Other means such as pneumatic or hydraulic rams may be used in place of the solenoids 46. The clamping members 40 are also shown connected by a tension spring 48 to obtain their retraction from the runs of the belt 22 when the lever 44 is in the central or neutral position and also to obtain contact of further or inner friction elements or shoes 49 with a flange or rail 23 fast on the bridge member 20 so that, on release of the clamping members 40 from the belt runs, the shoes 49 immediately grip the rail 23 to firmly retain the cutting head 1 in the required position along the bridge member 20.Referring to FIGURE 3 the belt 22 passes about a roller or pulley 24 at or adjacent each end of the bridge 2 and shown rotatably mounted from the bridge member 20. The belt 22 is directly frictionally driven by a capstan 25 which in turn is directly driven by a stepping motor 26 for controlled drive of the belt 22.In a typical arrangement the bridge member 20 may carry eight cutting heads 1 which are initially grouped four adjacent one end of the bridge 2 and the other four adjacent the other end. By suitable control of the solenoids 46 of each head 1, the heads of one group are brought into engagement as required with the upper run of the belt 22 and the heads 1 of the other group with the lower run of the belt so that when the belt is driven, the heads of one group are moved towards the heads of the other in rapidly obtaining their distributed positioning along the bridge 2 in accordance with glass cutting requirements. For maximum optimisation of a sheet of glass in obtaining a number of smaller sheets or panes therefrom, the appropriate cutting programme is determined by a computer from which a tape or the like is prepared for operating electronic control means such as a micro3processor for the required operation of the stepping motor 26 driving the belt 22 and the cutting head solenoids 46.For initial or coarse setting of each head 1 the motor drive to the belt 22 may be increased or ramped up and then slowed down as the required position of the head 1 is approached. Final accurate positioning of the head 1 by the control means is determined by the co operation of a photo electric cell or similar device not shown carried by the cutting head body 10 and co operating with a linear optical grating or comb 27 shown carried by the lower part of the bridge member 20. When brought and clamped in the required position of use, the cutting wheels 11 of the cutting heads 1 perform scribing of the glass G in a longitudinal or Y direction.Transverse scribing of the glass in the X direction or Z direction when not fully across the glass is effected by usually a single cutting head not shown carried by guide rods 210 on the opposite side of the bridge member 20, which cutting head is secured or engaged in a permanent manner with an appropriate run of a further endless belt 220 on that side of the bridge member 20 and parallel with the belt 22. In a similar manner the belt 220 is driven by capstan drive 28 from a stepping motor 29, so that the belt 220 drives the head for transverse scribing operation.After a transverse scribing has been effected, the cutting tools 11 of the cutting heads 1 are temporarily raised from contact with the glass G just before the transverse scribing so as to move clear over the latter before return to contact with the glass a short distance further on. In this way suit able clearance of a millimetre or so is provided between the longitudinal or Y scribing and the transverse or X scribing, so that suitable parting of the glass is obtained when the smaller sheets are broken away at the scribe lines.Here again operation of the heads 1 in this way is controlled by the electronic control means.Whereas the belt 22 provides a simple and convenient means for effecting movement of the cutting heads 1, other preferably endless elongate flexible members may be employed such as chain, cable or cord, with suitable clamping or other means for dis engageable engagement of the heads 1 therewith.In an alternative arrangement shown in FIGURE 4 the head 1 is carried for movement alQng the bridge on or by guide rods 211, 212 of the latter and is shown supported on the lower guide rod 211 by a bearing block 18 secured to the body 100 of the head 1, the upper guide rod 212 being received between upstanding rollers 120 on a bracket 19 secured to the body 100. The clamping means 4 comprises structure in the form of a channel section member 400 fixed on the body 100 of the head 1 and providing internal surfaces or pads 410, and a pair of oppositely acting pneumatic rams 460 mounted within the member 400. The runs of the belt 22 pass between corresponding clamping members or shoes 430 of the rams 460 whereby on appropriate operation of the latter one or the other of the belt runs can be gripped between a respective co operating shoe 430 and pad 410 according to the required direction of movement of the head 1 on the bridge. A further similar ram not shown on the head body 100 is provided for clamping onto a longitudinal member or rail of the bridge in order to retain the head 1 in the required position on the bridge after release from the belt 22.The head body 100 is also shown carrying guide pins 122 e.g. in the form of nylon sleeved screws for supporting corresponding runs of the belt 22 in relation to respective pads 410 and clamping shoes 430.
