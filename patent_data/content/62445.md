# Method of developing electrostatic images.

## Abstract
In developing an electrostatic image by bringing an elec trostatic image carrying surface of a substrate 5 into sliding contact with a magnetic brush of a developer formed on a de veloper feeding sleeve 2 having a magnet 1 arranged in the interior thereof, problems associated with earing of the mag netic brush are overcome by forming the magnetic brush from an earing promoting component 4 comprising particles hav ing a diameter of 70 to 300 microns of a dispersion of a powder of a magnetic material in a resin and a developer component 3 comprising particles having a diameter of 5 to 50 microns of a dispersion of a powder of a magnetic material in a binder me dium.
