# Gas laser device.

## Abstract
A gas laser device has an anode 3 63 73 83 and a ca thode arranged oppositely in a discharge tube 2 . The cathode comprises a plurality of cathode members 4, 5 50A 50F 60A 60F 70A 70F 84, 85 each having a predetermined dis charge effective cathode surface and each being electrically isolated from others. A switching circuit 24 24 selects the cathode member s used for a continuous wave oscillation and the cathode member s used for a pulsed oscillation. The total area of the discharge effective cathode surface s of the cath ode member s used for the pulsed oscillation is selected to be smaller than, preferably 1 3 to 1 2 of that of the discharge ef fective cathode surface s of the cathode member s used for the continuous wave oscillation.
