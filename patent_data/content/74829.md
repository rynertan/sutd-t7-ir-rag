# A SYSTEM FOR MOVING A MEMBER

## Abstract
A system for moving a member such as a robotics arm, includes a motor 1 for moving the member, a position indicating encoder 5 for producing an indication related to the position of the member, valves 7, 8 which in a first condition enable the motor to move the member in a first direction, in a second condition enable the motor to move the member in the opposite direction, and in a third condition disable the motor from moving the member, and a computer 6 for controlling the valves in positioning the member. The valves are effectively on off valves.
