# ADVANCED MEDICAL ROBOT

## Abstract
An automatic device, such as a robot for moving a medical effector in close proximity to a portion of a living body, such as the limb of a patient. In one form, electronic sensing means senses a physiologic or morphologic condi tion of a patient to whose limb or body the medical effector is in close proximity and generates signals which are applied to the inputs of a computer or microelectronic processor, which electrically processes and analyses such signals and gener ates control signals for controlling the operation of the robot to move the medical effector so as to achieve a desired diagnostic or therapeutic effect.
