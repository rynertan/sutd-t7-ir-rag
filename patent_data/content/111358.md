## Description
Short title Press for dumping matter, more particularly domestic rubbish. domestic rubbish. The invention relates to a device for collecting and compressing dumping matter in a bag, more particularly domestic rubbish, comprising a bag carrier and a compression stamp vertically movable in the open bag. Such a device is known. The known device has the disadvantage that when humid matter, for example, peels, table residues, catheter bags and the like are collected and compressed in a bag, the amount of moisture in the bag becomes so large that the effective space for receiving dry matter becomes impermissibly small, whilst in addition the overall weight of the filled bag becomes so heavy that there is a risk of cracking in transporting or handling. For evacuating the moisture it has been proposed to perforate the bag on the underside before placing it in the device. In a device of this kind the carrying bottom for the bag is provided with means for conducting away leaking water. It will be obvious that such a perforated bag has a drastically reduced strength and that during subsequent handling or transporting leakages cannot be avoided. The invention has for its object to obviate the disadvantages of the prior art and provides for this purpose a device of the kind set forth in the preamble, which comprises a suction duct that can be lowered into the bag for evacuating moisture pressed out of the rubbish. In a preferred embodiment the device according to the invention is provided with a sleeve operating as a compression cylinder, around which the bag can be arranged.The suction duct extends down to the lower edge of the sleeve, is in open communication at least at the lower end with the space within the sleeve and extends by its top end to near or above the top edge of the sleeve, at which end the duct can be connected with a suction compression system. Preferably the suction duct is formed by a perforated ring duct arranged on or near the lower edge of the sleeve around the outer side of said sleeve, at least one of which duct can be connected with the suction system. The advantage of.such a configuration is that with great reliability all moisture accumulated even in corners can be removed, whilst in addition the bag is held at a distance from the sleeve. In order to prevent the perforations from being jammed by the bag being drawn thereto by suction, the perforations of the ring duct are preferably located in the wall part of said duct facing the sleeve. In a variant the suction duct may be fastened to the compression stamp. It will be obvious that a combination of the aforesaid, differently positioned suction ducts is also possible. In order to ensure ready accessibility to the opened bag the device may advantageously have the feature that both the sleeve and the compression stamp are coupled for the vertical displacement with their own hydraulic or pneumatic ram with a piston, whilst the compression stamp and the ram thereof are horizontally displaceable with respect to the sleeve after the compression stamp is removed from the sleeve. In a further variant the device embodying the invention has the particular feature that in its topmost position the compression stamp is received in a cover fitting to the sleeve and having a semi circular hanging rim, which together with a semi circular standing rim on the sleeve constitutes a circular rim. With this design it is ensured that the vertical end edges of the semi circular rims operate as stops to obtain accurate positioning of the compression stamp above the sleeve, whilst injury of the user of the device at the downward movement of the compression stamp is excluded. When the sleeve is drawn out of the bag, the bag has to be prevented from moving simultaneously upwards. The device embodying the invention can be constructed so that the driving mechanisms for the sleeve and the compression stamp are provided with relatively co operating locking members, which permit of drawing the sleeve out of the bag cont√Öaining compressed rubbish, whereas the compression stamp retains the bag with the rubbish. Preferably the suction duct of the suction compression system includes a fluid collecting chamber which communicates through a duct with a non return valve blocking towards said chamber with an outlet duct, whilst the chamber is connected with the suction compression system through a duct that can be closed by a float. The invention will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings. The drawings shown in Fig. 1 a perspective view of a device embodying the invention, Fig. 2 a shematic sectional view of the device of Fig. 1 in the operational position, Fig. 3 an elevational view corresponding toFig. 2 in a free position. Fig. 4 a sleeve with a cover, Fig. 5 a detail of the device of Fig. 1, Fig. 6 a further detail of the device of Fig. 1, Fig. 7 a shematic cross sectional view of a draining device, Fig. 8 a fragmentary, perspective view of a variant and Fig. 9 a drastically simplified hydraulicdiagram associated with the device embodying the invention. Fig. 1 shows a device 1 for collecting and compressing refuse in a bag 2. The device 1 comprises in this embodiment also a device 3 for compressing and baling dry refuse. With the device 3 is connected a device 4 which embodies the invention. This device 4 comprises a frame 5, which can be vertically slid along a post 6 coupled with the device 3 under the control of a hydraulic ram 7. The frame 5 has a hinge 8, which supports an auxiliary frame 9, to which a second hydraulic ram 10 is fastened. The auxiliary frame 9 has a cover 11 to be described hereinafter, in which in the position shown in Fig. 1 a compression stamp is located, which can be driven by actuating the second hydraulic ram 10.A tensile spring 12 draws the auxiliary frame into an outwardly deflected rest position in which the opened bag is accessible.For exerting the pressure on the refuse in the bag the auxiliary frame 9 is manually moved into the position shown in Fig. 1, after which the compression stamp can move downwards. It will be obvious that the foregoing is performed in the lowermost position of the auxiliary frame 9. The post 5 carries a sleeve 13 having a smaller circumference than the opened bag 2. Therefore, the bag 2 can be readily slid in the direction of the arrow 14 upwards onto the sl eve 13. At the lower edge, on the outer side, the sleeve 13 has a perforated suction duct 15, which communicates through vertical ducts 16, 17 with a manifold 18, which communicates, in turn through a hose 19 with a suction device device 20. Fig. 2 shows the arrangement in the situation in which the sleeve 13 is lowered in the bag 2 and the hydraulic ram 10 is energized so that a compression stamp 21 has moved down for consolidating and squeezing rubbish 22. During energization of the hydraulic ram 10 in this sense the suction device 20 is also energized so that the moisture squeezed out is evacuated through the suction duct 15 from the bag 2. The hydraulic ram 10 can only be energized when the frame 9 is in the position shown. For this purpose a switch 23 is provided on the top side of the hinge 8, which switch closes the current circuit concerned only when said position is reached. Fig. 4 shows the stainless steel sleeve 13, at the lower edge of which the suction duct 5 is arranged and around which the bag 2 is placed. This bag 2 is carried by the bottom plate 24 of the device 4. The sleeve has a semicircular, standing rim 25, which together with a hanging rim 26 of the cover 11 constitutes a circular rim in the closed state see Figs. 1, 2 and 3 . Fig. 5 shows the place of the perforations 27 in the suction duct 15. The position of the perforations 27 is such that the bag 2 can never block the perforations. For this purpose they are provided in the wall part of the duct 15 facing the sleeve 13. Fig. 6 shows the manifold 18 with the duct portions 16, 17. The arrows 28 indicate how during compression of the rubbish and the evacuation of moisture squeezed out air can enter so that subatmospheric pressure will not occur in the bag 2. The solution illustrated in Fig. 6 shows an analogy to the position of the perforations 27 of Fig. 5.In both cases a path is kept free for displacing fluid and air. Fig. 7 shows the suction device 20. It comprises a suction compression system 29 including a motor 30 and a fluid collecting chamber 31, which is connected through a duct 32 including a non return valve 33 closing towards the chamber 31 with an outlet duct 34. The chamber 31 communicates with the suction compression system 29 through a duct 35, which can be closed by a float 36, in order to avoid evacuation of fluid through the suction compression system 29.The system 29 creates a subatmospheric pressure by pressing out air contained in the chamber 31 through perforations 37. The non return valve 33 is formed by a tube 38 with two rings 39, 40 serving as a valve seat for a ball 41 and as a locking member respectively. When the energization of the motor 30 is obviated, the subatmospheric pressure in the chamber 31 is levelled out so that the ball 41 will bear on the ring 40 and the fluid in the chamber 31 can flow towards the duct 34 through perforations 42 provided in the tube 38 between the rings 39 and 40. Fig. 8 shows a detail of a variant in which not only the sleeve 13 but also the compression stamp 21 is provided with a suction duct 43. This suction duct 43 is an annular duct having a plurality of perforations at equal intervals. With the suction duct 43 communicate two duct portions 44, 45, which communicate in a manner not shown with a suction device in analogy with the statements made with reference to Fig. 1 for the suction duct 15. It is noted that a cover 46 of the same general shape as the cover 11 described above has two passages 47, 48 for the duct portions 44, 45, since the latter have, of course, to be displaceable up and down with the stamp 21. The duct portions 44, 45 are connected with a manifold 49 similar to the manifold 18 described above. The manifolds 18 and 49 are interconnected by a hose 50. Fig. 9 shows a drastically simplified hydraulic diagram of the device 1. The driving mechanisms for the sleeve 13 and the compression stamp 21 are provided with relatively co operating locking members, which permit of drawing the sleeve 13 out of the bag 2 filled with compressed rubbish, whilst the compression stamp 21 retains the bag 2 with the rubbish. The rams 10 and 7 are controlled through a valve 51 and 52 respectively. A three way cock 54 controlled by a pressure sensor 53 responding to 30 atms can connect the return duct 55 of the ram 10 with the change over valve 56 so that the return fluid of the ram 10 is supplied to the hydraulic ram 7. A second pressure sensor 57 responds to a pressure of 100 atms. After the response the energization of the ram 10 and hence the downward movement of the compression stamp 21 is stopped. The sensor 53 furthermore controls the change over valve 56 so that at the response of the sensor 53 the return duct 55 of the ram 10 is connected with the inlet duct 58 of the ram 7. As a result the plungers of the rams 10, 7 move one with the other so that the compression stamp 21 remains standing on the rubbish in its pressing position, whereas the sleeve 13 is drawn out of the bag 2. The switch 23 is included in the electric conductor for energizing the valve 51. There is not shown a switch coupled with the switch 23 for actuating the suction device 20. It is thus ensured that directly when the cover 11 is put in the closed position the suction device becomes operative. The switch 23 serves as a safety member. It prevents the compression stamp 21 from moving downwards before the cover 11 is in the closed position. A selector switch 59 serves for the selective energization of the ram 10 or 7 respectively. As stated above, the rams 10 and 7 may be simultaneously energized,Since under these conditions the rams are connected in series, it is sufficient to use a relatively small size pump 60. A push button 61 has to be manually operated, whilst the user swings by the other hand the auxiliary frame 9 into the operative position so that the current circuit for energizing the ram 51 can be closed. When the selector switch 59 is put in a second position the stamp 21 moves again downwards after depression of the push button 61. At the contact with the rubbish the pressure will increase. At a transgression of the response value of the pressure sensor 53 the ram 7 is, in addition, energized in the manner described above. Thus the frame 5 is moved upwards along the post 6. The sleeve 13 moves.up wards, whereas the stamp 21 holds the bag in its position. When the lower edge of the sleeve 13 has reached the same level as the compression stamp 21 the ram 10 has reached its final position, after which the pressure drops and the ram 7 is energized by the full pressure until it reaches its final position. In this situation see Fig. 1 a new bag can be slipped around the sleeve 13 in the direction of the arrow 14.A foot switch 62 serves to move the sleeve 13 with the surrounding bag downwards by actuating the ram 7 in the correct direction.
