# Method of surface treatment of porous material.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a method of the surface treatment of a porous material. The porous material is electrolysed in an aqueous solution of at least one metal salt of thio acid to impregnate the porous material with the metallic sulfide. Optionally, the porous material may be immersed alternately in an aqueous solution of at least one metal salt of thio acid and an acid aqueous solution after the electrolysis to further impregnate the porous material with the metallic sulfide.
