# Duplex cross point switch.

## Abstract
A full duplex one sided switching chip switches exter nally connected lines as input output pairs and pairs of bi directional interconnection lines. Duplex cross points selec tively connect input output line pairs to the interconnection line pairs. The interconnection lines can be coupled to inter connection lines on other chips for multi chip switching ar rays.
