# Composite sheets.

## Abstract
Certain adhesive compositions which are soluble in organic solvents and insoluble in water but activatable thereby are useful in adhering transparent polymeric foils especially energy control sheets to glass. The adhesives, which comprise a blend of a methyl vinyl ether maleic anhydride copolymers or half esters thereof and b polyfunctional epoxide or aziridine crosslinker, impart excellent moisture resistance to laminates.
