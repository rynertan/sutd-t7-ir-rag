## Description
BLENDS OF POLYETHERIMIDE AND POLYACRYLATE ELASTOMERS This invention is concerned with a new class of polyetherimide polyacrylate blends. These blends exhibit higher impact strengths than those associated with the polyetherimide component of the blends. The novel polyetherimide polyacrylate elastomer blends comprise A a polyetherimide of the formulaEMI1.1 wherein a represents a whole number in excess of 1 e.c from 10 to about 10,000 or more , and Z is a member of the class consisting of 1 .EMI1.2 and 2 divalent organic radicals of the general formula EMI2.1 where X is a member selected from the class consisting of divalent radicals of the formulasEMI2.2 0 and Swhere q is 0 or 1, y is a whole number from l to about 5, the divalent bonds of the O Z O radical being situated on the phthalic anhydride end groups, e.g., in the 3,3 , 3,4 , 4,3 , or the 4,4 positions and R is a divalent organic radical selected from the class consisting of a aromatic hydrocarbon radicals having from 6 to about 20 carbon atoms and halogenated derivatives thereof, b alkylene radicals and cycloalkylene radicals having from 2 to about 20 carbon atoms, C 2 8 alkylene terminated polydiorganosiloxanes, and c divalent radicals included by the formulaEMI2.3 where Q is a member selected from the class consisting ofEMI2.4 and CxH2x where is a whole number from 1 to about 5 inclusive, and B a polyacrylate elastomer. The polyacrylate elastomers employed in the blends of this invention are homo or copolymers of lower alkyl esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid, wherein the alkyl groups contain from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms, preferably from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms. Examples of such elastomers include polymers of ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, octyl methacrylate and the like, and copolymers or terpolymers thereof.Preferred polymers are polyethylacrylate or polyethylacrylate polybutylacrylate copolymers. These polymers and methods for their production are well known. These polyacrylate elastomers are presently commercially available products, and a preferred elastomer is a polyethylacrylate which can be obtained, for example, from B.F. Goodrich Company Chemical Group,Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A. under the trademark, Hycar 4004. Bycar 4004 is characterized by a Mooney Viscosity ML 4, 1000C. of 30, a glass transition temperature of 41.0 C and a refractive index at 20 C. of 1.466. The polyetherimides described above can be obtained by any of the methods well known to those skilled in the art, including the reaction of aromatic bis ether anhydrides of the formulaEMI3.1 where.Z is defined as above, with an organic diamine of the formula H2N R NH2 where R is as defined above. In general, the reactions can be advantageously carried out employing well known solvents, e.g., o dichlorobenzene, m cresol toluene, and the like, at elevated temperatures from about 100 C to about 250we. Alternatively, the polyetherimides can be prepared by melt polymerization of an aromatic bis ether anhydride with an organic diamine, as described above, while heating the mixture of the ingredients to an elevated temperature with concurrent mixing.Generally, melt polymerization temperatures between about 200 to about 400 C. and preferably about 230 C. to about 300 C. can be employed. Any order of addition of chain stoppers ordinarily employed in melt polymerization can be employed. The conditions of the reaction and the proportions of ingredients can be varied widely depending on the molecular weight, intrinsic viscosity, and solvent resistance. In general equimolar amounts of organic diamine and bis ether anhydride are employed for high molecular weight polyetherimides. However, in certain instances, a slight molar excess about 1 to 5 mole of diamine can be employed, resulting in the production of polyetherimides having terminal amine groups. Generally useful polyetherimides hereinafter sometimes referred to as PEl have an intrinsic viscosity greater than 0.2 deciliters per gram, preferably 0.3 to 0.60, or 0.7 deciliters per gram or even higher when measured in mcresol at 25 C.

Org.Khin., 4 5 , 774 1968 . The organic diamines include, for example, m phenylenediamine, p phenylenediamine, 4 4 diaminodiphenylpropane, 4 4 diaminodiphenylmethane, benzidine, 4,4 diarninodiphenyl sulfide, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulfone, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether, 1,5 diaminophthalene, 3,3 dimethylbenzidine, 3,3 dimethoxybenzidine, 2,4 bis B amino t butyl toluene, bis p ss amino t butylphenyl ether, bis p ss methyl o aminopentyl benzine, 1,3 diamino 4 isopropylbenzene, 1,2 bis 3 aminopropoxy ethane, m xylylenediamine, p xylylenediamine, 2,4 diaminotoluene, 2,6 diaminotoluene, bis 4 aminocyclohexyl methane, 3 methylheptamethylenediamine, 4,4 dimethylheptamethylenediamine, 2,ll dodecanediamine, 2,2 dimethylpropylenediamine, octamethylenediamine, 3 methoxyhexamethylenediamine, 2,5 dimethylhexamethylenediamine, 2,5 dimethylheptamethylenediamine, 3 methYlheptamethylenediamine, 5 methylnonamethylenediamine, 1, 4 cyclohexanediamine, 1,12 octadecanediamine, bis 3 aminopropyl sulfide,N methyl bist3 aminopropyl amine, hexamethylenediamine, heptamethylenediamine, nonamethylenediamine, decamethylenediamine, bis 3 aminopropyl tetramethyldisiloxane, bis 4 amiobutyl tetramethyldisiloxane, etc., and mixtures of such diamines. The polyetherimides and polyacrylate elastomers are compatible with each other within the ranges of proportions contemplated in the present invention.Generally, the blends of this invention employ from about 3 wt. to about 15 wt. polyacrylate elastomer, the balance being essentially polyetherimide. In preferred blends, the concentration of polyacrylate elastomer ranges from about 58 to about 12 by wt., most preferably about 10 by wt. .Blends within these proportions have been found to have improved impact strengths, as compared to unmodified polyetherimides. The following examples further illustrate the present invention, but are not intended to be limiting. Example I 10 parts of polyetherimide of the above formula, wherein Z represents a group of the formulaEMI7.1 the phthalic anhydride groups are substituted in the 4,4 positions, and R represents m phenylene were mixed with I part of polyacrylate elastomer, which was a polyethylacrylate obtained from Goodrich Chemical Group,Cleveland, Ohio as Hycaro 4004. These polymers were mixed by melting the polyetherimide in a blade type mixer and then lowering the temperature to just above the glass transition temperature. At this point, the polyacrylate elastomer was added and the material blended. The resulting blend was then compression molded into 1 8 inch sheets These sheets were cut into bars measuring 2 1 2 inches by 1 2 inch, which were notched and tested by the standard notched Izod impact test.Unmodified polyetherimide of the same formula was also subjected to this test as a control. The notched Izod test was conducted substantially as described in ASTM test D256, incorporated herein by reference. The impact strength of the polyacrylate polyetherimide blend was determined to be 1.1 and 1.4 foot pounds per inch in duplicate runs, whereas the impact strength of the unmodified polyetherimide was determined to be 0.6 and 0.7 foot pounds per inch in duplicate runs. The glass transition temperatures Tg of the unmodified polyetherimide and the polyacrylate polyetherimide blend were measured to be 214 C. in in all samples. The single glass transition temperature is an indication of compatibility between the two polymers. Example II Film castings of blends of polyetherimide and the polyacrylate elastomer described in Example I were prepared by preparing a 10 chloroform solution of the polyetherimide and a 1 chloroform solution of the polyacrylate Hycare 4004, B. F. Goodrich and mixing them in equal volumes to form a 10 1 wt. wt. ratio. A film was cast by spreading the solution on a Mylare sheet followed by air evaporation of the solvent. The resulting film was removed from the Mylar and was inspected. The film was transparent, evidencing compatibility of the two polymers. Example III Solution blends of polyetherimide and an acrylic ester copolymer of ethylacrylate and butylacrylate Hycar 4051CG, B.F. Goodrich were prepared by the procedure described in Example II. The polyacrylate used had a Mooney Viscosity ML 4 100 C of 32, a glass transition temperature of 15,O C. and a refractive index 20 C. of 1.469. The resulting film was clear, evidencing compatibility, and somewhat tacky.
