## Claims
CLAIM A device for allowing manual rotation of an axial slack adjuster 4 on a railway vehicle by linear operational movement, characterized by a sleeve 1 to be coaxially attached to the slack adjuster 4 , a collar 2 coaxially mounted on the sleeve for rotation only and provided with means 8 for pivotal connection to an operational rod 10 , and a locking spring. 3 coaxially mounted between the sleeve and the collar for allowing relative rotation of these members in one direction only.

## Description
A device at a railway vehicle slack adjusterTechnical Field This invention relates to a device for allowing manual rotation of an axial slack adjuster on a railway vehicle by linear operational movement.Background Art A so called axial slack adjuster is normally incorporated in the brake rigging underneath a railway vehicle. Occasionally, for example at the replacement of worn out brake blocks, it is required to manually operate the adjuster for restoring its length to the original value. This may normally be accomplished by manual rotation of the adjuster housing or barrel. As the adjuster is mounted underneath the vehicle, often in a position where it is difficult to reach, it is desired to effect the rotational movement from the side of the vehicle, preferably by linear movement back and forth of a handle or the like. It is of course imperative that the normal function of the adjuster is not impaired in any way by a device for manual rotation. Some slack adjusters have barrels rotating at normal operation.There is, however, a tendency towards a type where the adjuster barrel is not rotating, whereas the manual adjustment may be brought about by rotation after a certain rotational lock within the adjuster has been overcome.The Invention A device for remote manual rotation of a slack adjuster of the type with non rotating barrel consists according to the invention of a sleeve to be coaxially attached to the slack adjuster, a collar coaxially mounted on the sleeve for rotation only and provided with means for pivotal connection to an operational rod, and a locking spring coaxially mounted between the sleeve and the collar for allowing relative rotation of these members in one direction only. The operational rod extends preferably to the side of the vehicle and may there be connected to a handle arrangement for easy operation, for example by pumping motion. The rod may, within the scope of the protection, be replaced by equivalent means, for example a wire with spring return.Brief Description of the Drawing The invention will be described in further detail below reference being made to the accompanying drawing, in which Fig. 1 is a side view, partly sectional, of a device according to the invention and Fig. 2 is an end view of the device, a slack adjuster being indicated with a dash dotted line.Description of a Preferred Embodiment As is well known in the railway braking art, the brake rigging underneath a railway vehicle generally includes a slack adjuster, in most cases of the so called axial type. Occasionally it is required to operate the adjuster manually, for example at the replacement of worn out brake blocks, when the adjuster length is to be restored to its original value. In many cases this is accomplished by manual rotation of the adjuster housing or barrel. As the slack adjuster is not readily accessible, it is often desirable to have an arrangement at the side of the vehicle, whereby the slack adjuster housing may be manually rotated without disturbing the normal function of the adjuster. A device for this purpose consists according to the invention mainly of three coaxial parts a sleeve 1, a collar 2 and a locking spring 3. The sleeve 1 is to be attached coaxially on a housing or barrel of an axial slack adjuster. In the present case a slack adjuster 4, as indicated with dash dotted lines in Fig. 2, has a cross sectional shape with diametrically opposed rims 4 , The sleeve 1 has an inner cross sectional shape corresponding thereto and is provided with screws 4 for its secure attachment to these rims 4 . The collar 2 is rotatably arranged on the sleeve 1 but is held against axial movements by means of a locking ring 6. Towards its end o it is provided with sealing rings 7 for preventing the intrusion of dirt, moisture and the like. An ear 8 with a hole 9 is fixed to the collar 2. The locking spring 3 is arranged as shown coaxially between the sleeve 1 and the collar 2 so as only to allow relative rotation between these two parts in one direction, as is well known to any person skilled in the art. If as indicated in Fig. 2 the described device is attached to a slack adjuster 4, and a rod 10, extending to a handle not shown at the side of the railway vehicle, is pivotally attached to the hole 9 in the ear 8, it will be possible to accomplish a manual rotation of the slack adjuster 4 in one, desired direction by operating the handle for moving the rod 10 to and fro in its axial direction as indicated with an arrow in Fig. 2. Modifications are possible within the scope of the appended claim.
