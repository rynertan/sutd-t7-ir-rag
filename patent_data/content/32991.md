## Description
Reversible electrochromic display device.The invention relates to an improved reversible electrochromic display device. The device is characterized by having a polymer film with electrochromic active molecules bonded thereto and having incorporated therein a non electroactive ionic salt as a dopant, coated on a viewing electrode.The use of organic materials in electrochromic display devices has been encouraged because of their potential low cost, and low power requirements.However, the potential of these devices have not yet been realized.A review of organic electrochromic devices can be found in the publication entitled NonemissiveElectrooptic Displays, A. R. Kmetz and F. K.vonWillisen Editors , Plenum Press, New York 1975 . Two types of devices are described in the above mentioned publication and for simplication are classified hereinafter as ClassI and Class II.The simpliest approach to these would be optimal devices in the Class I configuration. In these devices a thin layer electrochemical cell with optically transparent electrodes is filled with a solvent supporting electrolyte and an uncolored organic donor acceptor pair of molecules.These molecules can be reversibly made to form a highly colored oxidant and a reductant at the respective electrode surfaces. Color develops in these cells when a voltage is applied at a particular point on the electrodes to form the colored oxidized and reduced pair Development of color depends on and is limited by, diffusion of the electroactive organic molecules to the electrode surface. The intensity of color is dependent upon and is limited by the molecules extinction coefficient and the solubility in the electrolyte solution. Examples of this class of devices are exhibited in U.S. Pat. No. 3,451,741 and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,093,358 issued June 6, 1978. In the former reference the organic materials used are hydroxyaryl imidazole compounds and in the latter reference, pyrazoline compoundes are used.The latter reference discloses that the use of pyrazonline type compounds gives increased efficiencies.In these Class I devices, after diffusional formation of the colored ions at the respective electrode surface occurs, the colored oxidant and reductant diffuses into the bulk solution in the center of the cell. The colored oppositely charged ions which are formed at the electrode surfaces, annihilate each other vTa electron transfer to reform the uncolored neutral species. Therefore the image persists until this diffusional annihilation occurs. To maintain the desired image requires a refresh process whereby voltage pulses are applied at the desired point on the electrode surfaces to maintain the neutral ionic neutral species creation annihilation cycle.The major disadvantage of Class I devices is that they require a diffusional process in an all solution environment. Because of this process constant cycling is required for memory in the display. Additionally, constant recycle leads to device degradation due to uncontrolled side reactions, sensitivity to solvent contaminants and impurities. Furthermore, the constant recycle program requires energy and does not allow real storage of the displayed information.The Class II devices partially solves some of the problems ascribed to the Class I devices mentioned above.In these devices, after electron transfer at the electrode surface diffusion into the bulk solution is prevented by the production of a colored, ion radical salt on the electrode surface. Typical of Class II devices are thoese disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 3,806,229. The electroactive species used in these devices are viologen acceptor. These devices have the beneficial properLy of meni ry, however, they still involve a diffusional process to form the colored state. Furthermore, reproducible formation of the solid phase on the electrode surface and reproducible removal of this solid phase by voltage reversal result in poor lifetimes for the devices. A detailed discussion of these devices is found in the publication to K. Belinko, Appl. Phys. Letters, 29 p. 363 1976 .More recently in U. S. Pat. No. 4,142,783, assigned to a common assignee, there is taught a novel reversible electrochromic display device.The device is characterized by having a layer of porous polymeric resin or support to which an electrochromic active molecule is bonded, coated on a viewing vehicle.A major drawback associated with the use of polymer films, in general, in electrochromic displays has been their highly insulating behavior.The low ionic conductivity of these films results in two undesirable properties switching speeds are very low in potentiostatic write modes due to low ionic mobilities and to very large uncompensated resistance effects within the film and constant current writing results in catastrophic failure of the film at all but the lowest current densities.The invention as claimed is intended to remedy the above mentioned drawbacks. It solves the problem by using a polymer film with electroactive molecules covalently bonded thereto and having incorporated therein a non electroactive ionic salt as a dopant, coated on a viewing electrode.The advantages offered by the invention are mainly improved switching speeds and stability under constant current writing conditions.The invention, which is defined in the attached claims, is described in detail below with reference to the drawings, in which FIG. 1 shows the potentiostatic write and erase pulses for 5000A films, prepared with and without a non electroactive ionic salt dopant of the present invention.FIG 2 depicts the potential transient accompanying a constant current write pulse of mA in films prepared with solid line and without dotted line a dopant of the present invention.According to the present invention, there is provided an improved electrochromic display device which features a polymeric material film comprising electrochromic active species bonded to a polymer and a dopant incorporated therein. The present invention has all the advantages attendant in the device disclosed in U. S. Pat. No. 4,142,783.In the present invention, as in U. S. Pat. No.4,142,783 the electrochromic coloration reaction can take place due to the giving up or donation of an electron by an electrochromic active donor compound to the viewing electrode. It should be noted that while the invention is described using donor molecules acceptor electrochromic active species can similarly be utilized. The donor molecules that can be used in this invention are those which can be characterized as having the following specific molecular properties a Those that are capable of reversible electron oxidation to a stable radical cation, where the cation absorbs visible light differently from the neutral species b have an oxidation potential of from about 0.1V to about 1V measured against a standard calomel electrode SCE and c must have a functional group which when reacted with a porous polymer support will be bonded thereto. Functional groups contemplated by the present invention include hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino groups and the like.The acceptor molecules that can be used in this invention are those which can be characterized as having the following specific molecular properties a Those that are capable of reversible electron reduction to stable radical anion where the anion absorbs visible light differently from the neutral species b have a reduction potential of from about 0.1V to about 1V measured against standard calomel electrode and c must have a functional group which when reacted with a porous polymer support will be bonded thereto. Functional groups contemplated by the present invention include hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino groups and the like.Typical electroactive acceptor materials which may be used include p tetracyanoquinodimethide TCNQ , p benzoquinone and bis dithiolene nickel.Specifically the preferred acceptors can be selected from hydroxyethyl p tetracyanoquinodimethane, hydroxyphenyl p benzoquinone and carboxy bis dithiolene nickel.Specifically the electrochromic active donor species can be selected from a wide variety of compounds. For the purposes of the present invention trinryl IWrazol ines having hydroxyl, carboxyl or amino groups on the phenyl riny at the 1, 3 or 5 positions can be used, e.g., 1, 3 di p methoxyphenyl 5 p hydroxyphenyl 2 pyrazoline, 1, 5 di p methoxyphenyl 3 p hydroxyphenyl pyrazoline, 3, 5 di p methoxyphenyl 1 p hydroxyphenyl 2 pyrazoline, 1, 3 di p methoxyphenyl 5 p carboxyphenyl 2 pyrazoline, 1, 5 di p methoxyphenyl 3 p carboxyphenyl 2 pyrazoline, 3, 5 di p methoxyphenyl 1 p carboxyphenyl 2 pyrazoline, 1, 3 di p methoxyphenyl 5 p aminophenyl 2 pyrazoline, 1, 5 di phenyl 3 p aminophenyl 2 pyrazoline, 1 p hydroxyphenyl 3 p methoxystyryl 5 p methoxyphenyl 2 pyrazoline, 1, 3 di phenyl 5 p hydroxyphenyl 2 pyrazoline, 1, 3 di phenyl 5 p carboxyphenyl 82 pyrazoline, 1, 3 di phenyl 5 p aminophenyl A2 pyrazoline, 1, p methoxyphenyl 3 morpholino 5 p hydroxy phenyl A 2 pyrazoline, 1, p methoxyphenyl 3 morpholino 5 p carboxy phenyl 2 pyrazoline, 1, p methoxyphenyl 3 morpholino 5 p aminophenyl 2 pyrazoline, l p hydroxyphenyl 3 p diethylaminostryl 5 p diethylaminophenyl 2 pyrazoline, tetrathiafulvalene TTF , its derivatives and Se analogs TSeF and its derivatives. For example, tetrathiafulvalenecarboxylic acid TTFCO2H , tetraselenafulvalenecarboxylic, hydroxymethyl tetrathiafulvalene TTFCH2OH , hydroxymethyl tetraselenafulvalene TSeFCH2OH , p hydroxyphenyl tetrathiafulvalene TTFC6H4OH , p hydroxyphenyl tetraselenafulvalene TSeFC6H4OH , p aminophenyl tetrathiafulvalene TTFC6H4NH2 , p carboxyphenyl tetrathiafulvalene TTFC6H4CO2H . The above compounds are described for purposes of demonstrating the inventors use. It would be obvious to others to use similar compounds meeting the requirements set forth above.The porous polymeric resin may be a homopolymer or copolymer having skeletal functional groups or side chains having functional groups capable of reacting with the functional groups of the electrochromic active molecules thereby binding said molecules thereto. The polymer resin can be linear or cross linked with an appropriate disubstituted monomer to provide a porous insoluble matrix. The amount of crosslinking monomer added during polymerization controls the degree of porosity of the resins. A specific polymeric resin which may be used among others, is a copolymer of styrene and chloromethylated styrene, e.g.EMI9.1 When this polymeric material is used the value of x can be varied to effect the intensity of the colors formed by the electrochromic active molecule. For example, when x ul a large number of molecules are attached to the base polymer resin and are in close proximity to one another thus providing high intensity color when a voltage is applied across the cell.Conversely when x l only a small number of molecules are attached and are widely dispersed, thereby providing low intensity color. Typically, the polymer is either linear, or crosslinked with divinyl benzene from about 0.25 to about 10 .The synthesis of the above compositions are given in U. S. Pat. No. 4,142,783 and are incorporated herein by reference.As is known to the prior art, the electrochromic reaction requires an electrolyte that is soluble in an appropriate solvent. Typical electrolytes that can be used in the present invention are tetrabutylammonium perchlorate Bu4NC104 , perchloric acid HClO4 , sodium fluoroborate NaBF4 , sodium perchlorate NaC104 , sodium hexafluorophosphate NaPF6 , tetraethylammonium fluoroborate Et4NBF4 , tetraethylammonium hexafluorophosphate Et4NPF6 and tetraethylammonium perchlorate Et4NC104 . The solvents which can be used can be protic or aprotic solvents which are polar or non polar. One limiting factor is the solubility of the electrolyte.Typical useful solvents include methyl ethyl ketone, methylene chloride, ethanol, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, N,N dimethylacetomide tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile.The device comprises a cell having at least two electrodes i.e., a working, and a counter electrode.A reference electrode can also be included. The electrodes may be isolated from each other by means of a membrane, such as a porous frit. The working electrode or the electrode on which the electrochromic effect will be produced can be a conductive metal plate e.g., Pt, Au and Cu foils, an optically transparent conductor such as SnO2,InO2, or a conductive film e.g., Pt, Au or mini grid electrodes. The polymeric resin material having electrochromic active molecules attached thereto is coated on the working electrode to produce an electrochromic effect when an electric field is applied across the electrodes. The reference electrode can be the standard calomel cell or other prior art standard electrodes and the counter electrode can be a Pt wire. The coating of the polymer resins can be performed in the followlncj fashion. The crosslinked resin with bound electronctive spocies is swelled in benzene or methylene chloride. This suspension is deposited dropwise onto a transparent electrode. The solvent is allowed to slowly evaporate to give a fairly uniform polymer film with good adhesion characteristics.The linear resin is dissolved in tetrahydrofuran, methylene chloride or cyclopentanone and dropped onto a spinning t3000 RPM transparent electrode.The resulting spin cast film is very uniform and defect free with excellent adhesion characteristics.The non electroactive dopants used in the present invention are of two general types 1 monomeric dopants which leach out into the electrolyte solution and 2 polymer bound ionic dopants polyelectrolytes , which remain within the film. The former function by lowering the polymer density via leaching into the electrolyte solution, thus allowing greater penetration by solvent and greatly enhanced ionic conductivity. The latter function by promoting solvent swelling due to the increased polarity provided by the polymer bound ionic groups, again, increasing the ionic conductivity.The monomeric dopants would include those materials havinq the following characteristics.1. Solubility in the casting solvent.2. Solubility in the electrolyte solution. 3. No interfering electrochemical reactions.4. No interfering chemical reactions with the polymer bound electroactive species.5. They have moderate size so that leaching into the electrolyte solution may occur.These dopants can be neutral molecules or ionic salts. Typical monomeric dopants are selected from tetrabutylammonium perchlorate TBAP , tetrahexylammonium perchlorate THAP ,Variamine Blue B, and tetracylanoquinodiamethane TCNQ In practice the monomeric dopant is added to a polymer solution and the solution is spin coated on a viewing substrate. Typical doping levels which produce the desired characteristics are from about 5 to about 50 by weight dopant polymer .The polyelectrolyte dopants would include those materials having the following characteristics 1. Solubility in the casting solvent.2. No interfering electrochemical reaction.3. No interfering chemical reactions with the polymer bound electroactive species.These dopants can be incorporated into the spinning solution, as described above for the monomeric dopants, or they can be formed in situ in the film by chemical reaction, in which case the following characteristic must also be exhibited 4. The polymer bound electroactive species must be stable under the reaction conditions for formation of the polymer bound ionic dopant.Polyelectrolytes found suitable for the invention include EMI14.1 Polyvinylbenzyl ethyl phenyl ammonium perchlorateEMI14.2 Polyvinylbenzyl diethyl phenyl ammonium tetrafluoroborateSuitable chemical reactions for in situ formation of these polyelectrolyte dopants include Protonation of tertiary amine groups by acids including 11C104 Alkylation of tertiary amine groups b reagents including Et30BP4 The coated substrate or working electrode is placed in a cell having reference and counter electrodes. It is filled with an electrolyte of the type listed above. A voltage of about 1 2 volts from dc power source is applied across the electrodes causing a color change in the polymer films.The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent fro the following more particular description of preferred embodiments of the invention. EXAMPLESThe following examples are given solely for purposes of illustrations and are not to be considered limitations on the inventions, many variations of which are possible without departing from the spirit or scope thereof. Example 1A cell having working reference and counter electrodes therein was filled with a solution of tetraethyl ammonium 0.1M perchlorate in acetonitrile as the electrolyte. The working electrode was coated with a 0.5 micron thick film of a polyvinylbenzlphenoxytetrathiafulvalene copolymer bonded thereto. The coating solution was comprised of the copolymer in tetrahydrofuran to which was added TBAP in the amount of 50e by weight of the polymeric material. A green coloration of the film was produced by potentiostatically applying a voltage of 0.65V vs. SCE to the working electrode. FIG. 1 compares the current transients accompanying this potential pulse for the doped film solid line and a film prepared without the dopant dotted line . The effect of doping on the write pulse is substantial, i.e. the time required for the writing process is decreased by a factor of more than ten.The green coloration was also produced by applying a constant current of 1 mA across the cell.The dotted line in FIG. 2 depicts the potential transient accompanying a constant current write pulse of lmA in the film prepared without theTBAP dopant. The sharp increase in voltage corresponds to a failure mode of the film. It was demonstrated that within a very few pulse cycles the film activity was lost. By contrast the potential in the TBAP doped film, represented by the solid line, is well behaved throughout the entire current pulse and the failure mode is avoided. Example 2A cell as in Example 1 was prepared except the working electrode was coated from a solution of polyvinyl benzyl phenoxy tetrathiafulvalene in tetrahydrofuran to which was added about 30 by weight of TCNQ. The cell was operated in the same manner as in Example 1. The results obtained were similar to those disclosed in Example 1. Example 3A cell as in Example 1 was prepared except that the working electrode was coated from a solution of polyvinyl benzyl phenoxy tetrathiafulvalene in tetrahydrofuran to which was added about 50 by weight of variamine Blue B. The cell was operated in the same manner as in Example 1. The results obtained were similar to those disclosed in Example 1. Example 4A cell as in Example 1 and the same procedure was used except that a coating solution containingEMI17.1 polyvinylbenzyl 2 tricyano vinyl,5 dimethyl amino phenyl ether to which was added 50 by weight TBAP was used.Similar results were obtained. Example 5A cell as in Example 1 and the same procedure was used except that the working electrode was coated using a solution containing 2 parts by weight of polyvinylbenzyl ethylphenylamine .The film was then treated with a solution of triethyloxionium fluoroborate in ether for five minutes to quarternize the amine groups. Similar results were obtained with this in situ produced polyelectrolyte doped film as in the Examples above.
