## Description
The present invention relates to a curable epoxy resin composition. More particularly, the invention relates to a one pack, thermosetting epoxy resin composition having an excellent storage stability and curable at a relatively low temperature is a short time. The curable epoxy resin composition contains a curing agent highly compatible with an ordinary epoxy resin to form a cured product having excellent mechanical strength, adhesiveness and water resistance. The development of a latent curing epoxy resin composition of the one pack type usable as an adhesive for structural materials has been demanded. In processes proposed heretofore, an imidazole compound or its salt with an acid is used as a curing agent. However, conventional curing epoxy resin compositions of the one pack type have problems in that heating at a high temperature for a long time is required and that the storage stability thereof is yet unsatisfactory, since the curing reaction proceeds at room temperature due to their insufficient latentness even though they can be cured at a relatively low temperature. The shelf life of them is usually only about 10 to 20 days at room temperature. Under these circumstances, an improvement has been demanded. Another defect is that when it is cured at a relatively low temperature in a short time, the cured product has a quite low peeling strength. To overcome these defects, a curing agent comprising a dialkylamine to which an epoxy resin is added is disclosed in the specifications of Japanese Patent Laid Open Nos. 155222 1981 and 100127 1982 and a curing agent comprising an amino alcohol or aminophenol to which an epoxy resin is added is disclosed in the specification of Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 53526 1984. However, when the above mentioned curing agents are used, the compatibility thereof with the epoxy resin is poor and it is difficult to control the balance among heat resistance, flexibility and adhesiveness of the obtained cured product, since no active hydrogen of the amino group is contained in the molecule. It is the object of the present invention to provide a curable epoxy resin composition of the one pack type containing a curing agent having a high compatibility with the epoxy resin and capable of curing at a relatively low temperature in a short time to form a cured product having excellent mechanical strength, particularly adhesiveness, heat resistance, flexibility and storage stability, wherein the control of the balance among these properties is easy.

The reaction of the amine epoxy adduct a with the phenolic resin or polyhydric phenol b is carried out at a temperature of 80 to 200 C for 1 to 5 h and the obtained reaction product has a softening point of preferably 60 to 120 C.
