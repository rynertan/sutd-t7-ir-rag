# IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO THE TREATMENT OF MEAT

## Abstract
The present specification discloses a method and appar atus for treating meat, especially bacon pieces. Convention ally bacon pieces are individually frozen and then compress ed, before slicing. This produces waste from the ends of the bacon pieces and also requires an amount of handling which reduces the temperature of the bacon pieces and thus impairs slicing unless the bacon piece is frozen to a great extent. However, such deep freezing impairs the quality of the bacon. The present invention provides a method and apparatus wherein, if used to handle bacon, the bacon pieces are first compressed in a press 5 to attain a desired transverse cross section. Then the compressed bacon pieces are passed through an elongate duct 1 which is refrigerated so that the bacon pieces are chilled or frozen to a limited extent before passing to the slicer 6 . Thus handling is reduced and also by chilling and squaring off the ends of the bacon pieces, and freezing adjacent bacon pieces together, wastage during slicing is obviated.
