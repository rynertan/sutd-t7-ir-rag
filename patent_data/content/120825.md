## Abstract
Apparatus for taking samples of cells of small tumours with the aid of fine needle puncturing techniques. The apparatus includes a hand grip 1 having removably con nected thereto a syringe provided with a thin cannula 2 . The cannula 2 is connected, via a coupling 18 , to a motor 12, 13, 15, 16 which can be energized for driving the cannula 2 in an oscillating, reciprocatory movement. The cannula 2 is con nected to a container 4 having arranged for movement therein a suction plunger 5 , which is arranged to create a vacuum in the cannula 2 , for drawing a cell sample thereinto.
