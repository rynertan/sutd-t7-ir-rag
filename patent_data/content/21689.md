# Paper collating device for use with a photocopier.

## Abstract
A photocopier collator 10 has a movable paper chute 14 disposed between the discharge slot of a photocopy machine and the entry point of a plurality of bins mounted adjacent thereto. The movable paper chute 14 directs them successively into different ones of the bins 15 19 . The chute is successively diverted to each of the predetermined number of bins by means of a pulse from the photocopy machine. The pulse actuates a solenoid 41 which controls a cam latch 34 thereby releasing a follower 14A which is attached to the movable paper chute 14 . Actuation of the solenoid 31 successively lowers the paper chute 14 to divert successive sheets of photocopies to each of the predetermined number of bins 15 19 . After the pulse from the photocopy machine has actuated the solenoid 31 , the latch 34 is pulled away from the solenoid by means of a spring 38 , a second solenoid 41 returns the movable paper chute to repeat the cycle.
