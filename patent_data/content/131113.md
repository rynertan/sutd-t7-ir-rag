# POLYCAPROLACTAM BASED POLYMER COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
New polycaprolactam based polymer compositions have been prepared by polymerising caprolactam in the presence of a quantity of nitrile rubber not exceeding 25 by weight of the total mixture weight, and preferably 5 20 by weight. The polymerisation is conducted in the presence of anionic initiators and anionic polymerisation activators. The new compositions obtained are extremely uniform, and have physical and elasticity characteristics which sub stantially coincide with nylon 6. There resistance to impact and deformation is however substantially higher.
