# LOW TEMPERATURE STABLE POLYMETHYLENE POLYPHENYLENE POLYISOCYANATES

## Abstract
Low temperature stable polymethylene polyphenylene polyisocyanates are composed of crude poymethylene poly phenylene polyisocyanate containing from about 50 to about 80 percent by weight 2 ring diphenylmethane diisocyanate wherein from about 65 to about 93 weight percent of the 2 ring diisocyanate is 4,4 and from about 7 to about 35 weight percent is 2,4 and furthermore the composition con tains from about 1 to about 5 weight percent carbodiimide uretonimine structure. The polyisocyanates are useful in preparing polyurethane foams.
