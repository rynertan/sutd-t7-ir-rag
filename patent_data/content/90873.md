## Description
SLIDE FASTENER The present invention pertains generally to slide fasteners and more particularly to the type of slide fastener commonly known as a zipper which has opposed strings or rows of interlocking elements or zipper teeth which are brought into interlocking engagelnent by the movement of a slider in one direction along the rows and disengaged or unfastened by movement of the slider in the opposite direction. The present invention addresses the problem of reducing the difficulty involved with the initial engagement of the ends of a separable zipper on a jacket or similar garment. It will be appreciated, however, that the solution provided by the present invention has useful application to the entire field of slide fasteners. The present invention permits the ends of a separable zipper to be interconnected and the zipper to be fastened with a minimum of care and dexterity. In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, a device for connecting the ends of a separable zipper includes a slider having first and second ports separated by a center post at the front of the slider, the ports being adapted to receive first and second opposed rows of zipper teeth and guide the zipper teeth into a common passiigeWy rearward from the center post within which the teeth in the opposed rows are progressively forced into interlocking engagement as the slider is pulled forward, a base terminal disposed at the rearward end of the first row of teeth and a receiving terminal disposed at the rearward end of the second row of teeth, the base terminal being adapted to carry the slider when the rows are fully disengaged and the terminals are seperated and there being on the bottom of the slider means for guiding the slider, when in its rearmost position on the base terminal, into a cooperating aperture in the receiving terminal by movement in a direction generally perpendicular to the plane through which the zipper rows move when passing through the slider.In accordance with a second aspect of the invention, a device for connecting the ends of a separable zipper having first and second opposed rows of zipper teeth includes a leading slider and a trailing slider adapted to progressively engage the zipper rows by the forward movement of the leading slider and progressively disengage the zipper rows by the forward movement of the trailing slider following in the path of the leading slider, a base terminal disposed at the rearward end of the first row of teeth and a receiving terminal disposed at the rearward end of the second row of teeth, the base terminal being adapted to carry the sliders when the rows of teeth are fully disengaged and the terminals are separated and there teing on the bottom of at least one of the sliders a disc for guiding the sliders, when in their rearmost position on the base terminal, into a cooperating aperture in the receiving terminal by movement in a direction generally perpendicular to the plane through which the zipper rows move when passing through the sliders.Two examples of devices in accordance with the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of a first embodiment of the present invention showing first and second zipper terminals aligned just prior to engagement, the first terminal or base terminal carrying a slider adapted to fasten conventional rows of zipper teeth which are shown in phantom the second terminal or receiving terminal being adapted to engage the slider and first terminal in the indicated manner FlGURE 2 is a perspective view showing the terminals interlocked in operative engagement and the slider moved slightly forward up the rows of zipper teeth FIGURE 3 is a perspective view of the specially adapted slider shown separately FIGURE 4 is a vertial cross section of the slider and a rearward portion of the base terminal taken along the line 4 4 of FIGURE 1 in the direction indicated FIGURE 5 is a top plan view of a receiving terminal in accordance with a second embodiment of the invention FIGURE 6 is a top plan view of a base terminal in accordance with the second embodiinent FIGURE 7 is a perspective view from below and slighty rearward of the terminals of FIGURES 5 and 6, including first and second back to back sliders in their rearmost position on the base terminal, the sliders and terminals being aligned just prior to being brought into operative engagement in the indicated manner FIGURE 8 is a perspective view of the sliders and terminals oriented in the same relative position as in FIGURE 7 but looking from an overhead forward point of view from which the right sides of the sliders are visible FIGURE 9 is a perspective view of the sliders and terminals interlocked in operative engagement looking from an overhead forward point of view from which the left sides of the sliders are visible FIGURE 10 is a perspective view from essentially the same point of view as FIGURE 9 but with the first slider pulled forward to fasten the rearmost ends of the zipper rows and FIGURE 11 is a perspective view from a slightly higher elevation thanFIGURE 10 but with the second slider pulled forward to disengage the terminals and the rearmost zipper teeth. Referring to FIGURES 1 4, a device for connecting the ends of a separable zipper is illustrated and designated generally by reference 10. With particular reference to FiGURE 2, the zipper includes interlocking elements or teeth arranged in adjacent opposing rows 12 and 14 in a conventional manner along the respective edges of flexible supporting sheets or stringers 16 and 18. The device 10 includes a first terminal or slider base terminal 20 and a second terminal or receiving terminal 22. As see in FIGURE 1, the slider base terminal 20 is adapted to carry a slider 24, which is illustrated separately in FIGURE 3. The slider 24 is manually operable for fastening the zipper rows 12 and 14 by means of a handle 26 pivotally mounted atop the slider 24. Pulling the slider 24 forward as indicated by the arrow 27 in FIGURE 2 engages the zipper rows 12 and 14 which can then be disengaged by pulling the slider 24 in the opposite or rearward direction. In as much as the zipper rows 12 and 14 and supporting stringers 16 and 18 are essentially conventional, they have merely been schematically depicted in phantom in FIGURE 1 for ease of illustration. ln accordance with a unique feature of the present invention, a disc 28 is affixed to the bottom of the slider 24 as seen best in FIGURE 3. The purpose and function of the disc 28 will be described in detail below. More conventional portions of the slider 24 include top and bottom plates 30 and 32 held in spaced apart parallel planes by a center post 34. The top plate 30 is provided with downwardly extending rims 36 and the bottom plate 32 is provided with upwardly extending rims 38. Adjacent opposing pairs of such rims 36 and 3B define conventional side slots through which the stringers 16 and 18 pass as the slider 24 travels along the zipper rows 12 and 14. As the slider 24 moves forward, the teeth in the opposed rows 12 and 14 enter respective slider ports 40 and 42 defined between the center post 34 and the respective front edges of the rims 36 and 38.As the zipper rows 12 and 14 pass through the slider 24, the individual teeth are progressively brought into interlocking engagement within the slider 24 in the conventional manner. Since the stringers 16 and 18 are ordinarily flexible, the full length of each stringer will not necessarily lie in a single plane. However, portions of the stringers 16 and 18 will lie in what will be referred to herein as the 11slider working plane as they pass through the slider 24. It will be appreciated that the slider working plane is parallel to and lies intermediate the planes defined by the top and bottom plates 30 and 32 of the slider 24. The terminals 20 and 22 are securely fastened to the respective zipper rows 12 and 14 by attaching the stringers 16 and 18 to respective wing plates 44 and 46 on each terminal 20 and 22 . The wings 44 and 46 lie in the same planes as their respective stringers 12 and 14 and become coplanar in the slider working plane whenever the terminals 20 and 22 are operativly engaged as seen in FIGURE 2. The wings 44 and 46 are sufficiently thin that they can pass through the side slots of the slider 24, which can therefore be readily moved from the position shown in FIGURE 2 to its rearmost position within the receiving terminal 22. The receiving terminal 22 includes a floor plate 48 lying in a plane below and parallel to the wing 46, as seen best in the view of FIGURE 1. A sidewall 50 extends upward from the periphery of the floor 48 to support the wing 46. The sidewall 50 includes a rearward portion 52 which is curved through an are of 180 degrees so that the disc 28 can move forward out of the receiving terminal 22 as the slider 24 is pulled forward to fasten the zipper rows 12 and 14. The wing 46 includes a curved edge 54 which lies in the same circular arc defined by the interior surface of the curved rearward portion 52 of the sidewall 50.The curved edge 54 and the upper interior edge of the wall portion 52 define an aperture 56 extending through an arc of about 270 degrees for receiving the disc 28 as tho slider 24 is brought down into the terminal 22 from the position illustrated inFIGURE 1. The disc 28 includes a chamfered lower edge 58 adapted to facilitate guiding the disc 28 into the receiving aperture 56. In order to fasten the zipper, the terminals 20 and 22 must first be brought into interlocking engagement as depicted in FIGURE 2 from a separated position as depicted in FIGURE 1. Briefly, with the slider 24 in its rearmost position on the slider base terminal 20 the assembly of the slider 24 and terminal 20 is first oriented relative to the receiving terminal 22 substantially as shown inFIGURE 1 and then brought down into the terminal 22 until a locking element 60 extending rearward from the slider base terminal 20 meets a ramp 62 formed by an upper edge of the sidewall 50.While forcing the terminals 20 and 22 together, the assembly of the slider 24 and its base terminal 20 is then rotated relative to the receiving terminal 22 in the direction indicated by the curved arrow in FIGURE 1 until the locking element 60 moves into a notch 64 formed within the sidewall 50 at the lower rearward end of the ramp 62. At this stage, the wings 44 and 46 will have become essentially coplanar and the bottom surface of the disc 28 will abut the top surface of the floor 48. Once the terminals 20 and 22 have been operatively engaged in the foregoing manner, the slider 24 can be pulled forward up the zipper rows 12 and 14 to progressively fasten the teeth as depicted in FIGURE 2.Guide segments 66 and 68 are formed on the forward mutually adjacent portions of the wings 44 and 46 to assist the initial forward movement of the slider 24 in the proper direction Pulling the slider 24 forward from its rearmost position to fasten the zipper rows 12 and 14 will not cause the slider base terminal 20 to move forward relative to the receiviun Aa 22 since the locking element 60 is provided with flanged portions 70 which abut the outer vertical surface of the sidewall 50 as depicted in FIGURE 2. It will be appreciated that the guide segments 66 and 68 will be separated transversely by a slight amount as the slider 24 begins its forward movement from its rearmost position within the terminal 22 because the center post 34 must pass between the guide segments 66 and 68. The degree of separation of the guide segments 66 and 68 during such initial forward movement of the slider 24 will be limited by the side rims 36 and 38 of the slider 24 engaging cooperating edges of the guide segments 66 and 68. As the center post 34 of the slider 24 passes beyond the guide segments 66 and 68, they will be forced together within the interior passageway of the slider 24 by the side rims 36 and 38 which taper inward from front to back as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.Any slight relative rotation of the terminals 20 and 22 during such initial forward movement of the slider 24 will not cause the locking element 60 to move entirely out of the notch 64 since the notch 64 is made long enough to compensate for such slight rotation. Once the slider 24 has been pulled forward to at least partially fasten the zipper rows 12 and 14, the terminals 20 and 22 will be interlocked in the position shown in FIGURE 2. Relative movement of the terminals 20 and 22 in the axial direction i.e., the direction perpendicular to the floor 48 is prevented at the rear by the locking element 60 lodged within the notch 64 and at the front by a tongue 72 FIGURE 1 extending transversely from the guide segment 66 into a groove 74 in the guide segment 68. Pulling apart the terminals 20 and 22 in the transverse direction, as indicated by the arrows 75 in FIGURE 2, is prevented at the rear once again by the locking element 60 nested within the notch 64 at the front by the interlocking effect of at least the rearmost teeth 12a and 14a of the zipper rows 12 and 14. Pushing the terminals 20 and 22 together in the transverse direction to attempt to withdraw the locking element 60 from the notch 64 is prevented by a downwardly extending post 76 shown in dotted outline which is secured to the underside of the wing 44 and abuts the outer edge of the sidewall 50 when the terminals 20 and 22 are interlocked as shown in Figure 2.Separation of the terminals 20 and 22 proceeds as follows. The slider is pulled rearward from a position such as that depicted inFigure 2 until the disc enters the terminal 22 and reaches its rear most position therein. During this process, the center post 34 of the slider 24 passes between and separates the guide segments 66 and 68, which causes a slight initial rotation of the terminals 20 and 22.Since the zipper rows 12 and 14 are no longer interlocked, the terminals 20 and 22 are free to continue their rotation relative to each other until the locking element 60 is withdrawn from the notch 64. During such rotation, the post 76 slides rearward along the outer surface of the of the sidewall 50. Once the locking cement 60 has been withdrawn from the notch 64, the terminals 20 and 22 can be separated by pulling axially upward on the wing 44 and axially downward on the wing 46 to return the terminals 20 and 22 to a separated position such as depicted in Figure 1.Although the terminals 20 and 22 can thus be separated, rearward movement of the slider 24 off its base terminal 20 is prevented by an end stop 78 extending upwardly from the terminal 20 to contact a rearward wall portion 80 of the slider 24, as seen in the sectional view of Figure 4.As an optional desirable feature of the inventive device 10, a mechanism which tends to hold the slider 24 in its rearmost position on the slider base terminal 20 to facilitate handling the slider 24 and the terminal 20 together as a unit will now be described with reference to Figure 4.Housed within the thickened rearward portion of the terminal 20 is a pointed pin 82 which is biased by a spring 84 to extend the pin 82 by a predetermined amount out from the bottom of the terminal 20 . When the slider 24 is in its rearmost position on the terminal 20 as depicted inFigure 4, the pointed tip of pin 82 will lodge in an indentation 86 in the top surface of the bottom slider plate 32, thereby tending to keep the the slider 24 in the position shown. However, when it is desired to move the slider 24 forward, the handle 26 can be urged forward without great effort to cause the pin 82 to lift up as the indentation 86 moves forward beyond the pin 82. The pin 82 will snap back into its fully extended position when the rearward edge of the bottom slider plate 32 passes beyond the pin 82.It will be appreciated that the foregoing sequence of events occurs in reverse order when the slider 24 is returned to its rearmost position. It will be appreciated from the foregoing description that the device 10 enables the connection of the ends of a seperable zipper with relative ease when compared to prior art devices employing the conventional pin and socket terminals. The principle advantage of the present invention over such prior art devices is the relatively large size of the disc 28 and its cooperating receiving aperture 56 which permit the terminals 20 and 22 to be brought together conveniently in the direction perpendicular to the slider working.plane and then interlocked by a slight rotational movement. It has been found that such an arrangement requires less dexterity to operate than the conventional pin andsocket terminal arrangement. Another advantage which is inherent in the design of the device 10 when employed with the zipper on a jacket or similar item of apparel is that the device 10 can readily be adapted to permit its engagement and the fastening of the zipper rows 12 and 14 with one hand by the wearer. This is accomplished by securing gripper strips not shown , such as the material sold under the trademarkVelcro, to the back outer surface not visible in the illustrated views of the floor plate 48 and on a front surface of a belt buckle not shown or the like of the wearer. The wearer will then be able to secure the receiving terminal 22 to the belt buckle. Next, the slider disc 28 can be inserted into the aperture 56 and slider 24 and terminal 20 rotated to interlock the element 60 in the notch 64.Finally, the wearer can pull the slider 24 forward using the handle 26 to fasten the zipper rows 12 and 14. It will be appreciated that each of the foregoing steps can be performed using only one hand. Another embodiment of my invention will now be described with reference to FIGURES 5 11. A zipper terminal device of my invention is designated generally by reference numeral 110 in FIGURES 7 11. The device 110 is designed to facilitate connecting the ends of the type of separable zipper sometimes referred to in the art as a two way sUde fastener which employs a first slider for fastening the zipper rows and a second slider for at least partially unfastening the zipper rows to permit the zipper to be open at both ends and fastened in the middle. The device 110 includes a slider base terminal 120, which is separately illustrated in FIGURE 6, and a receiving terminal 122, which is separately illustrated in FIGURE 5. The terminals 120 and 122 are securely fastened at the rearmost ends of zipper rows 112 and 114 which are schematically depicted in phantom along with their supporting stringers 116 and 118 in FIGURES 5 and 6. The zipper rows 112 and 114 and stringers 116 and 118 are not shown in FIGURES 7 9 for ease and clarity of illustration. As seen best in FIGURE 8, the slider base terminal 120 is adapted to carry two back to back sliders consisting of a leading slider 124a and a trailing slider 124b. The sliders 124a and 124b are manually operable by means of pivotally mounted handles 126a and 126b, respectively. As seen in FIGURE 7, a disc 128 is disposed in overlapping relationship on the bottom surfaces of the sliders 124a and 124b. The dise 128 comprises a first semicircular portion 128a affixed to the bottom of the leading slider 124a and a second semicircular portion 128b affixed to the bottom of the trailing slider 124b. When the sliders 124a and 124b are in their rearmost abutting positions on the base terminal 120 as seen in FIGURE 7, the disc halves 128a and 128b are kept in longitudinal alignment by a tongue and groove arrangement seen in dotted outline and designated by reference numeral 129. Referring to FIGURES 8 and 9, the sliders 124a and 124b include top and bottom plates with adjoining side rims, the plates being interconnected by respective center posts 134a and 134b, all of which are essentially conventional in construction like their corresponding parts in the singleslider embodiment 10 previously described with reference to FIGURES 1 4. The leading slider 124a tus right and left slider ports l40a and 142a on opposite sides of the center post 134a, as seen best in FIGURE 8. Likewise, the trailing slider 124b has right and left slider ports 140b and 142b on opposite sides of the center post 134b, as seen best inFIGURE 7. With reference again to FIGURES 5 and 6, the terminals 120 and 122 are securely fastened to their respective zipper rows 112 and 114 by attaehing the stringers 116 and 118 to respective wing plates 144 and 146 in a suitable manner. The wings 144 and 146 lie in the same planes as their respective stringers 112 and 114 and become coplanar in the slider working plane whenever the terminals 120 and 122 are operatively engaged, such as in FIGURE 9. Referring again to FIGURE 8, the receiving terminal 122 includes a floor 148 lying in a plane below and parallel to the wing 146, the floor 148 and wing 146 being interconnected by one side of a generally Urhaped sidewall 150. The sidewall 150 includes a semicircular rearward portion 152 adapted to receive the disc 128 during initial engagement of the terminals 120 and 122. The forward portions of the sidewalls 150 are provided with shelves 153a and 153b which extend transversely inward. The shelves 153a and ì53b terminate rearwardly in curved edges 154a and 154b, respectively, and together with the curved wall portion 152 provide an arced receiving aperture 156 subtending an angle somewhat in excess of 180 degrees. The disc 128 includes a chamfered lower edge 158 FIGURE 7 adapted to facilitate guiding the disc 128 into the receiving aperture 156 as the assembly of the sliders 124a and 124b and their base terminal 120 are brought down into engagement with the terminal 122 from the position shown in FIGURE 8. The disc half 128b on the trailing slider 124b includes a locking element 160 in the form of a flat tongue like flange protruding transversely from the top left surface of the disc half 128b, as shown in FIGURE 8 and seen in dotted outline in FIGURE 11. When the terminals are initially engaged, the locking element 160 comes to rest on a shoulder 162, which is visible in FIGURE 8. The shoulder 162 extends rearward into a notch 164 formed within the sidewall 150 under an overhanging shelf 165.The locking element 160 is adapted to lodge within the notch 164 to assist in interlocking the terminals 120 and 122, as will be described more fully below. Referring briefly again to FIGURE 6, the slider base terminal 120 is provided with an elongated guide segment 166 which curves slightly to the right away from the rearward projection of the zipper row 112. When the sliders 124a and 124b are in their rear most position on the base terminal 120, the elongated guide segment 166 extends through the right side of each slider as seen best in FIGURE 7. Referring briefly again to FIGURE 5, the receiving terminal 122 includes a guide segement 168 cantilevered inward from the forward portion of the wing plate 146. The guide segment 168 is adapted to guide the center post 134a into operative proximity with the rearmost end of the zipper row 114 as will be appreciated from the view of FIGURE 9. As seen in FIGURES 8 and 9, the guide segment 166 includes a tongue 172 adapted to mate with a groove 174 in the guide segment 168. In order to keep the sliders 124a and 124b on the slider base terminal 120 when the terminals 120 and 122 are separated, the terminal 122 is provided with an end stop 178, as shown in FlGURE 6. The end stop 178 extends above the adjacent top surface of the guide segment 166 so that the end stop 178 will lodge within a recessed surface 180 under the top plate of the slider 124b as seen in FIGURE 7, thereby preventing rearward movement of the slider 124b from the position shown in FIGURE 7. Referring again to FIGURES 7 and 8, the slider base terminal 120 is provided with a circular plate 190 which is carried below the wing 144 by means of a downwardly extending rod 192. The plate 190 is adapted to lodge partially within a notch 194 in an upper surface portion of the disc half 128b when the slider 124b is in its rearmost postion on the terminal 120 as seen in FIGURE 7. The plate 190 extends outward from the disc half 128b so that it will come to rest on a recessed surface 196 in the curved rearward portion 152 of the sidewall 150 as depicted inFIGURE 8. The terminal 122 is provided with a slot 198 and an outlet 200 adapted to permit the rod 192 and plate 190 to pass laterally out the sidewall 150 in order to separate the terminals 120 and 122 as will be described more fully below with reference to FIGURE 11. The operation of the device 110 will now be described. With the sliders 124a and 124b in their rearmost positions on the slider base terminal 120 and the terminal 120 oriented at a slight angle relative to the receiving terminal 122 as shown in FIGURES 7 and 8, the terminals 120 and 122 are operatively engaged by bringing them together in the axial direction i.e., the direction perpendicular to the floor 148 so that the disc 128 nests down within the receiving aperture 156.The slider base terminal 120 is then rotated relative to the receiving terminal 122 in the direction indicated by the arrow in FIGURE 8 in order to bring the guide segment 168 into alignment in front of the left slider port 142a as depicted inFIGURE 9. Once rotated into the position seen in FIGURE 9, the locking element 160 moves into the notch 164, which is visible in FIGURE 8, in order to prevent axial movement of the terminals 120 and 122 relative to each other. In order to further assist in axially interlocking the terminals 120 and 122, it will be appreciate from the view in FIGURE 8 that the outer edge of the circular plate 190 will have moved from its initial resting position on the recessed surface 196 under the rearward portions of the shelf 153b stradled by the slot 198. Once the terminals 120 and 122 have become operatively engaged and interlocked in the foregoing manner, the leading slider 124a can be pulled up the zipper rows 112 and 114 to progressively fasten the teeth as depicted in FIGURE 10. As long as the trailing slider 124b is left in its rearmost position, the terminals 120 and 122 will remain interlocked against separation. Relative movement in the axial direction is prevented at the rear by the floor 148 abutting the bottom of the disc half 128b, the locking element 160 lodged under the shelf 165, and the circular plate 190 lodged under the rearward portions of the shelf 153b. Relative movement of the terminals 120 and 122 in the axial direction is prevented at the front by the interlocked tongue 172 and groove 174, which are seen separated in FIGURE 9.Relative movement of the terminals 120 and 122 in the transverse directions is prevented by the disc half 128b nested rearwardly within the sidewall 150, the interlocking effect of the rear most zipper teeth 112a and 114a, and the side rims of the slider 124b grasping the adjacent edges of the elongated guide segment 166.During the forward movement of the sliders 124a and 124b, the shelves 153a and 153b and the adjacent portions of the wall 150 and floor 148 below the shelves 153a and 153b serve as guide chutes for the edges of the disc halves 128a and 128b which extend beyond the sides of their respective sliders 124a and 124b, thereby keeping the sliders 124a and 124b in proper alignment for engaging the rear most ends of the zipper rows 112 and 114. Referring to FIGURE 11, it will be appreciated that the rearward ends of the zipper rows 112 and 114 can be separated by pulling the trailing slider 124b forward as far as desired up to the point where It once again abuts the leading slider 124a. Although the sliders 124a and 124b are shown relatively close to the terminals 120 and 122 for ease of illustration, it will be appreciated that the leading slider 124a can be pulled any desired distance up the zipper rows 112 and 114 up to the opposite end not shown and that the trailing slider 124b can be positioned at any point between its rear most position as seen in FIGURE 10 and the leading slider 124a. With reference to FlGURES 10 and 11, the separation of the terminals 120 and 122 is achieved as follows. As the trailing slider 124b is pulled forward from its rearmost position as seen in FIGURE 10, the center post 134b visible more clearly in FIGURE 7 progressively forces the elongated guide segment 166 to the right by bearing against a curved inner face 202 extending along the length of the guide segment 166. The initial forward movement of the slider 124b forces the rod 192 out through the slot 198 since the rod 192 is carried on the terminal 120 in fixed relationship to the guide segment 166. As the slider 124b continues its forward movement, the tongue 172 at the forward end of the guide segment 166 pulls free from its mating groove 174 in the guide segment 168.As the slider 124b exits from terminal 122, the center post 134b begins to progressively disengage the individual zipper teeth in the rows 112 and 114. In the view of FIGURE 11, the slider 124b is shown after having just passed beyond the rearmost zipper teeth 112a and 114a. It will be appreciated from FIGURE 11 that the terminals 120 and 122 can be brought back into interlocking relationship to close the rearward ends of the zipper rows 112 and 114 by merely pulling the trailing slider 124b back into its rear most position within the receiving terminal 122. In particular, as the center post 134b of the slider 124b nears the guide segments 166 and 168, the fastening action of the slider 124b working on the zipper rows 112 and 114 pulls the guide segments 166 and 168 into proper position for passing into the respective slider ports 140b and 142b visible in FIGURE 7 . As the slider 124b is pulled partially into the receiving terminal 122, the guide segments 166 and 168 begin to move through the slider 124b, thereby causing the base terminal 120 to begin to swing toward the receiving terminal 122.By the time the guide segment 168 passes out the forward end of the slider 124b, the disc half 128b will have moved between the forward ends of the U shaped sidewall 150 and under the shelves 153a and 153b, thus assuring that the slider 124b will be guided properly back into its rearmost position in terminal 122. As the slider 124b approaches its rearmost position, the rod 192 is pulled back through the slot 198 and finally cornes to rest in the notch 194 in the disc half 128b, as previously described with reference to FIGURE 7. It will of course be appreciated that the leading slider 124a can then be moved rearward to unfasten the zipper rows 112 and 114 and then be pulled into abutting relationship with the trailing slider 124b to return to the position shown in FIGURE 9.Disconnecting the terminals 120 and 122 is then easily achieved by merely rotating the terminals in the direction opposite from the arrow shown in FIGURE 8 until the locking element 160 is withdrawn from the notch 164, whereupon pulling upward on the wing 144 and downward on the wing 146 will achieve separation. Those skilled in the art will appreciate from the foregoing description that the device 110 enables the connection of the ends of the a two way slide fastener with relative ease when compared to prior art devices employing the conventional pin and socket terminals. One merely brings the disc 128 down into the receiving aperture 156 and rotates the terminals 120 and 122 slightly as previously described in order to bring the terminals 120 and 122 into interlocking engagement. Once the terminals 120 and 122 are thus engaged and interlocked, they cannot be separated by the mere forward movement of the leading slider 124a, which occurrence has been a problem with conventional pin and socket terminal devices. In a modification of the device 110, the disc 128 is an integral piece secured entirely to the bottom of either slider 124a or 124b and the other slideris essentially conventional in construction.
