# Soluble or dissolved tea product.

## Abstract
A modification of the method of producing a soluble or dissolved tea product as claimed in claim 8 of European Patent Application 84 305 052.7 Publication 0 133 772 A wherein tea cream is allowed to form in the tea liquor before the water sol uble caseinate is added. The latter solubilises the tea cream.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A modification of the method of claim 8 ofEuropean Patent Application 84305052.7 Publication 0133772A wherein tea cream is allowed to form in the tea liquor before the water soluble caseinate is added. 2. A method according to claim 1 wherein the caseinate is added to the tea liquor as a solution. 3. A method according to claim 1 wherein the caseinate is added to the tea liquor as a solid.

## Description
Soluble or Dissolved Tea Product This invention relates to the production of a tea product which may be either liquid or solid derived from tea liquor that is, a liquid obtained by infusing leaf tea in water . The liquid or solid product, when diluted to a normal tea strength, provides a tea beverage. In our earlier European Patent ApplicationNo. 84305052.7, Publication 0133772A, we have described and claimed how a soluble or dissolved tea product may be obtained from a tea liquor using a water soluble caseinate. The caseinate stabilises the liquor against tea cream formation and allows the liquor to be cooled to enable cold concentration processes to be employed. We have now discovered that the caseinate technique can be employed even after creaming of the tea liquor has taken place. The liquor may be cooled, say, to room temperature thus forming a heavy tea cream precipitate and a water soluble caseinate then added in solid or liquid form . Dispersion of the caseinate in the creamed tea liquor causes the latter to stabilise.The tea cream disappears to leave a clear solution. The latter may then be cold concentrated by any of the processes described in European Patent Application 84305052.7. According to the present invention we provide a method which is a modification of the method of claim 8 of European Patent Application 84305052.7 wherein tea cream is allowed to form in the tea liquor before the water soluble caseinate is added. Apart from this modification all the other processing described inEuropean Patent Application 84305052.7 may be employed. The following Example illustrates the invention. Example 706 g leaf tea a blend of fannings and dust was placed in a vessel of about 3 litres capacity, fitted with a warm water jacket. 4.5 litres of water at 900C was pumped into the vessel, allowed to stand for 5 minutes and ejected by pumping in air at 6 psi.The 2.8 litres of tea extract so obtained was cooled in a heat exchanger to 100C and then placed in a vessel with a bottom opening connected to a Lowara C70 5Centrifugal Pump. The tea creamed during the cooling stage and became a bright orange colour . The outlet to this pump was connected to an eductor made by KPXEductors, 1 Park View, Binns Lane, Holmfirth, Huddersfield. The pump was started and the eductor directed so as to recirculate the tea extract back into the vessel.Powdered sodium caseinate 120 g was fed into the solution through the throat of the eductor over a period of about 10 minutes. The caseinate dissolved and the solution remained pale brown because of airentrainment. Once the pump was switched off and the air separated out, the liquid was no longer bright orange. This showed that the creaming had been reversed even though the temperature had not risen above 200C. It was then possible to concentrate the stabilised extract by any low temperature process, such as described in European Patent Application No.84305052.7.
