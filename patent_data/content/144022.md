# Color picture tube.

## Abstract
A colour picture tube is disclosed, which comprises a phosphor screen, a shadow mask disposed near and facing the screen and having a main surface with a number of apertures, and electron guns for emitting electron beams passing through said apertures to bombard said screen and thereby selectively illuminating phosphors on the screen. The main surface of the shadow of the shadow mask 5 on the side of the electron guns is provided with a coating layer 14 consisting of a material having a thermal expansion coefficient lower than those of the material of the shadow mask 5 , and relatively low electrical conductivity, whereby doming of the shadow mask 5 and miss landing of electron beams can be suppressed.
