# Device for positioning slide fastener stringers in fastener finishing apparatus.

## Abstract
A device 10 for positioning a pair of longitudinally advancing elongate slide fastener stringers 14 comprises a pair of positioning jaws 18, 19 movable relatively to one another in a direction substantially perpendicular to the plane of each slide fastener stringer to define therebetween a guide channel 20 for the passage of the slide fastener stringer. At least one of the positioning jaws 19 includes a step 28 for engaging the leading coupling element 16a of each coupling element row 16 mounted on one longitudon al edge of a tape 15 of each respective slide fastener stringer, thereby stopping the slide fastener stringer. The positioning device having the positioning jaws is capable of accurately positioning the slide fastener stringers even when the slide fastner stringer is laterally undulated or locally swelled during advancing movement thereof.
