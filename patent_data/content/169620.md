# Apparatus for purifying water, comprising an upflow reactor with an influent distributing system to be connected to a central water supply system.

## Abstract
An apparatus comprising an upflow reactor 10 in which, while maintaining a sludge blanket, water to be purified can be contacted with one or more agents bringing the dissolved and or dispersed material into a condition in which it can be separated from the water. The influent distributing system includes a plurality of tube members assembled to form one or more strings 1 9 . The strings have outlet openings obliquely directed down wards and through which the water to be purified can be introduced into the reactor space at a plurality of spaced locations. For cleaning the ends of the strings they are provided with T pieces closed by ball valves 14 disposed outside the reactor space and closed during operation.
