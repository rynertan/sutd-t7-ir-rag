# Tone signal generation device.

## Abstract
A tone generation 10 includes a plurality of tone ge neration channels each comprising one or more operation channels OP1 OPx . One operation channel performs basic operation of a tone signal computing operation e.g., FM or AM and a tone signal is generated by using one or more operation channels for one tone generation channel. Tone generation channels in the tone generator are established according to a selected performance mode. In a first mode, the operation channels are divided into N groups and N tone generation channels are established in correspondence to the respective operation channel groups. In a second mode, the operation channels are divided into M groups and M tone generation channels are established in correspondence to the respective operation channel groups wherein N is a different number from M. Tone generation channels of the number re quired according to the selected performance mode can be established by efficiently utilizing the operation channels of a limited number.
