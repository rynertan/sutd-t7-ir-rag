# Chroma demodulator circuit for SECAM television signals.

## Abstract
A known form of SECAM subcarrier demodulator employs a multi stage limiter amplifier 15 to supply two inputs L, P to a signal multiplier 19 , one input L being supplied directly and the other input P being supplied via a phase shifter 17 which imparts a phase shift of 90 C at one of the SECAM subcarrier resting frequencies. One of the amplifier stages, preferably the final amplifier stage 15C , of the limiter amplifier 15 is provided according to the invention, such as by the provision of positive feedback via 68 , with a hysteresis characteristic ensuring development of a limiter output having a rectangular waveshape with rise and fall times of substantial constancy, independent of input signal amplitude variations. Negative DC feedback through 71 from the penultimate amplifier stage 15B to the input amplifier stage 15A of the limiter amplifier 15 can also be provided to assure desired symmetry of limiting action. Color difference signal output is obtained by low pass filtering 21 of the products of multiplication of the respective signal inputs.
