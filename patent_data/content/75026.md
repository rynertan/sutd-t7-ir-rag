The operation of the invention arranged in the manner described above will now be described. At the start of cooking, the user searches for a desired menu. Pressing the COOK key 9a on the keyboard 9 produces a character display, as shown in Fig. 5 a, on the CRT screen. This is a category list for selection of a category for cooking. The numeral 36 denotes a pointer display body which, when the function selection keys 9c and 9d called SELECT keys are pressed, is moved to a desired function cooking category position to selectively set such function. The key 9c is a reverse function selection key used to move the pointer display body 36 in the reverse direction, and the key 9d is a forward function selection key. This completes the selection of cooking category, and the next step is to select a desired one from among the menus contained in the selected category. The key 9i is a picture scroll key called STEP key and, when pressed, produces a character display, as shown in Fig. 5 b. This is a menu list contained in said selected category. In this case also, the use of the SELECT keys 9c and 9d moves the pointer display body 36 to a desired menu, whereby the latter is selected and set, and at the same time a state which makes possible the execution of the cooking sequence is established. It is now possible to start cooking by pressing the 11START11 key 9j, but a video picture demonstrating the expected result of the selected menu can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 5 c, by pressing the STEP key 9i. Subsequently, pressing the STEP key 9i produces a character display showing a list of materials needed for making the selected menu, as shown in Fig. 5 d.At this time, if the PRINT key 9Q is pressed, the list of materials depicted on the CRT 8 will be printed out by the printer 11. Further, when the STEP key 9i is pressed, information is displayed in character form teaching the cooking sequence of the selected menu, as shown in Fig. 5 e. Further, when the STEP key 9i is pressed, a video pictur showing the cooking sequence of the selected menu is sent from the VTR 7 and displayed. In this case, a concurrent explanation in sound form will facilitate the understanding. In addition, the key 9i is a forward picture scroll key for renewing the content of display on the screen in the forward direction, and the key. 9h is a reverse picture scroll key for revival in the reverse direction. Further, if the picture search key 9b called SEARCH key is pressed subsequent to the selection of the desired function cooking category by said COOK key 9a and function selection keys 9c and 9d, video pictures demonstrat ing the expected results of a plurality of menus contained in the selected cooking category will be successively shown on the CRT 8 at fixed intervals of time. When a desired display picture comes out, the user presses the picture stop key 9e called STOP key to bring it to a halt. At this time, the menu displayed on the screen is selected and set, and the cooking sequence becomes executable. After the preparatory operation for cooking described above has been completed, the START key 9j is pressed, whereby heating is started and a cooking sequence pattern 37 stored in advance is displayed, as shown in Fig. 5 g.In what seems like a bar graph shown therein, cooking time is represented in the horizontal direction and heating power in the vertical direction. If different colors are used to represent different amounts of heating power, the resulting display system is intuitive and easy to understand. Furhter, the progress of the cooking sequence can be more visually definitely indicated as by using different colors for the elapsed time portion 39 of the cooking sequence pattern 37 and the other time portion togo or by putting some mark in the portion going on. Further, it is possible to present the user accurate t me counts by providing a timer display section 38 indicat ing the cooking time in digital form. It is also possible to acoustically report the remaining time by the synthesizer 18. In the above description concerning the picture displays in Fig. 5 a through g, in the character display pictures the picture signal source is principally the semiconductor memory or floppy disk device 6 and in the video pictures the picture signal source in VTR 7. The operation of the present invention described above which is difficult to illustrate in drawing form because it is performed by the microprocessor 13 executing the control program stored in the main mem9ryunit 14, is as shown in FIgs. 6 through 9 if represented in block diagram form. Fig. 6 is a block diagram for an explanation of the operation of the picture scroll keys 9h and 9i. Each time the picture scroll keys 9h and 9i are pressed, one of the picture signal sources 41 1 through 41 N is successively addressed by address generating means 40.Picture display data from the selected picture source is transferred to the picture display means 8 and displayed on the screen. In addition, the picture signal sources 41 1 through 41 N each have a set of data, and which data should be used is determined by moving the pointer display body 36. by means of the function selection keys 9c and 9d. Fig. 7 is a block diagram for an explanation of the operat ion of the function selection keys 9c and 9d. Each time the function selection keys 9c and 9d are pressed, one of the decode output lines 44 1 through 44 N is selected by decode means 43. The selected decode output line 44 1 through 44 M displays a pointer display body 8a in the predetermined position on the picture display means 8 and the function execution means 4 5 executes the predetermined function Fig. 8 is a block diagram for an explanation of the pattern display operation for the cooking sequence. Cooking sequence data 48 stored in the semiconductor memory or floppy disk is selectively set in cooking sequence execution means 46 via the function execution means 45 by the picture scroll keys 9h and 9i and function selection keys 9c and 9d. The content of the cooking sequence is processed by the pattern generating means 47 on the basis of a predetermined picture data format to provide picture display data and written to memory 25 is displayed on the screen of the picture display means 8 by the CRT controller 24. Fig. 9 is a function block diagram for an explanation of the operation of the picture search key 9b and picture stop key 9a. Pressing the picture search key 9b causes timing means 49 to start, producing, after predetermined intervals of time, a START signal to operate motor drive means 50 and an address renewal signal to cause address counter means 51 count up. The motor drive means 50 rotates a motor 52 to drive a video tape 53. Denoted by 53 1 is a video signal memory portion and 53 2 is a picture address memory portion. The numeral 54 denotes a video signal read out head a read out video signal is pictured on the picture display means 8 through an amplifier 55. The numeral 56 denotes a picture address read out head a read out picture address is transferred to address comparison means 58 through an amplifier 57. The address comparison means 58 judges whether or not the read out picture address agrees with the address value outputted from the address counter 51, and if it agrres, outputs a STOP signal to the motor drive means to stop the rotation of the motor 52 so as to temporarily fix the picture display. After a given period of time, the timing means 49 outputs a START signal and an address renewal signal, whereupon the motor 52 is rotated again, and through the same operation aas described above a video signal having the next picture address is pictured on the picture display means 8. With such operation repeated,. the video picture is successively renewed. Further, if the picture stop key 9e is pressed, the operation of the timing means 49 is stopped, so that no START signal or address renewal signal is outputted, with the picture coming to be held still. The function menu corresponding to the display picture at this time can be identified by the address data outputted from the address counter means 51, and the setting of the cooking sequence is effected through the function execution means 45. The TV key 9i is a key for actuating the television receiver 4a to present a TV.picture on the CRT 8. The MONITOR key 9g is a key for actuating the monitor camera 5 to picture on the CRT 8 a picture input from the monitor camera. By these means, it is possible to know whether or not there is a caller at the door or what is going on in the children s room.. The DOOR key 9k is a key for opening the door 2, whose function is equivalent to the operation for orally opening the door. As for the voice input function, besides the above function of opening the door 2, it is possible to realize, e.g., the function of switching the CRT picture to one showing the expected result of the menu in Fig. 5 c in response to a voice input ROAST BEEF. As described above, the present invention is arranged so that 1 cooking data including a menu, materials and cooking sequence, 2 picture data recorded in the VTR 7 including a picture showing the expected result of the menu and a picture showing the cooking steps, 3 pictures from the TV receiver, and 4 pictures from the monitor camera can be suitably. selectively displayed, thus providing a multipurpose multifunction cooking oven control device. Further, it is possible to obtain a hard copy of the list of materials depicted on the CRT screen from the printer 11 by pressing the PRINT key 9Q or to report the necessary information in sound form to the user by means of the synthesizer 18. The door 2 can be opened by a voice input from the voice input device microphone 12 or the switching of the CRT picture can be easily realized, so that an improved operability cooking oven control device can be provided. Further, one of the plurality of function displayed on the picture display means 8 such as CRT 8 can be selected by the function keys 9c and 9d called FUNCTION keys, and the various items of cooking information on the selected function can be successively displayed on the picture display means 8 for the user by the picture scroll keys 9h and 9i called STEP keys. Further, the cooking sequence is changed into a pattern form for intuitive representation of the progress of cooking, and the cooking time is represented in digital form, so that the accurate cooking time and progress can be reported to the user. Further, a search for a function menu can be made by using the picture search key 9b called SEARCH key while viewing the video picture screen, and when a desired function menu comes out, it can be selected and set by pressing the picture stop key 9e, so that the cooking sequence can be automatically set.INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY As has been described so far, the present invention consists in providing a cooking appliance such as a microwave oven with a display device, and picturing cooking means on said display device, thereby allowing the operator to do the cooking smoothly while watching the pictures. Further, it is also possible to control the cooking appliance by the voice input means, and besides being used for picturing the cooking means, the display device can be used to project pictures from the monitor camera and video playback device thusr it is utilizable for many purposes.
