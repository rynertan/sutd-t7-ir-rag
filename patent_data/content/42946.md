# HOLOGRAPHIC SCANNER FOR GENERATING SCAN PATTERNS AND ITS APPLICATION TO THE SENSING OF BAR CODE LABELS

## Abstract
The holographic scanner includes a rotating glass disk 20 having an annular track of sectorial holographic diffrac tion gratings or holofacets 22 for deflecting an impinging laser 24 beam along arcuate scan lines. The beam which sweeps along these scan lines is redirected by beam folding mirrors 30 , to create specific scan patterns focused in predetermined regions 36,38 adjacent a scanner window 32 . Similar or dissimilar scan patterns can be generated depending upon the characteristics of the holofacets 22 and the placement of the beam folding mirrors 30 . The scan patterns can be focused at different distances from the scanner window 32 to increase the size of the gate through which a label must pass in order to be successfully scanned. The returning light is focused by a lens 40 onto a photodetector 42 which generates an electrical signal proportional to the reflected radiation amplitude.
