## Description
This invention relates to a process for the manufacture of 1,2 dichloro 313 dimethylbut 1 ene. 1,2 Dichloro 3,3 dimethylbut 1 ene has been synthesised from trichloroethylene by reaction with tert butyl magnesium bromide J.Normant, Bull. Soc. Chim. France, 1963, Pages 1868 1875 , but the latter compound is not readily accessible and is also expensive. It has now been found that l,2 dichloro 3,3 dimethyl but l ene can be prepared in high yield by selective dehydrochlorination of 1,1,2 trichloro 3,3 dimethylbutane. According to the present invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of l,2 dichloro 3,3 dimethyl but l ene which comprises heating 1,1,2 trichloro 3,3 dimethylbutane in a polar aprotic solvent. Examples of polar aprotic solvents which may be used in the process are dimethylacetamide, diethylformamide, hexamethyiphosphoramide and especially dimethylformamide. The rate of reaction may be increased by carrying out the reaction in the presence of an alkali or alkaline earth metal halide, and this is a preferred feature of the invention. Examples of the alkali and the alkaline earth metal halides which may be used are the iodides, bromides and especially. the chlorides of lithium, sodium, potassium and calcium. 1,1, 2 Trichloro 3, 3 dimethylbutane is readily synthesised from cheap and easily available precursors, namely 1,2 dichioroethylene and tert butyl chloride, using the method described by L.Schmerling in J.Amer. Chem. Soc., 68, 1655 1946 . The reaction is carried out at a temperature from 50 to 3000C, preferably 100 to 2000 C, under superatmospheric pressure if necessary, and for a reaction time of 0.1 to 100 hrs. The amount of alkali or alkaline earth metal halide which is used may be from 0.01 to 10.0 mol, preferably 0.10 to 1.0 mol, per mol of 1,1,2 trichloro 3,3 dimethylbutane. The polar aprotic solvent may be used in an amount from 40 to 5000 by weight based on the weight of 1,1,2 trichloro 2, 2 dimethylbutane. The product may be isolated from the reaction mixture by conventional methods or, for example, by diluting the mixture with an organic solvent which is miscible with the polar aprotic solvent but immiscible with water, washing the diluted mixture with water to remove the polar aprotic solvent and inorganic salts, drying the organic layer, removing the organic solvent by distillation and fractionally distilling the residue. A suitable organic solvent for this method of isolation is methylene chloride. That 1,2 dichloro 3,3 dimethylbut l ene can be prepared by dehydrochlorination of 1,1,2 trichloro 3,3 dimethylbutane is surprising, because it would be expected that the proton most readily lost from the latter compound would be that on the carbon atom bearing two chlorine atoms, and that the product of dehydrochlorination would be 1,1 dichloro 3 ,3 dimethylbut l ene EMI2.1 and this does in fact occur exclusively when dehydrochlorination is carried out using potassium hydroxide in diethylene glycol according to the method of Br√§ndstrom in Acta. Chem. Scand., , , 610 1959 . The possibility that the process of the invention proceeds by initial formation of the expected l,l dichloro 3,3dimethylbut l ene followed by isomerisation thereof to 1,2 dichloro 3,3 dimethylbut l ene can be discounted, because heating of the l,l dichloro compound in dimethyformamide containing lithium chloride causes no isomerisation to the 1, 2 dichloro compound. Pyrolysis of 1,1, 2 trichloro 3,3 dimethylbutane gives a mixture of 1,1 and l,2 dichloro 3,3 dimethylbut l ene which is however virtually impossible to separate. The method of the present invention gives 1,2 dichloro 3, 3 dimethylbut l ene exclusively. 1,2 Dichloro 3,3 dimethylbut l ene is useful as an intermediate in the synthesis of certain fungicides and plant growth regulators, such as are described in our German Qffenlegungsschrift 2737489. The invention is illustrated but not limited by the following Example Example l 1,1, 2 Trichloro 3, 3 dimethylbutane 106.7 g 0.56 mol in dried dimethylformamide 185.0 g containing anhydrous lithium chloride 9.4 g, 0.22 mol is heated at 1600C for 6 hours. The reaction mixture is dissolved in methylene chloride 100 ml and the solution is washed with water 4 x 100 ml . The organic layer is dried and fractionally distilled to provide 1,2 dichloro 3,3 dimethylbut l ene 78 g, 0.51 mol , yield 90 based on 1,1,2 trichloro 3,3 dimethylbutane. No 1, l dichloro 3 , 3 dimethylbut 1 ene is detectable in the product.The following NMR spectrum is obtained lr 3.75, singlet, one proton, vinylic T 8.85, singlet, 8.85 protons, aliphatic. This is entirely consistent with the structure.EMI3.1 The NMR spectrum of authentic 111 dichloro 3,3 dimethylbut l ene is similar to the above except that the vinylic proton appears at r 4.05. Example 2 This is a comparative Example illustrating the dehydrochlorination of 1,1,2 trichloro 3,3 dimethylbutane using potassium bydroxide in diethylene glycol. Potassium hydroxide 0.56 g, 10 mol in diethylene glycol 3 ml is warmed to 1400C, The 1,1,2 trichloro 3,3 dimethylbutane 1.9g, 10 mol is added portionwise during 30 minutes. The heating of the reaction mixture is continued,at 1600C, for 6 hours. The mixture is poured into water and extracted with chloroforo.GLC analysis of the extract using a 1 aetreColumn of 5 E 301 at 1600C showed that the sole dehydrochlorination product is l,l dichloro 3,3 dimethylbut 1 ene. Pyrolysis of 1,1,2 trichloro 3,3 dimethylbutane in the gas phase at 520 C with a residence tiue of 20 seconds in a flow system gives a mixture of 1,2 dichloro 3,3 dimethylbut 1 ene and 1,1 dichloro 3,3 dimethylbut 1 ene in the ratio 3 1.Example 3 This is not an example of the present invention but illustrates the attempted isomerisation of 1,1 dichloro 3,3 dimethylbut l ene to the 1,2 dichloro compound. 1,1 Dichloro 3,3 dimethylbut 1 ene 8.85 g, 0.056 mol in dimethylformamide 18.5 g containing lithium chloride 0.94 g, 0.022 mol is heated at 1600C for 6 hours. No 1,2 dichloro 3,3 dimethylbut 1 ene could be detected at the end of this period by NMR analysis of the isolated product.
