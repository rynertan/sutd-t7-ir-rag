# Method of producing a low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp.

## Abstract
Method of producing a low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp, use being made of a container 5 which is positioned in the lamp vessel 1 of the lamp between the electrodes 2,3 , which container holds the quantity of mercury required for operation of the lamp, the container 5 being attached to a supporting element in the form of wire. In the method in accordance with the invention the supporting element 7 is connected to a lead in wire 2a of a first electrode 2 via a metal connecting wire 9 , a direct current discharge being generated between the container 5 and the second electrode 3 , mercury then escaping from the container. Thereafter the connection between the supporting element 7 and the lead in wire 2a is interrupted.
