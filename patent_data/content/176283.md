# Cable transfer device with lost motion coupling for governors.

## Abstract
A cable transfer device is disclosed for interconnecting the accelerator 16 and throttle 34 for installing a governor 12 in a vehicle originally equipped with a single cable between the accelerator and the throttle. The transfer device comprises a fixed shaft with a drive transmitting sleeve rotatably mounted on the shaft. An accelerator lever 28 is rotatably mounted on the sleeve and an override lever 48 is nonrotatably mounted on the sleeve. The sleeve and the accelerator lever 28 are interconnected by a torsion spring which exerts a biasing torque and a stop is provided to limit the rotation of the levers. A first cable 18 is connected between the accelerator 16 and the accelerator lever 28 and a second cable 32 is connected between the override lever 48 and the throttle 34 . A third cable 54 is connected between the overriding throttle closing member 54 of the governor 12 and the override lever 48 .
