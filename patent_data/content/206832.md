# UPGRADING OF COMPOSITES

## Abstract
Substrates such as chipboard or cement aggregate board are upgraded with a cured rubber layer by forming on the substrate a composite of uncured but curable rubber sheeting containing a heat activatable curative with an intermediate film of polar thermosetting resin, and hot pressing the uncured composite so as to form polar bonds between the resin and substrate with simultaneous co vulcanisation of the rubber and the resin.
