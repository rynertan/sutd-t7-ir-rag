# A TAG

## Abstract
A one piece tag formed from a resilient plastics material comprises a mounting member 12 and a pair of panels 10, 11 attached thereto. The mounting member 12 has a pair of limb portions 12a coupled together by an intermediate portion 13 . A panel 10, 11 extends from the end of each limb portion 12a . Coupling means 14 is provided adjacent the free end of one panel and an applicator tool can engage the tag via the coupling means. The panel is thus able to be forced through an object, such as the ear of an animal, by the applicator so that the intermediate portion 13 resides within the opening formed in the object and a panel lies either side of the opening.
