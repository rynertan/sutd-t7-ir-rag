# Improved dehydrohalogenation process.

## Abstract
Improvement in the catalytic dehydrohalogenation of a halogenated hydrocarbon to an ethylenically unsaturated pro duct with aqueous alkali in a series of reactors in a cascade ar rangement, wherein the fresh alkali feed is relocated from the first reactor to a reactor subsequent to the first, and partly spent alkali solution from the last reactor is recirculated to the first reactor, while the ethylenically unsaturated product is re covered from the effluent from the last reactor, and waste brine is removed from the effluent from the reactor immediate ly preceding that to which fresh alkali is fed. In this manner, the amount of both the alkali and the catalyst can be reduced, and the conversion is increased. Dehydrochlorination of 3,4 di chlorobutene 1 gives chloroprene, which is a valuable mono mer for making synthetic elastomers.
