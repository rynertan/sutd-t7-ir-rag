# Screw rotors.

## Abstract
Screw rotors having a symmetricaly tooth profile and used in a screw type rotary compressor or expander. The tooth profile of the female rotor is formed such that a line H₂ A₂ is formed by a generated curve of a point A₁ of the male rotor a line A₂ B₂ is formed by a circular arc having a point O₇ as its centre and a radius R₇ a line B₂ C ₂ is formed by an envelope developed by a circular arc B₁ C₁ of the male rotor a portion between points D ₂ and E₂ is formed by a circular arc having a point O₁ as its centre and a radius R₁ a line C D is formed by a line smoothly connecting the lines B₂ C ₂ and D ₂ E₂ a line E₂ F₂ is formed by a circular arc having a point O₂ as its centre and a radius R₂ and a line F₂ G₂ is formed by a circular arc having a point 0₈ as its centre and a radius R₈. The tooth profile of the male rotor is formed such that a line H₁ A₁ is formed by a generated curve of a point H₂ of the female rotor a line A₁ B₁ is formed by an envelope developed by the arc A₂ B₂ of the female rotor a line B₁ C₁ is formed by a circular arc having a point O₄ as its centre and a radius R₄ a line C D₁ is formed by a circular arc having the rotating centre of the male rotor as its centre and a radius R₅ and lines D₁ E₁ , E₁ F₁ and F₁ G₁ are generated by arcs D₂ E₂ , E₂ F₂ and F₂ G₂ respectively of the female rotor tooth profile.
