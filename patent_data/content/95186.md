# DEVICE FOR WEB REMOVAL FROM A CYLINDER

## Abstract
The invention relates to a device for a web, which can be removed from a cylinder 3 , said web preferably being a paper web. A band shaped doctor blade 5 , which is designed to extend along the mantle surface 3A of the cylinder, and which is made possible to be fed in the longitudinal direction of the blade, brings about the removal of the web. The device makes possible a rational and simple forward feed and change of the doctor blade 5 , when said blade is worn during its bearing against the mantle surface 3A of the cylinder, and the time of cost consuming interruptions in connection with the outfeed of the web is thereby reduced, and also the size of the plant is reduced. The blade 5 can be collected round a winding up mechanism 13 formed as an expandable chuck 14 , which is connected with a driving means, which is adapted to feed the band shaped doctor blade 5 at such a chosen speed that it moves with a multiple of the time calculated for the wear of the band in order to make possible a reciprocating feed until the calculated degree of wear is reached.
