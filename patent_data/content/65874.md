## Description
SPECIFICATION 2 Aminophenol Derivatives, methods for their preparation and composition containing the same. This invention is concerned to new 2 aminophenol derivatives which have an inhibitory activity on 5 lipoxygenase specifically or an inhibitory activity on 5 lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase at the same time, a process for their preparation and a pharmaceutical composition containing them or it as active ingredient s . Up to now, several compounds which inhibit lipoxygenase have been known, that is to say, 5,8,11, 14 eicosatetraynoic acid i.e. EY A . 528,ll eicosatrienioc acid, acetone phenylhydrazone i.e. APE , phenidone i.e. l phenyl 3 pyrazolidone , NDGA nordihydroguaiaretic acid , BW 775C 3 amino l p trifluorome thyl pyrazole , 3 amino l p chlorophenyl 2 pyrazoline, benoxaprofene. These above compounds inhibit all lipoxygenases and other enzymes in the arachidonic cascade at the same time, or inhibit all liposygenases of 5 , 12 and 15 lipoxygenase see Genii Iryou 12, 1065 1980 . The compounds of the present invention are particularly superior in having selective inhibitory activity on 5 lipoxygenase of many lipoxygenases which react at the first stage of producing various kinds of leukotrienes from arachidonic acid in a living body and further not inhibiting other enzymes in the arachidonate cascade,or having inhibitory activity on 5 lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase which reacts at the first step of producing prostaglandins from arachidonic acid similarly, at the same time. This invention is concerned to new 2 aminophenol derivatives which have an inhibitory activity on 5 lipoxygenase or an inhibitory activity on 5 lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase, a process for their preparation and a pharmaceutical composition containing them as active ingredients. More particularly, there are a group of compounds called leukotrienes, which are biosynthesized from arachidonic acid by a series of reactions in a living body and 5 lipoxygenase is related at the first step of this reaction, and similarly, prostaglandins are biosynthesized from arachidonic acid, and cyclooxygenase is related at the first step of the reaction.This invention is concerned to new 2 aminophenol derivatives which strongly inhibit S lipoxygenase,or 5 lipoxyganase and cyclooxygenase at the same time, and are therefore useful as treating agents and preventing agents for diseases which are induced by leukotrienes e.g. allergic tracheal and bronchial diseases or allergic lung diseases, allergic shock and also various allergic inflammations which are induced by prostaglandins, and a process for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions comprising them as active ingredients. In the study of prostaglandins abbreviated as PG hereafter , many important discoveries have been made continuously in recent years.And so it was found a large change in the direction of the research and development of PG. In the compounds which have been riewly found or newly confirmed their structure in PG family, it can be said thatPG endoperoxides, i.e. PGC2 and PCH2 , thromboxane A abbreviatet as TSA2 hereafter , prostacyclin i.e. PGI2 and leukotrienes B, C, D and E abbreviated as LTB, LTC, LTD and LTE, respectively, hereafter etc. have especially strong and unique biological activities. All the compounds of PG family containing various PG known well in addition to the above compounds, are biosynthesized from the same mother compound, i.e. arachidonic acid and, therefore, the metabolic routes starting from arachidonic acid is called Arachidonate cascade as a whole. The detailed explanation of each route and the pharmacological character of each metabolite are described in Igaku no Ayumi, 114, 378 1980 , ibid, 114, 462 1980 , ibid, 114, 866 1980 , ibid, 114, 929 1980 , Gendai Iryo, 12, 909 1980 , ibid, 12, 1029 1980 , ibid, 12, 1065 1980 and ibid, 12, 1105 1980 etc. The arachidonate cascade can be largely divided into two routes one is the route that cyclooxygenase acts on arachidonic acid to convert into various PG e.g. prostaglandin F2a abbreviated PGF2a hereafter , prostaglandin E2 abbreviated PGE2 hereafter , PGI2, TXA2 through PGG2 and the other is the route that lipoxygenase reacts on arachidonic acid to convert into hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid abbreviated as RETE hereafter or leukotriene through hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid abbreviated HPETE hereafter . Concerning the former route, it has been known well, so we do not describe here the details. See Makoto Katori et al,Prostaglandin 1978 published by Kohdan sha. Concerning the latter route, it has been known that various componds are produced according to the following scheme I. Scheme IEMI4.1 As well known, arachidonic acid is metabolized to various PGs via PG endoperoxides such as PGG2 and PCH2. Arachidonic acid is also metabolized to 5 HPETE, 12 HPETE and 15 HPETE.by the action of 5 lipoxygenase, 12 lipoxygenase and 13 lipoxygenase, respectively.EMI5.1 These HPETE are converted into 5 HETE, 12 HETE and 15 HETE, respectively by the action of peroxidase converting a hydroperoxyl group into a hydroxyl group. Furthermore, LTA is also produced from 5 HPETE. LTA is converted into leukotriene B abbreviated as LTB hereafter enzymatically or not enzymatically, or is converted intoLTC by the action of glutathion S transf erase. Further, LTC is converted into LTD by the action of y glutamyl transpeptidase. Moreover, it w as recently defined that LTD is metabolized to LTE. see Biochem. Biophys. Res. Cpmmun., 91, 1266 1979 andProstaglandins, 19 5 , 645 1980 1 It was defined that LTC and LTD are the same compound as SRS slow reacting substance or SRS A slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis which vas well known before. see Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 76, 4275 1979 , Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 91, 1266 1980 , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77, 2014 1980 and Nature, 285, 104 1980 1So it can be understood that the pharmacological characters of these leukotrienes are the same as those of SRS or SRS A. Feldberg et al. reported that a substance is released when perfusing cobra venom through isolated lung or incubating cobra venom with vitellus. The substance was named SRS, it has been found thatSRS constricts ilem isolated from guinea pig slowly and continually. see J. Physiol., 94, 187 1938 1 Moreover, Kellaway et al. showed the relation between SRS A and allergic reaction from the fact that SRS A was released when an antigen was sensitized to perfusing lung isolated from guinea pig. see Quant. J. Exp. Physiol., 30, 121 1940 Brocklehurst reported that when the antigen was sensitized to a lung fragment isolated from a bronchial asthmatics whose specific antigen has been defined, by an operation, histamine and SRS A were released and they could strongly constrict bronchial muscle. Since such constriction could not be prevented by an antihistaminic agent, he suggested that SRS A is an important bronchoconstrictor in an asthmatic paroxysm. see Progr. Allergy, 6, 539 1962 Since then, many reports were published, for instance, SRS A prepared from human lung slice constrict a tracheal spiral of normal human. see Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol., 38, 217 1970 When SRS A prepared from rats or guinea pigs was injected intravenously, significant increase of purlmonory resistance was observed. see J. Clin. Invest., 53, 1679 1974 In addition, a subcataneous injection of SRS A to guinea pig, rat and monkey could make to enhance vascular permiability. see Advances in Immunology, 10, 105 1969 , J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 621, 371 1978 , Prostaglandins, 19 5 , 779 1980 etc. Generally, the substance released by immunological reaction is called SRS A. On the other hand, the substance released by non immunological reaction such as calcium ionophore is called SRS. However, the above two substances have many similarities each other and, therefore, it is considered they would probably be the same substance. Based on result of those studies, various leukotrienes biosynthesized from arachidonic acid via LTA LTC, LTD and LTE, and further other leukotrienes which may be confirmed their structures hereafter are considered to be important factors relating to the appearance of allergic tracheal and bronchial disease, allergic lung disease, allergic shock and various allergic inflammations. Recently, it was proposed that PG is an important chemical mediator of inflammatory reaction. For example, it was reported thatPGE enhance a vascular permiability and a pain. In addition, PGE have a vasodilative action, pyrogenetic action and chemotactic action. tsee Makoto Katori et al, Prostaglandin 1978 , published by Kohdan sha Furhtermore, it was reported that PGIz alone does not affected vascular permiability, but it enhance vascular permiability of histamine. tsee Prostaglandins, 15, 557 1978 Moreover, the most recent report indicated that for surpressing PG s action, it is more effective to inhibit not only 5 lipoxygenase but also cyclooxygenase at the same time. see Biochemcal Pharmacology, 28, 1959 1979 and European Journal ofPharmacology, 66, 81 1980 As the result of energestic investigations in order to find new compounds inhibiting 5 lipoxygenase,or 5 lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase at the same time in a living body, and so being effective for prevention and treatment of various diseases induced by not only leukotrienes but also PGs, we have found the compounds which is achieved that purpose, completed this invention.
