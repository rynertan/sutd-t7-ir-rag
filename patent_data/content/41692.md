## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a blood oxygenator for oxygenating blood and simultaneously removing carbon dioxide therefrom in extracorporeal circulation during surgery. Blood oxygenators have been developed and used in practice as a component for effecting extracorporeal circulation during cardiotomy surgery. The function of blood oxygenator is to transfer oxygen into the venous blood with simultaneous removal of carbon dioxide therefrom. Three principal types of blood oxygenators are known.In the bubble oxygenator, bubbles of oxygen gas are directly introduced into the blood. The bubble oxygenator is generally disposable after use, easy to handle, reliable in oxygenation performance, and is, therefore, currently in wide use.However, there exist certain defects of remarkable blood damage such as hemolysis and the danger of introducing fine oxygen gas bubbles into the patient resulting in vascular embolism. In the rotary disc oxygenator, a thin film of blood is exposed to an oxygen atmosphere. Here, hemolysis is less remarkable than in bubble oxygenators but it suffers certain disadvantages such as larger priming volume and difficulty of construction in disposable form. In the membrane oxygenator, a gas permeable membrane separates the blood from theoxygen gas, and gas exchange takes place by diffusion across the membrane. This type of oxygenator has less priming volume and less remarkable hemolytic characteristic than other two types, and has been increasingly used in practice. As the basic requirements, the membrane must have the following properties 1 It has a high permeability to oxygen gas and carbon dioxide gas. 2 It has a good bio compatibility, particularly the hemolysis is minimum. 3 It contains no pinhole and has a good mechanical strength. One type of the membrane such as silicone membrane utilizes the dissolution and diffusion of oxygen gas or carbon dioxide gas in the membrane material. Not only in the membrane oxygenator but also in other membrane diffusion devices, it is well known that the diffusion rate depends on not only that of the membrane itself but also that of the boundary film of fluid formed on the both sides of membrane. Accordingly, the overall resistance to diffusion is the sum of intramembrane resistance plus boundary film resistance. If the former is negligibly low, the mass transfer rate through a given membrane is mainly controlled by the boundary film resistance. It is for this reason that the silicone membrane has relatively high permeabilities to oxygen gas and carbon dioxide gas.The silicone membrane of sufficient thickness exhibits, however, a poor C02 releasing rate compared with its 02 absorption rate, and often causes hemolysis when the membrane is reinforced with fillers such as fine silica particles. There is another type of membrane which employs a quite different permeation mechanism from that of the silicone membrane. It comprises a hydrophobic microporous membrane such as microporous polypropylene membranes sold by CellaneseCorporation under commercial names of CELLGUARD and DURAGUARD.These membranes have a number of elongated microholes having a pore size, for example, of 0.02 x 0.4 Fm and a porosity up to several tens percent. Because of hydrophobic nature, the membrane prevents the passage of water but permits the passage of a gas through the membrane below a predetermined level of pressure. Thus, the oxygen and carbone dioxide can diffuse in opposite directions through the microholes of membrane without allowing the blood from passing through the membrane, so that absorption of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide take place.The gas permeability of membrane of this type is, therefore, far greater than that of silicone membrane, and the diffusion constant thereof will be at least 1,000 times higher than that of silicone membrane even the average pore size is sufficiently small to allow Knudsen flow of gas, namely about 0.01 Rm. This enables the reduction of surface area of membrane at least by about 20 compared with the silicone membrane oxygenator, although more drastic reduction of surface area is impossible because the mass transfer rate is predominantly controlled by the boundary film resistance. Other examples of membrane of this class include microporous polyterafluoroethylene membranes, microporous polycarbonate membranes, silicone or paraffin treated microporous hydrophilic membranes and the like. All of membranes of this class are, however, of an isotropic structure and have an average pore size greater than 0.01 pm. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, a blood oxygenator is provided comprising a microporous membrane for separating blood from oxygen gas, a first chamber for flowing blood positioned on one side of the membrane and a second chamber for flowing oxygen gas on the opposite side of membrane. The membrane is non hydrophilic and has a critical surface tension less than the surface tension of blood at 37C. The membrane has a porous layer and, integral therewith, a skin layer of 0.01 to 3 pin thick having an average pore size of less than 100 A. The skin layer is dry in use and the pressure of blood side is maintained at a level higher than the pressure of oxygen gas side but less than the minimum pressure at which the blood begins to penetrate into the membrane. The membrane oxygenator of the present invention may be more effective than conventional prior art membrane oxygenators. For example, an membrane oxygenator having a membrane surface area of 0.8 m2 was assembled using an anisotropic membrane of 50 pin total thick made of dichlorodiphenylsulfone bisphenol condensate resin having a porosity of 70 , and a skin layer of 1 pin thick having an average pore size of less than 100 A. This oxygenator was tested by flowing blood at a pressure of 203 mmHg on the skin layer side and oxygen gas at a pressure of 2 mmHg on the porous layer side.At a partiall pressure of oxygen gas of 40 mmHg and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 50 mmHg gas in the blood, the oxygenator exhibited an 02 absorption rate and a C02 releasing rate which are 1.3 times and 2.2 times, respectively, higher than those of a silicone membrane oxygenator having a corresponding effective surface area of 100 pin thick under same conditions, or 1.2 times and 1.3 times, respectively, higher than those of a porous polypropylene membrane oxygenator of 25 pin thick having a number of elliptic pore of an average size of 0.02 x 0.4 pin and a porosity of 50 under same conditions. Thus, the oxygenator of this invention is superior to prior art membrane oxygenators in its high C02 expulsion rate.This is because the membrane used in this invention is of anisotropic structure having a compact skin layer and a porous layer which is substantially less resistant to gas permeation so that the overall resistance of membrane to gas permeation is nearly equal to that of skin layer of, for example, 1 pin thick. The porous layer serves as a reinforcement. Blood damage such as hemolysis in the oxygenator of this invention is minimum or far less than in silica fiiled silicone membrane oxygenators and conventional microporous membrane oxygenato rs. This may be explained by the fact that blood flows while being in contact with a relatively smooth surface of skin layer and the polysulfone resin used has a high compatibility with blood. One of characteristic features of this invention resides in the use of a microporous, anisotropic membrane having a compact skin layer of the above described type.It is preferable to place the membrane so that its skin layer faces the blood side and the porous layer faces the oxygen gas side within the oxygenator of the present invention. The orientation of membrane in this manner gives additional effects in that the permeability to gas is greater than in reverse orientation and that the danger of passage of oxygen gas bubbles into the blood is minimized even when the pressure of oxygen side becomes higher than the pressure of blood side by an accident. Another characteristic feature of the oxygenator of this invention is that the membrane is non hydrophilic and has a critical surface tension less than the surface tention of blood at 37cC. The pressure of blood side separated by the membrane from the oxygen gas side must be maintained at a level higher than the pressure of oxygen gas side but less than the minimum pressure at which the blood is expelled through the membrane. If the critical surface tension of membrane is greater than the surface tension of blood, the membrane will be fully wetted with blood and the micropores therein will be filled with blood. Since the principle of microporous membrane oxygenators is to diffuse oxygen gas and carbon dioxide gas in opposite directions in a gaseous phase defined by each of the microholes of membrane, the oxygenator cannot function properly if such microholes are filled with blood. This could be avoided by applying a higher pressure to the oxygen gas side than to blood side but this approach will give rise to a serious danger of introducing oxygen gas bubbles into the blood and returning the same to the patient.It is for this reason that the pressure of blood side should be higher than the pressure of oxygen gas side and the critical surface tension should be higher than the surface tension of blood at 37s. For example, the surface tension of standard bovine whole blood is found to be about 65 dyne cm. The surface tension of human blood varies depending upon health conditions and the body temperature of a particular patient but generally ranges from about 60 to about 70 dyne cm. Accordingly, the membrane should have a critical surface tension below said value. If the pressure differential between the blood side and oxygen gas side exceeds to a certain limit, the blood will be forced to fill microholes in the membrane. This pressure differential at which the blood begins to fill the microholes is hereinafter referred to as minimum penetration pressure . This value varies with the material of particular membranes, pore size and configuration of microholes.For instance, the above described membrane made of dichlorodiphenylsulfone bisphenol condensate resin has a critical surface tension of about 50 dyne cm at 37T and the minimum penetration pressure of 2.2 icg cm2. Accordingly, if the pressure of blood side in this case is maintained at a level higher than the pressure of oxygen gas side keeping the pressure differential within said value, blood will not pass to the oxygen gas side or alternatively oxygen gas will not pass to the blood side through the membrane. The membrane used in the oxygenator of this invention is an anisotropic membrane having a skin layer including a number of microholes. The pore size of microholes is large enough such that the flow of gas there through is permitted as Knudsen flow rather than the dissolution difftsion. To this end the average pore size preferably ranges from about 10 to 100 A, more preferably from about 20 to 50 A.Preferably the ekin layer to as thin as possible tor higher permeability but a thickness from 0.01 to 3 Fm, typically about 1 ym is preferable for strength reason. The pore size and thickness may be easily determined by an electron microscope. The pore size and thickness of porous layer are not critical but preferably the porous layer has a pore size greater than 0.01 pin, particularly from 0.1 to 20 pin, and a thickness from 10 to 500 pin, particularly from 20 to 70 pin.The pore size and thickness of porous layer may also be determined by an electron microscope. The porosity of membrane is not critical and desirably as great as possible unless the strength property of membrane is unduly impaired. A pair of membrane may be used as a single unit with skin layers facing each other. Alternatively, a single membrane may be overlaid by a suitable support such as polypropylene nonwoven fabrics, porous sheets or nettings. The material of membrane used in the present invention desirably has a contact angle with blood less than 900. If the material having a contact angle higher than 900, for example, polyterafluoroethylene is used, oxygen gas bubbles may be generated in the blood when the pressure of oxygen gas exceeds the pressure of blood side. Therefore, the pressure differential across the membrane must be controlled accurately and a precise safety device is required.With the use of a material having a contact angle less than 900, however, generation of oxygen gas bubbles may be avoided provided that the reversal of pressure differential is kept within a certain limit. This limit varies depending upon the nature of membrane material, maximum pore size and configuration of pores on blood side. When, for example, the abovementioned dichlorodiphenylsulfone bisphenol resin membrane is used with the skin layer facing the blood side, the value of this limit is from 50 to 150 mmHg. This eliminates the danger of returning oxygen gas bubbles to the patient due to accidential reversal of pressure differential between the blood side and the oxygen gas side. As previously stated, the critical surface tension of membrane should be less than the surface tension of blood at 37 and specifically less than 70 dyne cm, preferably less than 60 dyne cm. Any material having the above described parameters may be used. Examples of suitable materials include polysulfone resins, polyvinyl fluoride, polyvinylidene chloride and the like. Polysulfone resins are preferable for their excellent bio compatibility. A polyether sulfone resin described in CHEMTECH, July 1975, pages 426 432 such as those sold under commercial names of ASTREL 360 3M , polyether sulfone 720P and 200P I.C.I. and UDEL POLYSULFONE U.C.C. may be used. The membrane used in the present invention may be prepared from these materials by any known method. For example, a method described in Japanese Laid Open PatentApplication 42765 1976 or 16381 1979 may be employed for the manufacture of membrane used in the present invention. The oxygenator of this invention may be of any known design using the membrane in various forms such as envelopes, flat sheets, hollow fibers and the like. For example, an elongated envelope of membrane may be wound around a cylindrical core to form a coil and placed in a casing. Inlet and outlet ports are provided in communication with each flow path defined in the interior and the exterior of the envelope.An oxygenator of this design is shown in Japanese Laid OpenPatent Application 135488 1974. Alternatively, a plurality of envelopes of membrane may be stacked with periphery of each open end being bonded together, and placed in a casing. Manifold means are provided adjacent opposite ends and opposite sides of the stack to communicate with their respective ports. An example of this design may be seen in a dialyzer described in Japanese PatentPublication 22960 1973. In these oxygenators, the blood path may be either interior or exterior of the envelope but preferably faces the skins layer of membrane. It is also desirable that each turn or wall of envelope is spaced from the adjacent ones by a spacer or disturber to permit fluid flow and to produce a turbulent flow for reducing the boundary film resistance.Suitable spacer or disturber means are a mesh screen made of inert material. Another design of oxygenators may be seen in JapaneseLaid Open Patent Application 12873 1978. Here, the membrane is convoluted to define a pair of plurality of fluid paths in interleaving relation on opposite sides of membrane. Each one of the pair of fluid paths communicates with an inlet and an outlet. It is also desirable for this design to place screen support means between the adjacent turns of membrane. In these stacked or convoluted membrane oxygenators, it will be understood that a plurality of anisotropic membrane walls are overlaid in face to face and back to back relations alternately and a pair of plurality of fluid flow paths are formed on oppsite sides of anisotropic membrane. The oxygenator of this invention may be of hollow fiber design. In this case a bundle of a large number of hollow filaments is placed in a cylindrical casing and held in position within the casing by bonding filaments together and with the inside wall of casing at both ends with a curable potting compound. This construction is popular in hollow fiber hemodialyzers. To further illustrate the invention, the following non limiting examples are presented. Unless otherwise indicated all percents are by weight.EXAMPLE 1 A solution consisting of polysulfone UDEL polysulfone P1700, U.C.C. 22 propylene glycol 14 and, N methyl 2 pyrrolidone 64 was cast on a polyester film uniformly and soaked in water at 30S. The resulting membrane became strippable from the polyester film after complete coagulation. This membrane was withdrawn, thoroughly washed with water and dried at 140or for 2 minutes. The membrane has a thickness of 60 pin, a moisture content of 1.2 and a yield point of 390 g cm at a test speed of 1 cm sec. A section in the vicinity of skin layer of this membraned viewed by an electron microscope is shown in FIG. 1. An exprimental oxygenator shown in FIG. 2 was assembled using this membrane as membrane 6 in FIG. 2.The width h of gas exchange chamber of gas exchanger 1 is 0.8 mm. Screens 2 and 3 are placed in flow paths on opposite sides of membrane 6 and each are polyester netting having 30 strands inch of 100 x 50 mm size. Water was pnmpeci through the inlet port 4 at a flow rate of 430 ml min., while oxygen gas was flown through the inlet port 5 at a flow rate of 1,000 ml min. The amount of absorbed oxygen was determined from partial pressures of oxygen Pi and Po at inlet and outlet, and the mass transfer coefficient relative to oxygen was calculated by the following equation EMI13.1 wherein V is the volume of absorbed oxygen cm3 , A is the effective surface area of membrane cm2 , cx is the solubility constant of oxygen in water cm302 cm3H20.atm. , PG is the partial pressure of oxygen in gas phase, and PL is the partial pressure of oxygen in water. The results obtained are as follows When flowing water on the skin layer side, K 110 x 10 4 cm sec., and when flowing oxygen gas on the skin layer side, K 55 x 10 4 cm sec. In a similar way, the mass transfer coefficient relative to carbon dioxide was determined. The results obtained are as follows When flowing water on the skin layer side, K 102 x 10 4 cm sec., and when flowing carbon dioxide gas on the skin layer side, K 43 x 10 4 cm sec. A pressure differential was created across the membrane by elevating the gas pressure and the value at which bubbles begin to appear in the water phase bubbling point was determined. The bubbling point was 150 mitfflg when flowing water on the skin layer side, and 53 mmHg when flowing gas on the skin layer side, respectively. Various parameters of the anisotropic membrane used in the example are as follows Skin layer about 0.5 pin thick, pore size less than 100 A. Porous layer about 60 pin thick, pore size 0.1 7 pin. Critical surface tension 50 dyne cm. Minimum penetration pressure 2.2 kg cm2 at 37S. Contact angle blood 570 at 37or. EXAMPLE 2 A solution consisting of polysulfone UDEL polysulfone .P1700, U.C.C. 23y propylene glycol and, N methyl 2 pyrrolidone 61 was extruded through an annular nozzle while filling the interior of extrudate with water. The extrudate was fully coagulated in a water bath, thoroughly washed with water and dried at 120d for 10 minutes. The resultant hollow filament has an inner diameter of 0.2 mm, an outer diameter of 0.3 mm and a wall thickness of 0.05 .mm. This hollow filament has skin layers on both inner and outer surfaces each having a thickness of about 0.2 pin and minute pores of a pore size less than 100 A. The porous layer has a thickness of about 50 pin and a pore size of 0.1 3 pin. The minimum penetration pressure of this hollow filament was determined by filling the interior of hollow filament with blood. The value obtained was 2.1 kg cm2 at 37s. The critical surface tension of this hollow fiber membrane was 50 dyne cm at 37d and the contact angle with blood at 370C was 530 An oxygenator was assembled from this filament. 3060 filaments of an effective length of 18 cm were bundled to give an effective inner surface area of 3700 cm2. Using the resultant oxygenator, water was pumped through the interior of hollow filaments at a flow rate of 320 ml min., while oxygen gas was flown along the exterior of filaments at 1000 ml min. The mass transfer coefficient measured as in Example 1 was 32 x 10 4 cm sec., and the bubbling point was 145 mmHg. Similarly, the mass transfer coefficient relative to carbon dioxide was determined and found to be 34 x 10 4 cm sec. The ratio of mass transfer coefficient of oxygen gas to that of carbon dioxide gas is 0.94, which is far lower than the corresponding ratio of a commercial silicone membrane oxygenator, which is about 2. This means that the membrane used herein is highly permeable to carbon dioxide gas as well. This oxygenator was then dried by passing dry air at room temperature through the interior of hollow filaments at a flow rate of 3 liter min. for 5 hours. Bovine whole blood having a hematocrit value of 35 was pumped through hollow part of filaments at a flow rate of 380 ml min. at 37S, while oxygen gas was flown along the exterior of filaments at 1000 ml min. The outlet of oxygen gas was opened to the atmosphere and, therefore, the gauge pressure of oxygen gas within the oxygenature was nearly zero. The pressure of blood side within the oxygenator was 160 mmHg at the blood inlet, and 31 mmHg at the blood outlet, respectively. The partial pressure of oxygen in the blood was 40.9 mmEg at the inlet and 107 mmHg at the outlet, respectively. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood was 36.0 mmHg at the inlet and 29.8 mmHg at the outlet, respectively. The oxygen gas uptake was then 20.0 ml min. These data show that the performance of the oxygenator of this example may be accepted in practical use. A hemolysis test was carried out with the above oxygenator using a circuit schematically shown in FIG. 3.1,000 ml of heparine added bovine whole blood 9 having a hematocrit value of 35 was placed in a reservoir 8 and maintained at a constant temperature of 37S in a water bath 7.Blood was circulated by a roller pump 10 through the oxygenater 11 at a flow rate of 380 ml min. Oxygen gas was not supplied during the test. The amount of hemolysis per hour was 6.9 mg dl hour. For comparison, a similar test was carried out with a commercial Kolobow membrane oxygenator having an effective membrane surface area of 0.8 m2. The amount of hemolysis in this case was 44 mg dl.hour at a blood flow rate of 800 ml min. This shows that the amount of hemolysis of the oxygenator of this example is very small.EXAMPLE 3 Example 1 was repeated to give an anisotropic membrane of 100 pin thick, 300 mm wide and 10 m long. The resultant membrane has a skin layer of 0.5 pin thick having minutes pores of a pore size less than 100 A. The porous layer has a thickness of about 100 pm and a pore size of 0.1 7 Fm. The critical surface tension of this membrane was 50 dyne cm at 37 and the minimum penetration pressure was 2.3 kg cm2 at 37cue The contact angle with blood at 37S was 0 57 An oxygenator shown in FIG. 4 and FIG. 5 was assembled by convoluting the membrane 16 to define a pair of plurality of flow paths on opposite sides of membrane 16. Each turn of convoluted membrane 16 is spaced from the adjacent turns by a polyester mesh screen 17 of 30 pin thick and 30Q x 50 mm in size. The resulting rectangular assembly having a size of 300 x 55 x 65 mm was placed in a casing shown in FIG. 4 and sealed to inner walls of casing with an adhesive except those areas facing port chambers 12 through 15.The effective surface area of the resultant oxygenator was about 1.6 m2. Water was pumped through flow paths on the skin layer side of membrane at a flow rate of 1,600 ml min., while oxygen gas was passed through flow paths on the porous layer side of membrane at a flow rate of 1,500 ml min. The mass transfer coefficients relative to oxygen and carbondioxide, measured as in Examples 1 and 2, were 37 x 10 4 cm sec. and 40 x 10 4 cm s ec., respectively. The bubbling point was 112 mmHg. As in Example 2, the oxygenator was dried, and bovine whole blood having a hematocrit value of 35 was passed through flow paths on the skin layer side at a flow rate of 1,600 ml min. at 37or, while oxygen gas was passed through flow paths on the porous layer side at a flow rate of 1,500 ml min. The gauge pressure of oxygen gas was nearly zero. The pressure of blood side was 198 mmHg at the inlet and 39 mmHg at the outlet, respectively. The partial pressure of oxygen in blood was 35.1 mmHg at the inlet and 176.0 mmHg at the outlet, respectively. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide in blood was 36.0 mmHg at the inlet and 29.3 mmHg at the outlet, respectively. The oxygen uptake was 113.1 ml min. Hemolysis test was carried out on this oxygenator as in Example 2. The amount of hemolysis was 8.3 mg dl.hour. The above has been offered for illustrative purposes only, and it is not for the purpose of limiting the scope of this invention which is defined in the claims below.
