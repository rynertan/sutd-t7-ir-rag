# Flavorant compounds, their pyrolysis products, and smoking and food compositions containing them.

## Abstract
Tobacco and non tobacco smoking compositions containing a heterocyclic hydroxy substituted carboxylic acid corresponding to the formula CHEM wherein X is a heterocyclic substituent containing from 2 to 12 carbon atoms, and any heteroatom in X is selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur, for example pyrazyl and pyridyl radicals, R is a substituent selected from aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic groups containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, R 1 and R 2 are hydrogen or substituents selected from aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic groups containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and R 1 and R 2 , when taken together with connecting elements, form an alicyclic structure, or a corresponding salt thereof. Under smoking conditions the additive and its pyrolysis products flavour the mainstream and sidestream smoke.
