## Description
The present invention is directed toward a pharmaceutical composition containing a renal vasodilator and antihypertensive agent more particularly, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Antihypertensive agents are known see e.g., U.S. Patent 4,129,571, U.S. Patent 4,154,960, U.S. Patent 4,052,511, U.S. Patent 4,374,829 . A particularly preferred class of these compounds are those disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,374,829. Recently, a novel class of prostanoic acid type compounds having pharmacological activity have been disclosed see, e.g., U.S. Patent 4,225,609, U.S. Patent 4,379,792 and U.S. Patent 4,260,771 . These compounds are racemic mixtures of interphenylene 9 thia 11 oxo 12 azaprostanoic acid and are especially effective renal vasodilators. More recently, a process was developed for separating these interphenylene racemates to obtain derivatives of interphenylene 9 thia 11 oxo 12 azaprostanoic acid as optically pure enantiomers see U.S. Patent 4,390,703 and it is these optically pure enantiomers that are the preferred renal vasodilators in the composition of this invention. It has been discovered that the combination of these preferred renal vasodilator compounds and the preferred antihypertensive agents produces a composition having enhanced pharmacological activity. A pharmaceutical composition containing an interphenylene 9 thia 11 oxo 12 aza prostanoic acid type renal vasodilator and a carboxyalkyl dipeptide antihypertensive agent. An embodiment of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition useful for treating hypertension which comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier an antihypertensively effective amount of a renal vasodilator compound which is an optically pure enantiomer selected from the group or 4 3 3 2 1 hydroxycyclohexyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoic acid or 4 3 3 2 1 hydroxycyclopentyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoic acid or 4 3 3 2 1 hydroxycycloheptyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoic acid or 4 3 3 2 1 hydroxy 4,4 dimethylcyclohexyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoic acid or 4 3 3 2 9 hydroxy 9 bicylco 3.3.1 nonyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoic acid or 4 4 3 2 1 hydroxycyclohexyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl butyl benzoic acid or 4 3 3 3 1 hydroxycyclohexyl propyl 4 oxo 2 thiazoidinyl propyl benzoic acid or 4 3 3 3 1 hydroxycyclohexyl Preferred are compositions wherein said renal vasodilator compound is or 4 3 3 2 1 hydroxycyclohexyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoic acid and, said antihypertensive compound is a member selected from the group consisting of N 1 S ethoxycarbonyl 3 phenylpropyl L alanyl L proline N 1 S carboxy 3 phenylpropyl L alanyl L proline N α 1 S carboxy 3 phenylpropyl L lysyl L proline and, the maleate salts of said antihypertensive compounds. The above described antihypertensive compounds, their use, and methods for their preparation are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,374,829. The above described renal vasodilator compounds, their use and the method of preparation thereof are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,225,609. The resolution of the renal vasodilator diastereomeric compounds into their preferred optically pure enantiomers is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,390,703. This resolution process comprises The following flow sheet, illustrates the resolution process to obtain optically pure enantiomers of renal vasodilator compounds As outlined above in the flow scheme, the present process consists of four steps The benzoic acid is generally protected as an ester which can be removed easily via hydrolysis under mild conditions. Thus interphenylene 9 thia 11 oxo 12 azaprostanoic acid is treated with an esterifying agent such as, for example, an alcohol or an alkyl halide in the presence of a catalyst to form a benzoate as exemplified by the formula of the benzoate of Example 1 wherein R is R² or R³ as described in, the following N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide β trichloromethyl β propiolactone N,N carbonyldiimidazole triphenylphosphine and diethylazodicarboxylate 1 methyl 2 chloropyridinium iodide or 6 chloro 1 The preferred alcohol to be used is methanol or benzyl alcohol. The reaction is usually carried out in an excess amount of an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst. Under acidic conditions, the preferred catalysts are boron trifluoride etherate and sulfuric acid molecular sieve. A typical procedure involves the refluxing of the benzoic acid, for example, compound 1, in an alcohol with a suitable catalyst under anhydrous conditions. The refluxing continues with or without stirring until a substantial amount of the acid is converted to the ester. Usually it requires about 0.5 to 48 hours, preferably about 2 to 6 hours to obtain optimal yield. Generally, reaction temperatures vary with the boiling point of the alcohol being used but can be adjusted to a range from about 25 C to about 120 C with the optional addition of an inert solvent, for example, diethyl ether, methylene chloride, benzene, toluene or xylene. The preferred temperatures are about 35 C to about 80 C, since the thiazolidine ring of the compounds of this invention normally survives at such mild temperatures. As to esterification with alkylhalides, the benzoic acid is treated with a base to form a salt before subsequent treatment with an alkylhalide. The reaction is preferably carried out in a polar, aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide DMF , N,N dimethylacetamide DMAC , dimethylsulfoxide DMSO , or hexamethylphosphoramide HMPA . Other polar solvents may also be used. To minimize elimination, primary alkyl halides preferably methyl iodide or benzyl chloride are usually used and prolonged heating at high temperatures should be avoided. In most cases the reaction is conducted at about 0 100 C preferably at about 10 40 C. For example, the reaction is stirred and maintained at about 25 C until it is substantially complete, usually in about 1 to 48 hrs, preferably about 2 to about 10 hours under optimal conditions. Esterification of the sterically hindered cyclohexyl hydroxyl group is accomplished by treating the product from Step A with an optically active acid generally in the presence of a base and a catalyst. Useful optically active acids, catalysts and bases are described below Fractional recrystallization is used to separate the diastereoisomers from Step B which are exemplified by the formula of the diastereoisomer of Example 1 wherein R is as defined above and R¹ represents the above mentioned optically active acid moieties. Typically, a suitable organic solvent is selected for successive recrystallization until an optically pure diastereoisomer is isolated. The solvents usually include water, acetonitrile, C₁ ₃ alkanol such as methanol or ethanol, acetone, methylacetate, ethylacetate, methylene chloride, ethyl ether, chloroform, dioxane, carbon tetrachloride, toluene, benzene, petroleum ether, n pentane, n hexane, cyclohexane or a mixture thereof. The preferred solvent for the camphanyl or camphorcarbonyl esters of the present invention is methylene chloride, chloroform, ethylacetate or a mixture thereof. Hydrolysis of the highly hindered esters, for example, camphanyl esters, , 3 is difficult. A few representative hydrolysis procedures which are useful are described below The hydrolysis is usually conducted at about 25 C to about 120 C depending on the solvent being used. For example, hydrolysis involving the naked hydroxyl ion KOH crown ether is carried out preferably at about 40 C to about 60 C. The reaction is continued with vigorous agitation until it is substantially complete, usually about 2 to 48 hours, preferably about 5 to about 24 hours. The following example illustrates but does not limit the process of the present invention. The underlined numbers in the example identify the products as shown in the Flow Sheet above. To a freshly prepared solution of 4 3 3 2 1 hydroxycyclohexyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoic acid To a solution of methyl 4 3 3 2 1 hydroxycyclohexyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoate 2 38.37 g, 94.6 mmol in methylene chloride 189 ml are added camphanic acid 20.64 g, 104.1 mmol and 4 dimethylaminopyridine 5.77 g, 47.3 mmol . The resulting solution is cooled to 0 C and treated with a solution of N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide 23.38 g, 113.52 mmol in methylene chloride 180 ml added slowly with stirring over 15 min. Thereby is obtained a heterogeneous mixture which is stirred at ambient temperature for 22 h. The reaction mixture is filtered to remove the insoluble solid N,N dicyclohexylurea .

Thereby is eluted product 3 To toluene 102 ml contained in a 250 ml round bottom flask is added crushed solid potassium hydroxide 3.83 g, 68.3 mmol . The resulting heterogeneous mixture is heated at reflux until The hydrolysis of the pure diastereomer , Using substantially the same procedure as in Example 1 but substituting an equivalent amount of camphorcarboxylic acid for the camphanic acid, the corresponding camphor carbonyl esters are obtained and after separation and hydrolysis, comparable yields of the enantiomers of the azaprostanoic acid are obtained. Substantially the same procedure as described in Example 1 was followed, but the following unresolved compounds were substituted for the racemic combinations used therein 4 3 3 2 1 hydroxycyclohexyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoic acid 4 3 3 2 1 hydroxycyclopentyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoic acid 4 3 3 2 1 hydroxycycloheptyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoic acid 4 3 3 2 1 hydroxy 4,4 dimethylcyclohexyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoic acid 4 3 3 2 9 hydroxy 9 bicyclo 3.3.1 nonyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoic acid 4 4 3 2 1 hydroxycyclohexyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl butyl benzoic acid 4 3 3 3 1 hydroxycyclohexyl propyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoic acid 4 3 3 3 1 hydroxycyclohexyl From the foregoing unresolved compounds, there were obtained the following corresponding enantiomers or 4 3 3 2 1 hydroxycyclohexyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoic acid or 4 3 3 2 1 hydroxycyclopentyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoic acid or 4 3 3 2 1 hydroxycycloheptyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoic acid or 4 3 3 2 1 hydroxy 4,4 dimethylcyclohexyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoic acid or 4 3 3 2 9 hydroxy 9 bicyclo 3.3.1 nonyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoic acid or 4 4 3 2 1 hydroxycyclohexyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl butyl benzoic acid or 4 3 3 3 1 hydroxycyclohexyl propyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinyl propyl benzoic acid or 4 3 3 3 1 hydroxycyclohexyl The composition of the invention can contain varying amounts of i renal vasodilator and ii antihypertensive compounds. The weight ratio of i ii ranges from 1 1 to 25 preferably from 1 1 to 10 more preferably from 1 1 to 15. In addition to the active ingredients of i and ii , the composition contains other conventional pharmaceutically acceptable compounding ingredients. Such ingredients are generally referred to as carriers or diluents. Conventional procedures for preparing such compositions in appropriate dosage forms can be utilized. Whatever the dosage form, it will contain a pharmaceutically effective amount of the present composition. The present compositions can be administered orally or other than orally e.g., parenterally, by insufflation, topically, or rectally using appropriate dosage forms e.g., tablets, capsules, suspensions, or solutions for oral administration or suspensions or emulsions for parenteral administration and ointments for topical administration. Treatment dosage for human beings can be varied as necessary. Generally, daily dosages of the composition of the invention can range from about 550 to about 25 mg preferably, from about 400 to about 60 mg more preferably from about 200 to about 120 mg, using the appropriate dosage form and mode of administration. The composition of this invention inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme and thus blocks conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent pressor substance. Thus blood pressure lowering can result from inhibition of its biosynthesis especially in animals and humans whose hypertension is angiotensin II related. Furthermore, converting enzyme degrades the vasodepressor substance, bradykinin. Therefore, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme may lower blood pressure also by potentiation of bradykinin. Although the relative importance of these and other possible mechanisms remains to be established, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme are effective antihypertensive agents in a variety of animal models and are useful clinically, for example, in many human patients with renovascular, malignant and essential hypertension. See, for example, D. W. Cushman The evaluation of converting enzyme inhibitors is guided by Thus, the compositions of the invention are useful in treating hypertension. They are also of value in the management of acute and chronic congestive heart failure, in the treatment of secondary hyperaldosteronism, primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension, renal failure and renal vascular hypertension, and in the management of vascular disorders such as migraine or Raynaud s disease. The application of the compounds of this invention for these and similar disorders will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The combination composition of the invention was administered to test animals dogs and the results obtained and the methods employed are described in Example 2 below. Each of 6 female beagles was anesthetized and, under sterile conditions, one kidney was wrapped with cellophane. Two weeks later a contralateral nephrectomy was performed so that perinephritic hypertension developed. The surgical preparation of the dogs was completed at least one year prior to the administration of the combination composition of the invention. The dogs were trained to lie quietly on a table during puncture of a femoral artery with a 26 gauge needle attached to a Micron pressure transducer. The output from the transducer was recorded on a 1 channel Gilson strip chart writer. The needle was left in the artery until a clear pulsatile pressure trace of at least 15 seconds duration was obtained. Heart rate was counted and mean arterial pressure MAP was calculated by adding the diastolic pressure to one third of the pulse pressure. Five consecutive daily measurements were made in untreated hypertensive dogs. Subsequent statistical testing of the data by analysis of variance indicated that the blood pressure was constant over the course of the control week an average of the 5 measurements for each dog was therefore used as the control MAP for that animal. During the following week, each dog received a gelatin capsule containing either 1 mg kg of the antihypertensive compound of the invention, 0.2 mg kg of the renal vasodilator compound of the invention or a combination of the 2 compounds at 9 a.m. and at 4 30 p.m. daily for 5 days. Blood pressure was measured immediately before and then 2 hours after the morning treatment. Plasma samples for plasma renin activity PRA determinations were drawn on the first day of the treatment before the first dose the control sample and on the final day of that week 2 hours after the morning dosing. On each occasion, 5 ml of blood was withdrawn from the jugular vein and delivered into a chilled test tube containing ethylenediaminotetraacetate EDTA . Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 4 C and was stored at 20 C until PRA was determined by use of the Clinical Assay Gamma Count ¹²⁵ I radioimmunoassay kit. After each week of compound administration, 2 weeks in which no measurements were made and no treatments were given were allowed to assure that the animals had fully recovered. The protocol of 5 days of control observations and 5 days of treatment was then repeated until each dog had received each treatment once. The data were subjected to analysis of variance for repeated measures. Differences between means were identified by aplication of the Newman Keuls procedure. The results are set forth below in Tables I and II wherein the antihypertensive compound of the invention is identified as A H and the renal vasodilator compound of the invention is identified as RV . The data in Table I reveal that during the first 4 days of concurrent administration of the A H compound and RV compound, MAP was significantly less in the treated dogs than in the untreated beagles. In contrast, administration of either compound alone produced no statistically significant effect on MAP when compared to controls. Statistical comparisons among the effects of the 3 treatments on a given day indicated that the A H compound in combination with the RV compound lowered blood pressure to levels significantly less than those produced by either compound alone during the first 3 days and, on day 4, to a pressure less than the average of the dogs treated with the RV compound alone. Concurrent administration of the A H compound with the RV compound to these mildly hypertensive beagles clearly reduced blood pressure to within the normotensive range, an effect which was not produced with either compound alone. From Table I, it can also be seen that administration of the RV compound alone and in combination with the A H compound significantly increased heart rate above the control levels on the first 3 days of compound administration. The A H compound had no significant effect on pulse rate. The heart rates attained when the RV compound was administered singularly were significantly greater than those measured in dogs treated only with the A H compound on the first 3 days of treatment. When the effects of the combination of the A H and RV compounds were compared to those of A H compound alone, significant differences were found on days 2 and 3 of treatment. As shown in Table II, plasma renin activities PRA were similar at the end of each of the 3 control weeks. As expected all 3 treatments significantly increased PRA above the control levels. There was no significant difference between the renin level attained during treatment with the A H comound and that measured during the RV compound treatment. The effects of the 2 compounds on renin release appeared to be additive since PRA during administration of the combination of the compounds was significantly higher than the activities measured during either treatment alone. From the data shown in Tables I and II, it can be seen that mean arterial pressure MAP was significantly decreased only when the combination of the antihypertensive A H and renal vasodilator RV compounds were administered. It can also be seen that administration of the renal vasodilator compound either alone or in combination with the antihypertensive compound significantly increased heart rate and also elevated plasma renin activities.
