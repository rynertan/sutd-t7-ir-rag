# THERMOPLASTIC COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING A VINYL CHLORIDE POLYMER AND A THERMOPLASTIC BINARY COPOLYMER

## Abstract
A thermoplastic composition made up of an intimate admixture of a a vinyl chloride polymer, and b a thermoplastic copolymer of a vinyl aromatic compound and an imide derivative of an ethylenically unsaturated dicar boxylic acid. The preferred blends contain from 90 to 40 weight percent of a and 10 to 60 weight percent of b .
