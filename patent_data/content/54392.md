# Flame resistant polyester compositions having good colour fastness to light.

## Abstract
Compositions comprising a polyester e.g. a polybuty lene or polyethylene terephthalate, and a flame retardant possess a good colour fastness to light in addition to being flame resistant, and which furthermore do not exude the flame retardant in hot ambient conditions. The compositions may contain in addition ultra violet stabilizers and antioxidants, and compositions which are reinforced with glass fibres have their physical properties further enhanced by the presence of a phenoxy resin.
