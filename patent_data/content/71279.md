The biological activity of several of these compounds was determined. In the beet armyworm test, cotton leaves were dipped in aqueous suspensions of the chemicals, dried, excised and placed into petri dishes with five second instar beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua larvae. Mortality counts were made five days later. The tobacco budworm test was the same except that five tobacco budworm Heliothis virescens larvae were placed onto the treated leaves.

Such additional pesticidal compounds may be insecticides, nematocides, acaricides, herbicides, fungicides or bactericides that are compatible with the compounds of the present invention in the medium selected for application and not antagonistic to the activity of the present compounds.Accordingly, in such embodiments, the pesticidal compound is employed as a supplemental toxicant for the same or for a different pesticidal use, or as an additament. The compounds in combination can generally be present in the ratio of from 1 to 100 parts of the compound of the present invention with from 100 to 1 parts of the additional compound s . The compounds of this invention are, or tend to be, slow acting, i.e., they disrupt the molting of the insect, thereby killing it. As a result, some time can pass before the insects are killed. Accordingly, an increased benefit can be obtained by combining the compounds of this invention with quicker acting insecticides such as, for example, organophosphorus compounds, carbamates and pyrethroids. Because of this different mode of action, the compounds of this invention kill or control insects which have, or may be developing, resistance to the more common insecticides and thus they inhibit or delay the development of resistance to such insecticides. Various modifications may be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope thereof and it is understood that we limit ourselves only as defined in the appended claims.
