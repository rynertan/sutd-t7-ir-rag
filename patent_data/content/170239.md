## Description
VERTICAL ROTARY VALVE The present invention generally relates to a rotary valve adapted to be installed in a line for supply and transfer such as of a powder or granular substance or grain material. More particularly, the invention relates to a rotary valve of a vertical type to be installed in such a line. There are known rotary valves of vertical type adapted to be employed for material supply and transfer in such a line that transfers a powder or granular substance or grain material with a pressure difference thereacross. Such known vertical rotary valves are generally constituted with a stationary valve housing having at the top thereof a material feed port and at the bottom thereof a material discharge port, a rotary drive shaft vertically arranged through the central part of the valve housing, and a rotor housed in the valve housing and fixed on the rotary drive shaft. The rotor includes a plurality of material accommodation chambers each respectively opened upwardly and downwardly and adapted to receive a volume of material, when put in a position where an upper opening thereof is coincident with the material feed port, and discharge same, when put in another position where a lower opening thereof is coincident with the material discharge port. As abovementioned, across such a vertical rotary valve, there is necessarily provided a pressure difference between a line section at the material feed port side of the rotary valve and another line section at the meterial discharge port side thereof. To maintain such a pressure difference, the rotor is needed to be kept airtight against the valve housing. In this respect, even when such a pressure difference is slight, a failure to keep the air tightness between the rotor and the valve housing may cause the material as once received in any material accommodation chamber to partially leak out to an internal chamber of the valve housing or to the material feed port before the discharge through the material discharge port, while such leakage is unfavorable. In the use of such a vertical rotary valve, therefore, it constitutes a prerequisite to keep the airtightness between the rotor and the valve housing, or more particularly, to keep, of such ones of the material accommodation chambers of the rotor as put in positions where the upper or lower opening overlap with neither the material feed port nor the material discharge port of the valve housing, the openings thereof all air tight against the valve housing. As a vertical rotary valve of such known type, there is one disclosed in Japanese Patent Lay Open Print No.52 16769, laid open on February 8, 1977, and another inJapanese Patent Lay Open Print No. 52 123068, laid open on October 15, 1977. The vertical rotary valve disclosed in the formerLay Open Print includes, in a cylindrical valve housing, a cylindrical rotor of a smaller diameter, the rotor having a plurality of material accommodation chambers each respectively opened upwardly and downwardly and fanshaped in the section thereof. Between an upper base portion of the rotor and an upper base portion of the housing is placed an interplate, which is pressed against the rotor with bolts provided at the side of the upper base portion of the housing. Moreover, between the circumferential part as well as the central part of the upper base portion of the rotor and the interplate and between the circumferential part as well as the central part of a lower base portion of the rotor and a lower base portion of the housing are each respectively interposed an abraison resistant ring like seal member. The constitution of the vertical rotary valve by the latter, that is, according to the Japanese PatentLay Open Print No. 52 123068 is, though substantially analogous to, different in some points from that of the vertical rotary valve according to the Japanese PatentLay Open Print No. 52 16769 the difference exemplarily residing in that a valve housing consists of upper and lower halves fitted either in the other and that no interplate is placed between the upper half of the housing and a rotor. In this respect, in the JapanesePatent Lay Open Print No. 52 123068 also, between the upper half of the housing and the rotor is interposed a ring like seal member, while the rotor is pressed by, to be held between, the upper and lower halves of the housing. As will be apparent from the foregoing description, also in either of the vertical rotary valves according to the Japanese Patent Lay Open Print Nos. 52 16769 and 52 123068, a device is imparted to keep, though to a certain degree, the air tightness between the rotor and the valve housing. In both of them, however, the seal member is of a ring like form relatively small in the width, thus being small of the sealing surface area, so that the load pressure per unit area acting on the seal member is large. Therefore, also the abraison of the seal member due to rotation of the rotor is large, thus lowering the durability of the seal member. In addition thereto, the ring like seal member is inherently low in the resistance to pressure and hence, even when an attempt is made to exert a larger pushing force between the upper and lower halves of the valve housing to thereby raise the airtightness, the magnitude of such pushing force is limited in itself. Moreover, although in the vertical rotary valve according to the Japanese Patent Lay Open Print No.52 123068 an O ring for air tight sealing is provided at the fitted part between the upper and lower halves of the valve housing, the sealing effect thereby obtainable is insufficient. In respect of such problems of a seal member as described above, with an object to solve same, still another vertical rotary valve is already proposed byJapanese Patent Lay Open Print No. 55 38254, laid open onMarch 17, 1980. The vertical rotary valve according to this Lay OpenPrint, though substantially analogous in the constitution to that of the vertical rotary valve by the JapanesePatent Lay Open Print No. 52 123068, has a friction plate and a cushion plate combined with each other to be interposed between an upper base portion of a rotor and an upper half portion of a valve housing, as well as between a lower base portion of the rotor and a lower half portion of the valve housing. According to this constitution, in which the friction plate is formed as a seal member to be larger in the sealing surface area than ring like one, the load pressure per unit area acting on the friction plate is reduced. Therefore, also the abraison of the friction plate due to rotation of the rotor is made relatively small, thus raising the durability thereof to some extent. However, due to the reduction in the load pressure per unit area of the friction plate, instead of a rise of the durability thereof, also the air tightness is reduced between the friction plate as placed above or below the rotor and an upper or lower opening of each material accommodation chamber of the rotor, respectively. This is because the rotor is pushed to be held, through upper and lower combinations of the friction and cushion plates, by and between the upper and lower half portions themselves of the valve housing. Further, also in the vertical rotary valve according to the Japanese Patent Lay Open Print No. 55 38254, such a conventional problem is left intact as concerned with the sealing to be air tight between the upper and lower half portions of the valve housing. Furthermore, in all of three vertical rotary valves according to the aforementioned Japanese Patent Lay OpenPrints, the rotor is shaped in a cylindrical form and has plural material accommodation chambers of a fan like section. Accordingly, also the material feed port as well as the material discharge port is shaped in a sectorial form in the section thereof, which is unfavorable as an aperture configuration of a valve adapted to be installed in a material transfer line, there being the fear that material streams may be unevenly distributed in the section. Still more, in order to define the material accommodation chambers in such a form as above mentioned, the rotor is necessarily provided with a plurality of rectangular plates radially extending from the central part thereof through which the rotary drive shaft is provided. In this respect, concerning the sealing to be airtight between the valve housing and the upper and lower ends of each of the rectangular plates, no consideration ne is provided in the Japanese Patent Lay Open Print Nos.52 16769 and 52 123068. In the Japanese Patent Lay OpenPrint No. 55 38254, though provided with a certain consideration, the sealing between the valve housing and the rectangular plates is insufficient in the air tightness because of the reduced load pressure per unit area acting on the friction plate between the rotor and the housing. Yet more, not limitting to the aforementioned three vertical rotary valves, in any known rotary valve of the vertical type, respective material accommodation chambers of the rotor are adapted to let the material, as it is once received therein, drop by its own weight from the material discharge port of the valve housing into a line section at the discharge side. As a result, depending on the inner pressure of the discharge side line section, the material may be impeded in the falling from the material accommodation chambers of the rotor into the discharge side line section. The present invention has been achieved to effectively overcome such various problems of conventional vertical rotary valves. According to the present invention, there is provided a vertical rotary valve 1 comprising a valve housing 2 with an interior chamber 28 defined therein, the valve housing 2 having in an upper portion 21 thereof a material feed port 3 and in a lower portion 22 thereof a material discharge port 6 different in the horizontal position from the material feed port 3 , a rotary drive shaft 5 vertically arranged through the central part of the valve housing 2 and adapted to be air tight thereto, a rotor 4 fixed on the drive shaft 5 within the interior chamber 28 of the valve housing 2 , the rotor 4 containing at least one material accommodation chamber 35, 38 having an upper opening 36 adapted to receive at a first position a of the material accommodation chamber 35, 38 a volume of material from the material feed port 3 and a lower opening 37 adapted to discharge at a second position b of the material accommodation chamber 35, 38 the material into the material discharge port 6 , a platelike upper seal member 7 interposed between the upper portion 21 of the valve housing 2 and an upper portion 33 of the rotor 4 , the upper seal member 7 having a communication hole 58 for adapting the upper opening 36 of the material accommodation chamber 35, 38 as located at the first position a thereof to communicate with the material feed port 3 , a plate like lower seal member 8 interposed between the lower portion 22 of the valve housing 2 and a lower portion 34 of the rotor 4 , the lower seal member 8 having a communication hole 53 for adapting the lower opening 37 of the material accommodation chamber 35, 38 as located at the second position b thereof to communicate with the material discharge port 6 , and a pushing means 9 for pushing the upper seal member 7 in the axial direction of the rotor 4 onto the rotor 4 . Moreover, according to the present invention, there is provided a vertical rotary valve 1 comprising a valve housing 2 with an interior chamber 28 defined therein, the valve housing 2 having in an upper portion 21 thereof a material feed port 3 and in a lower portion 22 thereof a material discharge port 6 different in the horizontal position from the material feed port 3 , a rotary drive shaft 5 vertically arranged through the central part of the valve housing 2 and adapted to be air tight thereto, a rotor 4 fixed on the drive shaft 5 within the interior chamber 28 of the valve housing 2 , the rotor 4 containing at least one material accommodation chamber 35, 38 having an upper opening 36 adapted to receive at a first position a of the material accommodation chamber 35, 38 a volume of material from the material feed port 3 and a lower opening 37 adapted to discharge at a second position b of the material accommodation chamber 35, 38 the material into the material discharge port 6 , and the valve housing t2 further having a medium inlet port 103 adapted for letting into the material accommodation chamber 35, 38 a medium to force the material of the material accommodation chamber 35, 38 as located at the second position b thereof to discharge into the material discharge port 6 . Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a vertical rotary valve which is permitted with a simple constitution to achieve an increased degree of air tight sealability between a valve housing and a valve rotor, while raising the durability of a seal member interposed for the sealing therebetween. Another object of the present invention is to provide a vertical rotary valve in which a volume of material in a material accommodation chamber of a valve rotor is permitted to be firmly discharged into a material discharge port. The above and further features, objects and advantages of the present invention will more fully appear from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the invention when same is read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Referring first to Fig. 1, designated at reference numeral 1 is a vertical rotary valve according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the rotary valve 1 comprising a cylindrical valve housing 2 and a rotor 4 arranged in the housing 2. The valve housing 2 comprises a cylindrical body 20, and an upper cover 21 and a lower cover 22 covering the body 20 from above and below, respectively. The body 20 has at the upper and lower ends thereof, along the circumferences thereof, upper and lower flange portions 23, 24 radially outwardly projected therefrom, respectively, which flange portions 23, 24 are fastened to the circumferential parts of the upper and lower covers 21, 22, with gaskets 25, 26 put therebetween, respectively, by means of bolts 27 and nuts, so that a fully enclosed interior chamber 28 is defined in the housing 2. The upper cover 21 has in a part near the circumference thereof an opening 30 formed therethrough for vertically fitting therein a tubular member 29 which defines a material feed port 3. Around the opening 30, the upper cover 21 is formed with an annular projection 31 standing thereon as a stuffing box, and for the air tightness to be kept between the tubular member 29 and the opening 30 there is interposed a packing assembly 32 consisting of a gland packing and a packing gland. In the interior chamber 28 of the valve housing 2 is provided a rotor 4 as a valve body, which rotor 4 comprises upper and lower disc like base plates 33, 34, and a plurality of six in this embodiment tubular bodies 35 vertically arranged therebetween in an equiangularly spacing manner and located radially near to the circumference of the rotor 4. The upper and lower base plates 33, 34 have formed therethrough a set of upper openings 36 and a set of lower openings 37, respectively, the openings 36, 37 being the same in the number as the tubular bodies 35, respectively, and communicating each respectively with the interior of one of the tubular bodies 35, so that a number of material accommodation chambers 38 same as the tubular bodies 35 are given each respectively by the combination of the interior of one of the tubular bodies 35 and corresponding ones of the openings 36, 37.The rotor 4 is fixed, by means of a tubular holder 39 and a key 40, on a drive shaft 5 vertically arranged so as to stretch through the respective central parts of the upper and lower base plates 33, 34, or more particularly, as to extend, outwardly of the upper and lower base plates 33, 34, passing respective through holes 41, 42 formed in the central parts of the base plates 33, 34. Incidentally, in Fig. 1, designated at reference numeral 43, 44 are upper and lower packing assemblyies for sealing the drive shaft 5 in an air tight manner at the through holes 41, 42, the packing assemblies 43, 44 each respectively consisting of a gland packing and a pakcing gland. The drive shaft 5 is operatively connected for the rotational driving thereof, through an unshown upper end portion thereof, to a motor 15, as later described, and is rotatably supported at a lower end portion 45 thereof through a bearing 47 by a lower cross stay 46 provided on the lower cover 22 of the valve housing 2 and at a middle part 49 of the upper extension thereof through another bearing 50 by an upper cross stay 48 provided on the upper cover 21 of the housing 2. By the shaft 5 with such arrangement, the rotor 4 is adapted to be driven to rotate in the housing 2. The tubular bodies 35 are arranged as shown in Fig.5, that is, so disposed with respect to the axis 01 of the drive shaft 5 as to have the axes 02 thereof radially displaced to be located at a distance n therefrom and circumferentialwise spaced apart at intervals of an angle 61. In this respect, in this embodiment in which the tubular bodies 35 are six in the number, the angle 61 is equal to 600. In other words, the tubular bodies 35 are arranged, radially, equi distantly and, circumferen tially, equi angularly spacedly with respect to the drive shaft 5. The lower cover 22 has in a part near the circumference thereof an opening 51 formed therethrough, around which the downside of the cover 22 is downwardly projected to provide a tubular extension 52 defining therein a material discharge port 6. The material discharge port 6 is located at an angularly displaced position from the material feed port 3 with respect to the drive shaft 5 or, in this embodiment, at a position of 1800 from the port 3 about the shaft 5. Namely, the material discharge port 6 is intentionally displaced to be different in the horizontal position from the material feed port 3. In this respect, the longitudinal sectional view shown in Fig. 1 is given, for the conveniency of explanation, as the combination of a quarter cutaway section of such a part of the vertical rotary valve 1 that is found above the upper base plate 33 of the rotor 4 and a halfcutaway section of the remaining part thereof. In this embodiment, in which the material feed port 3 and the material discharge port 6 are angularly displaced at 1800 from each other with respect to the drive shaft 5, when any of the tubular bodies 35 has the material accommodation chamber 38 thereof brought into a position a thereof coincident with the material feed port 3, the material accommodation chamber 38 of that one of the tubular bodies 35 which is disposed at the opposite side to that tubular body 35 with respect to the shaft 5 is located at a position b thereof coincident with the material discharge port 6. As a matter of course, none of the tubular bodies 35 is adapted to have the material accommodation chamber 38 thereof so located as to simultaneously communicate with both the material feed and discharge ports 3, 6. The material feed port 3 and the material discharge port 6 as well as the material accommodation chambers 38 are all shaped circular in the section thereof, such that relative to the inside diameter rl of the feed port 3 that r2 of each accommodation chamber 38 is substantially equal as well as to that r3 of the discharge port 6.Moreover, the feed and discharge ports 3, 6 have the axes thereof disposed each respectively at the distance 1 from the axis 01 of the drive shaft 5, so that each time when any of the tubular bodies 35 is carried into the position a or b, the axis 02 of the accommodation chamber 38 in this tubular body 35 becomes substantially coincident with the axis of the feed port 3 or that of the discharge port 6, respectively. On the upside of the upper base plate 33 of the rotor 4 and on the downside of the lower base plate 34 thereof, there are provided upper and lower circular seal plates 7 and 8, respectively. The lower seal plate 8 is placed on the lower cover 22 of the valve housing 2 and kept in slidable contact at the upside thereof with the downside of the lower base plate 34 of the rotor 4 which is pressed thereagainst with a controllable force. In the lower seal plate 8, at a part thereof corresponding to the material discharge port 6 is formed a communication hole 53 for passing the material to be discharged and at the central part thereof is opened a through hole 54 for inserting the drive shfat 5. Incidentally, in Fig. 1, designated at reference numeral 55 a rotation checking stopper for fixing the lower seal plate 8 to the lower cover 22 of the valve housing 2 in a level adjustable manner. Moreover, in the lower base plate 8, there is opened a gas vent hole 56 at a position angularly displaced to be phase delayed, with respect to the rotation of the rotor 4, from the communication hole 53 communicating with the material discharge port 6 for example, in such a part of the base plate 8 as projected toward an observer in front of Fig. 1 when supposing that the direction of rotation of the rotor 4 as operated should be clockwise for another observer viewing from above thereof. In other words, as seen from Fig. 4, the gas vent hole 56 of the lower seal plate 8 is provided at a point thereon where, any crime when one of the tubular bodies 35 has the material accommodation chamber 38 thereof put in communication with the material discharge port 6, the vent hole 56 is kept from communicating with this accommodation chamber 38.In this embodiment, the gas vent hole 56 is located at a point circumferentially displaced to be phase delayed, from the material discharge port 6, at an angle of 900 about the drive shaft 5. Further, at a position coincident with the gas vent hole 56, the lower seal plate 8 is provided with a gas vent tube 57 communicating with the atmosphere. Accordingly, when fixing an eye upon one of the tubular bodies 35, the material accommodation chamber 38 thereof is adapted to experience the following steps as the rotor 4 is driven to rotate it first receives a volume of material through the material feed port 3 and, thereafter, discharges the material into the material discharge port 6, when it is to have a volume. of gases relatively high of the pressure introduced to be filled therein from the discharge port side line section, which gases however will be effectively vented through the gas vent hole 56 and the gas vent tube 57 to the atmosphere. In this respect, when the tubular body 35 has come around in position to again receive a volume of material with the material accommodation chamber 38 thereof, if a part of the high pressure gases from the discharge port side line section is left therein, such residual highpressure gases may reversely inflow into the feed port side line section, adversely affecting the inherent flow of material. As will be apparent, to the case where the pressure in the discharge port side line section is not so high, the vertical rotary valve 1 according to the present invention may be applied in a form having neither the gas vent hole 56 nor the gas vent tube 57. On the other hand, the upper seal plate 7, which is placed on the upside of the upper base plate 33 of the rotor 4, has formed in a part thereof a communication hole 58 communicating with the material feed port 3, at which part the seal plate 7 is fastened to a lower flange portion 59 of the tubular member 29, whereas this member 29 is axially slidably fitted in the opening 30 of the upper cover 21 of the valve housing 2 so as to be airtight thereagainst by the packing assembly 32 as aforementioned. Moreover, in the central part of the upper seal plate 7, there is formed a through hole 60 for inserting there through the drive shaft 5. In the upside surface of the upper seal plate 7, a pair of later described areas are each respectively downwardly pushed from above with one of a pair of pushing mechanisms 9. Each pushing mechanism 9 comprises a cylindrical holder 61 formed as an integal stuffing box on the upside of the upper cover 21 of the valve housing 2, a packing assembly consisting of a gland packing 62 fitted into depth of the holder 61 and a packing gland 63 screwed in the holder 61 so Åa to exert from above a variable pressure onto the packing 62, and an adjust screw 66 fitted through the packing assembly and brought into abutment at the lower end part 65 thereof with corresponding one of the aforesaid upside surface areas of the upper seal plate 7.In each of those surface areas, the upper seal plate 7 has a recessed portion 67 adapted to be engaged with the lower end part 65 of the adjust screw 66, so that, by proper thread driving to let down, this screw 66 is permitted to exert an adjustable pressure onto the seal plate 7, thereby controlling the sealing pressure between the upper seal plate 7 and the upper base plate 33 cf the rotor 4 and that between the lower seal plate 8 cnd the lower base plate 34 of the rotor 4.In this respect, to render uniform the selaing pressure over the seal plates 7, 8, a plurality of such pushing mechanisnmay preferably pro vided, whereas this embodiment comprises the paired pushing mechanisms 9 arranged in positions angularly spaced apart from each other at an angle of 1800 about the drive shaft 5, as shown in Fig. 2. Incidentally, the engagement relation between the adjust screw 66 and the recessed portion 67 is effectively utilized not only for the exertion of pressure but also to check the seal plate 7 against undesired rotation thereof. The upper and lower seal plates 7, 8 are made of a sintered metal, while they may be of a hard material such as a ceramic or else of a soft synthetic resin material such as a teflon. In this respect, as shown in Fig. 7, in a partially modified example for an application in which a soft seal plate 7a is desired, there may preferably provided a back up member 7b made of a metal sheet. Incidentally, in Fig. 7, designated at reference character 7c is an anti rotation stopper, and 67a is a recessed portion adapted to be engaged with the lower end part 65 of the adjust screw 66. There will be described hereinbelow the function of the vertical rotary valve 1. First, a volume of material is sent to the material feed port 3, where it is received by one of the material accommodation chambers 38 when this accommodation chamber 38 is brought with the rotation of the rotor 4 into the position a right below the feed port 3, whereas with further rotation of the rotor 4 the accommodation chamber 38 is to occupy those positions displaced relative to the communication hole 58 of the upper seal plate 7 as well as to the feed port 3, at which the chamber 38 is kept sealed up by the upper and lower seal plates 7, 8 with a controllable sealing pressure exerted thereon by the pushing mechanisms 9.During such phase of rotation, the upper and lower base plates 33, 34 of the rotor 4 are pressed in a sandwiched manner from above and below by the upper and lower plates 7, 8, which are of a plate like form, so that there are produced sufficient pushing forces due to surface ranging pressures, in addition to that the surface contact assures high air tightness.With still further rotation of the rotor 4, the accommodation chamber 38 reaches the position b, where it communicates with the material discharge port 6 and discharges the material thereinto. After the discharge of material, with yet further rotation of the rotor 4, the accommodation chamber 38 becomes conincident with the gas vent hole 56 and the gas vent tube 57, through which the gases in the chamber 38 are to be vented, thus permitting the next reception of material to be smoothly performed. The foregoing steps will be repeated. Incidentally, in this embodiment of the invention, there is employed a medium circulation system as follows. In Fig. 1, designated at reference numeral 10 is a medium inlet opened through a part of the peripheral wall of the housing body 20, and 11 is a medium outlet formed in a part of the lower cover 22 of the valve housing 2.The inlet 10 and the outlet 11 are adapted to communicate with the outside through medium feed and discharge pipes 69, 71 provided with stop valves 68, 70, respectively, to thereby permit a medium to circulate through the interior chamber 28 of the valve housing 2. The medium may advantageously be selected in accordance with the system of process or the like in a subsequent step exemplarily, cooling water may be fed into the interior chamber 28 to cool the respective tubular bodies 35 in such a case that the material in use is likely to adhere to the inside wall of each accommodation chambers 38. Further, in the case where the material experiences a heating process in the subsequent step, a hot medium such as steam, hot water, or the like may preferably be fed into the interior chamber 28 to preheat the contents of the tubular bodies 35. Furthermore, in the case of a pressure exerting process, a medium of a higher pressure than the pressure of the process may be fed into the interior chamber 28, to thereby effectively permit the prevention even against small leakage of the material from a certain sealing point. Moreover, in this embodiment of the invention, as the time of use of the vertical rotary valve 1 becomes longer, the downside of the upper seal plate 7 as well as the upside of the lower seal member 8 may be worn.However, for the upper and lower seal plates 7, 8, which are put in surface contact with the upper and lower base plates 33, 34 of the rotor 4 respectively, such abraison will be uniform. Therefore, in the use of the rotary valve 1, the sealedness of the respective material accommodation chambers 38 of the rotor 4 is permitted to be easily kept against the interior chamber 28 of the valve housing 2, by no more than adjusting respective pushing forces of the adjust screws 66 of the pushing mechanisms 9 from time to time. Incidentally, Fig. 6 is an exploded view of a section, as viewed from inside, of such a part of the vertical rotary valve 1 including the material feed port 3, the material discharge port 6, the upper and lower seal plates 7, 8, and the rotor 4, as cut along a cylindrical plane vertically extending at the horizontal distance 1 from the the axis 01 of the drive shaft 5. There will be described hereinbelow various modified examples of the pushing mechanisms 9 for the upper seal plate 7. Fig. 8 shows an example in which a hydraulic power cylinder is used as a drive source of pushing mechanism.Instead of the adjust screw 66 provided through the gland packing 62 and the packing gland 63, a rod 68 is adapted to be brought into abutment as well as engagement with the upper seal plate 7, so that pressures are exerted on the seal plate 7 by letting down the rod 68 with the supply of hydrualic oil to a power cylinder 70 held by a support member 69. In this example, to keep constant the pressure acting on a sealing surface 7d, the cylinder 70 is controlled by detecting a load current of the motor which is variable depending on that pressure.More particularly, the motor 15 adapted for driving the drive shaft 5 into rotation has the load current thereof detected with a current meter 71 , of which output signal is input into a controller 72 adapted to provide a servo valve 73 with a command in accordance the signal from the current meter 71 , to control the travel of the cylinder 70, thereby adjusting the pressure acting on the sealing surface 7d. Further, in this example, for an increased control accuracy, a pressure sensor 74 adapted to detect the pressure that the rod 68 exerts on the seal plate 7 is provided in a region of the seal plate 7 at which the rod 68 abut on the plate 7, to thereby control the pressure of the cylinder 70. In this respect, a pressure sensor may be provided on the sealing surface 7d to detect the pressure acting thereon.Or otherwise, a medium from the sealing surface 7d, for example a leaked quantity such as of water vapor, may be detected to thereby control the cylinder 70. Figs. 9 and 10 show examples of a vibration absorbing mechanism for the vertical rotary valve 1, respectively. In the example of Fig.9, a number of conical plate springs 75 are interposed between the lower seal plate 8 and the lower cover 22. The seal plate 8 is formed at the downside thereof with a downwardly opening recess 76, and the lower cover 22, at the upside thereof with an upward projection 77 loose fittable into the recess 76, whereby the horizontal relative movement of the seal plate 8 with respect to the lower cover 22 is restricted, while the vertical gap therebetween is permitted in a resiliently guided manner by the springs 75 which are fitted on the projection 77. The projection 77 has the axis 03 thereof disposed at the distance 21 from the axis 01 of the drive shaft 5. In the example of Fig. 10, a coiled spring 78 is interposed between the lowest end of the lower end part 65 of the adjust screw 66 and a bottom surface 67a of the recessed portion 67 of the upper seal plate 7, whereas the depth dimension of the recessed portion 67 is made larger than the case of Fig. 1 to thereby prevent the lower end part 65 of the adjust screw 66 from coming out of the recessed portion 67. According to the examples of Figs. 9 and 10, vertical vibrations of the rotor 4 during operation of the rotary valve 1 can be effectively absorbed. Fig. 11 shows a practical example of application of the vertical rotary valve according to the present invention, in which the rotary valve 1 is used as a material feed device 13 on one hand and as a material discharge device 16 on the other hand in a plant for a heating treatment under pressure. In Fig. 11, designted at reference numeral 12 is a smothering tank for heating under pressure a material such as for example a soybean by use of saturated steam.The material feed device 13 comprises the vertical rotary valve 1 as above mentioned. The material feed port 3 is located below the discharge end of a material feeder 14 and the material discharge port 6 is connected to an inlet part 80 of the smothering tank 12, thus air tightly feeding the smothering tank 12 with the material through the rotary valve 1, while the interior chamber 28 of the valve housing has hot steam circulated through the feed and discharge pipes 69, 71 to preheat the material to be fed into the smothering tank 12. Designated at reference numeral 15 is a motor for driving the rotor 4, which motor 15 is operatively connected through a chain and sprocket drive 81 to the drive shaft 5. The material as treated by heating under pressure in the smothering tank 12 is transfered to the material discharge device 16, from which it is discharged to be sent as required.Also the discharge device 16 comprises the vertical rotary valve 1 as already described. An outlet part 82 of the smothering tank 12 is connected to the material feed port 3 of the discharge device 16, so that the material is received therefrom and discharged as a produced through the material discharge port 6 of the discharge device 16.As will be understood, at the material discharge device 16 comprising the rotary valve 1, those high temperature, high pressure gases sent in the material accommodation chambers 38 together with the treated materials from the outlet part 82 of the smothering tank 12 are to be discharged through the material discharge port 6 when the material is discharged therethrough. Therefore, for the rotary valve 1 used as the material discharge device 16, the gas vent valve 56 and the gas vent tube 57 are not always needed. As will be understood from the foregoing description, in the vertical rotary valve 1 according to the present invention, those seal members 7, 8 provided for sealing the rotor 4 from the interior chamber 28 of the valve housing 2 have a plate like form, so that the sealing surface area of each of them is made larger than that of corresponding one of ring like seal members used in a conventional vertical rotary valve, thus resulting in decrease in the abraison and rise of the durability, while permitting the seal members 7, 8 to be pushed against the rotor 4 with stronger forces, thus effectively raising the sealability. Moreover, in the vertical rotary valve 1, the pushing mechanisms 9 for fixing the seal members 7, 8 while pushing them against the rotor 4 are adapted to push the seal plates 7, 8 and particularly to push the upper seal plate 7 against the upper base plate 33 of the rotor 4 at positions circumferentially coincident with the material accommodation chambers 38, irrespective of a sealing mechanism consisting of the gaskets 25, 26 and the bolts 27 between principal constituent members such as the body 20 and the upper and lower covers 21, 22 of the valve housing 2. Therefore, the load pressure per unit area acting on the upper seal plate 7 at such positions can be raised, as necessary, and hence the sealing of the accommodation chambers 38 of the rotor 4 is permitted, against the interior chamber 28 of the valve housing 2, to be uniformly and more firmly effected. Particularly, the rotary valve 1, in which the seal members 7, 8 are of a flat plate form, permits the precision of machining to be easily raised, while simplifying also the fixing structure of the seal members 7, 8, thus effectively contributing to the structutral simplification as well as cost reduction of the whole part of the vertical rotary valve. Further, in the rotary valve 1 which includes the gaskets 25, 26 relatively large of the sealing surface area, also the sealedness of the interior chamber 28 itself of the valve housing 2 is increased when comparing with a conventional vertical rotary valve including a valve housing composed of upper and lower halves. Furthermore, in the rotary valve 1, each of the material accommodation chambers 38 in the rotor 4 is shaped in a circular form in the section, with the inside diameter r2 substantially equal to those rl, r3 of the material feed and discharge ports 3, 6, so that the flow of material is made uniform in the feed into the accommodation chamber 38 as well as in the discharge therefrom, thus permitting the material feeding and discharging functions as inherent valve functions to be smoothly achieved. In addition thereto, when compared with a conventional vertical rotary valve including a plurality of material accommodation chambers shaped in a sectorial form in the section, in the rotary valve 1 the material is unlikely to adhere to the inside wall of the respective material accommodation chambers 38. Still more, in the rotary valve 1 in which the plural tubular bodies 35 defining the material accommodation chambers 38 are angularly spaced apart from each other and all interposed between the upper and lower base plates 33, 34 of the rotor 4, it is permitted to provide a medium circulation system consisting of the medium inlet 10 and outlet 11, the medium feed and discharge pipes 69, 71, and the stop valves 68, 70 , whereas the provision of such system is substantially impossible or useless in a conventional vertical rotary valve in which a plurality of material accommodation chambers of a sectorial form in the section are provided by dividing the interior of a single cylindrical rotor. Incidentally, in the foregoing embodiment, the material in any of the material accommodation chambers 38 of the rotor 4 is caused to drop into the material discharge port 6 by the own weight thereof, that is, the material discharge from the rotary valve 1 is spotaneously effected taking the advantage of the gravity. In this respect, in Fig. 12, there is given a longitudinal sectional view of a vertical rotary valve 100 according to a modified example of the present invention.in which a volume of material as once received in any of plural material accommodation chambers 38 of a rotor 4 is forcibly let to discharge into a material discharge port 6 by means of a heating medium which is same as that used in a material treatment plant installed at the discharge side of the valve 100. Incidentally, in this modified example, the basic structural arrangement and fundamental functions are analogous to those of the vertical rotary valve 1, excepting a below described heating medium supply system, so that like parts are designated by like reference numerals, while eliminating redundant description thereof. In the vertical rotary valve 100, an upper cover 21 of a valve housing 2 has formed therethrough an opening 101, of which axis is coincident with that of the material discharge port 6. Around the opening 101, the upside of the upper cover 21 is formed with an annular projection 102 standing thereon as a stuffing box. In the opening 101 is fitted a tubular member 104 which defines therein a heating medium inlet port 103 with an inside diameter r4 equal to that r3 of the material discharge port 6. The clearance between the opening 101 and the tubular member 104 is sealed in an air tight manner with a packing assembly fitted in the annular projection 102, the packing assembly consisting of a gland packing 106 and a flange headed packing gland 107 fixed to the annular projection 102 by means of bolts 105.The axis of the heating medium inlet port 103 is disposed at a distance all from the axis of a drive shaft 5, similarly to that of a material feed port 3. The tubular member 104 has a lower flanged portion 108 air tightly fastened to the upside of an upper seal plate 7, which plate 7 also is formed therethrough with a circular communication hole 109 coaxial with and substantially equal in the cross sectional area to the heating medium inlet port 103. The communication hole 109 is provided for the purpose of adapting the heating medium inlet port 103 to communicate with that one of the material accommodation chambers 38 which is then put in communication with the material discharge port 6, to send a heating medium into this accommodation chamber 38, thereby forcibly letting the material of the accommodation chamber 38 to discharge into the discharge port 6.The tubular member 104, fitted in the opening 101 of the upper cover 21 through the gland pakcing 106 and the packing gland 107, is adapted to be slidable relative to the packing assembly in the axial direction of the drive shaft 5, that is, in the vertical direction. Figs. 13 and 14 are top and bottom views of the vertical rotary valve 100 of Fig. 12, respectively. As aforementioned, the structural arrangement of the rotary valve 100 is analogous to that of the rotary valve 1, excepting the heating medium supply system consisting of the annular projection 102, the heating medium inlet port 103, the tubular member 104, the fixing bolts 105, the gland packing 106, and the packing gland 107. Thus, there are provided a pair of upper seal late pushing mechanisms 9 arranged symmetrical to each other with respect to the drive shaft 5, and a gas vent tube 57 is provided on the downside of a lower cover 22. The heating medium to be inlet from the heating medium inlet port 103 is made of high temperature, highpressure gases in use in the material treatment plant for treating the material discharged from the material discharge port 6 of the rotary valve 100. In this respct, a detailed description will follow, including an explanation of the system with which such heating medium is supplied to the inlet port 103. Fig. 15 shows an example of application in which the vertical rotary valve 100 is employed in heating equipment 200 of a flash type. The flash type heating equipment 200 comprises a heating pipe 209 adapted to have conducted there through a flow of superheated steam for flashingly carrying while being mixed with a material and for concurrently performing a heating treatment thereof, a cyclone 203 for separating the heat treated mixture into the material and the superheated steam, a product discharge valve 208 provided at a discharge port 203a of the cyclone 203 and adapted to discharge the treated material out of system in an air tight manner, a circulation blower 205 for circulating the superheated steam, a superheater 207 for heating the superheated steam as lowered of the temperature through the mixing with the material, and the vertical rotary valve 100 employed as a feeding device of the material The heating pipe 209 is connected at the upstream end thereof to the material discharge port 6 of the rotary valve 100 and at the downstream end thereof to an entrance port 202 of the cyclone 203. Moreover, an outlet 204 of the cyclone 202 is connected to the suction port of the circulation blower 205 through a steam line 210, and the delivery port of the blower 205, via the superheater 207 to the heating medium inlet port of the rotary valve 100 through steam lines .211, 212, whereby a circulation system 201 is constituted. In Fig. 15, designated at reference numeral 213 is a saturated steam supply line for supplying the circulation system 201 with saturated system, the supply line 213 being connected to the steam line 211. In the flash type heating equipment 200 of such constitution as described above, the material as fed from the feeder 14 through the material feed port 3 into the vertical rotary valve 100 is to be discharged, when the rotor 4 in Fig. 12 is rotated by one half turn or at 1800, from the material discharge port 6 by the own weight thereof or the flashing of superheated steam.Then, being carried while heat treated by the flashing superheated steam in the heating pipe 209, the material enters the cyclone 203, where it is separated from the superheated steam, to be discharged to be collected as a product through the product discharge valve 208, while the superheated steam is forced by the circulation blower 205 into circulation through the circulation system 201. Fig. 16 shows a partially modified example of the heating medium inlet port 103. The inlet port 103 has coaxially arranged in the way thereof a baffle member 310 for reducing the sectional area of medium flow path, the baffle member 310 comprising a cylindrical body part 312, a conical head part 311, and a pair of support plates 313 for interconnecting the cylindrical part 312 with the inside wall of the tubular member 104. According to such constitution, a flow of the heating medium introduced to the inlet port 103 has the speed thereof increased by the baffle member 310, before entering one of the material accommodation chambers 38, thus permitting the material in this accommodation chamber 38 to be further effectively discharged. Moreover, the heating meadium with increased flow speed is fed into the accommodation chamber 38 along the inside wall of the tubular body 35, thus further assuring the discharge of material, particularly flashing out the residual material sticking to the inside wall of the tubular body 35. Fig. 17 shows another partially modified example of the heating medium inlet port 103. The inlet port 103 has disposed in the way thereof a swirling blade member 410 for generating swirling streams. The blade member 410 comprises a small diameter cylindrical part 413 coaxially arranged with respect to the inlet port 103, and four skewed blades 414 for interconnecting the cylindrical part 413 with the inside wall of the cylindrical member 104, the blades 414 being equiangularly spaced apart at circumferential intervals of 90 about the cylindrical part 413 and inclined at a predetermined angle. The cylindrical part 413 is conically shaped at the upper and lower end thereof to provide upper and lower conical portions 411, 412, respectively. According to such constitution, a flow of the heating medium introduced to the inlet port 103 is tangentially deflected to generate swirling streams, before entering one of the accommodation chambers 38, thus further promoting the material discharge from this accommodation chamber 38. Incidentally, instead of the foregoing embodiment in which the material accommodation chambers 38 of the rotor 4 have the axes thereof vertically arranged, the present invention may be so embodied as to have the axes of material accommodation chambers all inclined at a predetermined angle. Moreover, not limitting to the foregoing embodiment, the location in the upper cover 21 as well as the number of the pushing mechanisms 9 may be arbitrarily determined, as circumstances require, providing that the upper and lower seal plates 7, 8 are adequately pushed against the rotor 4. Although there has been described what is at present considered to be the preferred embodiment of the inven tion, it will be understood that the present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof.The present embodiment is therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrective. The scope of the invention is indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description.
