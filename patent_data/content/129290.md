# Alkali treated lecithin in fats.

## Abstract
Cooking fat compositions containing lecithin which resist excessive thermal darkening are disclosed. Methods for stabilizing lecithin to prevent excessive darkening in a heated cooking fat require treatment of the lecithin, or the cooking fat containing it, with a strongly basic compound. The lecithin can then be added to the fat at a higher level to improve the anti sticking performance of the fat.
