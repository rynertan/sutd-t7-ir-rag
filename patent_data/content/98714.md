# FUNCTION GENERATORS

## Abstract
A function generator produces an output signal f X vary ing in predetermined non linear relationship to an input signal X . The input signal X addresses a programmable read only memory 14 which is programmed to produce readout signals 1, 2 linearly proportional to selected values of the input signal X and readout signals 3, 4 corresponding to the predeter mined non linear function of the input signal at the selected values. The output signal X is derived by interpolation be tween consecutive selected input signals which bracket the in put signal.
