# ELEVATOR BRAKE AND SAFETY

## Abstract
Two hydraulically controlled brakes 32 are attached to an elevator car 10 and each engages a guide rail 18 . Each brake 32 is applied by a spring 40 . The spring is compressed to release the brake, by actuating hydraulic cylinders 31a through an electromechanically operated master cylinder 31 that responds to a signal from the motor control 16 . An electromechanical release valve 52 is operated by a govenor 22 , when an overspeed condition exists to quickly release the pressure in the cylinders, applying the brake.
