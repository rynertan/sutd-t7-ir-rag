## Description
TITL OF THE INVENTION Use of LIPOXYGENASE INHIBITORS for the preparation of CYTOPROTECTIVE pharmaceutical compositions and process for the preparation of a cytoprotective pharmaceutical composition.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention concerns the use of LIPOXYGENASE INHIBITORS for the preparation of cytoprotective pharmaceutical compositions which contain ascytoprotective active component at least one lipoxygenase inhibitor. The present invention, furthermore, concerns a process for the preparation of a cytoprotective pharmaceutical composition which contains as cytoprotective active component at least one lipoxygenase inhibitor. The cytoprotective pharmaceutical compositioie which are produced according to the inventive use of at least lipoxygenase inhibitor or which are produced according to the inventive process by incorporating into said cytoprotective compositions as cytoprotective active component at least one lipoxygenase inhibitor, can be administered to a mammal, specially to man, for inducing cytoprotection. The pharmaceutical compositions accordingly are useful as inhibitors of mammalian leukotriene biosynthesis. The lipoxygenase inhibitors which are used according to the present invention are prior art pharmaceutically active ingredients which wore used in corresponding pharmaceutical compositions for treating allergic conditions, asthma, cardiova cular disorders, and inflammations. Prior to this invention, there was no evidence in the literature that the lipoxygenase inhibitors were cytoprotective.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention concerns the use of lipoxygenase inhibitors for the preparation of cytoprotective pharmaceutical compositions which contain sscytoprotective active component at least one lipoxygenase inhibitor. The present invention, furthermore, concerns a process for the preparation of a cytoprotective pharmaceutical composition in which there is used as cytoprotective active component at least one lipoxygenase inhibitor. Preferred lipoxygenase inhibitors which are used according to the present invention are the compounds of formula I EMI3.1 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, at least one lipoxygenase inhibitor is used for the preparation of a cytoprotective pharmaceutical composition which contains as cytoprotective active ingredient at least one lipogenase inhibitor and, furthermore, at least one further biologically active ingredient, for example a further cytoprotective active ingredient and or a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to the use of lipoxygenase inhibitors generally, and preferably compounds of formula I, as cytoprotective active components Dr producing cytoprotective active pharmaceutical compositions.The so produced cytoprotective pharmaceutical compositions may be used to treat or prevent disease states such as erosive gastritis erosive esophagitis inflammatory bowel disease ethanol induced hemorrhagic erosions hepatic ischemia noxious agent induced damage or necrosis of hepatic, pancreatic, renal, or myocardial tissue liver parenchymal damage caused by hepatoxic agents such as CCl4 and D galactosamine ischemic renal failure disease induced hepatic damage bile salt induced pancreatic or gastric damage trauma or stressinduced cell damage and glycerol induced renal failure. The cytoprotective activity of a compound may be observed in both animals and man by noting the increased resistance of the gastrointestinal mucosa to the noxious effects of strong irritants, for example, the ulcerogenic effects of aspirin or indomethacin. In addition to lessening the effect of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs on the gastrointestinal tract, animal studies show that cytoprotective compounds will prevent gastric lesions induced by oral administration of strong acids, strong bases, ethanol, hypertonic saline solutions and the like. Two assays can be used to measure cytoprotective ability. These assays are A an ethanol induced lesion assay and B an indomethacin induced ulcer assay. A. Ethanol Induced Lesion Assay Twenty four hour fasted Sprague Dawley S.D. rats are perorally p.o. dosed with 1.0 ml absolute ethanol. Fifteen min. prior to ethanol administration, groups of rats each receive either an aqueous vehicle aqueous methylcellulose 5 wt. or the test compound at various doses perorally. One hour later, the animals are sacrificed and stomach ucosae are examined for resulting lesions. B. Indomethacin Induced Ulcer Assay Indomethacin, 10 mg kg p.o., is used to induce ulcers in 24 hr. fasted S.D. rats. Fifteen minutes prior to indomethacin administration, groups of rats each receive either an aqueous vehicle 5t wt. methylcellulose or the test compound at various doses perorally. Four hours later the animals are sacrificed and stomach mucosae are examined for resulting ulcers. As cytoprotective agents, the lipoxygenase inhibitors may generally be administered at a dosage range of 0.1 ug kg to 500 mg kg of body weight. The exact amount of inhibitor to be used will depend on, inter alia, whether it is being administered to heal damaged cells or to avoid future damage, on the nature of the damaged cells e.g., gastro intestinal ulcerations vs. nephrotic necrosis , and on the nature of the causative agent. The effective daily dosage level for compounds of Formula I inducing cytoprotection in mammals, especially humans, will range from about 1 ug kg to about 50 mg kg, preferably from about 10 vg kg to about 10 mg kg. The dosage may be administered in single or divided individual doses. Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human, with a cytoprotectively effective dosage of a lipoxygenase inhibitor. For example, oral, rectal, transdermal, parenteral, intramuscular, intraveneous and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules and the like. In practical use, ipoxygenase inhibitors can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or intravenous. In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions or carriers such as starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be sugar coated or enteric coated by standard techniques. In addition to the common dosage forms set out above, the lipoxygenase inhibitors may also be administered by controlled release means and or delivery devices such as those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,845,770 3,916,899 3,536,809 3,598,123 3,630,200 and 4,008,719.

TABLE 6 COMPOUNDS OF FORMULA IEMI43.1 Ra Rb Rc Rd t Bu t Bu H H t Bu t Bu F H t Bu t Bu Me H t Bu t Bu SMe H t Bu t Bu H OMe Formula I includes both novel and known compounds. These compounds may be prepared by any process available to the skilled artisan. One such process for compounds where X s involves the oxidation of the appropriate phenothiazine as illustrated by the following equations.EMI44.1 Various oxidizing agents and systems are taught in the art, e.g. PbO2, HNO3, K2Cr207,K2Cr207, iodine, FeC33 and the like. Another process useful for preparing someFormula I compounds containing halogen substituents is by direct halogenation of an appropriate phenothiazone or analog thereof as illustrated by the following equation.EMI44.2 Still another process useful for preparing many of the Formula I compounds is by the reaction of an appropriate aniline with an appropriate quinone as illustrated by the following equation EMI45.1 This general process is described in the literature. A specific process for preparing the intermediate phenothiazin 3 one is illustrated by the following equation EMI45.2 The process requires the use of 2 moles of quinone per mole of aniline. Any suitable solvent may be used.Example of such solvents are acetic acid, lower alkanols, acetic acid H20, loweralkanol water, other polar solvents and the like. A preferred solvent is one which will dissolve A, B and D and in which C is substantially insoluble. The reaction is readily carried out at room temperature lower temperatures, e.g. as low as 100C, may be used elevated temperatures may also be used but are not required. This process is more fully described in our copending application U.S. Serial Number 459,923, filed onJanuary 21, 1983, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Another useful process to prepare certain of the compounds of the present invention is the oxidation of certain phenothiazines or benzo a phenothiazines by standard oxidizing agents such as potassium dichromate, NaClO2, 2,3 dichloro 5,6dicyano 1,4 benzoquinone DDQ , and the like. Several of these benzota phenothiazines and phenothiazines are described in our copending applications U.S. SerialNumbers 539,342 and 539,215, respectively, both filed on October 5, 1983, which are hereby incorporated by reference. Examples for the preparation and use ofFormulae I and II compounds follow. These examples are provided merely as an aid to understand the instant invention and not as a limitation. All temperatures are in degrees Celsius and are uncorrected.

The resulting red mixture was stirred at zoom temperature for another 2 hours and then the duct 3H phenothiaz 3 one was filtered off. This 3H phenothiazin 3 one was washed thoroughly with methanol and dried to give 1 07 kg of 3H phenothiazin 3 one 61.49 yield , m.p. 157 1590C. Method B To a stirring solution of 1.1 kg of ceric ammonium nitrate in 12.5 liters of H2O and 1.25 liters of HOAc at 100C was added dropwise a solution of 100 g of phenothiazine in 500 ml acetone over a period of 20 minutes. The resulting mixture was stirred for another 20 minutes and the product 3H phenothiazin 3 one was then filtered off. The filtered 3H phenothiazin 3 one was washed with water thoroughly and dried to give 92 g of crude 3H phenothiazin 3 one. The crude 3H phenothiazin 3 one was extracted with minimum volume of CH2Cl2. Upon dilution of the CH2C12 solution with 10 times the volume of cyclohexane, a precipitate was formed which was filtered and dried to afford 35 g of 3H phenothiazin 3 one. EXAMPLE 2 4 Chloro 3H phenothiazin 3 one To a stirring solution of 500 g 2.34 mol of 3H phenothiazin 3 one in 12.5 liters of glacial acetic acid was added 1.25 kg of potassium.dichromate. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 2 hour.To this resulting mixture was then added 2.34 mol of a 1M solution of chlorine in glacial acetic acid dropwise over a period of 4 hours. The progress of the reaction was monitored by tlc to ensure no excess chlorine was added. After addition of chlorine was completed the mixture was stirred at room temperature for another 1 2 hour and was then poured into i20 liters of H20 with vigorous stirring. The 4 chloro 3H phenothiazin 3 one precipitated was allowed to settle overnight.
