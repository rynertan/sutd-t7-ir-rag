# Method for modifying polyfumaric acid diester.

## Abstract
According to the invention, a method for modifying a polyfumaric acid diester is provided. The method comprises subjecting the polyfumaric acid diester to thermal treatment to thereby obtain a polyfumarate having carboxyl groups. The polyfumaric acid diester is obtained by polymerizing a fumaric acid diester represented by the following general formula of
