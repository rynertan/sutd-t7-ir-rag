# DATA TRANSMISSION SYSTEM.

## Abstract
A data tranmission system for sending parallel data from the transmitting side to the receiving side. When a predeter mined period of time t₁ has passed after the transmission of an i th data item DTi, the transmitting side sends a high level data transmission signal DS to the receiving side. Upon receipt of the high level data transmission signal DS, the receiving side reads the i th data item DTi and sends a high level data reception signal DR back to the transmitting side. The transmitting side receives the high level data reception signal DR, and the i th data transmission cycle is completed. To transmit the next i l th data DTi l , the transmitting side sends a low level data transmission signal DS when a predetermined period of time t₁ has passed after the transmission of the i l th data item. Upon receipt of the low level data transmission signal DS, the receiving side reads the i l th data DTi l and sends the low level data reception signal DR back to the transmitting side. The low level data reception signal DR is received by the transmitting side, and the i l th cycle of data transmission is completed. The data is thus transmitted successively by repeating the i th and i l th data transmission cycles.
