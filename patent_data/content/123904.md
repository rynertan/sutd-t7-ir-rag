## Description
HEAT DEVELOPABLE PHOTOGRAPHIC MATERIAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a novel photographic material having improved developing properties.More particularly, the present invention relates to a photographic material containing a dye releasing redox compound which, when heated in a substantially water free state, reacts with a photosensitive silver halide to release a hdyrophilic dye. More particularly, the invention relates to a novel heat developable photographic material having improved developing properties. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENT ION Because of excellent photographic properties such as high speed and ease of tone control, silver halide photography has been used more extensively than any other photographic techniques such as electro photography and diazo process. Conventionally, the formation of image in silver halide photography is effected by the wet process wherein the photographic material containing a silver halide is processed with a liquid developer. However, in recent years, various techniques of the dry process have been proposed, according to which the desired image can be formed more readily and rapidly than in the wet process. Thermally developable photographic materials are known in the art and are shown, together with the methods for their processing, in Fundamentals of PhotographicEngineering . pp. 553 555, Corona Publishing Company, 1979 Eizo Joho Image Information , p. 40, April 1978 and Neblets Handbook of Photography and Reprography, 7th ed., pp. 32 33, Van Nostrand Reinhold Company. Other pertinents references are U.S. Patents Nos. 3,152,904, 3,301,678, 3,392,020 and 3,457,075 British Patents Nos.1,131,108 and 1,167,777 and Research Disclosure, June 1978, pp. 9 15 RD 17029 . Many methods have been proposed for producing color images by the dry process, and various methods are shown in the literature for providing a color image by the binding of a coupler to the oxidized product of a developing agent. U.S. Patent No. 3,531,286 shows the use of p phenylenediamine reducing agents and phenolic or activated methylene couplers. U.S. Patent No. 3,761,270 shows the use of p aminophenolic reducing agents. BelgianPatent No. 802,519 and Research Disclosure, September 1975, pp. 31 32 shows the use of sulfonamide phenolic reducing agents. U.S. Patent No. 4,021,240 proposes the use of combinations of sulfonamide phenolic reducing agents and four eauivalent couplers. However, according to these methods, both the image of reduced silver and a color image are formed in the exposed area after heat development, and this causes unavoidably the staining of the color image. This problem can be solved either by removing the silver Image by treatment with a liquid or by transferring the dye onto another layer, for example, an image receiving layer on a sheet.However, it is difficult to transfer only the dye and leave the unreacted material in the exposed area. A method wherein a nitrogen containing heterocyclic group is introduced into the dye to form a silver sa t and the dye is freed by heat development is shown in Research Disclosure, May 1978, pp. 54 58 RD 16966 .However, this method is not highly practical since it is difficult to inhibit the dye release in the unexposed area and a sharp image is not easily obtained. A method for producing a positive color image by bleaching heat developable silver dye is shown inResearch Disclosure, April 1976, pp. 30 32 RD 14433 , supra, December 1976, pp. 14 15 RD 15227 and U.S.Patent No. 4,235,957. These references show useful dyes and the specific methods of bleaching these dyes However, this method requires the additional step of heating of a superimposed activator sheet in order to accelerate the bleaching of the dye, and accordingly, an extra material is needed. Furthermore, the color image obtained is gradually reduced and bleached by the presence of free silver and hence is unable to withstand extended storage. Formation of a color image with a leuco dye is shown in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,985,565 and 4,022,617. However, with this method, the leuco dye cannot be stably incorporated in the photographic material and the color image obtained is slowly discolored during storage. We previously provided a new photographic material which was free from the defects of these conventional techniques and also provided an image forming process for that new material Japanese Patent Application No. 157,758 81 . This application proposed a photographic material capable of releasing a mobile hydrophilic dye by a simple step of heating in a substantially water free state, as well as an image forming process characterized by transporting said mobile hydrophilic dye to a dye fixing layer primarily in the presence of a solvent. SUMMARY OF TEE INVENTION As a result of further studies on the idea proposed in Japanese Patent Application No. 157,758 81, we have accomplished the present invention according to which the image of a mobile dye formed by heating in a substantially water free state can be enhanced in density whIle reducing the undesired fog. Therefore, one object of the present invention is to provide a heat developable photographic material capable of forming a high density color image by a short period of heat development effected either after or simultaneously with exposure. Another object of the present invention is to provide a heat developable photographic material which has low fog in the high density color image formed by effecting heat development either after or simultaneously with exposure. A further object of the present invention is to provide a heat developable photographic material that can be stored for an extended period before it is subjected to thermal processing. The present invention relates to a heat develop able photographic material having on a support 1 a photosensitive silver halide, 2 a binder, 3 a dv re asing redox compound that is capable of reducing the photosensitive silver halide and which upon heating reacts with the photosensitive silver halide to release a hydrophilic dye, and 4 a developing agent having the following formulaEMI5.1 wherein R is an aryl group and R1, R2, g3 and R which may be the same or different represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an aryl group, a carboxy group an alkoxy carbonyl group DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The developing agent used in the photogrpahic material of the present invention has the followingEMI6.1 wherein R is an aryl group R, R2, R3 and R4 which may be the same or different represent a hydrogen atom, an alkyl grc, an aryl group, a carobxy group or alkoxycarbonyl grout Examples of the aryl group having 6 to 22 carbon atoms designated by R include phenyl, naphthyl, tolyl and xylyl groups.

The useful concentration range is from 0.0005 mol to 20 mols per mol of silver, and a particularly useful range is from 0.001 to 4 mols per mol of silver. The developing agent of the present invetion may be introduced into the hydrophilic collidal layer by various methods. One suitable method is shown in U.S Patent No.2,322,027 which uses a high boiling organic solvent such as an alkyl ester of phthalic acid e.g. dibutyl phthalate or dioctyl phthalate , aphosphate ester e.g. diphenyl phosphate, triphenyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate or dioctylbutyl phosphate , a citrate ester e.g. tributyl acetylcitrate , a benzoate ester e.g. octyl benzoate , an alkylamide e.g. diethyllaurylamide , an aliphatic acid ester e.g. dibutoxyethy1 succinate or dioctyl azelate or trimesic acid ester e.a. tributyl trimesate .In another method, the developing agent is dissolved in an organic solvent having a boiling point of about 30 160 C, such as a lower alkyl acetate e.g.ethyl acetate or butyl acetate , ethyl propionate, secondary butyl alcohol, methylisobutyl ketone, 6 ethoxyethyl acetate, methyl cellosolve acetate or cyclohexanone, and the resulting solution is dispersed in the hydrophilic colloid. The high boiling solvent may be used in admixture with the low boiling solvent. The colloidal dispersion may also be formed with the aid of polymers as shown in Japanese Patent Publication No. 39853 76 andJapanese Patent Application OPI No. 59943 76 the symbolOPS as used herein means an unexamined published JapanesePatent Application . According to other methods, the developing agent may be directly dispersed in an emulsion, or alternatively, the agent is first dissolved in water or an alcohol, and the resulting solution is dispersed in gelatin or an emulsion. The developing agents of the present invention mav be used in combination with themselves. They may be contained in one emulsion layer blue sensitive, greensensitive or red sensitive layer or they maw be contained in all of these emulsion layers. If desired, they may be incorporated in one or more layers adjacent to the emulsion layers e.g. subbing layer, intermediate laver or protective layer. The developing agents may be incorporated at any stage of the manufacture of the photographic material of the present invention, but generally, they may be incorporated immediately before the application of a coating solution In the photographic material of the present invention, by means of heating that is effected in a sub stantially water free state either after or simultaneously with imagewise exposure, an oxidation reduction reaction as catalyzed by the exposed photosensitive silver halide takes place between the photosensitive silver halide and the reducing dye releasing redox compound.In consequence, not only the silver image but also the mobile hydrophilic dye image released from the dye releasing redox compound that has been oxidized by the silver halide is formed in the exposed area. However, with the heat development alone, it often occurs that part of the dye releasing redox compound remains unreacted in the exposed area and this is difficult to be distinguished from the released mobile hydrophilic dye image. In this case, the obtained color image which is made of a hydrophilic mobile dye can be transported to a dye fixing layer by placing said image in an atmosphere having affinity for the hydrophilic dye. By so doing, a color image of good quality that can be stored for an extended period can be produced.The atmosphere having affinity for the hydrophilic dye can be obtained either externally by supplying a solvent or internally by using a hydrophilic thermal solvent. The above described theory of operation is essentially the same whether a negative emulsion or an auto positive emulsion is used in the photographic material of the present invention. With the use of an autopositive emulsion, a dye image having good color reproduction can be formed by the same processing as in the case of using a negative emulsion except that only the mobile dye image, but not the silver image, formed in the unexposed area is transported to the dye fixina layer, In the present invention, the oxidation reduction reaction between the photosensitive silver halide and the dye releasing redox compound and the subsequent dye releasing reaction can be initiated by heating in a subtantially water free state.The term heating means the one effected to a temperature between 80 and 2500C, and the words 2substantially water free states mean the reaction system which is in equilibrium with the moisture in air and which need not be supplied with water in order to initiate or accelerate the reaction. For the specific definition of this state, see Rhe Theory of the Photographic Processes 4th Ed., edited by T.H. James, Macmillan, p. 374. According to the present invention, dyes to be released can be selected by properly selecting a dye releasing redox compound, and hence, various colors can be reproduced.Therefore, the dye image obtained in the present invention includes not only a monochromatic image but also a multicolor image, and the monochromatic image may include the one formed by the mixing of two or more colors. It has been generally understood that the dye releasing reaction is initiated by the attack by a nucleophilic reagent, and this reaction is normally carried out in an aqueous solution having a pH higher than 10. It is therefore quite unusual that with the photographic material of the present invention, a high degree of the dye releasing reaction can be attained by a simple means of heating in a substantially water free state. The two reactions described above proceed more smoothly in the presence of an organic silver salt as an oxidizing agent and a high image density can be obtained.Therefore, the presence of such an organic silver salt as oxidizing agent is a particularly preferred embpdi ment of the present invention, The dye releasing redox compound which releases a hydrophilic diffusible dye used in the present invention is represented by the following general formula Ir Ra SO D I wherein Ra represents a reducing group capable of being oxidized by the silver halide, and D represents an image forming dye portion containing a hydrophilic group.

Two or more of the dye releasing redox compounds can be used together. In these cases, two or more dye releasing redox compounds may be used together in order to represent the same color or in order to represent black color. The dye releasing redox compounds are suitably use in 2 used in a range from 10 mg m to 15 gm 2 and preferably 2 a range from 20 2 in 2 range from 20 mg m to l O g m in a total. The process for preparing the dye releasing redox compound is described in European Patent Application OPI No. 76,492. The dye releasing redox confound used in the present invention can be introduced into a layer of the light sensitive material by known methods such as a method as described in U.S. Patent 2,322,027. In this case, an organic solvent having a high boiling point or an organic solvent having a low boiling point as described below can be used.For example, the dye releasing redox compound is dispersed in a hydrophilic colloid after dissolved in an organic solvent having a high boiling point, for example, a italic acid alkyl ester for example, dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, etc. , a phosphoric acid ester for example, diphenyl phosphate, trishenyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, dioctylbutyl phosphate, etc. , a citric acid ester for example, tributyl acetylcitrate, etc. , a benzoic acid ester for example, octal benzoate, etc. , an alkylamide for example, methyl laurylamide, etc. , an aliphatic acid ester for example, dibutoxyethyl succinate, dioctyl acetate, etc. , a trimesic acid ester for example, tributyl trimesate, etc. , etc., or an organic solvent having a boiling point of about 300C to 1600C, for example, a lower alkyl acetate such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, etc., ethyl prosionate, secondary butyl alcohol, methyl isobutyl ketone, ss et.loxyethyl acetate, methyl cellosolve acetate, cyclohexanone, etc. The above described organic solvents having a high boiling point and organic solvents having a low boiling point may be used as a mixture thereof. Further, it is possible to use a dispersion method using a polymer as described in Japanese PatentPublication No. 39853 76 and Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 59943 76. Moreover, various surface active agents can be used when the dye releasing redox compound is dispersed in a hydrophilic colloid. For this purpose, the surface active agents illustrated in other part of the specification can be used. In the present invention, if necessary, a reducing agent may be used. The developing agent of the present invention is oxidized by the silver halide and or the organic silver salt oxidizing agent to form its oxidized product having an ability to oxidize the reducing group R in the dye releasing redox compound. a The following auxiliary developing agent may be used together with the developing agent of the present invention. The preferred auxiliary developing agent includes hydroquinone, alkyl substituted hydroquinones such as tertiary butylhydroquinone, 2,5 dimethylhydro undone, etc., catechols, Dyrogallols, halogen substituted hydroquinones such as chlorohydroquinone, dichlorohydroquinone, etc., alkoxy substituted hydroquinones such as methoxyhydroquinone, and polyhydroxybenzene derivatives such as methyl hvaroxynaphtnalene, etc.Further, methyl gallate, ascorbic acid, ascorbic acid derivatives, hydroxylamines such as N,N dit 2 ethoxyethyl hydroxylamine, etc., pyrazolidones such as l phenv 3 tvrazolidone, 4methyl 4 hydroxymethyl l Dhenyl 3 pyrazolidone, etc., reductones and hydroxy tetronic acids are useful. The auxiliary developing agent can be used in an amount of a fixed range. A suitable range is 0.0005 time by mol to 20 times by mol based on silver. A particularly suitable range is 0. Q01 time bv mol to 4 times by mol. The silver halide used in the present invention includes silver chloride, silver chlorobromide, silver chloroiodide, silver bromide, silver iodobromide, silver chloroiodobromide and silver iodide, etc. In the embodiment of the present invention in which the organic silver salt oxidizing agent is not used together with but the silver halide is used alone, particularly preferred silver halide is silver halide partially containing a silver iodide crystal in its grain. That is, the silver halide which shows the X ray diffraction pattern of pure silver iodide is particularly preferred. In photographic materials a silver halide containing two or more kinds of halogen atoms can be used. Such a silver halide is present in the form of a completely mixed crystal in a conventional silver halide emulsion. For example, the grain of silver iodobromide shows X ray diffraction pattern at a position correspond inc to the mixed ratio of silver iodide crystal and silver bromide crystal but not at a position correspond ing to pure silver iodide crystal and pure silver bromide crystal separately. Particularly preferred examples of silver halide used in the present invention include silver cklcroiodide, silver iodobromide, and silver chlorolodo bromide each containing silver iodide crystal in its grain and showing X ray diffraction pattern of silver iodide crystal. The process for preparing those silver halides is explained taking the case of silver iodobromide.That is, the silver iodobromide is prepared by first adding silver nitrate solution to potassium bromide solution to form silver bromide particles and then adding potassium iodide to the mixture. Two or more kinds of silver halides in which a particle size and or a halogen composition are different from each other may be used in mixture. An average particle size of the silver halide used in the present invention is preferably from 0.001 um to 10 um and more preferably from 0.001 Vm to 5 lgm The silver halide used in the present invention may be used as is. However, it may be chemically sensitized with a chemical sensitizing agent such as compounds or sulfur, selenium or tellurium, etc., or compounds of gold, platinum, palladium, rhodium or iridium, etc., a reducing agent such as tin halide, etc., or a combination thereof. The details thereof are described in T.H. James, The Theory of the PhOtOgraphic Process, the Fourth Edition, Chapter 5, pages 149 to 169. In the particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, an organic silver salt oxidizing agent is used together. The organic silver salt oxidiz inc agent is a silver salt which forms a silver image by reacting with the above described image forming substance or a reducing agent coexisting, if necessary, with the image forming substance, when it is heated to a tempera ture of above 800C and, preferably, above 1000C in the presence of exposed silver halide.By coexisting the organic silver salt oxidizing agent, the light sensitive material which provides higher color density can be obtained The silver halide used in this case is not al avs necessarily to have the characteristic in that zh silver halide contains pure silver iodide crystal the case of using the silver halide alone. Any silver halide which is known in the art can be used. Examples of such organic silver salt oxidizing agents include those described in European Patent An li cation OPI No. 76,492. A silver salt of an organic compound having a carboxy group can be used. Typical examples thereof include a silver salt of an aliphatic carboxylic acid and a silver salt of an aromatic carboxylic acid In addition, a silver salt of a compound containing a nercanto group or a thione group and a derivative thereof can be used. Further, a silver salt of a compound containing an imino group can be used. Examples of these compounds include a silver salt of benzotriazole and a derivative thereof as described in Japanese Patent Publication Nos.30270 69 and 18416 70, for example, a silver salt of benzotriazole, a silver salt of alkyl substituted enzo triazole such as a silver salt of methylbenzotriazole, etc., a silver salt of a halogen substituted benzotriazole such as a silver salt of 5 chlorobenzotriazole, etc., a silver salt of carboimidobenzotriazole such as a silver salt of butylcarboimidobenzotriazole, etc., a silver salt of 1,2,4 triazole or l H tetrazole as described in U.S. Patent 4,220,709, a silver salt of carbazole, a silver salt of saccharin, a silver salt of imidazole and an imidazole derivative, and the like. Moreover, a silver salt as described inResearch Disclosure, Vol. 170, No. 17029 June, 1978 and an organic metal salt such as copper stearate, etc., are the organic metal salt oxidizing agent capable of being used in the present invention. Methods of preparing these silver halide and organic silver salt oxidizing agents and manners of blending them are described in Research Disclosure, No. 17029, Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos.32928 75 and 42529 76, U.S. Patent 3,700,458, andJapanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 13224 74 and 17216 75. A suitable coating amount of the lightsensitive silver halide and the organic silver salt oxidizing agent employed in the present invention is in a total of from 50 mg mê to 10 g m calculated as an amount of silver. The dye releasing reaction is accelerated by a presence of a dye releasing activator as a nucleophilic reagent. If the organic silver salt oxidizing agent is used as the oxidizing agent, the silver halide must be present an effective distance away from the organic silver salt in order to ensure the early initiation of the dye releasing reaction, and therefore, the silver halide and the organic silver salt are preferably present within the same layer. Unlike the development in wet process, heat development is limited with respect to the diffusion of reactive molecular species and hence requires a prolonged reaction time. However, if too much time is spent in the heating for development, thermal reaction in the unexposed area proceeds to such an extent that an undesired fog is produced. In the present invention, it is possible to use a thermal solvent. The term thermal solvent means a non hydrolyzable organic material which melts at a temperature of heat treatment and melts at a lower temperature of heat treatment when it is present together with other components. Preferred examples of thermal solvents include compounds which can act as a solvent for the developing agent and compounds having a high dielectric constant which accelerate physical develop ment of silver salts. Examples of preferred thermal solvents include those described in European patent Application OP1 No. 76,492. Heat development under a presence of the thermal solvent accelerates developing rate and improves image quality. Although the role of the thermal solvent is not entirely clear, it would be the major role of the thermal solvent to aid a diffusion of reactive molecule. The light sensitive silver halide and the organic silver salt oxidizing agent used in the present invention are prepared in the binder as described below.Further, the dye releasing redox compound and developing agent are dispersed in the binder described below. The binder which can be used in the present invention can be employed individually or in a combination thereof. A hydrophilic binder can be used as the binder according to the present invention The typical hydrophilic binder is a transparent or translucent hydrophilic colloid, examples of which include a natural substance, for example, protein such as gelatin, a gelatin derivative, etc., a cellulose derivative, a pelysaccharide such as starch, gum arabic, etc,, and a synthetic polymer, for example, a water soluble polyvinyl compound such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, acrylamide polymer, etc. Another example of the synthetic polymer compound is a dispersed vinyl compound in a latex form which is used for the purpose of increasing dimensional stability of a photographic material. The silver halide used in the present invention can be spectrally sensitized with methine dyes or other dyes. Suitable dyes which can be employed include cyanine dyes, merocyanine dyes, complex cyanine dyes, complex merocyanine dyes, holopolar cyanine dyes, hemicyanine dyes, styryl dyes, and hemioxonol dyes Of these dyes, cyanine dyes, merocyanine dyes and complex merocyanine dyes are particularly useful.Any conventionally utilized nucleus for cyanine dyes, such as basic heterocyclic nuclei, can be contained in these dyes That is, a pyrroline nucleus, an oxazoline nucleus, a thiazoline nucleus, a pyrrole nucleus, an oxazole nucleus, a thiazole nucleus, a selenazole nucleus, an imidazole nucleus, a tetrazole nucleus, a pyridine nucleus, etc,, and further, nuclei formed by condensing alicyclic hydrocarbon rings with these nuclei and nuclei formed by condensing aromatic hydrocarbon rings with these nuclei, that is, an indolenine nucleus, a benzindolenine nucleus, an indole nucleus, a benzoxazole nucleus, a naphthoxazole nucleus, a benzothiazole nucleus, a naphthothiazole nucleus, a benzoselenazole nucleus, a benzimidazole nucleus, a quinoline nucleus, etc., are appropriate.The carbon atoms of these nuclei may also be substituted. As nuclei having a ketomethylene structure, 5 or 6 embered heterocyclic nuclei such as a pyrazolin 5 one nucleus, a thiohydantoin nucleus, a 2 thiooxazolidln 2,4 dione nucleus, a thiazolidin 2,4 dione nucleus, a rhodanine nucleus, a thiobarbituric acid nucleus, etc., may also be used in merocyanine dyes and complex merocyanine dyes. These sensitizing dyes can be employed individually, and can also be employed in combination thereof. A combination of sensitizing dyes is often used, particularly for the purpose of supersensitization. Representative examples thereof are described in U.S.Patents 2t688 545 2,977,229, 3,397,060, 3,522,052, 3,527,641r 3,617,293 3,628,964, 3,666,480, 3,672,898, 3,679,428, 3,703,377, 3,769,301, 3,814,609, 3,837,862 and 4,026,707, British Patents 1,344,281 and 1,507,803,Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 4936 68 and 12375 78, Japanese Patent Application OPT Nos. 110618 77 and 109925 77, etc. The sensitizing dyes may be present in the emulsion together with dyes which themselves do not give rise to spectrally sensitizing effects but exhibit a supersensitizing effect or materials which do not substantially absorb visible light but exhibit a supersensitizing effect. For example, aminostilbene compounds substituted with 2 nitrogen containing heterocyclic group e.g., those described in U.S. Patents 2,933,390 and 3,635,7211, aromatic organic acid formaldehyde cond nsarPs e.g., those described in U.S. Patent 3,743,510 , cadmium salts, azaindene compounds, etc., can be present.The combinations described in U.S. Patents 3,615,613, 3,615,641, 3,617,295 and 3,635,721 are particularly useful. In the present invention, various kinds of dye releasing activators can be used. The dye releasing activator means a substance which accelerates the oxidation reduction reaction between the light sensitive silver halide and or the organic silver salt oxidizing agent and dye releasing redox compound, or accelerates release of a dye by means of its nucleophilic action to the oxidized dye releasing redox compound in the dye releasing reaction subsequently occurred, and a base and a base precursor can be used. It is particularly advan tageous to use these dye releasing activators in order to accelerate the reactions in the present invention. Examples of preferred bases are amines which include trialkylamines, hydroxylamines, aliphatic polyamines, N alkyl substituted aromatic amines, Nhydroxyalkyl substituted aromatic gamines and bis Fp ialkylaminoXphenyl3methanes. Further, betaine tetramethylammonium iodide and diaminobutane dihydrochloride as described in U.S. Patent 2,410,644, and urea and organic compounds including amino acids such as 6 amino caproic acid as described in U.S. Patent 3,506,444 are useful. The base precursor is a substance which releases a basic component by heating. Examples of typical base precursors are described in British Patent 998,949.A preferred base precursor is a salt of a carboxylic acid and an organic base, and examples of the suitable carboxylic acids include trichloroacetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid and examples of the suitable bases include guanidine, piperidine, morpholine, ptoluidine and 2 picoline, etc Guanidine trichloroacetate as described in U S, Patent 3,220,846 is particularly preferred. Further, aldonic anides as described in Japanese Patent Application COPI No. 22625 75 are preferably used because they decompose at a high temperature to form bases. These dye releasing activators can be used in an amount of a broad range A useful range is up to 50 by weight based on the amount of a dry layer coated of the light sensitive material. A range of O.01 by weight to 40 by weight is more preferred. The dye releasing activators may be incorporated in any layer of the photograpilic material or in any layer of the dye fixing material. It is advantageous to use a compound represented by the general formula described below in the heat developable color photographic material in order to accelerate development and accelerate release of a dye.EMI67.1 wherein A1, A2, A3 and A4, which may be the same or different, each represents a hydrogen atom or a substituent selected from an alkyl group, a substituted alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an aralkyl group, an aryl group, a substituted aryl group and a heterocyclic group and A1 and A2 or A3 and A may CC.i ne with each other to form a ring. The above described compound can be used in an amount of broad range. A useful range is up to 20t by weightbased on the amount of a dry layer coated of the light sensitive material. A range of 0.1 by weight to 15 by weight is more preferred. It is advantageous to use a water releasing compound in the present invention in order to accelerate the dye releasing reaction. The water releasing compound means a compound which releases water by decomposition during heat development. These compounds are particularly known in the field of printing of fabrics, and NHoFetSO1 2 12H2O, etc., as described in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 88386 75 are useful. A support used in the light sensitive material or used as the dye fixing material, if desired, according to the present invention is that which can endure at the processing temperature. As an ordinary support, not only glass, paper, metal or analogues thereto may be used, but also an acetyl cellulose film, a cellulose ester film, a polyvinyl acetal film, a polystyrene film, a polycarbonate film, a polyethylene terephthalate film, and a film related thereto or a plastic material may be used. Further, a paper support laminated with a polymer such as polyethylene, etc., can be used. The polyesters described in U.S. Patents 3,634,089 and 3,725,070 are preferably used. The most preferred support is polyethylene terephthalate film.

It is particularly preferred that the molecule contains 5 or more of the recurring units of ethylene oxide. The nonionic surface active agents capable of satisfying the ahove described conditions are well known as to their structures, properties and methods of synthesis. These nonionic surface active agents are widely used even outside this field. Representative references relating to these agents include Surfactant ScienceSeries, Viol. I, Nonionic Surfactants edited by MartinJ. Schick, Parcel Dekker Inc., 1967 , and Surface ActiveEthylene Oxide Adducts edited by Schoufeldt N. PergamonPress, 1969 . Among the nonionic surface active agents described in the above mentioned references, those capable of satisfying the above escribed conditions are preferably employed in connection with the present invention. The nonionic surface active agents can be used individually or as a mixture of two or more of them. The polyethylene glycol type nonionic surface active agents can be used in an amount of less than 100t by weight, preferably less than 50 by weight, based on a hydrophilic binder. The light sensitive material of the present invention may contain a cationic compound containing a pyridinium salt. Examples of the cationic compounds containing a pyridinium group used are described inPSA Journal Section B 36 1953 , U.S. Patents 2,648,604 and 3,671,247, Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 30074 69 and 9503 69, etc. Further, in the present invention, it is possible to use a compound which activates development and stabilizes the image at the same time. Particularly, it is preferred to use isothiuroniums including 2hydroxyethylisothiuronium trichloroacetate as described in U.S. Patent 3,301,678, bisisothiuroniums including 1,8 3,6 dioxaoctane bis isothiuronium trifluoroacetate , etc., as described in U.S. Patent 3,669,670, thiol compounds as described in German Patent Application OLS No. 2,162,714, thiazolium compounds such as 2amino 2 thiazolium trichloroacetate, 2 amino 5 bromoethyl 2 thiazolium trichloroacetate, etc., as described in U.S.Patent 4,012,260, compounds having a sulfonylacetate as an acid part such as bis 2 amino 2 thiazolium methylene bis sulfonylacetate , 2 amino 2 thiazolium phenylsulfonylacetate, etc., as described in U.S. Patent 4,060,420, and compounds having 2 carboxycarboxamide as an acid part as described in U.S. Patent 4,088,496. In the present invention, though it is not always necessary to further incorporate substances or dyes for preventing irradiation or halation in the lightsensitive material, because the light sensitive material is colored by the dye releasing redox compound, it is possible to add filter dyes or light absorbing materials, etc., into the light sensitive material, as described inJapanese Patent Publication No. 3692 73 and U.S. Patents 3,253,921, 2,527,583 and 2,956,879, etc., in order to further improve sharpness. It is preferred that these dyes have a thermal bleaching property. For example, dyes as described in U.S. Patents 3,769,019, 3,745,009 and 3,615,432 are preferred. The light sensitive material used in the present invention may contain, if necessary, various additives known for the heat developable light sensitive materials and may have a layer other than the lightsensitive layer, for example, an antistatic layer, an electrically conductive layer, a protective layer, an intermediate layer, an antihalation layer, a strippable layer, etc. Examples of various additives include those described in Research Disclosure, Vol. 170, No. 17029 June, 1978 , for example, plasticizers, dyes for improving sharpness, antihalation dyes, sensitizing dyes, matting agents, fluorescent whitening agents and fading preventing agents, etc. If necessary, two or more layers may be coated at the same time by the method as described in U.S.Patent 2,761,791 and British Patent 837,095. Various means for exposure can be used in the present invention. Latent images are obtained by imagewise exposure by radiant rays including visible rays.Generally, light sources used in this invention include tungsten lamps, mercury lamps, halogen lamps such as iodine lamps, xenon lamps, laser light sources, CRT light sources, fluorescent tubes and light emitting diodes, etc. In the present invention, after the heatdevelopable color photographic material is exposed to light, the resulting latent image can be developed by heating the whole material to a suitably elevated temperature, for example, about 800C to about 2500C for about 0.5 second to about 300 seconds. A higher temperature or lower temperature can be utilized to prolong or shorten the heating time, if it is within the abovedescribed temperature range. Particularly, a temperature range of about 1100C to about 1600C is useful. As the heating means, a simple heat plate, iron, heat roller, heat generator utilizing carbon or titanium white, etc., or analogues thereto may be used. In the present invention, a specific method for forming a color image by heat development comprises transfer of a hydrophilic mobile dye. For this purpose, the heat developable color photographic material of the present invention is composed of a support having thereon a light sensitive layer I containing at least silver halide, if necessary, an organic silver salt oxidizing agent, a dye releasing redox compound which is also a reducing agent for the organic silver salt oxidizing agent, a developing agent and a binder, and a dye fixing layer Il capable of receiving the hydrophilic diffusible dye formed in the light sensitive layer . The above described light sensitive layer I and the dye fixing layer CII . may be formed on the same support, or they may be formed on different supports, respectively. The dye fixing layer II can be stripped off the light sensitive layer tI . For example, after the heat developable color photographic material is exposed imagewise to light, it is developed by heating uniformly and thereafter the dye fixing layer II or the light sensitive layer I is peeled apart.Also, when a light sensitive material having the light sensitive layer coated on a support and a fixing material having the dye fixing layer EI coated on a support are separately formed, after the light sensitive material is exposed imagewise to light and uniformly heated, the mobile dye can be transferred on the dye fixing layer II by superposing the fixing material on the lightsensitive layer. Further, there is a method wherein only the light sensitive layer I is exposed imagewise to light and heated uniformly by superposing the dye fixing layer II on the light sensitive layer I . The dye fixing layer 11 can contain, for example, a dye mordant in order to fix the dye. In the present invention, various mordants can be used, and polymer mordants are particularly preferred. In addition to the mordants, the dye fixing layer may contain the bases, base precursors and thermal solvents. In particular, it is particularly preferred to incorporate the bases or base precursors into the dye fixing layer II in the cases wherein the light sensitive layer f and the dye fixing layer are formed on different supports. Preferred polymer mordants used in the present invention can be polymers containing secondary and tertiary amino groups, polymers containing nitrogencontaining heterocyclic moieties, polymers having quaternary cation groups thereof, having a molecular weight of from 5,000 to 200,000, and particularly from 10,000 to 50,000.

In addition, mordants disclosed in U.S. Patents 2,675,316 and 2,882,156 can be used. The dye fixing layer II can have a white reflective layer. For example, a layer of titanium dioxide dispersed in gelatin can be provided on the mordant layer on a transparent support. The layer of titanium dioxide forms a white opaque layer, by which reflection color images of the transferred color images which can be observed through the transparent support is obtained. Typical dye fixing material used in the present invention is obtained by mixing the polymer containing ammonium salt groups with gelatin and applying the mixture to a transparent support. The transfer of dyes from the light sensitive layer to the dye fixing layer can be carried out using a dye transfer assistant. In the process in which the dye transfer assistants are supplied from the outside, water and an aqueous solution containing sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or an inorganic alkali metal salt can be used.Further, a solvent having a low boiling point such as methanol, N,N dimethylformamide, acetone, diisobutyl ketone, etc., and a mixture of such a solvent having a low boiling point with water or an alkaline aqueous solution can be used. The dye transfer assistant may be applied by wetting the dye fixing layer with the transfer assistant. When the dye transfer assistant is incorporated into the light sensitive material or the dye fixing material, it is not necessary to supply the transfer assistant from the outside. In this case, the abovedescribed dye transfer assistant may be incorporated into the material in the form of water of crystallization or microcapsules or as a precursor which releases a solvent at a high temperature. More preferred process is a process wherein a hydrophilic thermal solvent which is solid at a lower temperature and melts at a higher temperature is incorpo rated into the light sensitive material or the dye fixing material. The hydrophilic thermal solvent can be incorporated either into any of the light sensitive material and the dye fixing material or into both of them.Although the solvent can be imcorporated into any of the emulsion layer, the intermediate layer, the protective layer and the dye fixing layer, it is preferred to incorporate it into the dye fixing layer and or adjacent layers thereto. Examples of the hydrophilic thermal solvents include ureas, pyridines, amides, sulfonamides, imides, alcohols, oximes and other heterocyclic compounds. As a heating means to transport dyes, various means which are the same as the heating means for heatdevelopment can be employed. The hydrophilic thermal solvent used as the dye transport assistant is defined as a compound which is solid at room temperature but becomes liquid upon heating and which has a ratio of inorganicity to organicity of greater than 1 and a solubility in water at room temperature of greater than 1. The inorganicity and organicity are the concepts used to predict the properties of chemical compounds. For details of these concepts, see, for example, Kagaku no Rhoiki Chemical Domain , 11, p. 719 1957 . The hydrophilic thermal solvents are used to aid in the transport of the hydrophilic dye, so compounds capable of dissolving the hydrophilic dye are generally preferred as such solvents. It is empirically known that preferred solvents for a certain organic compound are those which have a ratio of inorganicity to organicity nearly approaching that of the organic compound. The dye releasing redox compound used in the present invention has a ratio of inorganicity to organicity of about 1, whereas the hydrophilic dye to be released from this dye releasing redox compound has a greater value than the dye releasing compound, preferably 1.5 or more, and more preferably at least 2.Since the hydrophilic thermal solvent used in the present invention preferSb transports onlv the hydrophilic dye, but not the dyereleasing redox compuod, it is necessary that the hydr ic thermal solvent have a ratio of inorganicity to organicity greater than that of the dye donating material. Therefore, the hydrophilic thermal solvent must have a ratio of inorganicity to organicity of at least 1, and the value of at least 2 is preferred. From a molecular size viewpoint, it is generally preferred that the dye being transported is surrounded by a molecule that will not interfere with the dye transport and which is capable of moving by itself. Therefore, the hydrophilic thermal solvent preferably has a small molecular weight, say, not more than about 200, and a particularly preferred molecular weight is not more than 100. In order to ensure the extended storage and easy handling of the photographic material, the heating temperature for causing dye transport should be within the range of 60 to 2500C, so in the present invention, compounds that exhibit the function of the hydrophilic thermal solvent within this temperature range may be properly selected. The hydrophilic thermal solvent must of course be able to aid in the rapid transport of dye upon heating, and in view of the limited heat resistance of the photographic material, the hydrophilic thermal solvent is required to have a melting point of 40 to 2500C, preferably 40 to 2000C, more preferably 40 to 1500C. The hydrophilic thermal solvent used in the present invention fulfills its function only if it effectively aids in the transport to the dye fixing layer of the hydrophilic dye formed by heat development. Therefore, the hydrophilic thermal solvent can be incorporated in various layers it may be incorporated in the dye fixing layer it may be incorporated in the light sensitive layer or the like in the photographic material it may be incorporated in both the dye fixing layer and the lightsensitive layer or an independent layer containing the hydrophilic thermal solvent may be incorporated in either the photographic material or a separate dye fixing material having the dye fixing layer. For the purpose of increasing the efficiency of transport to the dye fixing layer, the hydrophilic thermal solvent is pre ferably incorporated in the dye fixing layer and or an adjacent layer. The hydrophilic thermal solvent is usually dissolved in water before it is dispersed in a binder, but it may be dissolved in alcohols such as methanol and ethanol. The hydrophilic thermal solvent according to the present invention is applied in an amount of generally 5 to 500 wt , preferably 20 to 200 wt , more preferably 30 to 150 wt , of the total coating weight of the photo graphic material and or the dye fixing material. When the dye fixing layer is positioned on top of the photographic material, a protective layer may be further provided as required. Any of the protective layers conventionally used in photographic materials will serve the purpose. However, if the dye fixing layer is incorporated in a dye fixing material separate from the photographic material, it is preferred that the protective layer be also rendered hydrophilic so as not to interfere with the transport of the hydrophilic dye. In the photographic light sensitive material and the dye fixing material of the present invention, the photographic emulsion layer and other binder layers may contain inorganic or organic hardeners. It is possible to use chromium salts chromium alum, chromium acetate, etc. , aldehydes Cformaldehyde, glyoxal, glutaraldehyde, etc. , N methylol compounds dimethylolurea, methylol dimethylhydantoin, etc. , dioxane derivatives 2,3 dihydroxydioxane, etc. , active vinyl compounds 1,3 ,5 triacryloylhexahydro s triazine, 1,3 vinylsulfonyl 2. propanol, etc. , active halogen compounds C2,4 dichloro 6 hydroxy s triazine, etc. , mucohalogenic acids mucochloric acid, mucophenoxychloric acid, etc. , etc., which are used individually or as a combination thereof. With the use of the heat developable photographic material of the present invention the development time can be shortened, and in addition, a dye image of good quality having high density and low fog can be obtained.As a further advantage, the heat developable photographic material of the present invention is very convenient to use because it can be stored for a very long period before effecting heat development and yet has minimum variation in the reproduction of color image. The image forming process using the photographic material of the present invention having these features can not only be used in photography but also meet the recent demand for conversion from softy images to hard images. Furthermore, the dye image formed in the photographic material can be fixed in the dye fixing layer, so the image has not only good color reproduction but also improved archival quality. Therefore, the photographic material of the present invention can be conveniently used to meet the demand for extended image storage. For these reasons, the present invention surpasses the conventional photograhic techniques and will make a great contribution to the art. The advantages of the present invention are hereunder described in greater detail by reference to working examples, to which the invention is by no means limited.
