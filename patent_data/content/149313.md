# Internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
An internal combustion engine has an integral cylinder block, crankcase and sump structure made in two halves 1, 2. The material of the halves is chosen for lightness. The pressure pulsations in the cylinders are taken by long steel bolts 14, 15 which extend from the top of the cylinder head to a bearing structure comprising yokes steel clamping members 8, 9 clamped together by traverse fasteners 12, 13 holding together the two main crankshaft baring housing halves 6, 7 which are formed integrally with each half of the integral engine structure. The integral halves do not have re entrants and can be produced simply by casting, pressing or moulding.
