# Method of preparing coating compositions containing antisera and elements containing same.

## Abstract
A method for preparing a blush polymer coating com position containing active antisera comprises milling dehy drated antisera and the other materials used in the composi tion to uniformly disperse the antisera therein. This coating composition can be used to prepare analytical elements for determining analytes e.g. creatine kinase MB whereby the effects of potential interferents are immunochemically re moved. By milling the antisera into the coating composition, the resulting element has improved stability resulting in improved keeping in high humidity environments.
