# PART FORMING APPARATUS BY FLOW FORGING

## Abstract
An apparatus for forming a shaped part from a work includes two members spaced away from one another, which defines a pressure zone. First and second dies clamp the work therebetween, and a first roller conveyer transports at least one of the dies along a transport direction. At least one of the members defines an inclination with the transport direction so as to cause to pressure zone to converge therealong. A drive mechanism drives the dies to and from the pressure zone one of the dies includes a plurality of adjoining pressure transferring elements. Each pressure transferring element has a pressure transfer surface on one end thereof facing the one of the members, and a molding surface on the other end thereof. Self adjustable devices are interposed between the one of the members and the pressure transfer surface of the pressure transferring ele ments for maximizing pressure transfer to the pressure transfer surface.
