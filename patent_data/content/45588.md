# Flow meter.

## Abstract
A fluid flow meter of the type having a vaned rotor 56 mounted in a measuring chamber is provided with a series of inlet apertures arranged around the chamber with each aperture having one face 84 which extends sufficiently in the circumferential direction as to meet the opposite face 90 of the adjacent aperture. Since almost the entire periphery of the chamber wall is formed by apertures the collection of inflowing fluid is maximised whilst the apertures serve to direct at the rotor vanes 66 jets of fluid which are placed for maximum efficiency.
