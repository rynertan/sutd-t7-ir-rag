# Process for producing carbon black pellets and the pellets so produced.

## Abstract
Flocculent furnace carbon black is produced by contacting a feed hydrocarbon with hot combustion gases to pyrolyze the feed hydrocarbon. The hot combustion products produced by pyrolyzing include flocculent carbon black suspended in gases and are quenched to form a cooled effluent. The effluent is subjected to separation to separate the flocculent carbon black from the gases. The combustion products are cooled by quenching in a manner to maintain a photelometer value of the flocculent carbon black in predetermined range such that when the separated flocculent carbon black is subsequently pelleted a minimum loss of modulus results in the rubber into which the pelleted carbon black is compounded. The flocculent carbon black is pelleted under prescribed pelleting conditions and is dried under prescribed drying conditions to help achieve minimum modulus loss in the end product.
