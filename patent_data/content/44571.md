# Semiconductor laser device.

## Abstract
This invention consists in improvements in a buried heterostructure laser with buried optical guide, and facili tates the oscillation of the laser in the fundamental mode thereof and also enhances the available percentage of production of the laser. An active layer 3 and an optical guide layer 2 are sandwiched between two cladding layers 1,4 , to form an optical confinement region. The width of the semiconductor material assembly varies in the stacking direction of the layers 1 ... 4 , and the narrowest part 14 thereof is located on the side opposite to the optical guide layer 2 with reference to the position of the active layer 3 . The side surface of said semiconductor material assembly parallel to the travelling direction of laser radiation is buried by a burying layer 6 .
