## Description
This invention relates to a method for repeatedly absorbing and holding urine. More specifically, the method employs a urine absorbing a and holding material which is reusable by making use of a polymer of a specific meth acrylamide derivative insoluble in water. The water insolubilized polymer is combined for example with a fibrous support material. Diapers have been widely used for many years as materials for absorbing and holding urine. Reflecting the significant prolongation in the average span of human life and the rapid advancement in the medical technology in recent years, there are more and more people who are bedridden or are forced to live with physical handicap such as walking difficulties or hardship. There is an ever increasing demand for the materialization of welfare society for all people inclusive of such handicapped people. Specifically speaking, it is considered desirable to allow such people to lead lives similar to the life style of healthy people. For this purpose, various care or nursing aids, materials, equipment and systems have been developed. However, there are some difficult problems which are still waiting for solutions. One unsolved problem is how to cope with urination. It is difficult for bedridden patients admitted to hospitals or the like to deal with their urination at night. For those also having difficulties or hardship in walking, it becomes a serious problem should they have to deal with sudden desire to urinate. This unsolved problem leads to unpleasant feelings or discomfort after the incontinence of urine. It is also believed to be one of causes for diseases such as colds or chills if the spilled urine is left, especially in winter. To cope with this problem, it has been the practice to spread pads over beds to absorb urine or to use large diapers. These are, however, not fully satisfactory because they do not have sufficient urine absorbing and holding capacity and the absorbed urine can be released by pressure such as caused by the users body weights. Recently, attempts have been made to enhance urine absorbing and holding capacity by incorporating a hygroscopic resin such as a water insolubilized product of a polyacrylate salt in such absorbent pads or diapers. Although this approach has certainly been effective for enhancing the urine holding capacity, it has proved difficult to separate water from the wet resin if the used pads or diapers are meant to be used repeatedly. Due to this difficulty, it is practically impossible to use such pads or diapers repeatedly. This means that they have to be thrown away once they have been used, at substantial expense. Our earlier EP A 0 161 881, which was published after the present application was filed, discloses water absorbing polymers based on specific N alkyl or N alkylene substituted monomers. These polymers are disclosed fully hereinafter. The aim of the present invention is to provide a specific, useful application of these polymers, namely for absorbing urine on a repeated basis, it being found that the said polymers can be repetitively purged of urine and regenerated for re use. The absorbing and holding polymeric material has large urine absorbing and holding capacity and, to permit reuse, the urine absorbing and holding polymeric material permits easy release of water and has excellent drying properties absorbed urine components can promptly be released into water from the polymeric material to permit easy washing. According to the present invention, there is provided a method for repeatedly absorbing and holding urine which comprises The invention will now be explained in more detail in the following non limitative description. The following procedure may be followed to prepare the urine absorbing and holding polymeric material, which is water insolubilized product of a polymer or copolymer of at least one of the specific N alkyl or N alkylene substituted meth acrylamides defined hereinbefore. As examples of the above described polymer and copolymers, may be mentioned polymers and copolymers of at least one of the following N alkyl or N alkylene substituted acryl and methacryl amides Among the above described compounds, the N,N dialkyl substituted meth acrylamides are preferred. More preferred compounds are the N alkylene substituted meth acrylamides in each of which the two alkyl groups substituted to the amido group are combined together at their terminals to form a cyclic structure. Specifically, N meth acryloylpyrrolidines and N meth acryloylpiperidines are particularly preferred. The polymers, which are obtained by making the above described N alkylene substituted meth acrylamide polymers insoluble in water, feature that the reductions to their water absorbing capacity in electrolytic aqueous solutions are extremely small compared with their water absorbing capacity in pure water. In addition, one or more monomers selected from for example hydrophilic monomers, ionic monomers and hydrophobic monomers may additionally be copolymerized. As exemplary hydrophilic monomers, may be mentioned acrylamide, methacrylamide, N methylacrylamide, diacetoneacrylamide, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, various methoxypolyethyleneglycol acrylates, various methoxypolyethyleneglycol acrylates, and N vinyl 2 pyrrolidone. Further, vinyl acetate or glycidyl methacrylate for example may be introduced by copolymerization, followed by hydrolysis to impart hydrophilicity. Illustrative of such ionic monomers are acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, vinylsulfonic acid, allylsulfonic acid, methallylsulfonic acid, styrenesulfonic acid, 2 acrylamido 2 phenylpropanesulfonic acid and 2 acrylamido 2 methyl propanesulfonic acid and their salts amines such as N,N dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, N,N diethylaminoethyl methacrylate, N,N dimethylaminoethyl acrylate, N,N dimethylaminopropyl methacrylamide and N,N dimethylaminopropylacrylamide and their salts. Further, it is also possible to impart ionic properties by introducing various acrylates, methacrylates, acrylamides, methacrylamides or acrylonitriles by copolymerization and then hydrolyzing the thus introduced moieties. As hydrophobic monomers, may for example be mentioned N alkylacrylamide derivatives and N alkyl methacrylamide derivatives such as N n butylacrylamide, N n butylmethacrylamide, N tert butylacrylamide, N tert butylmethacrylamide, N n hexylacrylamide, N n hexylmethacrylamide, N n octylacrylamide, N n octylmethacrylamide, N tert octylacrylamide, N n dodecylacrylamide, and N n dodecylmethacrylamide N ω glycidoxyalkyl acrylamide derivatives and N ω glycidoxyalkyl methacrylamide derivatives such as N,N diglycidylacrylamide, N,N diglycidylmethacrylamide, N 4 glycidoxybutyl acrylamide, N 4 glycidoxybutyl methacrylamide, N 5 glycidoxypentyl acrylamide, and N 6 glycidoxyhexyl acrylamide acrylate derivatives and methacrylate derivatives such as ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate and glycidyl methacrylate acrylonitrile methacrylonitrile vinyl acetate vinyl chloride olefins such as ethylene, propylene and butene styrene α methylstyrene butadiene and isopropene. The acceptable proportion of such a hydrophilic, ionic or hydrophobic monomer to the acrylamide or methacrylamide derivatives may vary depending on the combination of the acrylamide or methacrylamide derivative and the above mentioned monomer. Although not sweepingly applicable to every combination, the hydrophilic, ionic and hydrophobic monomers may generally be used in amounts of 60 wt. or less, 30 wt. or less and 60 wt. or less, respectively. For water insolubilizing polymers of the above mentioned monomers, they may be insolubilized upon their polymerization or by treating them subsequent to their polymerization. As specific insolubilizing methods, the following various methods may be employed The above insolubilizing methods will next be described more specifically. In the first method, it is possible to use as exemplary crosslinkable monomers N,N methylenebisacrylamide, N,N diallylacrylamide, triacrylic formal, N,N diacryloylimide, N,N dimethacryloylimide, ethyleneglycol diacrylate, ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, various polyethyleneglycol diacrylates, various polyethyleneglycol dimethacrylates, propyleneglycol diacrylate, various polypropyleneglycol diacrylates, various polypropyleneglycol dimethacrylates, 1,3 butyleneglycol diacrylate, 1,3 butyleneglycol dimethacrylate, 1,4 butyleneglycol dimethacrylate, glycelol dimethacrylate, neopentylglycol dimethacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, trimethylolethane trimethacrylate, trimethylolethane triacrylate, tetramethylolmethane tetramethacrylate, tetramethylolmethane triacrylate, divinylbenzene and diallyl phthalate. The proportion of each of these crosslinkable monomers to the above described acrylamide derivative may vary depending on the combination of the acrylamide derivative and crosslinkable monomer as well as the desired crosslinking degree. Although not applicable sweepingly to every situation, the crosslinkable monomers may each be used in an amount of 0.01 10 wt. . N Alkoxymethyl meth acrylamide derivatives useful in the practice of the second method may include N hydroxymethyl meth acrylamides. For example, N methylol meth acrylamides, N methoxymethyl meth acrylamides, N ethoxymethyl meth acrylamides, N n butoxymethyl meth acrylamides and N tert butoxymethyl meth acrylamides may be used. The proportion of each of such N alkoxymethyl meth acrylamide derivatives to the above described acrylamide derivatives may vary depending on the combination of the acrylamide derivatives and the N alkoxymethyl meth acrylamide derivatives. Although not applicable sweepingly to every combination, the N alkoxymethyl meth acrylamide derivatives may each be used generally in an amount of 0.01 30 wt. . In the third method, the proportion of the hydrophobic monomer to the meth acrylamide derivative having amphiphilic property may vary depending on the combination of the meth acrylamide derivative and the hydrophobic monomer. Although not conclusively limitable, the proportion of the hydrophobic monomer may generally be 1 wt. or more, or preferably 3 wt. or more. In this case, the copolymerization may be effected using the random copolymerization method, the block copolymerization method or the graft copolymerization method. In the fourth method, the polymerization is carried out by the bulk polymerization method. This may be practiced by polymerizing the monomer as is without diluting it with any solvent to obtain a polymer block or by suspending the monomer in a solvent and then effecting the polymerization of the monomer in the form of droplets so as to obtain a granular polymer. In the fifth method, the polymer is subjected to a heat treatment. The heating conditions may vary depending on the polymer and do not remain constant. However, a polymer obtained by for example bulk polymerization, suspension polymerization or solution polymerization is heat treated generally at 60 250 C, or preferably at 80 200 C. In this case, when the polymer is obtained by the solution polymerization method, its heat treatment may be carried out concurrently with its drying or with the evaporation of the solvent. Turning to the sixth method in which the polymer is integrated with for example a fibrous material, the above described meth acrylamide derivative may be impregnation or graft polymerized to a water insoluble fibrous material such as natural or synthetic fibers such as cellulose fibers, nylon fibers, polyester fibers or acrylic fibers or non woven fabric made of polypropylene or an ethylene propylene copolymer, or to a water insoluble porous material such as silica, alumina or zeolite. Alternatively, the fibrous or porous material may be impregnated with the polymer. In the seventh method, the polyfunctional compound such as epichlorohydrin is reacted with the polymer so that the polymer is crosslinked and insolubilized. In this method, it is necessary to introduce hydroxyl, amino or carboxy groups in advance in the polymer. Amino and carboxy groups can be introduced readily by copolymerization. In the case of hydroxyl groups, they may be introduced by copolymerization hydroxyethyl methacrylate, isopropenyl phenol by first introducing for example vinyl acetate or glycidyl methacylate by the copolymerization method and then saponifying it with a basic material to form hydroxyl groups. Thereafter, the above prepared polymer and a polyfunctional compound such as epichlorohydrin are reacted to each other in the presence of a basic material so as to crosslink and insolubilize the polymer. When the polymer is insolubilized in an aqueous solution as is, it is converted into an agar like state. By simply crushing the thus obtained polymer, it can be used immediately. If it is solubilized after dispersing the aqueous solution in an oil, granular gels are obtained. According to the eighth method, a polymer complex is formed by copolymerizing the polymer with the above described monomer containing an active hydrogen or by combining the polymer with a copolymer of such a monomer. In this case, it is also possible to form a polymer complex by regeneration of the active hydrogen atoms of the copolymer which are substituted with ammonium ions or the like on mixing with the other component of the polymer by the addition of an acid then adding an acid to activate the active hydrogen atoms. The above described eight methods may be used singly or in combination. Generally speaking, more effective results are obtained when two or more of these methods are used in combination. As more specific polymerization methods which may be used for the production of urine absorbing and holding materials of use for practising this invention in accordance with the above mentioned methods, the following polymerization methods may be mentioned by way of example As solvents usable upon polymerization in the method 2 , it is possible to use a variety of solvents because meth acrylamide and their N substituted derivatives have very good miscibility with various solvents. More specifically, may be mentioned water, alcohols such as methanol and ethanol, cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and 1,4 dioxane, ketones such as acetone, amides such as N,N dimethylformamide and N,N dimethylacetamide, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene, halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform and methylene dichloride, chain glycols such as dimethyl sulfoxide, N methylpyrrolidone, diglyme and tetraglyme, and basic solvents such as pyridine. In the above specific polymerization methods, the polymerization may be initiated only by heating the polymerization systems. However, use of a polymerization initiator can generally bring about better results. No limitation is imposed on the polymerization initiator. Any polymerization initiators may be used so long as they can initiate radical polymerization. For example, inorganic peroxides, organic peroxides, combinations of such peroxides and reducing agents, and azo compounds may be mentioned. More specifically, such polymerization initiators may include ammonium persulfate, potassium persulfate, hydrogen peroxide, tert butyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, cumenehydroxy peroxide, tert butyl peroxy 2 ethyl hexanoate, and butyl perbenzoate. As reducing agents which may be used in combination with such polymerization initiators, may be mentioned sulfites, hydrogensulfites, salts of lower valence metals such as iron, copper and cobalt, organic amines such as aniline and reducing sugars such as aldose and ketose. Usable azo compounds may include azobisisobutylonitrile, 2,2 azobis 2 amidinopropane hydrochloride, 2,2 azobis 2,4 dimethylvaleronitrile and 4,4 azobis 4 cyanovaleic acid. Two or more of the above described polymerization initiators may be used in combination. In this case, the amount of the polymerization initiator to be added may be within the commonly employed amount range, for example, may be within the range of 0.01 5 wt. , or preferably 0.05 2 wt. , both based on the monomer. The thus obtained polymers, the block like polymer or the polymer obtained after evaporation of the solvent may be crushed into a powdery material or may be melted and then formed into a flake , fiber or film like material. The granular polymer may be provided as a granular material without need for any further processing. The latex like polymer may be provided to impregnate and coat a fibrous or porous material such as fabric or paper or may be formed into films to provide a urine absorbing and holding material. A powdery product may be obtained by various methods as described above, for example, by conducting gel polymerization in an aqueous solution and then drying and grinding the resultant polymer. A granular product may generally be produced with ease in accordance with the suspension polymerization method. Since the N alkyl or N alkylene substituted meth acrylamide derivative has generally high solubility in water, suspension polymerization may be practiced by the reversed phase suspension technique in which a monomer or its aqueous solution is dispersed in an oil, by the salted out suspension polymerization technique in which an electrolyte is dissolved in a large amount in an aqueous solution to reduce the solubility of a monomer, or by the precipitation and suspension polymerization technique in which polymerization is carried out at an elevated temperature of the cloud point of the intended polymer or higher so as to cause the polymer to precipitate. In addition, it is also possible to integrate the polymer with porous beads such as silica, alumina or zeolite, for example, by impregnating the porous beads with a solution of the polymer or effecting graft polymerization on such porous beads. It is also possible to incorporate a third component miscible with the monomer or monomers but immiscible with the resulting polymer when conducting polymerization in accordance with one of the above mentioned polymerization techniques. Incorporation of such a third component permits production of a porous resin. The urine absorbing and holding material prepared in the above manner is in a solid form and has unique properties in that it absorbs and holds water upon contact with an aqueous solution but when heated in the presence of a large excess of water, it shrinks and releases that water. As a still more convenient feature, the above described process of water absorption and holding and its release can be repeated. The amount of water, which the above material can absorb, varies depending on the composition of the polymer hereinafter abbreviated merely as the resin obtained by water insolubilizing the polymer or copolymer of its corresponding at least one of the N alkyl or N alkylene substituted meth acrylamides, the temperature at the time of water absorption, the composition of each aqueous solution, etc. Dealing with the resin composition, in the case of a copolymer with a hydrophobic monomer out of the above described copolymerizable monomers, the amount of absorbable water decreases but the mechanical strength of the resin increases as the proportion of the hydrophobic monomer increases. In the case of a copolymer with either hydrophilic or ionic monomer, the amount of absorbable water itself increases as the proportion of the hyrophilic or ionic monomer increases. However, the amount of absorbable water becomes less dependent on the temperature and the mechanical strength of the polymer decreases as the proportion of the hydrophilic or ionic monomer becomes higher. The amount of absorbable water by each resin changes in accordance with the composition of the resin as mentioned above. At room temperature 25 C , the resin can generally absorb water as much as about 2 100 times its own weight. More water can be absorbed if the temperature is lowered. Furthermore, the resin has a property which is extremely convenient as a urine absorbing and holding material, in that the resin shrinks and releases the water when its temperature is raised subsequent to its water absorption. When the temperature of the resin is raised further, the shrinkage of the resin may become extremely little beyond a certain temperature. In other words, a transition point may be observed as to its shrinking phenomenon. This transition point is determined by the composition of each resin. It may generally be controlled within the range of 10 100 C. The degree of shrinkage of each resin around its transition point may vary depending on the composition of the resin, the composition of each aqueous solution and the like, it is usually about 1 to 20 times its own weight. After allowing the resin to absorb urine in an amount as much as about 20 times its own weight, the resin may thus be subjected to washing, heating and removal of accompanying water to reduce its holding water to an amount about 5 times its own weight and the resin may then be dried. On the other hand, low molecular weight substances such as inorganic salts, organic salts, water soluble organic substances and the like are dissolved in urine. The urine absorbing and holding material used in practising this invention can take urine into its resin as is, namely, as an aqueous solution with such substances contained therein. If inorganic salts are contained in their dissolved forms, conventional water absorbing resins showed remarkable reductions to the amounts of water which they were able to absorb. For example, in the case of an acrylamide sodium acrylate copolymer content of sodium acrylate 21 wt. crosslinked by methylenebisacrylamide, the amount of absorbable water drops to one seventeenth in a 1N aqueous solution of sodium chloride compared with the amount of its absorbable water in distilled water. On the other hand, the percent reduction of absorbable water is around 10 in the case of the urine absorbing and holding material used in the method of this invention. Therefore, the amount of absorbable water is little affected by concomittant substances in urine. This means that the urine absorbing and holding material used in the method of this invention can achieve the same level of urine absorbing effects in a resin amount smaller than a conventional hygroscopic resin provided that the amounts of pure water, which they can absorb respectively, are equal. This feature is particularly effective when the urine absorbing and holding material is repeatedly used, in accordance with the method of this invention, because the difference between the degree of its swelling in urine and that at the time of its washing is small and substantially no additional water is hence absorbed at the time of its washing. In the case of such a conventional water absorbing resin, it is thus necessary for absorbing the same amount of water to add it in an amount as much as at least 20 30 times when applied to urine compared with pure water. As a result, the resin volume increases considerably during its washing due to absorption of water by the resin. This becomes a serious problem in using this conventional resin repeatedly. As has been described above, the urine absorbing and holding material used in practising this invention absorbs urine in a dry state. Thereafter, it is washed and subjected to removal of accompanying water. The resin is then dried for its regeneration, preferably, by exposing it to an atmosphere of an elevated temperature. In view of the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere, the temperature of urine is within the range of 0 40 C at the time of urine absorption. In order to heat the water absorbed resin so to cause the resin to undergo shrinkage subsequent to its washing on the other hand, it is only necessary to exposure it to an atmosphere of a high temperature. This may be achieved in air, in hot water, or by means of a heating device such as iron, press or the like. Although the heating temperature varies depending on the atmosphere, a relatively low temperature may be used where the heating device or atmosphere has a large capacity. In the opposite case, higher temperatures are preferred. It may generally be 30 200 C, preferably 40 120 C, and more preferably 50 90 C. The above described absorption and holding of urine and the above mentioned release of water and drying under heat appear to proceed conveniently, because the resin has been confirmed by electronmicroscopy to form a honeycomb structure of minute cells and it can thus maintain a porous aqueous gel structure . As a specific method for achieving the absorption and holding of urine, it is only necessary to bring the resin into contact with urine. For this purpose, the absorbing and holding materials takes the form of a powder, granules, flakes, film or fibres, the latter for instance being formed into a woven fabric or a non woven fabric . These absorbing and holding materials are used after combining them with other materials into composite materials which effect efficient absorption and holding of urine and for achieving prompt drying upon repeated utilization. As such composite materials, may be mentioned those obtained by combining the urine absorbing and holding materials of the above described forms hereinafter abbreviated as the above material or materials with a support comprising woven or non woven fabrics made of a variety of fibrous materials into composite materials, those obtained by integrating the various fibrous materials and the above materials in accordance with such a method as impregnation, graft polymerization or the like and then processing them into woven fabrics or non woven fabrics, and those obtained, on the contrary, by integrating woven fabrics or non woven fabrics with the above materials such as by impregnation, graft polymerization or the like, and those obtained by combining the above procedures. As the above described fibrous material, natural fibers, semi synthetic fibers and synthetic fibers are all usable. Specific examples of the fibrous material may include, for example, cotton, hemp, silk, acetate rayon, cuprammonium rayon, viscose rayon, pulp, acrylic fibers, nylon, vinylidene fibers, vinylon, fluorocarbon fibers, promix fibers, polyurethane fibers, polyester fibers, polyethylene fibers, polyvinyl chloride fibers, polypropylene fibers, asbestos, glass fibers, silica fibers, carbon fibers, and so on. They may be filaments or staples. They may be in any of the forms of woven fabrics, non woven fabrics, flocculent materials like cotton wool hereinafter abbreviated as flocculent material or materials and pulplike materials. These materials may be used in combinations. The simplest specific method for combining a fibrous material and the above material into a composite material, is to sandwich the above material between the entire areas or some areas of layers of woven or non woven fabrics, and then to sew the thus combined material and fabrics or to unite them together by pressure or heat. Here, a flocculent material, pulplike material, non woven fabrics or the like may be interposed between the material and the non woven or woven fabrics in order to prevent movement of the material and to soften the resulting composite material. As a more specific method for combining the above material and the fibrous material into a composite material, the above material is spread or distributed on or in the fibrous material. Alternatively, one or more parts of the fibrous material are formed into one or more pockets or bags, in which the above material is then filled. In some instances, the above material may be sandwiched by the fibrous material. Thereafter, the thus combined materials are sewn or applied with pressure or heat to unite them together. As a sewing method, quilting or the like may be mentioned. As a unification method making use of pressure or heat, the combined materials may be pressed while heating their surfaces uniformly or the combined materials may be heated locally so as to subject them to spot or line melt bonding. In the above method, the amount of the above material to be used in combination with the fibrous material varies depending on the application purpose of the resulting composite material and application conditions. If the amount of the above material added to the fibrous material is too little, the amount of urine absorbable in the resulting composite material will be small. Thus, the resulting composite material will not be able to show any noticeable effect. If the amount is too much on the other hand, the volume of the above material will change considerably as urine is being absorbed. As a result, some inconvenience will be developed, for example, the united composite material will be broken. The amount of the above material may generally be used in an amount of 2 g m² 2,000 g m² or preferably 5 g m² 1,000 g m² per every layer of the fibrous material or for the entire layers of the fibrous material. As a method for integrating the above material with one of various fibrous materials by impregnation, graft polymerization or the like and then processing the thus combined materials into woven or non woven fabrics, an N alkyl or N alkylene substituted meth acrylamide is polymerized in the presence of the above described material. The resultant homopolymer, first copolymer or second copolymer is insolubilized either separately if necessary or simultaneously with its formation so that the above material and the fibrous material are united together. Thereafter, the thus united materials are formed into a woven or non woven fabric by a method known As a method for uniting the above material with one or more woven or non woven fabrics by impregnation, graft polymerization or the like, the above described homopolymer, first copolymer or second copolymer is produced in the presence of the woven or non woven fabrics in the same manner as described above. The homopolymer, first copolymer or second copolymer is insolubilized either separately if necessary or simultaneously with its formation. More firmly united composite materials may also be produced by conducting spinning or forming non woven fabrics in the presence of the above material. The manner in which the composite material formed of the above material and the fibrous material, is put to use varies depending on the person. Thus, for completely bedridden people, it may be used as sheet like pads, to be spread between their bedding and their lap areas, or as diapers. In the case of people capable to some extent of locomotion, it may be used as diapers or drawers like underwear hereinafter abbreviated as incontinence drawers . For those capable of locomotion but having difficulties of hardship in walking, it may be provided as incontinence drawers. More specifically, a sheet like pad may be provided by dispersing the above material As its application method, the waterproof film or fabric may be simply brought into contact with one side of the composite material of the above material and fibrous material. The said one side is opposite to the side where the composite material is kept in contact with the human body while in use. Alternatively, the waterproof film or fabric may have dimensions somewhat larger than the corresponding composite material, and the outwardly extending or overlap portions of the waterproof film or fabric may be folded inwardly. Here, the form of the above material varies depending how the resulting composite material is used. When it is desired to absorb urine promptly, it is preferably for the above material to have a relatively large specific surface area. When it is desired to hold urine firmly on the other hand, the above material is used with a relatively large grain size. After absorbing and holding urine in the above manner, the composite material is washed, usually in a washing machine, to remove the urine. By washing, the amounts of urine components still remaining in the above material can be reduced to ignorable levels. This is extremely convenient from the viewpoint of assuring good sanitation. Furthermore, accompanying water may be removed by centrifugation or the like if necessary. Then, the washed composite material which contains the above material is exposed to the elevated temperature mentioned earlier. The water readily evaporates, thus drying the composite material. As a specific method for practicing above drying, a hot air drier may be used. The composite material may be heated, for example, by blowing steam against it, immersing it in hot water or pressing it under heat with an iron, hot rolls or the like, whereby the water is released as liquid and the above material is thus caused to shrink. Thereafter, the composite material is heated to evaporate any remaining water as water vapor, thus drying it. The resulting regenerated composite material may be repeatedly used as a uring absorbing and holding composite material as many times as desired. Since the above described urine absorbing and holding material can release water in its liquid form without undergoing any phase change by its mere heating, it can be promptly dried after washing. Thus, its regeneration operation can be carried out with ease. When the said material is dispersed in water after absorbing and holding urine in its honeycomb structure, urine components are allowed to diffuse promptly into the water. It is thus easy to wash such urine components from the above material in the washing step. This feature is extremely convenient from the standpoint of sanitation. Since the difference between its swollen volume upon absorbing and holding urine and that upon absorbing and holding water is small, it is affected little by the presence of inorganic salts, and its volume change between the urine absorbing step and the washing step is small. The above material has thus brought about another advantageous effect in that damage to the final product due to its volume changes upon its repeated use can be minimized. The above described urine absorbing and holding material, and, in particular, the urine absorbing and holding composite material is an especially useful care or nursing aid for those who are bedridden or are forced to live with a physical handicap involving walking difficulties or hardship. It is also useful as an auxiliary material for infants when they start to wear drawers instead of diapers. Referential Example 1 Respectively placed in graduated cylinders, each filled with 50 ml of distilled water, were 1.0 g portions of powder samples employed in the Examples which will be described herein. Their equilibrium water absorptions were measured at 25 C and 50 C in terms of volumes in their corresponding graduated cylinders. An aqueous solution of N acryloylpyrrolidine containing 0.5 wt. of N,N methylenebisacrylamide was prepared by dissolving 507.5 g of N acryloylpyrrolidine and 2.6 g of N,N methylenebisacrylamide in 1,170 g of distilled water. After chilling the aqueous solution to 10 C, it was transferred to a Dewar bottle made of stainless steel and having an internal volume of 2 ℓ. Nitrogen gas was bubbled at a flow velocity of 1 ℓ mm for 1 hour through a ball filter. To the resultant aqueous solution, were simultaneously added a solution containing 2.55 g of ammonium persulfate dissolved in 10 g of distilled water and another solution containing 1.16 g of sodium hydrogensulfite dissolved in 10 g distilled water. The aqueous solution was adiabatically polymerized. After chopping the thus obtained gel into small pieces and drying the same, it was ground further. A 20 100 mesh fraction Tyler mesh number was collected as a sample. A bed pad made of a rayon and having a thickness of about 1.5 cm and a size of 120 cm x 180 cm was unsewn at an area of 80 cm x 120 cm which corresponded to the lap area of a man during its use. After uniformly spreading 25 g of the sample powder between the upper and lower layers of the pad, it was resewn as it had been so that a test sample was prepared. No unusual feeling was observed at all as the sense of touch and the like of the thus obtained test sample. It felt the same as the original product. The area of the test sample, in which area the sample powder was held, was soaked with 300 ml of 0.1 N saline. Five minutes later, that area was pressed by a hand. The surface of the test sample was dry and no release of water was felt. The hand was not wetted at all. There were no substantial changes observed on the external appearance of the test sample after the absorption of the saline. Thereafter, the saline soaked test sample was washed with a normal detergent, under usual conditions, in a conventional electric washing machine. Water was then removed by centrifugation. No substantial changes were observed on the external appearance of the test sample. After the water removal, the test sample was immersed in distilled water. An aqueous solution of silver nitrate was dropped into a portion of the immersing water, but clouding was not observed. It was thus confirmed that the salt had been completely removed. Thereafter, the test sample was dried at 90 C, for 30 minutes, in a normal hot air drier. The feeling to touch and the like of the test sample were not different from its feeling to touch and the like before the test. The test sample had been dried completely. The above described steps of the saline absorption, washing and drying were repeated 60 times. No significant changes were however observed as to the saline absorbing and holding capacity and drying readiness of the test sample after the test. A similar test was conducted by using 300 ml of urine in place of the saline. No differences were observed compared with the results obtained above by using the saline. A bed pad of the same type as that employed in Example 1 was soaked with 300 ml of 0.1 N saline at an area of 80 cm x 120 cm which corresponded to the lap area of a man during its use. Five minutes later, a hand was pressed on that area. The surface of the test sample was very wet and the hand was wetted immediately. The same area was again pressed by hand one hour later, and the hand was wetted. A sample powder was obtained by using an aqueous solution containing 400.9 g of acrylamide, 106.6 g of sodium acrylate and 2.6 g of N,N methylenebisacrylamide dissolved in 1,170 g of distilled water and conducting its polymerization, drying and grinding in the same manner as in Example 1. By using 25 g of the sample powder and a bed pad of the same type as that employed in Example 1, a test sample was obtained in the same manner as in Example 1. A similar test was conducted thereon. Namely, the test sample was washed after it had been soaked with 300 ml of 0.1 N saline. At the stage of rinsing, the area where the sample powder was held was swollen considerably and the thickness of that area became significantly greater than the remaining area. The test sample was weighed. It was found that its weight increased by 8 kg compared with its weight before its washing. It was also dried by hot air under the same conditions as those employed in Example 1. Even after drying, it had not been fully dried in the area where the sample powder was held. The thickness of that area was still greater than that of the remaining area. It was dried for a time period ten times longer than the drying time in Example 1. However, its dryness was still insufficient. Its thickness had not yet returned to the same level as the thickness of the remaining area. A gel was obtained in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the initiation temperature of the polymerization was raised to 20 C and an aqueous solution containing 4.41 g of 2,2 azobis 2 amidinopropane hydrochloride dissolved in 20 g of distilled water was used as a polymerization initiator. After chopping the thus obtained gel into small pieces and drying the same, it was ground further and its 100 mesh fraction was collected as a sample. Eleven sheets total weight 193 g of 30 cm x 80 cm non woven fabrics, each of which was composed of polypropylene and a rayon, were superposed. Between each pair of layers, 2 g of the above obtained sample powder was evenly spread to a total amount of 20 g. On one side of the resultant composite material, a breathable polyethylene film was applied. The composite material and polyethylene film were then sewn together to provide a test sample. The test sample did not feel stiff and its feeling to touch was good. The test sample was soaked with 300 ml of 1 N saline. Five minutes later, the test sample was pressed by a hand. The surface of the test sample was dry and the hand was not wetted at all. After washing the saline soaked test sample and then removing its water under the same conditions as those employed in Example 1, it was immersed in distilled water. An aqueous solution of silver nitrate was dropped to a portion of the immersing water. No development of cloud was observed. It was thus confirmed that the salt had been completely removed. Furthermore, the test sample was dried under the same conditions as those used in Example 1. The feeling to touch and the like of the test sample were not changed at all after the test. The test sample had been dried sufficiently. A similar test was conducted by using human urine in place of 0.1 N saline. Exactly the same results were obtained. A portion of the sample powder obtained in Comparative Example 2 was ground further and its 100 mesh fraction was collected as a sample powder. By using 20 g of the sample powder, a test sample was obtained in the same manner as in Example 3. Then, it was tested. The test sample was swollen considerably at the stage of rinsing. Its thickness increased and the sewn parts were destroyed at several locations. Some of the sample powder had thus been lost. Eleven sheets total weight 257 g of 40 cm x 80 cm non woven fabrics, each of which was composed of polypropylene and a rayon, were superposed. Between each two layers, 5 g of the sample powder obtained in Example 3 was evenly spread to a total amount of 50 g. On one side of the resultant composite material, a breathable polyethylene film was applied. The composite material and polyethylene film were then sewn together. A paper pattern, which was of such a shape that two regular triangles, one having a side of 30 cm and the other a side of 35 cm, were placed with one of the vertexes of the former triangle having been brought into a face to face relation with one of the vertexes of the latter triangle and the mutually confronting vertexes were connected together with a band of 10 cm wide, was then placed on the above prepared sewn composite material. It was cut along the paper pattern and was then sewn along its contour to provide a test sample. It is generally called incontinence drawers . The test sample was then applied to the lap area of a male adult. While holding it in rubber drawers, 300 ml of 0.1 N saline was poured thereinto from the front part of his body. The saline did not leak out. When the test sample was touched by a hand 5 minutes later, its surface was dry and the hand was not wetted. In addition, no particular unpleasant feeling was felt while the test sample was worn. Thereafter, the test sample was washed and dried under the same conditions as those employed in Example 1. After drying, the feeling to touch and the like of the test sample were not different from its feeling to touch and the like before the test. It had thus been fully dried. Furthermore, the test sample was worn in the above manner and urination was actually made in the test sample. Urine did not leak out. It was absorbed and held in the test sample. In addition, no particular unpleasant feeling was felt while the test sample was worn. Thereafter, the test sample was washed and dried under the same conditions as those employed in Example 1. After its drying, the feeling to touch and the like of the test sample were not different from its feeling to touch and the like before the test. It had thus been fully dried. Sample powders were obtained by effecting polymerization and grinding in the same manner as in Example 1 except that instead of N acryloylpyrrolidine in Example 1, N isopropylacrylamide Example 4 , N n propylacrylamide Example 5 and N acryloylmorphorin Example 7 were used. Using the respective sample powders in their corresponding amounts given in Table 1, the absorption of 0.1 N saline or urine and their feeling to touch after their drying were evaluated in accordance with the testing methods noted in the table, namely by using pads or diapers as indicated against the Example numbers in Table 1. In Example 6, the sample was prepared in the following manner, on which a similar test was conducted. A 30 N,N dimethylformamide solution containing 0.5 of N,N methylenebisacrylamide in N,N diethylacrylamide was transferred into a Dewar bottle. After purging the liquid with nitrogen, 1.5 of azobisisobutylonitrile was added at 30 C, followed by adiabatic polymerization of the solution. The resulting gel was chopped and dried at 120 C. It was then ground to collect its 20 100 mesh fraction. On a sheet of cotton gauze which had been cut into a trapezoidal shape having a lower side of 25 cm long, an upper side of 8 cm long and a height of 25 cm, was superposed a pad of polyester cotton of 80 g m² which had also been cut into the same shape. Then, 25 g of the sample powder obtained in Example 1 was spread evenly on the polyester cotton pad. An additional pad of polyester cotton of the same shape and an additional sheet of cotton gauze also of the same shape were superposed on the thus spread sample powder. The tiered layers were then compressed for 1 minute at 120 C and at a pressure of 100 kg cm². After sewing the resultant composite material in a diamond pattern, a moisture permeable and waterproof fabric a polyester fabric with its one side urethane coated which had been cut into a trapezoidal shape having a lower side of 31 cm, an upper side of 14 cm and a height of 31 cm was brought into a contiguous relation with the sewn composite material. It was then sewn on the inner surface of a bottom part of ladies knickers made of knitted cloth, thereby providing sample incontinence drawers. Upon sewing the composite material on the ladies knickers, an approximately 3 cm wide marginal portion of the moisture permeable and waterproof fabric was folded back onto the cotton gauze. The inside of the sample incontinence drawers was gradually soaked with 300 ml of human urine. Five minutes later, a hand was pressed on the urine soaked area. The surface of the test sample was dry and no release of urine was observed. The hand was not wetted at all. No substantial changes were observed on its external appearance. Then, the test sample was subjected to washing and water removal under the same conditions as those used in Example 1. No unusual changes were observed during its washing. After water removal, the weight of the test sample was measured. It was found to be 575 g. The test sample was thereafter dried at 90 C for 30 minutes in a hot air drier. After the test sample had been dried, its feeling to touch and the like were not different at all from its feeling to touch and the like before the test. It had thus been fully dried. Furthermore, the test sample was worn and urination was actually effected therein. No leakage of urine was observed. Thus, the urine was absorbed and held in the test sample. During use, no particular unpleasant feeling was experienced. Thereafter, the test sample was subjected to washing and water removal under the same conditions as those employed in Example 1. It was then immersed for 20 minutes in hot water of 90 C so that it was subjected to a heating treatment. Water was thereafter removed from the test sample and its weight was measured. It was found to be 132 g. The test sample was then dried at 60 C for 30 minutes in a hot air drier. Its feeling to touch and the like were not different at all from its feeling to touch and the like before the test. It had thus been fully dried. On a non woven rayon fabric which had been cut into a rectangular shape of 25 cm long and 14 cm wide, a non woven polyester fabric cut into the same shape was superposed. Then 25 g of the sample powder obtained in Example 1 was spread evenly thereon. The resultant material was folded double along the longer sides thereof, and was then compressed for 1 minute at 120 C and 100 kg cm². After sewing the resultant composite material in a diamond pattern, its outer edge portions were sewn so as to form it into a bag like shape. The composite material was then brought into a contiguous relation with a central part of a moisture permeable waterproof fabric of the same shape and material as that employed in Example 8 with the upper and lower sides of composite material being in registration with those of the trapezoidal moisture permeable and waterproof fabric. Over the thus combined materials, a pad of polyester cotton and a sheet of cotton gauze, each, of the same shape were successively superposed. Similar to Example 8, the moisture permeable waterproof fabric was folded back. The resultant composite material was then sewn on the inner surface of a bottom portion of ladies knickers made of a knitted cloth so that sample incontinence drawers were produced. The inside of the sample incontinence drawers was gradually soaked with 300 ml of human urine. Five minutes layer, a hand was pressed on the urine soaked area. The surface of the test sample was dry and no release of the urine was observed. The hand was not wetted at all. No substantial changes were observed on its external appearance. Then, the test sample was subjected to a heating treatment under the same conditions as those used in Example 9, followed by water removal and drying. After the test sample had been dried, its feeling to touch and the like were not different at all from its feeling to touch and the like before the test. It had thus been fully dried. Furthermore, the test sample was worn and urination was actually effected therein. No leakage of urine was observed. Thus, the urine was absorbed and held in the test sample. During use, no particular unpleasant feeling was experienced. Thereafter, the test sample was washed and dried in the same manner and under the same conditions as those employed above. Its feeling to touch and the like were not different at all from its feeling to touch and the like before the test. N Acryloylpyrrolidine containing 1 of tert butyl peroxy 2 ethylhexanoate was allowed to stand at 40 C for 40 hours to effect solventless polymerization, thereby obtaining a block like polymer. The polymer was ground and its 20 100 mesh fraction was collected as a sample powder. By using 20 g of the sample powder, a diaper like test sample was prepared in exactly the same manner as in Example 3. A test was then carried out in the same manner as in Example 3. Test results are shown in Table 1. Sample powders were obtained by conducting polymerization and grinding in the same manner as in Example 1 except that 403.0 g of N acryloylpyrrolidine, 102.0 g of N,N dimethylacrylamide and 5.1 g of N,N methylenebisacrylamide Example 11 and 397.9 g of N acryloylpyrrolidine, 102.0 g of N vinyl 2 pyrrolidone and 10.2 g of N,N methylenebisacrylamide Example 12 were used respectively. By using the sample powders, drawers like test samples were produced, on which tests were carried out. Test results are also given in Table 1. In Table 1, the test results were evaluated in accordance with the following standards. Sample incontinence drawers were produced in exactly the same manner as in Example 8 except that instead of 25 g of the sample powder obtained in Example 1, was used a mixture obtained by thoroughly stirring and mixing 25 g of the same sample powder and 2.5 g of synthetic polyethylene pulp trade mark SWP product of Mitsui Petrochemical Industries, Ltd. having an average fiber length of 0.9 mm. The inside of the sample incontinence drawers was gradually soaked with 300 ml of human urine. Five minutes later, a hand was pressed on the urine soaked area. The surface of the test sample was dry and no release of urine was observed. The hand was not wetted at all. No substantial changes in its external appearance were observed. Then, the test sample was subjected to washing, water removal and drying under the same conditions as those employed in Example 1. After the test sample had been dried, its feeling to touch and the like were not different at all from its feeling to touch and the like before the test. It had thus been fully dried. Furthermore, the test sample was worn and urination was actually effected therein. No leakage of urine was observed, so the urine was absorbed and held in the test sample. During use, no particular unpleasant feeling was experienced. Thereafter, the test sample was washed and dried in the same manner and under the same conditions as those employed above. Its appearance e.g. to touch was no different at all from its appearance e.g. to touch before the test.
