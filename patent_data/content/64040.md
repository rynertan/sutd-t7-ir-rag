# Therapeutically active disulphide compounds and their use.

## Abstract
Therapeutically active organic compound exhibiting at least one group comprising a structure S S R, wherein the group S R is defined by R being an organic group comprised in a physiologically acceptable compound H S R obtainable by the splitting of the disulfide bridge S S in said structure, in which compound H S R the sulfur atom S is bound to a carbon atom in a heterocyclic aromatic ring in R having a configuration being such that the compound H S R, while maintaining physiological acceptability, is stabilized, by tautomerism or resonance involv ing the sulfur atom S bound to R, so as to be mainly excluded from reaction involving thiol disulfide exchange S being bound to an aliphatic carbon atom and said compound, in addition to the group or groups comprising the structure S S R, consisting of a residue of a therapeutically active organic base compound of non poly peptide structure bound to S . The invention also relates to a method of modifying a therapeutically active organic compound of non polypeptide structure by introducing a structure S S R according to above a method of treating diseases by administration of a compound according to the invention and also to a pharmaceutical composi tion containing at least one compound according to the invention.
