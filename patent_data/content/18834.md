# Improvements in or relating to telephone exchanges.

## Abstract
The availability of service in a telephone exchange is evaluated by a technique which includes monitoring for each call type over a period of time the level of usage of the items of equipment required for that call type and evaluating using the monitored data the probability of each particular item not being able to provide a service when required. The probability figures of the call types can be combined to give an index figure indicative of the availability of service of the exchange.
