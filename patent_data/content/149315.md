# BUOY FOR STORING ROPE CONNECTED TO AN UNDERWATER ARTICLE

## Abstract
A buoy for storing rope connected to an underwater article such as a lobster pot comprises a buoyant casing having two side portions connected together and a reel rotatably mounted between the side portions and carrying a length of rope one or both outer ends of which are connectible to the lobster pot or like article. A central portion of one end of the reel is accessible from a side of the buoy through the adjacent casing side portion, and this one end has a non circular configuration adapted to the engaged by winding means such as a so called pot hauler . The side portions may be connected together by posts, with one of the side portions being held on the posts by removable cotters, so that the buoy can easily be taken apart. An end of rope may be connected to the reel by means of a swivel link so that when the rope is fully paid out the buoy can remain on the surface of the water and can rotate relative to the rope. Alternatively, the reel may have means for connecting it to the central part of a rope which extends between two lobster pots, in which case the buoy holds the rope clear of a sea bed but does not rest on the surface of the water.
