## Description
1,4lBENZODIOXIN AND 1,4 BENZOXAZINE DERIVATIVES The present invention relates to 1,4 benzodioxin and 1,4 benzoxazine derivatives which have histamine H 2 antagonist activity. The invention also relates to processes for the preparation of these derivatives and their salts, to pharmaceutical preparations comprising them, and to their use. Histamine is one of a number of naturally occurring physiologically active substances which are thought to interact with specific receptors. In the case of histamine, there are at least two types one is called the H l receptor Ash and Schild, Brit. J. Pharmac. 1966, 27, 427 , and the other is called the H 2 receptor Black et al Nature 1972, 236, 385 . The action of histamine at the H l receptor, for example, stimulation of bronchial and gastro intestinal smooth muscle, is blocked by the compounds generally known as antihistamines , but which are now also called histamine H l antagonists, for example, mepyramine. The action of histamine at the H 2 receptors, for example, stimulation of gastric acid secretion and heart rate, is not blocked by mepyramine but is blocked by other compounds, for example, burimamide and cimetidine. Histamine H 2 antagonists may be used to treat those conditions resulting from stimulation by histamine of H 2 receptors, either alone, for example, in inhibiting gastric acid secretion and thus treating its sequelae, for example, gastric and peptic ulcers or together with H l antagonists, for example, in allergic and certain inflammatory conditions. The present invention provides compounds of formulaI, which are histamine H 2 antagonists EMI1.1 in which formulaR1 and R2, which may be the same or different, each represents a hydrogen atom, a straight or branched chain. alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, R1 and R2 form a 4 to 8 membered ring which may contain an oxygen atom or another nitrogen atom, which nitrogen atom may have an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms as substituent,X represents an oxygen atom or a group NR4 in which R4 represents a hydrogen atom, a straight or branched chain alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a phenyl group or a phenalkyl group, the alkyl moiety of which has a straight or branched chain and from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkyl, phenyl or phenalkyl group being unsub stituted or substituted by one or more substituents, which may be the same or different, for example, by one or two substituents, especially by one sub stituent, selected from halogen atoms, straight and branched chain alkyl groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, straight and branched chain alkoxy groups having from I to 4 carbon atoms, nitro and trifluoro methyl groups, or R4 represents a nitrogen protecting group m represents an integer of from 1 to 4 n represents 1 or 2 and R3 represents a group of formula II, III, IV, V or VIEMI2.1 EMI3.1 in which formulaeR5 represents a hydrogen atom or a straight or branched chain alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms andR6 represents a hydrogen atom or a straight or branched chain alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a straight or branched chain alkenyl group having from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, or a straight or branched chain alkynyl group having 3 or 4 carbon atoms. In a compound of formula I, when X represents an oxygen atom, R3 preferably represents a group of formula V or VI, and in formula VI, R6 preferably represents a hydrogen atom or a propargyl group. A preferred value for n is 2. Of particular interest are those compounds in which the groupEMI3.2 is in the 7 position, especially when n is 2 and R3 preferably represents a group of formula V or VI as described above. When X represents a group NH, n is preferably 2 andR3 preferably represents a group of formula VI in which R6 preferably repre sents a hvdroaen at om. Again, the groupEMI3.3 is preferably in the 7 position. When R1 and R2 form a 4 to 8 membered ring which may contain an oxygen atom or another nitrogen atom, which nitrogen atom may have an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms as substituent, such a ring is, for example, a pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine or N methylpiperazine ring. 4 may represent a nitrogen protecting group. Such groups are well known in the art and are described, for example, in Protecting Groups in Organic Chemistry,McOmie, Plenum Press, London 1973, Chapter 2, pages 43 to 93, which are incorporated herein by reference, and inProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis, T.W. Greene, J.Wiley Sons Inc. 1981, pages 218 to 287, which are also incorporated herein by reference. It will be appreciated that some of the groups defined per se for R4 may fall within the general definition of nitrogen protecting groups. Examples of nitrogen protecting groups are alkoxycarbonyl and aryloxycarbonyl groups, for example, p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl and t butyloxycarbonyl groups aralkyl groups, especially benzyl and substituted benzyl groups, for example, p nitrobenzyl and p methoxybenzyl groups and alkylcarbonyl groups which may be substituted, for example, by halogen atoms, for example, trifluoromethylcarbonyl groups. Such groups may be removed, if desired, by conventional methods, for example, as described in McOmie and in Greene see above . An example of a suitable method is acidic cleavage, for example, by treatment with hydrochloric acid. The present invention also provides salts of compounds of formula I, especially physiologically tolerable salts, for example, salts with hydrochloric, sulphuric, hydrobromic, succinic, tartaric or maleic acid, also oxalate salts The invention further provides hydrates, and solvates of formula I. It will be understood that the structure given above for formula I is only one of several possible tautomeric and isomeric representations. The present invention includes all tautomeric and isomeric forms of compounds of the general formula I. The term lower is used in the present specification to denote a group, radical or molecule having up to 4 carbon atoms. Any alkyl group in the present specification may have a straight or branched chain.

A phenyl or phenalkyl group R7 in a leaving group L may be substituted by one or more substituents, especially by one substituent, selected from straight and branched chain alkyl groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, especially methyl groups, halogen atoms, straight and branched chain alkoxy groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, especially methoxy groups, and nitro groups. In a leaving group L, when Y represents a sulphur atom, R7 preferably represents a lower alkyl group, especially a methyl group, and when Y represents an oxygen atom, R7 preferably represents a methyl or phenyl group, especially a substituted phenyl group, for example, a mono substituted phenyl group, especially a tolyl group or a nitro phenyl group, for example, an ortho nitrophenyl group. The reaction between compound VII and compound Ila, IIIa, IVa, VIa or VIII and also between a resulting compound IVb or VIb and compound Xa or Xb respectively, is generally carried out in a solvent, for example, an organic solvent, for example, a lower alcohol, for example, methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile, or in a mixture of two or more of such solvents. The reaction is generally carried out at a temperature within the range of from 5 to 750C. Cyclisation of compound IX may be carried out using an acidic medium, for example, aqueous hydrochloric acid and an organic solvent, for example, an alcohol or a tetone especially acetone, at a temperature within the range of from 10 to 500C, especially at room temperature.

To obtain a compound of formula XI wherein X represents NH, a protecting group R4 may be removed from a resulting compound of formula XIa having a protected NH group. The removal of a nitrogen protecting group R4 is carried out in known manner see, for example, McOmie loc.cit. and Greene loc. cit. . The term known is used herein to mean in actual use in the art or described in the literature of the art.
