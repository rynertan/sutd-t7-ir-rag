# Magnetic tape cassette apparatus and magnetic head unit for use in conjunction with such apparatus.

## Abstract
In a magnetic tape cassette apparatus a magnetic head unit 3 comprises a magnetic head 4 which at one side comprises a head face 6 in which a head gap 7 terminates. On each side of the head face tape guides 9, 10 whose radius is smaller than that of the head face are arranged in such a way relative to the head face that the magnetic tape 8 locally contacts the tape guide. The tape guides each adjoin a height limiter at one end, the two height limiters 13, 14 being arranged in such a way relative to the magnetic head that the connecting line 16 between the height limiters is perfectly perpendicular to a plane through the head gap. Furthermore, the apparatus comprises control means for constantly keeping a lateral edge 15 of the magnetic tape in contact with the height limiters during tape transport.
