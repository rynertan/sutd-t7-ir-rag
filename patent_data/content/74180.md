# Valve assembly.

## Abstract
A valve assembly for a container for pressurized fluid comprises a cup 10 for mounting the assembly to a container body, and valve means 14 including a valve housing 12 fitted in the cup. The valve housing is located within the cup by the engagement of internal projections 16 in the cup behind a head 18 of the housing. The cup, the valve housing and the valve means are arranged in one condition of the valve assembly to allow fluid to be passed into the cup and between an exterior wall of the housing and the side wall of the cup for filling the container. The exterior wall of the housing is provided with a multiplicity of narrow grooves 26 which define flow paths 62 for the passage of such fluid and these grooves are narrow in relation to the width of the internal projections, so that they do not impair the locating function of the projections. The grooves extend into a collar 20 on the housing adjacent to the head, and because of their narrowness they provide extra flow paths past the projections which contact this collar, which paths cannot be blocked by the projections irrespective of the orientation of the housing relative to the cup.
