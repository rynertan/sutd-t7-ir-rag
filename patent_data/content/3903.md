# Oxygen scavenger composition, heat generating composition and structure, and their use as an oxygen scavenger or generator of heat.

## Abstract
The invention provides an oxygen scavenger composition consisting essentially of I as essential components, a an alkali metal sulfide, and b at least one oxidation promoter selected from silica, alumina, silica alumina, silica magnesia and inorganic materials containing one of them as a main ingredient and II as optional components, c at least one oxidation promoter aid, and or d a water insoluble or sparingly water soluble, inert filler, and or e water held physically or chemically in the composition. Also provided are a heat generating composition which is an oxygen scavenger capable of scavenging at least 5 ml of oxygen per gram of the composition from air at 20 C during one hour following the commencement of oxidation of the composition and a heat generating structure comprising the heat generating composition enclosed within a film having an oxygen permeability of 0.01 to 50 cc cm². min. .02 partial pressure 1 atm. , the surface area of the film being 0.2 to 10 cm² per gram of said composition. The oxygen scavenger compositions can be used to capture oxygen from within a closed vessel, while the heat generating compositions can be used to provide a required amount of heat to an object to be heated.
