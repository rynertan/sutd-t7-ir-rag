# Cell separation on plates using non antibody ligands.

## Abstract
Plates, rather than particulate material, are utilized to separate cells into various categories depending upon whether the cells contain receptors that bind to non antibody ligands, such as histamine. This method comprises coating a plate surface with ligand complexes, which comprise ligands bound to carrier molecules. The coated plates are contacted with cells, and the unbound cells are removed by force which does not remove all bound cells.

## Description
CELL SEPARATION ON PLATES USING NON ANTIBODY LIGANDS Certain proteins have the ability to bind noncovalently, and with high specificity, to other molecules which are generally called ligands. The term ligand is used inconsistently and can have numerous different meanings. As used herein, the term ligand is used to mean a molecule or substance, other than an antibody, which has the following characteristics 1. A ligand must be capable of binding to some proteinous molecule, such as an antibody, and enzyme, or a receptor which normally exists on the surface of a cell. Such binding may. be non covalent binding.2. Said binding must have a relatively high degree of specificity in other words, a ligand has a much higher affinity for its receptor than for other types of receptors. For example, an insulin molecule will bind to an insulin receptor, but not in any substantial degree to a histamine receptor. One type of ligand binding involves receptors on the surfaces of cells. Mammalian cells have a variety of receptors on their surfaces, such as insulin receptors and histamine receptors. Many such receptors, such as histamine receptors, are proteinous molecules.Other types of receptors comprise e.g. carbohydrates, lectins, glycoproteins. When a histamine molecule contacts a cells, it does not become bound to the cell unless it contacts a histazzine receptor. If this occurs, then the histamine acts as a ligand which is bound by the histamine receptor. This binding reaction activates or promotes one or more biochemical processes which occur inside the cell. After the process inside the cell commences, the ligand may become detached from the receptor, allowing the receptor to become subsequently bound to another ligand molecule. As used herein, the term activator is used to describe a ligand which binds to a receptor on the surface of a cell. This term is not limited, however, to ligands which activate biochemical processes inside a cell the term activator includes antagonists and agonists, as those terms are described below. In addition, the term activator includes ligands which terminate or suppress cellular processes by binding to cell receptors.Histamine Histamine is a biogenic amine with the following structural configuration EMI2.1 Histamine is secreted by various types of cells, and it may become attached to receptors on the membranes of other cells. The attachment of histamines to histamine receptors can cause or aggravate a wide variety of physiological reactions, including vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, secretion of gastric acids, and urticaria l . The term histamine as used herein includes substituted forms of histamine, such as methyl histamine. The effects of histamine may be mimicked by compounds that are referred to as agonists 123. Histamine agonists include 2 2 pyridyl ethylamine, dimaprit, and various substituted histamines, such as nethylhistamine. Histamine agonists mimic the effect of histamine by attaching to histamine receptors. The effects of histamine may be blocked by compounds that are referred to as antagonists 3 . Histamine antagonists include diphenhydramine and cimetidine, which block various effects of histamine by attaching to histamine receptors without inducing the physiological effects caused by histamine. However, at high dosage levels, certain antagonists such as impromidine may cause agonistic effects on certain types of cells. Histamine receptors are believed to be proteinous molecules with molecular weights in the range of 40,000 to 50,000 daltons. They are divided into at least two categories, designated as Hl receptors and H2 receptors 143. Histamine will bind to either type of rece tor. Certain antagonists such as diphenhydramine will bind to and consequently block Hl receptors to a much greater extent than they will block H2 receptors. OCher antagonists, including cimetidine, will bind to H2 receptors to a much greater extent than they will bind to Hl receptors. It is believed that binding of histamine to H2 receptors plays an important role in the activation of gastric secretion. Therefore, H2 antagonists such as cimetidine are commonly used to treat ulcers by reducing gastric secretion 15 . It is believed that binding of histamine to Hl receptors plays an important role in skin hives and bronchioconstriction l6 .It is suspected that other categories of histamine receptors exist, which are not blocked by Hl blockers or by H2 blockers. For convenience, such receptors are referred to herein as H3 receptors. Thren a histamine, histamine agonist, or histamine antagonist molecule binds to a histamine receptor, the reaction is referred to herein as specific binding.By comparison, if histamine which is a somewhat reactive molecule clings or binds to some other part of a cell, a test tube, a filter, or any other surface, such a reaction is referred to herein as non specific binding. Histamine blockers, as used herein, is a generic term comprising histamine agonists, histamine antagonists, and other molecules which are capable of specific binding with a histamine receptor, thereby preventing a histamine molecule from specifically binding to the blocked receptor. A histamine blocker which binds to Hl receptors with greater affinity than it binds toH2 receptors is referred to as an H1 blocker for example, diphenhydramine which is coirmercially available under the trademark Benadryl Parke Davis,Morris Plains, NJ is an Hl blocker.Alternately, an H2 blocker such as cimetidine which is commer cailly available under the trademark Tagamet Smith Saline and French Co. Philadelphia, PA binds preferentially to H2 receptors. Certain diseases are characterized by, and may be caused or aggravated by, imbalances in Hl and H2 receptor density on lymphocytes and other types of human cells. Such diseases include atopic disease 17 , neoplastic disease 18 , histiocytosis X 9 , autoimmune disease 110 , and other diseases 11 .In order to diagnose, study, and treat such diseases it is useful to determine the existence, concentration, and biochemical affinity of H1 and H2 receptors on various types of human cells. Although it has been recognized since 1910 that histamine causes a variety of physiological reactions, research on histamine receptors has proceeded slowly.The majority of histamine research involved detection of physiological responses, such as muscle contraction or vasodilation, which occur when tissue is contacted with histamine 12 . Some research involved the biochemical production of certain molecules, such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate cAMP by cells contacted with histamine 13 . In 1966, it was recognized that mepyramine, when incubated with tissue, blocked certain types of physiological responses but not other types of responses when the tissue was subsequently contacted with histamine. Based upon that result, scientists speculated that at least two types of cell membrane receptors existed, designated as Hl and non Nl receptors 14 . In 1972, it was discovered that burimamide blocked several responses that differed from the responses blocked by mepyramine this led to the designation of H2 receptors 151. Nost of the research between 1972 and 1977 focused upon physiological responses or ck4P stimulation 16 . Starting in 1977, research results began to appear which described histamine receptor analyses that utilized biochemical binding reactions 17 . In 1979, Osband et al reported the separation and partial characterization of Hl and H2 receptors based upon the ability of Hl receptors to bind to DEAEcellulose and the ability of H2 receptors to bind to phosphocellulose 18 . In 1980, Osband et al reported a method, using fluorescent histamine complexes and a flow cytometer, for determining 1 whether a cell contains a substantial number of Hl and or H2 receptors, and 2 the percentage of cells within a population that contain a substantial number of Hl and or H2 receptors 19 . In 1981, Osband et al reported a method, using tritiated histamine which is radioactive , to indicate the number of HI and or H2 receptors on a receptor bearing cell 20 Ligand Binding Ligand binding is the basis for a variety of purification techniques, including affinity chromatography. In this technique, ligand molecules are affixed to the surfaces of solid particles which are packed within a column. A mixture of proteins is passed through the porous material within a column.The proteins which have specific affinity for the bound ligands remain within the column the other proteins pass through the column. For example, histamine molecules can be affixed to agarose or sepharose beads.The coated beads may be packed in a column, and an aqueous solution which contains histamine receptors may be passed through the column. Alternately, the coated beads may be mixed in solution and incubated with the cells. Histamine receptors in the solution become bound to the histamine coated beads, while the other receptors and other molecules do not become attached. By washing and or filtration methods, the unbound non histamine receptors can be separated from the beads and the bound receptors. The bead utilizing methods have been used to concentrate, separate, or otherwise study various receptors whichiwere previously detached from cell membranes or which were mixed in solutions that contained cell membrane fragments 211. In addition, beadutilizing methods have been used to concentrate, separate, or otherwise study viable cells which contain histamine receptors on their membranes 221. However, affinity chromatography and other ligand binding methods which utilize beads or other small particles suffer from several drawbacks in comparison with plates. As used herein, the terms plate or plate surface refer to any solid surface which is not comprised of particulate material. Plate surfaces may be planar or curved, and may be smooth or irregular in surface texture. A plate surface must be of a size which can be seen for example, 1 cm or more in dIameter and is capable of being handled without the use of special equipment such as microscopes. A plurality of plate surfaces may exist on or within a single plate or other device.For example, in a microtiter plate, each microtiter well may be regarded as a plate surface. In general, plates such as culture dishes and microtiter plates tend to be easier to handle, sterilize, and control than beads or packed columns.Plate binding analyses can usually be performed more quickly than analyses using beads. It is more difficult to remove bound cells which are usually the cells of greatest interest from beads than from a plate. For these and other reasons, there are very significant advantages to utilizing plates rather than beads to separate cells. Efforts have been made to separate cells on flat plates by binding antibodies to the plates 23 .The antibodies are created or selected to bind to antigens on the surfaces of the cells. A suspension of cells is contacted with the antibody coated plate, and only cells with the relevant antigens become bound to the antibodies on the plate. However, there are important differences between antibodies and receptor activators. Antibodies are large proteinous molecules with molecular weights in the tens or hundreds of thousands of daltons by contrast, histamine is a small molecule with a molecular weight of only ill daltons. Therefore, a small ligand such as histamine may not be able to extend sufficiently far away from the solid surface to allow it to contact cells in solution.This problem is sometimes mitigated by the use of spacer molecules between the beads and the ligands 24 Another difference between antibody binding and ligand binding relates to the fact that antibodies tend to bind very tightly to antigens antigen antibody complexes normally do not separate until the constituents are hiadegraded in vivo, or are separated by chemical or physical means in vitro. By contrast, a receptor activator may be bound to a receptor for only a brief period, such as a few seconds or less. Many activators dissociate from their receptors fairly quickly, before a cell separation analysis can be coinpleted. This problem is believed to be particularly severe with respect to small activators, such as histamine and acetylcholine, and less severe with respect to large, proteinous receptors such as insulin. For these and other reasons, the cell binding plate techniques that utilize antibodies cannot be converted easily into similar techniques using histamine or other small activators bound to plates. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of utilizing plates to separate cells into various categories depending upon whether the cells contain receptors that bind to small molecular ligands, and to assay kits which untilize this method. We have found that advantageously such a method comprises the steps of a binding a suitable number of ligands, such as histamine or histamine blockers, to a relatively large molecule, referred to herein as a carrier , to form a ligand complex b affixing a suitable number of ligand complexes to a plate surface, c contacting the coated plate with a suspen sion of cells under conditions that allow cells with ligand specific receptors to become bound to the ligand complexes coated on the plate and d removing unbound cells by force which is sufficiently strong to remove unbound cells without removing substantially all of the bound cells.If desired, the bound cells can be subsequently removed by somewhat stronger force for further analysis. Plate which are coated with ligand complexes as described above may be included in an assay kit. The invention provides a method of separating cells, characterised in that it comprises the steps of a contacting a plate surface that is coated with ligand complexes, each of said ligand complexes comprising one or more ligands bound to one or more carrier molecules, with a suspension of cells, at least some of which contain receptors that bind specifically to said ligands, under conditions which allow said ligands to bind to said receptors and b removing, from said plate surface, cells which are not bound to said ligand complexes by utilizing force which is not sufficiently strong to remove all cells which are bound to said ligand complexes. The invention also provides a cell separation device comprising a plate surface coated with ligand complexes as defined in the last preceding paragraph. The invention also provides an assay kit comprising a cell separation device according to the invention and one or more solutions containing one or more molecular species which are capable of specifically binding to one or more of said ligands. The ligands have, for example, a molecular weight not greater than about 1000. To confirm the usefulness of the method, various cell populations which were classified as receptor positive or negative were analyzed for receptor content using a more elaborate technique, flow cytometry.The results of these experiemnts indicate that, 1. a method embodying this invention is capable of isolating receptor positive cells into a population of cells that contain 5 or less receptor negative cells, for all types of receptors analyzed, and 2. the method embodying the invention is capable of concentrating the population of HlR or H2R cells in a population by a factor of at least 4x. The method has several important advantages including 1. It is capable of separating cells using plates rather than packed columns or other devices which utilize small beads or particulates.2. It is capable of utilizing small molecular ligands which are not strongly bound to their receptors.3. The receptor bearing cells are viable after they have been separated from the non receptor bearing cells. After they have been separated from the solid surface, they remain viable, and they have high numbers of functional, unblocked receptors. There now follows a description of embodiments of the invention. This description, which is illustrative of method, and apparatus aspects of the invention, is given by way of example only, and not by way of limitation of the invention. In one preferred embodiment of this invention, histamine and two histamine blockers are utilized to separate cells into the following categories HR cells cells which have histamine receptors HlR cells cells which have Hl receptorsH2R cells cells which have H2 receptorsThese are the categories that are currently of greatest interest to most researchers.It is also possible, using the ligand complexes discussed below, to separate or identify cells in the following categories HR cells cells which do not have histamine receptorsHlR cells cells which have histamine receptors, but not Hl receptors B2R cells cells which have histamine receptors, but not H2 receptorsHlR2R cells cells which have histamine receptors, but not Hl or H2 receptors. Ligand complexes were created by bonding histamine, diphenhydramine an Hl blocker , or cimetidine an H2 blocker to a carrier molecule, human albumin HA . Approximately 50 to 100 histamine or blocker molecules were added to each carrier molecule. As used herein, the terms carrier or carrier molecule refer to a molecule with a relatively large molecular weight, such as greater than about 10,000 daltons, to which numerous ligand molecules may be bound. Carrier molecules may be proteinous, polypeptide, or polymeric molecules, such as albumin, polylysine, or polymethylmethacrylate. The ligand complexes were diluted in phdsphatebuffered saline PBS , contacted with plastic polystyrene plates, and incubated overnight.Excess fluid was poured off it can be stored and reused. The plates are washed twice with PBS, and they are ready for use. They may be dried, if desired, frozen if desired, and stored for later use. If desired, they may be contacted with a substance such as gelatin to reduce the amount of non specif ic binding. A suspension of cells is contacted with the plates. The cells may be suspended in various fluids, such as PBS or various culture media such as RPJ4I 1640. The fluid may be supplemented if desired by various substances, such as one or more blood components, such as fetal bovine serum FBS . The suitability of any fluid or any fluid supplement may be determined through routine experimentation by ,those skilled in the art The cells are incubated in contact with the coated plate for a suitable period of time at a suitable temperature. In the experiments described below, incubation was performed for l hour at 37 C either parameter may be varied if desired.If Åa large volume of suspension is utilized, the incubation period may be tended to allow the cells to settle and contact the plate. The plates are then washed with a suitable fluid, such as PBS, to remove cells. A typical washing series is conducted as follows. PBS at 370C is gently administered to the plate. If desired, the PBS may contain calcium and magnesium, which are believed to promote the binding of receptorpositive cells to ligands. The plate is gently swirled. The PBS is poured off the large majority of cells in that washing will not have substantial numbers of receptors specific for the type of ligand on the plate. For example, if the plate is coated with histamine HA complexes, the cells removed by the first wash will be BR cells if the plate is coated with diphenhydramine complexes, the cells removed by the first wash will be HiR cells. These cells may be analyzed further if desired. Subsequent washings, using warm PBS with Ca and Mg, may be performed if desired. The PBS is swirled on the plate, poured off, and analyzed by a cell counter to determine bow many cells it contains. IÇlen the cell count drops to less than a predetermined value, such as about 5 of the number of cells con tacked with the plate, this series of washings is discontinued. Alternately, a fixed number of washings may be performed. The predetermined value or the number of washings depend upon the subsequent use or analysis intended for the cells for example, if the purpose of the separation is to obtain relatively pure receptor positive cells, a large number of washings may be performed. After the foregoing series of washings is completed, cells which remained bound to the plate during those washings may be removed. This may be accomplished by several means, such as gently scraping the plate with a device having a soft edge, e.g., a rubber spatula. Cold 40C PBS which does not contain Ca or Mg may be used.Vigorous agitation, such as vortexing or spraying liquid in a jet stream may be used. The preferred method may depend on the subsequent use or analysis intended for the cells. The accuracy of the method is related to the fraction or number of non homogeneous cells in the population that is desired, e.g., the fraction or number of HR cells in an HR population. To a lesser extent, the accuracy is also related to the number of desired cells that are washed off in the washing that are discarded. With respect to both factors, the accuracy tends to be somewhat less than the accuracy of more complex methods such as column separation, or FACS. However, the advantage in terms of lower cost, faster performance, and greater simplicity and convenience, greatly outweigh5the disadvantage of slightly reduced accuracy. Several parameters are important to the proper performance of the method including 1. The number of ligand molecules per carrier molecule. This ratio may be controlled by several means, such as varying the ratio of ligand molecules to carrier molecules during the coupling reaction, and varying the incubation period of the coupling reaction. The ideal ligand carrier ratio for a specific. use will depend upon several factors, including the type of ligand molecule, the type of carrier molecule, and the typo of cells being analyzed. In general, if the ligand carrier ratio is too low, receptor positive cells tend to be detached from the plate by gentle washing, which is unde sirable. If the ligand carrier ratio is too high, receptor negative cells tend to cling to the plate, which is also undesirable. The optimal ligand carrier ratio for any specific use may be determined through routine experimentation. In the experiments described, 50 to 100 histamine ligand molecules were conjugated to each albumin carrier molecules.2. The number of ligand complexes per unit area of plate surface. If the concentration is too high, receptor negative cells tend to adhere to the plate, while if the concentration is too low, receptor positive cells tend to become detached from the plate. This concentration may be con trolled by several methods, such as varying the number of ligand complexes that are contacted with the plate, and varying the contact time before the plate is poured or rinsed off. The optimal concentration for any specific use may be deter mined through routine experimentation.3 The composition of the plate. Numerous types of plastic and other compounds with various binding characteristics are known to those skilled in the art. In addition, methods for coating plastic and other surfaces with molecules that have various functional groups are known to those skilled in the art. The optimal type of plate and or coating for use with any specific type of ligand may be deterlained through routine experimentation. EXAMPLESExample 1 Preparation and Fixation of Lymphocytes Human lymphocytes were separated from blood samples collected in preservative free heparin, by centrifugation using Lymphocyte Separation Medium Bionetics LabProducts, Kensington, MD . T cells were isolated by rosetting lymphocytes with sheep erythrocytes. Some of the cells were fixed by suspension in phosphatebuffered saline PBS containing 1 formaldehyde.Fresh cells were used within six hours of preparation fixed cells were stored at 40C until use.Example 2 Preparation of Ligand Complexes Human albumin was dissolved in water 25 g albumin per 100 ml of solution , stablilized by 0.02 X sodium coprylate and 0.02 M sodium acetyl DL tryptophonate Mass. Public Health Laboratories, Boston MA . Varying quantities of histamine dihydrochioride Sigma ChemicalCo., St. Louis MO and a coupling agent, l ethyl 3 3 dimethylamino propryl carbodiimide hydrochloride ECDI Sigma Chemical Co. were added to 5 ml of the albumin solution. During this process, the ratio ofECDI to histamine mg mg was maintained at about 10 1. The conjugation of histamine dihydrochloride to albumin was allowed to proceed for two hours at room temperature. A tritiated histamine tracer NewEngland Nuclear, Boston tA was added to certain batches to enable monitoring of the amount of histamine conjugated to albumin. Following the conjugation reaction, each solution was dialyzed twice against a 300 fold volume of water, and once against a 300 fold volume of normal saline, to remove unconjugated histamine and ECI X. All dialyses were performed for 90 minutes at 40C with a stirrer. The solution was adjusted to a final albumin concentration of 3.3 mg ml in normal saline before use.If desired for storage, the conjugates may be lyophilized and resuspended at a desired albumin concentration, such as 20 mg ml Control human albumin without histamine or histamine blocker was reacted with ECDI and processed in a manner identical to the HAC complexes.Example 3 Preparation of Albumin Cimetidine Complexes 400 l of 25 human serum albumin 100 mg of albumin was mixed with 4.6 ml of PBS. The temperature was reduced to 40C. 200 mg of ECDI is dissolved in the solution, and the solution is incubated at 40C for 5 to 10 minutes. 250 mg of cimetidine Smith, Saline and French Laboratories, Philadelphia PA as dissolved in 750 lN HCI, which was adjusted to pH 7.4 with l N NaOH. The cimetidine and albumin solutions were mixed at room temperature and allowed to incubate for two hours. The mixture was dialyzed twice against distilled water at 40C, and against PBS. The final solution contained 100 mg of albumin in 6.5 ml of solution.Example 4 Preparation of Albumin Diphenhydramine Complexes Human serum albumin as described in Example 1 was diluted with PBS to provide a solution of 5t albumin.2 g of ECDI were dissolved in 2 ml of the 5 solution.1 g of diphenhydramine hydrochloride Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis sMO and 2 ml normal saline were added. The solution was mixed and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 2 hours, then dialyzed twice against distilled water at 4 C, then dialyzed against PBS. The final solution contained about 100 mg of albumin in about 5 ml of solution. Example 5 Binding of Ligand Complexes to Plates Ligand complexes were prepared as described inExamples 2, 3 and 4, above. These complexes were contacted with polystyrene Corning 100 mm tissue culture plates Fisher Scientific Co., Pittsburgh,PA . The plates were incubated overnight. The excess fluid was poured off, and the plates were washed once with PBS. If desired, the plates may be contacted with a solution containing protein, such as a 0.1 solution of gelatin or a 1 solution of bovine serum albumin, which does not contain ligand molecules. The purpose of this step is to coat any exposed plastic surfaces that were not coated by ligand complexes.This reduces non specific binding of cells to the plates.Example 6 Binding of Cells to Plates Cells prepared as described in Example 1, were suspended in RPMI 1640 culture medium, supplemented with 7 heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM calcium, and 1 mM magnesium. The suspension was adjusted if desired by dilution or filtration to a concentration of about 4 or 5 ilion cells ml. The suspension was contacted with plates which were coated with ligand complexes as described inExample 5, at a contact density of about 30 to 60 million cells per 100 mm diameter plate. The plates were incubated for 1 hour at 370C. Several competitive binding reactions were performed as described in the following example reaction. To determine the number of cells withH2 receptors, an excess quantity of an Hl blocker, such as diphenhydramine hydrochloride unattached to protein such as albumin was mixed with the cell suspension. The diphenhydramine became bound to most of the Hl receptors on the cells, leavingH2 receptors exposed. Since the Hl receptors were blocked, only cells with non Hl receptors predominately H2 receptors became bound to the plate.Other experiments utilized an excess of H2 blocker, such as cimetidine, to determine the number of cells with H1 receptors. Alternately, if a ligand complex comprising diphenhydramine is bound to the plate, only cells with Hl receptors will bind to the ligand complexes.Example 7 Removal and Analysis of Cells from Plates A PBS washing was used to remove the large majority of unbound cells from the plates, while leaving the large majority of bound cells bound to the plates. A typical washing procedure was conducted as follows 7 ml of warm 37 C PBS containing 2imam Ca, lin i Mg, and 7.5 fetai bovine serum was added to the plate by pipette. The plate was swirled, and the PBS was poured off. The washing was repeated. The number of cells in each PBS wash was counted by a cell counter. X hen the washing contained less than 5t of the number of cells that had been contacted with the plate, then the washings were terminated.All cells washed off by those washings were regarded as HR cells. The cells were analyzed by flow cyto metric methods described by M. Osband et al, Blood,Vo. 56, No 5 923 925 1980 . Cells which remained affixed to the plate after the PBS washing was completed were removed from the plate by placing cold 40C PBS without Ca orMg on the plate and scraping the plate gently with a soft rubber spatula. These cells were analyzed by flow cytometric methods cited above. The results of these experiments indicate that, although there is a great deal of variation between the numbers of histamine receptors on different types of cells, the method is consistently capable of isolating receptor positive cells into a population of cells that contain 58 or less receptor negative cells, for all types of receptors analyzed. In addition, the method of this invention is consistently capable of concentrating the population of HlR or H2R cells in a population by a factor of at least 4. REFERENCES 1. See, e.g., T..O.
