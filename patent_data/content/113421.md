# AUTOMATIC MACHINE FOR INSTALLING INSERTS

## Abstract
An automatic machine for installing such mechanical inserts as nails, bolts, screws, rivets, etc., is described, which allows the minimization of the effort to be exerted by the operator in installing an insert, while being handier and more practical to use. The automatic machine for installing inserts comprises an active assembly 4 to which a tool bit 5 is connected which cooperates with an insert holding head 2 adapted for connection to an automatically operated supply of such inserts the active assembly 4 and head 2 being associated with a supporting structure and aligned to each other, also provided being a valve assembly 29 which fluidically drives the active assembly 4 . The valve assembly 29 includes means for selectively connecting the active assembly 4 to a low pressure fluid supply and to a high pressure fluid supply.
