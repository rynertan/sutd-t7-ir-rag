## Description
A PROCESS SiD APPARArUS FOR ASSEMBLING ELECTRIC MICROCOMPONENTSON PRINTED CiRCUITS .This invention relates to a process and apparatus to assemble electric microcoRponents, for example the so called chip type elements, which, as well known, are formed of nearly paaallelc ped plates having the two minor bases thereof covered with a metal coating enabling the welding thereof on a printed circuit board.By suitable modifications to be made to the gripping means, it is however applicable to cylindrical microcomponents, such as IvELF components, and active conponents provided with pills, such as SOT components.As well known, these canponents are of extremely reduced size and accordingly are suitable to provide in a highly convenient way circuits of extremely reduced dimensions. However, this inherent smallness thereof makes their handling extremely complicated and expensive. Thus, in the manufacture of even small series, such components would require an automatic assembling on the respective printed circuit boards. Attempts have been already made to provide a machine to preset the desired microcomponents at the desired locations on a printed circuit board. According to this approach, the microcopone.nts contained in magazines as parallel stacks are vacuum withdrawn by a perforated flat withdrawing plate, the holes of which are connected to a vacuum source, said plate moving along a determined path, so as to deposit the withdra n components on the printed circuit board as soon as the vacuum has been released. however, this process suffers from the disadvantage that at a single position of the withdrawing plate more than one microcoii oneW may often remain attached to said plate, thus providing faulty circuits.It is another limitation of the apparatus at present used that the vacuum withdrawing plate directly contacts the printed circuit board, so as to preclude the use of partly occupied boìrd , conprising for exule electric elements previously assembled thereon.It is another disadvantage of the known approach that only microcar ponefts having the same thickness can be simultaneously applied, since these micro orrponents should all come in contact with with the printed circuit plate.Therefore, it is the object of the present invention to provide a process and relating apparatus for assembling microcomponents on printed circuit hoards, providing unexceptionable boards at reduced costs.It is a further object of the invention to enable the use of printed circuit boards having a corsiderable overall size in thickness due to electric elements that have been previously assembled thereon.It is still another object of the invention to enable the simultaneous assembling of microcorjDonents having different thicknesses.Finally, it is another object of the present invention to allow, betxreen the microconponent gripping and supplying steps, the control of the provisions of the desired microcomponents and or also an electric check thereof.The ahove mentioned objects have been accomplished by providing the following operating cycle a at rest condition, the gripping means are arranged near the component located at the free top opening of the respective magazine h the gripping means close by gripping the microconponent placed at the free top opening of each magazine c the gripping means are driven by the associated handling means, still holding therebetween the microcomponent previously gripped thereby, and approach it to the printed circuit board which had been previously provided with glue d the gripping means open, leaving the component on the printed circuit board e the gripping means move back to the origiflaiw position substantially near to the free top opening of each micro components magazine, and f the microcomponent stacks are fed by an amount corresponding to the thickness of the respective component in each stack.An approach of the invention provides that during step a a visual and or electric control can be made for the withdra n microcc i ponents. In this latter case, the gripping means would be at least partially insulated.A preferred enbodiment of the invention provides that the microcomponent arranged immediately beneath the microcomponent located at the free top opening is retained by resilient means, which are hook sha ed, along with the remaining stack portion, thus positively causing the component gripped by the pliers to be separated from the underlying component, that is not allowing one microcomponent to adhere to another microcomponent when a microcomponent is gripped.The relative apparatus for carrying out the above specified process comprises z series of means to simultaneously grip and supply a plurality of microcaT,onents at preselected positions of a printer circuit board on which such microcomponents are to be applied, each of such means being actuated by a control member capable of gripping and releasing the microcomponent arranged at the top opening of each stack making up a magazine a handling means to move said gripping means from. a position substantially corresponding to the free top opening of the microcomponent stack to another position substantially corresponding to the application position for said microcomponent on said printed circuit board and a means to feed said microcomponents along the magazine making up stacks, so as to enable the gradual withdrawal thereof.An approach of the invention provides that each of the gripping means comprise a pliers having two sliding resilient legs and that the control member to open and close each gripping means comprises a resilient cam guide which, in turn, is actuated by a wedge shaped plate, the displacement of which varies the position of said cam guide, within which the gripping means slide.Preferably, resilient hook means are also provided, which hold the microcomponent arranged immediately beneath the component located at the free top opening of the microcomponent magazine, thus avoiding that the withdrawn microcomponent adheres to the adjacent microcomponent. The invention will now be further explained with reference to an exemplary embociiment, which has becr scherstically s ,o1 in t successive operating steps on the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 Is an enlarged sectional view taken along line 1 1 of Fig. 2, showing an apparatus according to the present invention, for tiie sake of simplicity comprising only a reduced number of microcomponent magazines Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along line 2 2 of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a further enlarged sectional view taken along line 3 3 of Fig. ll Figs. 4 through 10 are sectional views taken along line 4 4 of Fig. 3, showing the successive processing steps, the sizes of said views being still on enlarged scale, but different from those of the preceding views andFigs. 11, 12 and 13 are sectional views taken along line 11 11 of Fig. 3, also showing some operating steps, the views being on the sarge enlarged scale as those of Figs. 4 through 10.It will be seen from Figs. 1 and 2 that the apparatus according to the invention comprises a series of magazines containing stacks 10 of microcomponents which are parallel to one another. In the example herein shown, the magazines are twelve, but actually the nu.ner will generally be of some thousands.Said magazines are mounted within a fixed blocs 41 comprising two guide plates 22 and 23 and a plate 24 constituting the control plate for the pliers 12, said plate 24 being operated by a cylinder 25 having a stem 26 coJu cted to plate 24.The magazines are rectangularly shaped and, as shown in Fig. 2, a pair of them are rotated through 900 with respect to the other two magazine . Short of the tol opening 15 of said rn igazine 10 a printed circuit board 20 is placed ald conveftionaily carried by moving means 27. Each of the microcomponent magazines comprises four joined continuous walls which, adjacent to their top opening, are divided into four parts, each of which making up an angled portion lOa, lOb., loc and lod Fig. 3 . Between one angled portion and the other, pliers 12 and resilient members 17 will penetrate.The pliers and resilient members may be differently shaped, and differently positioned, so that the electric microcomponents provided with pins at some parts thereof can be handled by the pliers in those parts where there are no pins. Thus, the microcomponent will not be damaged when being positioned on the plate.Referring now to Figs. 11 through 10, the operation of the apparatus will be hereinafter explained. The component stack has reference numeral 10, the microcomponent arranged in proximity to the top opening of the magazine has reference numeral 11, the underlying magazine has reference numeral 21, while the gripping means has two legs of the pliers 12 having a gripping zone 12a.The two legs of pliers 12 vertically slide to and fro on the axis h A of magazine 10 within a cam guide 13, which is driven by a plate 14 having wedge shaped surfaces conjugated with the external surfaces of the cam guide 13, said plate 14 being also movable according to axis A A direction.The movement of plate 14 is caused, for example as shown inFigs. 1 and 2, by a pneumatic cylinder 28 having a stem 29 connected to said moving plate 14.The microcomponent magazine opens toward the printed circuit board 20 with a top opening 15, which may he at least partially closed by a stop device 16, normally of grate like configuration, as shown in Fig. 2, wherein the several stop devices 16 are secured to a support member 16A. Hereinafter the whole unit will be referred to as a stop grate. The board 20, on which the printed circuit will be provided, will be previously locally covered by a drop of glue 19. Preferably, the glue will be applied by a plug and not necessarily by xerigraphy, so as to allow the use of printed circuits boards on which such electric members have been previously assembled as having some overall size extending also from the board part on which the microcomponents are to be assembledThe gluing cycle for the printed circuit board, the board supply cycle to the component application position and the subsequent board withdrawal cycle, are carried out parallely with the movements relating to gripping and application of said microcomponents on said printed circuit boards.The processing steps relating to gripping and supplying of said components will be as follows The microcomponent 11, which is immediately beneath the stop grate 16, is in the proximity of pliers 12, the latter being open. The cam guide 13, made of resilient material, is so arranged as to close as far as possible the top opening 15, through which the microca . onents can move out. This condition has been shown in Fig. 4.The first movement being carried out is that shown in Fig. 5 when the pliers 12 raise upward and grip the microcomponent 11 by their ends 12a, said pliers 12 being guided by the cam guide 13 which is at retracted position.The next movement is given by said stop grate 16 which laterally moves positioning itself between one top opening 15 and the other so that the microcomponent 11 is enable to exit therefrom, saia position has been shown in Fig. 6.Since the top opening 15 for the first microcomponent 11 is free the pliers holding said microcomponent can be caused to exit, so as to reach the board 20 and then applying said microcomponent 11 on the glue drop 19. This step has been shown in Fig. 7.Prior to said pliers 12 contact the board 20, a visual and or electric control can be effected for the just withdrawn microcomponent 11. For the electric control, partially insflated pliers 12 will be provided. Once the microcomponent has been applied on board 20, the pliers are allowed to spread out. This occurs as soon as said wedge shzped plate 14 is raised, causing said cam guide 13 to move back to its open position, as shown in Fig. 8.Then pliers 12 are caused to reenter within the cam guide 13.This can be readily done, see Fig. 9, since said cam guide 13 is now at open position.As a next step, it is provided that the control plate 14 for the cam guide 13 is lowered again, thus closing said cam guide 13 Fig. 10 at the same time the stop grate 16 moves to close the free top opening 15 of the components.It should he pointed out that some steps of the above described process could be simultaneously or almost simultaneously carried out. Particularly, the step at which the microcomponent 11 is gripped by pliers 12 could be simultaneous with the displacement step of the stop grate, so as to clear the top opening 15. Also the return step of the pliers 12 to the gripping zone could be sinultaneous with the closing step of the top opening 15.In Pigs . 11, 12 and 13 a secjional view is shown as taken perpendicularly to the sectional view shown in Figs. 4 through 10.The iicrocomponents in the respective magazines are here shown as arranged at 9 with respect to the position shown in Figs. 4 through 10. In these fig res, there are shown resilient members 17 providing hooking means 17a at the ends thereof, which can hold the mi crocomponent 21 arranged immediately beneath the end microcomponent which is driven by the gripping means. Linen these resilient members 17 are pushed thanks to the action exerted to the supply end 31 of the microcomponent magazine 10, such members open, as shown in Fig. 12, so that a microcomponent designated by reference numeral 11 is enable to exit.This forward movement of the microcomponents within the relative magazine is accomDlished when the stop grate 16 is again arranged over the top opening 15.From Fig. 13, which is just a sectional view at 900 of Fig. 4, it clearly appear that microcomponent withdrawal occurs while the adjacent cc .ponent 21 is firmly grosped by the resilient members 17, so that any possible sticking thereof is avoided.The feeding movement of the components in the relative magazines can be given by moveable push rods 30 reciprocating through a differentiated adjustable stroke, so as to take into account the different thicknesses of the components. Since the stop grate 16 is provided at such a position as to close the top opening 15, each of the components will be subtly pushed to the correct position, so as to contact said stop grate 16. The push rods 30 may be introduced into the lower end of furhter magazines 32 arranged on the extension of the magazines from which the withdrawal is carried out. In this way it is possible to feed to the supply end 31 of magazines 10 a new microcomponents carried on a tape 33. This has been shown at the right side ofFig. 2, whereas the approach formerly described has been shown at the left side of the same figure. Of course, the components could be also supplied by a positioner feeder. The microcorp.flr ents feeding takes place on passing from the step shown in Fig. 10 to the step shown in Fig. 4. tunis invention embraces all of those detail modifications which may be obvious to those skilled in the art.
