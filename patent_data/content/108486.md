# Preparation of zeolites.

## Abstract
A new zeolite material designated EU 13 has a molar composition expressed by the formula 0.8 to 3.0 R₂O Y₂O₃ at least 10 XO₂ 0 to 2000 H₂ wherein R is a monovalent cation of 1 n of a cation of valency n, X is silicon and or germanium, Y is one or more of aluminium, iron, chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, arse nic, antimony, manganese, gallium or boron and H₂O is water of hydration additional to water notionally present when R is H, and having an X ray powder diffraction pattern substantially as set out in Table 1. The zeolite material is prepared from a reaction mixture containing XO₂ preferably silica . Y₂O₃ preferably alumina and a methylated quater nary ammonium or phosphonium compound, most prefer ably a tetramethylammonium compound.
