## Description
STABILIZED LINEAR LOW DENSITY POLYETHYLENE Description This invention relates as indicated to stabilized linear low density polyethylene compositions. More particularly, it relates to such compositions wherein the stabilizing component is an organic phosphite ester. Still more particularly, it relates to the stabilization of linear low density polyethylene during processing, fabrication and end use, i.e., at elevated temperatures. Polyethylene has in the past been produced by two basic processes. A high pressure process employing oxygen or radical catalysis is used to manufacture low density branched polyethylene. An 7 estimated 10 metric tons were prepared in 1979. A low pressure process is used to manufacture high density linear polyethylene. Each process produces not only a type of polyethylene having its own unique properties, but also many different resins each being suitable for a variety of uses. The density of these polyethylenes is related to the linear character of the polymer chain, the highly linear polymers being more dense because they can pack together more tightly than the branched chain polymers. In 1977 a new third type of polyethylene was disclosed. See Chem. Eng. News, Dec. 5, 1977, pp 21 22. It was described as linear low density polyethylene. Despite its preparation by a process which utilizes relatively low pressures, e. g., the 7.0 21.0 kg cm2,tproduct is characterized by a low density. In this respect it is similar to the low density polyethylene which presently is prepared in very large quantities by the high pressure process. At the same time its structure is linear. In any event this newly available linear low density polyethylene is quite unlike previously known polyethylenes. Its low density, of course, distinguishes it from high density polyethylene this difference, while not notably significant in itself, is reflected by many marked physical and chemical dissimilarities well known in the art.With respect to ordinary low density polyethylene this new linear low density polyethylene is characterized by higher environmental stress crack resistance, higher heat distortion temperatures, and higher impact strength and flex life, along with lower warpage in injection molded and rotationally molded parts. It also possess higher puncture resistance, tear strength and tensile strength in blown and cast films, and superior low temperature flexibility, high temperature tensile strength and stress crack resistance in wire and cable coatings and blow molded parts. Moreover, although the previously known low density polyethylene is quite stable thermally, as shown by its resistance to the development of color upon repeated extrusion, the newer linear low density polyethylene is not so stable. This kind of stability is important because it permits scrap polymer to be reworked and thus avoids a lot of waste. It is, therefore, necessary that linear low density polyethylene be made stable to repeated extrusions in some way or other. It appears at this early stage of development that linear low density polyethylene will be used in those applications in which ordinary branched chain low density polyethylene has been used, e.g., in film and sheet for consumption by food and non food packaging, consumer and industrial bags, and in agricultural mulching. U.K. Patent Specification 1,526,603 shows polypropylene compositions containing a bis dialkylphenyl pentaerythritol diphosphite. These compositions are shown to be quite stable to repeated extrusions in the sense that they continue to be thermally stable after a number of extrusions.Also, the melt index of such compositions remains substantially unchanged after repeated extrusions. Japanese Patent Application No. 1977 91309 Patent Publication No. 1979 25951 shows a polyethylene composition containing a minor proportion of bis 2,4 ditertiarybutylphenyl pentaerythritol diphosphite. The composition is relatively stable to deterioration in air at elevated temperatures 150 C . Commonly assigned pending applicationSerial No. 124,362, filed February 25, 1980 deals with stabilized high density polyethylene compositions. The stabilization is accomplished by means of a small proportion of bis 2,4 ditertiarybutylphenyl pentaerythritol diphosphite. The use of tris nonylphenyl phosphite to stabilize linear low density polyethylene is taught at pages 394 5 of Kirk Othmer s Encyclopedia ofChemical Technology, Third Edition 1981 . The invention here is a stabilized polymer composition comprising linear low density polyethylene and a minor proportion, sufficient to enhance the resistance of said linear low density polyethylene to deterioration, of a pentaerythritol diphosphite. As noted earlier, the linear low density polyethylene may be prepared at a pressure of 7.0 21.0 kg cm2.The temperature of such a process likewise is convenient, e.g., 80 1000C. Somewhat higher pressures and temperatures have been reported. A mixture of 0.085 mol of 1 butene and 0.915 mol of ethylene, for example, is passed over a fluid bed catalyst comprising chromium, titanium and fluorine on a silica gel support. The resulting product is a copolymer of 1 butene and ethylene, commonly referred to as linear low density polyethylene. The pentaerythritol diphosphite conforms to the molecular structureEMI4.1 spiro and EMI5.1 caged wherein R is alkyl, cycloalkyl, phenylalkyl or alkylphenyl. The alkyl group may contain 8 20 carbon atoms illustrative examples include decyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, octadecyl stearyl and eicosyl. The cycloalkyl group may contain 6 20 carbon atoms and includes such examples as cyclohexyl, 2 methylcyclohexyl, 4 n hexylcyclohexyl, 4 n octylcyclohexyl and the like. The alkylphenyl groups generally are 2,4 dialkylphenyl wherein the alkyl radicals are bulky, i.e., branched chain.Preferably they are tertiary alkyl radicals such as tertiary butyl, tertiary amyl, and the like. These tertiary alkyl radicals should contain 4 8 carbon atoms. The structure of the pentaerythritol diphosphite may be either that of the spiro or caged isomers shown above. The spiro isomer is somewhat more stable to hydrolysis and for this reason is preferred for many applications. For economic reasons, however, arising from the ordinary methods of preparing such phosphites, mixtures of spiro and caged isomers are most usually used. The concentration of pentaerythritol diphosphite in the polymer composition herein ranges from about 0.01 to about 1.08. Preferably the desired range of concentration is from about 0.01 to about 0.1 , i.e., 100 ppm to 1000 ppm. The pentaerythritol diphosphites herein can be used in combination with a phenolic antioxidant. Illustrative species of such phenolic antioxidants include esters of 313 ,5 ditertiarybu tyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionic acid such as the stearyl and pentaerythritol esters, 2,6 ditertiarybutyl p cresol, 1,3,5 tris 3,5 ditertiarybutyl 4 hydroxybenzyl mesitylene, 1,1,3 tris 2 methyl 4hydroxy 5 tertiarybutyl butane, etc. Mixtures of two or more of such phenolic antioxidants may be used in particular instances. The amount of such phenolic antioxidant may range from about 0.005 to about 0.58. The polymer compositions of the invention may also contain metal carboxylates such as calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, zinc laurate and the like, and metal oxides such as magnesium oxide and zinc oxide. Other additives may also be present including antistatic agents, slip agents, UV stabilizers, fillers, pigments, etc. The pentaerythritol diphosphites are effective to impart increased color stability to the linear low density polyethylene compositions of the invention. That is, they inhibit the development of color in such polymers under conditions where they ordinarily develop color. This is shown by the data in Table I Polymer compositions containing linear low density polyethylene, 150 ppm of the stearyl ester of 3 3 ,51 ditertiarybutyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionic acid and the indicated in Table I amounts of phosphite are prepared by mixing the ingredients for 1.5 hours in a PK twin shell blender, then extruded seven times through a 19.05mm Brabender extruder at a stock temperature of 215.6 C The extrudate from the first and seventh extrusion are compression molded at 148.90C into 1.52 mm thick specimens for color measurement. The color ratings, made on a Hunter Lab Color Meter, are shown in theTable.
