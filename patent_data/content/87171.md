# Safety system for control of a filter.

## Abstract
Safety system for controlling a filter 10 with an inlet 11 and an outlet 12 for the liquid which is to be filtered and an outlet 13 for the filtrate. The filter 10 is arranged between a liquid treating system 1 9 and a sterile system 18 23 adapted to receive the treated and filtered liquid. A recirculation circuit 14 is arranged in parallel with the filter 10 and connected to the first mentioned inlet 11 and outlet 12 and has means 16, 17 for the supply of an indicator which is not normally allowed passage through the filter 10 . The system further includes a detector 19 for the filtrate, disposed after the outlet 13 for the filtrate, said detector sensing if the indicator has nevertheless been allowed to pass together with the filtrate into the sterile system 18 23 . Preferably the safety system is intended to be used in connection with a hemofiltration system.
