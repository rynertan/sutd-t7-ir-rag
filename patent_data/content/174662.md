# Vehicle running control system.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein is a vehicle running control device having a slip preventing function where a throttle opening degree of an engine is decreased upon occurrence of slip on drive wheels at starting and acceleration to prevent slip, and a running speed control function where a vehicle running speed is controlled to a target value. The control device comprises a common drive source for the above mentioned both functions, a reduction mechanism for generating a drive output reduced discretely by driving the drive source in a predetermined direction and in a reverse direction, and link mechanism 202, 203 for effecting an open close control of a throttle 10 by the drive output. In the running speed control operation, the open close control of the throttle 10 is effected through the reduction mechansim and the link mechanism 202, 203 by intermittently controlling a driving operation of the drive source in the predetermined direction. On the other hand, upon occurrence of the slip on the drive wheels 41a , the throttle opening degree is decreased to prevent the slip by intermittently controlling a driving operation of the drive source in the reverse direction through the reduction mechanism and the link mechanism 202, 203 . Further, the link mechanism 202, 203 is provided with a damper means 15 for damping a repulsive force to an acceleration operating section 30 due to forcible decrease in the throttle opening degree in the slip preventing opera tion.
