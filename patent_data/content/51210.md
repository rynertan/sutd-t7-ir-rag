# Process and apparatus for preparing uniform size spheroidal polymer beads and suspension polymerization product thus obtained.

## Abstract
Spheroidal polymer beads having a uniform size are prepared by polymerizing uniformly sized monomer droplets formed by the vibratory excitation of a laminar jet of monomeric material flowing in a continuous liquid medium containing a suitable suspending agent. For example, a laminar jet of a monomer mixture comprising a monovinyl aromatic such as styrene, a polyvinyl aromatic such as divinylbenzene and a polymerization initiator are subjected to vibratory excitation and the resulting monomer droplets polymerized to yield copolymer beads having a narrow particle size distribution. These copolymer beads can be employed to prepare ion exchange resins having superior properties, particularly in continuous ion exchange opera tions.
