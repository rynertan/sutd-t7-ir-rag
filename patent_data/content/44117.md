# Catalyst.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a nickel containing catalyst composition of high thermal stability and which has out standing resistance to carbon deposition, and is particularly but not exclusively for use in the steam reforming of hydrocarbons. Nickel catalysts formed from coprecipitated materials and homogeneous on a microscopic scale are commonly used for the production of SNG by the low temperature steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbons. Simi lar materials may be used for the methanation of carbon oxides. These processes require catalysts of high activity at relatively low temperatures. Normally, the thermal stability and other physical parameters such as mechanical strength, and abrasion resistance of such catalysts are of secondary importance. The object of the invention is to provide an improved catalyst, which object is met by a catalyst derived from a precursor of approximate chemical composition Niâ‚†Al
