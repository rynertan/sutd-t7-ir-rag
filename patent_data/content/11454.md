# Monitoring circuits, more particularly for monitoring lamp circuits.

## Abstract
An integratable circuit is disclosed for monitoring the voltage across a sensing resistor 16 in series with a load 10 e.g. motor vehicle lights for providing a warning 26 in the event of a failure. A power supply line 28 feeds two reference current circuits 34, 36 in which the currents are both temperature dependent supply voltage dependent. A voltage stabilising circuit 32 supplies the line 28 and has a temperature coefficient such as to offset the changes in a reference current due directly to changes in temperature and in the temperature responsive voltage on the line 28 . A current repeater 42 receives one of the reference currents 34 and provides an output which is dependent both on the reference current and on the potential difference across the sensing resistor 16 . A comparator 50, 52 compares the output with the other reference current 36 and provides an output signal indicating whether the potential difference across the resistor 16 is above or below a predetermined value.
