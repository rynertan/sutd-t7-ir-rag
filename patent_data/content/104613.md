## Abstract
An electrohydraulic control system which includes first and second electrically controlled fully variable hydraulic pumps 18, 20 adapted to be driven by the vehicle engine 16 . In the specific embodiment of the invention herein disclosed, the first pump 18 is coupled to the steering and braking control valves 38, 42 , and the second pump 20 is coupled to the bucket and hoist control valves 48, 50 . An electrically controlled poppet valve 60, 62 selectively inter connects the respective pump outputs. Operator responsive controllers, namely a bucket hoist joystick controller 10 , a vehicle propulsion controller 12 and a steering controller 14 , provide associated electrical signals as respective functions of operator demand. Electrically operated valves 48, 50 control application of hydraulic fluid to the bucket and hoist drive mechanism 52, 54 , and pressure 76, 78, 80, 82 and position 56, 58 sensors are connected to such valves and actuating mechanisms. An electronic controller 90, 92, 94 receives inputs indicative of operator demands, pump outputs, and operation at the hoist and bucket, and selectively controls or modulates the vehicle valves 38, 42 , the pumps 18, 20 , and the hoist and bucket valves 48, 50 for operation at optimum efficiency.
