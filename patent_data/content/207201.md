# Method of monitoring fitting pressure for track links.

## Abstract
The ram pressure applied during fitting of the link is monitored in relation to a predetermined minimum pressure PL, a predetermined maximum pressure PH and a period T representing the time taken to press each link into position. The fitting of the link is accepted as satisfactory if the sum of the times t Momentary increases above the maximum pressure PH due to the presence of burrs or other irregularities are disre garded provided that the sum of the times for which the pressure PH is exceeded does not exceed a pre set limit.
