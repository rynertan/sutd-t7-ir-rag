# Photographic film cartridge assembly and still camera.

## Abstract
Photographic film cartridge assemblies using a disk shaped, rotatable film unit commonly include a cover member which is movable both relative to the film unit and into covering and uncovering relation with a cartridge assembly exposure window. A camera for receiving such a cartridge includes a mechanism for moving the cover member and a mechanism for indexing the film unit. The problem of simplifying and making more reliable the connections between a still camera and such a cartridge assembly is solved by a cover member 14 which is engageable by the camera indexing mechanism 86 for exposure window 64 covering and uncovering movement and which includes engaging structure 88 cooperable with engaging structure 42 associated with the film unit 10 for rotating the film unit 10 in response to movement of the cover member 14 . The camera 100 includes an indexing mechanism 86 for moving the cover member along a path which both indexes the film unit 10 and covers and uncovers the exposure window 64 .
