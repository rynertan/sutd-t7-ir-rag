# Multiple beam cathode ray tube having reduced off axis aberrations.

## Abstract
A multiple beam cathode ray tube having diminished off axis aberrations and a reduced length. A tube 21, 2, 3 having a flat or planar electron beam emitter means 4, 5 , focussing means 8 and deflection means 9 is provided. A novel accelerating means 20 is provided for accelerat ing the emitted beams while causing them to converge towards a crossover point 22 which is located not closer to the screen 3 of the tube than the deflection means 9 . The maximum off axis distance of the beams when trav ersing the focussing and deflection means is reduced, and the off axis aberrations are correspondingly diminished. In a preferred embodiment, the said accelerating means 20 is comprised of the combination of an anode 23 and a field shaping electrode 24 which face each other with surfaces in the shape of curved figures of revolution, re sembiing the mouth of a trumpet.
