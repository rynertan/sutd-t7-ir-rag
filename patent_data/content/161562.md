# APPARATUS FOR MOUNTING, AND FOR MAINTAINING RUNNING CLEARANCE IN, A DOUBLE ENTRY RADIAL COMPRESSOR

## Abstract
A gas generator having a double entry low pressure cen trifugal compressor, a single entry high pressure centrifugal compressor and a radial inflow turbine positioned coaxially and coupled for interdependent rotation by a single shaft assembly for the double entry compressor mounted to the generator frame using a plurality of rigid hollow cross over ducts which also carry diffused compressed air to the high pressure com pressor, where the single shaft assembly uses two shaft por tions connected by an expansible coupling having a helical spline torque transmitting device to allow the double entry compressor rotor to follow compressor housing axial posi tion changer and to maintain a close running clearance despite thermal expansion in the structure between the low pressure LP and high pressure HP compressor portions of the gas generator.
