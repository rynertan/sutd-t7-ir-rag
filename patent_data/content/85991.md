# LOGIC CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A logic circuit provided with a desired hysteresis charac teristic in its input output characteristics is disclosed. The circuit comprises a logic section including a first depletion type field effect transistor operating as a load element and at least one input field effect transistor of an enhancement type, a series circuit of a second depletion type field effect transistor and a switching transistor connected in series with respect to the first depletion type field effect transistor and means responsive to an output signal of the logic section for controlling the switching transistor so as to provide a hysteresis in the input output characteristic of the circuit.
