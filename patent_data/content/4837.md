# A drill boom arrangement.

## Abstract
A hydraulic drill boom arrangement for drifting and tunnelling comprises a boom proper 10 that is universally pivotably carried by a support plate 13 and carries a feed beam 40 for a rock drill 41 at its outer end. Two hydraulic cylinders 16, 17 are coupled between the support plate and the boom and located on each side of the boom so that both cylinders are loaded by the weight of the boom, which makes the boom very stable in all positions.
