# Thin films of compounds and alloy compounds of Group III and Group V elements.

## Abstract
A thin film of a compound or alloy compound of Group III and Group V elements, particularly of gallium arsenide or gallium arsenide compounds, is produced by impinging, e.g. spraying, onto a heated substrate a liquid or liquids compris ing molecules carrying the constituent elements of the desired film. The constituent elements react together on or im mediately above the heated substrate to form the desired compound or alloy compound which is deposited on the substrate in the form of a thin film. The resulting thin films may be used in solar cells and other opto electronic devices.
