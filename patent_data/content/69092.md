## Description
The invention relates to a device to value objectively the concentration and motility of spermatozoa in a sample of Se final liquid, and particularly a device by which in a short time and very simple manner the Doppler effect due to the division of a coherent monochromatic light beam emitted by a polarized Laser is exploited together with the beat of the two electromagnetic waves provided by such division and relating the two sub beams thereby generated and comprising a reference sub beam of light having the original frequency and a sub beam of reflected light whose frequency is different, respectively.An object of the invention is also the process of data resulting from the examination of such sample, beginning from the output signal of a photodetector which is receiving the new beam formed by the rejoined sub beans of light after the passage of same through the optical system of the device. Alphanumerical results are then displayed and or graphically presented on a monitor in relation with one or more samples of seminal liquid, as the device according to the invention is also provided with means for a sequential examination of the samples which may be fed automatically.The examination of seminal liquid has attracted from many years the attention of searchers and particularly doctors and technicians to provide a device suitable to study and solve problems which are relating particularly to the male sterility. On the ground of experi7mental results the at ten tion has been devoted particularly to the evaluation of concentration and motility of the spennatozoa contained in a sample of seminal liquid. In accordance with the most recent studies it is accepted generally that such evaluation gives a reliable reply to the problema of sterility or fecundity of the male, even by intermediate evaluations, so that the doctor may take part according to the obtained results and desired finalities.Concentration and motility of spermatozoa in a sample of ejaculated seminal liquid have already been and are also to day observed by a microscopic way with the purpose of deducing the respective values. Obviously, only subj ective evaluations may be deduced in this manner which cannot be considered as effectively reliable in the field of analysis recalled hereabove when it is taken in account that the concen 3 tration range of spermatozoa is of tens of millions cm3, so that an evaluation by this method is really problematic also when a rough estimate is desired in a sample of seminal liquid observed by a microscope the spermatozoa appear with different characteristics of motility, either in regards to the velocity of motile spermatozoa and in regards to the direction of movement of each spermatozoon.Further referring to the motility it is indeed to point out that the velocity of spermatozoa may be O for a part of same and is rising to a maximum, middle, minimum value for many others, the spermatozoa being movable in many different directions, also opposite each other.In place of a subjective examination by a microscopic obser ovation, an objective examination has been proposed particularly in the last years, in order to obtain results which are really independent from a personal evaluation and available in a relatively short time, comprising also the pre paration of the sample, compared with a microscopic examination, a time of some declines of minutes being necessary in this latter case.When the prior subjective examination is replaced by an objective examination it is evid ently possible that the desired measurements may also be performed by not qualified operators, a further advantage being consequently added to the main advantage relating to the objective examination.Studies and experiments to value objectively the concentration and motility of spermatozoa in a sample of seminal liquid, in order to deduce reliably the capacity of fecundation of the male who has ejaculated such seminal liquid, have been directed principally to a physical method to determine the influence that a sample to be examined may have on the Pre quench of a beam of light incident thereon and particularly the frequency variation of the light which is diffused after the beam has passed through the sample, in comparison with the original frequency of the beam of light incident thereon.On the other hand, as said before, the spermatozoa observed by a microscope appear with different characteristics of velocity, evidently in accordance with the movement of each one towards the ovule to be fecundated. That is to say, there are motionless spermatozoa as well as sparmatozoa having a low or high velocity, their capacity of fectuidation being eonse quently different.According to the latest laboratory studies the distribution of spermatozoa velocity may be considered as follows EMI4.1 wherein v velocity of the sperm atozoon p v density of relative probability at velocity v vc characteristic velocity of the family 6f sperma tozoa being examined The characteristic ity v is a parameter suitable to C represent the behaviour of the examined sample of seminal liquid in its whole with the most representative velocity in the family of spermatozoa, the value range of which isz generally from 20 to 50 ym sec. On the other hand, the characteristic velocity vc is deducible by performing practically the physical method cited above and deriving the fre quency spectrum due to the Doppler effect through the frequency variation of the light diffused by the sample being examined in respect to the original frequency of the light incident thereon. The frequency spectrum in semi log coordinates is indeed a straight line with a slope the inverse angle of which is equivalent directly to such characteristic vc while the spectrum area represents a quantity which is only proportional to the number of motile spermatozoa. As recalled above, the Doppler effect is the base of the physical method most applied to day for a reliable examination of seminal liquid in order to value the concentration and motility of spermatozoa, i.e. the capacity of the sperm to fecundate the ovule and is generally represented by the following formula EMI5.1 wherein c velocity of the light v velocity of motile spermatozoa O di Busion angle i.e. the angle between the dire tion of incident light and direction of diffused light angle between the outer bisectrix of o and the di rection of velocity v of motile spermatozoaIt is possible to note that in the formula 1 relating to the Doppler effect, as it is preferred to day for the exa ruination of seminal liquid according to the cited physical method, the difference between the velocity of the light c 300,000 km sec and the velocity of spermatozoa v some few Fm sec is so great that the provided frequencies B and ò which relate to the light diffused from a sample being examined and the light incident thereon, respectively are nearly equal so that a beating phenomenon is generated. On the other hand it is to be pointed out that in order to embody practically the physical method preferred for the analysis, beams of light which are relating to reference light with a frequency 20 and diffused light of the sample with frequency B have been generated by the initial division of a single coherent beam of monochromatic light emitted by aLaser.That is to say, two divided sub beams are generated to be rejoined together successively as a single new beam of light the frequency of which is the mean of the two, na 7 mely f fo 2, while the modulated amplitude corresponds to the difference, namely f fO . Such a single rejo ned beam of light has then been analysed by electronic way according to the actual techniques to examine objectively a sample samples and visually display the reliable results obtained thereby.As the spectrum due to the Doppler effect is a straight line in a semi lo system of reference coordinates, with a certain slope in respect to same, an electronic apparatus has ien provided which is suitable to value the concentration and motility of spermatozoa in a sample of seminal liquid being examined and consequently deduce a reliable evaluation of the capacity of the male who has ejaculated such seminal liquid to fecundate an ovule.While above physical method is applied as also suggested at present by searchers and skilled in the art, it is to be pointed out that the advantages of such application are actually attenuated principally because of the following important factors a very remarkable and expensive sizes of the sugge steer designed and manufactured devices based on the Dop pler effect, so that they cannot be considered suitable from the constructive and employment points of view, par ticularly when routine analysis of semen are to be car ried out b the componeS members of the optical system to provide re flections and refractions of the coherent beam of monochro matic light emitted by the Laser, as well as the beam di vider to solve above formula 1 require a particular at tention also in regards to their constructive features as the glass surfaces of respective component members are to be actually suitable to well carry on their functions c the data processing which is beginning from the signal due to the rejoined beam of light comprising the two sub beams originated by the divided original beam of light emitted by the Laser the first one still having the ori ginal frequency f and the second a frequency f rela 0 ting to the diffused light of the sample its performed by means of dimensionally encumbering electronic apparatus the use of which is generally different from the data pro cessing of the examined sample samples spectrum analyser . Furthermore these processors do not give directly the de sired useful results.A main object of the invention is to provide a device for the examination of one or more samples of seminal liquid in a sequential predetermined manner, such device comprising a polarized Laser of a low optical power to be energized for emitting a coherent beam of monochromaticc light direc ted to an optical system, such Laser being mounted on a pla ne of a box container wherein the optical system is enclo sed, the box container being relatively small sized and the refore easily transportable to the place where the device is to be used an optical system which comprises substantially reflecting and or refracting component members to divide the original coherent beam of light emitted by the Laser in twp sub beams, a first sub beam having the original reference fre quency and a second sub beam the frequency of which, while being like the original frequency when such sub beam is incident on the sample to be examined, provides an output diffused light with a different frequency after having pas sed therethrough, as such second sub beam is influenced by the characteristics of the sample.The two sub beams are then rejoined together as a single new beam of light which however generates a beating between the respective electromagnetic waves because of the very small difference between the frequencies of the first and second sub beams. Another object of the invention is to make use of an optical system which, besides to be containable within a box contai ner of relatively small sizes and therefore easily transportable, is provided with component members the operative surfaces of which do not require any special treatment as they are of a conventional and easily found type. These component members are only provided with blackened covers having small openings which are sufficient for the desired effects, so that those eventual interferences of secondary radiations which could be possible because of the relatively big thickness of the glass are avoided. A further object of the invention is to provide a suitable support unit for one or more mini test tubes containing samples of seminal liquid to be examined, such support unit comprising a part with thermostat in order to keep the sample samples at a desired temperature, such part being solid for the box container structure, and a part which in turn comprises movable sections to be controlled for longitudinal and transversal movements in respect to said fixed part, so that one or more of the samples to be examined may be placed sequentially in its right position or removed therefrom.Another object of the invention is to give to the operator the possibility of observing by a microscope the sample du ring the examination of same by the device. Such an observa tion, while not being indispensable, is to be considered useful and performed by means of a microscope properly mounted on a support which is solid for the box container structure.Another object of the invention is to provide a processor of the data resulting from the signal emitted by a photodetector of the device and referred to the rejoined beam at the output stage of the optical system. The data processor according to the invention is properly programmed to display also visually the alpha numerical results and or graphic diagrams relating to a single sample or a set of samples which are examined consecutively. This processor is also of relatively small sizes and connected with the device in such a manner that may be mused easily to deduce the characteristics of the examined seminal liquid, namely the total number of spermatozoa, the number of motile sper matozoa and the motility of same, such characteristics being also displayed as graphic diagrams.To improve the operative possibilities of such data processor a first component member is provided which is a photodetector placed directly within the box container of the device in order to detect the modulated amplitude at the low frequency B PO , the variability of this latter being generally from O to some few hundreds hertz. The output signal of the photodetector is then directed to the other component members of the data processor.On the ground of above considerations, the velocity of motile spermatozoa contained in a sample of seminal liquid to be examined is generally different from one spermatozoon to the other, as evidenced when the same sample is subjected to the same sub beam of incident light resulting from the division of a coherent beam of monochromatic light emitted by theLaser. That is to say, all the output diffused light of an examined sample does not have like frequency previously indicated whits character f in formula 1 .The light diP fused by the motile spermatozoa in its whole has by itself a frequency spectrum between a minimum mien fo relating to spermatozoa with velocity O and a maximum fmax relating to the spermatozoa which are the most motile in the population of the sample. On the other hand, aXso the signal which is resulting from the beat between the electromagnetic waves of diffused light and light emitted by the Laser has a frequency spectrum from O Hz to fmaX fo Hz the intensity of the several components of the spectrum being proportional to the number of spermatozoa whose velocity v corresponds to such frequency.The electronic circuit system according to the invention is programmed to precess the data due the output signal of the photodetector and carries substantially on the following functions 1. amplification of such signal 2. spectral analysis of the amplified signal by FFT Fast Fourier Transform 3. processing of the characteristic parameters of the seminal liquid contained in the sample 4. display of results as alpha numerical results and or graphic diagramsTo confirm what has been worded hereabove it is further to be added that, in accordance with the most recent experiments the characteristic parameters of the examined seminal liquid concern a. the total number of spermatozoa anyhow they are present in the sample, such number being proportional to the in gral of the resulting spectrum, i.e. proportional to the diffused total optical power b. the number of spermatozoa having velocity 0, i.e. a velo city which cannot influence effectively the useful results because of its very low value such number is proportio nal to the integral of the spectrum from a frequency O to a frequency having a predetrmined minimum value c. the distribution of velocities p v and particularly the velocity vc cited hereabove, which is considered as the characteristic velocity the values of which are derivable from the frequency spectrum in respect to the frequency. Fm the previous statement, the skilled in the art may already form an idea of the novel characteristics of the invention for what concerns the constructive features and easy use of a device according to the invention, as well as the possible quick examination of one or more samples of seminal liquid and a clear display of reliable results. The advantages in respect to devices or apparatus of prior art having like fi nalities may then be deduced easily.In order to better value the mentioned novel features of the invention and the advantages which are deriving by the use of this novel device, a description is hereafter reported which is referred to the accompanying drawings and concerns an example only of a preferred embodiment and not a limitation of same. It is also to be pointed out that, while the description and drawings are particularly related to the examination of human seminal liquid, the application based on the principles of the invention is to be considered as extended to the examination of seminal liquid of animals when the different characteristic parameters of these latter and even the differences between the parameters of bovine, equine or porcine animals are taken into account.This possible application of the invention in the zootechnic field is here emphasized because the artificial insemination of animals is already put into practice commonly and is also put into common practice the sale of animal sperm. In spite of remarkable prices of sale the buyer does not have however any security about the 1,good quality of the purchased sperm, that is to say, about the fecundation capability of same neither from the biological or commercial point of view, so that it is not at all impossible that the sold sperm has characteristics of reproductivity actually insufficient. The use of a device according to the invention may then be an e ècti ve and objective aid also in the zootechnic yield. The description of an embodiment of the invention is ref er red to the accompanying drawings and relates to a preferred example of the novel device to be used for the examination of human seminal liquid.In the drawings fig. 1 is a schematic block view of the optical system pro vided for a device according to the invention, wherein a coherent beam of monochromatic light emitted by a Laser and the division of same in two sub beams having the ori ginal frequency and the frequency of diffused light, re spectively,are shown to provide the Doppler eFfect as well as the beating phenomenon, the output signal of such op tical system being then processed electronically fig.2 is a schematic elevation view of a partially uncovered box container structure containing the optical analysis sy stem, a support unit for sample samples of seminal liquid to be examined and the first component member of the data processor, namely a photodetector the output signal of which is transmitted to the other components of the processor fig.3 is a schematic elevation view from one of the outer si des of the box container fig.4 is a schematic elevation view as a detail of the support unit of sample samples to be examined fig.5 is a schematic top view of the support unit of fig.4 fi5z.C is a schematic view of possible secondary radiations reflected by an optical component, particularly vhen the surface thickness of same is remarkable, the cover of com ponent members of the optical system being blackened and provided with openings which allow the passage therethrough of only or nearly only the main reflected and refracted rays fig.7 is a block diagrcun of the electronic system to process the data transmitted by the rejoined beam which is zooming out from the optical system, in order to deduce and display alphasnumerical results and or graphic diagrams on the ground of which the evaluation of the sample characteri stics may be considered figs.8 to 11 are circuit details relating to the main compo nents of the electronic system in accordance with the inven tion. Turning now to the drawings and first of all to fig.l, a block diagram is shown of the device component members according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. The component members are operating in such a manner that when aLaser 12 is energized to emit a coherent beam of monochromatic light A it is after all possible to draw out a final rejoined beam A7 to be passed to a photodetector 51 the oust put signal of which is analysed by electronic way in order to value the results. These results may be presented preèra bly as alpha numerical results and or diagrams when a sample of seminal liquid is placed suitably on a plane 18 of a SUp port unit of the device for being analysed in accordance with the principles evidenced in the premises.From the schematic block view of fig.l it is indeed possible to point out that the beam of monochromatic light A emitted by Laser 12, after being reflected as Al through the optical component member indicated by the wRience numeral 14, is at once subjected to a division by means of beam divider 15 in order to draw out a first reference sub beam A2 having the original frequency fO, as well as a second sub beam A4 coming out from divider 15 after its refraction in A3 through optical component member 15 and its reflection through optical component member 15 .The scope of the division of reflected beam A1 in two sub beams A2 and A4 may be easily understood by seeing the schematic block view of ì.1, wherein such second sub beam A4 is acting on the sample Sc when this latter is placed suitably on a plane l8 of support unit 20 see figs.4 and 5 in order to be analysed in accordance with the principles of the invention.Further in accordance with the schematic view of fig.l, beam light A4 incident on sample Sc will be subjected to diffusion because of the characteristics of this latter. In order to value reliably the results obtained by exploiting the Doppler effect, the examination of diffused light AS has been preèr red along a direction which gets out 8 to lOC only from the direction of sub beam A4 incident on sample Sc being examined.An examination along a diffused light direction within larger angles is however possible.A component 17 of the optical system comprising members 17 and 17 gives rise to reflecting and refracting effects, so that a beam A6 is provided by member 17 and properly dire ted to member 17 in order to be joined with the first sub beam A2 at its output therefrom. As desired, a final rejoined beam A7 is thus formed with a beating phenomenon generated by the two electromagnetic waves relating to the original frequency f0 of sub beam A2 and frequency f of the light diffused by the examined sample Sc. Such a final beam A7 is passed to the first component 51 of a processor, namely a photodetector, to evidence the beginning of data processing from the output signal coming therefrom. As premised, the motion frequency of the spermatozoa may range from a value O to a maximum value Pm the motion of the spermatozoa having different directions. On the other hand, the motion velocity is rather limited, particularly when referred to the light velocity. As also premise, a beating phenomenon is to be generated in order to obtain those comparisons from which the necessary evaluations may be deduced by spectroscopic way and exploiting the Doppler effect. According to the preferred embodiment of the invention , a device 10 is provided the most important component members of which are shown in figs.2 and 3.The skilled in the art may remark that the manufacture of such a device is relatively easy and inexpensive, also because of the relatively small sizes of same. Moreover such a device may be operated by not qualiìed operators. Real advantages are also deriving from the reliable results which are obtainable by the processor, with video display of same as alpha numerical results and or graphic diagrams. One or more samples of seminal liquid contained in mini test tubes may be placed on the plane of a suitable support unit of device 10 to be examined sequentially.Turning now to the drawings of device 10 and particularly to figs.2 and 3, it is first of all to be evidenced a novel eha racteristic relating to Laser 12, namely the use of a He NeLaser red light of the polarized type either to provide the desired division of the emitted beam of light and exploit theDoppler effect, and to use at least a part of optical component members without a previous treatment of their reflecting or refracting surface. Obviously, the possible use of component members of the optical system without a previous treatment of their surface is by itself to be considered as a further novel characteristic of the device according to the invention.According to fig.2, Laser 12 has its ignition electrode connèc ted to an electric source by a cable 13. The Laser is mounted between support members 12 and 12 so that it may rotate about its axis ana in order to reach the most favourable operative and constructive conditions of the optical system of device 10, as recalled above. An optical power of 1 to 5 mW for practical applications according to the invention may be considered sufficient. rhe optical system of device 10 is actually enclosed within a box container 11 provided with a main cover 11 . A support unit 20 is also enclosed within box container 11 on the plane 18 of which one or more mini test tubes may be leaned and fastened, which contain the seminal liquid to be analysed.To one side of box container 11 the Laser 12 may be placed and fastened, while to the opposite side a support 21 for a microscope 22 is provided, also the obj ective of this latter being placed within box container 11 to give to the operator the possibility of following the analysis phase of each sample Sc of seminal liquid by a direct microscopic observation, when this is desired and or considered of some importance.In figs.l and 2 it is evidenced that the optical system for the division of the beam of light emitted by Laser 12 and exploitation of the Doppler effect in order to reach the finalities pointed out in the premises, is actually vey simple and provided with component members 14,15 15 , 17 17 which are acting consecutively to generate the reference beam A2 having the original frequency ò and the final rejoined beam A7 with photon beating. As said above, a novel characteristic of the selected optical system which is coupled well with tha novel characteristic relating to the polarization of Laser 12 concerns the avoidance of a conventional treatment in regards of at least a part of the operative surfaces of its component members.In fig.2 a further important novel characteristic of this optical system is provided, namely the radial limitation of incident or reflecting beam, the scope of which is to avoid as much as possible the negative or disturbing influence of secondary reflecting or refracting beams or rays the presence of x hich may be possible when the glass thicicness of optical component members is relatively considerable as in the case of embodiment according to the invention.While well known, the presence of these secondary rays r2, r3, r4...together with the main reflected ray rl of a ray r incident on the outer surface of a glass b has been schematically shown in fig.6, to better detail the importan ce to be attached to the provided opening d in the case of optical component member 15 and still better to the openings d1 and d2 of component member 17 , because these latter con cern separately the incident beam AS and the reflecting beamA6 which is consecutively refracted by the outer surf ace of component member 17 .The component optical member is covered by a blackened thin plate to protect it against a general passage of light, as the passa ee of the light is possible only through said properly provided openings d or d1 d2 The description of the optical system of device 10 is now continued to point out that a component member 16 is inter posed along the direction of reference beam A2, such component member 16 comprising a grey filter to attenuate the luminous intensity of beam A2 when necessary for balancing pur poses between beams A2 and A6 a diffusion angle G is previous ly selected for such beam of light which is conveyed through said opening d1 relating to component member 17 after having struck the sample Sc placed on the support plane 18 of support unit 20.As said above, according to this embodiment the angle O has been supposed of about 8 to 100 without any limitative purpose for the invention, but only to indicate a preferred value for the examination of a sample according to the formula 1 of the Doppler effect. A particular attention is to be paid to support unit 20 which is schematically shown in fig.2 and detailed in Pigs.4 and 5. It is possible to understand that such support unit 20 is provided in device 10 as solidly connected thereto to support one or more samples of seminal liquid to be analysed.A fixed portion 27 of same is provided with a thermostat gene rally regulated at 3700 in order to keep in the most suitable conditions the sample samples to be analysed, while portions 28 and 18 may be controlled to be moved along two directions perpendicular to each other, as it may be seen in figs.4 and 5.As recalled above, the consecutive examination of one or more samples of seminal liquid enclosed in respective mini test tubes is possible by using device 10. When at the moment the examination is referred to one sample only enclosed in a minitest tube Sc see fig.5 , it is to be added that the part 28 of support unit 20 which may be moved along the direction perdicular to the plane of the drawing, i.e. across device 10, is guided by swallow tailed grooves provided in the fastened part 27 wherein a thermostat is placed 4not shown . It may be of some interest to icnow that these mini test tubes containing the seminal liquid to be examined have preferably a length of about 30 to 40 mm and a cross section shaped rectangularly one side of which is about O,1 to 0,4 mm high and the other 1 to 3 mm vide. The. across displacement of such movable part 28 is then to be considered limited to the initial regulation only in order to define the position which is suitable either for the incidence of beam A4 thereon and the easy obser vation by the microscope. To place rightly a sample Sc for the examination, a shoulder 29 is also provided on plane 18 of sup port unit 20.Such plane 18, while mounted in movable part 28 to follow the cross displacements of this latterrmay also be moved independently in a longitudinal direction along guides 18 , so that after all the operator may move as desired the part 18 either to place and fasten the mini test tubes Sc thereon by means of conventional elastic thin plate 30 and remove same therefrom at the end of the examination, as sui table motions of movable part may be performed along the one or other opposite direction indicated by the arrows.A pushing element 31 is also provided to fasten plane 18 at the one or the other of its end positions, place a sample rightly for the examination, as well as translate from the one to the other end positions such a movable plane, this element 31 being provided with a teeth 32 to be in turn fastened against a support 32 and moreover controlled by means of a further element 33. A handle 34 is also provided which is to be controlled by the operator to perform easier and as desired the displacement of the sample supporting plane 18.As premised and then confirmed at the beginning of the description, when a device 10 is used in accordance with the invention, the results of analysis of one or more samples of seminal liquid are electronically processed to draw out the desired conclusions which are displayed as alpha numerical results and or graphic diagrams. The electronic circuit system concerning such data processing is described hereafter and referred to figs. 7 to 11 of the accompanying drawings.As also premised, the operator may however follow the examination of sample samples by a microscopic observation. In fig.2 it is particularly possible to see that a microscope 22 is mounted on a support 21 which is fastened solidly to box container 11 of device 10 thrqgh a fixed part 25. The microscope is mounted on its support 21 with the axis dire ted to the sample Sc and falling in with beam A4 incident thereon, in order that the direction of observation through microscope 22 may be suitable to reach the desired finalit. A slightly modified direction of observation is however possible when considered of some importance by the operator. For this purpose the tubular member of microscope 22 is inserted within a support member having an outer spherical surface 23 which in turn is movable between planes of support 21. These latter are thus acting as tangential planes on said spherical surface 23.Further modifications may concern, for example, an auxiliary lighting device, as well as the substitution of the eye piece of the microscope by a suitable telecamera, one or both these modifications being obviously of some importance when a better observation is to be carried out. l urning now to the data processing referred to the results of the examination of sample samples Sc and starting from the beating phenomenon evid enced through the rejoined beam A7, a processor is provided according to the invention. An example of electronic system for such data processing and display of definitive alpha numerical results and or graphic diagrams is shown in block diagram 50 of fig.7, while details of the main component circuits of same are shown in figs.8 to 11.As stated above, a photodetector 51 while being a component of electronic system 50, namely the first component of same, is enclosed within box container 11 of device 10, not only for a better convenience, but also and principally to provide an output signal due jo the incidence of beam A7 and beat provided therethrough. Such output signal is then passed to the other components of processor which may complete their functions and display the results of the examination as desired.As shown in fig.8, the component 51 of electronic system 50 actually comprises a photodiode of PIN type and a pre ampliPier ICl.It is indeed to be recalled that both sub beam of light AS diffused by a sample Sc after the beam of light emitted by Laser 12 has been divided, and the rejoined beam A7 are very faint. The use of a very sensitive photodiode of PIN type with the next pre amplifier TCl gives the possibility of an output voltage sufficient to be conveyed to the data processor through a shielded cable, also when the processor is placed at some distance from device 10.As shown in fig.8 the output signal of pre ampliPier ICl is furthermore amplified and filtered by a band pass filter from 0,1 to 300 Hz, by means of integrated circuits IC2, 1C3, so that any noise of pre ampliPier IC and photodiode PIN may be eliminated.From the experiments of the Applicant it has been possible to deduce that the analysis system must have a dynamic of at least 90 dI3 to abridge the variations of intensity which are eventually presented by a signal to be analysed,when the examination is performed by passing from a pathologic to a normal sample of seminal liquid The components indicated with reference numerals 52 and 54 in fig.7 allow to reach sut dynamic. Component 54 is in effect an analtFto digital converter of 11 bits 1 of sign and by using same a dynamic of 20 log 211 66 d3 is reached. The remainder 24 dB are added particularly when the signals are very faint, the amplification of same being provided by a variable gain amplifier in dicated with reference numeral 52 i2.b Lock diagram of fig.7 and comprising integrated circuit IC4.Such amplifier is programmable by digital signals GO, Gl which in turn act on com as nent 53 control circuit of variable gain amplifier 52, so that the regulation on the basis of said signals may be performed and converter 54 may operate with its best dynamic characteristic.In circuit section of fig.9 it is possible to see that the signal coming out from the circuit mentioned hereabove is fed to a four comparator unit after having passed through a buffer Ices, such a unit comprising the integrated circuits 1C6, 1C7, IC8, 1C9 which have fixed levels of voltage. To start the exponential analysis the operator acts on the starting push button 66 provided on the control panel. The integrated circuit IClO stores then the maximum intensity of the signal according to exponential values 1 21 22 23 and overflow for the duration of 10 seconds controlled by a timer ICll, after which said signals GO, Gl are obtained by a suitable decodification. After such stated time interval of 10 sec a pulse ESP of 10 msec is generated by the inte p grated circuit IC12 to point out that the exponential signal has been computed.According to the circuit detail of fig.10 the output signal of variable gain amplifier 52, the mean value of which is O because of the effect of band pass filter, is added to a continuous component equal Vr 2, where Vr is the predetermined reference voltage of 10 V. Such compound signal will never have the value O or a voltage like the reference voltage Vr because of the compression of vrial le ain amplifier 52.From the circuit detail of fig. 10 it is also possible to note that the signal, after its passage through an integrated circuitICl3 having sample and remember features, is continuously compared with the output of a digital to analog converter of 12 bits by means of integrated circuit ICl5, such converter comprising the integrated circuit ICl4, output date D of integrated circuit 1015 being passed to integrated circuit 1018 forming a register of the sequential approssimation type,of 12 bits.When through such comparison a result of equality is coming out, an output signal date of 12 bits is obtained together with a validation signal Ready Date D from the p integrated circuit ICl8, to be passed to interface circuit A D indicated by the reference numeral 55.As premised, the maximum signal frequency of 300 Hz is pre vided. 1 he sampling frequency will have a double value. From the circuit detail of fig. 10 it is also possible to notice that an oscillator 1017 is provided which is suitable to give a frequency f 3,900 Hz i.e. equal to 13x300 Hz 0 where 13 12 bits 1 Ready Date DD A special signal Ab from the control component 53 of the amplifier and exponential helds the analog to digital converter stopped at the output value o during the presentation time interval of 10 msec relating to the exponential. According to the circuit detail shown in fig.11, the exponential of the signal which is converted to a digital date is 5UC cessively presented to the low section of the gate P3 of an integrated circuit IC22, while the high section of such gate P3 is put to the value O through the integrated circuitIC20. The whole operation is carried out in the time interval of 10 msec of the Exponential Ready signal indicated with refe rence characters ESP The data are presented successively to the gate A of integrated circuit IC22 and high section of gateB of same, together with a bit of the low section, i.e. a total of 13 bits 12 bits of the signal 1 bit high fixed , while the remainder is put to 0.An output pulse from integrated circuit ICl9,the duration of which is 45 usec, misdirected to a microprocessor 56 see fig.7 to advise that in analog to digital converter indicated by numeral 54 the date Dp is ready so that the operation is to be cut off.From the circuit detail of fig.ll it is further possible to deduce that the signal of the bus of data D3 relating to microprocessor 56 as well as those of control bus C3 frm the pro grammable gate P and addressing bus BAof processor are all p conveyed to the integrated circuit IC22.The operational continuation of electronic system 50 according to block diagram of fig.7 is carried out substantially in a conventional manner to display the results as stated above.Original data are then stored in a write read memory RAM Ran dom access Memory indicated by numeral 58. In this embodiment the RAM is provided with two sets of 128 data, while three other free sets are utilized by the microprocessor 56 to process the data with the aid of an arithmetical processor 57 as soon as a first sët of data D is ready. pThe program of the data acquirement, processing, storage and display is performed in a memory EFROM Read only Memory indicated by numeral 59. It may be important to notice that such memory has been provided with an employment of 8Kx8, wherein K is the measuring unit equal to 1024, as it is well knows. Through the interfaces indicated by reference numerals 60, 62, 64 the desired presentation o alpha numerical and diagramatic results relating to the examination of one or more samples of seminal liquid is ths carried out. That is to say, the results relating to the examination of each sample,after the beating phenomenon is evidenced through the rejoined beam A7 of device 10 are sent to the processor of electronic system 50 and disp layed advantageously in a short time in order that an objective and reliable evaluation may be deduced therefrom in accordance with the basis principles of the present invention.
