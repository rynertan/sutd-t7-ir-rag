# Gate array large scale integrated circuit devices.

## Abstract
Gate array LSI s are produced with the aid of a standard layout pattern defining a basic cell array region 2 , on which internal cell arrays are arranged, and a peripheral circuit region 3 , arranged on the periphery of the basic cell array region. The peripheral circuit region comprises input output cell regions 7 , for constructing an input buffer circuit and a part of an output circuit, and a general purpose cell array region 4 which can be used for constructing remaining parts of the output buffer circuit. Where the general purpose cell array region is not used in the construction of such a buffer circuit it can be used for constructing various other desired circuits. Thus greater design flexibility is made available.
