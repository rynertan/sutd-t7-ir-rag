# OPTICAL FIBER ALIGNMENT AND RETENTION DEVICE

## Abstract
A fiber alignment and retention apparatus 10 having an optical lens 32 with a forwardly directed curved surface molded to a rearward extension 16 having a vee shaped groove 18 for supporting an optical fiber. An abutment means 40 comprises a vertical stop 44 for positioning the fiber at a focal point of the lens and also includes an abutment gap 50 containing an index matching adhesive 54 for reducing refraction and attenuation of a transmitted optical signal. A heat sensitive shrink sleeve 30 secures the fiber within the vee shaped groove such that a terminal end 46 of the fiber is aligned with the focal point of the lens. A clamp 86 or spring 94 finger may replace the shrink sleeve 30 . A first alternative embodiment includes a holding means having a cylindrical shaped rearward extension with longitu dinal cutaway sections providing a spring tension for securing the fiber. A second alternative embodiment in cludes a lens with a rearwardly directed radiused surface for guiding and retaining the fiber.
