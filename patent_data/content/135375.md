# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO THE ANALYSIS OF MATERIALS

## Abstract
This invention provides a method of analysing materials, comprising the steps of subjecting a surface of the material to high energy impact by a laser to cause ablation and vapourisation such as to generate a gaseous and or gas borne sample of the material, transporting all or part of the gaseous and or gas borne sample of the material to a remote analytical apparatus, and analysing the gaseous and or gas borne sample of the material at the remote analytical device so as to determine the constituent compartments of the material, together with Apparatus for carrying out this method.
