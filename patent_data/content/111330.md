# Guide vane operating mechanism for water turbines.

## Abstract
Provided is a guide vane operating mechanism in a hydraulic machine including a main shaft 19 carrying a runner 18 and guide vanes 1 for varying the angle of attack of water to the runner. The mechanism comprises a guide ring 31 rotatably arranged around the main shaft, a guide vane driving mechanism for linkage between the main shaft and the guide vanes so as to drive the guide vanes between full open and full close positions, at least one servomotor 13 having a reciprocative actuating rod 12, and a guide ring actuating mechanism for transmitting the driving power to the guide ring to cause a rotation of the latter. The guide ring actuating mechanism includes means for connecting the actuating rod 12 to the guide ring 31 in such a manner as to permit the actuating rod 12 and the guide ring 31 to make a cranking motion relative to each other.
