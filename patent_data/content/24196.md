# A method for the rotary forming of articles.

## Abstract
A method of continuously forming articles having a pre determined, varying cross sectional geometry which com prises continuously introducing molten thermoplastic mater ial from a die opening into a nip formed by opposing rotating rolls 16, 18 with at least one roll 16 having a cooled, arcuate mold cavity 19 in its surface contoured to correspond to each article cross sectional geometry thereby providing varying clearances in the nip, progressively successively arcuately forcing the mold cavity into shaping engagement with the molten thermoplastic material to mold the articles therefrom, maintaining the thermoplastic material containing the articles in contact with one of the rolls 16 after exiting the nip thereby forming a first, curved intermediate shape 78 wherein the thermoplastic material is partially set, immediately passing such shape over a cooled cylindrical surface 30 to further yet not completely set the thermoplastic material and transpose the first shape into a second shape reversely configured from the first shape, discharging the second, shape from the cylin drical surface in a substantially planar direction to straighten such shape and transpose the articles into a substantially flat condition while continuing to set the thermoplastic material, and thereafter separating the articles from the remainder of the thermoplastic material.
