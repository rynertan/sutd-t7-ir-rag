# IMPROVED PORTABLE TOILET

## Abstract
A portable toilet 10 has two vertically stacked sections, the lower section 12 being a holding tank, and the upper section 14 including a toilet bowl 22 , a water tank 26 for storage of water for flush purposes, and flush apparatus 32 for flushing the toilet bowl. Handles 78 and 80 are provided for separately carrying the lower section 12 and the upper section 14 , the handles being arranged so that they form a unitary handle for carrying the toilet 10 without the need of a clasping mechanism for holding the sections together. The flush apparatus 32 including the flush bulb 84 is so pro vided that priming of the flushing system is unnecessary. A valve assembly 46 is mounted within the confines of the lower section 12 by providing a planar member 58 that is a part of the valve body 56 and can be inserted through an opening 72 in the top wall of the lower section 12 for attachment to the top wall within the holding tank.
