# Apparatus for producing oxidized filaments.

## Abstract
Apparatus for continuously producing continuous oxi dized filaments 1 includes a series of tower guide rollers 4a, 4b, 4c . . . provided at the outside of a furnace 2 for guiding the filaments and a series of gas suction seal cham bers 8a, 8b, 8c . . . provided inside the bottom of the fur nace. The gas suction seal chambers have a series of sub partition plates 23a, 23b, 23c . . . which are arranged along the path of filaments and have gas passing means. The ex ternal air which tends to go into the furnace through the slits 10 formed in the bottom wall 20 of the furnace will be sucked into the gas suction seal chambers and prevented from entering the heated oxidizing atmosphere in the fur nace. Thus the temperature variation in the furnace will be reduced and the quality of produced filaments will be im proved. The upper guide rollers 3a, 3b, 3c . . . may be out side or inside the furnace 2 . If they are outside the furnace 2 , a series of gas supply seal chambers 5a, 5b, 5c . . . in side the top of the furnace 2 performs an analogous func tion to the gas suction seal chambers 8a, 8b, 8c . . . at the bottom.
