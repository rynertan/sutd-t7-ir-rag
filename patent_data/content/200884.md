## Description
The present invention relates to passive radio frequency circuitry and, more particularly, to a novel radio frequency RF four way power splitter combiner apparatus operating in a push pull mode. In many high power RF applications, such as magnetic resonance imaging and the like, vacuum tube amplifiers are utilized to provide the relatively high RF excitation energy needed. However, solid state devices capable of generating RF power outputs of the required magnitude are available at lower RF frequencies, and are expected to be shortly available at RF frequencies in the lower VHF region use of solid state power amplifiers is highly desirable, to provide the desired excitation signal with larger bandwidth over a longer lifetime higher reliability require simpler cooling systems and cost less. At present, providing even a high frequency RF power amplifier with significant, e.g. greater than several hundred watts, power output requires that the output of several individual power amplifier modules, each capable of providing only a portion of the required output power, be combined. The input power for the plurality of amplifier modules must itself be provided by splitting a common input signal. Accordingly, it is highly desirable to provide apparatus having a common terminal and four other terminals, a first pair of which is at a 180 phase difference from a second pair of other terminals, and with the four way apparatus being utilizable for either a power splitting function, i.e. wherein the common port receives input power and the four ports each provide approximately one fourth of the input power as driving power to an associated input of a different power amplifier, or as a power combiner, i.e. wherein the output power received at each of the four other ports is combined into a signal at the common output port. It is well known to the prior art to provide four way splitter combiner apparatus utilizing broadband transformers in which coaxial lines of several different characteristic impedances, e.g. 25 and 50 ohm lines, are utilized with 4 1 impedance transformers, to provide four other port signals all having the same phase angle, responsive to a single signal at the common port. Typical prior art configurations can be found in Application Note AN 749, entitled Broadband Transformers and Power Combining Techniques for RF , in the In accordance with the invention, a four way power splitter combiner apparatus comprises five coaxial unbalanced ports, configured as a common port and four other ports, with power introduced into the common port, over a relatively wide frequency band, being substantially equally divided between the four other ports, with each of first and second pairs of ports having 180 phase difference between the pairs and with a first one of each pair of the other ports having a 0 signal phase difference from the remaining one of that port pair. In presently preferred embodiments, coaxial cables of only the normal system impedance, e.g. 50 ohms, are utilized three or five ferrite loaded transformation sections are used to provide each push pull four way power splitter combiner apparatus. Accordingly, it is one object of the present invention to provide a novel five port four way power splitter combiner apparatus having each of two pairs of other ports separated by substantially 180 phase difference and operating in the push pull mode. This and other objects of the present invention will become apparent upon reading of the following detailed description of the invention, when considered in conjunction with the drawings. Referring initially to Figure 1, an illustrative high power RF amplifier 10 contains a plurality of amplifier modules 11 and a plurality of power splitting combining means 12, for amplifying the power output of an RF source 14, and providing the amplified power signal to a load 16. In the particular illustrated configuration, four power modules 11 1 through 11 4 are utilized, along with a pair of power splitting combining means 12 1 and 12 2. Each of amplifier modules 11 1 through 11 4 has an associated RF signal input 11 1a through 11 4a and an associated RF signal output 11 1b through 11 4b. Each of signal inputs 11 1a through 11 4a is connected to one of a like number of a plurality of splitting combining means ports 12 1a through 12 1d, respectively, of first means 12 1, herein operating as a power splitting means. Similarly, each respective power amplifier module output 11 1b through 11 4b is individually connected to an associated one of the respective four ports 12 2a through 12 2d of the second power means 12 2, herein operating as a power combining means. The four ports 12 1a through 12 1d of power splitting means 12 1 can be considered as outputs A D or OUT A through OUT D , while the four ports 12 2a through 12 2d of power combining means 12 2 can be considered as inputs A D or IN A through IN D . Each of means 12 has a common RF port, e.g. common part 12 1e of the power splitting means and common port 12 2e of the power combining means. For purposes of description, each of ports 12 1a through 12 1d or 12 2a through 12 2d will be hereinafter referred to as a 4 port, and ports 12 1e and 12 2e will be referred to as a common port. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the 4 ports are paired, with each pair of 4 ports, e.g. the pair of 4 ports port A and B or the pair of 4 ports C and D, having identical phase, e.g. a phase of about 0 , or about 180 , respectively, with respect to a signal at the common port each pair of 4 ports thus has a phase difference of about 180 with respect to the other pair of 4 ports. Each 4 port provides a splitting combining ratio of about 0 dB. with respect to the other 4 port of that pair each pair has about a 0 dB. ratio with respect to the other pair. Thus, one pair of 4 ports, e.g. ports A and B, forms a push pull configuration with the other pair of 4 ports, e.g. ports C and D. This provides the additional beneficial features normally obtained from push pull amplifier operation, such as suppression of even harmonics of the operating RF frequency, and the like. Referring now to Figures 2a and 2b, a first presently preferred embodiment of a four way power splitting combining means 12, having two pair of 4 ports, with each pair in phase opposition to the other pair, is illustrated. Four way apparatus 12 comprises first and second three port hybrid circuits 18 1 and 18 2 each comprised of a pair of transmission line transformers 20 1a and 20 1b, or 20 2a and 20 2b, respectively, and an isolation resistance element 22 1 or 22 2, respectively. Coaxial balanced to unbalanced, or balun, transformer 24 is connected between the pair of transmission line transformers 18 and the apparatus common port 12 1e. Each of the apparatus 4 ports 12 1A through 12 1D and the common port 12 1E are designed for optimum operation with the same load resistance R Each of transmission line transformers 20 1a, 20 1b, 20 2a and 20 2b is constructed of a length of a coaxial cable 28, having an impedance Z The balun transformer 24 is fabricated of a length of coaxial cable 34 having a characteristic impedance Z Referring now to Figure 2c, the common port impedance vs. frequency response, of one splitter combiner apparatus of this embodiment type, is illustrated. The magnitude of the 50 ohm nominal common impedance is plotted along ordinate 41, for values between 40 ohms and 60 ohms, while the 0 nominal phase, is plotted along auxiliary ordinate 42, for values between 10 and 10 , with respect to frequencies between about 2 MHz. and about 110 MHz. plotted along abscissa 43. Solid curve 45 is the impedance magnitude curve, read in conjunction with ordinate 41, while broken line curve 46 is the common port phase curve, read with respect to auxiliary ordinate 42. Both curves are plotted for the condition wherein each of the four ports is terminated with a low reflectivity load of characteristic impedance, e.g. about 50 jO ohms. It will be seen that a common port VSWR of less than 1.1 1 and a total phase change of less than 6 occurs over the entire range between about 2 MHz. and about 110 MHz. Referring now to Figure 2d, a 4 port voltage V Referring now to Figures 3a and 3b, the five cable embodiments 12 and 12 can be replaced by another presently preferred embodiment 12 , which requires only three coaxial cable assemblies. Splitter combiner apparatus 12 utilizes a first coaxial transformer means 60 1 for combining the in phase power provided at first and second input 4 ports 12 1A and 12 1B each providing, and operating with, a terminating impedance R I prefer to realize the pair of 2 to 1 impedance transformer means 60 1 and 60 2 with each transformer means having a single coaxial cable 63 1 or 63 2. In the first transformation means 60 1, the first end 74a of a center conductor is connected to 4 port 12 1A and one end of resistance 65 1, while the other center conductor end 74b is connected to the transformation means output 66 1. The center conductor is surrounded by insulative dielectric material 75 and has an outer conductive sheath having a first end 76a, adjacent to first center conductor end 74a, which is connected to second center conductor end 74b and the output 66 1. The opposite outer conductor end 76b, adjacent to second center conductor end 74b, is connected to second 4 port 12 1B and the remaining end of resistance 65 1. In the second transformation means 60 2, the first end 74c of the center conductor is connected to output 66 2. The center conductor second end 74d is connected to second 4 port 12 1D and the one end of resistance 65 2. The center conductor is surrounded by insulative dielectric material 75 and has an outer conductive sheath having a first end 76c, adjacent to first center conductor end 74c, which is connected to the remaining 4 port 12 1c and the remaining end of resistance 65 2. The second outer conductor end 76d, adjacent to second center conductor end 74d, is connected to first center conductor end 74c and the second transformer output 66 2. Balun transformer means 67 utilizes a single coaxial cable 69, having a first center conductor end 77a connected to the output 66 1 of the first impedance transformer means 60 1 and having the center conductor second end 77b connected to common output connection means 12 1E. The center conductor is supported by insulative dielectric material 78 within a tubular outer conductor having a first end 79a connected to the second transformation means output 66 2 and a second end 79b connected to RF common potential adjacent to common port connection means 12 1E. A plurality of ferrite decoupling elements 71 encloses the coaxial cable 69. Referring now to Figure 3c, the common port impedance vs. frequency response of one splitter combiner apparatus of this embodiment type is illustrated. The magnitude of the 50 ohm nominal common impedance is plotted along ordinate 80, for values between 40 ohms and 60 ohms, while the 0 nominal phase is plotted along auxiliary ordinate 81, for values between 10 and 10 , with respect to frequencies between about 2 MHz. and about 90 MHz. plotted along abscissa 82. Upper curve 84 is the impedance magnitude curve, read in conjunction with ordinate 80, while lower curve 86 is the common port phase curve, read with respect to auxiliary ordinate 81. Both curves are plotted for the condition wherein each of the four other ports is terminated with a low reflectivity load of characteristic impedance, e.g. about 50 jO ohms. It will be seen that a common port VSWR of less than about 1.1 1 and a total phase change of less than about 10 occurs over the multi octave frequency range between about 5 MHz. and about 80 MHz., with a somewhat greater total phase change occurring over the entire range between about 2 MHz. and about 90 MHz. Referring now to Figure 3d, a 4 port voltage V Accordingly, a wide band 4 port splitter combiner apparatus can be provided with a single balanced transformer and a pair of 2 port combining transformation means, to realize a relatively simple and physically compact 4 way power splitting combining apparatus having first and second pairs of ports, with the two ports in each pair being substantially in phase with one another and with each port pair being substantially 180 out of phase with the opposite port pair, i.e. operating in a push pull mode. While several presently preferred embodiments of my novel push pull 4 port power splitting combining apparatus are described in detail herein, many variations and modifications will now become apparent to those skilled in the art. It is my intent, therefore, to be limited only by the scope of the impending claims and not by way of the specific details and instrumentalities provided herein as illustrative of presently preferred embodiments.
