# Lifting apparatus.

## Abstract
Lifting apparatus in combination with at least one substantially upright wall having an opening therein for providing access through the wall. The preferred combina tion comprises a vehicle, such as, a van 1 , having a rear or side door opening therein, the lifting apparatus including a generally planar, load support portion 12 which is movable between a storage position A,C interior of the vehicle 1 and an operative position B exterior of the vehicle. In the operative position B , the load support portion 12 lies in a generally horizontal plane substantially normal to that of the vehicle opening, with the support portion 12 being movable between its storage position A,C and its operative position B via an intermediate, inoperative position exterior of the vehicle 1 . In this inoperative position, the load support portion 12 lies in a generally vertical plane substantially normal to that of the opening to provide substantially unobstructed access through the opening to the vehicle interior. The lifting apparatus preferably comprises a parallelo gram type raising and lowering portion 9,9 operated by a piston cylinder arrangement 8,8 , the load support portion 12 being pivotally movable between its intermediate and operative positions with respect to the raising and lowering portion.
