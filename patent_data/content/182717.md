# A read only memory circuit.

## Abstract
A ROM circuit intended to substitute for the convention al fuse type ROMs to be incorporated in a semiconductor integrated circuit network together with other circuit blocks on a chip. The ROM circuit comprises a first transistor 1 having a control gate 11 and a floating gate 12 and a de pletion type second transistor 2 having a gate formed as an extension of the floating gate 12 . The second transistor 2 outputs a high level control signal it hot electrons have been accumulated on the floating gate 12 of the first transistor 1 by the application of a predetermined high level input signal to the control gate 11 , and outputs a low level signal when the high level input signal has not been provided to the con trol gate 11 . The first transistor 1 is freed from so called soft write because it is separated from a voltage source in the read mode.
