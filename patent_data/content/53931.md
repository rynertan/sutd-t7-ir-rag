# Use of adhesive compositions in flooring systems.

## Abstract
An adhesive composition comprises a mixture of at least 50 parts dry weight of a water based polymer in latex form having a film forming temperature below 25 C, and at least 0.5 parts dry weight of a thickening agent. The adhesive may be applied as a layer to a carpet backing, dried and subsequently activated with water to adhere the carpet to a floor. After drying, the adhesive layer may be reactivated with water to permit the carpet to be removed from the floor. The adhesive layer, when dried on the surface of a latex foam backed carpet, provides a non tacky surface which increases the abrasion resistance of the latex foam backing, thereby reducing damage to the backing during normal storage and handling.
