## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING BUTYL RUBBER This invention relates to a novel process for the dehydrohalogenation of halogenated butyl rubber for the preparation of conjuaated diene butyl rubber having randomly distributed sites of unsaturation in which at least one double bond of the pair of double bonds comprising the diolefin unsaturation is located in the chain of carbon atoms comprising the polymer backbone, or is in a ring of carbon atoms which is integral with said backbone. The expression Butyl Rubber is used in the rubber industry as a generic term to describe elastomeric polymers prepared from a polymerization reaction mixture having therein from about 70 to 99.5 weight percent of one or more C4 to C7 isoolefins, e.q., isobutene, 2 methylbutene l, and about 30 to 0.5 weight percent of one or more C4 to C14 acyclic or alicyclic conjugated multiolefins, e.q., isoprene, cyclopentadiene. The resulting copolymers or terpolymers contain about 85 to 99.5 percent by weight of combined isoolefin and about 0.5 to 15 percent by weight of combined multiolefin. The Dreparation of butyl rubber is described in U.S. Patent No. 2,356,128 which is incorporated herein by reference. Commercially available butyl rubber is essentially a linear copolymer made up primarily of isobutene units with a few percent of randomly distributed isoprene units. When polymerized by means of aFriedel Crafts catalyst the isoolefin and multiolefin combine, with the isoprene contributing the small amount of mono olefinic unsaturation present in butyl rubber. The basic preparative equation is represented by EMI1.1 where n 1 represents the number of isoolefin units incorporated in the butyl rubber, and m represents the number of diolefin units initially present in the copolymer, substantially as randomly distributed isolated units. When incorporated in the copolymer, for example by 1 4 addition, the isonrene loses one olefinic linkage with a shift in position of the remaining one.In early texts dealing with the chemistry of conjugated diolefins, the shift in position of the remaining olefinic linkage was termed exaltation of the double bond, a phrase coined by Thiele in Germany. Halogenated butyl rubber has been developed in recent years and has contributed significantly to the field of elastomers. One method for preparing halogenated butyl rubber is described in U.S. PatentNo. 3,099,644, which is incorporated herein by reference. Both chlorinated and brominated butyl rubber are well known in the elastomer art. Formulae for halogenated butyl rubber may be typified by EMI2.1 where n 1 and M have the same values as for butyl rubber, noted above, and X is chlorine or bromine. When butyl rubber is halogenated, substitution occurs not only at secondary and tertiary carbon atoms but also to a very limited degree at primary sites.Under the conditions of dehydrohalogenation disclosed in the instant invention, primary halogens are relatively unreactive, resulting in a residual halogen content in the conjugated diene butyl, formed by dehydrohalogenation, in the range of about 0.04 to about 0.1 weight percent. Among the structures formed on dehydrohalogenation are EMI3.1 where n 1 and m are as noted above. While the formulae shown in 7 and 8 are representative of the structures formed when a commercial grade of halogenated butyl rubber such as Exxon Chlorobutyl HT 1068its dehydrochlorinated, other structures may be formed, in particular when a diolefin other than isoprene is employed in the butyl synthesis. Suitable diolefins comprise piperylene, dimethyl butadiene, cyclopentadiene and 1,3 cyclohexadiene. U.S. Patent 2,577,822 which is incorporated herein by reference details the preParation of a copolymer of isobutylene and cyclopentadiene and U.S. Patent 3,080,337 which is incorporated herein by reference details the preparation of terpolymers of isobutylene, a cyclodiene and isoprene. Possible structures of the diolefin mofety in conjugated diene butyl are shown in U.S. Patent 3,965,213 which is incorporated herein by reference. Thus the products prepared by the process of this invention include polymeric compositions of matter comprisina from about 85 to 99.5 percent by weight of one or more C4 to C7 isoolefins and from about 15 to 0.5 percent by weight of one or more C4 to C14 randomly distributed conjugated diolefin moieties in which part or all of said moieties have at least one double bond located in the polymer backbone chain of carbon atoms, or is in a rina of carbon atoms forming an integral part of said chain. Various methods and reagents have been employed in the prior art to dehydrohalogenate halogenated butyl rubber for the purpose of preparing a butyl rubber containing conjugated diolefin moieties. U.S. Patent 3,775,387 discloses a semi homoeneous process for preparing conjugated diene butyl rubber, hereinafter referred to asCDB, in which a solution of the haloqenated butyl rubber is contacted with a reaction mixture comprisinq 1 a soluble metal carboxylate, where the metal is selected from Groups Ib, IIb, IVa and VIII of thePeriodic Table of the Elements 2 a soluble carboxylic acid and 3 an oxide or hydroxide of a metal selected from Groups Ia or IIa of the Periodic Table.

U.S. Patent 3,852,253 discloses a heterogeneous process for preparing CDB from halogenated butyl rubber by contacting a solution of the halobutyl with a strong mineral acid salt of a metal selected from the metals in Groups IIa and Ilb of the Periodic Table. U.S. Patent 3,965,213 which is a continuation in part of U.S.Patent 3,816,371 claims compositions and cured compositions thereof of an isoolefin and a conjugated diolefin selected from the group consisting of isoprene, piperylene, dimethylbutadiene, cyclopentadiene, methylcyclopentadiene or mixtures thereof. U.S. Patent 3,968,185 claims compositions and methods for crosslinking conjugated diene butyl rubber catalyzed by free radical initiators. U.S. Patent 4,038,472 claims methods for curing conjugated diene butyl rubber utilizing hydroquinone and an oxidizing reaqent. U.S. Patent 4,068,051 details a process for the preparation of CDB from haloqenated butyl by the method of U.S. Patent 3,775,387 with the improverent of a hydrophyllic agent or purging with a drying gas. U.S. Patents 4,145,492 and 4,211,855 claim a process for the preparation of COB from halogenated butyl by catalytic dehydrohalogenation with sported copper oxide or chloride. All of the above cited patents are incorporated herein by reference.A preferred embodiment of the invention defined in the claims providesa process for the preparation of a multi olefinic elastomeric polymer having randomly distributed conjunated diolefinic unsaturation comprises copolymerizing one or more C4 to C7 acyclic alpha isoolefins with one or more C4 to C14 acyclic or alicyclic conjugated diolefins with the aid of a Friedel Crafts catalyst to form a polymer having randomly distributed monoolefinic double bonds, in which part or all of said double bonds are located in the chain of carbon atoms comprising the polymer backbone or are in an alicyclic rinq of carbon atoms which is an integral part of said polymer backbone substitutively halogenating said polymer in a non reactive solvent to form a halide which is allylic tasaid monoolefinic double bonds reacting a solution of the allylically halogenated polymer in a non reactive solvent in a reaction zone with a reagent comprising the reaction product of zinc oxide or hydroxide and a C5 to C18 acyclic or alicyclic carboxylic acid, prepared in situ in said non reactive solvent, while continuously removing water from said reaction zone by physical entrainment and recovering a polymer, freed from inorganic and acidic constituents, which possesses random conjugated diolefin moieties in which at least one double bond of the pair of double bonds comprising the conjugated diolefin unsaturation is located in the chain of carbon atoms comprising the polymer backbone or is in an alicyclic ring forming an integral part of said backbone. Figure 1 is an illustration of the laboratory reactor system used to carry out the process of the invention.DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 1. REAGENTS A.

D. Halogenated Butyl Rubber Chlorinated or brominated butyl rubber, or mixtures thereof, are suitable for the practice of this invention. Chlorobutyl HT 1068 manufactured by Exxon Chemical Co. having a chlorine content of 1.16 weight percent was used in the following examples. E. Experimental Equipment A one liter glass reactor illustrated in Figure 1 was used in the followina examoles. The reactor 1 is fitted with a vapor jacket 2, thermometer 3, and motor driven stirrer 4, of which the stirrer shaft 6, has a capillary lumen 7, through which nitrogen or other inert gas may be fed to the reaction mixture through tubulature 5, and shaft opening 8. A precision ground and lapped fit between shaft 6 and bushing 9 prevents loss of reaction solvent. Vapor jacket 2 is fitted with a reflux condenser 10 and reactor 1 is fitted with a water trap 11 and reflux condenser 12.The temperature of the reaction mixture in the reactor is maintained at a constant level by refluxing the heating medium 13, having a narrow boiling point ranqe, contained in flask 14. The conjugated diene butyl rubber of this invention may be cured by a variety of methods, e.g., sulfur, sulfur containing curing agents, the latter polyfunctional dienophiles and the like, and forms also used in combination with accelerators. Monofunctional dienophiles are suitable for further modification of the rubber. Examples of polyfunctional dienophiles include m phenylene bis maleimide, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, and trimethylol propane trimethacrylate examples of monofunctional dienophiles include cis 2 butene diol, maleic anhydride, croton aldehyde and the like. Conjugated diene rubber containing compositions typically include fillers and reinforcing materials such as carbon black, fiberglass, and or mineral fillers, extenders such as rubber processing oils, process aids, antioxidants and or antiozonants, etc. Said compositions may also be covulcanized with other rubbers including butyl, halogenated butyl, EPDM, general purpose rubbers such as natural rubber, SBR and the like. Products manufactured from conjugated diene rubbercontaining compositions are useful in a wide variety of applications including tire, automotive, electrical, mechanical, etc.EXAMPLE 1 In order to demonstrate that the zinc must be present in the reaction mixture in a hydrocarbon soluble form, a control run was made as follows 732 g. of chlorobutyl HT 1068 containing 2 parts per hundred of rubber phr by weight of zinc oxide dissolved in 350 ml of commer cial olefin free heptane comprised of 50 vol. paraffins, 48 vol. naphthenes and 2.0 vol. aromatics and 650 ml of Isopar G a proprietary solvent of Exxon Chemical Co. comprised of highly branched, 0 olefin free paraffins boiling in the range of about 155 175 C was charged to the reactor. The air in the reactor was displaced with nitrogen and the reaction mixture heated with stirring at 1080C for 150 minutes, using refluxing toluene in the jacket. A sample of the polymer recovered from the reaction mixture by centrifugation to separate the zinc oxide, followed by washing the supernatant cement rubber containing solution with acidified aqueous isoprooyl alcohol and addition of the washed solution to a large volume of acetone, gave, on an analysis of the dried Droduct, 1.2 wt. of chlorine and absence of conjugated diene when examined by U.V. spectroscopy at 237 nm.EXAMPLE 2 Example 1 was repeated with the addition of 0.55 9 of 2 ethylhexanoic acid. After heating for 150 minutes at a temnerature of 1080C using refluxing toluene in the jacket of the reactor, a sample of the polymer recovered from the reaction mixture as In Example 1 gave on analysis 0.21 wt. of chlorine and 1.42 mole percent conjugated diolefin by U.V. spectroscopy.EXAMPLE 3 308.1 g. of a cement prepared from 35 g. of Chlorobutyl andIsopar G were charged to the reactor. The reactor jacket was charged with methylcellosolve. While stirrinq ra pidly, 1.4 g. of zinc oxide powder was dispersed in the cement. The reactor was then heated and 0.7 g. of zinc 2 ethyihexanoate added. After 80 minutes of heating at 124 1250C under nitrogen polymer was collected and analyzed as inExample 1 had 0.02 wt. percent chlorine and 1.46 mole percent conjugated diene.EXAMPLE 4 Another experiment was run as described in Example 3 but with replacement of the zinc 2 ethylhexanoate by 0.7 g. stearic acid. After 80 minutes of heating at 124 1250C under nitrogen, polymer collected as in Example 1 analyzed as containing 0.04 wt. percent chlorine and 1.37 mole percent conjugated diene.EXAMPLE 5 Two and one half parts of zinc oxide was milled into 100 parts of chlorobutyl HT 1068 and the resulting mixture dissolved in xylene to form a 10 percent by weight cement which was charged to the reactor.2 parts by weight of 2 ethyl hexanoic acid was added with stirring and after purging with nitroqen the mixture was heated to 1360C using refluxina xylene as the heatinq medium After only 4 minutes of heating the mixture the chlorine content of a sample of the treated polymer was reduced from 1.16 weight percent to 0.11 weiqht percent.EXAMPLE 6 Example 5 was repeated except that the solvent xylene was replaced with Isopar G. The mixture was heated with stirring for 40 minutes 0 at 135 C after which the dehydrochlorinated polymer was recovered as in Example 1. Analysis gave a chlorine content of 0.8 wt. percent.A determination of the solution viscosity ratio of the recovered product at a concentration of 0.5 mg ml in dimer a mixture 2,2,4 trimethyl pentene l and 2,2,4 trimethylpentene 2 gave a result of 0.803 0.745 compared to the feed chlorobutyl HT 1068 of 0.805 0.747. Following recovery and drying, twenty five Darts of the dehydrc halogenated product was compounded on a rubber mill with 12.5 parts of SRF Black, 0.25 parts stearic acid, 0.25 parts of AceRite White an antioxidant consisting of dibetanaphthyl p phenylene diamine and 0.50 parts of SR 350 a vulcanizing agent consisting of trimethylol 0 propane trimethacrylate and pads of the compound were cured at 340 F for 30 minutes, 60 minutes and 120 minutes. The pads were tested in toluene for solubility and swell ratio. The results obtained were as follows Cure Time Swell Ratio Insoluble 30 min. 4.47 91.0 60 min. 3.47 94.3 120 min. 3.07 93.8 This Example shows that aliphatic solvents may be employed for the dehydrohalogenation of a halobutyl rubber when a reagent comprising zinc oxide and a hydrocarbon soluble acid are reacted in situ with a halobutyl.EXAMPLE 7 While water is the normal by product of the reaction of zinc oxide or hydroxide with the acids useful for the practice of this invention, the presence of water in the reaction mixture can severely inhibit or prevent reaction from occurinq between the halobutyl and the reaction product of the zinc and acid reaqents. Where the zinc component, e.g., zinc oxide, is admixed with the halobutyl on a mill prior to solvation to form a cement, or the zinc component is dispersed in a previously formed cement, the cement may be rendered free of moisture by purging with dry nitrogen or other inert gas, or the cement may be heated to form solvent water azeotrope 0 boiling below 100 C which is then taken overhead for collection in a trap. Where the solvent is relatively high boiling, such as the Isopar G used in Examole 6, a small quantity of a low boiling material, such as benzene, may be added to the cement to take overhead an azeotrope boiling at 69.40C containing 8.9 of water.Examples of other water entraining hydrocarbons are hexane, which forms an azeotrope at 0 61.6 C containing 5.6 of water, and heptane, which forms an azeotrope boiling at 79.20C containing 12.9 of water. The following run illustrates the negative effect of water in the system. A xylene cement was prepared to contain zinc oxide and chlorobytyl 1068 at a concentration of about 60 9. in 700 ml of cement. To 350 ml. of the cement were added 2 ml. of water and 0.3 q. of 2 ethyl hexanoic acid. The cement was heated for 80 minutes at 1070C using refluxing toluene in the jacket. Since xylene forms an azeotrope boiling at 94.50C containing 40 water, the trap was omitted, and the reflux condenser fitted directly to the reactor. Water collected in the free space of the reactor and condensed on the glass. A sample of polymer recovered from the reaction mixture and analyzed contained 0.81 wt. chlorine. The run was repeated with the remaining 350 ml. of cement with omission of the water and flushing of the cement for 0.5 hour with nitrogen prior to addition of the acid. After 80 minutes of heating at 106 107 C, during which nitrogen was fed to the reactor, a sample of polymer recovered from the reaction mixture gave, on analysis, 0.05 wt. of chlorine. It has been observed that when zinc oxide is reacted with a carboxylic acid, with the addition of a small amount of water to initiate the reaction, in situ in a hydrocarbon medium, that the zinc carboxylate formed under these conditions is best reported as having the formulaEMI10.1 rather thanEMI10.2 which is formed when a sodium or potassium carboxylate is reacted in aqueous solution with zinc chloride or zinc sulfate. The former product is more highly colored than the normal zinc salt and is of lower viscosity when both are prepared from 2 ethylhexanoic acid. Both zinc reagents perform satisfactorily in the instant process and use of the term zinc carboxylate is intended to refer to either or both.
