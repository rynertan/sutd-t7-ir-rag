## Description
Herbicides This invention concerns herbicidal compositions and a herbicidal method. In one aspect, the invention provides a herbicidal composition which comprises a benazolin, i.e. 4 chloro 2 oxobenzothiazolin 3 yl acetic acid, or a salt or ester thereof and b dimefuron, i.e. 2 t butyl 4 2 chloro 4 3,3 dimethylureido phenyl 1,3,4 oxadiazolin 5 one in association with a suitable carrier and or surface active agent. In another aspect, the invention provides a method of combating weeds which comprises applying to a locus infested or liable to be infested therewith, an effective amount of the two components a and b . Each of the components a and b is known separately as a herbicide. When used in combination, however, the combination is synergistic. Where the benazolin component is employed in the form of a salt, it is preferably an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt, e.g. a sodium, potassium or calcium salt. When it is employed in the form of an ester, it is preferably an alkyl ester, e.g. where the alkyl group is of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example the methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl or n butyl ester. The ethyl ester is particularly preferred. The weight ratio of a b is preferably from 1 1 to 1 4. The present compounds are normally employed in the form of compositions containing a surface active agent and or a carrier. The compositions will normally be produced initially containing from 0.5 to 99t, preferably from 0.5 to 85 , and more usually from 10 to 50 by weight of the present compounds, which are diluted if necessary before application to the locus to be treated such that the concentration of active ingredient in the formulation applied is from 0.05 to 5 by weight. The carrier may be water, in which case an organic solvent may also be present, though this is not usually employed. A flowable suspension concentrate may be formed by grinding the compound with water1 a wetting agent and a suspending agent, e.g. xanthan gum. The carrier may alternatively be a water immiscible organic solvent, e.g. a hydrocarbon which boils within the range 130 270 C, e.g. xylene, in which the compound is dissolved or suspended. An emulsifiable concentrate containing a water immiscible solvent may be formed with a surface active agent so that the concentrate acts as a self emulsifiable oil on admixture with water. The carrier may alternatively be a water miscible organic solvent e.g. 2 methoxy ethanol, methanol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, formamide or methylformamide. The carrier may alternatively be a solid, which may be finely divided or granular. Examples of suitable solids are limestone, clays, sand, mica, chalk, attapulgite, diatomite, perlite, sepiolite, silicas, silicates, lignosulphonates and solid fertilizers. The carrier can be of natural or synthetic origin or can be modified natural material. Wettable powders soluble or dispersible in water may be formed by admixing the compound in particulate form with a particulate carrier or spraying molten compound on to the particulate carrier, admixing a wetting agent and a dispersing agent and finely grinding the whole powder mixture. An aerosol composition may be formed by admixing the compound with a propellant, e.g. a polyhalogenated alkane such as dichlorofluoromethane, and suitably also with a solvent. The term surface active agent is used in the broad sense to include materials variously called emulsifying agents, dispersing agents and wetting agents. Such agents are well known in the art. The surface active agents used may comprise anionic surface active agents, for example mono or di esters of phosphoric acid with a fatty alcohol ethoxylate, or salts of such esters, fatty alcohol sulphates such as sodium dodecyl sulphate, ethoxylated fatty alcohol sulphates, ethoxylated alkylphenol sulphates, lignin sulphates, petroleum sulphonates, alkylaryl sulphonates such as alkyl benzene sulphonates or lower alkylnaphthalene sulphonates, salts of sulphonated naphthaleneformaldehyde condensates, salts of sulphonated phenolformaldekyde condensates, or more complex sulphonates such as the amide sulphonates, e.g. the sulphonated condensation product of oleic acid and N methyl taurine or the dialkyl sulphosuccinates e.g. the sodium sulphonate of dioctyl succinate. The surface active agents may also comprise non ionic agents, for example condensation products or fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, fatty acid amides or alkyl substituted phenols with ethylene oxide, fatty esters of polyhydric alcohol ethers e.g. sorbitan fatty acid esters, condensation products of such esters with ethylene oxide e.g. polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, acetylenic glycols such as 2,4,7,9 tetramethyl 5 decyn 4,7 diol, or ethoxylated acetylenic glycols. The surface active agents may also comprise cationic agents, for example alkyl and or aryl substituted quaternary ammonium compounds such as cetyl trimethylammonium bromide, or ethoxylated tertiary fatty amines. Preferred surface active agents include ethoxylated fatty alcohol sulphates, lignin sulphonates, alkyl aryl sulphonates, salts of sulphonated naphthaleneformaldehyde condensates, salts of sulphonated phenolformaldehyde condensates, sodium oleoyl N methyltauride, dialkyl sulphossucinates, alkyl phenol ethoxylates, and fatty alkyl ethoxylates. If the components a and b are applied sequentially, they may each be applied in a composition analogous to those described above. If desired, the compositions may contain one or more further pesticides, e.g. herbicides, fungicides or insecticides in addition to components a and b .Preferred further herbicides include clopyralid, propyzamide, carbetamide and ethyl 2 4 6 chloro 2 quinoxalinyloxy phenoxyjpropionate, especially clopyralid. The present method and compositions are highly effective for the selective control of weeds in crops. Amongst the weeds which are combated are broad leaf weeds including speedwells Veronica sPP. , chickweed Stellaria media , mayweeds Matricaria, Anthemis andChamomilla sup. . cleavers Galium aparine , forget me not Myosotis arvensis , parsley piert Aphanes arvensis , poppy Papaver rhoeas , corn spurrey Spergula arvensis , fumitory Fumaria officinalis , annual nettle Urtica urens , shepherd s purse Capsella bursaris , deadnettles Lamium spp , charlock Sinapis arvensis and field pansy Viola arvensis . The crops in which the present method and compositions may be employed include brassicas, e.g. swedes, turnips and cabbages, and especially oilseed rape. In the present method the amount of a applied is preferably from 0.15 to 1.0 kg ha, desirably 0.2 to 0.8 kg ha. The amount of b applied is preferably 0.1 to 2.0 kg ha, desirably 0.2 to 1.5 kg ha, especially 0.25 to 0.75 kg ha. If clopyralid is also employed, it is preferably applied at a rate of from 0.01 to 0.1, especially 0.02 to 0.07 kg ha. The method and compositions of the present invention are preferably employed post emergence of the crop species. EXAMPLESeeds of the plant species listed below were sown in 750 mm diameter plastic pots containing sterilised sandy loam. The pots were the watered and placed in a glasshouse until the plants had 4 or 5 true leaves. The plants then received a foliar spray of the compounds set out below, formulated as a solution in 1 1 by volume of acetone and the wetting agent polyoxyethylene 20 mols monolaurate solution 2 g per litre . The concentration of the test compounds and volume of application were calculated to give the desired rate of application of the compounds in 200 litres per hectare.After a further 24 days, the plants were visually assessed for percentage herbicidal response relative to an untreated control.
