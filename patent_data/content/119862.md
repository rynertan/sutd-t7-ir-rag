# Solid state color imaging apparatus.

## Abstract
An array of picture elements in rows ℓ₁, ℓ₂, etc provides inputs to vertical charge coupled device CCD registers which feed into a horizontal CCD register which provides the video output. In even fields transfers are made from even rows ℓ₂, ℓ₄, etc and then, after a one element shift from odd rows ℓ₁, ℓ₃, etc so that combined signals ℓ₂, ℓ₃ ℓ₄, etc are formed. Similarly in even fields the combined signals are ℓ₂ ℓ₃, ℓ₄ ℓ₅, etc. The elements have colour filters establishing a 2 element horizontal by 4 element vertical repeat pattern wherein a green component comes from all elements whereas red and blue components are modulated at a 2 element hori zontal rate with a line to line phase alternation applying to these components, but not the other. In accordance with the invention the said pattern is established using trans parent W , green G , yellow Ye and cyan Cy filters, where transparent passes all components, yellow passes red and green and cyan passes blue and green. Every row has at least one filter passing red and at least one passing blue within each 2 by 4 pattern block but the modulation of red and blue is retained as red components pass only alternate filters in odd lines with phase alternation whereas blue components pass only alternate filters in even lines without phase alternation .
