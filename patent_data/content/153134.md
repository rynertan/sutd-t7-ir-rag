## Description
This invention relates to the microbiological production of essential fatty acids. During a current screening programme thirty five strains of yeasts and fungi have been examined for γ linolenic acid production. Data in Tables 1 and 2 show that neither yeasts nor higher fungi produce γ linolenic acid. The C18 3 fatty acid produced by these fungi is α linolenic acid and, with the exception of Two isolates In subsequent fermentation runs in a 3 litre batch fermenter, with a higher stirring speed, Comparative studies growing Overall, Under these closely controlled conditions optimum yields of γ linolenic acid are obtained. Suitable carbohydrate energy sources include glucose, preferably in the form of such inexpensive materials as hydrolysed starch, e.g. maize starch. In the following medium, for example a yield of approximately 15 g dry weight litre fermentation medium is obtainable with a lipid yield of circa. 45 dry weight and a γ linolenic acid content on total lipids of 15 to 20 , i.e. 1.0 to 1.35 g litre fermentation medium. The medium is maintained with a carbon nitrogen ratio such that growth is nitrogen limited, for optimum γ linolenic acid yield. Based on the diffuse mycelial inoculum that we have found necessary for good growth throughout the medium the overall production of γ linolenic acid on a commercial basis by Rhizopus arrhizuz IMI 57412 is shown schematically in Figure 1. The fermentation medium as given earlier comprises a simple mineral salts sugar solution which is prepared and sterilised in the medium cooker 1. The actual glucose source is brewing grade hydrolysed maize starch 99 glucose . After sterilisation the fermentation medium is then cooled to 25 to 30 C by means of a cooling coil and jacket and the recovered hot water stored in a lagged holding tank 2. The bulk of the cooled fermentation medium is transferred to a previously steam sterilised main production fermenter 3 whilst a residual volume of medium 2,200 litres is retained for filling the seed vessel fermenters 4 The lay out of the plant, shown in Figure 2, takes advantage of gravity transfer wherever possible and makes optimal use of available space. A suitable lay out is four production fermenter vessels and ancillary equipment. The medium cooker 1 is mounted centrally in an elevated position between the four fermenter vessels two of which 3 The cooker 1 can be designed as a central facility to provide sterile fermentation media not only for a number of production fermenters 3 but also for the seed fermenters on a daily basis. It consists of a jacketed, top drive stirred motor 9 tank of 220 hl capacity which can be cleaned in place and steam sterilised. To avoid problems of precipitation and caramelisation arising from the incompatability of phosphates and sugars during media sterilisation the preparation and sterilisation of the inorganic media components is carried out separately in an auxiliary cooker capacity 10 hl and mixed aseptically with the remainder of the medium after cooling to a suitable temperature. Each main production fermenter vessel is constructed as a jacketed vessel the inner skin of which is fabricated from food grade stainless steel. It is stirred by a bottom drive motor assembly 10 operating stirrers 13 through a reduction gearbox. Cleaning of the internal surfaces is by a permanently installed clean in place system tank 8 and steam sterilisation of the vessel. Temperature control of the fermentation process 25 C is achieved by continuous sensing of the culture medium which in turn controls the flow of chlorinated water circulating through the fermenter jacket 11 and internal cooling coils not seen . The pH of the medium is continuously monitored throughout the growth cycle and maintained by automatic addition of alkali when required. Foam suppression is achieved by a mechanical foam breaker 12 in conjunction with, if necessary, timed anti foam i.e. chemical foam breaker additions. The anti foam used should be chosen to avoid clumping of the mycelium rather than the desired diffuse filamentous growth and silicone anti foams with non ionic emulsifiers are suitable, for example that sold by Midland Silicones U.K. as research grade anti foam. Upon completion of the growth cycle the spent medium plus the mycelium is discharged at 14 into a refrigerated holding tank as 5, Fig. 1, not seen to enable the fermenter to be re cleaned, re sterilised, refilled and re inoculated. Following the discharge of the spent medium and mycelium into the holding tank 5 the separation of the cells is achieved using standard continuous centrifugation methods. The ejected solids are stored until required for oil extraction whilst the spent medium is discharged.
