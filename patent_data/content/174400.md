# Improved data entry switch.

## Abstract
A new and improved switch incorporating an integral contact and return spring element O for use in data entry keyboards is disclosed. The unitary contact and return spring element includes a spring member 10 and a contact member 12 . At rest, only the spring member contacts the underlying circuit board 8 at a first terminal T 1 . If the spring contact is compressed a suitable distance, however, the contact member contacts a second portion T 2 of the circuit board to complete a circuit between the first and second terminal.
