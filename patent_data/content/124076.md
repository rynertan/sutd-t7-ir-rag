## Description
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel recombinant plasmids obtained by genetic engineering techniques and their uses. More particularly, it relates to recombinant plasmids which contain DNA fragments obtained by the restriction enzyme HindIII from chromosomal DNA s of thermo stable alpha amylase forming thermophilic Bacillus species and can replicate stably in hosts of thermophilic bacteria microorganisms transformed by said plasmids and a process for production of thermo stable alpha amylase by said microorganisms. The term thermophilic used in this specification means that such bacteria can grow and propagate at a temperature over 55 0C. Generally speaking, thermophilic bacteria have industrially useful advantages, for example, in operational safety, high growth rate, production of thermostable enzymes and reduced cooling cost during cultivation. Thus it has eagerly been hoped that a suitable combination of such hosts and vectors be developed for industrial applications. In this line of technical approach, the present authors have provided suitable vector plasmids which can be transferred into, and replicate stably in, thermophilic bacteria Gram positive or Gram staining unidentified . cf. Journal of Bacteriology, Vol. 149, No. 3, pp. 824 830, 1982 and JapanLaid Open Patent Publication No. 57 146799, 1982 . Using the methods described above for preparation of ve ctor plasmids, the present authors have studied to develop recombinant plasmids having practical use. As a result, this invention has been completed by recombining genes of thermo stable alpha amylase which are obtained by the restriction enzyme known per se from chromosomal DNA s of thermophilic Bacillus species, with vector plasmids prepared by the abovedescribed methods which can replicate stably in hosts of thermophilic bacteria Genes of thermo stable alpha amylase according to this invention may be obtained by various restriction enzymes known per se.In practice, however, HindIII is proved to be suitable for effective expression of alphaamylase activity, as the corresponding DNA fragment has an appropriate molecular weight and indude the carrier protein information signal sequence that is essential for excretion of protein products from cells.Any vector plasmids may be employed for recombination of said genes of thermo stable alphaamylase, irrespective of their origins and molecular weights, as far as they can replicate stably in hosts of thermophilic bacteria and have Hindill restriction sites. Examples of the vector plasmids are those which can replicate stably in thermophilic bacteria belonging to the genus Bacillus, such as pTBl9, pTB20 and their derivatives pub51, pTB52, pTB53, pTB90, etc. described in the preceding reference Journal of Bacteriology, Vol. 149, 824 830, 1982 .Particularly, pTB53 and pTB90 are the best vector plasmids for this invention, as they can incorporate said genes of thermo stable alphaamylase without damage of selection markers of kanamycin resistance cm and tetracycline resistance Tcr and have copy numbers of 1 9 plasmids per chromosome in hosts of Bacillus species. These vector plasmids were deposited under an accession No. FERM P 5895 with Fermentation Research Institute, Agency of Industrial Science dc Technology, Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Japan. Plasmid pTBl9 Kmr, Tcr can be easily prepared from microorganisms carrying pTB19 cm , Tcr by the method described in the above mentioned reference. The recombination of genes of thermo stable alpha amylase to vector plasmid can be carried out by the so called shotgun method using restriction enzyme and ligase known per se. The recombinant plasmids according to this invention are those which contain DNA fragments obtained by the restriction enzyme HindIII from chromosomal DNA s of thermo stable alpha amylase forming thermophilicBacillus species and can replicate stably in hosts of thermophilic bacteria.More particularly, the recombinant plasmids of this invention contain theDNA fragments obtained by the restriction enzyme HindIII which have a molecular weight of about 4.8 Md and the following restriction sites and products a 2 BamHI restriction sites DNA segments of 0.6, 2.1 and 2.1 Md b 3 EcoRI restrictlon sites DNA segments of 0.4, 0.8, 1.3 and 2.3 Md and c 2 PstI restriction sites DNA segments of 0.8, 0.8 and 3.2 Md.For example, recombinant plasmids designated pAT5 and pAT9 which were produced by the present authors by incorporating the above described DNA fragments into pTB53 and pTB90, respectively, are suitable, as they possess desirable properties for production of useful materials by genetic engineering techniques such as favorable copy number, type of drug resistance and restriction site. Figs. 1 and 2 show the cleavage maps of these plasmids by various restriction enzymes. These recombinant piasmids are useful not only for production of alpha amylase but also for use as vector plasmids for recombination of other DNA fragments1 because they include the signal sequence for carrier protein which is essential for production of thermo stable alpha amylase as well as for excretion of protein product from cells, as is shown in Figs. 1 and 2 and have the suitable BamHI, PstI and EcoRI restriction sites which are usable in cloning of DNA fragments other than amylase gene. The second embodiment of this invention relates to novel microorganisms which are obtained by transfer of the above described recombinant plasmids to thermophilic Bacillus species as hosts. Such microorganisms are very useful for manufacture of thermo stable alpha amylase. One example of such microorganisms is Bacillus stearothermophilus AN 174 pAT9 which was deposited under an accession No. FERM P 7047 with Fermentation Research Institute, Agency of Industrial Science dc Technology, April 22nd, 1983, and transferred to the international deposition under the Budapest Treaty and accorded the international deposit number FERM BP 479 on February 3, 1984. Except for the productivity of thermo stable alpha amylase, strain AN 174 and its parent, Bacillus stearothermophilus ATCC 12980, show almost identical microbiological properties. The third embodiment of this invention relates to the manufacture of thermo stable alpha amylase the abovementioned microorganisms. Media where bacteria belonging to the genus Bacillus can grow are used for production of thermo stable alpha amylase according to the present invention. For example, they may contain 4 10 carbon sources such as starch, soluble starch, dextrine and acid hydrolysate of starch and nitrogen sources such as soybean cake, soybean extract, dry yeast, milk casein, peptone, meat extract, corn steep liquor, peptide containing material and amino acid may be added singly or in combination in favorable amounts. If required, small amounts of inorganic salts are desirably supplemented.Thermo stable alpha amylase is produced by cultivating the abovedescribed microorganisms in such media at a pH of 6.5 7.3 and a temperature of 40 700C preferably 55 600C for a period of 24 72 hours under aerated agitation. Alpha amylase thus produced can be recovered from culture broths by a suitable combination of conventional methods. For example, concentration under reduced pressure precipitation with ammonium sulfate, sodium sulfate, sodium chloride and the like and solvent fractionation with methanol, acetone and the like are used solely or in suitable combination. Compared with conventional processes, the method of the present invention has industrial advantages in that the productivity of thermostable alpha amylase is markedly improved, as the gene of thermo stable alpha amylase is cloned and amplified in host microorganisms and that the thermophilic host microorganisms need no cooling during fermentation. In the following, the present invention will be explained in detail.Example 1 Isolation of alpha amvlase non producing strain One loopful of Bacillus stearothermoohilus CU21, a thermophilic bacterium the properties of this strain are described in Imanaka et awl.
