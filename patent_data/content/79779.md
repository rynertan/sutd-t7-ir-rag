## Description
HYDROCARBON CONVERSION CATALYSTS, . METHODS OF MAKiNG THEM AND THEIR USES IN HYDRUCARBON CONVERSION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to improved catalytic compositions having utility in hydrocarbon conversion processes. In a specific aspect, the invention relates to improved catalytic compositions having utility in hydrogen treating of hydrocarbon feed materials. Catalytic compositions containing a catalytically active metallic component deposed on a non zeolitic, refractory inorganic oxide support are well known as are numerous uses therefor. Familiar examples include petroleum and synthetic crude oil hydrotreating and hydrocracking catalysts comprising a Group VIB andor VIII metal such as cobalt, nickel, molybdenum and or tungsten deposed on a non zeolitic, refractory inorganic oxide such as alumina, silica, magnesia, etc. ad olefin polymerization catalysts comprising a Group VIB metal deposed on silica or silica alumina supports. It also is known that the activity or performance of catalysts of the type described hereinabove for reactions such as hydrocracking, disproportionation and oligomerization can be improved or modified by inclusion in the catalyst of a crystalline molecular sieve zeolite component. Thus U.S. 3,649,523 Bertolacini et al. discloses a hydrocarbon conversion process, and particularly hydrocracking and disproportionation of petroleum hydrocarbon feed materials, carried out in the presence of improved catalysts comprising a metallic component having hydrogenating activity deposed on a support component comprising a large pore crystalline aluminosilicate and a porous support material such as alumina, silica or aluminum phosphate. U.S.. 3,894,930 and U.S.4,054,539 both Hensley disclose hydrocracking in the presence of improved catalysts comprising a metallic hydrogenating component and a support component comprising ultrastable large pore crystalline aluminosilicate and silica alumina. U.S.3,876,522 Campbell et al. discloses preparation of lube oils by a process that includes a hydrocracking step in which there are employed catalysts containing a composite of a crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite component and a porous refractory oxide component such as alumina or silica, such composite containing deposited or exchanged catalytic metals U.S. 4,029,601 Wiese discloses oligomerization of alkenes using a cobalt oxide active carbon composite supported on a refractory oxide such as silica or alumina and or crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites. Other processes in which catalysts comprising catalytically active metals and a support component comprising a porous oxide and a crystalline molecular sieve zeolite are useful include isomerization of alkylaromatics and alkylation of aromatics and paraffins. Zt also is known that the performance of various catalysts. containing catalytically active metals deposed on a non zeolitic, refractory inorganic oxide support component can be improved or modified by inclusion of phosphorus in the catalytically active metallic component or through the use of phosphorus compounds in catalyst preparation. For example, U.S. 3,287,280 Colgan et al. discloses that the use of phosphoric acid solutions of nickel and or molybdenum salts to impregnate non zeolitic supports such as alumina or silica leads to improved dispersion of catalytically active metals on the support surface and improved results in hydrodesulfurization of petroleum hydrocarbon feeds. The patentee also discloses that phosphoric acid residues remaining in the catalyst impart thermal stability thereto..U.S. 3,840,472 Colgan contains a similar disclosure with respect to the use of phosphoric acid impregnating solutions of active metal salts.U.S. 4,165,274 Kwant discloses a two step process for hydrotreating and hydrocracking tar sands oils wherein hydrotreating takes place in a first stage in the presence of an alumina supported, fluorine and phosphorus containing nickel molybdenum catalyst, after which hydrocracking is conducted in the presence of a. catalyst containing nickel and tungsten supported on a low sodium, Y type molecular sieve support component. U.S. 3,985,676 Rekers et al. discloses catalysts for polymerization of olefines prepared by deposition of various organophosphorus compounds of chromium onto high surface area non zeolitic supports such as. silica or silica alumina followed by thermal activation of the result. Notwithstanding similarities in the basic catalytic composition catalytically active metal component deposed on non zeolitic refractory inorganic oxide support component into which phosphorus or crystalline molecular sieve zeolite components have been incorporated according to the above described proposals, the reported effects of the zeolite and phosphorus components are, in many respects, sufficiently unrelated as to mitigate against attempting to combine the effects of the components into a single catalyst. For example, the improved hydrocracking activity of the above described zeolitecontaining catalysts typically would not be desired in a hydrodesulfurization or hydrodenitrogenation catalyst because in typical hydrotreating processes employing such catalysts, it is preferred to limit cracking.Similarly, the improved hydrocesulfuri zation activity of phosphorus promoted catalysts such as those of Colgan et al. would be of little consequence within the context of a cracking, alkylation, isomerization or disproportionation process.On the other hand, we have previously found that a phosphorus component incorporated into the hydrogenating component of certain hydrotreating catalyst exerts a promotional effect with respect to denitrogenation of high nitrogen feeds while crystalline molecular sieve zeolite components incorporated into catalysts containing similar active metals but free of phosphorus exerts a promotional effect with respect to denitrogenation and hydrocracking reactions tt also is known from Rabo, Zeolite Chemistry and Catalysis, ACS Monograph 171, American ChemicalSociety, pages 294 297 1976 , that many crystalline molecular sieve zeolites possess only limited stability with respect to strong acids such as the phosphoric acid used according to Colgan et al. Accordingly, it can be speculated that attempts to combine the promotional effects of phosphoric acid and crystalline molecular sieve zeolites have been limited by concern over destruction of the zeolite component. U.S. 3,617,528 Hilfman , which is directed to preparation of supported nickel containing catalysts by coextrusion of a phosphoric acid solution of nickel or nickel and Group VIB metal compounds and an alumina containing carrier, suggests the use of carriers containing silica and alumina that are amorphous or zeolitic in nature. Column 2 lines 39 43. Crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites specifically disclosed by Hilfman are mordenite, faujasite and Types A and U molecular sieves. Column 3 lines 42 46. Hilfman does not address the effect of the acid on zeolite integrity or crystallinity, nor is there any disclosure or suggestion as to whether any zeolite employed in the disclosed preparations would remain intact in the final catalyst.In fact, none of the disclosed crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites, or any other for that matter, is employed in the patentee s examples. Further, U.S. 3,706,693 Mickelson et al. 693 and U.S. 3,725,243 Hass et al. teach that exposure of zeolites to strong acids such as phosphoric acid destroys zeolite crystallinity and integrity. In fact, both Mickelson et al. 693 and Hasps et al. are directed specifically to catalyst preparations in which impregnation of crystalline aluminosilicate containing supports with phosphoric acid solutions of salts of hydrogenating metals results in destruction of zeolite crystallinity.Further, three of the four crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites specifically disclosed by Hilfman faujasite, mordenite and Type A molecular sieve are included among the crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites that are preferred for use in Mickelson et al. s andHasps et al. s zeolite destructive preparations.The aforesaid Rabo publication teaches that amongZeolite A, faujasite and mordenite, only the latter exhibits appreciable acid stability. u.S. 3,905,914 Jurewicz et al. is directed to preparation of oxidation catalysts by mixing a vanadium compound, zirconium salt and hydrogen halide, and then adding phosphoric acid or a compound hydrolyzable to phosphoric acid. The result is refluxed to form a gel which then is dried, or used to impregnate a suitable carrier, such as alumina, alundum, silica, silicon carbide, silica alumina, zirconia, zirconium phosphate and or a zeolite. Column 2 lines 47 51. Jurewicz et al. does not identify any zeolites nor do the patentees examples illustrate preparation of a supported catalyst. Also, no consideration is given to acid stability of zeolites and there is no indication whether any zeolite used in the disclosed catalyst preparation would remain intact. Similar to the Mickelson et al. 693 and Hass et al. patents discussed hereinabove, U.S. 3,749,663, 3,749,664 and 3,755,150 all Mickelson are directed to impregnation of support materials with phosphoric acid solutions of salts of catalytically active metals Although none of these patents discloses impregnation of support materials containing a zeolite component, each patent expressly cautions against exposure of supports containing aluminum ions to phosphoric acid at relatively low pH stating that reaction of the acid and aluminum degrades the support, fouls the impregnation solution and results in formation of undesirable chemical forms in the finished catalyst. See Mickelson 663 at Column 8 lines 60 69, Mickelson 664 at Column 8 lines 6 15,Mickelson 150 at Column 9 lines 12 21. U,S.. 3,836,561 Young also deals with acid treatment of crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites.According to Young, alumina containing compositions, including those containing crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites, are reacted with aqueous acids including hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric and various organic acids, at a pH below 5 in the presence of an ionizable salt that is soluble in the aqueous phase, and then the result is washed, dried and calcined. The result of such treatment is removal of aluminum from the alumina containing composition, replacement thereof with metallic cations if the ionizable salt is one containing cations that can be exchanged into the zeolite, increased porosity and decreased bulk volume of the catalyst.The resulting compositions are said to have utility as absorbents, ion exchange resins, catalysts and catalyst supports. Acid stable zeolites and the effects of acid treatment on zeolite crystallinity are discussed at Column 2 lines 61 68. Of course,Young s acid treatment differs from the use of phosphoric acid according to the patents discussed hereinabove in that Young s purpose is to remove aluminum from the composition rather than to incorporate phosphorus into it. It also differs from the patents discussed hereinabove in that the disclosed compositions lack a catalytically active metallic component deposed on the alumina containing carrier. Other patents and publications that may be of interest to the present invention in disclosing treatment of crystalline molecular sieve zeolites or compositions containing the same with phosphoric acid and other phosphorus compounds to incorporate phosphorus into the zeolite are U.S. 3,962,364 Young and U.S. 4,274,982, 4,276,437 and 4,276,438 allChu According to these patents, suitable phosphorus compounds include halides, oxyhalides, oxyacids, and organophosphorus compounds such as phosphines, phosphites and phosphates. Incorporation of phosphorus according to these patents is reported to improve para selectivity in alkylation reactions. Chu 982 further discloses treatment of the phosphoruscontaining zeolites with magnesium compounds. Chu 437 discloses impregnation of the phosphorus treated compositions with solutions of gallium, iridium or thallium compounds.Chu 438 contains a similar disclosure with respect to impregnation of compounds of silver, gold and copper. Both patents disclose use of acid solutions of the metals as impregnating solutions, with hydrochloric, sulfuric and nitric as well as various organic acids being disclosed.None of these patents discloses or suggests the use of phosphoric acid impregnating solutions nor is there any suggest ion of a catalyst containing an active metallic component which contains phosphorus,Rather, the respective patentees phosphorus is incorporated into the zeolite. British 1,555,928 Kouwenhaven et al. discloses crystalline silicates of specified formula having utility in a wide range of hydrocarbon conversions.Impregnation of the silicates with catalytic metals is disclosed as is promotion or modification with halogens, magnesium, phosphorus, boron, arsenic or antimony, Page 6 lines 33 54 with incorporation of phosphorus into the silicate to improve alkylation selectivity, as in the above described Chu patents, being specifically disclosed It also is known that phosphine or other organophosphorus complexes of various metal salts can be employed in preparation of various supported catalyst compositions. For example, U.S. 3,703,561 Kubicek et al. discloses catalysts for olefin disproportionation comprising a reaction product of 1 an organoaluminum halide, aluminum halide or combination thereof with each other or with another organometallic halide and 2 a mixture of a salt of copper, silver or gold with a complexing agent which may be an organophosphine. Reaction of components 1 and 2 is conducted in the presence of a solvent for the reactants, in the substantial absence of air and at temperatures low enough to avoid decomposition of the reactants. It also is disclosed to provide the catalysts in supported form by impregnating a support such as a non zeolitic, refractory inorganic oxide or a zeolite with the reaction product, or by impregnation with one of the reactants followed by addition of the other. Kubicek et al. also states that if such supported catalysts are to be activated by calcination the calcination should take place prior to impregnation with the active species, i.e., the reaction product of components 1 and 2 . It is unclear whether residues of any organophosphine compound used in preparation of the catalysts ofKubicek et al. would remain in association with the active metallic species.In any event, the catalyst preparation according to this patent is conducted under conditions designed to avoid conversion of any such organophosphine residues to an oxygenated phosphorus component such as that required according to the present invention. U.S. 3,721,718 Hughes et al. and U.S.4,010,217 Zuech contain disclosures similar to that of Kubicek et al. with respect to use of organophosphorus complexes of various metal salts in preparation of olefin disproportination catalysts. LikeKubicek et al., both Hughes et al. and Zuech contemplate supported catalysts however, both patentees also state that if activation by calcination is desired, it should be accomplished by calcination of support prior to incorporation of active metals. Another patent disclosing the use of metal complexes in catalyst preparation is U.S. 3,849,457 Haag et al. which is directed to preparation of carboxylic acids by hydrogenolysis of esters. T ne catalysts of Haag et al. comprise a hydrogenating metal component and a solid acid component such as a zeolite which components may be employed as a loose physical admixture or by combining the two components into a single particle. Various methods for combining the two components into a single particle are disclosed at Column 6 line 64 Column 7 line 44. One of these involves mixing a solution of a metal pi complex with the acid solid and then decomposing the complex to form elemental metal and depositing the elemental metal onto the acid solid. A specific metal complex employed in this preparative scheme is tetra triphenylphosphine palladium II dibromide. Another preparative method useful with respect to zeolitic acid solid components involves incorporation of the hydrogenation component by conventional methods such as ion exchange or impregnation. None of the disclosed methods would result in association of an oxygenated phosphorus component with the metallic component of the patentees catalyst. U.S., 4,070,403 Homeier discloses a hydroformylation catalyst comprising a cobalt compound and a. zeolite alumina hydrosol dispersion. The cobalt compound is chemically bonded to the aluminazeolite dispersion by a vapor phase impregnation technique.Suitable cobalt components, of the disclosed catalysts include various salts such as halides t nitrate and various carboxylates as well as organophosphine complexes. Homer does not disclose or suggest the presence of an oxygenated phosphorus component in the final catalyst, nor does the patentee attribute any promotional effect to phosphorus It can be appreciated from the foregoing that efforts to include both a crystalline molecular sieve zeolite component and a phosphorus component in catalysts comprising an active metal component deposed on a non zeolitic refractory inorganic oxide component in such a manner that the promotional effects of both the phosphorus and the zeolite are retained have been largely unsuccessful.In those instances in which an attempt has been made to incorporate a promoting phosphorus component through the use of phosphoric acid impregnating solutions of compounds of active metals, such use of phosphoric acid in conjunction with a crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite containing composition often results in destruction of the crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite component.Other proposals such as those involving use of organophosphorus complexes of various metal salts to aid impregnation or deposition of active metals into or onto support result in only incidental, if any, incorporation of phosphorus into the final catalyst, and phosphorus so incorporated appears lacking in promotional effect It would be desirable to provide an improved catalytic composition in which both phosphorus and crystalline molecular sieve zeolite components are present in a form capable of exerting a promotional effect. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved catalytic composition. A further object of the invention is to provide for the use of such catalytic compositions in hydrocarbon conversion processes.A still further object is to provide for the preparation of catalysts in which improved performance is attained through incorporation of crystalline molecular sieve zeolite and phosphorus components. Other objects of the invention will be apparent to persons skilled in the art from the following description and the appended claims. We have now found that the objects of this invention can be attained by incorporation of an oxygenated phosphorus component into the catalytically active metallic component of a catalytic composition and incorporation of selected crystalline molecular sieve zeolite components into the support component of the composition. Advantageously, the crystalline molecular sieve zeolite components of the invented catalysts are derived from acid tolerant crystalline molecular sieve zeolites, and accordingly, phosphorus component can be incorporated without substantial destruction of zeolite integrity or crystallinity. Further, the phosphorus component is incorporated into the metallic component in a form capable of exerting a promotional effect. Thus, as demonstrated in the examples appearing hereinbelow, the catalysts of the invention, wherein an oxygenated phosphorus component is incorporated into a catalytically active metallic component which is deposed on or associated with a support component comprising at least one crystalline molecular sieve zeolite component and a non zeolitic, refractory inorganic oxide matrix component, are superior to catalyst compositions that are identical but for the inclusion of a phosphor us component, or but for inclusion of the zeolite component, in a variety of catalytic processes. Aecordingly, the overall effect of the phosphorus and zeolite components on performance of the basic catalytically active composition comprising a metallic component and a non zeolitic, refractory inorganic oxide component is greater than the effect of either component alone in a variety of reactions. In addition to the patents and publications discussed hereinabove, U.S. 4,228,036 Swift et al. and UtS, 4,277,373 Sawyer et al. may be of interest to the present invention in disclosing catalytic compositions containing phosphorus and zeolite components. Specifically, Swift et al.discloses an improved catalytic cracking catalyst comprising an alumina aluminum phosphate silica matrix composited with a zeolite component having cracking activity, such as a rare earth exchangedY type crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite. Swift et al. does not disclose inclusion of an active metallic component into such catalysts. Further, in contrast to the catalysts of the present invention, wherein an oxygenated phosphorus component is included in an active metallic component, the phos phorus component of Swift et al. s catalysts is included in a refractory oxide material. Sawyer et al. discloses hydroprocessing catalysts comprising a Group VIB and or VIII metal component composited with an ultrastable Y type crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite and an alumina aluminum fluorophosphate component. The catalyst also may contain an alumina gel containing matrix. Although an essential component of Sawyer et al. s catalyst is the aluminum fluorophosphate component of the support, it also is to be noted. that patentee. discloses use of phosphomolybdic acid to impregnate a support containing a Y type crystalline aluminosilicate and alumina aluminum fluorophosphate inExample 1 see Column 5 lines 21 25 .According to the example, however, it appears that there was no incorporation of a phosphorus component into the active metal component of the catalyst because the table at Column 5 lines 42 52 fails to report phosphorus content other than that contained in the aluminum fluorophosphate component of the support.Table 2 of Sawyer et al. also reports on a comparative catalyst C containing specified levels of alumina, Y type zeolite, nickel oxide, molybdenum oxide, and phosphorus pentoxide. For catalyst C to have been a fair comparator for the catalysts of Sawyer et al. s invention, the phosphorus pentoxide component must have been present in a manner similar to the fluorophosphate component of the patentees catalysts, i.e., as part of the support. As such, Sawyer et al. fails to disclose or suggest a catalyst containing phosphorus as an essential part of the active metal component. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Briefly, the catalyst composition of this invention comprises 1 an active metallic component comprising at least one metal having hydrocarbon conversion activity and at least one oxygenated phosphorus component and 2 a support component comprising at least one non zeolitic, refractory inorganic oxide matrix component and at least one crystalline molecular sieve zeolite component.According to a further aspect of the invention, such catalytic compositions are prepared by a method comprising 1 impregnating a support component comprising at least one non zeolitic, refractory inorganic oxide matrix component and at least one acid tolerant, crystalline molecular sieve zeolite component with percursors to an active metallic component comprising at least one metal having hydrocarbon conversion activity and at least one oxygenated phosphorus component under conditions effective to retain substantial zeolite crystallinity and 2 calcining the result to convert active metallic component precursors to active form.According to a still further aspect of the invention, the abovedescribed catalytic compositions are employed in hydrocarbon conversion processes in which a hydrocarbon containing chargestock is contacted with the catalytic composition under hydrocarbon conversion conditions In greater detail, the invented catalytic composition comprises an active metallic component and a support component. Relative proportions of these are not critical so long as the active metallic component is present in at least a catalytically effective amount. Optimum proportions for a given catalyst will vary depending on intended use. Usefully, the active metallic component constitutes 5 to 50 wt and the support constitutes 50 to 95 wt , such weight percentages being based upon total weight of the catalytic composition. The active metallic component of the invented catalyst comprises at least one metal having hydrocarbon conversion activity and at least one oxygenated phosphorus component. Suitable metals having hydrocarbon conversion activity include any of the metals typically employed to catalyze hydrocarbon conversion reactions such as those of Groups IB, II t IIIB VIIB and VIII. These can be present in the catalyst in elemental form, as oxides, as sulfides, or in other active forms. Combinations also are contemplated.The Group VIB metals exhibit a high degree of susceptibility to promotion by oxygenated phosphorus component. Accordingly, preferred compositions are those in which the active metallic component comprises at least one Group VIB metal. For a given catalyst, the preferred metal or combination of metals of the active metallic component will vary depending on end use. For example, in hydrogen processing of hydrocarbon feed materials such as petroleum or synthetic crude oils, coal or biomass liquids, or fractions thereof, preferred metals are those of Groups VIB and VIII such as chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, nickel, cobalt, iron, platinum, rhodium, palladium, iridium and combinations thereof. Oxides and sulfides of these are most preferred from the standpoint of catalytic performance. In processes for denitrogenation hydrotreating or denitrogenation hydrocracking, combinations of nickel or cobalt with molybdenum and chromium give particularly good results.Particularly good results in hydrocracking processes are attained using catalysts containing combinations of cobalt and molybdenum, nickel and molybdenum, or nickel and tungsten as the metals of the active metallic component. In mild hydrocracking processes such as catalytic. dewaxing and catalytic cracker feed hydrocracking processes, preferred metals of the metallic component are combinations of nickel and molybdenum. In addition to the above described catalytically active metal component, the active metallic component of the invented composition contains at least one oxygenated phosphorus component which may be present in a variety of forms such as one or more simple oxides, phosphate anions, complex species in which phosphorus is linked through oxygen to one or more metal or metals of the active metallic component or compounds of such metal or metals, or combinations of these. The specific form of the oxygenated phosphorus component is not presently known accordingly, for purposes hereof, phosphorus contents are calculated and expressed in terms of P2O5. Content of the metal and phosphorus components of the active metallic component is not critical although phosphorus component preferably is present in at least an amount effective to promote hydrocarbon conversion activity of the metal or metals of the metallic component. In general, the metal or metals of the metallic component, calculated as oxide of the metal or metals in a common oxidation state, e.g., Cr203, MoO3, W03, NiO, CoO, make up 3 to 45 wt.t of the total catalyst weight while phosphorus component, expressed as P205, makes up 0.1 to 20 wt. of the total catalyst.Within these broad ranges, preferred levels of metal and phosphorus component will vary depending on end use. For example, catalysts useful in hydrogen processing of petroleum or synthetic crude oils, coal or biomass liquids, or fractions thereof preferably contain 5 to 35 wt. Group VIB and or VIII metal, expressed as common metal oxide, and 0.5 to 15 wt. oxygenated phosphorus component, expressed as P2O5. Of course, higher and lower levels of metal and or phosphorus component can be present however, below 5 wt. metal oxide, hydrogenation activity can suffer while above 35 wt. , improvements in activity typically do not compensate for the cost of the additional metal.Similarly, below 0.5 wt. phosphorus component, calculated as P205, promotional effect may be insignificant while above 15 wt. , the phosphorus component may adversely affect hydrogenation activity or performance. For high nitrogen feedstocks, the hydrogenating metal preferably makes up 10 to 40 wt. of overall catalyst while phosphorus content as P205 makes up 0.5 to 15 of overall catalyst weight. For mild hydrocracking, hydrogenating metal preferably makes up 5 to 30 wt. of overall catalyst weight while phosphorus content as P205 makes up 0.1 to 10 wot. of overall catalyst weight. The support component of the invented catalytic composition comprises a non zeolitic, refractory inorganic oxide matrix component and at least one crystalline molecular sieve zeolite component. Suitable non zeolitic, refractory inorganic oxide matrix components are well known to persons skilled in the art and include alumina, silica, silica alumina, alumina silica, magnesia, zirconia, titania, etc., and combinations thereof. The matrix component also can contain adjuvants such as phosphorus oxides, boron oxides, fluorine and or chlorine. Matrix components that are preferred are those comprising alumina, owing to the availability and strength thereof. More preferably, the matrix component is alumina, or a combination of alumina and silica. The support component of the invented catalytic composition also comprises at least one crystalline molecular sieve zeolite component. This component of the support component is derived from at least one acid tolerant crystalline molecular sieve zeolite.For purposes hereof, an acid tolerant crystalline molecular sieve zeolite is defined as one that retains substantial crystallinity on exposure to phosphoric acid at pH down to about 3 to 4 and contains sufficiently low levels of cations capable of reacting with aqueous phosphoric acid to form insoluble metal phosphates capable of plugging the zeolite s pores as to avoid substantial plugging. Both naturally occurring and synthetic zeolites are contemplated.As with the metals of the metallic component of the invented catalysts, the specific zeolite component to be included in a given catalyst will vary depending on intended use of the catalytic composition.Examples of acid tolerant, crystalline molecular sieve zeolites include faujasite type crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites selected from the ultrastableY type crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites in acid and ammonium forms, AMS type crystalline borosilicate zeolites, ZSM type crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites and mordenite type crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites. The ultrastable crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites typically are faujasite type zeolites that exhibit improved stability at elevated temperatures, such stability being imparted by exchanging original alkali metal cations with ammonium salt, calcining to convert the zeolite to hydrogen form, steaming or calcining again, exchanging with ammonium salt once again and finally calcining. Specific examples of ultrastable Y type crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites include zeolite Z l4US, which is described in detail in U.S. 3,293,192 Maher et al. and U.S.3,449,070 McDaniel et al. , both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Y type crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites in hydrogen or ammonium form also exhibit sufficient acid tolerance as to be suitable for purposes of the present invention.When used in preparation of catalysts, Y type zeolites in ammonium form are converted to acid form.

Specific examples of crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites of the ZSM type include crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite ZSM 5, which is described in detail in U.S. 3,702,886 crystalline aluminosilicate ZSM 11, which is described in detail in U.S. 3,709,979 crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite ZSM 12, which is described in detail in U.S. 3,832,449 crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite ZSM 35, which is described in detail in U.S. 4,016,245 and crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite ZSM 38, which is described in detail in U.S. 4,046,859. All of the aforesaid patents are incorporated herein by reference. Mordenite type crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites also can be present in the catalytic compo sition of the present invention. Suitable mordenite type crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites are dis closed in U.S. 3,247,098 Kimberline , U.S. 3,281,483 Benesi et al. and U.S. 3,299,153 Adams et al. , each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Synthetic mordenite structure crystalline aluminosil icate zeolites1 such as those designated Zeolon and available from the Norton Company of Worcester,Massachusetts, also are contemplated according to the invention. Synthetic crystalline molecular sieve zeolites often are synthesized in alkali metal form, i.e., having alkali metal cations associated with framework species For purposes of the present invention, the original form as well as various exchanged forms such as the hydrogen acid , ammonium and metalexchanged forms are suitable. Crystalline molecular sieve zeolites can be converted to acid form by exchange with acids or by indirect means which typically involve contacting with ammonium or amine salts to form ammonium exchanged intermediate species which can be calcined to acid form. Metal exchanged zeolites are well known as are methods for preparation thereof. Typically, zeolite is contacted with a solution or solutions containing metal cations capable of associating with framework metallic species.As noted hereinabove, crystalline molecular sieve zeolite components present in the catalysts of the present invention contain only insubstantial levels of metals capable of reacting with aqueous phosphoric acid to form insoluble metal phosphates capable of plugging the pores of the support component. Accordingly, preferred metal exchangeÅa crystalline molecular sieve zeolites are those in which the exchanged metals are nickel, cobalt, iron or a Group VIII noble metal. In catalysts intended for use in hydrogen processing of petroleum or synthetic crude oils, coal or biomass liquids, or fractions thereof, preferred crystalline molecular sieve zeolite components of the invented catalysts are those in acid or polyvalent metal ion exchanged form, and especially the former. Content of non zeolitic, porous refractory inorganic acid matrix component and crystalline molecular sieve zeolite component in the support component of the invented composition are not critical. Broadly, the matrix component constitutes 5 to 95 wt of the support, and likewise, the zeolite component can constitute 5 to 95 wt of the support Preferably, the content of the non zeolitic matrix component is at least 10 wt in order to ensure that the support component will exhibit sufficient strength and physical integrity to allow shaping of the component or final catalyst into a form suitable for intended use Of course, even at less than 10 wt mat rix component, suitable catalytic performance can be attained in applications amenable to use of catalyst in finely divided form. In terms of overall catalyst weight of the invented catalytic Pomposition, preferred matrix content ranges from 10 to 90 wt and preferred zeolite content ranges from 5 to 90 wt, Within these ranges, precise levels of matrix and zeolite components that are more preferred for a given catalyst will vary depending on intended use. For use in mild hydrocracking, the matrix component content preferably ranges from 40 to 95 wt.t of the support while zeolite content ranges from 5 to 60 wt. of the support component. The support component of the invented catalytic composition can be prepared by any suitable method.A preferred method comprises blending acid tolerant zeolitic component, preferably in finely divided form, into a sol, hydrosol or hydrogel of at least one inorganic oxide and adding a gelling medium such as ammonium hydroxide with stirring to produce a gel. It also is contemplated to add the zeolite component to a slurry of the matrix component. In either case, the result can be dried, shaped if desired, and then calcined to form the support component Suitable drying temperatures range from 27 to 1770C 80 to 350oF and suitable drying times range from seconds to several hours. Calcination preferably is conducted at a temperature of 427 to 6490C 00 to 1,2000F for 1 2 to 16 hours.Shaping of the support component can be conducted if desired, preferably after drying or calcining. Another suitable method for preparing the support component of the invented composition comprises physically mixing particles of the matrix and zeolite components, each preferably in finely divided form, followed by thorough blending of the mixture. The invented catalytic composition is prepared by a method comprising 1 impregnating the abovedescribed support component with precursors to the active metallic component under conditions effective to retain substantial zeolite crystallinity and 2 calcining the result. Impregnation of support component with precursors to the active metallic component can be conducted in a single step or in a series of separate steps which may be separated by drying and or calcination steps, provided that impregnation with at least one metal precursor takes place prior to or simultaneously with impregnation with. phosphorus component precursor.If the active metallic component contains more than one metal, precursors can be impregnated simultaneously, in sequence or by various combinations of simultaneous and sequential impregnations. Phosphorus component precursor or precursors can be included with one or more of the metal precursors, or one or more separate phosphorus component precursor impregnation steps can be included between or after the metal precursor impregnation steps. It also is contemplated to impregnate either the porous refractory inorganic oxide matrix component or the zeolitic component with precursors to the active metallic component and blend the result with the other component. The mechanics of impregnating a support with metallic component precursors are well known to persons skilled in the art and typically involve contacting a support with one or more solutions of one or more precursors in amounts and under conditions effective to yield a final composition containing the desired amount of metal or metals. Suitable solvents for the impregnating solution or solutions include water and various low boiling alcohols in which the precursors are soluble. Water is preferred over alcohols from the standpoint of cost. In the case of simultaneous impregnations of metal and phosphorus component precursors a more preferred solvent is aqueous phosphoric acid. Metal precursors useful in preparation of the invented catalytic compositions are well known to persons skilled in the art and include a wide range of salts and compounds of the metals that are soluble in the impregnating solvent and convertible to the desired form on calcination. Examples of useful salts include organic acid salts such as acetates, formates and propionates nitrates anhydrides sulfates and ammonium salts. Useful precursors to the oxygenated phosphorus component are materials capable of reaction with the metal or metals of the metallic component, or compounds of such metal or metals, or precursors thereto, so as to incorporate into the metallic component or metallic component precursor a phosphorus containing species that can be converted to an oxygenated phosphorus component. From the standpoint of maximizing the promotional effect of the oxygenated phosphorus component, the preferred phosphorus component precursor is one containing or capable of liberating phosphate anions as these are sufficiently reactive with the metal or metal precursors to yield the desired promotional effect. Specific examples of such phosphorus anion sources include phosphoric acid and salts thereof such as ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and diammonium hydrogen phosphate.Other phosphorus component precursors contemplated according to the invention, though less preferred from the standpoint of attaining maximum promotional effect, include organophosphorus compounds such as partial and full esters of the aforesaid oxyacids such as organophosphates and organophosphites other organophosphorus compounds such as phosphines and other phosphoric oxyacids such as phosphorus and phosphinic acids. Impregnation of the support component with precursors to the metallic component is conducted under conditions effective to avoid substantial destruction of crystallinity of the crystalline molecular sieve zeolite component. Preferably, such conditions include a temperature that is high enough to maintain the metal and or phosphorus component precursors in solution in the impregnating solvent though not so high as to decompose such precursors or have substantial adverse effects on the support component. More preferably, impregnating temperatures range from 4.5 to 939C 40 to 2000F .pH of the impregnating solution or solutions to be used also is important from the standpoint of insuring retention of substantial zeolite crystallinity when phosphoric acid or other phosphate anion source is employed as a phosphorus component precursor and or impregnating solvent. In such cases, pH preferably is sufficiently high that only insubstantial destruction of zeolite crystallinity takes place during the preparation Of course, the precise pH at which substantial decomposition of crystallinity will occur will vary somewhat depending upon the choice of zeolite component In general, however, pH should be above 2 in order to insure retention of sufficient zeolite crystallinity to insure desirable catalytic performance Most preferably, pH ranges from 2.5 to e in order to insure retention of a high degree of zeolite crystallinity while also insuring the desired association of the phosphorus and metal components of the active metallic component. Following impregnation of the support component with metallic component precursors, it is prefered to dry the impregnated support. It also is contemplated to dry the support subsequent to any intermediate impregnating steps in a multistep impregnation.Preferred drying temperatures range from 27 to 1770C to 3500F , with preferred drying times ranging from a few seconds in spray drying operations to several hours in conventional driers. Following impregnation of the support with precursors to the metallic component and any optional drying steps, the impregnated support is subjected to calcination in order to convert at least a portion of the metal or metals of the metallic component to the active form and to convert phosphorus precursors to oxygenated phosphorus component. Calcination is conducted in an atmosphere containing molecular oxygen at a temperature and for a period of time effective to attain the desired conversion. Preferably, calcination temperatures range from 427 to 6490C 800 to 1,2000F . Preferred calcination times range from 1 2 to 16 hours. As a result of the above described preparation, there is attained a catalytic composition comprising 1 a metallic component comprising at least one metal having hydrocarbon conversion activity and at least one oxygenated phosphorus component, and 2 a support component comprising at least one nonzeolitic, refractory inorganic oxide matrix component and at least one crystalline molecular sieve zeolite component. Preferred compositions are those in which the zeolite component exhibits at least 40 crystallinity as compared to compositions identical but for inclusion of phosphorus component. More preferably, such relative crystallinity is at least 75 in order to ensure desirable catalyst performance. The compositions of this invention have utility in a wide range of hydrocarbon conversion processes in which a chargestock comprising hydrocarbon is contacted with the catalyst under hydrocarbon conversion conditions. The invented catalysts are particularly useful in processes for hydrogen processing of hydrocarbon feed materials such as whole petroleum or synthetic crude oils, coal or biomass liquids, and fractions thereof. The process of the invention is described in further detail with reference to hydrogen processing of such feed materials.

Mild hydrocracking conditions vary somewhat depending on the choice of feed as well as the type of processing to be conducted. Dewaxing mild hydrocracking conditions are employed when it is desired to reduce n paraffin and isoparaffin content of the feed without substantial cracking of desirable aromatics, naphthenes and branched paraffins. Dewaxing mild hydrocracking conditions preferably include a tempt rature of 343 to 4270C, t650 to e000F , hydrogen pressure of 5.5 to 17.3 I.Pa 800 to 2500 psi , linear hourly space velocity LHSV of 0.2 to 5 and hydrogen addition rate of 178 to 3560 M3 m3 l000 to 20,000 standard cubic feet per barrel SCFB .

EXAMPLE 9 A series of catalyst compositions was prepared from various crystalline molecular sieve zeolite and matrix components and aqueous phosphoric acid solutions of various metal salts pH about 3 according to the general procedure of Examples 1 5. A second series of catalysts was prepared in similar fashion to contain identical levels of metals and support components but no phosphorus pH about 5 . Samples of the catalysts were analyzed by Xray diffraction to determine the effect of phosphoric acid on retention of zeolite crystallinity. For each pair of catalysts with and without phosphoric and impregnation of identical metals and support content, intensity of one or more X ray bands characteristic of the zeolite component and not subject to interference by the metals of the catalysts were measured. For each pair of catalysts, composition and crystallinity of the phosphorus component containing catalyst relative to that of the phosphorus free composition is reported in Table 4.
