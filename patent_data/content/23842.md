# Reversible plough.

## Abstract
A reversible plough has a headstock formed from upper and lower parts 7, 3 hingedly connected about a transverse axis 9 , the reversing spindle 17 being mounted in the lower headstock part 3 and carrying a crank arm 21 connected by a link 23 to the upper headstock part 7 . As the reversing spindle is rotated, relative hinging movement between the two headstock parts causes the reversing spindle to tilt in a vertical plane, the load in said link 23 counterbalancing to a degree the offset centre of gravity of the plough frame and reducing the torque required to reverse the plough frame.
