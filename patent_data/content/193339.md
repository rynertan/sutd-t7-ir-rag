# A force Multiplier.

## Abstract
In this invention, there is disclosed a force multiplier being comprised of a base supporting member 21 , a driving lever 22 being supported swingably by a first pivot means A on said base supporting member which is reciprocated about the first pivot means through a predetermined angle x being defined between first and second positions thereof, a driven lever 23 one end of which is pivotably coupled to the free end of the driving lever 22 by a second pivot means B , a follower F being coupled to the other end of the driven lever which receives a multiplied force and transmits it to other member, said follower F being supported remote from the second pivot means B by a distance substantially equal to the distance defined between the first and second pivot means, and a guide means 24 ,25, 26 for guiding the follower F coupled to the driven lever which makes the driven lever 23 swing about the second pivot B .
