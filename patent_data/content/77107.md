An arrangement for the display of individually se lectable map background pictures combined with an over lay of selectable predefined and or operated generated symbols. The arrangement comprises a video disc player with a video disc carrying the map pictures and a com puter in which symbol generative data of the predefined symbols are stored. A picture generator transforms the mixer combines the video signals of a map picture res symbol generated data into a video signal and a video pectively symbol generative data such that the symbol picture non transparently covers the map picture. The combined signal is displayed on a colour monitor. The video disc allows for rapid access to a large number of maps and the generation of the overlay information re quires only a limited computer capacity. The arrangement is specifically useful for rapid and flexible indications of military operations.
