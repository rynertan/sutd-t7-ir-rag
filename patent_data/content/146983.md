# POLYMERS OF CAPROLACTAM HAVING HIGH IMPACT STRENGTH

## Abstract
Polymers of caprolactam, having high impact strength, obtained by means of anionic polymerization, containing a rubbery phase distributed homogeneously inside the polym er consisting of alternating copolyesteramides with elas tomeric properties, and related production process, consist ing in dissolving or swelling the elastomeric phase in monomer caprolactam, and submitting the mixture to a polymerization at temperatures variable within the range of from 120 C to 160 C, in the presence of a basic initiator, and of an activator.
