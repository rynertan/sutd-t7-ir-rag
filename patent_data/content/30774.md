# Method for manufacturing a die.

## Abstract
A method for manufacturing an element with a conduct ing surface and a pattern of insulating spots, to be used as a die for the electrolytic production of sieves for screen printing, said method starting from a conducting surface consisting of or coated with a material that either possesses insulating properties or can be rendered insulating after heating, said surface being patternwise irradiated with short pulses of a high energy radiation, such that counter sunk spots of an insulating substance are obtained on said surface.
