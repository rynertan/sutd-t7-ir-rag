# GROWING HIGH RESISTIVITY QUATERNARY MATERIAL BY LIQUID PHASE EPITAXY

## Abstract
Iron has too low a solubility to be a convenient dopant for producing high resistivity blocking material by liquid phase epitaxy in the construction of InP and InGaAsP semiconductor devices. Manganese is used in its stead in conjunction with a donor such as germanium to act as partial compensation in view of the fact that the acceptor level of manganese in InP is not as deep as that of iron.
