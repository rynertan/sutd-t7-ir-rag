# Forceps.

## Abstract
A pair of forceps has a shank 6 and a pair of resilient arms 2 and 4 . A groove 14,16 running along the inner face of each arm 2,4 and communicating with a channel 18 in the shank, accommodates a fibre optic cable which provides illumination at the tip of the forceps for items handled by the forceps. The use of such forceps is particularly suitable for ma nipulating an artificial lens in a human eye because the sur face of the lens is illuminated to make it stand out against the liquid of the eye which has substantially the same re fractive index as the lens.
