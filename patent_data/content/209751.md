## Description
The present invetnion relates to new cephalosporin compounds. These compounds have a broad bactericidal spectrum against various bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and an excellent remedial effect for pathogenic diseases of human and animals and therefore are useful as medicines for human and animals. Cephalosporin antibiotics are widely used for the remedy of diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria, and these are said to be effective for the remedy of diseases caused by such bacteria as tolerant to any other antibiotics such as penicillin type antibiotics. Regarding the remedial effect of these antibiotics in clinical use, however, the effect can hardly be said sufficient even in the case of so called cephem type antibiotics of the third generation which have recently been developed as antibiotics against gram negative bacteria including opportunistic pathogens. For instance, cephalosporin derivatives in which the 2 amino group in the 7 aminothiazolylglycyl group is amidated with dihydroxybenzoic acid to form an amido substituted compound are noted to have a strong bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa refer to Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 139387 84 the term OPI as used herein means an unexamined published application , but these are defective as being easily O methylated and deactivated in a living body. Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 118792 84 discloses one example of cephalosporin antibiotics, in which the 2 amino group in the 7 aminothiazolylglycyl group is amidated into 5 hydroxy 4 pyridone 2 carboxamide derivative. However, this essentially discloses carbacephem type antibiotics, and any concrete exmaples of 1,5 dihydroxy 4 pyridone 2 carboxamide substituents of the present invention are not described at all in said patent publication. The synthesis of the 1,5 dihydroxy 4 pyridone 2 carboxylic acid, which is one constitutional element in the 7 positioned substituent of the derivatives of the present invention, is not so easy. This is because N aminopyridone compounds can hardly be obtained by the reaction of a kojic acid and a hydrazine refer to Agr. Biol. Chem , Vol. 31, pp. 979 989, written by I.Ichimoto, et al. in 1967 and thus, when a pyrone ring is reacted with a hydroxyl amine, not only the hydroxylamine substitution on the intended oxygen atom but also the hydroxylamine substitution on the carbonyl group is generally observed refer to Heterocyclic Compounds, Pyridine and its Derivatives , Vol. 14, Part 2, published by Interscience Publishers Ltd. . Under the circumstances, the present inventors have earnesly studied various relevant techniques and have found that the said compound may be obtained in a relatively high yield by carrying out the reaction in the presence of pyridine or the like compound. The compounds of the present invention are characterized by the existence of the 1,5 dihydroxy 4 pyridone 2 carboxamido group in the 7 positioned substituent therein and the present compounds have an unexpectedly intensified and higher bactericidal activity against various bacteria, especially against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, than the known 5 hydroxy 4 pyridone 2 carboxamido substituted derivatives, and further, the present compounds have higher solubility in water, which is an important matter for injections. The present invention provides the new cephalosporin derivatives and concretely illustrates hereinafter the preparation and the use of these derivatives. The object of the present invention is to provide new cephalosporin antibiotic derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which are free from the defects of other conventional cephalosporin antibiotics. Accordingly, the present invention provides new cephalosporin compounds as defined in claim 1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as well as bactericides containing the same as an active ingredient as defined in claim 17.
