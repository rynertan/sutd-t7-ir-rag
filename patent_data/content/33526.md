## Description
Lifting table The present invention relates to a lifting table of the type used for the feeding of panels of wood or the like to a machining line, where the panels are cut to the desired size. In the panel cutting plants, the panels are fed in stacks to a lifting table, which is cyclically lifted by predetermined amounts, so as to bring a predetermined number of stacked panels in correspondence with aorkpiece support surface of the machining line. At this point, there is promoted the intervention of a pusher bar which pushes the predetermined stack of panels onto the workpiece support surface. The cycle is then repeated, until the lifting table reaches with its supporting surface the said workpiece support surface, and the stack is completely exhausted The lifting table is then lowered to a loading position where again a new stack of panels is loaded thereon. The lifting table is usually formed with a roller runway surface, so that the panel stack which is fed from suitable feeding runways can be moved on the lifting table itself to a correct position with respect to the inlet of the machining line. Normally, in order to promote the shifting of the panel stack on the lifting table, some of the rollers of the said roller runaway are motorized. Usually, the lifting tables present a rectangular surface, and they are coupled to the inlet section of the machining line either with one of the longer sides or with one or the shorter sides, depending upon the size of the panels being machined, and or on the particular characteristic features of the machining line associated with the lifting table, and or the actual space availability of the place where the machining line is installed, at the interior of a factory. Therefore, if it is requested to modify the orientation of the rectangular lifting table of 900, it is necessary to have another lifting table, constructed precisely for this purpose. Moreover, presently the lifting tables are rather complicated in construction, particularly for what concerns the means for the motorization of some of their rollers, for the shifting of the panel stack on the table surface. The above and other inconveniences are obviated by the lifting table according to the present invention, which is characterized by the fact that the roller runway comprises a plurality of modular units, each presenting in plan view a square shape and accomodating at least two freely rotatable rollers arranged with their rotational axes parallel to each other the said modular units being insertable, into corresponding seats provided on the table, according to at least two positions which are angularly rotated of 900. Each modular unit consists of a square shaped rollercarrying frame which presents on its four sides four outwardly projecting side flanges, by means of which it bears onto horizontal, equispaced and parallel supporting bars. The supporting bars are mounted on a frame which constitutes the frame of the lifting table. Onto a fixed structure arranged below the lifting table there is mounted, in corrispondence of a hollow space obtained in the said table by removal of at least one roller carrying frame, a motorized shifting unit consisting of at least one shifting wheel and a motor for driving same into rotation. The shifting wheel has its rotational axis parallel to the rotational axes of the runway rollers and presents such a diameter that, in the lowered condition of the lifting table, it projects with a peripheral portion upwardly through the said hollow space of the table, until it reaches the runway surface defined by the rollers. The lifting table according to the invention is further characterized by that fact that it is vertically movable by means of a pair of rotatable vertical threaded shafts provided in correspondence of the ends of one side of its frame, and which are caused to rotate in synchronism, on said threaded shafts there being operatively mounted a pair of screw nuts connected to the table frame, while in correspondence of each one of the sides of the table frame, which are perpendicular to the side between the two vertical threaded shafts, there is arranged a suspension sprocket chain which is anchored by one end to a lower anchoring point next to the lowered position of the lifting table and by its other end it is anchored to an upper anchoring point next to the lifted position of the lifting table.The anchoring points of the said suspension chain are arranged at opposite sides of the table, and the said suspension chain is passed over a lateral sprocket wheel rotatably mounted on the table near to the side of the lower anchoring point, and is also passed under a lateral sprocket wheel rotatably mounted on the table near to the side of the upper anchoring point. The above features and advantages of the lifting table according to the invention will appear evident from the following detailed description of some preferred embodiments of same, made with reference to the attached drawings, in which Figure 1 shows the lifting table according to the invention, in side elevation and with parts in section Figure 2 it a top plan view, with parts in section, of the supporting frame of the lifting table Figure 3 is a diagrammatic perspective view of a modular unit forming the roller runway surface of the table Figure 4 is a section along line IV IV of Figure 3 Figure 5 is a diagrammatic perspective view of a motorized feeding unit adapted to be used with the lifting table according to the invention Figures 6 and 7 are diagrammatic top plan views illustrating to different possibilities of adaptation of the lifting table according to the invention. Figure 8 is a diagrammatic side section, along lineVIII VIII of Five 6, showing the table during the loading phase. Figure 9 is a diagrammatic top plan view of a modification of the lifting table according to the invention. With reference to Figure 1, letter A indicates the inlet section of a machining line and letter 9 indicates the workpiece support onto which there must be tr nsferred the panels or stacks of panels P which must be cut to size by cutting means such as saws, operating in the zone indicated by reference letter C. In proximity of the inlet section A of the machining line there is arranged the apparatus for the automatic loading of the panels, indicated by reference letter D. Onto the lifting table E, which presents a horizontal loading surface and is vertically movable, of the said automatic loading apparatus D, there must be cyclically loaded a stack of panels P.Reference letter F indicates the pusher bar which, after the lifting by a predetermined amount of the lifting table E, moves in the direction of the workpiece support B of the machining line and transfers a predetermined number of stacked panels P or even a single panel onto the said workpiece support 3. The panel supporting surface or upper surface of the lifting table E is constrected as a roller runway surface.With particular reference to Figure 2, the lifting table E co nists of a strong rectangular frame 1 which is subdivided by parallel and co planar supporting bars 2 equispaced between one another, into a suitable number of hollow spaces 3 presenting equal dimensions. Preferably, the length of the said hollow spaces 3 is a multiple of their width. With reference to Figures 3 and 4, the roller runway surface of the lifting table is formed by a plurality of modular units 4, each consisting of a square shaped rollercarrying frame of a size which can be inserted into the hollow space defined between the supporting bars 3, and presenting on its four sides four outwardly projecting side flanges 104. Just by way of example, the square shaped frames of the modular units 4 can be constructed by usingL shaped bars, as it can be appreciated from Figure 4. At the interior of the frame of the modular units 4 there are mounted freely rotatable the rollers 5, in a suitable number three in the illustrated example , with their rotational axes parallel to each other, and projecting with their cylindrical surface of a suitable and predetermined amount above the upper surface defined by the side flanges 104 of the said modular units 4. The modular units 4 are inserted in the hollow spaces of the frame 1 and bear with their side flanges 104 b the supporting bars 2 and on the frame sides. Of course, the width of the side flanges 104 and of the supporting bars 2 Ois calculated in such a manner as to avoid any superposition of the said side flanges 104 the one above the other, while guarateeing a precise fitting of the modular units 4 in the hollow spaces 3 of the frame 1.In this manner, there can be obtained, thanks to the square shape of the modular units 4, a roller runway surface with the rollers arranged either as shown in Figure 6 or in Figure 7, i.e. rotated of 900, depending upon the particular requirements of the machining line being served, as it clearly appears by looking at the above mentioned Figures 6 and 7, so that the runwaysV for feeding the panels P to the lifting table terminate either in correspondence of the larger side or of the smaller side of the said lifting friable. The modular units 4 can be secured to the frame 1 and supporting bars 2 by any suitable means. With particular reference to Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8, there is shown a shifting device for promoting the movement of the panels from the feeding runways V onto the lifting table E, and along the lifting table E itself. In correspondence of the side of the frame 1 of the lifting table E, through which the panels pass onto the said lifting table from the runways V, parts of the hollow space 3 are left free, i.e. unoccupied by the modular units 4, thus leaving an open square space corresponding precisely to the square shape of a modular unit. Below said open space, on the ground or on the base structure of the lifting table, there is secured a carrier frame 8 onto which there is mounted a motor and reduction unit 7, the shaft of the said reduction unit being parallel to the rotational axis of the rollers 5 of the lifting table, and carrying keyed at its opposite ends pair of wheels 6.The wheels 6 are of eoual diameter, and are preferably lined on their peripheral surface with any suitable friction material, such as rubber. Whenever the lifting table E is in its lowered condition, as shown in Figure 8, the wheels 6 are tangent to the runaway surface formed by the rollers 5 and are there fore capable of engaging the bottom of the stack of panels P coming from the feeding runways V. By driving into rotation the said wheels 6 through the motor unit 7, the stack of panels P can be easily moved along the surface of the lifting table E, to the desired position. The motorized shifting unit comprising the shifting wheels 6 and the motor and reduction unit 7, as above described, can be mounted also in correspondence of the terminal portions of the feeding runways V, as it clearly apt ears in Figures 6, 7 and 8. In the embodiment shown in Figure 8, the carrier frame 8 which carries the shifting wheels 6 and the motor and reduction unit 7 can be swingably mounted around a fulcrum axis 9 onto a fixed structure 10 secured to the ground or to the base structure of the lifting table, while elastic means, such as pressure stings 11, can be provided to elastically urge upwardly the carrier frame 8 and consequently the shifting wheels 6, so as to ensure a greater adherence of the said wheels against the bottom of the panel stack to be shifted. With reference to Figure 9, it is to be noted that, in order to increase the surface of the lifting table, to the frame 1 of the said lifting table there can be attached in an overhanging manner and removably, small additional frames 1 which are also adapted to receive the nodular units 4. With particular reference to Figures 1 and 2, there is shown a constructive improvement relating to the mezris for the support and the vertical movement of the lifting table E. In correspondence of the four corner zones of the frame 1 of the table there are arranged four upright columns 12 13 which are connected by means of bottom tr. verse bars 14. At the interior of the two upright columns 12, which are the ones adjacent to the inlet section A of the machining line, there are mounted rotatable around their longituinal axis the threaded shafts 15, connected to each other for rotation and which can be rotated by means of a motor and reductor unit 16 centrally arranged. The threaded shafts 15 are operatively connected with screw nuts 17 which are integral to the corner zones of the frame 1 next to the upright columns 12. On the sides of the frame 1 between the uprights 12 13 and in correspondence of the ends of the said sides, there are mounted freely rotatable the sprocket wheels 18, 19. At the top end of each upright column 13 there is anchored the end of a sprocket chain 20, which is passed under the sprocket wheel 19 and over the sprocket wheel 18 and it is finally anchored by its other end to the bottom of the opposed upright column 12.By looking at Figure 1, it appears evident that to a lifting or lowering movement of the table E, promoted by the symultaneous rotation of the i nrezded shafts 15 cooperating with the screw nuts 17, there corresponds respectively a lengthening of the section 120 of the chain between the sprocket wheel 18 and the lower anchoring point of the chain, and also there corresponds respectively an equal and contrary shortening and lengtheninvg of the opposed section 220 of the chain between the sprocket wheel 19 and the upper anchoring point of the chain. The lifting table E is therefore well supported and it can be moved vertically under the action of just two threaded shaft and screw nut assemblies. It is believed that the invention will have been clearly understood from the foregoing detailed description of the preferred embodiments. Changes in the details of construction may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention, as above described and claimed hereinafter.
