Formula C complexes, wherein X1 is bromo, are prepared by reacting the appropriate ligand of Formula B with bromoauric acid hydrate which is commercially available, for example, from Strem Chemicals, Inc., Newburyport,Massachusetts which has been reduced by treatment with thioidiglycol, or by reacting the appropriate ligand ofFormula B directly with bromoauric acid hydrate in an appropriate non reactive organic solvent. Alternatively,Formula C complexes, wherein X1 is bromo, are prepared by reacting the appropriate compound of Formula C , wherein X1 is chloro, with sodium bromide in an appropriate organic solvent, such as aqueous ethanol or DMF. Formula III compounds, wherein X1 is bromo, are prepared by reacting one mole of the appropriate compound of Formula C , wherein X1 is bromo, with one mole of the appropriate compound of Formula B . Alternatively,Formula III compounds, wherein X1 is bromo, are prepared by reacting the appropriate Formula III compound, wherein X1 is chloro, with sodium bromide in an appropriate organic solvent, such as aqueous ethanol or DMF. Formula III compounds, wherein X1is iodo, are prepared by reacting the appropriate Formula III compound, wherein X1 is chloro or bromo, with sodium iodide in an appropriate organic solvent, such as acetone. The compounds of Formula I and III have tumor cell growth inhibiting activity which has been demonstrated in at least one animal tumor model. P388 lymphocytic leukemia is currently the most widely used animal tumor model for screening for antitumor agents and for detailed evaluation of active compounds. This tumor system is widely accepted as an antitumor agent screening tool because it is sensitive to virtually all of the clinically active antineoplastic agents quantitative and reproducible amenable for large scale screening and predictive for activity in other animal tumor models. Drugs that are highly active in intraperitoneal ip P388 leukemia are generally active in other tumor models as well. The anti tumor activity of the compounds of Formula I and III is demonstrated in the P388 leukemia mouse model employing the following protocol 106 P388 leukemia cells are inoculated ip in B6D2F1 mice.Twenty four hours later, if the tumor inoculum proves to be free of bacterial contamination as determined by 24 hours incu bation in thioglycollate broth , animals are randomized into groups of 6 and housed in shoebox cages. The compound to be evaluated is dissolved in saline if soluble therein or in a minimal volume of either N,N dimethyl acetamide DMA or 95 ethanol depending upon solubility . An equal volume of saline is added to those compounds dissolved in an organic vehicle if the drug comes out of solution an equal volume of polyethoxylated castor oil is added and then saline qs to a concentration such that the desired dose is delivered in 0.5 ml. The final concentration of DMA, ethanol and or polyethoxylated castor oil is 10 percent. Dilutions for lower doses are made with saline so there is a decreasing proportion of organic solvents in the vehicle with decreasing dosage. These vehicles provide soluble formulations or suspensions . Formulations are prepared immediately prior to injection. The compound is administered ip on Days 1 through 5 i.e. treatment is initiated 24 hrs after tumor inoculation . Each experiment includes three groups of 6 animals as untreated controls and animals treated with a positive control, cisplatin, at two dose levels. Animals are weighed as a group on Days 1, 5 and 9, and average weight change L wt. is used as a reflection of toxicity. Each experiment also includes an inoculum titration groups of 8 mice inoculated ip with 105 two 100 P388 leukemia cells. The titration is used to calcu late cell kill achieved by treatment with drugs. Animals are monitored daily for mortality and experiments are terminated after 45 days. The endpoint is median survival time MST and in crease in lifespan ILS which is the percentage of increase in MST relative to untreated controls. Untreated controls inoculated ip with 106 P388 leukemia cells generally survive for a median of 9 to 11 days. A drug is considered active if it produces 25 percent ILS.

It should be noted that the 4 pyridyl analog of Compound No. 10 ofTable B was also tested twice in the ip P388 leukemia assay, but exhibited insignificant anti tumor activity i.e. 25 in both tests. The cytotoxic activity of two Formula III compounds was evaluated in vivo using B16 melanoma cells. In this system, groups of eight B6D2F1 mice are inoculated ip with 0.5 ml of a 10 w v brei of B16 melanoma prepared from pooled sc tumors excised at 14 21 days fromC57B1 6 donor mice. Daily treatment is begun 24 hours after tumor implantation and is continued daily for ten 10 days. The route of drug administration is ip. The mice are monitored daily for survival for sixty 60 days.Anti tumor activity is assessed by prolongation of median survival time. An ILS of 25 indicates activity in this tumor model.

Compositions according to the invention for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, suspensions or emulsions. The composition may be in the form of a solution of the active ingredient in a minimal volume of dimethylacetamide or ethanol, for example, 5 v v, brought up to volume with peanut oil or normal saline solution. Polyethoxylated castor oil, for example, 2 to 5 v v, may also be used to solubilize the active ingredient. In addition, the composition may be in the form of a slurry with, for example, hydroxypropyl cellulose or other suitable suspending agent. As an emulsifying agent, lecithin, for example, may be used. The composition may also be provided in the form of a sterile solid which can be dissolved in a sterile injectable medium immediately before use. Freireich et al., Cancer Chemo. Rept., 50, 219 244 1966 , compared the quantitative toxicity of 18 anticancer drugs in six species after correcting the data to a uniform schedule of treatment for five consecutive days.This analysis demonstrated that mouse, rat, dog, human, monkey and man have essentially the same maximum tolerated dose MTD when compared on a basis of mg m2 of body surface area. The study suggested that Phase I clinical trials could be safely initiated at a dose one third the animal MTD. The mouse was as useful as any other species in this regard on which to base the calculation. The appropriate therapeutically effective dose for any compound of the invention can therefore be determined readily by those skilled in the art from simple experimentation with laboratory animals, preferably mice. It will be appreciated that the actual preferred dosages of the compounds of Formula I or Formula III used in the compositions of this invention will vary according to the particular compound being used, the particular composition formulated, the mode of administration, and the particular site, host and disease being treated.The route of internal administration should be selected to ensure that an effective tumor cell growth inhibiting amount of the compound of Formula I or Formula III contacts the tumor. Optimal dosages for a given set of conditions can be ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional dosage determination tests in view of the above experimental data. For parenteral administration of a compound of Formula III or a goldcontaining compound of Formula I the dose generally employed is from about 5 to about 100 mg m2 of body surface per day for one to five days, repeated about every fourth week for four courses of treatment. For parenteral administration of a non gold containing compound ofFormula I the dose preferably employed is from about 15 to about 600 mg m2 of body surface per day for five days, repeated about every fourth week for four courses of treatment. The method for inhibiting the growth of animal tumor cells sensitive to a compound of Formula I orFormula III in accordance with this invention comprises administering to a host animal afflicted with said tumor cells, an effective tumor cell growth inhibiting amount of a compound of Formula I or Formula III .
