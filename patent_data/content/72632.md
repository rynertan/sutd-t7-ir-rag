# Re enterable service wire splice closure.

## Abstract
Re enterable service wire splice closure having a shal low cup containing a sealant into which is placed an inverted cylindrical shallow tray containing the spliced ends of the service wire, the cup and the tray have aligned slots through which the cable may extend and a screw cap drives the tray into the cup forcing the sealant around the wire splice connectors to encapsulate the same for moisture resistance. A connector element in the tray serves as the strain relief element for the service wire and as the connector element for the grounding shield.
