# Low pass digital averaging filter and method of recovering a low frequency component of a composite analog waveform.

## Abstract
A circuit which uses a digital averaging technique to filter a composite analog signal is disclosed. An analog to digital converter 2 receives a composite analog signal and provides a digital output signal which is received by an addersubstrac tor circuit 18 and by a sample register 12 which stores the digital output signal for a predetermined number of sample periods before providing the stored signal to the adder sub tractor. A storage register 20 stores a running average equal to the sum of the digital signals received during the most recent predetermined number of sample periods, and the running average is fed back to the adder subtractor. During each sample period, the adder subtractor adds the current digital output signal to the running average and subtracts the delayed signal output by the sample register. The result is stored in the storage register as a new running average.
