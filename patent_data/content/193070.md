# Combined nozzle with air foil.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a combined nozzle and air foil for use with a cutter blade. Specifically, the combined nozzle and air foil of the present invention is used with a cutter blade such as a saw or grinding wheel for cutting hard substrate material such as ceramic or semi conductor material. The partial vacuum thereby provides for an efficient water flow to the surface of the blade and to the substrate.
