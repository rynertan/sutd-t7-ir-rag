## Abstract
A fountain, suitable in particular for use in domestic locations, comprises a generally vertical fluid inlet tube 1, 20, 40, 63 , a spray tube 3, 22, 44, 62 surrounding the fluid inlet tube and free to move nearly in the direction of the length of the latter, the spray tube being open at its lower end and having at least one flow restricting orifice 9, 16, 17, 23, 25, 46, 47, 48, 65 at its upper end, and a liquid container 4, 21, 43 surrounding the spray tube. A pump 28 may be provided to feed fluid, e.g. air or water, to the fluid inlet tube. Liquid ejected from the orifice or orifices may be collected in a catchment vessel 10, 51, 64 and returned to the liquid container for recycling.
