# Control system for variable displacement motors.

## Abstract
A hydraulic motor control system comprises a speed con trol loop 76, 92, 62, 68 and a pressure control loop 74, 92, 58 which provide closed loop control of a variable displacement chamber space and the mechanical advantage coupling thereof to the motor output shaft. The speed control loop is effective in the speed control mode of operation to maintain a set speed within a given load range. In response to load increases beyond said range, the pressure control loop pre empts the speed control loop so that the control operates to maintain a predetermined load.
