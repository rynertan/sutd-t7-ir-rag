# Integrated CT scanner gantry.

## Abstract
An integrated computer tomography scanner gentry assembly is provided wherein an open bore rotor is supported by a bearing assembly on an open bore stator. An x ray assembly is mounted on the rotor and supplied with high voltage power during continuous rotation about the stator through use of a slip ring assembly which is mounted bet ween the rotor and stator. The inside surface of the stator which faces a patient generally lies along the surface of a truncated cone to permit substantial tilting of the stator. The stator and rotor both have a stepped cylindrical formation forming two isolated annular recesses therebetween, one of the recesses housing the cathode of the slip ring and the other of the recesses housing the anode of the slip ring. The reces ses can be filled with a high voltage insulating fluid and can be readily sealed to prevent leakage of said fluid. An x ray assembly bracket is removably attachable to the rotor to sup port both an x ray source and x ray optics in order to permit the x ray source and x ray optics to be assembled and aligned on the bracket at a location remote from the rotor and stator. The overlapping positions of the stepped cylinders relative to the x ray source and optics assembly bracket reduces the cross sectional area and overall gantry volume thereby pro viding confortable patient access for whole body CT scanning.
