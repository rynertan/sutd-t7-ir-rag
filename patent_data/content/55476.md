# Degradation of halogenated carbon compounds.

## Abstract
Halogenated carbon compounds containing at least three halogen atoms and capable of undergoing bimolecular nucleophilic substitution are degraded by reaction in an aprotic solvent with a strong nucleophile selected from superoxide ion and hydroxide ion. The process is particularly applicable to compounds in which at least three halogen atoms are covalently joined to a tetrahedral carbon atom. In a specific embodiment, superoxide ion is electrolytically generated in an aprotic solvent containing a soluble organic electrolyte. In a further embodiment, the aprotic solvent is dimethyl sulfoxide, which, when converting carbon tetraha lide, forms dimethylsulfone and carbonate.
