# Repairing degraded tubes of steam generators.

## Abstract
A sealable multimetallic sleeve 10 is used for rapidly repairing a tube 22 degraded by a detrimental chemical at tack on the outside surface of the tube 22 within and in a vi cinity of a tube sheet in a steam generator. The sleeve 10 is sealably inserted into the degraded tube 22 , spanning the region of the degradation. The sleeve 10 includes an inner member 12 with equivalent mechanical properties of the degraded tube 22 and an outer member 14 metallur gically bonded to the inner member 12 and resistive to caustic intergranular chemical attack causing tube degra dation. The sleeve 10 has an expanded portion 17 at one end for positioning in the tube 22 within the tube sheet, and a multiplicity of grooves 16 in and adjacent to the other end of the sleeve 10 and containing brazing material.
