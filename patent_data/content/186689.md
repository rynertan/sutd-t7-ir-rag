## Description
The invention relates to an optical information carrier comprising an optically transparent layer and a reflective layer adjacent to each other, wherein the interface therebetween comprises an optically readable information structure containing alternate areas with such different properties that a scanning light beam is modulated in correspondence with the information present in said structure. An optical information carrier of this type is for instance described in patent abstracts of Japan, volume 7, no. 188 P 217 1333 , August 17, 1983. Information carriers of this type in a broad sense of the meaning are known for various purposes and in various embodiments. Specimens are for instance optical lattice grids, holograms and audio discs or video discs compact discs . A general problem with these known optical structures is the fact that in general gases and vapours, especially water vapour, are able to diffuse into the optical transparent layer but not through the reflective layer. Dependent onto the environmental conditions, especially during a reduction of the atmospheric pressure and or the water vapour concentration water vapour and or other gases will diffuse to the outside. At that side of the optical transparant layer directed to the atmospheric there are no obstructions for such a diffusion. At the side, where the reflective layer is realized, said diffusion, however, causes problems. The reflective layer in most cases consists of metal which is not transmissible for gases and vapours. In case the vapour pressure at the interface between the optical transparant layer and the reflective layer under the influence of environmental conditions increases, then it is not inconceivable that the adherence between both layers is locally not able to withstand this increase in pressure and will collaps. The result thereof is the development of larger or smaller bubbles or blisters at the interface between both layers. Said blisters are forming a serious hindrance for the error free reading of the information present in the structure. Taking into account the sometimes very small dimensions of the information structure, the dimensions on a video disc are in the order of some µm, the development of even the smallest gas or vapour bubbles in said interface has to be prevented. The presence of a diffusion tight reflective layer can also result into a distortion of the information carrier as a whole, because the vapour profile of a layer will in general be symmetrical in the direction towards the side edges, assuming that the same atmospheric pressure prevails at the both sides and that a free exit respectively a free penetration of gas and vapour is possible. However, if one side of the layer is closed in a vapour tight and gas tight way, such as with the optical information carrier of the above mentioned type, then in general an asymmetrical damp profile will be developed in the optical information carrier. Said asymmetrical vapour profile causes mechanical tensions in the carrier which may result into a mechanical distortion of the carrier as a whole, which phenomenon could be indicated by the warping . With an optical information carrier as for instance a compact disc this warping phenomenon will soon lead to a situation in which the information read out apparatus is not able any more to read the stored information. The object of the invention is now to embody the above indicated optical information carrier such, that regardless changes into the environmental conditions the forming of blisters and the development of mechanical tensions, distortions, etc. is prevented. In agreement with said object the optical information carrier of the above mentioned type is now characterized in that between the surface of the transparent layer and the adjacent surface of the reflective layer multiple gas filled buffer spaces are provided at positions distributed over the interface between said layers, said buffer spaces being mutually connected so as to provide pressure and vapor equalization between the spaces, gas filled buffer spaces and connections are not forming one single continuous tracking groove. The attention is drawn to an optical information carrier as described in the mentioned patent abstracts of Japan, volume 7, no. 188 P 217 1333 , August 17, 1983. This prior art information carrier comprises an optical recording thin film laminated to a first substrate and covered by a second substrate containing tracking grooves. The gap areas formed by the grooves 4 are set at the atmospheric pressure or less. The information is recorded into the optical recording thin film at the gap areas of the grooves 4. No provisions are made for any interconnection between the various grooves. The grooves are only used as tracking aids. The effect of the distributed buffer spaces in the interface between both layers is that also at the side of the reflective layer vapour or damp can diffuse out of the optically transparent layer into said buffer spaces so that the vapour pressure at the interface between the optically transparent layer and the reflective layer is not or hardly increased. The forming of bubbles or blisters at the interface between both layers is therewith effectively prevented. Furthermore the buffer spaces are preferably created such that the vapour profile through the whole optically transparent layer as result of the presence of the buffer spaces remains symmetrical or at least to a large extent symmetrical, such that also the creation of mechanical tensions, which could lead to warping of the whole structure, is prevented. The buffer spaces are created by making cavities or excavations either in the reflective layer or in the optically transparent layer. Preferably the buffer spaces are formed by multiple cavities made in the optical transparent layer adjacent to the reflective layer. Preferably furthermore the shape, dimensions or embodiments of the buffer spaces are selected such that said spaces can be distinguished optically during the read out of the optical information carrier. In case for instance with a circular information carrier the buffer spaces are directed radially in relation to the information structure of the carrier, optically recognizable buffer spaces can be used to divide the carrier into sectors comprising different information. In another embodiment the buffer spaces are created between the informations tracks on the carrier in a spiral shape or circular shape. In these cases the buffer space can be used to control the reading light beam in relation to the information carrier along the information tracks. Said examples indicate that the buffer spaces can form part of the optical information on the carrier. In another example the information carrying structure comprises optically recognizable piles onto a flat transparent substrate. In that case the space between the piles can form part of the buffer space or may form said buffer space itself. It is clearly illustrated in these examples that the buffer spaces must be connected mutually. It has appeared that the buffer spaces have to be connected mutually such that the pressure equalization at the interface between the optical transparent layer and the reflective layer is at a maximum. A preferred embodiments of the optical information carrier are disclosed in the dependent claims. Further preferred embodiments, details and further advantages of the invention will be discussed in the following description with reference to embodiments illustrated in the attached drawings. Figure 1 illustrates a cross section through a part of an optical information carrying structure according to the invention. Figure 2 illustrates a cross section through a part of another embodiment of an optical information carrier according to the invention along the edge of said carrier. Figure 3 illustrates a cross section near the edge of an audio disc or video disc comprising a buffer zone according to the invention. The optical information carrier 1 in Figure 1 is assembled from an optically transparent layer 2 which, in the Figure at the under side, comprises an optically readable information structure comprising a number of information tracks 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d. In a further not in detail indicated way each track comprises alternative areas with such different properties that a scanning light beam will be modulated in correspondence with the information present in the structure. From the prior art various ways are known to embody such optically readable information tracks and to realize said tracks into practice. The optically transparent layer 2 is closed at the under side by the reflective layer 3, for instance embodied as a metal layer which is polished at least at one side. Between the information tracks 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d buffer spaces 4 are present, realized by means of cavities or grooves made in the optically transparent layer 2. Dependent onto the built up of the information structure passages have to be present through the information tracks 7a,7b, by means of which passages the cavities are mutually communicating. The optically transparent layer 2 is in general made of a plastic material in which water vapour or gas can diffuse. The reflective layer 3 is in general made of a metal in which no water vapour or gas can diffuse. In case the cavities 4 are omitted, then the transparent layer 2 would be closed gas tight and water tight at one side by the reflective layer 3 with the result that at said under side no gas or water vapour can diffuse out of the transparent layer 2. Dependent onto the environmental conditions the result thereof will be a relatively high vapour pressure or gas pressure at the interface between the layers 2 and 3 which might cause a local separation between both layers and the forming of so called blisters, small gas or vapour bubbles. As will be clear the reading of the information tracks will be seriously disturbed by such blisters or even made impossible. Thanks to the presence of the cavities 4 water vapour or gas may diffuse out of the transparent layer 2 at the under side. Said gas or water vapour reaches the hollow spaces 4, but the thereby created pressure increase is almost neglectable and will certainly not lead to the forming of blisters. Figure 2 illustrates a further embodiment of the information carrier 11 according to the invention comprising an optically transparent layer 12 and a reflective layer 13. The layer 12 carries also in this case the schematically indicated information tracks 17a, 17b, ...., each comprising alternating areas. The buffer spaces are in this case formed by means of grooves 14 into the reflective layer 13. Along the edge of the carrier in Figure 2 a relatively deep excavation 15 is realized into the reflective layer 13, which excavation is through transversal grooves in a not illustrated way communicating with the ends of a spirally formed groove 14 embodying the buffer space. Because of said deep excavation 15 the volume of the buffer zone as a whole, comprising the mutually communicating spaces 14, is significantly increased and the function of said buffer zone is enhanced thereby. In this embodiment furthermore a ring 16 is installed along the edge of the disc, which ring 16 forms a connection between the transparent layer 12 and the reflective metal layer 13. Said ring is preferably made of a plastic, such as poly methyl methacrylate, poly vinyl alcohol, cellophane or cellulose acetate, or is made of a foamed plastic such as poly urethane, poly vinyl chloride, or poly methyl methacrylate. In all cases a direct connection or a diffusion connection with the atmosphere is created such that an even more optimal funtioning of the buffer zone created by the spaces 15 and 14 will be guaranteed. Instead thereof or as an addition passages can be made through said ring 16 to assure a pressure equalization between the buffer zone and the atmosphere. The result of a direct connection or a diffusion connection with the atmosphere is furthermore that the vapour pressure, especially the water vapour pressure, at both sides of the transparent layer will be equal or almost equal. We have found that the diffusion of water vapour through the mutually communicating buffer zones is taking place so fast, that the vapour pressure in the whole buffer space is almost equal to the vapour pressure in the atmosphere. The development of an asymmetrical vapour pressure profile with the thereout resulting mechanical tensions, which easily could lead to warping of the whole information carrier making said information carrier useless, is therewith prevented. Finally Figure 3 illustrates a cross section through an embodiment of an audio or video disc similar to the embodiment in Figure 1, which disc comprises a relatively deep excavation. The structure 21 illustrated in Figure 3 comprises an optically transparent layer 22, the underside of which carries the information tracks 27a, 27b, 27c. Between said tracks the buffer zones 24 are created by forming grooves in the transparent layer 22 between the tracks. The tracks 27a, 27b, 27c may consist out of series of piles in the same way as is illustrated in Figure 2, but can also be realized in another known way. Along the edge of the information structure in the embodiment in Figure 3 a relatively deep excavation 25 is realized in the optically transparent layer 22 communicating with the mutually interconnected spaces 24. The deep excavation 25 results into a significant volume increase of the total buffer zone comprising of the mutually interconnected spaces 24 and therewith in an enhanced functioning of said buffer zone. Furthermore also in this embodiment a ring 26 is installed along the edge of the carrier, which ring 26 forms a connection between the carrier 22 and the reflective metal layer 23. Preferably again said ring is made of a plastic such as poly methyl methacrylate, poly vinyl alcohol, cellophane or cellulose acetate, or is made of a foamed plastic such as poly urethane, poly vinyl chloride or poly methyl metacrylate. In all cases a direct communication connection or a diffusion connection with the atmosphere is created such that the optimum functioning of the buffer zone comprising the spaces 25 and 24 is guaranteed. Instead of or as an addition the ring 26 may comprise passages to guarantee a pressure equalization between te buffer zone and the atmosphere. With reference to the forming of blisters the invention proves its advantages with all materials in which gas or vapour can diffuse. In relation to the warping effect the invention has special advantages with carriers of plexi glass poly methyl methacrylate and, although to a lesser extent, carriers of poly carbonate.
