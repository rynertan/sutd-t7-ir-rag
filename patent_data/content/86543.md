# Crystalline silicate catalysts with deactivated external surface, and process for its deactivation.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method for selectively deactivating cat alytically active sites which occur only on the surface of a zeolite of boralite catalyst. Active sites occurring on the interior of the pores are masked by saturating the catalyst with an organic compound which fills substantially the whole of the catalyst pore volume. The catalyst so treated is then exposed to a deactivating agent, such as a solution of an alkali metal salt which is substantially immiscible with, substantially insoluble in, and which is otherwise unreactive to said pore filling compound. The catalyst is then treated to drive off the pore filling compound, yielding a catalyst se lectively deactivated only on the external surface, but which is not deactivated within the pores. The treatment enables the catalyst to be used for e.g. hydrocarbon conversion for long time periods without carbon buildups around the pore entrances, which buildup would otherwise either restrict entry into the pores by reactants or exit therefrom by product.
