## Description
This invention relates to Shikimate kinase hereinafter abbreviated as SK is an enzyme that catalyzes conversion of shikimic acid to shikimic acid 3 phosphate. Shikimic acid 3 phosphate thus formed is in turn converted, via chorismic acid, to phenylalanine, tyrosine or tryptophan. Some examples are mentioned in the scientific literature in which recombinant DNA techniques are used for constructing aromatic amino acids producing bacteria FR A 2 486 961, JP A 59 156 292, Japanese Patent Applications Laid open No. 208,994 1982 , No. 71,397 1982 , No. 89,194 1983 and No. 134,994 1983 . Among these, JA A 59 156 292 discloses a Corynebacterium host strain which is transformed by using recombinant DNA comprising a gene which takes part in tryptophan synthesis, and a process to produce and to culture these bacteria, thus providing a method to accumulate large amounts of tryptophan. Accordingly, FR A 2 486 961 provides a method for producing phenylalanine in high yield by transforming a mutant E. coli strain with plasmids carrying genes, which are involved in the biosynthetic pathway of this amino acid. However, none of these references is concerned with a gene that codes for SK hereinafter referred to as SK gene . Hence, no microorganisms are available having the capacity to produce one or more aromatic amino acids with high yields. It is an object of this invention to obtain micro organisms with higher productivity for aromatic amino acids, and to establish a process for producing aromatic amino acids with higher efficiency, than was previously possible. This and other objects of the invention as will hereinafter more readily be apparent have been accomplished by providing a recombinant DNA molecule comprising a DNA gene coding for shikimate kinase, obtainable from Brevibacterium lactofermentum, deposited under FERM BP 888 and 889, as a Pst I fragment of 2.9kb, and operatively connected to a DNA segment capable of acting as a plasmid vector, wherein said recombinant DNA molecule is capable of replicating in a Coryneform bacterium and of expressing the shikimate kinase gene. A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing, wherein The inventors have succeeded in isolating The Typical examples of wild strains of Besides these wild strains capable of producing glutamic acid, the The SK gene may be isolated by the procedure described below or by other known techniques of genetic engineering, now that this gene has been identified. Chromosomal DNA is extracted from a strain of A wide variety of restriction enzymes may be used for cleaving the chromosomal gene if conditions of the cleavage reaction are properly controlled. Any plasmid vectors that can replicate in the cells of The cleavage of plasmid vector DNA is achieved by using a restriction enzyme which cleaves the DNA only at one site, or by partial digestion with a restriction enzyme capable of cleaving the DNA at several sites. After the vector DNA and chromosomal DNA are cleaved with the same restriction enzyme, or after otherwise cleaved fragments of vector and chromosomal DNAs are modified with complementary oligonucleotides at both ends, the two fragments are subjected to ligation. The two fragments are said to be operatively connected when the resulting recombinant DNA molecule is capable of expressing the SK gene and can reproduce in a host The recombinant DNA composed of the chromosomal DNA and vector plasmid DNA fragments thus obtained is then introduced to a As for the protoplast method, the above mentioned technique employed for The aromatic amino acid producing bacteria of this invention are generally obtained by transformation using SK deficient strains as a host cell. Strains of high productivity for aromatic amino acids are often derived when the following host cells are selected. A mutant of A mutant strain of A mutant strain of Higher productivity for aromatic amino acids is often observed when other genes are amplified in addition to the SK gene. These include genes that code for 3 dehydroquinate synthase and shikimate dehydrogenase as used in the Example described later, genes that code for 3 deoxy D arabino heptulosonate 7 phosphate DAHP , a synthetase gene for 5 dehydroquinate dehydratase, a gene for 3 enolpyruvylshikimate 5 phosphate synthetase, and a gene for chorismate synthetase. When production of tryptophan is intended, better results are often obtained by further amplifying a gene for anthranilate synthase, a gene for anthranilate phosphoribosyl transferase, a gene for N 5 phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase, a gene for indole 3 glycerol phosphate synthase or a gene for tryptophan synthase. For production of phenylalanine or tyrosine, on the other hand, it is preferable that the transformed strains also contain an amplified gene for prephenate dehydrogenase, prephenate transaminase, pretyrosine dehydrogenase or tyrosine aminotransferase. The The collected cells were lysed with lysozyme SDS, and the chromosomal DNA was extracted with phenol and purfied in the usual way, giving 3.5 mg of purified DNA. pAJ1844 M.W. 5.4 Md was selected as a suitable vector, and its DNA was isolated as follows Chromosomal DNA obtained in 1 above .10 µg and plasmid DNA obtained in 2 above 5 µg were separately cleaved with restriction endonuclease Pst I at 37 C for one hour. After heat treatment at 65 C for ten minutes, the two reaction mixtures were mixed together, and the ligation reacion was carried out at 10 C for 24 hours with DNA ligase derived from T phage in the presence of ATP and dithiothreitol. After heat treatment at 65 C for 5 minutes, ethanol twice as much by volume was added, and the precipitate of ligated DNA was collected. The protoplast method was employed for transformation. After incubation at 30 C for two weeks, about 25,000 colonies resistant to chloramphenicol appeared, which were transferred by replica plating technique to a minimal medium 2 glucose, 1 ammonium sulfate, 0.3 urea, 0.1 KH₂PO₄, 0.04 MgSO₄.7H₂O, 2 ppm iron ions, 2 ppm manganese ions, 200 µg 1 thiamin hydrochloride, 50 µg l biotin, 10 µg l chloramphenicol, and 1.8 agar pH 7.0 . Thus, five strains which are resistant to chloramphenicol and have lost the property of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan auxotrophy were obtained. Each of the five strains was lysed and the lysate solution was analyzed by electrophoresis on agarose gel in a similar manner to that described in 2 above. As a result of detection of plasmid DNA, a plasmid larger than pAJ 1844 the vector plasmid was detected in all of the strains tested. When the five types of plasmids thus obtained were cleaved with Pst I the restriction endonuclease used for the DNA recombination , there was observed a DNA fragment 2.9Kb in size common to all of the five types. This suggests that the SK gene resides in the Pst I DNA fragment 2.9Kb . The recombinant plasmid with the 2.9Kb DNA fragment inserted into the Pst I cleavage point of vector pAJ1844 was termed pAJ927 the recombinant plasmid also having, other than the 2.9Kb DNA fragment, Pst I DNA fragments 1.15 and 4.3 Kb in size was termed pAJ1219 the strain carrying pAJ927 was termed AJ12158, FERM P7865, FERM BP888 and the strain carrying pAJ1219 was termed AJ12159 FERM P7866, FERM BP 889 . The mutants identified above by FERM P numbers were originally deposited on September 22, 1984, and April 6, 1983, at the Fermentation Research Institute, Agency of Industrial Sciences and Technology, Ministry of International Trade and Industry FRI , 1 3, Migashi l Chome, Yatebe machi, Tsukuba gun, Ibaragi ken 305, Japan, and were accorded the FERM P numbers indicated above. The mutants deposits were then converted into deposits under the Budapest Treaty on September 22, 1985, and were accorded the corresponding FERM BP numbers. To prove the presence of SK gene on the 2.9Kb DNA fragment detected in 5 above, Of the chloramphenical resistant colonies, ten colonies were picked up and tested for phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan auxotrophy. It was found that each colony tested has lost this auxotrophic property, clearly indicating the presence of SK gene on the above mentioned recombinant plasmids. The transformed strain being tested was cultured in 20 ml of a standard medium for tryptophan production 130 g l glucose, 25 g l NH₄ ₂SO₄, 1 g l KH₂PO₄, 1 g l MgSO₄.7H₂O, 12 g l fumaric acid, 3 ml l acetic acid, 50 ml l Mi eki hydrolyzate of soy protein , 10 mg l MnSO₄.4H₂O, 50 µg l biotin, 2000 µg l Thiamin hydrochloride and 50 g l CaCO₃ pH 6.5 at 30 C for 22 hours. The thus grown cells were lysed by untrasonic treatment, the resulting mixture was centrifuged 32000 x g, 20 minutes , and the supernatant crude enzyme solution was allowed to react, at 30 C for 30 minutes, with a solution containing 50mM veronal buffer pH 9.0 , 1mM shikimic acid, 4mM ATP, 5mM MgCl₂ and 10mM NaF. When reaction was complete, 0.2 ml of lM Tris HCl buffer pH 7.8 was added, and the mixture was heated at 100 C for two minutes to inactivate the enzyme. After cooling, 3.0 ml of solution appropriately diluted to a shikimic acid content of 2 to 10 µg was taken, 0.5 mol of 1 periodic acid solution was added, and the mixture allowed to stand at room temperature for three hours. The amount of shikimic acid was determined by adding 0.5 ml of lN NaOH aq. and 0.3 ml of 0.1M glycine solution and measuring absorbance at 380 nm. SK activity was calculated from the difference in the amount of shikimic acid before and after reaction. The result is summarized in Table 1. Plasmids pAJ927 and pAJ1219 were introduced into shikimate dehydrogenase deficient strain AB2834 and 3 dehydroquinate synthase deficient strain AB2847 both derived from Transformation was effected by treatment of recipient cells with calcium chloride. Of the chloramphenicol resistant colonies, ten colonies were picked up and tested for the property of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan auxotrophy. It was found that both pAJ927 and pAJ1219 caused AB2847 to lose the auxotropic property. With AB2834, on the other hand, no such change was observed after transformation with pAJ927, but the auxotropic property was lost after transformation with pAJ1219. This indicates that pAJ927 carries cloned SK gene and 3 dehydroquinate synthase gene on the inserted Pst I DNA fragment 2.9Kb and that pAJ1219 has cloned SK gene, 3 dehydrequinate synthase gene, and shikimate dehydrogenase gene. Crude enzyme solutions were prepared from AJ12036 wild strain and AJ12159 transformed strain by the method used in 7 above. Each of these crude enzyme solutions was added to a mixture of 0.1M Tris HCl buffer pH 7.4 , 0.8mM NADP and 4mM shikimic acid, and shikimate dehydrogenase activity was determined by measuring the change in optical density at 300 m µ resulting from the conversion of NADH. Plasmid pAJ927 was completely cleaved with restriction enzyme Bgl II. After the solution was heated at 65 C for ten minutes, ATP, dithiothreitol, and DNA ligase derived from T4 phage were added, and the ligation reaction was carried out at 10 C for 16 hours. After this solution was heated at 65 C for ten minutes, ethanol twice as much by volume was added, and the precipitate of ligated DNA was collected. This was suspended in TEN buffer and cleaved with restriction enzyme BamH I. After this solution was heated at 65 C for ten minutes, ethanol twice as much by volume was added, and the precipitate of DNA which separated out was collected and dissolved in TEN buffer to be used for transformation. AJ12157 was again transformed by pAJ912, and chloramphenicol resistant colonies were picked up. It was demonstrated that all of these had lost the property of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan auxotrophy. This indicates the presence of the SK gene on pAJ912. Plasmid pAJ912 was then used to transform AB2847, a mutant of Each strain was inoculated to 20 ml of a standard medium for tryptophan production 130 g l of glucose, 25 g l NH₄ ₂SO₄ 12 g l fumaric acid, 3 ml l acetic acid, 1 g l KH₂PO₄, 10 mg l MnSO₄.7H₂O, 50 g l d biotin, 200 µg l thiamin hydrochloride, 400 mg l methionine, 650 mg l tyrosine, 50 ml l Mi eki hydrolyzate of soy protein and 50 g l CaCO₃ pH 6.5 . Cultivation with shaking was continued at 30 C for 72 hours, and the content of L tryptophan in the supernatant was determined by a bio assay using In order to obtain AJ12157 and M247, it is possible to cure composite plasmids from AJ12158 and AJ12160 without damaging the host cells. Plasmids may be lost spontaneously from host cells or can be artificially eliminated by a curing operation Bact.
