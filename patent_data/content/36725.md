# Improved electrical switch construction.

## Abstract
The switch assembly has a base on which is pivotably mounted a rotor having a switch blade movable between positions where it is in contact and out of contact with a switch jaw. The rotor is moved by a handle 52 mounted on a side wall of the switch box via a cam plate 58 . The cam plate 58 has an extension 80 connected to a biassing spring 92 which surrounds a rod 90 in a pivotable guide channel 86 mounted on the wall. The spring provides a quick make break mechanism which provides a snap engage disengage action for the contacts. This provides a clean switching action and prevents arcing and erosion of the contacts. The switch is used in high current devices. When the handle is moved to the on the cam plate 58 rotates, compressing the spring until the rod passes over the centre of rotation of the cam plate when the energy in the spring is released to rapidly rotate the plate independently of the handle.

## Description
IMPROVED ELECTRICAL SWITCH CONSTRUCTIONBACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to a high current capacity electrical switch permitting rapid engagement and disengagement of the switching contacts, known as a quick make quick break mechanism. In switches with a high current capacity, the contact area of the switch blades and the switch jaws is quite large. Accordingly, considerable force is generally required to engage and disengage the switch blades from the switch jaws.Additionally, to prevent arcing and erosion of the contacting parts due to the high current loads, it is required that the blades be engaged and disengaged from the jaws with the greatest speed. The requirements for large engagement force and rapidity of engagement and disengagement are generally mutually exclusive. Over the years, a number of switch mechanisms which utilize a quick make quick break mechanism have been developed and offered for sale. These mechanisms generally utilize some form of energy release by a spring to increase the speed of engagement and disengagement of the switch blades. Moreover, lost motion mechanisms are required so that the rapid engagement and disengagement of the switch blades is not transmitted back to the handle of the mechanism. However, many of the prior devices are mechanically complex and are thus relatively large and expensive as well as prone to failure. The instant invention is directed to overcoming some of the disadvantages of the prior switch mechanisms. In accordance with the present invention an improved quick make quick break switch mechanism is provided, which includes a rotor carrying switch blades to make and break electrical contact. The rotor is coupled to a cam plate, which, in turn, is driven by an external handle through a fastener which permits the rotor to operate independently of the handle at certain positions during the engagement and disengagement of the contacts. The cam plate is coupled to a spring mechanism which releases the energy stored by the compressed spring to rapidly open and close the contacts. The device includes an interlock to prevent the handle from being moved into the on position when the cover of the enclosure is opened. The device utilizes a side wall of the switch box as an integral mount for the elements of the rotor actlvatag mechanism. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide an improved switch mechanism capable of rapidly engaging and disengaging the switch elements. It is another object of this invention to provide an improved switch mechanism which is simple and compact. It is another object of this invention to provide an improved quick make quick break mechanism that is relatively inexpensive and easily manufactured. It is another object of this invention to provide an improved switch mechanism in which the handle cannot give a false indication of the switch position. It is another object of this invention to provide an improved switch mechanism which can be assembled without the need for threaded fasteners. Still other objects of this invention will become apparent upon a reading of the detailed specification to follow.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS For a better understanding of the invention, reference is made to the following drawings taken in connection with the specification, in whiiiii Fig. 1 is a top plan view of the improved switch mechanism according to the present invention, with the cover opened Fig. 2 is a sectional view, with the cover partially cut away, taken along line 2 2 of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a view taken along line 3 3 of Fig. 2 Fig. 4 is a view taken along line 4 4 of Fig. 2 Fig. 5 is a sectional view of the switch mechanism shown in the off position and Fig. 6 is a sectional view showing the switch mechanism in its on position.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The drawings illustrate an improved electrical switching assembly 10, of the type commonly known as a quick make quick break mechanism. Assembly 10 is disposed in a common rectangular switch box 12, which is generally constructed of metal. Box 12 has a door 14 connected thereto by means of hinges 16. A sidewall 18 of box 12 has a latch 20 pivotally mounted thereto.When cover 14 is closed over box 12, latch 20 will be inserted in a hole 22 in cover 14. Latch 20 is biassed towards an endwall 23 of box 12 by means of a spring 24.When cover 14 is in place over box 12, a notch 26 on latch 20 will engage and prevent cover 14 from being opened without displacing latch 20. An opening 28 in latch 20 is provided to receive a padlock so as to lock cover 14 securely to box 12. Disposed within box 12 is a first fuse clip assembly 30 including individual fuse clips 32 arranged in a polyphase 3 conductor arrangement with screw terminals 34 arranged for connection to the circuit wires. A second fuse clip 36 having corresponding individual fuse clips 38 is arranged so that fuses of the proper amperage may j j inrwed between clips 32 and 38. Fuse clip assembly 36 is part of a switch base 40, which includes a pivotally mounted rotor 42 formed from insulating material and having three switch blades 44 extending beyond the periphery of rotor 42. Each fuse clip 38 is mechanically and electrically coupled to a corresponding switch blade 44 on rotor 42. Rotor 42 is pivotable from a first upper position shown in Fig. 1 and in solid lines in Fig. 2 to a second position in which switch blades 44 are in engagement with corresponding switch jaws 46 shown by the dotted lines in Fig. 2 . When rotor 42 is in its upper position, out of engagement with switch jaws 46, no current will flow through the switch and accordingly, it is in the off position. When switch blades 44 are in engagement with switch jaws 46 the switch is in the on position and current will flow from switch jaws 46 through switch blades 44 to fuse clips 38.Terminals 48 electrically connected to switch jaws 46 are provided for attaching the current carrying wires to the switch base 40. An additional neutral terminal 50 may be provided to ground box 12 and cover 14 to switch base 40. The means by which rotor 42 is displaced from its on to its off position and back, will now be discussed. The movement of rotor 42 is controlled by manually operable handle 52, which is pivotally mounted to wall 18 of box 12 as described below wIth a handle spacer 53 inserted therebetween. A guard 54 mounted to the outside of wall 18 serves to limit the travel of handle 52 and to protect the operator s fingers from the movement of the handle. Guard 54 includes an aperture 57 through which a padlock may be inserted to lock handle 52 in the off position. An upsetting rivet fastener 56 is fixedly joined to handle 52 and has two flat 56 a, 56b and two convex 56c, 56d surfaces. Fastener 56 extends through a circular opening not shown in wall 18 to pivotally mount handle 52 thereto. Disposed about fastener 56 is a cam plate 58 whose central section 59 includes an aperture 60. Thus, fastener 56 serves to rotatably mount handle 52 to sidewall 18 and cam plate 58 to wall 18 with a spacer 61 therebetween. As seen in Figs. 5 and 6, aperture 60 has a pair of straight 60a, 60b and concave walls 60c, 60d . However, the distance between straight walls 60a, 60b of aperture 60 is greater than that between straight walls 56a, 56s of fastener 56. Accordingly, lost motion can occur between handle 52 and cam plate 58, which engages an extension 43 on rotor 42. Thus, cam plate 58 and rotor 42 may be pivotally displaced a greater distance from handle 52. Cam plate 58 has a portion 58a offset from wall 18 including an outer curved wall 62 and an end wall 64. Assembly 10 includes a safety interlock 66, which prevents handle 52 from being moved from an off to an on position when cover 14 is open. Interlock 66 impedes unauthorized entry into the switch enclosure when the switch is energized. Interlock 66 includes an interlock arm 68 pivotally mounted to wall 18 by a rivet 70 having a slotted head. Interlock arm 68 has a rounded portion 72 at its uppermost portion and a spring 74 which biasses interlock 66 in direction A. Interlock 65 also has a second arm 76 having a right angle extension 78 at its outermost edge. Due to the force exerted by spring 74, extension 78 is biassed into engagement with wall 64 of cam plate 58, thus preventing any motion of cam plate 58 and rotor 42.In this position, rotor 42 will remain in the upper, off position. When door 14 is closed, a tab 15 mounted thereon will contact portion 72 of arm 68 and thereby rotate interlock 66 In directionB which will move extension 78 out of engagement with wall 64 to permit cam plate 58 to be able to rotate from the open, off position shown in Fig. 5 to the on position shown in Fig. 6. Interlock 66 nay be edge by inserting and turning a screwdriver in the slotted head of rivet 70, which will cause interlock 66 to rotate. The quick make quick break actuating mechanism will now be described. Cam plate 58 includes a further extension 80, which pivotally mounts a link 82, which in turn, is joined to a rod 84. Link 82 and rod 84 are preferably formed as a single unit. A spring guide 86 is pivotally mounted to wall 18 by means of a rivet 87. Spring guide 86 has a wall 88 normal thereto, which includes an aperture 90 through which rod 84 slidably extends. A spring 92 surrounds rod 84 and is disposed between wall 88 and link 82. The actual engagement and disengagement of rotor 42 and switch jaws 46 is rapidly and cleanly made by the release of the stored energy within spring 92.Starting from the off position as shown in Fig. 5, when handle 52 is moved in direction C, fastener 56 will first take up the space remaining between it and aperture 60 before cam plate 58 begins to move, as spring 92 holds extension 80 against a cam stop 94. After edge 56a of fastener 56 contacts edge 60a of aperture 60, cam plate 58 will begin to rotate in conjunction with handle 52. As cam plate 58 is rotated, spring 92 will be compressed until the longitudinal axis of rod 84 passes through the centre of rotation of cam plate 58. After passing through centre, spring 92 will begin to expand, and as it approaches the position shown in Fig. 6, edges 60a and 56a will become disengaged to permit cam plate 58 and rotor 42 to rotate quickly with respect to fastener 56.Thus, the release of the energy of spring 92 rapidly closes twitch blades 44 into switch jaws 46. When handle 52 is moved from the on position shown in Fig. 6 to the off position shown in Fig. 5, fastener 56 will begin to rotate cam plate 58, rotor 42, and compress spring 92 until the longitudinal axis of rod 84 passes over the centre of rotation of cam plate 58.At this time the energy in spring 92 will again be released to return cam plate 58 to the position shown in Fig. 5. Accordingly, it is noted that the energy stored by the compression of spring 94 will be rapidly released to control cam plate 58 and connected rotor 42, independent of the position of the handle, at the point of electrical contact, through the lost motion coupling of fastener 56 and aperture 60. Even though at the point of electrical contact handle 52 is independent of rotor 42, since aperture 60 at all times surrounds fastener 56, handle 52 cannot falsely indicate the position of rotor 42.This is an important safety feature of the above construction. It is apparent that the above described construction is compact and simple, with fastener 56 providing lost motion between handle 52 d dia plate 58 as well as mounting the components to sidewall 18 switch box 12. Thus, sidewall 18 is an integral mounting member of the rotor activating mechanism with a consequent saving of space Although the present invention has been described in conjunction with a preferred embodiment thereof, it is to be understood that modifications and variations may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as those skilled in the art will readily understand. Such modifications and variations are considered to be within the purview and scope of the invention and the appended claims.
