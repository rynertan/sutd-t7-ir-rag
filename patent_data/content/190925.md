## Description
This invention relates to a protection circuit for an insulated gate bipolar transistor hereinafter referred to as IGBT which drives the gate of the IGBT safely without accompanying overcurrent phenomena. Many types of power converters which convert d.c. to a.c. or d.c. to d.c. using IGBT elements have been proposed. This IGBT has an insulated gate and is operated in a bipolar mode. The IGBT has features of short switching time and low ON voltage. Therefore this element enables miniaturization, low cost and high frequency control of high power which cannot be performed by conventional bipolar transistors or MOS FETs. Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram of a fundamental chopper using an IGBT. According to Fig. 1, an IGBT 1 and a load 3 are connected in series to both terminals of a d.c. power source 2. Power is supplied to the load 3 by on off controlling the IGBT 1. In order to achieve on off control of the IGBT 1, serially connected power sources 4 and 5 for gate and serially connected NPN transistor 6 and PNP transistor 7 are connected in parallel, and the common connection point of transistors 6 and 7 is connected to the gate terminal of IGBT 1. Moreover, the bases of transistors 6 and 7 are commonly connected to an input terminal 8 for the driving voltage. When a positive signal is applied to the input terminal 8, transistor 6 turns on and the positive voltage is supplied to the gate of the IGBT 1 from the power source 4, resulting in turning on of the IGBT 1. On the other hand, when a negative signal is applied to the input terminal 8, negative voltage is suppied to the gate of the IGBT 1 to turn it off. In this case, the relation between ON voltage, that is, a collector to emitter voltage V It will be seen from Fig. 2 that the IGBT has intermediate characteristics between transistor and thyristor, that is, it shows constant current characteristics similar to transistor in low gate voltage area and low voltage drop in high gate voltage area. It is apparent that if the IGBT is driven at a higher gate voltage V However, there is a problem that the IGBT often breaks down due to overcurrent within the range as shown by hatching lines in Fig. 3, when a shortcircuit accident of the load 3 in Fig. 1 occurs, because the voltage of d.c. power source is directly applied across the collector and emitter. Considering such accident, if the IGBT is driven at a low gate voltage V Fig. 4 shows the switching characteristics of an IGBT, in which collector to emitter voltage V Thus, it is difficult to determine whether a shortcircuit accident occurs or not unless it is determined whether the high collector to emitter voltage is caused by either overcurrent or transient phenomena, since the turn on operation has the delay concerning the gate voltage V In the case of some types of IGBT, direct shortcircuit is prohibited. As to such type of IGBT, IGT Insulated Gate Transistor of GE corporation is known and introduced in, for example, Application of Insulated Gate Transistors Factory Electronics, 1983 . Figure 5 shows the safe operation area SOA of such IGBT and it is understood that, for example, the element having gate to emitter resistance R However, if the current larger than the rated maximum current is turned off, the so called latch up phenomena occur and collector current I EP A 72523 discloses a protection circuit for a MOS FET transistor in which fault current is detected by detecting the drain source voltage. This circuit comprises a gate voltage input circuit for converting an inputted control signal to generate a drive signal having a gate voltage and for supplying the same to a gate of a MOS FET a load connected with said MOS FET, first detecting circuit means connected in parallel with said MOS FET for detecting a drain source voltage of the MOSFET, and adjusting circuit means for lowering said gate voltage when the drain source voltage detected by said first detecting circuit means due to a fault is no less than a predetermined value. In this case, the gate voltage of the MOS FET is cut off when a short circuit current is detected. Such a circuit could lead to misoperation in which normal current is cut off. On page 20 of Volume 14D of a Circuit Designer s Casebook published by MacGraw Hill U.S., there is an article by W.J. Riley entitled Adding foldback resistor provides overload safety , which describes how an additional resistor can be included in a current limiting power supply regulator in order to provide effective current foldback overload protection. It is an object of the present invention to provide a protection circuit for an IGBT which can decrease the power loss during normal operation. It is another object of the present invention to provide a protection circuit for an IGBT which prevents damage to the IGBT when an overcurrent accident occurs. According to the present invention, there is provided a protection circuit for an insulated gate bipolar transistor IGBT 1 comprising a gate voltage input circuit 6,7 for converting an inputted control signal V The invention will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 6 is a circuit diagram of an embodiment of the present invention and the same reference numerals as shown in Fig. 1 denote the same elements. In Fig. 6, IGBT 1 and a load 3 are connected to a d.c. power supply 2 in series, and serially connected power supplies 4 and 5 and serially connected NPN transistor 6 and PNP transistor 7 are connected in parallel, that is, two transistors are connected complementarily. Bases of transistors 6 and 7 are commonly connected to the input terminal 8. Series circuit composed of a resistor 10, a capacitor 18, resistors 19 and 20, and a series circuit composed of a resistor 12, a light emitting diode 13a of a photo coupler 13 and transistor 14 are connected across the input terminal 8 and the common connecting point between power supplies 4 and 5. The common emitter connecting point of transistors 6 and 7 is connected to the gate of IGBT 1 through a resistor 11. The base of the emitter follower transistor 14 is connected to the positive electrode of the power source 5 through a diode 15, then connected to the negative electrode of the power source 5 through a resistor 16, and then connected to the collector of IGBT 1 through a resistor 17. An NPN transistor 21 is provided across the base of the transistor 14 and the positive electrode of power source 5, and the base of transistor 21 is connected to the common connection point of resistors 19 and 20. A photo transistor 13b of the photo coupler 13 is connected to the positive power source, not shown, through a resistor 24, and this transistor 13b converts the voltage generated at the common connection point of the transistor 13b and the resistor 24 to the logic level. This logic level signal is input to the latch circuit 23 and the output of the latch circuit 23 is input to an AND circuit which outputs logical multiplication of the output of latch circuit 23 and the control signal V The operation of the circuit shown in Fig. 6 is explained referring to a timing chart shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7, a shows the gate voltage of IGBT 1, b ON and OFF states of the transistor 21, c collector to emitter voltage of IGBT 1 and d the collector current of IGBT 1. In these charts, the continuous line denotes the condition when no abnormality exists in the load 3 and the short dashes line denotes the condition when the load 3 is in a shortcircuit state or near a shortcircuit state. First, when the load 3 is in a normal state, at the time t₀, the driving signal V At t₃, transistor 21 turns off and a reverse bias voltage is applied across the base and emitter of the transistor 14 because the bias voltage is generated by the current which flows through the diode 15 and the resistor 16. Therefore, the transistor 14 does not turn on unless the current from the collector of IGTI flows therethrough and through the resistor 17 more than the current flows through the diode 15 and the resistor 16. In this embodiment, the value of the resistor 17 is selected so that the transistor 14 is turned on when the collector to emitter voltage V Thus, if the transistor 21 is turned off, the transistor 14 does not turn on, thus the gate voltage V Next, if the load 3 is in a near shortcircuit condition, and at t₀ the driving signal V When the gate voltage V Because of turning on the transistor 14, the light emitting diode 13a of photocoupler 13 is supplied with current to emit light, and the receiver, the phototransistor 13b turns on and the input voltage of the latch circuit 23 drops. Since the latch circuit 23 has a delay element, the output of the latch 23 changes to L level at t₅. Accordingly, the driving signal V The reason why the latch circuit has the delay element is to prevent the misoperation and to suppress the surge voltage during breaking operation by the two step breaking operation in which the accidental current is decreased at t₄ in Fig. 8 first and then the collector current is made to 0. It is identified that the effective time interval between t₀ and t₃ is 2 3 µs and that the effective time interval between t₃ and t₅ is 5 10 µs. Fig. 8 is a circuit diagram of another embodiment according to the present invention, and the elements referred to by the same numerals in Fig. 6 show the same elements. In order to supply a charge current having a time constant, that is, the current flowing through the capacitor 18 and resistors 19 and 20, to the diode 15, the emitter of the transistor 21 is connected to the negative electrode of the power source 5 through a resistor 30, and the terminal of the resistor 20 is connected to the negative electrode of the power supply 5. According to Fig. 8 the collector current of transistor 21 once increases at an instant when the driving signal V This circuit composition makes it possible to detect accidents faster according to the decrease in the collect or to emitter voltage V Fig. 9 is a circuit diagram of a further embodiment according to the present invention. In this embodiment, the series connected circuit composed of a capacitor 18, resistors 19 and 20 and a transistor 21 is removed from the circuit shown in Fig. 6 and a capacitor 31 is connected to the resistor 10 in parallel. Fig. 10 is a timing chart for explaining the operation, in which a shows changes in the gate voltage of IGBT 1, b shows the changes in the collector to emitter voltage, and c shows the changes in the collector current of IGBT 1. In this chart, the continuous lines denote the condition when no abnormality exists in load 3 and the short dashes lines denote the condition when the load 3 is in a shortcircuit state. In this embodiment, the transistor 14 is in an ON state at time t₀, and when the driving signal V When the load 3 is in a normal state, since the collector to emitter voltage V In the above embodiment, the voltage adjusting circuit composed of a resistor 12, light emitting diode 13a of the photocoupler and a transistor 14 is connected to the bases of complementarily connected transistors 6 and 7. However, when the power loss is a minor problem, the voltage adjusting circuit may be connected to the common emitter point of transistors 6 and 7. Moreover, the technique to lower the gate voltage when the collector to emitter voltage exceeds the predetermined value is applicable to overcurrent protection of general FET. Fig. 11 is a circuit diagram showing another embodiment of the invention. According to Fig. 11, the photocoupler 13 shown in Fig. 6 is removed and a current detector 32 is provided between the emitter of the IGBT 1 and the negative electrode of the power source 2. The output of the current detector 32 is input to the latch circuit 23 through a level detector 33. In this circuit, the accidental collector current is detected directly by the current detector 32 and when the collector current exceeds the predetermined value, the collector to emitter voltage is adjusted by the same operation as described above. Fig. 12 is a circuit diagram of an embodiment of the present invention. According to Fig. 12, the voltage of the power source 4 is applied to the gate of the IGBT 1 through the complementarily connected transistors 6 and 7 to whose common base connection point the driving signal V It should be noted that Figures 12 to 17 concern preferred embodiments of the foldback part of the invention, the cut off part being omitted. The operation of this circuit is as follows When the transistor 44 is in an OFF state, the driving signal V Fig. 14 is a graph illustrating the operation by the control of the gate voltage V Fig. 15 to Fig. 19 are circuit diagrams of other embodiments according to the present invention. In Fig. 15, a resistor 46 is added to the Zener diode 45 in series. In this embodiment, the gate voltage V Fig. 16 is a circuit diagram of another embodiment of the invention, in which Zener diodes 47 and 48 are provided at collector and base of the emitter follower transistor 44. However, the Zener diode across the base and emitter of the transistor 44 and the resistor at the emitter are removed. In this circuit, two Zener diodes 47 and 48 determine the collector voltages V1 and V2 which vary the gate voltage V Fig. 17 shows a circuit diagram of another embodiment, in which a resistor 49 is substituted for the Zener diode and the Zener diode in Fig. 16 is removed. The fundamental operation of this embodiment is similar to that of the circuit shown in Fig. 16. Fig. 18 shows the control circuit which supplies the driving signal to the circuit shown in Fig. 12. In this circuit, the control signal V Fig. 19 shows a circuit diagram of another embodiment, in which the photocoupler 52 shown in Fig. 18 is removed and a current detector 56 is provided between the emitter of the IGBT 1 and the negative electrode of the power source 4. The output of the current detector 32 is input to the latch circuit 54 through a level detector 57. According to this circuit, the collector to emitter voltage of the IGBT 1 is adjusted by the same operation as described by referring to Fig. 18, based on the direct collector current detection. In the above embodiments, only one IGBT element is used. However, in the practical use, 4 or 6 IGBTs each of which has reversely connected free wheeling diode between collector and emitter are used to form a bridge. Moreover, in the above embodiment, the adjustment point of the voltage adjustment circuit including the emitter follower transistor is connected to input side of the amplifying transistor for gate of IGBT, but it may be connected to the output side of the amplifying transistor.
