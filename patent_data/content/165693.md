# DOOR CHECK MECHANISM

## Abstract
A door check mechanism uses elastic bushes 30 mounted for rotation on either side of an arm 14. As the door 12a, 12b is opened or closed, the arm moves past the bushes. The arm 14 has bumps 40 on it and the bushes 30 have to yield to allow the bumps on the arm to pass. The bushes have inner and outer rigid sleeves 34, 36 with a resilient core 38 between them. The resilient core provides the necessary resilience to hold the arm in its checked positions.
