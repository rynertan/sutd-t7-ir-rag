# Voice coil actuator and method of manufacturing a coil for such an actuator.

## Abstract
The winding 34 of a voice coil actuator 11 for a trans ducer positioning system of a disk data storage file, is wound on a composite layer of viscoelastic material 32 and an alumin ium foil 33 wrapped around the core 30 of a bobbin. This construction minimizes vibrations in a direction parallel to the coil axis which tend to occur as a result of rapidly energizing the coil during the seek and track following modes of the trans ducer positioning system. The aluminium foil 33 functions to increase the shear deformation of the viscoelastic material 32 and its modulus of rigidity.
