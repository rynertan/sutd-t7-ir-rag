It should be noted that only HSR8 reagents are expressly shown. he thia side chain of choice SR is derived from the corresponding mercaptan reagent HSR8, and thus the following list serves to further specifically disclose SR side chains of I which are of special interest. When the mercaptan contains a functional group which might interfere with the intended course of reaction, the offending group is covered. For example, when a basic nitrogen group is encountered NHR or NH2, for example it is usually protected by acylation e.g., CO2PNB and when a carboxyl group CO2H is present, it is usually protected by esterification e.g., PNB ester . Such protection also facilitates in the purification of products by chromatographic means. NB is p nitrobenzyl. Such protection is, however, not a necessary requirement for introduction of the SR8 side chain. It is recognized that SR8 side chains in which the R8 group contains one or more chiral centers can be added as racemic or diastereomeric mixtures to provide mixtures of diastereomeric products or can be added as resolved, somerically pure reagents to provide diastereomerically pure products. Since antibacterial activity and other pharmacological properties vary among isomers, it is frequently advantageous to prepare isomerically pure products by the introducton of resolved SR8 side chains. 1.

Similarly, by employing more of the active ingredient and less lactose, other dosage forms can be put up in No. 3 gelatin capsules, and, should it be necessary to make more than 145 mg of ingredients together, larger capsules such as compressed tablets and pills can be prepared. The following examples are illustrative of the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations TABLET PER TABLET 125 125 mg.Cornstarch, U.S.P. 6 mg.Dicalcium Phosphate 192 mg.Lactose, U.S.P. 190 mg.Magnesium Stearate Balance 800 mg. The active ingredient is blended with the dicalcium phosphate, lactose and about half of the cornstarch. The mixture is then granulated with 15 cornstarch paste 16 mg and rough screened. It is dried at 450C and screened again through No. 16 screens. The balance of the cornstarch and magnesium stearate is added and the mixture is compressed into tablets, approximately 0.5 inch in diameter each weighing 800 mg.
