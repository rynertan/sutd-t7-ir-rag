# Polyethylene terephthalate molding compositions.

## Abstract
Impact modified and moldability improved polyethylene terephthalate molding compositions are provided which com prise polyethylene terephthalate resins, a copolymer of α ole fins and glycidyl esters of α,β ethylenically unsaturated car boxylic acids and barium salt of fatty acids. Glass fiber reinfor cement of the polyester compositions is preferable because of further enhancement of the moldability of the polyester com position thereof. In addition, resistance to moist heat is also in creased. Including certain plasticizers of the ester type is of further beneficial effect.
