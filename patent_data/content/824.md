# Light weight packages comprising a skeletal container.

## Abstract
A light weight package 2 comprising a skeletal container 1 formed from a plurality of interconnected self supporting ribs 3 to 8 and having a sheet material 12 stretched around the container 1 , the ends of the sheet material being positively secured to a rib of the container so as to maintain a tension in the sheet material. The tension causes a compressive force to be exerted in the container which causes the container to become more rigid.
