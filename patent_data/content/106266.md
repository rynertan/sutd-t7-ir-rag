# Terpene solvent mixture useful for making liquid detergent compositions.

## Abstract
Liquid detergent compositions, particularly for use as hard surface cleaners, comprising 1 20 surfactant, 0.5 10 mono or sesquiterpenes, and 0.5 10 of a polar solvent having a solubility in water of from 0.2 to 10 , preferably benzyl alcohol. The compositions provide excel lent cleaning of both greasy and particulate soils, improved surface appearance, excellent formulation homogeneity, stability and viscosity characteristics as well as good suds control.
