## Description
This invention relates to certain dihydropyridines, specifically to certain 1,4 dihydropyridines having a substituted pyrimidinyl group in a side chain attached to the 2 position which have utility as anti ischaemic and antihypertensive agents, and to pharmaceutical preparations containing such compounds. The compounds of the invention reduce the movement of calcium into the cell and they are thus able to delay or prevent the cardiac contracture which is believed to be caused by an accumulation of intracellular calcium under ischaemic conditions.Excessive calcium influx during ischaemia can have a number of additional adverse effects which would further compromise the ischaemic myocardium. These include less efficient use of oxygen for ATP production, activation of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and possibly, promotion of cell necrosis. Thus the compounds are useful in the treatment or prevention of a variety of cardiac conditions, such as angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias, heart attacks and cardiac hypertrophy. The compounds also have vasodilator activity since they can inhibit calcium influx in cells of vascular tissue and they are thus also useful as antihypertensive agents and for the treatment of coronary vasospasm. According to the specification of our European patent application publication No. 60674 there are described and claimed a number of dihydropyridine anti ischaemic and antihypertensive agents wherein the 2 position of the dihydropyridine ring is substituted with certain N,N disubstituted aminoalkoxymethyl groups. Our co pending European patent application publication no. 100189 describes and claims a related series of compounds wherein the 2 position is substituted with an aromatic heterocyclylalkoxymethyl group. Our co pending European patent application no. 84304888.5 discloses a further series of dihydropyridine compounds wherein the 2 position substituent bears a hydroxy or oxo substituted heterocyclic group.We have now discovered a further related series of dihydropyridine compounds having valuable therapeutic properties wherein the substituent in the 2 position bears a pyrimidine group having specific substituents. Thus according to the invention, there are provided novel 1,4 dihydropyridine derivatives of the formula EMI2.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein R is aryl or heteroaryl R1 and R2 are each independently C1 C4 alkyl or 2 methoxyethyl Y is CH2 n , CH2CH cH3 or CH2C CH3 2 1 X is a group of the formula EMI3.1 wherein R3 is H, het, CH2 n het, NH het, NH CH2 n het, O het, O CH2 n het, CH2 n OH, NR6R7, CH2 nNR6R7 or NH CH2 pNR6R7 R4 is H, C1 C4 alkyl, CH2 pNR6R7, CH2 p OH or CH2 n het and R5 is H, C1 C4 alkyl or phenyl wherein R6 and R7 are each independently H or C1 C4 alkyl or the 6 7 two groups R and R are taken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached to form a pyrrolidinyl, piperidino, morpholino, piperazinyl or N C1 C4 alkyl piperazinyl group n is 1 4 and p is 2 4 with the proviso that when R4 is H or C1 C4 alkyl, R3 is not H or NR6R7. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the formula I are those formed from acids which form non toxic acid addition salts, for example the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate or bisulphate, phosphate or acid phosphate, acetate, citrate, fumarate, gluconate, lactate, maleate, succinate and tartrate salts. For compounds in which R4 is H salts may also be formed with bases, examples are the sodium, potassium and ammonium salts. The term aryl as used in this specification when R is phenyl or phenyl substituted by one or two substituents each independently selected from nitro, halo, C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, hydroxy, trifluoromethyl and cyano or is 1 or 2 naphthyl. The term heteroaryl as used in this specification when R is benzofuranyl benzothienyl pyridyl optionally substituted by methyl, methylthio, cyano or halo quinolyl benzoxazolyl benzothiazolyl furyl pyrimidinyl thiazolyl 2,1,3 benzoxadiazol 4 yl 2,1, 3 benzothiadiazol 4 yl or thienyl optionally monosubstituted by halo or C1 C4 alkyl. As will be understood by those skilled in the art the group X can be subject to keto enol tautomerism and the oxo group may be present either as a free hydroxyl group when in the tautomeric enol form, or as an oxo group when in the keto form. Which particular isomer is present in normal circumstances can be readily determined by appropriate physical measurements, such as for example by infra red spectroscopy, and, in some instances the compounds may exist as mixtures of the two forms. However it is to be understood that the invention includes both forms of the compounds where they can exist and, in the description andExamples hereto, references to the hydroxy or keto form of the compound include all possible tautomeric forms and are not necessarily to be taken to indicate which is the predominant tautomeric form of the compound. The term het refers to a 5 or 6 membered nitrogen containing aromatic heterocyclic ring which may optionally be substituted with for example, C1 C4 alkyl or C1 C4 alkoxy groups.Examples of het groups include pyridyl or imidazolyl such as 2 pyridyl, 4 pyridyl or l methyl 2 imidazolyl. Examples of preferred substituents for R include amino, aminomethyl, hydroxyethyl, 2 pyridyl, 4 morpholino methyl, 2 pyridylmethylamino, or 4 pyridylmethylamino. R5is preferably hydrogen. Examples of suitable substituents for R4 include hydrogen, 2 dimethylamino ethyl, l methyl 2 imidazolyl methyl, 2 hydroxyethyl or 2 pyridylmethyl. The term halo means fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo. Alkyl and alkoxy groups having 3 or more carbon atoms can be straight or branched chain. Compounds containing asymmetric centres will exist as one or more pairs of enantiomers and the invention includes the separated d and 1 opticaily active isomers as well as mixtures thereof. Preferred values for R are 2 chlorophenyl and 2,3 dichlorophenyl. Preferably R1 is CX3 and R2 is C H or R1 is C 2H5 and R2 is CH3 and Y is CX2 . Thus particular and preferred examples of compounds of the invention include the following 6 4 2,3 Dichlorophenyl 3 ethoxycarbonyl 5 methoxycarbonyl 6 methyl 1,4 dihydropyrid 2 yl methoxymethyl 2 2 pyridylmethylamino 4 pyrimidone. 2 Amino 6 4 2,3 dichlorophenyl 3 ethoxycarbonyl 5methoxycarbonyl 6 methyl 1,4 dihydroxypyrid 2 yl methoxymethyl 3 2 pyridylmethyl 4 pyrimidone. 2 Amino 6 t 4 2,3 dichlorophenyl 3 ethoxyzarbonyl 5 methoxycarbonyl 6 methyl l, 4 dihydropyrid 2 yl methoxymethyl 3 1 methyl 2 imidazolyl methyl 4 pyrimidone. 2 Amino 6 4 2,3 dichlorophenyl 3 ethoxycarbonyl 5methoxycarbonyl 6 methyl 1,4 dihydropyrid 2 yl methoxymethyl 4 2 pyridylmethoxy pyrimidine. The compounds of formula I may be prepared by a number of different processes according to the invention. a In one process, compounds of the formula I wherein R4 is hydrogen may be prepared from the corresponding dihydropyridine ketoester of formula EMI6.1 wherein R, R1, R2, R and Y are as previously defined and R is a C C alkyl group, by reacting with a compound of the formulaEMI7.1 wherein R3is as previously defined other than H and NE2. The reaction of the compounds of formulae II and III is generally carried out by stirring the reactants, in more or less equimolar amounts, in an organic solvent in the presence of a base. Suitable solvents are lower alkanols such as ethanol. A period of several days at room temperature may be required before the reaction is substantially complete and the product is then isolated conventionally using normal extraction, washing and evaporation techniques and purified if necessary by recrystallisation or by chromatography. The starting ketoesters of formula tri are prepared using the procedures described in our European patent application no.84304888.5 publication no. 132375 . The amidines of formula III are generally known compounds, either commercially available or preparable by conventional methods in accordance with literature precedents. b In an alternative process compounds of the formula I wherein R4 is hydrogen and R3 is NH CH2 n het or NH CH2 pNR6R7 and n, p, het, R6 and R7 are as previously defined, are prepared from a compound of the formula EMI8.1 wherein R, R1, R2, R5 and Y are as previously defined and Q is 2 or S C1 C4 alkyl by reaction with an amine of the formula NH2 CH2 nhet or NH2 CH2 pNR6R7 The displacement reaction is generally achieved by heating the compound of formula IV with excess amine at a temperature of 50 1000C. A period of up to 60 hours may be required for the reaction to go substantially to completion and the product is then isolated and purified by conventional means as previously described. The starting materials of formula IV are prepared by the process described under a using the ketoester of formula II and the compound of formula III wherein R3 is4NHNO2 or S C1 C4 alkyl , respectively. c In a further process for the preparation of the compounds of formula I wherein R4 is hydrogen and R3 is CH2 nNR6R7, a compound of the formula IV wherein Q is CH2 nCl is reacted with ammonia or an amine of the formula HNR6R7 wherein R6 and R7 are as previously defined other than hydrogen. The reaction is particularly suitable for preparing the compounds wherein n is 1 and R6 and R7 are both hydrogen. Thus, in this case, the appropriate 2 chloromethylpyrimidone is simply reacted with concentrated ammonia solution at room temperature for several hours to yield the corresponding 2 aminomethyl derivative R CH2NH2 . The starting materials of formula IV wherein Q is CH2 nCl are again readily prepared from the ketoester of formula II by reaction with the appropriate L3 chloroalkanoamidine , by the method described under process a . d Compounds of the formula I wherein R4 is other than hydrogen are prepared from a compound of the formula EMI10.1 wherein R, R1, R2, R3, R5 and Y are as previously defined, by alkylation with a compound of the formula R4 hal wherein R4 is as previously defined other than hydrogen and hal is a halogen atom, preferably chlorine. Substitution takes place either on the N 3 ring nitrogen atom to give compounds of the formula I wherein X is EMI10.2 or on the 4 keto oxygen atom to give compounds of the formula I wherein X is EMI11.1 Appropriate conditions to obtain the N substituted orO substituted product are well known to those skilled in the art.Thus alkylation with the appropriate halo compound in a protic solvent, e.g. N,N dimethylformamide in the presence of a weak base yields the N substituted product wherein X is a . Alternatively, alkylation in an aprotic solvent, e.g. toluene, in the presence of silver carbonate yields the O substituted product wherein X is b . In either case the products are isolated and purified using conventional procedures as previously defined. In some cases mixtures of two products may be obtained.These may be separated by conventional means e.g. crystallisation or chromatography. The ability of the compounds to inhibit the movement of calcium into the cell is shown by their effectiveness in reducing the response of isolated heart tissue to an increase in calcium ion concentration in vitro. The test is performed by mounting spirally cut strips of rat aorta with one end fixed and the other attached to a force transducer. The tissue is immersed in a bath of physiological saline solution containing potassium ions at a concentration of 45 millimolar and no calcium. Calcium chloride is added to the bath with a pipette to give a final calcium ion concentration of 2 millimolar. The change in tension caused by the resulting contraction of the tissue is noted. The bath is drained and replaced with fresh saline solution and after 45 minutes the procedure is repeated with the particular compound under test present in the saline solution.The concentration of compound required to reduce the response by 50 is recorded. The antihypertensive activity of the compounds is also evaluated after oral administration by measuring the fall in blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats or renally hypertensive dogs. For administration to man in the curative or prophylactic treatment of cardiac conditions and hypertension, oral dosages of the compounds will generally be in the range of from 2 100 mg daily for an average adult patient 70 kg . Thus for a typical adult patient, individual tablets or capsules contain from 1 to 10 mg of active compound, in a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or carrier. Dosages for intravenous administration would typically be within the range l to 10 mg per single dose as required. In practice the physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient. The above dosages are exemplary of the average case but there can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention. For human use, the compounds of the formula I can be administered alone, but will generally be administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. For example, they may be administered orally in the form of tablets containing such excipients as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs or suspensions containing flavouring or colouring agents. They may be injected parenterally, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. For parenteral administration, they are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic with blood. Thus in a further aspect the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. The invention also provides a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use in the treatment of cardiovascular conditions including use in the prevention or treatment of cardiac conditions, or use as an antihypertensive, in man.
