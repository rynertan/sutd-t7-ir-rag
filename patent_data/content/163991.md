Further objects and advantages of the door according to the present invention will be apparent from the description given hereinafter.The said objects are attained according to the present invention by a vehicle door of the type comprising an outer covering element provided upperly with a frame shaped portion defining on the outside of the door a window aperture for said vehicle, and an inner framework provided upperly with a corresponding frame defining said window aperture on the inside of the door, characterised in that said frame is provided on opposite sides with respective opposing seats for a pair of respective seal gaskets, a first of said gaskets internally bounding the edge of said window aperture and being arranged to cooperate in a fluid tight manner with the descending window pane of said door and for which it forts part of the slide seat, and in that said fr e shaped portion is provided with an inner flangeshaped edge disposed parallel to an outer lip of said first gasket and arranged substantially to hide this latter from an observer external to said vehicle.The present invention will be rore apparent from the iwn liniting description given hereinafter of one e bodisent thereof with reference to the acco panying drawing, in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic exploded perspective view of a vehicle door constrocted in accordance with the present invention andFigure 2 is a section on the line II II through the door of Figure 1 to an enlarged scale.In Figure 1, the reference numeral 1 indicates overall a door for any vehicle of knows type, not shown for simplicity, comprising an outer covering element 2 arranged to externally define said door, and an inner framework 3 arranged to carry preassembled all the accessories of said door such as the window regulator, the descending window pane, the locks and the inner finishing panel, and to be ousted on the production line rigid with the element 2 after painting the vehicle body, so as to fom the door 1.Such a door is known and is described in detail in Italian patent application No. 67336 A 82 of the present applicant, filed on 17 Narch 1982, entitled ,,Dor, particularly for motor vehicles, and a method for its assembly , the contents of which are incorporated herein for simple reference with respect to the necessary parts.The covering element 2 is provided upperly with a frame shaped portion 4 defining on the outside of the door 1 a window aperture 5, for example the side window aperture of said known vehicle, not shown for simplicity, and the inner framework 3 comprises a crossmember 4 arranged to carry said accessory devices of the door 1, and an upper frame 6 disposed in such a manner that when the door 1 is assembled it faces the corresponding frame shaped portion 4 of the element 2, and defining said window aperture 5 on the inside of the door 1. The frame 6 itself comprises an upper cross member 7 and respective uprights 8 formed preferably integrally with the cross member 7 and arranged to define respective slide guides for said descending window pane of the door 1, which is indicated by 10 in Figures 1 and 2.As can be seen in Figure 2, the covering element 2, and in particular the frame shaped portion 4 thereof, is formed by joining together a pair of respective suitably shaped and cut metal plates 11 and 12, whereas the frame 6 is preferably formed by moulding a synthetic plastics material and is rigidly fixed to the frame shaped portion 4 by respective connection elements constituted, in the non limiting example illustrated, by screws 13 screwed into suitable respective blocks 14 also of plastics construction.According to the invention, the door 1 is arranged to engage with the corresponding abutment seat 15 provided on said vehicle and defined by a sheet metal box section 16, illustrated purely by way of example in Figure 2 together with a portion of the roof panel 18 of said known vehicle, not shown for simplicity, and is arranged to define in the upper part, in the manner described hereinafter, the lateral drip element or drain channel of said roof panel 18, so as to be particularly suitable for use on vehicles without lateral drain channels.According to the invention the france 6 is substantially of L shape and comprises an upper rim 20 directed towards the interior of said vehicle, not dhown, and facing the seat 15, said rim 20 being provided towards the box section 16 with a seat 21 for a corresponding aeal gasket 22, and further comprises a lower rim 23 directed towards the frane dbaped portion 4 of the outer covering clement 2 and disposed substantially in line with the window pane 10, said rim 23 being provided with a seat 24 for a corresponding seal gasket 25 disposed in an opposing position to the seat 21.The seats 21 and 24 are provided on opposite sides of the frame 6 and are formed substsntially as channels of C and V configuration respectively, integral with the frame 6 and provided along the entire length thereof The gasket 25 internally bounds the edge of said window aperture 5 and is arranged to cooperate in a fluid tight manner with the window pane 10, for which it for s part of the slide seat at the uprights 8, whereas the gasket 22 is arranged to upperly define, together with part of the fraEe shaped portion 4, a lateral drain channel 26 for the roof panel 18. In particular, the frame shaped portion 4 is provided with respective opposing flange shaped edges 28 and 29 forked by the superimposed joint between the metal plates 11 and 12, and the channel 26 is defined by a pair of respective upper lips 30 of the gasket 22, by said edge 28 of the frabe shaped portion 4, and by a corresponding edge 31, facing the edge 28, of the roof panel 18.The lips 30 cooperate in a fluid tight manner with the edges 28 and 31 respectively, against which they are compressed with a predetermined force when the door 1 is closed, and the edge 31 preferably forms part of a plastics element 32 defining the side portion of the roof panel 18 surrounding the corresponding door 1, and is fixed in any convenient manner, for example by cementing, to the constituent metal plates of said roof panel 18.According to the invention, the gasket 22 also comprises a lower lip 33 orientated in substantially the opposite direction to that along which the lips 30 extend, and is arranged to cover the screws 13, being preferably cemented by sealant materials to the frame 6 so as to protect in a fluid tight manner the joint zone between this latter and the frame shaped portion 4, and further comprises a substantiallyT shaped rib 34 orientated substantially at 900 to the lip 33 and arranged to engage said C shaped seat 21 by insertion, so as to ensure the fixing of the gasket 22 to the frame 6.In contrast, according to the invention, the gasket 25 has a substantially X shaped cross section and comprises a first pair of lips 25 arranged to engage said V shaped seat 24 by insertion, and a second pair of lips 36 and 37 respectively, arranged to cooperate with the descending window pane 10 and to define said lateral slide seats therefor.According to the invention, the lip 36 cooperates with the inner surface of the window pane 10, whereas the lip 37 is disposed substantially in line with the window pane 10 and rests against the corresponding inner flange shaped edge 29 of the frame shaped portion 4, this edge being disposed parallel to said lip 37 so as to be able to substantially hide the gasket 25 from an observer external to said vehicle. Preferably, the lip 37 is cemented on to the inner surface of the flange shaped edge 29, whereas the lips 35 are retained in the seat 24 by a further element 40 inserted into said seat.On the side facing the box section 16, in a position corresponding with the seat 24, the frame 6 also externally carries a gasket 41 of knots type arranged to cooperate with a corresponding sealing ase,ly 42, also of known type, fixed in known Banner to tile box section 16. The advantages of the door constructed in accordance with the present invention are apparent from the description. The particular shape of the frame 6 and position of the seats 21 and 24 enable the gaskets 22 and 25 to he pre hunted on the frame 6 before the framework 3 is fitted on to the outer covering element 2 on the production line, and thns enables these operations. together with the mounting of the other door elements and accessories on the cross member 4, to be performed off the production line instead of on the production line as in doors of inown type. Furthermore, the particular arrangement and shape of the gasket 25 and the structure of the component elements of the door 1 enable the gasket outer seal lip, which cooperates with the descending window pane, to be disposed substantially in line therewith leading to considerable reduction in aerodynamic turbulence which can he created at the window aperture 5 when the vehicle on which the door I is mounted runs at relatively high speed. Finally no finishing elements such as chromium plated trims or the like are required on the door according to the invention for hiding the seal gasket of the window pane 10 from the outside. This is because this seal gasket is hidden by the presence of the flange 29, with the result that by virtue of the invention a door is obtained which is not only of pleasing appearance because of the absence of exposed gaskets, but is of relatively low cost and is very simple to assemble and dismantle, because of the absence of said finishing elements.Finally, from the description it is apparent that modifications can be wade to the invention without leaving the scope of the inventive idea.
