# Method of manufacturing a bundle of optical fibre parts.

## Abstract
A predetermined number of optical fiber parts 27 is provided on a rectangular frame 1 , the fibre parts extending parallel to each other along a straight line between two opposite first sides 3 of the frame. These first sides 3 comprise comb shaped fibre guides 5 with teeth 13 , between which the fibre parts 27 are guided so that the fibre guides determine a first relative distance between the fibre parts. The first sides 3 are pivotably connected to the two second sides 7 of the frame 1 , which is then deformed to a parallelogram until the portions of the fibre parts 27 located inside the frame have a predetermined second relative distance. A permanent connection between the fibre parts 27 is established so that a ribbon of fibre parts is obtained. A number of such ribbons can be stacked with the interposition of strip shaped spacers 29 to form a bundle.
