## Description
2, a Methylenepenam 3 carboxylic acids and derivatives thereof The present invention relates to 2,3 methylene penam 3 carboxylic acids and derivatives thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to penam derivatives wherein the cyclopropyl group fused to the thiazolidine ring is on the opposite side of the molecule relative to the 3 carboxylic acid group and the 6 amino group on the 2,3 methylene penam nuclei. More specifically, and in an absolute sense. the bridgehead carbon atom located at the 6 position of these new penams has the R configuration Cahn ngold Prelog method of designating absolute configuration . If the hydrogen atom substituent of this bridgehead carbon atom is designated as extending from the a face of the molecule, then the cyclopropylmethylene also extends from the a face. The 3 carboxylic acid group and the 6 amino group are all on the ss face of the molecule. It should be noted that in this spacial arrangement. the absolute configuration of the carbon atom in the 3 position bearing the carboxylic acid substituent is opposite to all known penam antibacterials. 2,3 Lower alkyl methylene penam 3 carboxylic acid derivatives wherein the fused eyclopropyl group is set forth without any stereochemical configuration are broadly disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,904,607 to Samiya et al. issuedSeptember 9, 1975. An analysis of the disclosure indicates that the compounds produced have the fused cyclopropyl group on the B face of the molecule with the bridgehead carbon atom located at the 6a position having the R configuration as noted above . Such compounds do not have the level and spectrum of antimicrobial activity of the present compounds. Similar compounds have also been disclosed in U.S.Patent No. 4,393,003 to Keith et al. issued July 12, 1983 but as noted above these compounds have the fused cyclopropyl group in the 13 position as stereochemically depicted in the Patent. Again the spectrum and activity levels are inferior to the present compounds. A further article by Keith et al. in TetrahedronLetters, 39 15 , 2445 2458 1983 discusses the mechanisms of action due to conformational differences in penam nuclei and their effect on penicillin antibacterial activity. Such disclosure does not include compounds wherein the methylene of the cyclopropyl group is in a down or configuration and the carboxylic acid group is in a the opposite and unnatural position.

The resultant material is chromatographed utilizing known techniques to isolate the alkali metal salt.XII e IaThe compound of formula XII is converted to the compound of formula Ia via any conventional technique for acylating and protecting an amino compound with a carboxylic acid from which R is desirable or an active derivative thereof, such as, the corresponding acid halide, e.g. phenylmethoxy carbonyl chloride, acid anhydride, e.g. chloroacetic anhydride, or active ester in the presence of a base, e.g.alkali metal Na or K hydroxides, carbonates or bicarbonates or tertiary amines, such as, triethylamine or pyridine. Suitable solvents include mixed solvents, such as, miscible solvents, e.g. tetrahydrofuran or acetone with water or immiscible solvents, such as, chloroform with water. Although the temperature is not critical the reaction generally proceeds between about OOC to 300C with about room temperature preferred. The compounds of formula Ia may thereafter undergo removal of the ester protecting group following the reaction conditions set forth in step XXI above. Thereafter the alkali metal salt may be reacted to form the acid by treatment with acid e.g., hydrochloric or sulfuric acid. In order to manufacture the easily hydrolysable esters of the carboxylic acids of the formula I compound the carboxylic acid is preferably reacted with the appropriate halide containing the ester group, preferably with the iodide. The reaction can be accelerated with the aid of a base, e.g. an alkali metal hydroxide or carbonate, or an organic amine, such as triethylamine. The esterification reaction is preferably carried out in an inert organic solvent, such as dimethylacetamide, hexamethylphosphoric acid bromide, dimethylsulphoxide or, preferably, dimethylformamide. The temperature is preferably in the range of about 00 400C. The salts and hydrates of the compounds of the formulaI, or the hydrates of these salts, can be manufactured in a manner known per se, e.g. by reacting the carboxylic acid of the formula I with an equivalant amount of the desired base, appropriately in a solvent, such as water or in an organic solvent, such as ethanol, methanol, acetone and many others. The temperature of the salt formation is not critical, it is in general room temperature, but can also easily be above or below room temperature, for example in the range from OOC to 500C. The manufacture of the hydrates usually takes place automatically, in the course of manufacturing process or as a result of hygroscopic properties of an initially anhydrous product. For controlled manufacture of a hydrate, a completely or partially anhydrous carboxylic acid of the formula I or ester or salt thereof can be subjected to a moist atmosphere, e.g. at about 100C to 400C. In the following examples the stereochemical configurations are set forth in either alpha or a and beta or ss in the written formulas. Example 1 F3R1 l R ,3 alpha,4 alphaii 4 benzothiazol 2 vldithio 3 F trifluoroacetyl Cphenylacetyl aminoi alpha C1 methylethenyl 2 oxo 1 azetidineacetic acid 4 nitrophenvl methy1 ester 6.35 g of seco penicillin, i.e. 3R 1 R ,3a,4a 4 benzthiazol 2 yldithio a 1 methylethenyl 2 oxo 3 phenylacetyl amino 1 azetidineacetic acid 4 nitrophenyl methyl ester, are taken up in 45 ml of CHIC13 which had been dried over sieves and then passed through basic alumina. To this mixture was added 45 ml of cold trifluoroacetic anhydride. The mixture was stirred at room temperature and after about 40 minutes, the reaction solution became clear.The reaction mixture was concentrated, azeotroped twice with toluene and once with dry CHCl3. The residue was dried in vacuo in a water bath with a temperature of 30 350C to yield the desired end product. Analysis by NMR indicated a trace of starting material remained.

Thereafter 1.12 g of calcium oxide was added to the reaction mixture and the mixture cooled to 0 C. A bromine solution 24.5 ml was added dropwise over approximately ten minutes following completion of the addition. Thereafter a cold mixture of ether 120 ml petroleum ether 95 ml was added and stirred for 10 minutes at 00. The reaction mixture was filtered through a bed of celite and the filtrate concentrated to yield a mixture of the a and ss bromomethylpenam imides named in the title toExample 2. The crude product was used as is for Example 3, wherein the thiazolidine sulfide was oxidized to a sulfoxide. For reasons discussed in Example 3, it is likely that some of the very labile trifluoroacetyl phenylacetylimide was hydrolyzed during the work up. Thus, the crude mixture described above also contains some imide hydrolysis product i.e. the 6ss phenylacetylamide as well as the imide.

The mixture was again cooled to OOC. 1.93 g of m chloroperbenzoic acid 85 percent pure in 20 ml of methylene chloride was added dropwise over 5 10 minutes and the mixture stirred for one hour in the cold. The reaction mixture was worked up by extracting with 12.5 Na2 SO3 three times , water one time and brine two times . The resultant organic phase was dried over Na2 SO4 and concentrated and the residue dried in vacuo. Thereafter the crude sulfoxide residue was chromatographed on silica gel using ethyl acetate cyclohexane for elution. The four isomeric bromomethylpenam sulfoxides of the title Example 3 were isolated from this chromatography. Structure assignment was made from theirNMR spectra. Normally, oxidation of penicillanic acids bearing a 6ss imide e.g. phthalimide yield the a sulfoxide , whereas oxidation of penicillanic acids with a secondary 6ss amide residue leads to the ss sulfoxides. The isolation of both a and ss sulfoxides from this reaction indicates some imide hydrolysis occurred in isolation of the products. R. D. G. Cooper and G.
