# Process control apparatus.

## Abstract
A process control apparatus wherein dynamic character istics of a process are identified in accordance with process inputs u t and outputs y t , so as to tune digital PID parameters Kc, Ti, Td in accordance with the identified dynamic characteristics G z ยน . The process 10 is an N input output process having an interference between the process inputs u t and outputs y t . Each transfer function G z ยน between a given process input and process output is identified. A transfer function Gp s between a set point signal r t and the process output y t is obtained and matched with that of an N input output decoupled reference model, to tune the PID parameters Kc, Ti, Td .
