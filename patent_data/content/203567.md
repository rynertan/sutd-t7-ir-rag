# Disazo dyes and dyeing method using the same.

## Abstract
Described are disazo dyes having three triazine rings, one of which is substituted with a reactive group of NR¹ A SO₂C₂H₄OSO₃M, wherein R¹ represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group A represents a substituted or unsubstituted phenylene or naphthylene group and M represents a hydrogen atom or an alkali metal. The disazo dyes are capable of dyeing cellulose containing fibers un der conditions conventionally employed for dyeing poly ester fibers with a disperse dye, making it possible to dye mixed fibers of cellulose fibers and polyester fibers in a single bath and in one step.
