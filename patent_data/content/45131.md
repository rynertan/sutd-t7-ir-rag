# Method of charging a borehole and method of blasting.

## Abstract
Method of charging a borehole 15 with a column of explosives as well as a blasting method wherein the explosive charge is detonable simultaneously or in time delay sequence by means of two or more elec trically initiated detonators. The method requires provid ing a loop 8 of an insulated electrical conductor throughout the length of the borehole and, as the bore hole is charged with explosives, sliding electrically ac tuable time delay detonators along the looped wire 8 so as to be positioned at intervals throughout the borehole 15 . The detonators are electrically coupled to the looped wire 8 by means of slidable toroidal transformer cores. The wire loop 8 , in turn, is electro magnetically energized by means of a second transfor mer core 4 and an A. C. energy source 1 .
