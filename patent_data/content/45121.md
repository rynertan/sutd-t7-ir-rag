# Foundry core or mold making machine.

## Abstract
A foundry core or mold machine utilizes a horizon tally extending frame 54 pivoted at one end which fixedly supports one box half 84 or cope and movably supports the other box half 83 or drag. A power ac tuator 69, 132 pivots the frame to clamp the box halves closed against a blow head or gassing head which may be shuttled thereabove. The drag box half is moutend on a cradle on the frame for movement toward and away from the cope or fixed box half and for pivoting movement to bring the box to a core or mold discharge or an inspection or disassembly position 190 when the box halves are not clamped against the blow head 39 or gassing head. Each box half includes a machine actuated stripping mechanism to insure re moval of the core or mold both from the cope and drag with the latter then placing the core on a discharge conveyor 173 . The conveyor may be of the flat belt type canted slightly to present a flat surface to receive the core or mold.
