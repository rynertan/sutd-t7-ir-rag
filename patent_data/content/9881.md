# Cobalt containing alloys.

## Abstract
A wear resistant alloy, which excluding impurities, has the following composition a about 50 to 70 of cobalt, nickel and iron b 27 to 35 of chromium c 5 to 15 of molybdenum and or tungsten d up to 2.25 of carbon and or boron e 0 to 3 of silicon and or manganese f 0 to 5 of one or more of titanium, hafnium, zirconium, vanadium, niobium, and tantalum g 0 to 5 of copper, and h 0 to 2 of one or more rare earths. The cobalt is the range 25 to 40 and the nickel in the range 4 to 12 There is from 0 to 7.5 of constituents f , g and h . The iron is present in a quantity not exceeding 25 . If there is 2 or more of carbon and or boron, there is more than 30 chromium. All percentages by weight . A welding or surfacing consumable which ignoring the effect of dilution by substrate is capable of depositing such an alloy may also be made.
