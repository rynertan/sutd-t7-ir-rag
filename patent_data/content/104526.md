# Convoluted plural layer filter assembly.

## Abstract
A filter assembly is provided comprising a housing a fluid inlet and a fluid outlet in the housing, each opening into a fluid chamber and, disposed in the fluid chamber across the line of fluid flow from the inlet to the outlet so that all flow from the fluid inlet to the fluid outlet must pass therethrough, a filter element composite comprising a filter sheet material sandwiched between layers of foraminous space sheet material, the filter element composite having an upstream side and a downstream side and separating the chamber into a first portion on one side to the filter element composite communicating with the fluid inlet, and a second portion on the other side of the filter element composite communicating with the fluid outlet the filter element composite being folded on itself in at least a double layer defining therebetween an open interior space in fluid communication with one of the first and second portions of the fluid chamber, the outer side of the filter element composite being in fluid communication with the other of the first and second portions of the fluid chamber the double layer filter element composite being arranged in a plurality of convolutions extending transversely across the fluid cham ber back and forth across the line of fluid flow from the fluid inlet to the fluid outlet, so that the fluid flow en route to the fluid outlet from the fluid inlet may pass at least twice across convoluted folds through the filter sheet from the upstream side to the downstream side thereof, between one portion of the fluid chamber and the space between the double layer of filter sheet material, and then in the opposite direction, back through the filter sheet between the space between the double layer of filter sheet material and the upstream portion of the fluid chamber.
