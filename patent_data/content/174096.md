# VECTORS FOR INTRODUCING DNA INTO BACTERIAL CHROMOSOMES OR FOR DELETING IT THEREFROM AND FOR THE PRODUCTION OF PROTEIN

## Abstract
An integration vector which may be used as a cloning vehicle for an engineered DNA sequence one wishes to integrate into a bacterial chromosome comprises a replication specific sequence capable of directing auton omous replication and stable maintenance of the vector in a bacterial host cell, and two restriction endonuclease cleav age sites bracketing the replication specific sequence so that the replication specific sequence can be conveniently ex cised. Upon excision of the replication specific sequence, the engineered DNA is capable of integration into the chromo some of a bacterial host cell of the same type as the host cell used for autonomous replication and stable maintenance, thus enabling replication of the engineered sequence as part of the bacterial chromosome. Precursors for such vectors are also described. Methods using such vectors are described for the microbiological production of a desired protein, for introduc ing artificially engineered DNA into the chromosome of a bacterial cell to replace a segment of chromosomal DNA, and for deleting a specific chromosomally located gene from a bacterial cell, are also described.
