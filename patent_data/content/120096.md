# Process for converting carbo metallic oils, and addition of MgCl2 to the catalyst.

## Abstract
A process for economically converting carbo metallic oils to lighter products. The carbo metallic oils contain 650 F material which is characterized by a carbon residue on pyrolysis of at least about 1 and a Nickel Equivalents of heavy metals content of at least about 4 parts per million. Theis process comprises flowing the carbo metallic oil together with particulate cracking catalyst through a progres sive flow type reactor having an elongated reaction chamber, which is at least in part vertical or inclined, for a predeter mined vapor riser residence time in the range of about 0.5 to about 10 seconds, at a temperature of about 900 to about 1400 F, and under a pressure of about 10 to about 50 pounds per square inch absolute sufficient for causing a conversion per pass in the range of about 50 to about 90 while producing coke in amounts in the range of about 6 to about 14 by weight based on fresh feed. The spent, coke laden catalyst is separated and regenerated in one or more regeneration beds in one or more regeneration zones by burning the coke with oxygen. MgCl₂ is added to the catalyst and is converted to MgO, which reduces sulfur oxide emissions, and a chlorine component, which reduces the CO₂ CO ratio, thereby reducing the heat output of the regenerator. The catalyst particles are retained in the re generation zone or zones to reduce the level of carbon on the catalyst to about 0.25 by weight or less. The regenerated catalyst is recycled to the reactor and contacted with fresh carbo metallic oil.

## Description
ADDITION OF MeSlo TO CATALYST Description Technicai FieldThis invention relates to processes for converting heavy hydrocarbon oils into lighter fractions, and especially to processes for converting heavy hydrocarbons containing high concentrations of coke precursors and heavy metals into gasoline and other liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Background ArtIn general, gasoline and other liquid hydrocarbon fuels boil in the range of about 100 to about 6500F. However, the crude oil from which these fuels are made contains a diverse mixture of hydrocarbons and other compounds which vary widely in molecular weight and therefore boil over a wide range. For example, crude oils are known in which 30 to 60t or more of the total volume of oil is composed of compounds boiling at temperatures above 650 F. Among these are crudes in which about 10 to about 30 or more of the total volume consists of compounds so heavy in molecular weight that they boil above 10250F or at least will not boil below 10250F at atmospheric pressure.Because these relatively abundant high boiling components of crude oil are unsuitable for inclusion in gasoline and other liquid hydrocarbon fuels, the petroleum refining industry has developed processes for cracking or breaking the molecules of the high molecular weight, high boiling compounds into smaller molecules which do boil over an appropriate boiling range. The cracking process which is most widely used for this purpose is known as fluid catalytic cracking FCC . Although the FCC process has reached a highly advanced state, and many modified forms and variations have been developed, their unifying factor is that a vaporized hydrocarbon feedstock is caused to crack at an elevated temperature in contact with a cracking catalyst that is suspended in the feedstock vapors.Upon attainment of the desired degree of molecular weight and boiling point reduction the catalyst is separated from the desired products.Crude oil in the natural state contains a variety of materials which tend to have quite troublesome effects onFCC processes, and only a portion of these troublesome materials can be economically removed from the crude oil.Among these troublesome materials are coke precursors such as asphaltenes, polynuclear aromatics, etc. , heavy metals such as nickel, vanadium, iron, copper, etc. , lighter metals such as sodium, potassium, etc. , sulfur, nitrogen and others. Certain of these, such as the lighter metals, can be economically removed by desalting operations, which are part of the normal procedure for pretreating crude oil for fluid catalytic cracking Other materials, such as coke precursors, asphaltenes and the like, tend to break down into coke during the cracking operation, which coke deposits on the catalyst, impairing contact between the hydrocarbon feedstocx and the catalyst, and generally reducing its potency or activity level.The heavy metals transfer almost quantitatively from the feedstock to the catalyst surface.If the catalyst is reused again and again for processing additional feedstock, which is usually the case, the heavy metals can accumulate on the catalyst to the point that they unfavorably alter the composition of the catalyst and or the nature of its effect upon the feedstock.For example, vanadium tends to form fluxes with pertain components of commonly used FCC catalysts, lowering the melting point of portions of the catalyst particles sufficiently so that they begin to sinter and become ineffective cracking catalysts. Accumulations of vanadium and other heavy metals, especially nickel, also poison the catalyst. They tend in varying degrees to promote excessive dehydrogenation and aromatic condensation, resulting in excessive production of carbon and gases with consequent impairment of liquid fuel yield.An oil such as a crude or crude fraction or other oil that is particularly abundant in nickel and or other metals exhibiting similar behavior, while containing relatively large quantities of coke precursors, is referred to herein as a carbo metallic oil, and represents a particular challenge to the petroleum refiner.In general the coke forming tendency or coke precursor content of an oil can be ascertained by determining the weight percent of carbon remaining after a sample of that oil has been pyrolyzed. The industry accepts this value as a measure of the extent to which a given oil tends to form non catalytic coke when employed as feedstock in a catalytic cracker. Two established tests are recognized, the Conradson Carbon and Ramsbottom Carbon tests, the former being described in ASTM D189 76 and the latter being described in ASTM Test No. D524 76.In conventional FCC practice, Conradson carbon values on the order of about 0.05 to about 1.0 are regarded as indicative of acceptable feed. The present invention is concerned with the use of hydrocarbon feedstocks which have higher Conradson carbon values and thus exhibit substantially greater potential for coke formation than the usual feeds.Since the various heavy metals are not of equal catalyst poisoning activity, it is convenient to express the poisoning activity of an oil containing a given poisoning metal or metals in terms of the amount of a single metal which is estimated to have equivalent poisoning activity. Thus, the heavy metals content of an oil can be expressed by the following formula patterned after that of W. L. Nelson in Oil and Gas Journal, page 143,October 23, 1961 in which the content of each metal present is expressed in parts per million of such metal, as metal, on a weight basis, based on the weight of feed Nickel Equivalents Ni 4V8 Fe Cu 4.8 7.1 1.23According to conventional FCC practice, the heavy metal content of feedstock for FCC processing is controlled at a relatively low level, e.g. about 0.25 ppm Nickel Equivalents or less. The present invention is concerned with the processing of feedstocks containing metals substantially in excess of this value and which therefore have a significantly greater potential for accumulating on and poisoning catalyst.The above formula can also be employed as a measure of the accumulation of heavy metals on cracking catalyst, except that the quantity of metal employed in the formula is based on the weight of catalyst moisture free basis instead of the weight of feed. In conventional FCC practice, in which a circulating inventory of catalyst is used again and again in the processing of fresh feed, with periodic or continuing minor addition and withdrawal of fresh and spent catalyst, the metal content of the catalyst is maintained at a level which may for example be in the range of about 200 to about 600 ppm Nickel Equiva lent. The process of the present invention is concerned with the use of catalyst having a substantially larger metals content, and which therefore has a much greater than normal tendency to promote dehydrogenation, aromatic condensation, gas production or coke formation. Therefore, such higher metals accumulation is normally regarded as quite undesirable in FCC processing. There has been a long standing interest in the conversion of carbo metallic oils into gasoline and other liquid fuels. For example, in the 1950s it was suggested that a variety of carbo metallic oils could be successfully converted to gasoline and other products in the Houdresid process. Turning from the FCC mode of operation, theHoudresid process employed catalyst particles of granular size much larger than conventional FCC catalyst particle size in a compact gravitating bed, rather than suspending catalyst particles in feed and product vapors in a fluidized bed.Although the Houdresid process obviously represented a step forward in dealing with the effects of metal con taminatioh and coke formation on catalyst performance, its productivity was limited. Because its operation was uneconomical, the first Houdresid unit is no longer operating. Thus, for the 25 years which have passed since the oudresid process was first introduced commercially, the art has continued its arduous search for suitable modifications or alternatives to the FCC process which would permit commercialiy successful operation on reduced crude and the like. During this period d number of proposals have been made some have been used commercially to a certain extent.Several proposals involve treating the heavy oil feed to remove the metal therefrom prior to cracking, such as by hydrotreating, solvent extraction and complexing withFriedcl Crafts catalysts, but these techniques have been criticized as unjustified economically. Another proposal employs a combination cracking process having dirty oil and clean oitt units. Still another proposal blends residual oil with gas oil and controls the quantity of residual oil in the mixture in relation to the equilibrium flash vapori ationtemperature at the,bottom of the riser type cracker unit employed in the process. Still another proposal subjects the feed to a mild preliminary hydrocracking or hydrotreating operation before it is introduced into the cracking unit.It has also been suggested to contact a carbo metallic oil such as reduced crude with hot taconite pellets to produce gasoline.This is a small sampling of the many proposals which have appeared in the patent literature and technical reports. Notwithstanding the great effort which has been expended and the fact that each of these proposals overcomes some of the difficulties involved, conventional FCC practice today bears mute testimony to the dearth of carbometallic oil cracking techniques that are both economical and highly practical in terms of technical feasibility.Some crude oils are relatively free of coke precursors or heavy metals or both, and the troublesome components of crude oil are for the most part concentrated in the highest boiling fractions. Accordingly, it has been possible to largely avoid the problems of coke precursors and heavy metals by sacrificing the liquid fuel yield which would be potentially available from the highest boiling fractions. More particularly, conventional FCC practice has employed as feedstock that fraction of crude oil which boils at about 650 F to about 1000of, such fractions being relatively free of coke precursors and heavy metal contamination.Such feedstock, known as vacuum gas oil VGO is generally prepared from crude oil by distilling off the fractions boiling below about 650 cm at atmospheric pressure and then separating by further vacuum distillation from the heavier fractions a cut boiling between about 6500F and about SOOC to 1025cm. The vacuum gas oil is used as feedstock for conventional FCC processing. The heavier fractions are normally employed for a variety of other purposes, such as for instance production of asphalt, residual fuel oil, 6 fuel oil, or marine Bunker C fuel oil, which represents a great waste of the potential value of this portion of the crude oil, especially in light of the great effort and expense which the art has been willing to expend in the attempt to produce generally similar materials from coal and shale oils.The present invention is aimed at the simultaneous cracking of these heavier fractions containing substantial quantities of both coke precursors and heavy metals, and possibly other trouble some components, in conjunction with the lighter oils, thereby increasing the overall yield of gasoline and other hydrocarbon liquid fuels from a given quantity of crude. As indicated above,the present invention by no means constitutes the first attempt to develop such a process, but the long standing recognition of the desirability of cracking carbo metallic feedstocks, along with the slow progress of the industry toward doing so, show the continuing need for such a process. It is believed that the present process is uniquely advantageous for dealing with the problem of treating such carbo metallic oils in an economically and technically sound manner.One method for cracking these high boiling fractions, named Reduced Crude Conversion ROC after a particularly common and useful carbo metallic feed, is disclosed in copending application Serial No. 94,216 filed November 14, 1979 for Carbo Metallic Oil Conversion . The oils disclosed as capable of being cracked by the method of that application are carbo metallic oils of at least about 70 percent of which boil above 650 F and containing a carbon residue on pyrolysis of at least about 1 and at least about 4 parts per million of nickel equivalents of heavy mentals.Examples of these oils are crude oils, topped crudes, reduced crudes. residua, and extracts from solvent de asphalting The cracking reaction for the method disclosed in application Serial No. 94,216 is sufficiently severe to convert 50 or more of the feedstock to gasoline per pass and produce coke in the amount of 6 to 14 by weight based on weight of fresh feed. In a typical RCC cracking process the ratio of weight of catalyst to weight of feedstock is from about 3 to about 18, coke is laid down on the catalyst in amounts in the range of about 0.3 to about 3 percent by weight based on the weight of the catalyst, and heavy metals accumulate on the catalyst to a concentration of from about 3000 to about 70,000 ppm nickel equivalents.The unusually large amount of coke which deposits on the catalyst in carbo metallic oil processing presents critical problems. One problem arises from the exothermic reactions in the regenerator which convert coke to water, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Using a carbo metallic feed with its unusually high content of coke precursors as compared to FCC feeds, can increase the amount of coke burned in the regenerator and the temperature in the regenerator to the point that regeneration temperatures become excessive if there is thorough burning of coke. Excessive temperatures can permanently deactivate the catalyst and or damage the regenerating equipment.The heat of combustion of coke depends upon the concentration of hydrogen in the coke and the ratio of C02 toCO in the products of combustion. Carbon produces 13,910 BTU per pound when burned to C02 and only 3,962BTU per pound when burned to CO. Hydrogen produces 61,485 BTU per pound when burned to H2O. The heats of combustion of coke for three representative levels of hydrogen and four different ratios of C02 CO are given in the following table TABLE 1 Heat of Combustion BTU lb Coke Percent Hydrogen CO2 CO Ratio 2 4 6 0.5 8,362 9,472 10,582 1.0 11,038 12,083 3.0 14,446 4.0 12,912 14,894These problems encountered in regenerating catalysts coated with a high concentration of coke may be exacerbated when catalysts of the zeolite or molecular sieve type are used.Thse catalysts., which are crystalline aluminosilicates made up of tetra coordinated aluminum atoms associated through oxygen atoms with silicon atoms in the crystalline structure, tend to be quite susceptible to loss of cracking activity upon extended exposure to high temperatures. Also, it has been reported that they are more adversely affected by coke in respect to loss of cracking activity, than are certain other catalysts, such as for example the non zeolite, silica aSumina catalysts.Various methods have been used to control the temperature in the regeneration zone including cooling by heat exchangers external to the regenerator see U. S. Patent No. 2,394,710 , cooling by injecting steam or water into an upper, dilute phase zone of,a regenerator see U. S. Patent No. 3,909,392 , and controlling the oxidation reaction by controlling the amount of oxygen present see U. S. Patent No. 3,161,583 .These and othcr methods which have been proposed control the temperature of the regenerator for conventional FCC feedstocks having Conradson carbon residues below about one percent. However, processes for converting feedstocks containing Conradson carbon residues greater than about two percent require a method of heat control other than those normally used.U. S. Patent Applications Serial Nos. 94,094 and 94,227, filed November 14, 1979 disclose processes for the conversion of carbo metallic oils to liquid fuel in which various regeneration techniques are employed that assist in controlling the heat load in the regeneration step. It is thought that the ratio of C02 to CO may be decreased to no more than about 4 and preferably to less than about 3 in order to reduce the amount of energy released within the regenerator, while optionally providing a flue gas high enough in CO content to be a useful fuel. As will be appreciated the carbo metallic oils can vary widely in theirConradson carbon content.Such varying content of carbon residue in the feedstock, along with variations in riser operating conditions such as catalyst to oil ratio and others, can result in wide variations of the percent coke found on the spent catalyst. Accordingly, where the feed and riser operating conditions are such as to produce rather large coke yields, necessitating the burning of very substantial amounts of coke from the catalyst in regeneration, such as at least about 0.5 weight percent based on the catalyst, or more, additional measures for controlling the heat load in the regenerator may prove useful. One purpose of the present invention is to meet this need.A large amount of the organic sulfur in the feedstock is converted to H2S in the catalytic reaction zone and may be recovered from the cracked light petroleum fractions.However, a portion of the sulfur deposits onto the catalyst with the coke and presents an environmental Problem since SOX gases can form in the oxidizing atmosphere of the regenerator and leave the system with the flue gases. The amount of sulfur deposited on the catalyst increases as the amount of coke deposited increases consequently high levels of coke increase the difficulty of limiting 50x emissions in flue gases. Another purpose of the present invention is to meet the need for reducing SOx emissions. Summarv of the InventionAccordingly it is one object of this invention to provide a catalytic cracking method for converting carbo metallic oils to liquid fuels wherein the heat generated within the catalyst regenerator is reduced.It is another object to provide a carbo metallic oil conversion process involving controlling the heat evolved within the regenerator wherein the weight of coke burned is at least about 0.5 of the weight of the catalyst.It is still another object to provide a carbo metallic oil conversion process wherein the ratio of CO C02 in the regenerator flue gases is increased while effecting subs tan tially complete combustion of coke.It is yet another object to provide a carbo metallic oil conversion process including provision for reducing sulfur oxide emissions from the catalyst regenerator.It is yet another object to provide a carbo metallic oil conversion process which reduces sulfur oxide emissions from the regenerator and also reduces the heat produced within the regenerator. In accordance with this invention a process is provided for converting carbo metallic feedstocks containing 6500F material and having a residue on pyrolysis of at least about one and containing at least about four ppm nickel equivalents of heavy metals comprising bringing said feedstock in contact with a cracking catalyst in a progressive flow reactor under conditions whereby light products and coke are formed and coke and heavy metals deposit onto the catalyst. The spent catalyst is regenerated by contact it with an oxygen containing gas under conditions whereby at least a portion of said coke is converted to carbon dioxides, the regenerated catalyst is recycled to the reactor for contact with fresh feed, and MgC12 is added to the catalyst.The addition of MgC12 to the recirculating catalyst results in an increase in the CO and a decrease in the sulfur oxides emitted from the regenerator. While this process is useful for feedstocks having a Conradson carbon value of about one, it is particula rly useful for processing feedstocks having Conradson carbon values of at least about two, and it is especially useful for processing feedstocks having Conradson carbon contents greater than about 6. The invention is especially useful in meeting the heat removal requirements involved in regenerating catalyst which has been used in cracking carbo metallic oils containing sulfur and high concentrations of coke precursors and heavy metals and which are therefore heavily loaded with coke and sulfur containing compounds. The invention further provides a method of converting carbo metallic oils wherein the heat generated within the regenerator is reduced by decreasing the ratio of C02 toCO, to a low level, preferably to about 4 and more preferably to about 3, which helps to achieve a desired heat balance since the formation of CO produces less heat than does the formation of CO2. Depending on how the process of the invention is practised, one or more of the following additional advantages may be operated without added hydrogen in the reaction chamber. If desired, and preferablv, the process may be operated without prior hydrotreating of the feed and or without other process of removal of asphaltenes of metals from the feed, and this is true even where the carbometallic oil as a whole contains more than about 4, or more than about 5 or even more than about 5.5 pom NickelEquivalents by weight of heavy metal and has a carbon residue on pyrolysis greater than about 1 or greater than about 2 by weight. Moreover, all of the converter feed, as above described, may be cracked in one and the same conversion chamber.The cracking reaction may be carried out with a catalyst which has previously been used recycled, except for such replacement as reguired to compensate for normal losses and deactivation to crack a carbo metallic feed under the above described conditions. Heavy hydrocarbons not cracked to gasoline in a first pass may be recycled with or without hydrotreating for further cracking in contact with the same kind of feed in which they were first subjected to cracking conditions, and under the same kind of conditions but operation in a substantially once through or single pass mode e.g. less than about 15 by volume of recycle based on volume of fresh feed is preferred.While the reactions which take place are not known, it is hypothesized that the oxidizing atmosphere of the regenerator converts MgC12 to MgO and a chlorine component.The MgO reacts with the sulfur oxides forming solid compounds, and the chlorine component limits the formation of CO2. The reaction converting MgC12 to MgO may be represented by the following unbalanced equation EMI13.1 where X representsH, o or C1. The chlorine component which is the product will be referred to herein as wshlorineW although it may be in an ionic or molecular form, and free of or combined with oxygen.The MgO deposits onto the catalyst as it is formed1 recycles with the catalyst through the reactor and re generator, and within the regenerator reacts with sulfur oxides which may be present. Solid MgS04 and MgSO3 conpounds are formed, and are retained on and recycled with the catalyst particles to the reaction zone where HgO and H2S are formed under the reducing conditions within the reactor.The reactions may be summarized as follows EMI14.1 tb 2 SEP MgO SEP SEP SO2 SEP SEP 1 202 SEP MgSOq tb 3 SEP MgO SEP SEP 5 2 SEP SEP MgSO3 tb 4 SEP MgS04 SEP reducing SEP SEP gO SEP SEP H2S tb 5 SEP MgSO SEP reducing SEP MgO SEP SEP E SEP S tb The MgO, although it recycles with the catalyst particles1 ultimately leaves the system with the catalyst fines, and consequently must be replenished. The chlorine formed does not recycle but is carried from the system with the gaseous products. Unexpectedly, for a typical refining process the quantity of Mgcl2 which is needed to replace the MgO leaving the system with the catalyst is also sufficient to provide a high enough concentration of chlorine in the regenerator to increase the Co Co2 ratio.Both magnesium and chlorine can thus be provided in substantially optimum amounts by using the one component, MgC12. Brief Description of the DrawingThe figure is a schematic desian of catalyst regeneration apparatus and associated cracking apparatus which mav be used in carrying out this invention. Best and Various Other Illustrative Modes for Carrvinq out the InventionIn carrying out this invention to achieve both a reduction in SOx emissions and an increase in the CO Co2 ratio, the MgC12 is added to the catalyst particles in the system at a point where the chlorine formed will be carried into the regenerator. Chlorine formed within or carried into the reactor or spent catalyst stripper will exit with gaseous products, will not cycle to the regenerator, and thus, will not be available to help control the CO CO2 ratio. Consequently, in the preferred method of carrying out this invention the MgC12 is added to the regenerator or to one or more portions of the system from which gases will be carried into the regenerator.If increasing the CO C02 is not a goal the MgC12 may be added at any point in the system and may conveniently be added with any other fluid such as the petroleum feed to the reactor or with water added in any Dart of the system.The MgO formed in the regenerator recycles with the catalyst, and typically the only portion of MgO leaving the system is that which is carried out with catalyst fines.Consequently, the concentration of MgO will increase as MgC12 is added until the rate of addition of MgC12 is balanced by the rate of removal of MgO on the catalyst fines carried out of the system.The MgC12 is preferably added at a rate which will maintain the concentration of MgO within the svstem at a level of from about 0.25 percent to about four percent and most preferably from about 0.5 percent to about two percent by weight of the catalyst. Concentrations of MgO greater than about four percent may have a detrimental effect on the catalyst by forming spinels or glasses with alumina or silica.The spinels and glasses flow at regenerator temperatures, thus reducing the porositv of the catalyst particlesA further factor limiting the preferred MgO concentration on the catalyst to no more than about four percent for RCC processes is the relatively high concentration of heavy metals 3000 to 70,000 ppm nickel equivalents on the catalyst which leaves room for only a relatively low percent of MgOAn additional factor limiting the MgO concentration on zeolite catalysts is the alkalinity of MaO which, in concentrations significantly greater than about four percent, tends to neutralize the acidic catalysts.In view of the adverse effects high concentrations of MgO may have on catalyst particles, in the preferred method of carrying out this invention the MgC12 is added in such a way that there is no highly localized concentration ofMgC12 at the point of addition. This may be achieved by diluting the mgC12 with a liquid or a solid such as catalyst particles before introducing the HgC12 into a high temperature portion of the system. while the mechanism by which HgC12 reduces the amount of CO2 produced is not known, it is hypothesized that the chlorine produced from MgCl2 retards free radical formation and thus limits the oxidation of CO to CO2. Under typical conditions within a catalyst regenerator the following reactions may take place at temperatures in the range of about 1050 F to about 13000F EMI16.1 All these reactions occur to some extent in a catalyst regenerator, and when oxygen is present in a stoichiometric amount or greater the product will be predominantly CO2. Reaction 7 is probably initiated and propagated by free radicals, the formation of which is believed to be retarded by chlorine.The chlorine is removed from the system with the flue gases and therefore must be continuously replenished at a rate sufficiently high to provide a concentration useful in retarding the oxidation of CO to CO2. Chlorine in concentrations in the regenerator gases of at least about 100 ppm is effective in increasing the CO CO2 ratio, while significantly lower concentrations, as for exanple 50 ppm, do not appear to change this ratio. An increase in chlorine concentration increases the change in the CO CO2 ratio. However, factors such as cost and environmental considerations establish a preferred upper limit to the chlorine concentration at about 400 ppm.The concentration of chlorine in the regenerator is preferably in the range from about 100 to about 400 ppm and most preferably is in the range of about 100 to about 300 ppm based on the total weight of gases in the regenerator.The MgC12 may be added as a solid in powder form it may be dissolved in a liquid, either aqueous or organic or it may be suspended in a liquid, either aaueous or organic.The point at which the MgC12 is introduced determines to some extent the preferred state of MgC12. If the MgC12 is to be added with fresh catalyst, the same solids handling system can be used to introduce MgC12 as is used to add fresh catalyst. MgC12 added with the catalyst is therefore preferably a solid in the form of a finelydivided powder. The particle size is not critical and may suitably range from 10 to 500 microns, and is preferably in the size range of 20 to 140 microns, since particles smaller than about 20 microns tend to blow out of a fluidized bed with catalyst fines, and particles larger than about 140 microns do not fluidize as well as smaller particles.If the MgC12 is added suspended or dissolved in a liquid the addition can be made at any accessible point in the system, either in the regenerator or reactor or in lines passing between the reactor and regenerator. The addition of MgC12 to the regenerator, or to a portion of the system where the chloride component formed from the MgC12 will appear in the regenerator, will increase the CO to CO2 ratio as well as reduce the SO2 emissions.The addition of MgC12 to the reactor will reduce SO2 emissions, but the C12 formed will pass out with the gaseous reaction products, will not appear in the regenerator, and thus will not affect the CO to CO2 ratio.The present invention is notable in providing a simple, relatively straightforward and highly productive approach to the conversion of carbo metallic feed such as reduced crude or the like to various lighter products such as gaso line. The carbo metallic feed comprises or is composed of oil which boils above about 6500F. Such oil, or at least the 6S0 F portion thereof, is characterized by a heavy metal content of at least about 4, preferably more than about 5, and most preferably at least about 5.5 ppm ofNickel Equivalents by weight and by a carbon residue on pyrolysis of at least about 1 and more preferably at least about 2 by weight.In accordance with the invention, the carbo metallic fe d, in the form of a pmnpable liquid, is brought into contact with hot conversion catalyst in a weight ratio of catalyst to feed in the range of about 3 to about 18 and preferably more than about 6.The feed in said mixture undergoes a conversion step which includes cracking while the mixture of feed and catalyst is flowing through a progressive flow type reactor. The feed, catalyst, and other materials may be introduced at one or more points. The reactor includes an elongated reaction chamber which is at least partly vertical or inclined and in which the feed material, resultant products and catalyst are maintained in contact with one another while flowing as a dilute phase or stream for a predetermined riser residence time in the range of about 0.5 to about 10 seconds.The reaction is conducted at a temperature of about 9000 to about 14000F, measured at the reaction chamber exit, under a total pressure of about 10 to about 50 psia pounds per square inch absolute under conditions sufficiently severe to provide a conversion per pass in the range of about 50 , or more and to lay down coke on the catalyst in an amount in the range of about 0.3 to about 3 by weight and preferably at least about 0.5 . The overall rate of coke production, based on weight of fresh feed, is in the range of about 4 to about 14t by weight.At the end of the predetermined residence time, the catalyst is separated from the products, is stripped to remove high boiling components and other entrained or adsorbed hydrocarbons and is then regenerated with oxygen contain ing combustion supporting gas under conditions of tine, temperature and atmosphere sufficient to reduce the carbon on the regenerated catalyst to about 0.25 or less and preferably about 0.05t or less by weiaht. According to one preferred embodiment or aspect of the invention, at the end of the predetermined residencetime referred to above, the catalyst is projected in a direction established by the elongated reaction chamber or an extension thereof, while the products, having. lesser momentum, are caused to make an abrupt changelDf direction, resulting in an abrupt, substantiall inst taneous ballistic separation of products from catalyst.The thus separated catalyst is then stripped, regenerated and recycled to the reactor as above described.According to another preferred embodiment or aspect of the invention, the converter feed contains 650 F mater al which has not been hydrotreated and is characterized in part by containing at least about 5.5 parts per million of nickel equivalents of heavy metals. The converter.feed is brought together not only with the above mentioned cracking catalyst, but also with additional gaseous mate rial including steam whereby the resultant suspension nf catalyst and feed also includes gaseous material wherein the ratio of the partial pressure of the added gaseous material relative to that of the feed is in the ranf about 0.25 to about 2.5. The vapor residence time is in the range of about 0.5 to about 3 seconds when practising this embodiment or aspect of the invention. This preferred embodiment or aspect and the one referred to in the preceed ing paragraph may be used in combination with one another or separately.According to another preferred embodiment or aspect of the invention, the carbo metallic feed is not only brough into contact with the catalyst, but also with one or more addi tional materials including particularly liquid water j a weight ratio relative to feed ranging from about 0.04 to about 0.15, more preferably about 0.04 to about 0.1 and still more preferably about 0.05 to about 0.1. Such addi tional materials, including the liquid water, may be brought into admixture with the feed prior to, during or after mixing the feed with the aforementioned catalyst, and either after or, preferably, before, vaporization of the feed.The feed, catalyst and water e.g. in the form of liquid water or in the form of steam produced by vaporization of liquid water in contact with the feed are introduced into the progressive flow type reactor, which may or may not be a reactor embodying the above described ballistic separation, at one or more points along the reactor. While the mixture of feed, catalyst and steam produced by vaporization of the liquid water flows through the reactor, the feed undergoes the above mentioned conversion step which includes cracking. The feed material, catalyst, steam and resultant products are maintained in contact with one another in the above mentioned elongated reaction chamber while flowing as a dilute phase or stream for the above mentioned predetermined riser residence time which is in the range of about 0.5 to about 10 seconds.The present invention provides a process for the continuous catalytic conversion of a wide variety of carbometallic oils to lower molecular weight products, while maximizing production of highly valuable liquid products, and making it possible, if desired, to avoid vacuum distillation and other expensive treatments such as hydrotreatingThe term oils , includes not only those predominantly hydrocarbon compositions which are liquid at room temperature i.e., 680F , but also those predominantly hydrocarbon compositions which are asphalts or tars at ambient tempera ture but liquify when heated to temperatures in the range of up to about 8000F. The invention is applicable to carbo metallic oils, whether of petroleum origin or not.For. example, provided they have the requisite boiling range, carbon residue on pyrolysis and heavy metals content, the invention may be applied to the processing of such widely diverse materials as heavy bottoms from crude oil, heavy bitumen crude oil, those crude oils knorn as heavy crude which approximate the properties of reduced crude, shale oil, tar sand extract, products from coal liquification and solvated coal, atmospheric and vacuum reduced crude, extracts and or bottoms raffinate from solvent de asphalting, aromatic extract from lube oil refining, tar bottoms, heavy cycle oil, slop oil, other refinery waste streams and mixtures of the foregoing. Such mixtures can for instance be prepared by mixing available hydrocarbon fractions, including oils, tars, pitches and the like.Also, powdered coal may be suspended in the carbo metallic oil. Persons skilled in the art are aware of techniques for demetalation of carbometallic oils, and demetalated oils may be converted using the invention but is is an advantage of the invention that it can employ as feedstock carbo metallic oils that have had no prior demetalation treatment. Likewise, the invention can be applied to hydrotreated feedstocks but it is an advantage of the invention that it can successfully convert carbo metallic oils which have had substantially no prior hydrotreatment. However, the preferred application of the process is to reduced crude, i.e., that fraction of crude oil boiling at and above 6500F, alone or in admixture with virgin gas oils.While the use of material that has been subjected to prior vacuum distillation is not excluded, it is an advantage of the invention that it can satisfactorily process material which has had no prior vacuum distillation, thus saving on capital investment and operating costs as compared to conventionalFCC processes that require a vacuum distillation unit.In accordance with the invention one provides a carbometallic oil feedstock, at least about 70 , more preferably at least about 85e and still more preferably about 100t by volume of which boils at and above about 6500F. All boiling temperatures herein are based on standard atmospheric pressure conditions. In carbo metallic oil partly or wholly composed of material which boils at and above about 6500F, such material is referred to herein as 6500F material and 650 Ff material which is part of or has been separated from an oil containing components boiling above and below 65dot may be referred to as a 6500F fraction.but the terms boils above and 6500F are not intanded to imply that all of the material characterized by said terms will have the capability of boiling. The carbometallic oils contemplated by the invention may contain material which may not boil under any conditions for exarriple, certain asphalts and asphaltenes may crack thermally during distillation, apparently without boiling. Thus, for example, when it is said that the feed comprises at least about 79g by volume of material which boils above about 6500F, it should be understood that the 703 in question may include some material which will not boil or volatilize at any temperature.These non boilable materials when present, may frequently or for the most part be concentrated in portions of the feed which do not boil below about 10000F, 10250F or higher. Thus, when it is said that at least about 10 , more preferably about 15 and still more preferably at least about 208 by volume of the 6500F fraction will not boil below about 10000F or 10250F, it should be understood that all or any part of the material not boiling below about 1000C or 10250F, may or may not be volatile at and above the indicated temperatures. Preferably, the contemplated feeds, or at least the 6500F material therein, have a carbon residue on pyrolysis of at least about 2 or greater. For example, the Conradson carbon content may be in the range of about 2 to about 12 and most frequently at least about 4. A particulrlv common range is about 4 to about 8. Those feeds having aConradson carbon content greater than about 6 especially need special means for controlling excess heat.Preferably, the feed has an average composition characterized by an atomic hydrogen to carbon ratio in the range of about 1.2 to about 1.9, and preferably about 1.3 to about 1.8.The carbo metallic feeds employed in accordance with the invention, or at least the 650oft material therein, may contain at least about 4 parts per million of NickelEquivalents, as defined above, of which at least about 2 parts per million is nickel as metal, by weight . Carbometallic oils within the above range can be prepared from mixtures of two or more oils, some of which do and do not contain the quantities of Nickel Equivalents and nickel set forth above. It should also be noted that the above values for Nickel Equivalents and nickel represent timeweighted averages for a substantial period of operation of the conversion unit, such as one month, for example.It should also be noted that the heavy metals have in certain circumstances exhibited some lessening of poisoning tendency after repeated oxidations and reductions on the catalyst, and the literature describes criteria for establishing effective metal values. For example, see the article by Cimbalo, et al, entitled Deposited MetalsPoison FCC Catalyst , Oil and Gas Journal, May 15, 1972, pp 112 122, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.If considered necessary or desirable, the contents of Nickel Equivalents and nickel in the carbometallic oils processed according to the invention may be expressed in terms of effective metal values. Notwith standing the gradual reduction in poisoning activity noted by Cimbalo, et al, the regeneration of catalyst under normal FCC regeneration conditions may not, and usually does not, severely impair the denydrogenation, demethanation and aromatic condensation activity of heavy metals accumulated on cracking catalyst.It is known that about 0.2 to about 5 weight per cent of sulfur in the form of elemental sulfur and or its compounds but reported as elemental sulfur based on the weight of feed appears in FCC feeds and that the sulfur and modified forms of sulfur can find that way into the resultant gasoline product and, where lead is added, tend to reduce its susceptibility to octane enhancement. Sulfur in the product gasoline often requires sweetening when processing high sulfur containing crude. To the extent that sulfur is present in the coke, it also represents a potential air pollutant since the regenerator burns it to 502 and SO3. However, we have found that in our process the sulfur in the feed is on the other hand able to inhibit heavy metal activity by maintaining metals such as Ni, V, Cu and Fe in the sulfide form in the reactor.These sulfides are much less active than the metals themselves in promoting dehydrogenation and coking reactions. Accordingly, it is acceptable to carry out the invention with a carbo metallic oil having at least about 0.3 , accaptably more than about 0.8 and more acceptably at least about 1.5 by weight of sulfur in the 650cm fraction.The carbo metallic oils useful in the invention may and usually do contain significant quantities of compounds containing nitrogen, a substantial portion of which may be basic nitrogen. For example, the total nitrogen content of the carbo metallic oils may be at least about 0.05E by weight. Since cracking catalysts owe their cracking activity to acid sites on the catalyst surface or in its pores, basic nitrogen containing compounds may temporarily neutralize these sites, poisoning the catalyst. However, the catalyst is not permanently damaged since the nitrogen can be burned off the catalyst during regeneration, as a result of which the acidity of the active sites is restored.The carbo metallic oils may also include significant quantities of pentane insolubles, for example at least about 0.5 by weight, and more typically 2 or more or even about 4 or more. These may include for instance asphaltenes and other materials.Alkali and alkaline earth metals generally do not tend to vaporize in large quantities under the distillation conditions employed in distilling crude oil to prepare the vacuum gas oils normally used as FCC feedstocks. Rather, these metals remain for the most part in the bottoms fraction the non vaporized high boiling portion which may for instance be used in the production of asphalt or other by products. However, reduced crude and other carbometallic oils are in many cases bottoms products, and therefore may contain significant quantities of alkali and alkaline earth metals such as sodium. These metals deposit upon the catalyst during cracking.Depending on the composition of the catalyst and magnitude of the regen eration temperatures to which it is exposed, these metals may undergo interactions and reactions with the catalyst including the catalyst support which are not normally experienced in processing VGO under conventional FCC processing conditions. If the catalyst characteristics and regeneration conditions so require, one will of course take the necessary precautions to limit the amounts of alkali and alkaline earth metal in the feed, which metals may enter the feed not only as brine associated with the crude oil in its natural state, but also as components of water or steam which are supplied to the cracking unit.Thus, careful desalting of the crude used to prepare the carbo metallic feed may be important when the catalyst is particularly susceptible to alkali and aikaline earth metals.In such circumstances, the content of such metals hereinafter collectively referred to as sodium in the feed can be maintained at about 1 ppm or less, based on the weight of the feedstock. Alternatively, the sodium level of the feed may be keyed to that of the catalyst, so as to maintain the sodium level of the catalyst which is in use substantially the same as or less than that of the replacement catalyst which is charged to the unit.According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the carbo metallic oil feedstock constitutes at least about 70 by volume of material which boils above about 650 F, and at least about 10t of the material which boils above about 650 F will not boil below about 1025 F. The average composition of this 650 F material may be further characterized by a an atomic hydrogen to carbon ratio in the range of about 1.3 to about 1.8 b a Conradson carbon value of at least about 2 c at least about four parts per million of Nickel Equivalents, as defined above, of which at least about two parts per million is nickel as metal, by weight and d at least one of the following i at least about 0.3 by weight of sulfur, ii at least about 0.05 by weight of nitrogen, and iii at least about 0.5 by weight of pentane insolubles. Very commonly, the preferred feed will include all of i , ii , and iii , and other components found in oils of petroleum and non petroleum origin may also be present in varying quantities providing they do not prevent operation of the process. Although there is no intention of excluding the possibility of using a feedstock which has previously been subjected to so..e cracking, the present invention has the definite advantage that it can successfully product large conversions and very substantial yields of liquid hydrocarbon fuels from carbo metallic oils which have not been subjected to any substantial amount of cracking. Thus, for example, and preferably, at least about 85 , more preferably at least about 90 and most preferably substantially all of of the carbo metallic feed introduced into the present process is oil which has not previously been contacted with cracking catalyst under cracking conditions. More over, the process of the invention is suitable for operation in a substantially once through or single pass mode.Thus, the volume of recycle, if any, based on the volume of fresh feed is preferably about 159 or less and more preferably about 10 or less.In general, the weight ratio of catalyst to fresh feed feed which has not previously been exposed to cracking catalyst under carcking conditions used in the process is in the range of about 3 to about 18. Preferred and more preferred ratios are about 4 to about 12, more preferably about 5 to about 10 and still more preferably about 6 to about 10, a ratio of about 6 to about 8 presently being considered most nearly optimum. Within the limita tions of product quality requirements, controlling the catalyst to oil ratio at relatively low levels within the aforesaid ranges tends to reduce the coke yield of the process, based on fresh feed.In conventional FCC processing of VGO, the ratio between the member of barrels per day of plant through put and the total number of tons of catalyst undergoing circala tion throughout all phases of the process can vary widely.For purposes of this disclosure, daily plant through put is defined as the number of barrels of fresh feed boiling above about 650 OF which that plant processes per average day of operation to liquid products boiling below about 430 F. For example, in one commercially successful type of FCC VGO operation, about 8 to about 12 tons of catalyst are under circulation in the process per 1000 barrels per day of plant through put. In another commercially suc essful process, this ratio is in the range of about 2 to 3.While the present invention may be practiced in the range of about 2 to about 30 and more typically about 2 to about 12 tons of catalyst inventory per 1000 barrels of daily plant through put, it is preferred to carry out the process of the present invention with a very small ratio of catalyst weight to daily plant through put. More specifically, it is preferred to carry out the process of the present invention with an inventory of catalyst that is sufficient to contact the feed for the desired residence time in the above indicated catalyst to oil ratio while minimizing the amount of catalyst inventory, relative to plant through put, which is undergoing circulation or being held for treatment in other phases of the process such as, for example, stripping, regeneration and the like.Thus, more particularly, it is preferred to carry out the process of the present invention with about 2 to about 5 and more preferably about 2 tons of catalyst inventory or less per thousand barrels of daily plant through put.In the practice of the invention, catalyst may be added continuously or periodically, such as, for example, to make up for normal losses of catalyst from the system.Moreover, catalyst addition may be conducted in conjunction with withdrawal of catalyst, such as, for example, to maintain or increase the average activity level of the catalyst in the unit. For example, the rate at which virgin catalyst is added to the unit may be in the range of about 0.1 to about 3, more preferably about 0.15 to about 2, and most preferably to about 0.2 to about 1.5 pounds per barrel of feed. If on the other hand equilibrium catalyst fromFCC operation is to be utilized, replacement rates as high as about 5 pounds per barrel can be practiced.Where cir culstances are such that the catalyst employed in the unit is below average in resistance to deactivation and or conditions prevailing in the unit to promote morse rapid deactivation, one may employ rates of addition greater than those stated above but in the opposite circumstances, lower rates of addition may be employed.Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it appears that a number of features of the process to be described in greater detail below, such as, for instance, the residence time and optional mixing of steam with the feedstock, tend to restrict the extent to which cracking concitions produce metals in the reduced state on the catalyst from heavy metal sulfide s , sulfate s or oxide s deposited on the catalyst particles by prior exposures to carbo metallic feedstocks and regeneration conditions.Thus, the process appears to afford significant control over the poisoning effect of heavy metals on the catalyst even when the accumulations of such metals are quite substantialAccordingly, the process may be practiced with catalyst bearing accumulations of heavy metals which heretofore would have been considered quite intolerable in conventional FCC VGO operations. For these reasons, operation of the process with catalyst bearing heavy metals accumulations in the range of about 3,000 to about 70,000 ppmNickel Equivalents, on the average is contemplated. More specifically, the accumulation may be in the range of about 4,000 to about 50,000 ppm and particularly more than about 5,000 to about 30,000 ppm.The foregoing ranges are based on parts per million of Nickel Equivalents, in which the metals are expressed as metal, by weight, measured on and based on regenerated equilibrium catalyst. However, in the event that catalyst of adequate activity is available at very low cost, making feasible very high rates of catalyst replacen2nt, the carbo metallic oil could be converted to lower boiling liquid products wit. catalyst bearing less than 3,000 ppm Nickel Equivalents of heavy metals. For example, one might employ equilibrium catalyst from another unit, for example, an FCC unit which has been used in the cracking of a feed, e.g. vacuum gas oil, having a carbon residue on pyrolysis of less than 1 and containing less than about 4 ppm Nickel Equivalents of heavy metals.In any event, the equilibrium concentration of heavy metals in the circulating inventory of catalyst can be controlled including maintained or varied as desired or needed by manipulation of the rate of catalyst addition discussed above. Thus, for example, addition of catalyst may be maintained at a rate which will control the heavy metals accumulation on the catalyst in one of the ranges set forth above.In general, it is preferred to employ a catalyst having a relatively high level of cracking activity, providing high levels of conversion and productivity at low residence times. The conversion capabilities of the catalyst may be expressed in terms of the conversion produced during actual operation of the process and or in terms of conversion produced in standard catalyst activity tests. For example, it is preferred to employ catalyst which, in the course of extended operation in the process, is sufficiently active for sustaining a level of conversion of at least about 508 and more preferably at least about 602. In this connection, conversion is expressed in liquid volume percent, based on fresh feed. Also, for example, the preferred catalyst may be defined as one which, in its virgin or equilibrium state, exhibits a specified activity expressed as a volume percentage derived by the MAT microactivity test . For purposes of the present invention the foregoing percentage is the volume percentage of stsn dard feedstock that is converted to 4300F end point gasoline and lighter products at 900 F, 16 whsv weight hourly space velocity , calculated on the basis of catalyst dried at 1100 OF and 3C O catalyst to oil ratio by tentative ASH MAT test D 32,.using an appropriate standard feedstock, e.g.Davison HPS I2 primary gas oilThe end point of the gasoline produced in the L lAT test is often defined as 4300F tb true boiling point which is a standard laboratory distillation, but other end points could serve equally well for our present purposes. Conversion is calculated by subtracting from 100 the volume percent based on fresh feed of those products heavier than gasoline which remain in the recovered product.The catalyst may be introduced into the process in its virgin form or, as previously indicated, in other than virgin form e.g. one may use equilibri n catalyst withdawn from another unit, such as catalyst that has been employed in the cracking of a different feed. When characterized on the basis of MAT activity, the preferred catalysts may be described on the basis of their MAT activity as introduced into the process of the present invention, or on the basis of their as withdrawn or equilibrium MAT activity in the process of the present invention1 or on both of these bases.A preferred MAT activity for virgin and non virgin catalyst as introduced into the process of the present invention is at least about 60 , but it will be appreciated that, particularly in the case of non virgin catalysts supplied at high addition rates, lower MAT activity levels may be acceptable. An acceptable as withdrawn or equilibrium MAT activity level of catalyst which has been used in the process of the present invention is about 205 or more, but about 40 or more and preferably about 60 or more are preferred values.Ona .ay employ any hydrocarbon cracking catalyst having the above indicated conversion capabilities. A particularly preferred class of catalysts includes those which have pore structures into which molecules of feed material may enter for adsorption and or for contact with active catalytic sites within or adjacent the pores. Various types of catalysts are available within this classification, including for example the layered silicates, e.g. smectites.Although the most widely available catalysts within this classification are the well known zeolite containing catalysts, non zeolite catalysts are also contemplated.The preferred zeolite containing catalysts may include any zeolite, whether natural, semi synthetic or synthetic, alone or in admixture with other materials which do not significantly impair the suitability of the catalyst, provided the resultant catalyst has the activity and port structure referred to above.For example, if the catalyst is a mixture, it may include the zeolite component associated with or dispersed in a porous refractory inorganic oxide carrier in such case the catalyst may for example contain about 1 to about 60 , more preferably about 1 to about 40 and most typically about 5 to about 25 by weight, based on the total weight of catalyst water free basis of the zeolite, the balance of the catalyst being the porous refractory inorganic oxide alone or in combination with any of the known adjuvants for promoting or suppressing various desired and undesired reactions.For a general explanation of the genus of zeolite, molecular sieve catalysts useful in the invention, attention is drawn to the disclosures of the articles entitled Refinery Catalysts Are a Fluid Business and Making CatCrackers Work On Varied Diet , appearing respectively in the July 26, 1978 and September 13, 1978 issues of Chemical Week magazine. The descriptions of the aforementioned publications are incorporated herein by reference. For the most part, the zeolite components of the zeolitecontaining catalysts will be those which are known to be useful in FCC cracking processes. In general, these are crystalline aluminosilicates, typically made up of tetra coordinated aluminum atoms associated through oxygen atoms with adjacent silicon atoms in the crystal structure.However, the term zeolite as used in this disclosure contemplates not only aluminosilicates, but also substances in which the aluminum has been partly or wholly replaced, such as for instance by gallium and or other metal atoms, and further includes substances in which all or part of the silicon has been replaced, such as for instance by germanium. Titanium and zirconium substitution may also be practiced.Most zeolites are prepared or occur naturally in the sod 3 form, so that sodium cations are associated with the electro negative sites in the crystal structure. The sodium cations tend to make zeolites inactive and much less stable when exposed to hydrocarbon conversion conditions, particularly high temperatures. Accordingly, the zeolite may be ion exchanged, and where the zeolite is a component of a catalyst composition, such ion exchanging may occur before or after incorporation of the zeolite as a component of the composition. Suitable cations for replacement of sodium in the zeolite crystal structure include ammonium decomposable to hydrogen , hydrogen, rare earth metals, alkaline earth metals, etc. Various suitable ion exchange procedures and cations which may be exchanged into the zeolite crystal structure are well known to those skilled in the art. Exules of the naturally occuring crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites which may be used as or included in the catalyst for the present invention are faujasite, mordenite, clinoptilote, chabazite, analcite, crionite, as well as levynite, dachiardite, paulingite, noselite, ferriorite, heulandite, scolccite, stibite, harmotome, phillipsite, brewsterite, flarite, datolite, gmelinite, caumnite, leucite, lazurite, scaplite, mesolite, ptolite, nephline, matrolite, offretite and sodalite.Examples of the synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites which are useful as or in the catalyst for carry ing out the present invention are Zeolite X, U. S. PatentNo. 2,882,244, Zeolite Y, U. S. Patent No. 3,130,007 and Zeolite A, U. S. Patent No 2,882,243 as well asZeolite B, U. S.

Also, ZK 4HJ, alpha beta and ZSM type zeolites are useful. Moreover, the zeolites described in U. S. Patents Nos. 3,140,249, 3,140,253, 3,944,482 and 4,137,151 are also useful, the disclosures of said patents being incorporated herein by reference.The crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites having a faujasite type crystal structure are particularly preferred for use in the present invention. This includes particularly natural faujasite and Zeolite X and Zeolite Y.The crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites, such as synthetic faujasite, will under normal conditions crystallize as regularly shaped, discrete particles of about one to about ten microns in size, and, accordingly, this is the size range frequently found in commercial catalysts which can be used in the invention. Preferably, the particle size of the zeolites is from about 0.1 to about 10 microns and more preferably is from about 0.1 to about 2 microns or less.For example, zeolites prepared in situ from calcined kaolin may be characterized by even smaller crystallites. Crystalline zeolites exhibit both an interior and an exterior surface area, which we have defined as portal surface area, with the largest portion of the total surface area being internal. By portal surface area, we refer to the outer surface of the zeolite crystal through which reactants are considered to pass in order to convert to lower boiling products. Blockages of the internal channels by, for example, coke formation, blockages of entrance to the internal channels by deposition of coke in the portal surface area. and contamination by metals poisoning, will greatly reduce the total zeolite surface area.Therefore, to minimize the effect of contamination and pore blockage, crystals larger than the normal size cited above are preferably not used in the catalysts of this invention.Commercial zeolite containing catalysts are available with carriers containing a variety of metal oxides and combination thereof, including for example silica, alumina, magnesia, and mixtures thereof and mixtures of such oxides with clays as e.g. described in U. S. Patent No. 3,034,948. One may for example select any of the zeolite containing molecular sieve fluid cracking catalysts which are suitable for production of gasoline from vacuum gas oils. However, certain advantages may be attained by judicious selection of catalysts having marked resistance to metals. A medal resistant zeolite catalyst is, for instance, described inU. S. Patent No. 3,944,482, in which the catalyst contains 1 40 weight percent of a rare earth exchanged zeolite, the balance being a refractory metal oxide having speci iea pore volume and size distribution. Other catalysts described as zzetals tolerant are described in the above mentionedCimbalo et al article.In general, it is preferred to employ catalysts having an over all particle size in the range of about 5 to about 160, more preferably about 40 to about 120, and most preferably about40 to about 80 microns.The catalyst composition may also include one or more combustion promoters which are useful in the subsequent step of regenerating the catalyst. Cracking of carbometallic oils results in substantial deposition of coke on the catalyst, which coke reduces the activity of the catalyst. Thus, in order to restore the activity of the catalyst the coke is burned off in a regeneration step, in which the coke is converted to combustion gases including carbon monoxide and or carbon dioxide. Various substances are known which, when incorporated in cracking catalyst in small quantities, tend to promote conversion of the coke to carbon monoxide and or carbon dioxide. Promote s of combustion to carbon monoxide tend to lower the temperature at which a given degree of coke removal can be attained, thus diminishing the potential for thermal deactivation of the catalyst. Such promoters, normally used in effective amounts ranging from a trace up to about 10 or 20 by weight of the catalyst may be of any type which generally promotes combustion of carbon under regenerating conditions, or may be somewhat selective in respect to completing the combustion of CO, or, more preferably, for reasons explained in greater detail below, may have some tendency to combust carbon to carbon monoxide in preference to carbon dioxide.Although a wide variety of other catalysts, including both zeolite containing and non zeolite containing may be employed in the practice of the invention the following are examples of commercially available catalytic which may be employed in practicing the invention TABLE 2 Specific Weight Percent Surface Zeollte mê g Content A1203 SiO2 Na2O Fe2O, TiO2 AGZ 290 300 11.0 29.5 59.0 0.40 0.11 0.59 GR l 162 14.0 23.4 69.0 0.10 0.4 0.9CCZ 220 129 11.0 34.6 60.0 0.60 0.57 1.9Super DX 155 13.0 31.0 65.0 0.80 0.57 1.6F 87 240 10.0 44.0 50.0 0.80 0.70 1.6 FO 90 240 8.0 44.0 52.0 0.65 0.65 1.1EFZ 20 310 20.0 59.0 40.0 0.47 0.54 2.75HE 55 210 19.0 59.0 35.2 0.60 0.60 2.5The AGZ 290, GRZ 1, CCZ 220 and Super DX catalysts referred to above are products of W. R. Grace and Co. F 8 andFOC 90 are products of Filtrol, while EFZ 20 and EEZ 55 are products of Engelhard Houdry. The above are properties of virgin catalyst and, except in the case of zeolite content, are adjusted to a water free basis, i.e. based on material ignited at 1750 CF. The zeolite content is derived by comparison of the X ray intensities of a catalyst sample and of a standard material composed of high purity sodiumY zeolite in accordance with draft 6, dated January 9, 1978, of proposed AS t Standard Nethod entitled Determina tion of the Faujasite Content of a Catalyst. Among the above mentioned commercially available catalysts, the Super DX and GRZ l are particularly preferred. For example the Super DX has given particularly good results with Arabian light crude. The GRZ l although substant ally more expensive than the Super DX at present, appears some what more metals tolerant. GRZ 1 has been produced cc. . .er cially in varying formulations, the preferred formulations are those which are high in lanthanum to cerium ratio, relatively abundant in rare earths, contain at least 40g by weight of molecular sieve, and which has been highly washed to keep the sodium content as low as possible.Although not yet commercialiy available, it is believed that the best catalysts for carrying out the present invention will be those which, according to proposals advanced by Dr. James E. Lewis and Dr. William P. Eettinger, Jr., are characterized by matrices with feeder pores having large minimum diameters and large mouths to facilitate diffusion of high molecular weight molecules through the matrix to the portal surface area of molecular sieve particles within the matrix. Such matrices preferably also have a relatively large pore volume in order to soak up unvaporized portions of the carbo metallic oil feed.Thus significant numbers of liquid hydrocarbon molecules can diffuse to active catalytic sites both in the matrix and in sieve particles on the surface of the matrix. In general it is preferred to employ catalysts with matrices wherein the feeder pores have diameters in the range of about 400 to about 6000 angstrom units, and preferably about 1000 to about 6000 angstrom units.It is considered an advantage that the process of the present invention can be conducted in the substantial absence of tin and or antimony or at least in the presence of a catalyst which is substantially free of either or both of these metals.The process of the present invention may be operated with the above described carbo metallic oil and catalyst as sub stantially the sole materials charged to the reaction zone.But the charging of additional materials is not excluded.The charging of recycled oil to the reaction zone has alreac been mentioned. As described in greater detail below, still other materials fulfilling a variety of functions may also be charged. In such case, the carbo metallic oil and catalyst usually represent the major proportion by weight of the total of all materials charged te the reaction zone.Certain of the additional materials which may be used perform functions which offer significant advantages over the process as performed with only the carbo metallic oil and catalyst. Among these functions are controlling the effects of heavy metals and other catalyst contaminants enhancing catalyst activity absorbing excess heat in the catalyst as received from the regenerator disposal of pollutants or conversion thereof to a form or forms in which they maybe more readily separated from products and or disposed of controlling catalyst temperature diluting the carbo metallic oil vapors to reduce their partial pressure and increase the yield of desired products adjusting feed catalyst contact time donation of hydrogen to a hydrogen deficient carbo metallic oil feedstock assisting in the dispersion of the feed and possibly also distillation of products. Certain of the metals in the heavy metals accumulation on the catalyst are more active in promoting desired reactions when they are in the form of elemental metal, than they are when in the oxidized form produced by contact with oxygen in the catalyst regenerator. However, the time of contact between catalyst and vapors of feed and product in past conventional catalytic cracking was sufficient so that hydrogen released in the cracking reaction was able to reconvert a significant portion of the less harmful oxides back to the more harmful elemental heavy metals. One can take advantage of this situation through the introduction of additional materials which are in gaseous including vaporous form in the reaction zone in admixture with the catalyst and vapors of feed and products.The increased volume of material in the reaction zone resulting from the presence of such additional materials tends to increase the velocity of flow through the reaction zone with a corresponding decrease in the residence time of the catalyst and oxidized heavy metals borne thereby. Because of this reduced residence time, there is less opportunity for reduction of the oxidized heavy metals to elemental form and therefore less of the harmful elemental metals are available for contacting the feed and products.Added materials may be introduced into the process in any suitable fashion, some examples of which follow.For instance, they may be admixed with the carbo metallic oil feedstock prior to contact of the latter with the catalyst. Alternatively, the added materials may, if desired, be admixed with the catalyst prior to contact of the latter with the feedstock. Separate portions of the added materials may be separately admixed with both catalyst and carbo metallic oil. Moreover, the feedstock, catalyst and additional materials may, if desired, be brought together substantially simultaneously. A portion of the added materials may be mixed with catalyst and or carbo metallic oil in any of the above described ways, while additional portions are subsequently brought into admixture.For example, a portion of the added materials may be added to the carbo metallic oil and or to the catalyst before they reach the reaction zone, while another portion of the added materials is introduced directly into the reaction zone. The added materials may be introduced at a plurality of spaced locations in the reaction zone or along the length thereof, if elongated.The amount of additional materials which may be present in the feed, catalyst or reaction zone for carrying out the above functions, and others, may be varied as desired but said amount will preferably be sufficient to substantially heat balance the process. These materials may for example be introduced into the reaction zone in a weight ratio relative to feed of up to about 0.4, preferably in the range of about 0.02 to about 0.4, more preferably about 0.03 to about 0.3 and most preferably about 0.05 to about 0.25.For example, many or all of the above desireable functions may be attained by introducing H2O to the reaction zone in the form of steam or of liquid water or a combination thereof in a weight ratio relative to feed in the range of about 0.04 or more, or more preferably about 0.05 to about 0.1 or more. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it appears that the use of H20 tends to inhibit reduction of catalyst borne oxides, sulfites and sulfides to the free metallic form which is believed to promote condensation dehydrogenation with consequent promotion of coke and hydrogen yield and accompanying loss of product. Moreover,H20 may also, to some extent, reduce deposition of metals onto the catalyst surface.There may also be some tendency to desorb nitrogen containing and other heavy contaminant containing molecules from the surface of the catalyst particles or at least some tendency to inhibit their absorption by the catalyst. It is also believed that added H20 tends to increase the acidity of the catalyst by 3roosted acid formation which in turn enhances the activity of the catalyst. Assuming the H20 as supplied is cooler than the regenerated catalyst and or the temperature of the reaction zone, the sensible heat involved in raising the temperature of the H20 upon contacting the catalyst in the reaction zone or elsewhere can absorb excess heat from the catalyst. Where the E20 is or includes recycled water that contains for example about 500 to about 5000 ppm of H2S dissolved therein, a number of additional advantages may accrue. The ecologically unattractive H2S need not be vented to the atmosphere, the recycled water does not require further treatment to remove H2S and the H2S may be of assistance in reducing coking of the catalyst by passivation of the heavy metals, i.e. by conversion thereof to the sulfide form which has a lesser tendency than the free metals to enhance coke and hydrogen production. In the reaction zone, the presence of H20 can dilute the carbo metallic oil vapors, thus reducing their partial pressure and tending to increase the yield of the desired products.It has been reported that H20 is useful in combination with other materials in generating hydrogen during cracking thus it may be able to act as a hydrogen donor for hydrogen deficient carbo metallic oil feedstocks.The H20 may also serve certain purely mechanical functions such as assisting in the atomizing or dispersion of the feed competing with high molecular weight molecules for adsorption on the surface of the catalyst, thus interrupting coke formation steam distillation of vaporizable product from unvaporized feed material and disengagement of product from catalyst upon conclusion of the cracking reaction. It is particularly preferred to bring togetherH20, catalyst and carbo metallic oil substantially simultaneously. For example, one may admix H20 and feedstock in an atomizing nozzle and immediately direct the resultant spray into contact with the catalyst at the downstream end of the reaction zone.The addition of steam to the reaction zone is frequently mentioned in the literature of fluid catalytic cracking.Addition of liquid water to the feed is discussed relatively infrequently, compared to the introduction of steam directly into the reaction zone. However, in accordance with the present invention it is particularly preferred that liquid water be brought into intimate admixture with the carbo metallic oil in a weight ratio of about 0.04 to about 0.15 at or prior to the time of introduction of the oil into the reaction zone, whereby the water e.g., in the form of liquid water or in the form of steam produced by vaporization of liquid water in contact with the oil enters the reaction zone as part of the flow of feedstock which enters such zone. Although not wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the foregoing is advantageous in promoting dispersion of the feedstock.Also, the heat of vaporization of the water, which heat is absorbed from the catalyst, from the feedstock, or from both, causes the water to be a more efficient heat sink than steam alone. Preferably the weight ratio of liquid water to feed is about 0.04 to about 0.1, more preferably about 0.05 to about 0.1.Of course, the liquid water may be introduced into the process in the above described manner or in other ways, and in either event the introduction of liquid water may be accompanied by the introduction of additional amounts of water as steam into the same or different portions of the reaction zone or into the catalyst and or feedstock.For example, the amount of additional steam may be in a weight ratio relative to feed in the range of about 0.01 to about 0.25, with the weight ratio of total H20 as steam and liquid water to feedstock being about 0.3 or less. The charging weight ratio of liquid water relative to steam in such combined use of liquid water and steam may thus range from about 5 to about 0.2. Such ratio may be maintained at a predeternined level within such range or varied as necessary or desired to adjust or maintain the heat balance of the reaction.Other materials may be added to the reaction zone to perform one or more of the above described functions. For example, the dchydrogenation condensation activity of heavy metals may be inhibited by introducing hydrogen sulfide gas into the reaction zone.Hydrogen may be made available for hydrogen deficient carbo metallic oil feedstocks by introducing into the reaction zone either a conventional hydrogen donor diluent such as a heavy naphtha or relatively low molecular weight carbon hydrogen fragment contributors, including for example light paraffins low molecular weight alcohols and other compounds whic permit or favor intermolecular hydrogen transfer and compounds that chemically combine to generate hydrogen in the reaction zone such as by reaction of carbon monoxide with water, or with alcohols, or with olefins, or with other materials or mixtures of the foregoing.All of the above mentioned additional materials including water , alone or in conjunction with each other or in conjunction with other materials, such as nitrogen or other inert gases, light hydrocarbons, and others, may perform any of the above described functions for which they are suitable, including without limitation, acting as diluents to reduce feed partial pressure and or as heat sinks to absorb excess heat present in the catalyst as received from the regeneration step. The foregoing is a discussion of some of the functions which can be performed by materials other than catalyst and carbo metallic oil feedstock intro duced into the reaction zone, and it should be understood that other materials may be added or other functions per formed without departing from the spirit of the invention. The invention may be practiced in a wide variety of appara tus. However, the preferred apparatus includes means for rapidly vaporizing as much feed as possible and efficiently admixing feed and catalyst although not necessarily in that order , for causing the resultant mixture to flow as a dilute suspension in a progressive flow mode, and for separating the catalyst from cracked products and any uncracked or only partially cracked feed at the end of a predetermined residence time or times, it being preferred that all or at least a substantial portion of the product should be abruptly separated from at least a portion of the catalyst. For example, the apparatus may include, along its elongated reaction chamber, one or more points for introduction of carbo metallic feed, one or more points for introduction of catalyst, one or more points for introduction of additional material, one or more points for withdrawal of products and one or more points for withdrawal of catalyst.The means for introducing feed, catalyst and other material may range from open pipes to sophisticated jets or spray nozzles it being preferred to use means capable of breaking up the liquid feed into fine droplets. Preferably, the catalyst, liquid water when used and fresh feed are brought together in an apparatus similar to that disclosed in U. S. Patent Application Serial No. 969,601 of George D.Myers et al, filed December 14, 1978, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.According to a particularly preferred embodiment based on a suggestion which is understood to have emanated fromMr. Steven M. Kovach, the liquid water and carbo metallic oil, prior to their introduction into the riser, are caused to pass through a propeller, apertured disc, or any appropriate high shear agitating means for forming a homogenized mixture containing finely divided droplets of oil and or water with oil and or water present as a continuous phase. It is preferred that the reaction chamber, or at least the major portion thereof, be more nearly vertical than horizontal and have a length to diameter ratio of at least about 10, more preferably about 20 or 25 or more. Use of a vertical riser type reactor is preferred. If tubular, the reactor can be of uniform diameter throughout or may be provided with a continuous or step wise increase in diameter along the reaction path to maintain or vary the velocity along the flow path. In general, the charging means for catalyst and feed and the reactor configuration are such as to provide a relatively high velocity of flow and dilute suspension of catalyst. For example, the vapor or catalyst velocity in the riser will be usually at least about 25 and more typically at least about 35 feet per second. This velocity may range up to about 55 or about 75 feet per second or higher. The velocity capabilities of the reactor will in general be sufficient to prevent substantial build up of catalyst bed in the bottom or other portions of the riser, whereby the catalyst loading in the riser can be maintained below about 4 or 5 pounds and below about 2 pounds per cubic foot, respectively, at the upstream e.g. bottom and downstream e.g. top ends of the riser.The progressive flow mode involves, for example, flowing of catalyst, feed and products as a stream in a positively controlled and maintained direction established by the elongated nature of the reaction zone. This is not to suggest however that there must be strictly linear flow. As is well known, turbulent flow and slippage of catalyst may occur to some extent especially in certain ranges of vapor velocity and some catalyst loadings, although it has been reported adviseable to employ suffi ciently low catalyst loadings to restrict slippage and back mixing. Most preferably the reactor is one which abruptly separates a substantial portion or all of the vaporized cracked pro ducts from the catalyst at one or more points along the riser, and preferably separates substantially all of the vaporized cracked products from the catalyst at the down stream end of the riser. A preferred type of reactor embodies ballistic separation of catalyst and products that is, catalyst is projected in a direction established by the riser tube, and is caused to continue its motion in the general direction so established, while the products, having lesser momentum, are caused to make an abrupt change of direction, resulting in an abrupt, substantially instantaneous separation of product from catalyst.In a preferred embodiment referred to as a vented riser, the riser tube is provided with a substantially unobstructed discharge opening at its downstream end for discharge of catalyst.An exit port in the side of the tube adjacent the downstream end receives the products. The discharge opening communi cates with a catalyst flow path which extends to the usual stripper and regenerator, while the exit port communicates with a product flow path which is substantially or entirely separated from the catalyst flow path and leads to separation means for separating the products from the relatively small portion of catalyst, if any, which manages to gain entry to the product exit port. Examples of a ballistic separation apparatus and technique as above described, are found in U. S. Patents 4,066,533 and 4,070,159 to Flyers et al, the disclosures of which patents are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.According to a particularly preferred embodiment, based on a suggestion understood to have emanated from Paul W. Walters, Roger M. Benslay and Dwight F. Barger, the ballistic separation step includes at least a partial reversal of direction by the product vapors upon discharge from the riser tube that is, the product vapors make a turn or change of direction which exceeds 90 at the riser tube outlet. This may be accomplished for example by providing a cup like member surrounding the riser tube at its upper end. the ratio of cross sectional area of the cup like member relative to the cross sectional area of the riser tube outlet being low i.e. less than I and preferably less than about 0.6. Preferably the lip of the cup is slightly downstream of, or above the downstream end or top of the riser tube, and the cup is preferably concentric with the riser tube. By means of a product vapor line communic3tinµ with the interior of the cup but not the interior of the riser tube, having its inlet positioned within the cup interior in a direction upstream of the riser tube outlet, product vapors emanating from the riser tube and entering the cup by reversal of direction are transported away from the cup to catalyst and product separation equipment.Such an arrangement can produce a high degree of completion of the separation of catalyst from product vapors at the riser tube outlet, so that the required amount of auxiliary catalyst separation equipment such as cyclones is greatly reduced, with consequent large savings in capital investment and operating cost.Preferred conditions for operation of the process are described below. Among these are feed, catalyst and reaction temperatures, reaction and feed pressures, residence time and levels of conversion, coke production and coke laydown on catalyst.In conventional FCC operations with VGO, the feedstock is customarily preheated, often to temperatures significantly higher than are required to make the feed sufficiently fluid for pumping and for introduction into the reactor. For example, preheat temperatures as high as about 7000 or 8000F have been reported. But in our process as presently practiced it is preferred to restrict preheating of the feed, so that the feed is capable of absorbing a larger amount of heat from the catalyst while the catalyst raises the feed to conversion temperature, at the same time minimizing utilization of external fuels to heat the feedstock. Thus, where the nature of the feedstock permits, it may be fed at ambient temperature.Heavier stocks may be fed at preheat temperatures of up to about 600of, typically about 200 F to about 5000F, but higher preheat temperatures are not necessarily excluded.The catalyst fed to the reactor may vary widely in tem perature, for example from about 11000 to about 16000F, more preferably about 1200 to about 1500ref and most preferably about 13000 to about 14000F, ith about 13250 to about 13750 being considered optimum at present.As indicated previously, the conversion of the carbometallic oil to lower molecular weight products may be conducted at a temperature of about 9000 to about 14000F, measured at the reaction chamber outlet. The reaction temperature as measured at said outlet is more preferably maintained in the range of about 9750 to about 13O00F, still more preferably about 9850 to about 1200 OF, and most preferably about 10000 to about 1150 oF. Depending upon the temperature selected and the properties of the feed, all of the feed may or may not vaporize in the riser.Although the pressure in the reactor may, as indicated above, range from about 10 to about 50 psia, preferred and more preferred pressure ranges are about 15 to about 35 and about 20 to about 35. In general, the partial or total pressure of the feed may be in the range of about 3 to about 30, more preferably about 7 to about 25 and most preferably about 10 to about 17 psia. The feed partial pressure may be controlled or suppressed by the introduction of gaseous including vaporous materials into the reactor, such as for instance the steam, water and other additional materials described above. The process has for example been operated with the ratio of feed partial pressure relative to total pressure in the riser in the range of about 0.2 to about 0.8, more typi cally about 0.3 to about 0.7 and still more typically about 0.4 to about 0.6, with the ratio, of added gaseous material which may include recycled gases and or steam resulting from introduction of H20 to the riser in the form of steam and or liquid water relative to total pressure in the riser correspondingly ranging from about 0.8 to about 0.2, more typically about 0.7 to about 0.3 and still more typically about 0.6 to about 0.4.In the illustrative operations just described, the ratio of the partial pressure of the added gaseous material relative to the partial pressure of the feed has been in the range of about 0.25 to about 2.5, more typically about 0.4 to about 2 and still more typically about 0.7 to about 1.7.Although the residence time of feed and product vapors in the riser may be in the range of about 0.5 to about 10 seconds, as described above, preferred and more preferred values are about 0.5 to about 6 and about 1 to about 4 seconds, with about 1.5 to about 3.0 seconds currently being considered about optimum. For example, the process has been operated with a riser vapor residence time of about 2.5 seconds or less by introduction of copious amounts of gaseous materials into the riser, such amounts being sufficient to provide for example a partial pressure ratio of added gaseous materials relative to hydrocarbon feed of about 0.8 or more. By way of further illustration, the process has been operated with said residence time being about two seconds or less, with the aforesaid ratio being in the range of about 1 to about 2.The combination of low feed partial pressure, very low residence time and ballistic separation of products from catalyst are considered especially beneficial for the conversion of carbo metallic oils. Additional benefits may be obtained in the foregoing combination when there is a substantial partial pressure of added gaseous material, especially H20 as described above.Depending upon whether there is slippage between the catalyst and hydrocarbon vapors in the riser, the cata lyst riser residence time may or may not be the same as that of the vapors. Thus, the ratio of average catalyst reactor residence time versus vapor reactor residence time, i.e. slippage, may be in the range of about 1 to about 5, more preferably about 1 to about 4 and most preferably about 1.2 to about 3, with about 1.2 to about 2 currently being considered optimum.In certain types of known FCC units, there is a riser which discharges catalyst and product vapors together into an enlarged chamber, usually considered to be part of the reactor, in which the catalyst is disengaged from product and collected. Continued contact of catalyst, uncracked feed if any and cracked products in such enlarged chamber results in an overall catalyst feed contact time appreciably exceeding the riser tube residence times of the vapors and catalysts. When practicing the process of the present invention with ballistic separation of catalyst and vapors at the downstream e.g. upper extremity of the riser, such as is taught in the above mentioned Dyers et al patents, the riser residence time and the catalyst contact time are substantially the same for a major portion of the feed and product vapors.It is considered advantageous if the vapor riser residence time and vapor catalyst contact time are substantially the same for at least about 80 , more preferably at least about 90 and most preferably at least about 95 by volume of the total feed and product vapors passing through the riser. By denying such vapors continued contact with catalyst in a catalyst disengagement and collection chamber one may avoid a tendency toward re cracking and diminished selectivity.In general, the combination of catalyst to oil ratio, temperatures, pressures and residence times should be such as to effect a substantial conversion of the carbo metallic oil feedstock. It is an advantage of the process that very high levels of conversion can be attained in a single pass for example the conversion may be in excess of 50 and may range to about 90 or higher.Preferably, the aforementioned conditions are maintained at levels sufficient to maintain conversion levels in the range of about 60 to about 90t and more preferably about 70 to about S5 o. The foregoing conversion levels are calculated by subtracting from 1008 the percentage obtained by dividing the liquid volume of fresh feed into 100 times the volume of liquid product boiling at and above 430or tbp, standard atmospheric pressure .These substantial levels of conversion may and usually do result in relatively large yields of coke, such as for example about 4 to about 14 by weight based on fresh feed, more commonly about 6 to about 122 and most frequently about 6 to about 10. The coke yield can more or less quantitatively deposit upon the catalyst. At contemplated catalyst to oil ratios, the resultant coke laydown may be in excess of about 0.3, more commonly in excess of about 0.5 and very frequently in excess of about 1 of coke by weight, based on the weight of moisture free regenerated catalyst. Such coke laydown may range as high as about 25, or about 3 , or even higher. In common with conventional FCC operations on VGO, the present process includes stripping of spent catalyst after disengagement of the catalyst from product vapors. Persons skilled in the art are acquainted with appropriate stripping agents and conditions for stripping spent catalyst, but in some cases the present process may require somewhat more severe conditions than are commonly employed. This may result, for example, from the use of a oarbo metallic oil having constituents which do not volatilize under the conditions prevailing in the reactor, which constituents deposit themselves at least in part on the catalyst. Such adsorbed, unvaporized material can be troublesome from at least two standpoints.First, if the gases including vapors used to strip the catalyst can gain admission to a catalyst disengagement or collection chamber connected to the downstream end of the riser, and if there is an accumulation of catalyst in such chamber, vaporization of these unvaporized hydrocarbons in the stripper can be followed by adsorption on the bed of catalyst in the chamber. More particularly, as the catalyst in the stripper is stripped of adsorbed feed material, the resultant feed material vapors pass through the bed of catalyst accumulated in the catalyst collection and or disengagement chamber and may deposit coke and or condensed material on the catalyst in said bed.As the catalyst bearing such deposits moves from the bed and into the stripper and from thence to the regenerator, the condensed products can create a dr rand for more stripping capacity, while the coke ean tend to increase regeneration temperatures and or demand greaser regeneration capacity. For the foregoing reasons, it is preferred to prevent or restrict contact between stripping vapors and catalyst accumulations in the catalyst disengagement or collection chamber. This may be done for example by preventing such accumulations from forming, e.g. with the exception of a quantity of catalyst which essentially drops out of circulation and may remain at the bottom of the disengagement and or collection chamber, the catalyst that is in circulation may be removed from said chamber promptly upon settling to the bottom of the chamber. Also, to minimize regeneration temperatures and demand for regeneration capacity, it may be desirable to employ conditions of time, temperature and atmosphere in the stripper which are sufficient to reduce potentially volatile hydrocarbon material borne by the stripped catalyst to about 10E or less by weight of the total carbon loading on the catalyst. Such stripping may for example include reheating of the catalyst, extensive stripping with steam, the use of gases having a temperature considered higher than normal for FCC VGO operations, such as for instance flue gas from the regenerator, as well as other refinery stream gases such as hydrotreater off gas E2S containing , hydrogen and others.For example, the stripper may be operated at a temperature of about 10250F or higher.Substantial conversion of carbo metallic oils to lighter products in accordance with the invention tends to produce sufficiently large coke yields and coke laydown on catalyst to require some care in catalyst regeneration.In order to maintain adequate activity in zeolite and non zeolite catalysts, it is desirable to regenerate the catalyst under conditions of time, temperature and atmosphere sufficient to reduce the percent by weight of carbon remaining on the catalyst to about 0.25 or less, whether the catalyst bears a large heavy metals accumulation or not. Preferably this weight percentage is about 0.1 or less and more preferably about 0.058 or less, especially with zeolite catalysts. The mounts of coke which must therefore be burned off of the catalysts when processing carbo metallic oils are usually substantially greater than would be the case when cracking VGO. The term coke when used to describe the present invention, should be understood to include any residual unvaporized feed or cracking product, if any such material is present on the catalyst after stripping.Regeneration of catalyst, burning away of coke deposited on the catalyst during the conversion of the feed, may be performed at any suitable temperature in the range of about 1100 to about 1600 cm, measured at the regenerator catalyst outlet. This temperature is preferably in the range of about 12000 to about 1500cur, more preferably about 1275e to about 1425 CF and optimally about 1325e to about 1375cm. The process has been operated, for example, with a fluidized regenerator with the temperature of the catalyst dense phase in the range of about 1300C to about 1400cur. In accordance with the invention, regeneration is conducted while maintaining the catalyst in one or more fluidized beds in one or more fluidization chambers. Such fluidized bed operations are characterized, for instance, by one or more fluidized dense beds of ebulliating particles having a bed density of, for example, about 25 to about 50 pounds per cubic foot. Fluidization is maintained by passing gases, including combustion supporting gases, through the bed at a sufficient velocity to maintain the particles in a fluidized state but at a velocity which is sufficiently small to prevent substantial entrainment of particles in the gases.For example, the lineal velocity of the fluidizing gases may be in the range of about 0.2 to about 4 feet per second and preferably about 0.2 to about 3 feet per second. The average total residence time of the particles in the one or more beds is substantial. ranging for example from about 5 to about 30, more preferably about 5 to about 20 and still more preferably about 5 to about 10 minutes. From the foregoing, it may be readily seen that the fluidized bed regeneration of the present invention is readily distinguishable from the short contact, low density entrainment type regeneration which has been practiced in some FCC operations.When regenerating catalyst to very low levels of carbonoa regenerated catalyst, e.g. about 0.15 or less or about 0.05 or less, based on the weight of regenerated catalyst, it is acceptable to burn off at least about the last 10 or at least about the last 5 by weight of coke based on the total weight of coke on the catalyst immediately prior to regeneration in contact with combustion producing gases containing excess oxygen. In this connection it is contemplated that some selected portion of the coke, ranging from all of the coke down to about the last 5 or 10 by weight, can be burned with excess oxygen.By excess oxygen is meant an amount in excess of the stoichiometric requirement for burning all of the hydrogen, all of the carbon and all of the other combustible components, if any, which are present in the abovementioned selected portion of the coke immeidately prior to regeneration. The gaseous products of combustion conducted in the presence of excess oxygen will normally include an appreciable amount of free oxygen. Such free oxygen, unless removed from the by product gases or converted to some other form by a means or process other than regeneration, will normally manifest itself as free oxygen in the flue gas from the regenerator unit.In order to provide sufficient driving force to complete the combustion of the coke with excess oxygen, the amount of free oxygen will normally be not merely appreciable but substantial, i.e. there will be a concentration of at least about 2 mole percent of free oxygen in the total regeneration flue gas recovered from the entire, completed regeneration operation.While such technique is effective in attaining the desired low levels of carbon on regenerated catalyst, it has its limitations and difficulties as will become apparent from the discussion below.Heat released by combustion of coke in the regenerator is absorbed by the catalyst and can be readily retained thereby until the regenerated catalyst is brought into contact with fresh feed. When processing carbo metallic oils to the relatively high levels of conversion involved in the present einvention, the amount of regenerator heat which is trans mitted to fresh feed by way of recycling regenerated catalyst can substantially exceed the level of heat input which is appropriate in the riser for heating and vaporizing the feed and other materials, for supplying the endothermic heat of reaction for cracking, for making up the heat losses of the unit and so forth. Thus, in accordance with the invention, the amount of regenerator heat transmitted to fresh feed may be controlled, or restricted where necessary, within certain approximate ranges.The amount of heat so trans itted may for exam ple be in the range of about 500 to about 1200, more particularly about 600 to about 900, and more particularly about 650 to about 850 3TUs per pound of fresh feed.The aforesaid ranges refer to the combined heat, in BvUs per pound of fresh feed, which is transmitted by the catalyst to the feed and reaction products between the contacting of feed with catalyst and the separation of product from catalyst for supplying the heat of reaction e.g. for cracking and the difference in enthalpy between the products and the fresh feed. Not included in the foregoing are the heat made available in the reactor by the adsorption of coke on the catalyst, nor the heat consumed by heating, vaporizing or reacting recycle streams and such added materials as water, steam naphta and other hydrogen donors, flue gases and inert gases, or by ratio tion and other losses. One or a combination of techniques may be utilized in this invention for controlling or restricting the amount of regeneration heat transmitted via catalyst to fresh feed.For example, one may add a combustion promotor to the cracking catalyst in order to reduce the temperature of combustion of coke to carbon dioxide and or carbon monoxide in the regenerator. Moreover, one may remove heat from the catalyst through heat exchange means, including for example heat exchangers e.g. steam coils built into the regenerator itself, whereby one may extract heat from the catalyst during regeneration. Heat exchangers can be built into catalyst transfer lines, such as for instance the catalyst return line from the regenerator to the reactor, whereby heat may be removed from the catalyst after it is regenerated.The amour.t of heat imparted to the catalyst in the regenerator may be restricted by reducing the amount of insulation on the regenerator to permit some heat loss to the surrounding atmosphere, especially if feeds of exceedingly high coking potential are planned for processing in general, such loss of heat to the atmosphere is considered economically less desirable than certain of the other alternatives set forth herein. One may also inject cooling fluids into portions of the regenrator other than those occupied by the dense bed, for example water and or steam, whereby the amount of inert gas available in the regenerator for heat absorption and removal is increase.Another suitable and preferred technique for controlling or restricting the heat transmitted to fresh feed via recycled regenerated catalyst involves maintaining a specified ratio between the carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide formed in the regenerator while such gases are in heat exchange contact or relationship with catalyst undergoing regeneration. In general, all or a major portion by weight of the coke present on the catalyst inrnediately prior to regeneration is removed in at least one combustion zone in which the aforesaid ratio is controlled as described below.More particularly, at least the major portion more preferably at least about 65 and more preferably at least about 80 by weight of the coke on the catalyst is removed in a combustion zone in which the molar ratio of CO2 to CO is maintained at a level substantially below 5, e.g. about 4 or less. Look ing at the CO2 CO relationship from the inverse standpoint, it is preferred that the CO CO2 molar ratio should be at least about 0.25 and preferably at least about 0.3 and still more preferably about 1 or more or even 1.5 or more.While persons skilled in the art are aware of techniques for inhibiting the burning of CO to CO2, it has been suggested that the mole ratio of CO CO2 should be kept less than 0.2 when regenerating catalyst with large heavy metal accumulations resulting from the processing of carbo metallic oils, in this connection see for example U.S. Patent 4,162,213 toZrinscak, Sr. et al. In this invention, however, maximizingCO production while regenerating catalyst to about 0.1 car bon or less, and preferably about 0,05 carbon or less, is a partcularly preferred embodiment of this invention.Moreover, according to a preferred method of carrying out the invention the sub process of regeneration, as a whole, may be carried out to the above mentioned low levels of carbon on reynerated catalyst with a deficiency of oxygen more specifically, the total oxvaen supplied to the one or more stages of regeneration can be and preferably is less then the stoichiometric amount which would be reouired to burn all hydrogen in the coke to H2O and to burn all carbon in the coke to CO2 If the coke includes other combustibles, the aforementioned stoichiometric amount can be adjusted to in clud the amount of oxygen required to burn them.Still another particularly preferred technique for controlling or restricting the regeneration heat imnarted to fresh feed via recycled catalyst involves the diversion of a portion of the heat borne by recycled catalyst to added materi als introduced into the reactor, such as the water, storm, napht . a, other hydrogen donors, flue gases, inert gases, and other gaseous or vaporizable materials which may be intro duzod into the reactor.Tne larger the amount of coke which must be burned from a given weight of catalyst, the greater the potential for exposing the catalyst to excessive temperatures. Many otherwise desirable and useful cracking catalysts are particularly susceptible to deactivation at high temperatures, and among these are quite a few of the costly molecular sieve or zeolite types of catalyst. The crystal structures of zeolites and the pore structures of the catalyst carriers generally are somewhat susceptible to thermal and or hydrothermal degradation. The use of such catalysts in catalytic conversion processes for carbo metallic feeds creates a need for regeneration techniques which will not destroy the catalyst by exposure to highly severe temperatures and steaming.Such need can be met by a multi stage regeneration process which includes conveying spent catalyst into a first regeneration zone and introducing oxidizing gas thereto. The anount of oxidizing gas that enters said first zone and the concentration of oxygen or oxygen bearing gas therein are sufficient for only partially effecting the desired conversion of coke on the catalyst to carbon oxide gases. The partiallv regenerated catalyst is then removed from the first regeneration zone and is conveyed to a second regeneration zone. Oxidizinq gas is introduced into the second regeneration zone to provide a higher concentration of oxygen or o.rrgen containing gas than in the first zone, to complete the removal of carbon to the desired level. The regenerated catalyst may then be removed from the second zone and recycled to the reactor for contact with fresh feed. An example of such multi stage regeneration process is described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 969,602 of Gorge D.dyers et al, filed December 14, 1978, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.Another example may be found in U.S. Patent 2,938,739. Multi stage regeneration offers the possibility of combining o ygen deficient regeneration with the control of the Co Co2 molar ratio. Thus, about 50 or more, more prefer ably about 65 to about 95, and more preferably about 80 to about 958 by weight of the coke on the catalyst immediately prior to regeneration may be removed in one or more stages of regeneration in which the molar ratio of CO CO2 is controlled in the manner described above.In combination with the foregoing, the last 5t or more, or 10 or more by weight of the coke originally Dresent, up to the entire amount of coke remaining after the preceding stage or stages, can be removed in a subsequent stage of regeneration in which more oxygen is present. Such process is susceptible of operation in such a manner that the total flue gas recovered from the entire, completed regeneration operation contains little or no excess oxygen, i.e. on the order of about 0.2 mole percent or less, or as low as about 0.1 mole percent or less, which is substantially less than the 2 mole percent which has been suggested elsewhere.Thus, multi stage re generation is particularly beneficial in that it provides another ccnvenient technique for restricting regeneration heat trans itted to fresh feed via regenerated catalyst and or reducing the potential for thermal deactivation, while sinultaneously affording an opportunity to reduce the carton level on regenerated catalyst to those very low percentages e.g. about 0.1t or less which particularly enhance catalyst acti itj. Moreover, where the regeneration conditions, e.g. tenperature or atmosphere, are substantially less severe in the second zone than in the first zone e.g. by at least about 10 and preferably at least about 20eF , that part of the regeneration sequence which involves the most severe con editions is performed while there is still an appreciable amount of coke on the catalyst. Such operation may provide sori protection of the catalyst from the more severe condi ticks A particularly preferred embodiment of the invention is t c stage fluidized regeneration at a maximum temperature of about 1500 CF with a reduced temperature of at least about 10 or 20oF in the dense phase of the second stage as compared to the dense phase of the first stage, and with re duction of carbon on catalyst to about 0.05t or less or even about 0.025 or less by weight in the second zone. In fact, catalyst can readily be regenerated to carbon levels as low as 0.01B by this technique, even though the carbon on catalyst prior to regeneration is as much as about 1 .In most circumstances, it will be important to insure that no adsorbed oxygen containing gases are carried into the riser by recycled catalyst. Thus, whenever such action is considered necessary, the catalyst discharged from the regenerator may be stripped with appropriate stripping gases to remove oxygen containing gases. Such stripping may for instance be conducted at relatively high temperatures, for example about 1350 to about 1370 cm, using steam, nitrogen or other inert gas as the stripping oas es . The use of nitrogen and other inert gases is beneficial from the standpoint of avoiding a tendency toward hydro thermal catalyst deac tivation which may result from the use of steam.The following comments and discussion relating to metals management, carbon management and heat management maY be of assistance in obtaining best results when operating the invention. Since these remarks are for the most part directed to what is considered the best mode of operation, it should be apparent that the invention is not limited to the particular modes of operation discussed below. Moreover, since certain of these comments are necessarily based on theoretical considerations, there is no intention to be bound by any such theory, whether expressed herein or implicit in the opera ting suggestions set forth hereinafter.Although discussed separately below. it is readily apparent that metals management, carbon management and heat mane ment are inter related and interdependent subjects both in theory and practice. While coke yield and co latdotNTn on catalyst are primarily the result of the relatively large quantities of coke precursors found in carbo metallic oils, the production of coke is exacerbated by high metals accumulations, which can also significantly affect catalyst per fornance. Moreover, the degree of success experienced in metals management and carbon management will have a direct influence on the extent to which heat management is neces sary Moreover, some of the steps taken in support of metals management have proved very helpful in respect to carbon and heat management.As noted previously the presence of a large heavy metals ac accumulation on the catalyst tends to aggravate the problem of dehydrogenation and aromatic condensation, resulting in increased production of gases and coke for a feedstock of a given Ramsbottom carbon value. The introduction of substantial quantities of H20 iEto the reactor, either in the fo of steam or liquid water, appears highly beneficial from the standpoint of keeping the heavy metals in a less harmful form, i.e. the oxide rather than metallic form. This is of assistance in maintaining the desired selectivity. Also, a unit design in which system components and residence times are selected to reduce the ratio of catalyst reactor residence time relative to catalyst regenerator residence time will tend to reduce the ratio of the tines during which the catalyst is respectively under reduction conditions and oxidation conditions. This too can assist in maintaining desired levels of selectivity. Whether the metals content of the catalyst is being managed successfully mav be observed by monitoring the total hydro gen plus methane produced in the reactor and or the ratio of hvdrogen to methane thus produced. In general, it is considered that the hydrogen to methane mole ratio should be les than about 1 and preferably about 0.6 or less, with about 0.4 or less being considered about optimum Careful carbon management can improve both selectivity the ability to maximizc production of valuable products , and heat productivity. In general, the techniques of metals control described above are also of assistance in carbon management.The usefulness of water addition in respect to carbon management has already been spelled out in considerable detail in that part of the specification which relates to added materials for introduction into the reaction zone. Ih general, those techniques which improve dispersion of the feed in the reaction zone should also prove helpful, these include for instance the use of fogging or misting devices to assist in dispersing the feed.Catalyst to oil ratio is also a factor in heat management.In common with prior FCC practice on VGO, the reactor tem perature may be controlled in the practice of the present invention by respectively increasing or decreasing the flow of hot regenerated catalyst to the reactor in response to decreases and increases in reactor temperature, typicallY the outlet temperature in the case of a riser type reactor. Where the automatic controller for catalyst introduction is set to maintain an excessive catalyst to oil ratio, one can expect unnecessarily large rates of carbon production and heat release, relative to the weight of fresh feed charged to the reaction zone.Relatively high reactor temperatures are also beneficial from the standpoint of carbon management. Such higher temperatures foster more complete vaporization of feed and disengagement of product from catalyst.Carbon management can also be facilitated by suitable re striction of the total pressure in the reactor and the partial pressure of the feed. In general, at a given level of conversion, relatively small decreases in the aforementioned pressures can substantially reduce coke production. This may be due to the fact that restricting total pressure tends to enhance vaporization of high boiling components of the feed, encourage cracking and facilitate disengagement of both unconverted feed and higher boiling cracked products from the catalyst. It may be of assistance in this regard to restrict the pressure drop of equipment downstream of and in communi cation with the reactor.But if it is desired or necessary to operate the system at higher total pressure, such as for instance because of operating limitations e.g. pressure drop in downstream equipment the above described benefits may be obtained by restricting the feed partial pressure. Suitable ranges for total reactor pressure and feed partial pressure have been set forth above, and in general it is desirable to attempt to minimize the pressures within these ranges.The abrupt separation of catalyst from product vapors and unconverted feed if any is also of great assistance. It is for this reason that the so called vented riser apparatus and technique disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,070,159 and 4,066,533 to George D. Myers et al is the preferred type of apparatus for conducting this process. For similar reasons, it is beneficial to reduce insofar as possible the elapsed tine between separation of catalyst from product vapors and the commencement of stripping.The vented riser and prompt stripping tend to reduce the opportunity for coking of unconverted feed and higher boiling cracked products adsorbed on the catalystA particularly desirable mode of operation from the stand point of carbon management is to operate the process in the vented riser using a hydrogen donor if necessary, while maintaining the feed partial pressure and total reactor pressure as low as possible, and incorporating relatively large amounts oE water, steam and if desired, other diluents, which provide the numerous benefits discussed in greater detail above.Moreover, when liquid water, steam, hydrogen donors, hydrogen and other gaseous or vaporizable materials are fed to the reaction zone, the feeding of these materials provides an opportunity for exercising additional control over catalyst to oil ratio. Thus, for example, the practice of increasing or decreasing the catalyst to oil ratio for a given amount of decrease or increase in reactor temperature may be reduced or eliminated by substituting either bppro priate reduction or increase in the charging ratios of the water, steam and other gaseous or vaporizable material, or an appropriate reduction or increase in the ratio of water to steam and or other gaseous materials introduced into the reaction zone.Heat management includes measures taken to control the amount of heat released in various parts of the process and or for dealing successfully with such heat as may be released. Un like conventional FCC practice using VGO. wherein it is usually a problem to generate sufficient heat during regeneration to heat balance the reactor, the processing of carbometallic oils generally produces so much heat as to require careful management thereof.Heat management can be facilitated by various techniques associated with the materials introduced into the reactor. Thus, heat absorption by feed can be maximized by minimum preheating of feed, it being necessary only that the feed temperature be high enough so that it is sufficiently fluid for successful pumping and dispersion in the reactor. When the catalyst is maintained in a highly active state with the suppression of coking metals control , so as to achieve higher conversion, the resultant higher conversion and greater selectivity can increase the heat absorption of the reaction. In general, higher reactor temoeratures promote catalyst conversion activity in the face of more refractory and higher boiling constituerts with high coking potentials. zxnile the rate of catalyst deactivation may thus be in croased, the higher temperature of operation tends to offset this loss in activity. Higher temperatures in the reactor also contribute to enhancement of octane number, thus offsetting the octane depressant effect of high carbon lav down.Other techniques for absorbing heat have also been discussed above in connection with the introduction of water, steam, and other gaseous or vaporizable materials into the reactor.Another technique employed in heat management is careful stripping. The severe stripping techniques referred to above are useful in controlling the amount of heat released in the regenerator. Each or any combination of the aforemen tioned techniques of metals management, carbon management and heat management may be practiced in conjunction with the introduction of liquid water into the regeneration bed in accordance with the present invention.As noted above, the invention can be practised in the abovedescribed mode and in many others. An illustrative, nonlimiting example is described by the accompanying schematic diagrams in the figure and by the description of this figure which follows.Referring in detail to the drawing, petroleum feedstock is introduced into the lower end of riser reactor 2 through inlet line 1, at which point it is mixed with hot regenerated catalyst coming through line 5 and stripper 14 from regenerator 9.The feedstock is catalytically cracked in passing up riser 2 and the product vapors are separated from catalyst particles in vessel 3 and are removed through line 4. The catalyst, contaminated with coke, is passed into stripper 19 through line 7 and is introduced into bed 23 in upper zone 10 of regenerated 9 through line 36. The rate of flow of catalyst into zone 10 is controlled by valve 8. Fresh catalyst and powdered MgC12 are introduced through lines 30 and 31 into solids feeder 33 and then through line 32. Oxidizing gas, such as air, is introduced into zone 10 through line 21. A portion of the coke on the catalyst is burned in zone 10, the MgC12 is converted to MgO and a chlorine component, and the partially regenerated catalyst, coated with MgO flows downwardly through conduit 18 into lower regeneration zone 25.An oxidizing gas, such as air, is introduced into regeneration zone 25 through line 11. The oxidizing gas flows through gas distribution plate 15 and thus into the bed 16 of catalyst particles. This mixture passes upwardly through the bed 16 of coke contaminated catalyst particles, fluidizing it as well as reacting with the coke, and passes through perforated plate 17 into the bed of catalyst particles in zone 10.The perforations in the plate 17 are large enough so that the upwardly flowing gas readily passes therethrough into zone 10. During regeneration of the catalyst the pressure difference between the upper and lower zones prevents catalyst particles from passing downwardly through the plate. Gases within the regenerator comprising combustion products, nitrogen, and chlorine, are separated from suspended catalyst particles by a separator not shown and then pass out of the regenerator through line 24.Regenerated catalyst is removed from zone 25 through conduit 26 for return to riser 2 through the stripper 14, the rate of removal being controlled by valve 6.A stripping gas such as steam is introduced into stripper 19 through line 20 to remove volatiles from the catalyst.The volatiles pass from the stripper through line 7 into vessel 3 and then out through line 4. Similarly a stripping gas, such as steam is introduced into stripper 14 through line 12 to remove absorbed nitrogen from the regenerated catalyst before it is returned to the reactor 2. The stripped gases pass through line 26 into the regenerator 9.While this invention may be used with single stage regenerators, or with multiple stage regenerators having cocurrent instead of countercurrent flow, it is especially useful in a regenerator of the type shown which is well suited for producing gases having a high ratio of CO to CO2.In a preferred method of carrying out this invention in a countercurrent flow pattern as in the apparatus in theFigure, the amount of oxidizing gas and catalyst are controlled so that the amount of oxidizing gas passing into zone 25 is greater than that required to convert all the coke on the catalyst in this zone to carbon dioxide, and the amount of oxidizing gas passing upwardly from zone 25 into zone 10 together with the oxidizing gas added to zone 10 from line 21 is insufficient to convert all the coke in zone 10 to carbon dioxide. Zone 10 therefore will contain some CO, and MgC12 added to this zone, or added to a portion of the system where C12 formed will pass into this zone, will reduce the tendency of CO to oxidize to CO2.Other portions of the system to which MgC12 may be added to provideC12 for retarding the oxidization of CO to CO2 include the stripper 14, line 26, bed 16, in the dilute phase above bed 16 and in line 36.Having thus described this invention, the following Examples are offered to illustrate the invention in more detail. Example IA carbo metallic feed at a temperature of about 450 CF is introduced at a rate of about 2070 pounds per hour into the bottom zone of a vented riser reactor where it is mixed with steam, water and a zeolite catalyst at a temperature of about 12750F. The catalyst to oil ratio by weight is 11.3 to 1.The carbo metallic feed has a heavy metal content of about 5 parts per million nickel equivalents, a sulfur content of about one percent and a Conradson carbon content of about 7 percent. About 85 percent of the feed boils above 650 F and about 20 of the feed boils above l0250F. The water and steam are injected into the riser at a rate of about 103 and 240 pounds per hour respectively. The temperature within the reactor is about 10000F and the pressure is about 27 psia. The partial pressure of feed and steam are about 11 psia and 16 psia respectively.Within the riser about 75 percent of the feed is converted to fractions boiling at a temperature less than 4300F and about 53 percent of the feed is converted to gasoline. During the conversion 11.2 percent of the feed is converted to coke containing 5.3 percent hydrogen. The catalyst containing about one percent by weight of coke and about 0.01 percent sulfur is removed from the reactor and introduced into a stripper where it is contacted with steam at a temperature of about 10000F to remove volatiles adsorbed onto the catalyst. The stripped catalyst is introduced into the upper zone of a two zone regenerator as shown in the Figure at a rate of 23,000 pounds per hour. Each zone contains about 4000 pounds of catalyst. Air is introduced into the lower zone at a rate of about 1400 pounds per hour. The lower zone produces 85 pounds of CO2 per hour and no measurable amount of CO, and is at a temperature of about 1340 F. Air is introduced into the upper zone at a rate of about 1200 pounds per hour together with flue gases from the lower zone. The upper zone produces 540 pounds of CO2 per hour and 112 pounds of CO per hour, and it is at a temperature of about 13300F. The regenerator flue gases contain 3400 ppm sulfur oxides and CO2 and CO in a mol ratio of 3.6. The catalyst removed from the lower zone is recycled to the reactor riser contains about 0.03 percent coke by weight. ExamPle IIThe process conditions of Example I are followed except that powdered MgC12 is added to the catalyst in the upper zone of the regenerator at a rate of ten pounds per hour until the concentration of MgO on the catalyst reaches about four percent. The rate of addition of MgC12 is then reduced to about 0.5 pound per hour to replace the MgO with the catalyst fines. The flue gas contains about 1700 ppm sulfur, about 130 ppm Cl2, and the CO to CO2 ratio is about 2 5.The foregoing examples are offered to illustrate this invention and it is obvious that changes may be made in the process without departing from the invention.
