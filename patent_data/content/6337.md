# Recovery of hydrogen fluoride from metallic fluoride salts.

## Abstract
Anhydrous hydrogen fluoride of high purity is recover ed from metallic fluoride salts containing phosphate va lues by digesting the metallic salts in an aqueous solution in a humid atmosphere at a sufficiently high temperature to release a gas containing hydrogen fluoride and a negli gible amount of P₂O₅. The released gas is rectified in a rectification operation which includes a rectification zone 34 in which the rectification occurs in the presence of sul phuric acid.
