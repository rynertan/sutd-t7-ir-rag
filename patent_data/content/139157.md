# Apparatus for growing single crystals of dissociative compounds.

## Abstract
An apparatus for pulling single crystals of dissociative compounds, with a volatile component gas sealed in a growth chamber at a controlled pressure thereof, is dis closed, wherein the chamber is made of one or more materials selected from the group consisting of ceramics, gas tight carbon, heat resistant metallic materials, ceramic coated carbon and ceramic coated heat resistant metallic materials, the chamber 1,2 can be divided, with a structure of the divided portion of the chamber capable of being sealed by making use of a sealing material 7 with a pressure exerted on the seal, and an optical window 9 is disposed in the chamber through which the growing state of the crystal 6 in the chamber can be observed.
