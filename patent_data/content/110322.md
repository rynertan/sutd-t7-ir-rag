## Description
IMPROVED FILLER POLYMER COMPOSITESTECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates generally to polymeric matrices incorporating inorganic fillers therein, e.g., in molding compounds. More particularly, this invention relates to filler polymer systems suitable for use as substrates for printed circuit boards, hybrid integrated circuits or other related uses in the electronics industry.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Organic and inorganic fillers are often added to polymers to enhance the physical, mechanical or electrical properties of the polymer and or to reduce the cost of the product. Poor adhesion between the filler particles and the polymer resin, however, often results in a decrease in mechanical strength of the composite. This is particularly true when attempting to obtain a composite having a high filler to matrix resin ratio. Consequently, a method for obtaining filler polymer composites, especially with high filler loading, which will not fail mechanically due to lack of adhesion between the filler particles and the resin matrix is desirable. Recently, L. Graham discovered, as set forth inU.S. Patent No. 4,362,783 issued December 7, 1982, that the adhesion between a substrate, e.g., a metal sheet, and a polymeric coating thereon could be enhanced by treating the substrate with a wetting hydrosol and a coupling agent.The present invention is a discovery that the technology set forth in Graham can be used to provide improved fillerpolymer composites.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An improved filler polymer composite article comprises a polymeric matrix containing particulate filler material wherein the filler has been treated prior to incorporation in the polymer matrix so as to provide an adherent wetting hydrosol layer over the surface of the filler particles toqether with a coupling agent which contains moieties which are compatible with the hydrosol and the polymeric resin with which the filler is to be mixed. The method of forming such articles is also included herein.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a composite of three photomicrographs a , b and c selected to illustrate interfacial failure I , cohesive failure C and an intermediate failure mode C I and FIG. 2 is composite of four photomicroraphs of the fracture surfaces of a glass bead filler in a silicone polymeric matrix showing both SNS treated and untreated, wet and dry factures.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In general the invention involves the formation of a novel article comprising a filler polymeric resin composite wherein the filler particles are precoated with a layer of a wetting hydrosol and a coupling agent thereover to enhance the adhesion of the filler to the polymer matrix. The filler material is typically an inorganic material such as an inorganic oxide or silicate or may be a metallic or other elemental material. Examples of typical inorqanic fillers include glasses, silica, alumina, borosilicates, silicon, copper, talc, kaolin, mica and the like. However, orqanic fillers, e. g., Kevlar commat , a polyamide made by E. I. DuPont may also be employed. The fillers, while usually used in the form of a powder, may also be provided as crystallites or fiber. While in theory there is no limitation upon the particular polymeric matrix material employed in the composite, provided the coupling atent is compatible with it as set forth herein, typical polymer matrices which have been employed include epoxy resins, silicone resins, polystyrenes and polyimides. A detailed discussion of wetting hyrosols suitable for use in accordance with this invention as well as their manufacture can be found with reference to a patent issued to J. T. Kenney, U.S. Patent No. 3,657,003. The preferred method for preparing the composite articles is as follows. The desired wetting hydrosol is prepared in accordance with the teachings in Kenney. The filler is added to the hydrosol and the mixture is stirred for several minutes at room temperature. The mixture is then filtered and the filler is washed with water until the filtrate is colorless. The wet filler is then added to a 1 weight percent aqueous solution of the coupling agent and the mixture is stirred for several minutes. The filler which then has a thin layer of hydrosol over its surface and a layer of coupling agent over the hydrosol is collected by filtration and dried, e.g., at about 1200C, for about 8 20 hours.The treated filler is then dispersed in the resin in one of two ways a For resin systems which must be cured i.e., uncured monomer, oligomer or prepolymer , the filler is added to the liquid resin systm heating if necessary to make the system liquid and stirred for about 1 2 hour.The curing agent is then added and the mixture stirred briefly. The mixture is then cast or otherwise processed into the desired form and cured or b For systems which do not require curing i.e., previously cured resin the resin is dissolved in a suitable solvent to form a viscous solution. The filler is added to the resin solution and the mixture is stirred for about 1 2 hour to evently disperse the filler in the resin.The mixture is then cast or otherwise processed in the desired form and the solvent is allowed to evaporate. The composite is then baked at about 20 C above the boiling point of the solvent for about 8 20 hours to drive off excess solvent. It was discovered that for the best results nonpolar or low polarity solvents are preferred. Also, it is preferred to wash the hydrosol treated filler particles prior to further treatment so as to leave essentially a monomolecular layer of the hydrosol on the surface of the filler. Further, on the systems investigated, amine containing coupling agents are generally preferred. In order to determine the relative mechanical strength of filler polymer composites, various composites were made using treated as well as untreated filler materials. Also, tests were run for comparison using fillers pretreated by prior art techniques. The various samples were tested by fracturing them under tension and then examining the fracture surface by means of scanning electron microscopy SEM to determine the polymer to filler adhesion upon fracture.Fracture tests were performed wet and dry. Wet tests were performed by first immersing the sample in water at 70 C for 24 hours and fracturinq while wet. The tests results are noted based upon the predominant locus of failure as determined by the SEM study C indicating a locus cohesive within the resin matrix I indicating an interfacial locus and C I indicating both failure mechanisms observed with 508 interfacial fracture. On occasion observations were such that the locus of fracture was something less than cohesive wherein a C C I was demarked or where the locus was somewhat more cohesive than pure interfacial wherein I C I was demarked. The best adhesion between filler and matrix, of course, being indicated by a cohesive locus of fracture and the least adhesion by an interfacial locus of fracture.

As can be seen from FIG. 1 a and the untreated beads of FIG. 2, an interfacial failure or bond I is one showing little or no adhesion of the polymer matrix to the filler particles as evidenced by the clean surface of the particles and the separation of the particle surface from the surrounding polymer. In contrast to this is the cohesive failure or bond C depicted in FIG. 1 b and theSNS treated glass beads of FIG. 2 which shows good adhesion between the polymer matrix and the filler particles as evidenced by the polymer coated surface of the filler particles and absence of separation of the particle surface from the polymer. Intermediate to these failures is the failure designated C I which shows in FIG. 1 c adhesion of polymer to only a portion of the fibrous filler particles. It is to be understood that the above described embodiments are simply illustrative of the principles of the invention. Various other modifications and changes may be devised by those skilled in the art which will embody the principles of the invention and all within the spirit and scope thereof.
