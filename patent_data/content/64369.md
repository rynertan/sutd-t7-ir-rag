# A device for automatically and continuously measuring the constituent parts of blood.

## Abstract
At the time of drawing the blood continuously from the vein of a patient by means of a catheter 11 and measuring the concentration of a specified constituent part contained in the blood automatically and continuously for long hours, the sample liquid and two sorts of correcting liquids standard liquid I 21 and base liquid 22 are sucked by a single sampling nozzle 31 in prescribed order and are supplied to the measuring section 5 through a common channel 32 . Each of the liquids are diluted with a buffer solution 41 at the identical rate with the manifold in the measuring section, are separated from one another through the interposition of air layers among them, and supplied to a sensor 52 . The outputs of the measured sample liquid from the sensor are corrected by the outputs of each of the neighboring mea sured correcting liquids in succession and are displayed as measured values. In the blood drawing section 1 , there is used a double current catheter having the first and second catheter arrangements which are constructed so as to be incorporated directly into the tube pump P₁, P₂ .
