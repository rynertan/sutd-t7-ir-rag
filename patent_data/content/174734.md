# OIL PUMPS

## Abstract
A gear pump has a variable output which is relatively ripple free by using a single common gear rotor meshed with a pair of individual annuli each mounted in a corresponding eccentric so that they can be turned in opposite directions. This not only reduces the output from each rotor part, by reducing the eccentricity, but puts the parts out of phase with one another. According to the invention the rings are journalled by needle roller bearings which avoids them jamming due to the forces involved within the pump.
