# A numerical control system having a machine tool and a robot.

## Abstract
A numerical control system has a numerical control device 1 and a machine tool 2 and a robot 3 controlled by the device 1 . The numerical control device 1 has a memory 102 in which machine tool command data and robot command data can both be stored. A non volatile external memory 5 is provided into which command data from the memory 102 can be transferred. A pulse distributing circuit 104 for effecting pulse distributing for control is employed for controlling both the machine tool 2 and the robot 3 , the output of the pulse distributing circuit 104 being switched over from machine tool 2 to robot 3 by a switching control circuit 109 .
