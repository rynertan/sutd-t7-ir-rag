# Bleaching compositions.

## Abstract
Thickened bleach compositions contain hypochlorite mixed with an organic thickening component which com prises one or more amine oxides with one or more deliberately added amines. Particularly preferred amine oxides are those having 13 to 15 carbon atoms in the long chain and the preferred amines are those corresponding to the amine oxide used.
