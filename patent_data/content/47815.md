## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to materials for capacitors that is, grain boundary layer dielectric ceramic compositions in which diffusing agents mainly consisting of Bi 0 and Cu20 are thermally diffused into 23 the grain boundaries of a semiconductive ceramic mainly consisting of SrTiO3 or the solid solution of Srl Ca TiO3 so that the dielectric layers are formed in the grain boundaries. The grain boundary layer dielectric ceramic compositions which are used for the manufacture of capacitors comprise a semiconductive ceramic composition and a diffusing composition which renders the grain boundaries of the semiconductive ceramic composition to have a high resistance and which forms the dielectric layers in the grain boundaries. The characteristics of capacitors, therefore, are dependent upon the selection of the semiconductive ceramic compositions and the diffusing compositions. The semiconductive ceramic compositions in accordance with the present invention mainly consist ofSrTio3 containing Nb2O5 or of the solid solution of Sr1 xCa TiO3 containing Nb20 5. The semiconductive ceramic compositions consisting of SrTiO3 containing Nb2O5 are well known in the art as disclosed in Japanese Laid OpenPatent ApplieFtion Nos. 129896 1974 and 8099 1975 but as the diffusing agents or eompositions whieh.are diffused ino the grain boundaries of such semiconductive ceramic compositions so as to form the dielectric layers, only 3i203 as disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent Application No. 129896 1974 and the compositions consisting of Nb 205 and ZnO as disclosed in Japanese Laid OpenPatent Application No. 8099 1975 are known. The grain boundary diffusing agents used in the present invention are characterized by consisting of Bi2O3 and Cu2O Bi2O3Cu2O, MnO2 and B2O3 or Bi2O3, Cu2O and MnO2.A grain boundary diffusing agent consisting of By203, Cu2O and 2 is disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent ApplicationNo. 78494 1979 and used in the production of semiconductive ceramic compounds of strontium titanate containing manganese oxide and niobium oxide or their solid solutions.Such semiconductive ceramic compounds are different from those in accordance with the present invention. A four component system boundary grain diffusing agent consisting of Bi2O, Cu20, MnO2 and Li20 is also disclosed in JapaneseLaid Open Patent Application No. 111698 1979 and used in the production of semiconductive ceramic compounds of strontium titanate containing bismuth oxide and niobium oxide. Such ceramic compounds are also different from those of the present invention. Based on the variations in electrostatic capacitance due to temperature variations, grain boundary layer dielectric ceramic capacitor elements are rated asYD, YB and Y . That is, the capacitor elements which have the temperature coefficient of capacitance of 20 between 850 C and 250C based on the capacitance at 200 C are rated as YD. Those which have the temperature coefficient of are are rated as YB and those which have the temperature coefficient of 5 are rated as YA. Regardless of their ratings, all the capacitor elements preferably have a high dielectric constant fas a high dielectric breakdown voltage Vb and a low dielectric loss tan 8 .In practice, the YD rated capacitor elements must have the dielectric constant e of higher than 35,000, the dielectric break a down voltage Vb of higher than 500 V mm and the dielectric loss tan 8 of less than 0.01. The YB rated capacitor elements must have the dielectric constant a of higher than 20,000, the dielectric breakdown voltage Vb of higher than 700 V mm and the dielectric loss tan 8 of less than 0.01. The YA rated capacitor elements must have the dielectric constant E of higher than 5000, the dielectric a breakdown voltage Vb of higher than 700 V mm and the dielectric loss tan 8 of less than 0.01.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The grain boundary layer dielectric ceramic capacitors in accordance with the present invention can satisfy all the characteristics required in practice.The semiconductive ceramic compositions which are especially recommended for the fabrication of YD rated ceramic capacitor elements consist of from 50.23 to 49.47 mo l of SrO,jfrom 49.72 to 50.23 mol of TiO2 and from 0.05 to 0.3 mol of Nub 205 or mainly consist of the above described constituents and contains less than 0.2 mol parts of SiO2 based on 100 mol parts of the main constituents. The semiconductive ceramic compositions for YB rated ceramic capacitor elements consist of from 50.23 to 34.47 molt of SrO and equal to or less than 14.8 mol ofCato, the contents of the constituents SrO and CaO being from 50.23 to 49.47 mol , from 49.72 to 50.23 mol ofTiO2 and from 0.05 to 0.3 mol of Nb2O5 or mainly consist of the above described constituents.The semiconductive ceramic compositions for YA rated capacitor elements consist of from 35.43 to 26.87 mol of SrO, from 14.8 to 22.6 mol of CaO, the contents of the constituents SrO and CaQ being from 50.23 to 49.47 mol , from 49.72 to 50.23 mol of TiO2 and from 0.05 to 0.3 mol of Nb205, or mainly consist of the above described constituents and further contain less than 2 mol parts of SiO2 based on 100 mol parts of the main constituents. The semiconductive ceramic compositions in accordance with the present invention for YD, YB and YA rated capacitor elements contain from 0.05 to 0.3 mol of Nb2O5. Nb205 is the constituent needed, based upon the principle of the valence control, to render SrTiO3 consisting of SrO and TiO2 or the solid solution of Srl Ca TiO3 consisting of SrO, CaO and TiO2 semiconductive.However, when the contents of Nb2O5 is less than 0.05 mol about 0.02 mol based on the contents of SrTiO3 orSr1 xCaxTiO3 , sufficient semiconductive properties cannot be attained in SrTiO3 or the solid solution of Sr1 xCaxTiO3.On the other hand, when Nb205 exceeds 0.3 mol about O 6 mol based on the contents of SrTiO3 or Sr1 xCaxTiO3 , the grain growth of SrTiO3 or Sr1 xCaxTiO3 is inhibited.In addition, the semiconductive ceramic compositions will have a high specific resistance. Thus, the addition ofNb205 in excess of 0.3 mol is, not preferable. When theSrO constituent is substituted by the CaO constituent inSrTiO3 which is the main constituent of semiconductive ceramic, the temperature coefficient of capacitance will be decreased with increase in contents of the CaO constituent and the grain sizes are in general reduced after sintering. When the CaO constituent exceeds 22.6 mol this corresponds almost to Sr0.55Ca0.45TiO3 the grain size after sintering becomes less than 5 m so that a minimum apparent dielectric constant e of 5000 cannot be a attained. When the combined contents of SrO and CaO exceeds 50.23 mol or when the Ti02 constituent is less than 49.72 mol , the grain size after sintering will become small, so that a minimum apparent dielectric constant b a of 5000 cannot be attained. Furthermore, when the contents of SrO and CaO is less than 49.47 mol or when TiO2 exceeds 50.23 mol , the grain size will become small, so that a minimum apparent dielectric constant e of 5000 cannot be a attained. The reason is that when the SrO, CaO and TiO2 constituents are present in excess of certain contents inSrTiO3 or Sr1 xCaxTio3, the grain growth is inhibited during sintebihg. The SiO2 constituent has the effect of not only facilitating the semiconductive ceramic of SrTiO3 or Srl xCaxTiO3 so that the main sintering temperatures can be lowered but also slightly lowering the dielectric loss tan a. However, when the SiO2 constituent exceeds 2 mol parts based on 100 mol parts of the main composition consisting of three or four constituents of SrO, CaO,TiO2 and Nb2O5, the grain growth is considerably inhibited, so that the average grain size of greater than 5 m cannot be obtained. That is, a minimum apparent dielectric constant 5a of 5000 cannot be attained. The grain boundary diffusing agents in accordance with the present invention are characterized by consisting of main two component systems consisting of 90 14.3 molc,c of Bi203 and 10 85.7 mol of Cu20 four component systems in which the main two component systems are partially substituted by less than 4 mol of MnO2 and less than 6 mols of B203 or five component systems in which the four component systems are partially substituted by less than 20 mols of Li20. The results of experiments conducted by the inventors show that when the contents of the Bi2O3 constituent is high. in the grain boundaries after thermal diffusion, the dielectric constant Sa becomes high, but the dielectric breakdown voltage Vb becomes low and the temperature coefficient of capacitance between 850C and 250C becomes high.On the other hand, when the Cu2O constituent is increased, the temperature coefficient of capacitance becomes low, the dielectric breakdown voltage V becomes high and the dielectric constant S becomes low. b a The Bi2O3 constituent in excess of 90 mol or the Cu2O constituent less than 10 mol is not preferable because a minimum dielectric breakdown voltage Vb of 500 V mm cannot be attained. Furthermore, the Cu20 constituent in excess of 85.7 mol,C or the Bi 203 constituent less than 14.3 mol is not preferable because the dielectric constant of higher than 5000 cannot be obtained. This minimum dielectric constant cannot be attained even when semiconductive ceramic has a relatively large average grain size of greater than about 20 m. The addition of the MnO2 constituent results in the increase ih dielectric breakdown voltage Vb, the slight decrease in dielectric constant a and the increase in dielectric loss tan 9. It is preferable that the contents of the MnO2 constituent is less than 4 molt because when the MnO2 constituent exceeds 4 mol the dielectric loss tan 8 of less than 0.01 cannot be obtained. The addition of B2O3 to the Bi2O3 Cu2O diffusing agents or compounds to the Bi2O3 Cu2O MnO2 systems results in the decrease in tan 8, but is accompanied with the undesired decrease in Vb. When B2O3 exceeds 6 mol ,Vb higher than 500 V mm cannot be attained. It is, therefore, preferable that the content of B2O3 be less than 6 mol . The addition of Li O to the two threeand four component systems results in the increase in E a without causing the increase in the temperature coefficient of capacitance, but when the content exceeds 20 mol ,Vb decreases while tan 8 increases. Especially becauseVb of higher than 500 V mm cannot be attained, the content higher than 20 mols is not preferable. As described above, the grain boundary layer dielectric ceramic compositions in accordance with the present invention can completely satisfy the YD, YB and YA requirements. For instance, the present invention provides a YD rated capacitor element which has the temperature coefficient of capacitance of less than 20 , the dielectric constant E of between 40,000 and 60,000, a the dielectric breakdown voltage Vb of between 600 and 1300 and the dielectric loss tan 8 of between 0.003 and 0.005.The present invention can also provide a YB rated capacitor element which has the temperature coeffi cient of capacitance of less than 10 , the dielectric constant e of between 20,000 and 35,000, the dielectric a breakdown voltage Vb of between 1,000 and 2,000 V mm, and the dielectric loss tan 8 of between 0.003 and 0.005. The present invention can further provide a YA rated capacitor element which has the temperature coefficient of capacitance of less than 5 , the dielectric constant S of between 7,000 and 20,000, the dielectric breakdown a voltage Vb of between 2,000 and 4,000 V mm and the dielectric loss tan 8 of between 0.003 and 0.005. Next some examples will be described. EXAMPLE 1 SrCO3 powder the purity of higher than 97.5 , CaCO3 powder the purity of higher than 98 , TiO2 anatase type, the purity of higher than 98.5 and Nb205 powder the purity of higher than 98 , all of which are for industrial use and available in the market , were proportioned as shown in TABLE 1 and mixed by a wet mixing process. After being dried, the semiconductive ceramic compositions were calcined at 12000C and then crushed into the powder with the average grain size of 2.5 Fm. An aqueous solution of polyvinyl alcohol was added as a binder. After being passed through a sieve of 32 mesh, the compositions were pressed under the pressure of about one ton cm into disks 15 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in thickness. The disks were heat treated in the air at 10000C and then sintered at 1,3900C for four hours in the flow of the gas mixture consisting of 95 of N2 and 5 of H2, whereby the semiconductive ceramic disks about 12.5 mm in diameter and about 0.4 mm in thickness we re obtained. The disk was then fractured and the fractured surface was polished and etched for observation through a microscope so as to measure the grain size.The results were shown also in TABLE 1. Even when the sintering temperature was varied between 1,380 and l,40O0C, the average grain size remained unchanged.

Except the specimen Nos. 11 and 171, the specific resistance measured at 20 0C with the In Ga electrodes was between 0.2 and 0.5 ohm.cm. SpecimenNos. 11 and 171 showed high specific resistance of 3.5 and 8.5 ohmcm, respectively, which means that the valance controlled semiconductive properties are not sufficient. The grain growth of specimen Nos. 44, 114 and 204 whose Nb2O5 contents were in excess of 0.30 mol was inhibited, so that the average grain size was small and less than 5 m. Further, the grain growth of the specimen No. 13 whose SrO content was in excess of 50.23 mol , the specimen Nos. 35 and 105 whose SrO and TiO2 contents were less than 49.47 mol , the specimen Nos. 13, 21 and 91 whose TiO2 content was less than 49.72 mol , the specimenNos. 35, 98 and 105 whose TiO2 content was in excess of 50.23 mols was inhibited, so that the average grain size was small and less than 5 m. The fact that the CaO contents in excess of 22.6 mol is not preferable was proved by the specimenNo. 264 whose grain size was less than 5 clam. Except the specimen Nos. 13, 21, 28, 35, 44, 91, 98, 105, 114, 171, 204 and 254, the average grain sizes were greater than 5 pm. The semiconductive ceramic disks which had the average sizes greater than 12 m were applied with a diffusing agent or composition in the paste form and were subjected to the heat treatment at 11900C for two hdurs, so that the dielectric layers were formed in the grain boundaries. In like manner, the semiconductor ceramic specimens which had the average grain size of less than 12 m were applied with a diffusing agent or composition in the form of paste and were subjected to the heat treatment at 1050 c for two hours, so that the dielectric layers were formed in the grain boundaries. The diffusing agent or composition used was a five constituent composition consisting of 54.6 mol of Bi2O3, 29.4 mol of Cu2O, 1.0 mol of MnO2, 2.5 mol of B2O3 and 12.5 mol of Li2CO3.These constituénts are all available in the market and of the special grade for tests. 1.2 mg of the diffusing agent or composition paste was applied to each specimen of 250 mg.Care was taken during thermal diffusion so that the diffusing agent or composition would not leave from the specimens by evaporation or diffusion. On both major surfaces of the grain boundary layer dielectric ceramic disks, Ag electrodes were formed by a pyrolytic process, whereby the capacitor elements were provided. The dielectric constant a and the dielectric loss tan were measured both at 1 kHz. The results were shown in TABLE 2.

The effect of theSiO2 constituent for facilitating the sintering is clear from Specimen Nos. 8521, 8522 and 8523. That is, even when the sintering temperature was lowered from 13900C to 13500C, the average grain size remained almost unchanged.Specimen Nos. 8541, 8542 and 8543 containing 1 mol part of SiO2 and Specimen Nos. 8831 and 8832 containing 0.5 mol parts of SiO2 showed the same tendency.

In like manner, the specimens whose average grain size was less than 12 Am were applied with the diffusing pastes and heat treated at 10500C for two hours.
