# Cutting off disc.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a cutting off disc having in its free, operative side face at least one recess and at least one bore adjoining said recess for accomodating in countersunk position a member for fastening the disc to a driving shaft. A disadvantage of the known disc is that due to the very high speeds in cutting off and to the relatively large dimen sions of the disc the centrifugal forces in the disc may be come very high. As a result of the dish shaped central part 7 the force occurring may be so heavy that the disc may exhi bit certain elastic deformations, whilst there is furthermore the risk that the disc has to absorb forces in a direction in which it is not sufficiently capable of doing so, which results in rupture. This means a necessary replacement of an ex pensive disc. The novel technique proposes to avoid the abovemen tioned disadvantages by providing a cutting off disc of the kind set forth in the preamble, which has the shape of a flat disc.

## Claims
CLAIM A cutting off disc having in the free, operative side face at least one recess with at least one adjoining bore for receiving, in countersun, position, a member for fastening the disc to a driving shaft characterized in that the cutting off disc is constructed in the form of a flat disc.

## Description
Short title Cutting off disc. The inventionrelates to a cutting off disc having in its free, operative side face at least one recess and at least one bore adjoining said recess for accommodating in countersunk position a member for fastening the disc to a driving shaft. Such a cutting off disc is known. Fig. 1 shows a known cutting off disc 1. The operative front face thereof is quite smooth over an important part. In the middle is provided a recess 3 with an adjoining central bore 4 so thata bolt 5 can pass through the central bore 4 and the head 6 of the bolt does not project in front of the operative front face 2 of the disc 1. The cutting off disc 1 has a shape such that it has a dish shaped central part 7. A disadvantage of this known design is that the known cutting off disc requires a special method of manufacture so that it is relatively expensive. A further disadvantage of the known disc is that due to the very high speeds in cutting off and to the relatively large dimensions of the disc the centrifugal forces in the disc may become very high. As a result of the dish shaped central part 7 the force occurring may be so heavy that the disc may exhibit certain elastic deformations, whilst there is furthermore the risk that the disc has to absorb forces in a direction in which it is not sufficiently capable of doing so, which results in rupture. This means a necessary replacement of an expensive disc, whilst the rupture of a disc may be extremely hazardous to the staff and may cause damage to material and machinery The novel technique proposes to avoid the abovementioned disadvantages by providing a cutting off disc of the kind set forth in the preamble, which has the shape of a flat disc. The invention will be described more fully with reference to the drawing of some arbitrary embodiments. The drawing shows in Fig. 1 a known cutting off disc in a fragmentary side view, Fig. 2 a fragmentary side elevation of a cuttingoff disc of the type proposed and Fig. 3 a detail of a second embodiment. Fig. 1 shows a known cutting off disc having a dish shaped central part as described above. Fig. 2 shows a new type of cutting off disc 8 having a plurality of recesses 10 opening out in the operative front face 9 and adjoining bores 11 for receiving in countersunk position as shown a screw 12 having a head 13, which head does not project in front of the operative front face 9. As will be apparent from Fig. 2 the bores 11 serve to pass the shanks of the screws 12, which co operate with a stretching flange 14 arranged at the end of a driving shaft 15. Fig. 3 shows a cutting off disc 16 connected with a clamping flange 17 by using bolts 18 screwed tight by means of nut 22 to the clamping flange 17, the bolts having heads 20 countersunk in recesses 19. With respect to the recesses 19 the heads 20 have a size such that they do not project in front of the front face 23 of the cutting off disc 16.
