# Method and apparatus for testing the setting of a valve.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for testing the setting of a valve particularly a safety valve mounted on a vessel 1 compris ing a valve member 4 biassed towards a valve seat 6 . employs a pulling device 12, 13, 14 which is engaged with the valve member 4 and operated to apply a tractive force opposed to the bias which is just sufficient to separate the valve member 4 from the valve seat 6 . The pulling device 12, 13, 14 is preferably operated by a hydraulic or pneumatic pump 19 . The hydraulic or pneumatic pressure which is just sufficient to separate the valve member 4 from the valve seat 6 is indicated by a suitable gauge 21 and is proportional to the tractive force. The sum of the tractive force and the force acting on the valve from inside the vessel 1 and which can be calculated from the internal pressure indicated on a pressure gauge 2 communicating with the interior of the vessel 1 is indicative of the setting of the valve. The separation of the valve member 4 from the valve seat 6 is conveniently indi cated by bubbles in a layer 22 of liquid overlying the valve member 4 .
