# Process and apparatus for the exchange of emission sources.

## Abstract
Apparatus for the exchange of emission sources of a particle accelerator located in an accelerator vessel filled with a gaseous insulating medium, comprising a gastight source exchange chamber 3 which is connected by means of a line 26 that can be closed by an exchange valve 8 to the accelerator vessel 17 , the said chamber 3 being provided on the inside with a movable exchange member 4 and 5, respectively having at least one hole 41 and 51, respectively and at least two holders 43, 44 and 53, 54, respectively for the emission sources 6a, 6b to be exchanged, one or more lead through rods 1 for the transfer of an emission source from the accelerator vessel 17 to the exchange chamber 3 or from the exchange chamber 3 to the accelerator vessel 17 , as well as means for placing the movable exchange member 4 and 5, respectively in the desired position relative to the exchange valve 8 .
