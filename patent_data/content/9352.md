# Sealing of ceramic and cermet parts, sealing material therefor and ceramic seal obtained.

## Abstract
The invention provides a particulate sealing material for use in preparing hermetic seals between ceramic and cermet members, which material comprises at least 70 wt. refractory oxide and minor quantities of non vitreous ad ditive comprising SiO₂, MgO and B₂O₃. This particulate sealing material is conveniently pressed into the form of a coherent element shaped to suit the particular sealing op eration concerned, e.g. the sealing of an open end of a ceramic arc tube to a cermet closure therefor. The inven tion also provides a method of sealing a ceramic compo nent to a cermet member by interposing said sealing mate rial between the opposed faces of the component and member and applying heat and pressure to sinter the seal ing material and achieve a seal between the component and member.
