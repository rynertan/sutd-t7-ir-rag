## Description
This invention relates to a method for the production of semiconductor devices which minimizes undesirable phenomenon such as a non uniform segregation of Te at the the interface when a p n junction or a heterojunction is formed in semiconductors derived from Group III V compounds containing Te. Liquid phase epitaxy of semiconductors formed from Group III V compounds is widely used as a conventional production method for semiconductor lasers and light emitting diodes, see for instance U.S. Patent 4479222. When such devices are produced, Te is often used as an n impurity. This makes it possible to obtain a crystal of high electron density with relative ease, and the process can be controlled readily. However, there is a lamellar distribution of areas on the surface of the layer in which Te is used as an impurity where the density of Te is extremely high. In this case, when additional crystals are being grown continuously, undesirable effects often occur with certain characteristics of the devices, such as a decrease in the uniformity of the crystal grown on the said surface of the crystal and an increase at the interface in the recombination center. For example, Figure 3 shows a wafer which is produced as follows On a p GaAs substrate 31, a Te doped AlGaAs current blocking layer 10¹⁹ cm ³ 32 having a thickness of 0.7 µm and a non Te doped GaAs surface protective layer 33 having a thickness of 0.1 µm are grown by liquid phase epitaxy. When the thin semiconductor layer 33 is grown on the layer 32 containing Te in a high concentration, the morphology of the crystal surface is lamellar, as shown in Figure 4. It has also been found that the non Te doped GaAs surface protective layer 33 does not grow as is shown by the hatched areas in Figure 4. The lamellar growth of this thin layer 33 originates in the non uniform segregation of Te on the surface of the underlying AlGaAs current blocking layer 32. The form of the Te segregation affects the shape of the lamellae. Partial growth of the surface protective layer 33 means that the AlGaAs current blocking layer 32 containing Al on the surface thereof causes a partial exposure to air. When this wafer is used as a substrate for subsequent crystal growth, growth is not possible in this area, resulting in a major problem. Next, problems that arise when this method is used in the production of semiconductor laser devices will be discussed. Figure 5 is a sectional view of a common semiconductor laser device of double heterostructure. On an n GaAs substrate 51, a Te doped n Al In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for the production of a semiconductor device using liquid phase epitaxy of semiconductors of the AlGaAs GaAs systems, in which between a Te doped AlGaAs first layer and a second layer selected from one of said systems of a conductivity type different from that of the first layer, there is grown a non Te doped third layer selected from one of said systems of the same conductivity type as that of the first layer, whereby a p n junction is formed between the second layer and the third layer. In accordance with another respect of the invention, there is provided a method for the production of a semiconductor device using liquid phase epitaxy of semiconductors of the AlGaAs GaAs systems, in which between a Te doped AlGaAs first layer and a second layer selected from one of said systems of a crystal composition different from that of the first layer, there is grown a non Te doped third layer of the same crystal composition as that of the first layer, whereby a heterojunction is formed between the second layer and the third layer. Thus, the invention described herein makes possible the object of providing a method for the production of semiconductor devices which minimizes undesirable effects on the device characteristics caused by the non uniform segregation of Te at the interface when a p n junction or when a heterojunction is formed in Te doped semiconductor layers, so that devices can be produced with an excellent reproducibility.
