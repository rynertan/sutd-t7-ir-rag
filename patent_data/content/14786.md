## Description
FIRE EXTINGUISHER This invention relates to a fire extinguisher which automatically ejects a fire extinguishing material there from, and more particularly to a fire extinguishing material which may prevent the spread of the fire and provide a barrier when a fire occurs by automatically ejecting fire extinguishing material in every direction. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Hitherto, there have been proposed many fire extinguishing agents and extinguishing means which automatically extinguish fires. However, such fire extinguishers tend to be complicated to handle, of poor reliability in automatic operation and of complicated structure requiring various control means. In addition, the fire extinguishing agent used is sometimes harmful to human beings and animals and stains furniture and the clothes of persons involved in fire fighting. SUIs5ARY OF THE IN VENTION It is a first object of the present invention to provide a relatively simple form of fire extinguisher which may be used to scatter a fire extinguishing material in all directions to extinguish the fire. It is a second object of the present invention to provide a fire extinguishing material which is not harmful nor stains clothes of persons involved in a fire fighting operation, and yet provides a strong fire extinguishing action or force. It is a third object of the present invention to provide a relatively simple fire extinguisher which operates with a two or more stage action. According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a fire extinguisher comprising a container that is so designed as to be broken into pieces , when exposed to heat at a given temperature below 100 Q, whereby the container is broken due to the heat produced at the initial stage of the fire, under an increased internal pressure therein, so a fire extinguishing material in the container may be scattered around in every direction for extinguishing the fire. According to a second aspect of the pre sent invention, there is provided a fire extinguishing material in which three ingredients such as disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium sulfate and sodium bicarbonate are included and prior art ingredients such as ammonium sulfide and ammonium chloride are replaced by ammonium carbonate, so that there are produced gases which are not harmful to persons involved in the fire fighting and animals therearound and which do noç stain clothes of these persons. According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a fire extinguisher which may be suspended in a space, wherein the fire is anticipated, and which includes a metallic container having may holes in its bottom wall. These holes are closed with plugs of two or more kinds, the plugs of one kind having a relatively low melting point or fire point, and plugs of another kind having a relatively high melting point or fire point, whereby fire extinguishing material in the container is ejected through those holes closed by the plugs having a relatively low melting point when such plugs melt, to extinguish the fire in an initial stage, and the fire extinguishing material is ejected through those holes closed by the plugs having a relatively high melting point or fire point when such plugs melt, to extinguish flames having a strong force. The plugs are melted due to the heat of the fire and blown off due to internal pressure build up in the container.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIFENTS A fire extinguishing material as used in the present invention preferably contains, in weight percent, the following ingredients Ingredient percentage S object of use burnt alum 2.0 fire protection water glass 3.0 II disodium hydrogen 2.0 II phosphate sodium sulfate 3.0 ammonium carbonate 8.0 increasing pressure fire protection sodium bicarbonate 12.0 water 70.0 increasing pressure, fire protection. The ammonium carbonate in the fire extinguishing material decomposes, when heated to a temperature of 600 to 2000C as follows EMI4.1 tb NH4 2CO3 SEP SEP NH4 OCO.NH2 SEP SEP SEP H2O SEP ..... SEP I tb NH4.OCO.NH2 SEP CO2 2NH3 SEP ............ SEP 11 SEP tb CO2 and NH3 gases produced afford an air shielding action and fire protecting action, thus serving for the initial fire extinguishing purposes. As the ambient temperature increases sodium bicarbonate keeps producing CO2 gas according to the following equations.EMI4.2 tb NaHCO3 SEP SEP H2O NaOH SEP SEP H2CO3 SEP ........... III SEP tb H2CO3 CO SEP 2 SEP SEP CO2 SEP SEP H2O SEP ............... IV SEP tb BEen the temperature exceeds 200 C, steam is produced vigorously, thereby increasing an internal pressure within a container and increasing the force with which the fire extinguishing material isejected from the container. The above fire extinguishing material is packed in a container which is adapted to be broken into pieces when heated at a given temperature below 100 C. When the container is heated to 600 to 700, C02 and NH3 gases are produced according to the equations I to IV , thus increasing an internal pressure in the container. The internal pressure is also increased as the water vapor pressure increases, thus increasing the volume of the container to break same into pieces. As a result, the fire extinguishing mna l is scattered in every direction. CO2 and NH3 gases thus participate in fire extinguishing, while the water glass and burnt alum produced alumina silicate base compounds which give the desired viscosity.Thus, the alumina silicate compound gives a fire protective film to cover unburnt substances over a wide area and protect same against catching fire. In other words, a covering function of viscous chemicals, and the fire extinguishing and fire protective functions of CO2 and NH3 gases may be achieved at the same time. Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, the fire extinguisher comprises a tempered glass container 1 which is adapted to be broken into pieces, instantaneously when heated to o a given temperature below 100 C. The container 1 is cylindrical and of circular cross section although any desired shape may be employed. A fire extinguishing material 2 is sealed in the container 1. Caps 4 and 5 are fitted on axially opposite end portions of the container 1, with spaces left between inner ends of the caps and the ends of the container, in which spaces cushioning pads 3 are provided. Elushroom shaped projections 6 and 7 are provided at the axially opposite external ends of the caps 4 and 5.A square U shaped mounting member 10 with holes 9 in its base for receiving screws 8 which are used for receiving screws 8 which are used for attaching the member 10 to a ceiling 13 Fig. 3A or side wall 14 Fig. 3B of a room. The U shaped member 10 is further provided with grooves 11 and 12, in the limbs thereof, the grooves 11 and 12 open onto side edges of the limbs. The projections 6 and 7 are engaged in the grooves 11 and 12 so that the container 1 can be detachably supported by the member 10 in a horizontal position spaced from the wall 14 Fig. 3B or from the ceiling 3A . In either case, the grooves 11 and 12 slant upwardly towards the openings thereof. The fire extinguisher can be thus mounted in a room in which there is a risk of a fire starting .In the event of a fire, the container 1 is heated by the flames until it is automatically broken or it, may be manually thrown by hand at the fire source,As a result, the fire extinguishing material 2 is scattered in all direction tD eAingush te fire ii the manner deswibi esXpr Referring now to Figs. 4 and 5, the fire extinguisher comprises a container 1 , which is of rectangular box shape although it may be of any shape such as rectangular, square, circular cross section., The fire extinguishing material 2 is packed in the container 1 which may be suspended from a ceiling 18 as by supports 17 as shown in Fig. 4 or may be directly secured thereto. The container 1 may be made of brass, steel or stainless steel for example.Provided in the undersurface of the container l are a suitable number of holes 15 of any suitable size. These holes 15 are plugged with plugs 16 of at least two kinds having melting points or fire points of 600 to 2000C. In this embodiment, each hole 15 is provided with a stepped cylindrical wall of circular cross section rather than being formed merely by punching the material of the container 1 The walls may project either outwardy as shown in Fig.5 or inwardly of the bottom surface and or the sides of the container 1 by 0.5 to 5mm. Materials which may be used for the plugs 16 are sulfur melting point, 1140C , guttapercha melting point, 600 to 700C , Woodts metal melting point, 730C , Rose s metal mewing point, 110 C and tin melting point, 2000C i.e., a material having a melting point or fire point ranging from 600 to 2000C. The holes 15 are plugged with the plugs 16 made of suitable material having regard to the positioning and diameters of the holes 15 being taken into consideration. In the event of fire, when the container 1 is heated to a temperature of 600 to 2000C, the plugs 16 are melted or burnt so that some of the holes 15 are opened, whereupon CO2 and NH3gases carbonate contained in the fire extinguishing material produces C02 and formed from the ammonium carbonate according to the equations I and II cause the fire material to be ejected from the holes 15 in every direction. Thus, the fire at the initial stage may be extinguished by the air shelding function of gases and fire protective functions of chemicals.As the ambient temperature increases sodium bicarbonate keeps producing C02 gas according to equations III and IY above, and when the temperature exceeds 200 C, water is vaporized to produce steam at a high pressure, thus aiding in the forcing of extinguishing material through these holes 15. In the case where the ambient temperature is relatively low at the initial stage of the fire, only those plugs 16 having a relatively low melting point or fire point are melted or burnt, so that only those holes 15 which are plugged with these plugs are opened for allowing the ejection of the fire extinguishing material in a specific direction or at a source of the fire. If the fire still takes a hold and the ambient temperature rises still further the holes 15 which are plugged with plugs 16 having a relatively high melting point or fire point are opened thereby allowing the jetting of the fire extinguishing material at a high pressure in every direction. In this manner, the opening o. the holes may be suitably timed to suit the anticipated fire conditions. Thus, it is possible that for specific holes are directed towards a limited space, or a source of the fire for providing for the initial extinguishing, while the other holes are directed in every direction, when the force of flames is increased or becomes strong. The amount of fire extinguishing material used is generally about one liter per 27 cubic metres of space.
