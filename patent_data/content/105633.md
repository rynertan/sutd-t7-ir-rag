# Calcined silicas and their use in beer clarification.

## Abstract
Calcined silica gels have been prepared and found to have improved properties for clarification of beers to prevent or reduce haze formation. The calcined silica gels are defined in terms of their physical properties and also in respect of the surface silanol groupings in terms of the infra red spectrum peaks.
