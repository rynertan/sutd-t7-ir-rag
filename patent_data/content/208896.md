# Apparatus for controlling toner replenishment in electrographic copier.

## Abstract
Apparatus for controlling the replenishment of toner in an electrographic reproduction apparatus includes means 30 for monitoring toner concentration in an electrographic developer mix, and means 42 for monitoring the rate of toner depletion from such mix in developing electrostatic images. The outputs of such monitoring means are alge braically summed 70 to provide a control signal 40 for controlling toner replenishment 38 .
