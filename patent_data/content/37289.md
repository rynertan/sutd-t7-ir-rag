# Method of preparing a vinca dimer.

## Abstract
A process for preparing vincristine comprises oxidizing a solution of vinblastine sulfate at a temperature in the range from 20 C to 40 C with an acidic ferrous salt hydrogen peroxide oxidizing mixture, making the reaction mixture strongly basic, extracting therefrom the vincristine thus produced.
