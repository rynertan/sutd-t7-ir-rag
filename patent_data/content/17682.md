# METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR GEOPHYSICAL INDUCTION SURVEYING

## Abstract
The present invention relates to an inductive electro magnetic investigative method and is used for determining the presence of constituent mixtures of metallic composi tions in a body The moethod comprises the steps of creat ing at least one electromagnetic field inductively coupling the body to be investigated with the field for exciting the body to produce current flow in any such mixtures which by virtue of their inherent non linear circuit characteristics, give rise to secondary electromagnetic field effects which are non linear with respect to the created field. Investigat ing any secondary electromagnetic field created by the excitation of the body for the presence of any such non linear secondary electromagnetic field effects, to determine such mixtures are present indivative of the nature of the body.
