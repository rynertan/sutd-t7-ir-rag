## Description
This invention relates to the preparation of aryl carbonyl compounds, and in particular to para substituted aryl carbonyl compounds. Aryl carbonyl compounds are useful in the preparation of poly arylene ether ketones . In the preparation of these polymers it is essential that the monomers used be in a highly pure state to prevent undesirable side reactions. Furthermore, the polymers obtained should be stable enough to survive extrusion without undue deleterious effects on their physical properties. The substitution pattern of the monomers used can control the properties of the polymers synthesised, and it is generally recognised that the highest melting points and glass rubber transition temperatures are obtained with all para linked polymers. Mixtures of substitution isomers are used when polymers of reduced crystallinity or lowered Tg are required, but the all para substituted polymers are most preferred. When mixtures of monomers are used, known ratios of the different isomers are needed, necessitating the use of pure starting materials. The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of aryl carbonyl compounds that improves outstandingly the degree of purity of the product and or the degree of para substitution. Aryl carbonyl compounds are also useful as chemicals and chemical intermediates, for example, in the pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals, dyestuffs and general chemical additives area. Here too it is frequently found that the all para substituted carbonyl compounds are the most useful. Avoidance of concurrent formation of other isomeric by products in the synthesis of such compounds is always beneficial economically and in some instances is essential because some isomeric compounds which are different to remove have been found to be toxic or even carcinogenic. A known method of producing aryl carbonyl compounds by Friedel Crafts condensation using a Lewis acid catalyst is described in GB A 2103604. In accordance with the present invention, the Friedel Crafts condensation of appropriate reactants is controlled to suppress side reaction including alkylation and or ortho acylation by the addition of a controlling agent, such as a Lewis base, to the reaction medium. Thus the invention provides a process for the preparation of a para substituted aromatic carbonyl compound which is not an oligomer or polymer, by a Friedel Crafts condensation of 1 an aromatic compound containing at least one activated hydrogen atom with 2 phosgene or an acyl compound in the presence of 3 a Lewis acid, characterised in that any aromatic ring which contains an activated hydrogen atom also contains less than 2 alkoxy groups, and the condensation is controlled by the addition of at least 0.1 equivalents of Lewis base per equivalent of acid, ester of acid halide groups in the reactants, plus an additional equivalent of Lewis acid per equivalent of Lewis base. One aspect of this invention provides a process for the preparation of an aromatic carbonyl compound having the formula Pendant substitutents which can be present on B or Ar groups include, for example, lower alkyl, cyano, halogen, nitro, benzoyl or any other atom or group which will not interfere with the reaction by virtue of either its chemical nature or its location in the reactant from which the B group is derived. The term activated hydrogen atom refers to a hydrogen atom displaceable under the electrophilic Friedel Crafts reaction conditions employed in the reaction. Aromatic compounds suitable for acylation according to the process of the instant invention exhibit carbon 13 nuclear magnetic resonance C 13 NMR chemical shifts at the ring site where acylation is desired at least 2.1, preferably at least 2.4 and most preferably at least 2.8 parts per million ppm less than that exhibited by benzene. For a listing of C 13 NMR chemical shifts of monosubstituted benzenes see M. Mishima et al Memoirs of the Faculty of Science, Kyusuu Un., Ser. C, Vol. 11 No. 1, 1978 . Table 2 of this reference lists C 13 NMR chemical shifts of a variety of mono substituted benzenes measured in solution in carbon tetrachloride. Benzene in this solvent is stated to have a chemical shift of 128.04 ppm. The aromatic compounds useful in the instant invention may, but preferably do not, form additional complexes with Lewis acid under the reaction conditions. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that when an addition complex is formed, it should not substantially deactivate the molecule to acylation. Thus such complexes, for example, should still exhibit C 13 NMR chemical shifts which are at least 2.1 ppm less than that of benzene or sufficient uncomplexed aromatic compound is present to enable the reaction to proceed at the desired rate. Illustrative aromatic compounds of the general formulas Illustrative mono or di acyl compounds of the general formula wherein each V is independently as defined above, a is 0, 1 or 2 and Z is as defined above. Preferred acylating agents are phosgene, and acyl compounds such as 4 fluorobenzoic acid or acid halide, iso or tere phthalic acid or acid halide, naphthalene 2,6 dicarboxylic acid or acid chloride and benzophenone 4,4 dicarboxylic acid or acid chloride. Preferred combinations of substituted aromatic compounds and acyl compounds are fluorobenzene or diplenyl ether with 4 fluorobenzoyl chloride, ethyl 4 fluorobenzoate, acetyl chloride, acetic anhydride, iso or tere phthaloyl chloride, 4 hydroxybenzoyl chloride and 4 4 hydroxyphenoxy benzoyl chloride. In carrying out the process of this invention, equivalent amounts of the substituted aromatic compound and the aromatic acyl compound are preferably employed, although it may be advantageous in certain circumstances to use up to about a molar excess of one reactant. The term Lewis acid is used herein to refer to a substance which can accept an unshared electron pair from another molecule. Lewis acids which can be used in the practice of this invention include, for example, aluminium trichloride, aluminium tribromide, antimony pentachloride, antimony pentafluoride, indium trichloride, gallium trichloride, boron trichloride, boron trifluoride, zinc chloride, ferric chloride, stannic chloride, titanium tetrachloride, and molybdenum pentachloride. The use of substantially anhydrous aluminium trichloride as the Lewis acid is preferred. The amount of Lewis acid used in the practice of this invention varies depending on the particular starting materials and reaction medium selected. In all instances where the Lewis acid forms a complex with carbonyl groups or other organic species in the reactants forming a complex with Lewis acid hereinafter called other basic species irreversibly under the reaction conditions, at least about one equivalent of Lewis acid per equivalent of carbonyl groups or other basic species present in the starting materials is used plus an amount effective to act as a catalyst for the acylation. Generally the catalytic amount added is from about 0.05 to about 0.3 equivalents of Lewis acid per equivalent of acid, ester or acid halide in the reaction mixture. As is well known to those skilled in the art, acids, esters and many acid anhydrides react with an excess of Lewis acids such as aluminium trichloride to yield the corresponding acid halide which then serves as the actual acylating agent. As indicated above, the Friedel Crafts acylation reaction is controlled by the addition of a Lewis base controlling agent to achieve the desired compound substantially free of isomeric by products. The term Lewis base is used herein to refer to a substance capable of donating an unshared electron pair to a Lewis acid. Thus, the Lewis base forms a complex with the Lewis acid used in the reaction medium. It has been found that Lewis bases which form a 1 1 complex having a heat of association at least about that of diphenyl ether with the Lewis acid are preferred. For example, where aluminium trichloride is the Lewis acid the Lewis base used should form a 1 1 complex having a heat of association of at least about 15 kcal mole, preferably at least about 30 kcal mole. While the heats of association are for a 1 1 Lewis acid Lewis base complex consisting solely of these two components, the actual complex formed in the reaction medium need not be a 1 1 complex. A discussion on heats of association for Lewis acid Lewis base complexes is found in J. Chem. Soc. A , 1971, pages 3132 3135 D.E.H. Jones et al . The Lewis base used should not be an acylating, alkylating or arylating agent nor should it be acylatable under the reaction conditions. Mixtures of two or more Lewis bases can be used if desired. The Lewis base used as a controlling agent in the practice of this invention is an additional component added to the reaction medium. This does not include basic species formed in situ during the acylation. When a Lewis base is used as a controlling agent, an additional amount of Lewis acid, generally about one equivalent per equivalent of Lewis base, is used. When aluminium chloride is used as the Lewis acid one equivalent is considered to be AlCl₃. Typical Lewis bases which can be employed include, for example, amides, amines, esters, ethers, ketones, nitriles, nitro compounds, phosphines, oxides, phosphoramides, sulfides, sulfones, sulfonamides, sulfoxides and halide salts. Examples of specific organic Lewis bases that can be used in the practice of this invention are acetone, benzophenone, cyclohexanone, methyl acetate, ethylene carbonate, N methylformamide, acetamide, N,N dimethylacetamide, N methylpyrrolidone, urea, tetramethylurea, N acetylmorpholine, dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N dimethylformamide, diphenyl sulfone, dimethyl sulfone, N,N dimethylmethane sulfonamide, phosphoryl chloride, phenylphosphonyl chloride, pyridine N oxide, triphenylphosphine oxide, trioctylphosphine oxide, nitropropane, nitrobenzene, benzonitrile, n butyronitrile, methyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl sulfide, trimethylamine, N,N,N ,N tetramethylethylenediamine, N,Ndimethyldodecylamine, imidazole, pyridine, quinoline, isoquinoline, benzimidazole, 2,2 bipyridine, o phenanthroline, 4 dimethylaminopyridine, and the like, In addition to covalent organic compounds, suitable Lewis bases include inorganic salts which can form complexes with Lewis acids, for example, chlorides, such as trimethylammonium chloride, tetramethylammonium chloride, sodium chloride or lithium chloride, perchlorates, trifluoromethanesulfonates and the like. Preferred Lewis bases for the practice of this invention are N methylformamide, N,N dimethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide, 1 methyl 2 pyrrolidone, tetramethylene sulfone also known as Sulfolane , n butyronitrile, dimethyl sulfide, imidazole, acetone, benzophenone, trimethylamine, trimethylamine hydrochloride, tetramethylammonium chloride, pyridine N oxide, 1 ethylpyridinium chloride, lithium chloride, lithium bromide, sodium chloride, sodium bromide, potassium chloride, potassium bromide and mixtures thereof. The amount of Lewis base present may be up to about 4 equivalents per equivalent of acid halide groups present in the reagent system. Amounts greater than 4 equivalents could be employed, if desired. However, no additional controlling effect is usually achieved by adding larger amounts. Thus, it is preferred to use no more than about 4 equivalents and generally about 2 equivalents. At least about 0.1, preferably at least about 0.2 and most preferably at least about 0.5 equivalents of Lewis base per equivalent of acid halide groups present should be used. The particular amount of Lewis base added depends to a certain extent on the nature of the monomers present. When a Lewis base is used to control the reaction the temperature at which the reaction is conducted can be from about 50 A non protic diluent can also be employed, if desired. Advantageously, the diluent should dissolve the Lewis acid Lewis base complex and the Lewis acid acyl compound complex. It should also be relatively inert toward Friedel Crafts reactions. Preferred diluents include, for example, methylene chloride, carbon disulfide, o dichlorobenzene, 1,2, 4 trichlorobenzene, o difluorobenzene, 1,2 dichloroethane, 1,1,2 trichloroethene, 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane, tetrachloroethene and mixtures thereof. In certain cases it may be advantageous to use an excess of the aromatic reactant, which also serves as a solvent for the reaction. If a diluent such as methylene chloride or dichloromethane is used, although we do not wish to be bound to any particular explanation it is believed that the Lewis acid Lewis base complex reduces the tendency of the diluent to act as an alkylating agent by competing with the diluent for available Lewis acid and thereby suppressing alkylation of reactant and or product. Alkylation of the aromatic component in the para or ortho position introduces undesirable impurities which often are difficult to remove by conventional purification methods. The diluent is preferably used in an amount from 20 to about 93 by weight, based on the weight of the total reaction mixture. It has been found that the reagent to diluent molar ratio can contribute to control of the reaction to yield the desired product. Typically the diluent is used in an amount of at least about 20 , preferably at least 30 by weight based on the weight of the reaction mixture. Typically the diluent is also used in an amount of less than 93 , preferably less than 80 , most preferably less than 60 . Use of an alkylating or acylating diluent can lead to undesired side reactions as mentioned above. When such solvents are employed, control of the reaction by techniques taught in this specification suppresses such alkylation or arylation. The result is an aryl carbonyl or sulfonyl compound of outstanding purity and or degree of para substitution. The compound produced contains catalyst residues complexed to the carbonyl group. Decomplexation can be accomplished by treating the reaction mixture with a decomplexing base after completion of the reaction. The base can be added to the reaction medium or the reaction medium can be added to the base. The decomplexing base must be at least as basic towards the Lewis acid as the basic groups on the polymer chain. Such decomplexation preferably should be effected before isolation of the product from the reaction mixture. The following examples illustrate the process of this invention using a variety of Lewis acids, Lewis bases, diluents and reagents. It is to be understood that other reactants and reaction media within the scope of the teaching of this invention can be employed, if desired.
