# Detonator actuator.

## Abstract
An actuator for use in conjunction with a detonator for blasting comprises electronic circuitry which on receiving input signals generates an output arm signal to arm a detona tor, and then after a predetermined delay an output actuate signal to fire the detonator and an associated explosive charge. The delay is capable of being remotely and precisely set. The actuator is preferably used in conjunction with a con trol device which has a microcomputer whose memory con tains arm and actuate codes and which has both arm and ac tuate keys. This microcomputer is such that the actuate key must be operated within a predetermined period after oper ation of the arm key, otherwise an actuate signal is not trans mitted to the actuator.
