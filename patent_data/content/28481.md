# Slitter.

## Abstract
A sitter and readily removable head 14, 15, 16 includes a drive housing 12 and an idle housing 14 projecting from a base 10 with the arbors 15, 16 for the slitting knives extending between the housings 12, 13 . The lower arbor 16 is journaled in vertically movable blocks 38, 57 with a jack system 88, 89, 90 in the base 10 thus moving the lower arbor 16 . The idle housing 14 and arbors 15, 16 are movable on the base 10 as a unit away from the drive housing 12 so that the idle housing 14 and arbors 15, 16 may readily be removed and replaced. The lower arbor journal block 57 of the idle housing 14 includes a T slot socket 79 engageable with one or more jacks 88, 89, 90 at a certain horizontal position so that arbors of different length may be employed. The idle housing 14 and arbors 15, 16 forming the removable head contain no gearing, jacks, jack drive connections or fluid or electrical lines requiring connection or disconnection. A turntable 126 may be employed to move the disconnected head 14, 15, 16 to a storage or retooling location. An overhead crane may also be employed to remove or replace the head 14, 15, 16 from or to the storage or tooling location. The slitter includes a horizontally movable actuator 105 with locating pins 109, 110 for quick assembly.
