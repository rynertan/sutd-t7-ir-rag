# Graft copolymers of alkyl methacrylates alkyl acrylates onto diene alkyl acrylate copolymers and their use as impact modifiers.

## Abstract
The impact resistance of resin compositions consisting of a thermoplastic polymer, particularly a homopolymer or copolymer of vinyl chloride can be improved by an impact additive of the graft copolymer type. The graft copolymer impact additive consists of a backbone composed of a statis tical copolymer of butadiene or isoprene, an alkyl acrylate of a C₂ to C₁₂ alkyl, and optionally a polyfunctional cross linking agent, onto which are grafted the chains of a statisti cal copolymer of an alkyl methacrylate of a C₁ to C₄ alkyl, particularly methyl methacrylate, and an alkyl acrylate of a C₁ to C₈ alkyl, particularly ethyl acrylate. The backbone of the graft copolymer impact additive comprises 0.5 35 by weight butadiene or isoprene, and up to 10 mole of the cross linking agent, while the graft chains of the graft co polymer comprise 5 to 50 mole of the alkyl acrylate of a C₁ to C₈ alkyl, and the weight ratio between the grafted chains and the backbone can range from 10 to 200 . The resin compositions are particularly useful to im prove impact strength at low temperatures.
