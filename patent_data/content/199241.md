## Description
This invention relates to a combined set of household electrical appliances and a handgrip therefor. As is known presently available on the market are hair driers and flatirons which are defined for the traveller, because in order to be less bulky and lighter in weight, these appliances are manufactured in smaller sizes than the corresponding household appliances for domestic use. In an attempt to further reduce the overall size of both hair driers and flatirons, of the so called traveller s type, these have been already made with the feature of foldable handgrip elements, so as to afford orderly stowage in the luggage. Such appliances are supplied individually with a rigid or soft case, and are in many cases provided with adapter plugs for international electric mains sockets, in addition to the possibility of including a supply voltage change to accommodate the various mains. With the known art solutions, however, these household appliances prevent the attainment of an optimum solution to the problem of reducing to a minimum the space reserved in the luggage, because they constitute at present two separate units with two discrete bulk sizes. Another drawback attributable to the known art solutions is that, while having voltage changer devices on their interiors, they are presently uncapable of preventing incidental wrong connection to the electric mains, with the likelihood of the electric component parts becoming damaged. The aim proposed for the invention is indeed that of eliminating the previously encountered drawbacks by providing a combined set of electric appliances and a handgrip therefor, which afford a rationally built assembly, wherein a single handgrip can be easily utilized for a number of household appliances consisting, for example, of a hair drier and flatiron. A power handle to be used with a plurality of diverse tool heads is disclosed by the document US A 4.050.003. The device according to such document is powered by battery means and does not provide means for connection to electric mains or protection against wrong connection, It is therefore a particular object of the invention to provide a combined set of household electrical appliances and a handgrip therefor, which affords the faculty of preventing accidental wrong electric connections, because the possibility of the household appliance being supplied with a higher voltage than the nominal voltage is not accidentally possible, but requires effectuation of two successive movements which rule out, accordingly, unintentionality of the wrong connection. Another object of this invention is to provide a combined set of household appliances and a handgrip therefor, which affords the possibility of drastically reducing bulk dimensions, providing a handgrip usable selectively with the various household appliances connectable thereto, and therefore, with the possibility of simplifying all aspects inherent to bulk and electric connection. A not least object of this invention is to provide a combined set which is particularly practical and functional, and which can give full assurance of being reliable and safe to use. The above mentioned aim, and the outlined objects and more to become apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a combined set of household electrical appliances and a handgrip therefor, according to the invention, with the features set forth in claim 1. Further features and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the combined set of household appliances and a handgrip therefor, with reference to the accompanying illustrative and not limitative drawings, where With reference to the cited figures, the combined set of household electrical appliances and handgrip therefor, according to the invention, comprises a handgrip element, generally designated with the reference numeral 1, which may be removably coupleable with the bodies of electric household appliances comprising, for example, a flatiron 2 and a hair drier 3. The cited handgrip element 1 has a body of elongate conformation 10 which at one end thereof defines a coupling element 11 which has a plane of lay disposed substantially laterally with respect to the longitudinal extent of the body 10. The coupling element 11 is removably insertable into a coupling seat 12 which is defined both on the flatiron 2 and the hair drier 3. Advantageously, the mechanical coupling is of the bayonet type with juxtaposed male wings 13, preferably provided on the handgrip 1, which fit below a border 14 defined by the coupling seat 12 and provided with inlet cutouts 15. The handgrip element 1 is provided with a cable 16 for connection to the electric mains which, with the interposition of a switch 17, is connected electrically to contacts provided at the coupling element. More in detail, the coupling element has an inner skirt 18 and an outer skirt 19 arranged concentrically to each other and defining an annular zone where electric contacts are provided which are generally indicated at 20 and elastically compliant. As shown best in the diagram of Figures 16 to 18 and in Figure 10, the contacts 20 are arranged circumferentially, and more precisely, there is a first contact 20a for connection to one phase, a second contact 20b and a third contact 20c interconnected together and a fourth contact 20d connectable to the other phase. Also provided is a central ground contact generally indicated at 20e. The household appliance consisting of the flatiron has correspondingly electric coupling contacts provided in the coupling seat 12. Such contacts, in the instance of the household appliance consisting of the flatiron, which are generally designated with the reference numeral 30, have first and second coupling contacts 30a and 30b, for connection to two phases, and a third contact 30c for connection to the center contact constituting the ground. The electric diagram of the flatiron contemplates on its interior an ordinary regulating thermostat which feeds an electric resistance heater for the plate, generally indicated at 31. Advantageously, the flatiron is usable with both the 110 120 Volts rating and the 220 240 Volts rating, with the one difference that in the instance of a power supply with the lower voltage rating, the times required for heating the plate are slightly longer. The handgrip element 1 is also coupleable with the hair drier which has, on its interior, in a manner known per se, a motor 41 that drives a fan 42 which introduces a flow of air through a resistance heater 43 provided at the outlet grid generally indicated at 44. The hair drier 3 is also provided with a coupling seat 12, similar to the previously described one, with the difference that it has coupling electric contacts variously arranged to permit of the voltage change according to the different uses. More in detail, correspondingly with the electric contacts 20 of the handgrip element there are provided in the coupling seat 12 of the hair drier 3 coupling contacts 50 distributed circumferentially, and consisting of a first 50a, of a second electric coupling contact 50b which are offset from each other angularly and connectable to a supply phase, also provided is a third electric coupling contact of the hair drier, indicated at 50c which serves a bypass function, as well as a fourth 50d and fifth 50e contact for hair drier coupling connectable to the other phase. As diagrammatically shown in Figure 17, in the first position the first contact 20a is placed in electric coupling with the first contact 50a, and the fourth contact 20d is placed in electric coupling with the fourth contact 50d of the hair drier, in this condition there occurs full electric insertion of the resistors 55 provided within the hair drier with the possibility of obtaining the supply at 220 240 Volts. In the diagram shown in Figure 18 the first contact 20a goes into electric conduction with the second contact 50b, whilst the second and third contacts 20b and 20c form an electric bypass between the third contact 50c and the fourth contact 50d, excluding in practice from operation some of the electric resistors, the fourth contact 20d is interconnected to the fifth contact 50e carrying the other phase of the electric supply. The change in the supply voltage is accomplished by a different angular setting on the handgrip element 1 with respect to the hair drier, and there is provided a locking element which prevents accidental overloading of the hair drier electric circuit that retainer element comprises a locking segment 60 which engages by contact with one of the wings 13 preventing their further rotation, thereby the electric contacts of the handgrip arrange themselves in accordance with the wiring diagram of Figure 17. The retainer segment 60 is connected to a slider 61 biased elastically by a spring 62 and being accessible from outside the hair drier. If the electric power supply at 110 120 Volts is to be effected, it is sufficient to act on the slider 61 to overcome the elastic bias of the spring 62 and consequently disengage the segment 60 from the wing 13, so as to allow a further rotation distance for the handgrip element in the coupling phase, as shown in Figure 14, thus enabling positioning of the electric contacts in conformity with the diagram shown in Figure 18. Thus, accidental overloading of the hair drier s electric components is made impossible, because to permit powering at the lowest voltage value, that is the voltage of 110 120 Volts, it is necessary to carry out a subsequent operation consisting of translating the slider 61 to disengage the removable lock. Also provided in the coupling seat 12 is a retainer dog 63 which couples with the other of the wings 13 to carry out the proper positioning of the handgrip element for a 110 120 Volts supply. When the handgrip is removed, the spring 62 acts to automatically return the slider 61 to the initial position, with consequent positioning in the retained conditions of the segment 60. It should be also added to the foregoing that the handgrip element, and the household appliances described, consisting of the flatiron and the hair drier, may be housed within a containment box 70 where connectors for different voltages generally indicated at 71 may also be positioned, so as to provide an extremely versatile assembly which can adapt itself automatically to all conditions of use. It may be appreciated from the above description that the invention achieves its objects and in particular the fact should be emphasized that the combined set has a single handgrip element, carrying the electric supply contacts, which is practically and readily positionable on the household appliance to be used, thus reducing bulk considerably. Furthermore, the particular arrangement of the contacts allows the voltage change for the hair drier to be obtained merely by different positioning of the handgrip element relatively to the hair drier body, which positioning cannot originate incidental errors owing to the provision of the retainer element formed by the segment 60. In practicing the invention, the materials used, so long as compatible with the specific use, and the dimensions and contingent shapes, may be any ones according to requirements.
