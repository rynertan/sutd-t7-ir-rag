# Integrated logic circuit.

## Abstract
A logic circuit of the IÂ²L, the ISL or the STL type having a signal input formed by the control electrode 1 of an inverter transistor T1 and plural signal outputs 2 each coupled through a diode D1 to a main electrode 5 of the inverter transistor, this main electrode being connected to a supply line 3 through a pull up connection. The improvement relates to a further connection path comprising in series a Schottky diode D2 and a resistor R which bridges the main current path of the inverter transistor and which reduces the voltage swing at the said main electrode.
