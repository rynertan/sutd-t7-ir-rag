# Single shot multivibrator.

## Abstract
A multivibrator comprising two inverting OR circuits 1 , 2 connected in closed loop configuration by a cascaded series of delaying elements 11, 12, 13 some of which are partially bypassed at selected locations so as to reduce the recovery time of the multivibrator. The delaying elements comprise one or more inverting OR circuits 13 positioned at the selected locations with the remainder being simple inverting circuits. Although the output pulse width of the multivibrator is determined by the total delay of the cas caded units, the recovery time is made a fraction thereof, depending upon the number and the locations of the bypasses.
