## Description
A VALVEThis invention relates to a valve.In a conventional heater unit of a motor vehicle, hot water from an engine cooling system is supplied to a heat exchanger by a valve which can be manually opened and closed by a lever system. When the valve is open hot water from the engine cooling system is circulated through the heat exchanger to heat air which is to be blown into the interior of the vehicle. By adjusting the valve the temperature of the air to be blown into the interior of the vehicle can be crudely controlled. However, the temperature of the water from the engine cooling system varies in dependence upon the conditions under which the engine is operated and tends to rise when the engine is under load or when air flow through the vehicle rad ator is reduced. It is, therefore, difficult to maintain the air supplied by the heater to the interior of the vehicle at any chosen temperature.According to the present invention there is provided a valve comprising a first inlet and a first outlet in communication with each other a second inlet and a second outlet a movable member movable between a first position in which it restricts communication between the first inlet and the second outlet and permits communication between the second inlet and the second outlet and a second position in which it restricts communication between the second inlet and the second outlet and permits communication between the first inlet and the second outlet biasing means for biasing the movable member towards the first position and drive means for moving the movable member towards the second position against the action of the biasing means.Preferred features of the invention will be apparent from the subsidiary claims of the application.The invention will now be described, merely by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a cross sectional view of one embodiment of a valve according to the invention Figure 2 is a graph illustrating operation of the valve andFigure 3 is a graph showing operation of the valve when used to control a heater unit.The valve shown in Figure 1 is a valve connected to supply coolant water from a cooling system of an internal combustion engine to a heater unit of a motor vehicle. The invention will be described in relation to such a valve but it will be appreciated that the invention is equally applicable to valves used in other applications. The illustrated valve comprises an outer casing 1 with a first inlet 2 connected to receive water from a cooling system not shown of an internal combustion engine, a first outlet 3 connected to supply the water to a heater unit not shown , a second inlet 4 connected to receive water returning from the heater unit, and a second outlet 5 connected to return water to the cooling system of the internal combustion engine. The first inlet 2 is in direct communication with the first outlet 9. Communication between the first and second inlets 2 and 4 and the second outlet 5 is, however, controlled by a poppet valve 6.In the position shown in Figure 1, the poppet valve 6 is pressed against a first valve seat 7 by a spring 8round the valve stem 6A to restrict commanication between the first inlet 2 and the second outlet 5. In this position, the poppet valve 6 is lifted off the second valve seat 9 so that communication is permitted between the second inlet 4 and the second outlet 5. The poppet valve 6 is provided with s double sided rubber seal 10 for sealing against the first and second valve seats 7 and 9. A soft iron disc 11 is attached to the ena of the valve stem 6A. To move the poppet valve 6 away from the first valve seat 7 and towards the second valve seat 9, a solenoid 12 mounted outside the outer casing 1 is actuated to attract the soft iron disc 11.As the soft iron disc 11 is attracted towards the solenoid 12, it pulls the poppet valve 6 away from the first valve seat 7 against the action of the spring 8 until the seal 10 is pressed against the second valve seat 9. In this position which is not illustrated , coitinication between the second inlet 4 and the second outlet 5 ia restricted and communication is permitted between the first inlet 2 and the second outlet 5.In operation, the valve supplies hot water to a heat exchanger of an air heater unit via the first outlet 3 and it passes water returning from the heater unit back to the engine cooling system via the second inlet 4 and the second outlet 5 when the poppet valve 6 is in the position ilustratid it Figure 1. If the pressure of water supplied to the first inlet 2 rises due to an increase in engine speed, the pressure lifts the poppet valve 6 off the first valve seat 7 so thates√≥es water flow is by passed back to the engine through the second outlet 5 without being circulated through the heater unit.It will be appreciated that as the poppet valve 6 gradually moves away from the first valve seat 7 to permit communication between the first inlet 2 and the second outlet 5, communication between the second inlet 4 and the second outlet 5 is at the same time gradually restricted. By this means, the flow rate of water through the heater unit can be maintained substantially constant regardless of engine speed once the speed has risen above a predetermined speed such as idling speed. The spring rate of the spring 8 is, of course, selected in dependance upon the desired flow rate through the heater unit.It will be appreciated that if the seal 10 is pressed against the second valve seat 9, all water entering the first inlet 2 is by passed through the valve to the second outlet 5 and circulation of water through the heater unit is shut off. The graph shown in Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the flow of water to the heater unit and the total flow of water through the valve. As will be seen, the flow through the heater unit is substantially constant once it has reached a predetermined level. The control of flow rate of water through the heater unit described above does not, however, provide a sufficiently fine control of the temperature of air emitted by the heater unit since, as mentioned above, the temperature of the engine coolant water varies with the conditions under which the engine is operated. In order to provide the fine control required, the temperature of the air emitted by the heater unit is sensed and the solenoid 12 is actuated at intervais to shut off the circulation of water through the heater unit. Thus, if the temperature sensed is above a predetermined temperature the solenoid 12 is actuated to stop the flow of water through the heater unit until the temperature drops whereupon the solenoid 12 is de actuated so that the poppet valve 6 returns to the position illustrated in Figure 1 and water again ciculates through the heater unit. It has been found that if the solenoid 12 is periodically actuated to open and shut the communication between the second inlet 4 and the second outlet 5 for intervals of between 5 and 60 seconds at a rate of up to 6 cycles per minute in dependence upon the predetermined temperature required and the sensed temperature, the 0 air emitted from the heater unit can be maintained within 3 C of a desired temperature despite changes in engine speed and load and changes in outside temperature. The graph shown in Figure 3 illustrates the changes in temperature of water leaving the heater unit and the temperature of air emitted by right hand and left hand vents of the heater unit as engine speed is increased. It will be seen that the temperature of air emitted by the heater is maintained substantially at a predetermined level regardless of engine speed.The many small fluctuations in the curves illustrated are, of course, due to the flow of water through the heater being repeatedly shut off by actuation of the solenoid 12. The heater system may, of course, be provided with a control for setting the predetermined temperature or for adjusting this temperature as required.As the poppet valve 6 operates in a force balanced manner, ie its position between the two valve seats 7 and 9 is determined by the balance between the forces on it due to compression of the spring 8 and the pressure of water supplied to the first inlet 2, the force required to move the poppet valve 6 towards the second valve seat 9 is very low so only a low power solenoid 12 is required.It should also be noted that the force acting on the soft iron disc 11 due to actuation of the solenoid 12 increases with the inverse square of the distance between the disc 11 and the solenoid 12 so that once the poppet valve 6 starts to move towards the second valve seat 9 it rapidly and reliably moves to shut off the circulation through the heater unit since the opposing force due to compression of the spring 8 only increases linearly with the decrease in distance between the disc 11 and the solenoid 12. In the illustrated embodiment, the soft iron disc 11 is positioned in a chamber 13 which is in communication with water received through the second inlet 4. Movement of the disc 11 in the chamber 13 towards and away from the solenoid 12 is therefore damped and this prevents the poppet valve 6 from vibrating between the first and second valve seats 7 and 9.It will be appreciated that the electronically controlled valve described above is particularly suitable for use in a remote control or fully automatic temperature control system of a motor vehicle. The valve can be operated to control the flow of water to the heater unit in dependence upon signals received from temperature sensors such as fine bead thermistors measuring the temperature of air emitted from the heater unit or in dependence upon signals received from other sensing means. The valve can also be used to automatically control the temperature of the air within a motor vehicle by sensing interior and exterior temperatures.As previously mentioned, a valve according to this invention may be used in other applications besides that described above to control the flow of fluid to a component connected to the first outlet 3 and the second inlet 4. It will also be apparent that many of the features of the valve described above can be varied or changed without departing from the invention.
