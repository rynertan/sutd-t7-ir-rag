## Abstract
A device for the extraction of juice from fruits, especially citrus fruit and the like, said device comprising in combina tion compression means designed to be located in the cor rect working position, said position being a function of the fruit size, through the displacement along a longitudinal axis, so as to enclose the whole fruit body and to block the same in the working position and successively to push the fruit against piercing means which are provided on their side surfaces with openings, said piercing means being able to penetrate the fruit rind so as to remove small pieces or plugs from it, and squeezing means which can move reciprocating ly and longitudinally so as to press the fruit body to make the fruit juice to flow out of the openings of said piercing means, extractor means which can move longitudinally in a recipro cating way and associated to said piercing means, and con trolled by a tappet system, said means being designed to extract said small pieces or plugs after the piercing opera tion and to expel the squeezed fruit, in which the plugs have been replaced.
