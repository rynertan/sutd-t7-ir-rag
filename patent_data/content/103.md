# Purification of glycoproteins and use of glycoproteins to form antiserum compositions.

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for the purification of glycoproteins, particularly the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotrophin, by polyacrylamide gel electrohoresis using the magnesium salt of 8 anilino 1 napthalene sulfonic acid as a fluorescent probe. Also disclosed is an antiserum composition produced by using spleen immunization of glycoprotein antigens.
