EP 0 129 847 and US A 4 178 449 describe pyrazolo 1,5 a pyrimidines substituted, inter alia, at the 2,3 and 7 position, which exhibit anxiolytic or antiepileptic activity. The novel compounds of this invention may be readily prepared as set forth in the following reaction scheme In accordance with the above reaction scheme a 1 acetylphenyl 3 amide 1 , where R₆ is as described above is reacted with dimethylformamide dimethylacetal at reflux giving an Alternatively, N 3 3 dialkylamino 1 oxo 2 propenyl phenyl alkanamide 5 is reacted with a 3 aminopyrazole 3 to give intermediates 6 which are reacted with a base such as sodium hydride, sodium alkoxide and the like and an R₅ halide to give the products 4 . The performance of the novel compounds of the present invention in standard tests with laboratory animals which are known to correlate well with relief of anxiety in man indicates that they possess central nervous system activity at nontoxic doses and thus are useful as anxiolytic agents. Furthermore, these compounds have been shown by biological data to be useful as antiepileptic agents, particularly in the treatment of grand mal epilepsy seizures, and as sedative hypnotic and skeletal muscle relaxant agents. The anti anxiety and anticonvulsant properties of the novel compounds of the present invention have been established in a test which indicates anxiolytic and anti epileptic activity by the measure of protection they provide from convulsions resulting from the administration of pentylenetetrazole. Single or graded dose levels of the test compounds were administered orally or intraperitoneally in a 2 starch vehicle, containing 0.5 v v polyethylene glycol and one drop of Polysorbate 80 to groups of at least 4 rats. At 30 or 60 minutes, the rats were treated intravenously with pentylenetetrazole at a dose of 23 mg kg of body weight. This dose is estimated to cause clonic seizures in 99 of unprotected rats. It has been reported R. T. Hill and D. H. Tedeschi, Animal Testing and Screening Procedures in Evaluating Psychotropic Drugs in An Introduction to Psychopharmacology , Eds. R. R. Rech and K. E. Moore, Raven Press, New York. p. 237 288 1971 that there is a high degree of correlation between the ability of compounds to inhibit the seizure inducing effect of pentylenetetrazole in rats and the effectiveness of those compounds as anxiolytic and anticonvulsive agents in higher warm blooded animals. The results of this test on representative compounds of the present invention are shown in Table I. Another test which has been used to assess anti anxiety effects is a nonconditioned passive avoidance procedure described by J. R. Vogel, B. Beer and D. E. Clody, A Simple and Reliable Conflict Procedure for Testing Anti Anxiety Agents , Psychopharmacologia, Groups of 6 native, Wistar strain rats, weighing 200 240 g each were deprived of water for 48 hours and food for 24 hours. The test compounds were administered in single or graded, oral or intraperitoneal doses, suspended in a 2 starch vehicle containing 0.5 v v polyethylene glycol and one drop of polysorbate 80. Control animals received the vehicle alone. At 30 to 60 minutes each rat was placed in an individual plexiglass chamber. Water was available Another test utilized for the determination of anxiolytic activity is the measurement of the ability of test compounds to inhibit the binding of tritiated benzodiazepines to brain specific receptors of warm blooded animals. A modification of the method described by R. F. Squires, Male albino rats Wistar strain, weighing 150 200 g each were obtained from Royalhart Farms. ³H Methyldiazepam 79.9 Ci mmol and ³H methylflunitrazepam 84.3 Ci mmol were obtained from New England Nuclear. The test compounds were solubilized in either dimethylformamide, acetic acid, ethanol or hydrochloric acid. Whole cortex of rats was homogenized gently in 20 volumes of ice cold 0.32 M sucrose, centrifuged twice at 1000 g for 10 minutes and then recentrifuged at 30,000 g for 20 minutes to produce a crude P₂ synaptosomal fraction. The P₂ fraction was either 1 resuspended in twice the original volume in hyponotic 50 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.4 , or 2 resuspended in one half the original volume in hypotonic 10 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.4 and then was frozen 20 C until time of use. Frozen P₂ preparations were thawed and resuspended in four times the original homogenizing volume at time of assay. The binding assay consisted of 300 µl of the P₂ fraction suspension 0.2 0.4 mg protein , 100 µl of test drug and 100 µl of ³H diazepam 1.5 nM, final concentration or ³H flunitrazepam 1.0 nM, final concentration which was added to 1.5 ml of 50 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.4 . Non specific binding controls and total binding controls received 100 µl of diazepam 3 M, final concentration and 100 µl of deionized water, respectively, in place of the test compound. Incubation for 30 minutes proceeded in ice and was terminated by filtration, under vacuum, through Whatman GF C glass fiber filters. The filters were washed twice with 5 ml of ice cold 50 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.4 and placed in scintillation vials. After drying at 50 60 C for 30 minutes, 10 ml of Beckman Ready Solv HP a high performance pre mix scintillation cocktail, registered trademark of Beckman Instruments, Inc., Irvine, CA 92713 was added and the radioactivity determined in a scintillation counter. Inhibition of binding was calculated by the difference between total binding and binding in the presence of test compound, divided by the total binding x 100. The results of this test on representative compounds of the present invention are given in Table III. The novel compounds of this invention have also been shown to have skeletal muscle relaxant activity through the use of two tests. The first test measures the effect of representative compounds on the ability of rats to remain on an inclined screen. Groups of at least 6 rats were treated orally with graded doses of test compounds or vehicle and placed on a wire mesh screen inclined at an angle of 60 from a horizontal level 65 minutes later. The number of rats falling off the screen within 30 minutes was recorded. The ED₅₀ dose necessary to cause 50 of the animals tested to fall off was calculated according to the linear arcsine transformation method of Finney, D. J., Statistical Methods in Biological Assay , 2nd Ed., Hafner, N. Y., 1964, p. 454. Compounds were dissolved or suspended in a 2 aqueous starch suspension containing 5 polyethylene glycol 400 and a drop of polysorbate 80, and administered in a constant volume of 5 ml kg. The results of representative compounds of this invention appear in Table IV. The second test to illustrate that the novel compounds of the present invention possess skeletal muscle relaxant properties shows the effect of representative compounds on the locomotor activity in rats. Groups of 6 rats were treated orally with vehicle 5 ml kg or graded doses of the test compounds. Sixty minutes later, individual rats were placed in Actophotometers and locomotor activity was measured for 5 minutes after a brief 30 sec. habituation period. Motor activity counts number of crossings of the photo cells were recorded for each rat, and mean activity counts were calculated for each treatment group. The dose causing a 50 decrease in mean activity counts compared with the vehicle group MDD₅₀ was calculated from a linear regression equation. The test results of representative compounds appear in Table V. The novel compounds of the present invention have been found to be highly useful for drug therapy in mammals when administered in amounts ranging from about 0.1 mg to about 20.0 mg kg of body weight per day. A preferred dosage regimen for optimum results would be from about 0.5 mg to about 10.0 mg kg of body weight per day. Dosage units are employed such that a total of from about 10 to about 700 mg of active compound for a subject of about 70 kg of body weight are administered in a 24 hour period. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. The compounds of this invention are preferably administered orally but may be administered in any convenient manner such as by the intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous routes. Compositions according to the present invention having the desired clarity, stability and adaptability for parenteral use are obtained by dissolving from 0.10 to 10.0 by weight of active compound in a vehicle consisting of a polyhydric aliphatic alcohol or mixtures thereof. Especially satisfactory are glycerin, propylene glycol, and polyethylene glycols. The polyethylene glycols consist of a mixture of nonvolatile, normally liquid, polyethylene glycols which are soluble in both water and organic liquids and which have molecular weights of from about 200 to 1500. Although the amount of active compound dissolved in the above vehicle may vary from 0.10 to 10.0 by weight, it is preferred that the amount of active compound employed be from about 3.0 to about 9.0 by weight. Although various mixtures of the aforementioned nonvolatile polyethylene glycols may be employed, it is preferred to use a mixture having an average molecular weight of from about 200 to about 400. In addition to the active compound, the parenteral solutions may also contain various preservatives which may be used to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination. The preservatives which may be used for these purposes are, for example, myristyl gamma picolinium chloride, benzalkonium chloride, phenethyl alcohol, p chlorophenyl alpha glycerol ether, methyl and propyl parabens, and thimerosal. As a practical matter, it is also convenient to employ antioxidants. Suitable antioxodants include, for example, sodium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, and sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate. Generally, from about 0.05 to about 0.2 concentrations of antioxidant are employed. For intramuscular injection, the preferred concentration of active compound is 0.25 to 0.50 mg ml of the final compositions. The novel compounds of the present invention are equally adapted to intravenous administration when diluted with water or diluents employed in intravenous therapy such as isotonic glucose in appropriate quantities. For intravenous use, initial concentrations down to about 0.05 to 0.25 mg ml of active ingredient are satisfactory. The active compounds of the present invention may be orally administered, for example, with an inert diluent or with an assimilable edible carrier, or they may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, or compressed into tablets, or incorporated directly into the food of the diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compounds may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers and the like. Additionally, the active ingredient may be incorporated with the proper pharmaceutical carrier or carriers known in the art to produce a sustained release tablet or capsule. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1 of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60 of the weight of the unit dose. The amount of 2 750 mg active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained. The tablets, troches, pills, capsules and the like may also contain one or more of the following a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin excipients such as dicalcium phosphate a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like a lubricant such as magnesium stearate a wetting agent such as sodium lauryl sulfate and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin may be added or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen or cherry flavoring. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets, pills or capsules may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any dosage unit form should be pharmaceutically pure and substantially nontoxic in the amounts employed.
