# Cross linked polyesteramides and production thereof.

## Abstract
A new cross linked polyester amide having structure in which the ester amide chain of the formula below RCONHCH₂CH₂OR OCH₂CH₂NHCO R wherein R and R each are a bivalent hydrocarbon radical n is a positive integer as obtained by the reaction of a bis 2 oxazoline compound and a dicarboxylic acid is con tained in the polymer chain and at least 5 of its NH group is cross linked with a 2 oxazoline ring by ring opening addition reaction. The cross linked polyesteramide is tough and excel in abrasion resistance and solvent resistance and can be utilized in the molding of machinery parts such as rolls and gears and embedded molding of electrical machinery and apparatus parts as well as for electric insulating materials and materials for dental uses. The resin composition comprising the said cross linked polyesteramide and about 3 to 95 weight of reinforce ments and or fillers can provide the molding material having excellent mechanical properties, especially outstanding toughness, that cannot possibly be expected with conven tional fiber reinforced plastics and also exhibiting superior characteristics such as thermal properties. The resin composition can be utilized not only in the application fields for conventional fiber reinforced plastics but also in the new application areas where conventional fiber reinforced plastics have failed to achieve application development.
