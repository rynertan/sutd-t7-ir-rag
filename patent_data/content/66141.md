# Electrophotographic recording method.

## Abstract
In an electrophotographic recording method in which electric charge is uniformly applied to the surface of a photoconductive drum 1 , the drum surface is then exposed to a first information light beam 3A to form a first negative latent image, the first negative latent image is developed with a first two component developer 4B , the drum surface is further exposed to a second information light beam 5A to form a second negative latent image, and the second negative latent image is developed with a second two component developer 6B to produce a two color toner image, the toner content α₂ in the second two component developer is made larger than that α₁ in the first two component developer
