# Reconfigurable memory.

## Abstract
In a reconfigurable memory a spare chip 40 is sub stituted for a faulty chip when an uncorrectable error con dition results from an alignment of two errors in bit positions accessed through the same chip row decoder 12 while an address bit permutation apparatus 30, 32 is used to mis align faulty bits when they occur in bit positions accessed through different decoders.
