# Container preforms of nitrile thermoplastic material.

## Abstract
Preforms, for conversion into containers for environ mentally sensitive materials, made of thermoplastic ma terial comprising at least 20 weight percent of a polymeriz ed nitrile group containing monomer and an effective amount of an HCN scavenger are characterized by con taining no more than about 1.5 ppm of unpolymerized ni trile group containing monomer based on the total weight of the thermoplastic material. The performs can be obtain ed by subjecting a conventional preform to low dosage electron beam irradiation.
