# Slide fastener chain and method of and cutter for manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A slide fastener chain comprises a pair of interengaged stringers including a pair of stringer tapes 11,12 , one 11 longer than the other 12 , which have longitudinally staggered ends 19,23 spaced from each other by a distance M greater than the length L of a slider 70 which is to be mounted on the slide fastener chain. The coupling heads 53,54 of a predetermined number of coupling elements 13 on the longer stringer tape 11 adjacent to the end 23 of the shorter stringer tape 12 and remote from the end 19 of the longer stringer tape 11 are cut off so that the coupling elements 18 thus severed are kept uncoupled from opposite companion coupling elements 14 on the shorter stringer tape 12 . The slide fastener chain thus constructed can smoothly be threaded through the slider 70 . The slide fastener chain is fabricated by cutting a continuous slide fastener chain 10 transversely fully thereacross to define a transverse edge a of the chain, transversely fully across one of the stringers 12 to form a transverse slit b spaced from the transverse edge a , and longitudinally across a certain number of coupling elements 13 below the transverse slit to form a longitudinal slit c cutting off the coupling heads 53,54 , which are held between the opposite companion coupling elements 14 .
