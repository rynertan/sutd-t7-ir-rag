# Copying machine having reduced image memory.

## Abstract
In a copying machine comprising a photosensitive drum having an amorphous silicon type photoconductive layer, if an image of an original is focussed on the photoconductive layer with a light having a wavelength shorter than 600 nm, the light fatigue of the amorphous silicon photoconductive layer is pre vented, and the image memory phenomenon owing to the light fatigue is effectively obviated.
