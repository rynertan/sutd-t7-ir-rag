# METHOD OF MAKING 5,6 DIHYDRO 2 METHYL N PHENYL 1,4 OXATHIIN 3 CARBOXAMIDE

## Abstract
A method of making 2 methyl N phenyl 1,3 oxathio lane 2 acetamide 3 oxide characterised in that the me thod comprises bringing together 2 methyl N phenyl 1,3 oxathiolane 2 acetamide und hydrogen peroxide under basic conditions in the presence of a catalytic quantity of a heavy metal compound oxidation catalyst in a liquid medium comprising water or water plus at least one nonprotic organic solvent liquid selected from a an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent having a boiling point not greater than 145 C, b a chlorinated hydrocarbon sol vent having a boiling point not greater than 130 C, and c a solvent having a boiling point not greater than 130 C which is an alkyl ester of an aliphatic carboxylic acid, and subjecting the resulting mixture while agitating to a temperature of from 0 25 C, whereby 2 methyl N phenyl 1,3 oxathiolane 2 acetamide 3 oxide is formed. The product may be used for the preparation of 5,6 di hydro 2 methyl N phenyl 1,4 oxathi in 3 carboxamide which is a known bactericide and fungicide.
