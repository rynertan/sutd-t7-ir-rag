# Hot gas measuring probe.

## Abstract
An oxygen probe for measuring the characteristics of furnace gases. The probe includes electrodes of a long lasting and relatively inexpensive nickel containing alloy. The probe is formed with apertures and internal passages for ventilating the three phase contact zones between gas, electrolyte, and electrodes with furnace gases, thereby minimizing errors due to catalytic reactions at the electrodes. The probe sheath may be composed of the same alloy as the electrodes, and the electrodes may be fabricated as an integral part of the sheath, so that the sheath serves both as a structural member and as an electrical conductor for con ducting voltage generated within the electrodes. A gas pump may be used to assure adequate ventilation to the electrode electrolyte interfaces.
