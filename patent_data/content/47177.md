# Improved scanning gamma camera.

## Abstract
By reason of the scanning regimen followed by a scanning gamma camera head, and the shape of the active region of the head, not all of the elemental areas of a scanned radiation field are observed by the active region of the head for the same period of time. This non uniformity sensitivity of the system is corrected by correction factors S.C.F. that are either analytically calculated or experimen tally determined for each given elemental area of the map that represents the radiation field 10 . The map of an unknown radiation field 10 obtained by following the scanning regimen 18 is corrected by applying the sensitiv ity correction factors to the contents of corresponding elemental areas of the map.
