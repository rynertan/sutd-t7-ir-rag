# A method for producing thermoplastic resin molded articles.

## Abstract
A method for producing thermoplastic resin molded articles is described which comprises heating a sheet com prising a crystalline thermoplastic resin, which is crosslink ed to a degree of crosslinking of more than 5 , to a tem perature higher than the melting point of the crosslinked thermoplastic resin and below the decomposition tempe rature of the same, and press molding the preheated sheet between a pair of press molds maintained at a temperature below the melting point of the crosslinked crystalline ther moplastic resin.
