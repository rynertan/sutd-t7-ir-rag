# Continuously variable power transmission.

## Abstract
A continuously variable power transmission with wide ra tio coverage has a variable ratio belt drive 30, 98, 100 in series with a fixed ratio drive 138, 140, 156 which is selectively con nectible between the input and output shafts 24, and 94, 96 . A pair of selectively engageable clutches 54 and 162 co op erate with the belt drive to provide two continuously variable speed ratio ranges. A transition clutch 64 maintains power flow between the input and output shafts during shifting from one range to the other. The belt drive is controlled between the maximum and minimum drive ratios in each speed range. The belt ratio is held constant while the transition clutch is en gaged.
