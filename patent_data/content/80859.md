# Microwave coupler devices.

## Abstract
A microwave coupler device of planar circuit form, similar in form to a conventional branch arm coupler in that it comprises a substrate 23 having a ground plane conductor on one main face and an electrically conductive pattern on the other main face comprising a central portion 25 and four strip portions 27, 29, 31, 33 extending therefrom, but in which the central portion, instead of comprising four limbs in a rectangular configuration, is in the form of a rectangle with the strip portions extending from positions adjacent the corners of the rectangle.
