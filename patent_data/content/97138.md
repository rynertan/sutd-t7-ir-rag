# A hydraulic pump or hydraulic motor.

## Abstract
A hydraulic pump or hydraulic motor of the kind in which the active components include at least two co acting gears arranged in wells which accurately conform to the gears and which communicate with channels for supply oil and return oil respectively. To enable the displacement of the pump or motor to be readily changed, the housing of the pump or motor is made in two parts 1, 2 which can be sealingly coupled to gether. The one part 1 , the mounting part, in which the input shaft 3 of the pump, or the output shaft 3 of the motor, is journalled is provided with the requisite inlet and outlet 10,11 for supply oil and return oil respectively. The shaft 3 passes completely through the mounting part 1 and projects from the end surface of the mounting part located in the dividing plane of the housing, for receiving a sun wheel 5 . The requisite journal shafts 8, 9 for the necessary planet wheels 6, 7 also project out from the same end surface, and channels for supply oil and return oil respectively discharge into this end surface. The other part of the housing has the form of a readily ex changeable cover 2 which serves as a pressure chamber and which is provided with wells 16 for the planet wheels 5, 6, 7 . The cover 2 is also provided with bores 17, 18, 19, 20 which extend from the surface of the cover located in the di viding plane of the housing and which communicate with the aforementioned wells. These bores are arranged, when the cover 2 is mounted onto the mounting part 1 to connect with the mouths 12, 13, 14, 15 of the oil supply channels and the oil return channels respectively in the end surface of the mounting part.
