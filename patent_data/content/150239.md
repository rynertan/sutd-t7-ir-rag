# Process and apparatus for upgrading crude oil and residual fractions thereof.

## Abstract
A process and apparatus for upgrading a petroleum charge of crude oil or residual fractions thereof to provide a product with substantially reduced heavy metals content and Conradson Carbon number. The charge is dispersed into a descending curtain of heated, substantially inert con tact material. This contact material preferably has a conver sion rate not substantially greater than 10 in the CAT D test. The vapors generated on contact of the charge with the curtain are collected immediately from the side of the cur tain opposite from where the charge is dispersed. The col lected vapors are cooled to avoid thermal cracking. The product is suitable for catalytic cracking or use as heavy fuel or heavy fuel precursor.
