# ANTENNA AND METHOD FOR FABRICATING SAME

## Abstract
An antenna 10 and method for fabricating the antenna 10 includes an inner panel 12 with a curved inner receiving surface 14 and on outer panel 16 in coextensive relation ship to one another. A plurality of strips 20 having un dulations 22 are positioned between the inner 12 and outer 16 panels for interlocking the panels 12,16 together in pre determined positions to define a composite antenna 10 of substantial strength to present the inner surface pre determined close tolerances over the surface thereof. The un dulations 22 of the strip 20 include platform forms 24 for engaging the panels 12, 16 and straight angulated port ions 26 interconnecting the platform portions 24 . The strip 20 includes raised ribs 30 in the straight portions 26 and hinge portions 28 between the straight portions 26 and platform portions 24 to allow the lateral extent of the strip 20 to increase as the thickness of the strip 20 between the panels 12, 16 is decreased during fabrication.
