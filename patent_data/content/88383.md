## Description
The present invention relates to a process for preparing the compound 1 decycloxy 4 7 oxa 4 octynyl oxy benzene and, more particularly, it relates to a process for synthetising said compound consisting in condensing methyl propargyl ether with l bromo 3 chloro propane and in reacting the resulting intermediate with 4 decyloxy phenol in the presence of an alkaline hydroxide. European patent application No. 37,092, in the name of the Applicant hereof, describes compounds endowed with a high acaricide activity, among which also the compound l decyloxy 4 7 oxa 4 octynyl oxyJ benzene of formula EMI1.1 hereinafter referred to as compound I . In the abovesaid European patent application, synthesis processes suitable for the preparation of the various acaricide compounds are described too. These processes include also the process indicated by the following Scheme 1, where it is described in the specific form suited to the synthesis of compound I. Scheme 1EMI2.1 Reaction I of Scheme 1 consists in protecting the al coholic function of 3 bromo propanol to prepare the successive reaction. Reaction 1 is an example of the preparation of the tetrahydropyranyl derivative, but it is possible to protect the hydroxy group also according to other variants known in organic chemistry. Reaction 2 represents the reaction between the lithium salt acetylide of methyl propargyl ether and 3 bromo pro panol protected on the alcoholic function A . Acetylide is generally prepared in situ by reacting methyl propargyl ether with lithium butyl. It is then necessary to free the product obtained by reaction 2 B from the protective group on the terminal end hydroxyl group reaction 3 . The alcohol thus obtained C is then converted into the corresponding p.toluene sulphonic ester by reaction with p.toiuene sulphonic acid chloride in order to transform the terminal hydroxyl group into a group more reactive as leav ing group reaction 4 . p.toluene sulphonate D is then condensed with the sodium salt of 4 decyloxy phenol according to reaction 5. The process described hereinabove exhibits various drawbacks which render it not very useful to be utilized on an industrial scale. These drawbacks depend on the necessity of carrying out necessary but expensive operations, such as protection of the hydroxy group reaction 1 , freeing the hydroxy group from the protective group reaction 3 and functionalising the hydroxy group as p.toluene sulphonate reaction 4 . These and other reactions require the use of expensive and dangerous reagents such as lithium butyl and the chlori de of p.toluene sulphonic acid, which are practically impos sible to recover. Furthermore, in relation to the fact that the process consists of a number of steps and that for some of them it is necessary to isolate the resulting intermediates, the process yields are not particularly high. The Applicant has now found a process which represents the object of the present invention for synthetising compound I consisting in reacting the sodium salt of methyl propargyl ether acetylide with l bromo 3 chloro propane to obtain the compound of formula Cll3 O CH2 Ca mC CH2 CH2 CH2 Cl and in reacting the latter with the sodium salt of 4 decyloxy phenol, according to the reactions shown in following Scheme 2.Scheme 2EMI4.1 The compound l methoxy 6 chloro hexyne 2 compound of formula II is new and constitutes, as such, a further object of the present invention. Methyl propargyl ether and l bromo 3 chloro propane are known, commercially available compounds. Reaction 1 is conducted in a solvent mixture composed of tetrahydrofuran THF and of an aprotic polar solvent in amounts ranging from 5 to 50 by volume, referred to THF, pre ferably from 10 to 30 . The preferred aprotic polar solvents are dimethylsulphoxide DM50 and hexamethylene phosphorus triamide HMPA . It should be noticed that without the presence of the aprotic polar solvent, the reaction does not occur at all or takes place with non significant yields. Since reaction 1 is exothermic, it is preferably operated at temperatures of approximate OOC from 10 to 10 C allowing the temperature to rise, at a later stage, up to room temperature values. The sodium salt of methyl propargyl ether CH3O CH2 C C is prepared in situ by reacting in anhy drous THF methyl propargyl ether in a concentration from 0,5 to 1,5 molar with sodium amide NaNH2 , the forming of the salt being followed by detecting the evolved ammonia amount. The solution of sodium salt in THF is then additioned with a predetermined amount of aprotic polar solvent and with l bromo 3 chloro propane or preferably a solution of 1 bromo 3 chloro propane in the aprotic polar solvent. In accordance with the stoichiometry of reaction 1,Scheme 2, l bromo 3 chloro propane and the sodium salt of methyl propargyl ether must be employed in substantially equimolecular amounts. A slight excess of sodium salt can be optionally used. By operating according to the foregoing, product II see Scheme 2 is obtained with high yields 70 85 . In a practical embodiment, reaction 1 of Scheme 2 is accomplished by operating as follows. A predetermined amount of methyl propargyl ether is added to a suspension, in anhydrous THF, of a NaNH2 amount ranging from 1 to 2 moles per mole of ether, at a temperature re of about 10 30 CC. Ammonia evolvement is followed until full conversion of ether into the corresponding sodium salt. This operation can be carried out by indirect titration by bubbling ammonia in a H SO solution of known titre and 24 by re titration of the latter, or by volumetrically measuring the evolved NH which is then removed in acidulated 3 water. The solution of sodium salt in TUF cooled down to 10 OOC is additioned dropwise with a solution of a substantially equimolecular amount, in respect of the sodium salt, of l bromo 3 chloro propane in a predetermined amount ofDMS0 or of HMPA. The reaction exothermy is controlled and, at the conclu sion of the addition, the temperature is allowed to rise up to about 10 OC. The reaction mixture is then treated accord ing to conventional techniques. For example, the mixture is poured into water and it is extracted with an organic solvent Rough product II is obtained by removal of the solvent from the organic extract, such compound being employable for the successive reaction either as such or after purification by distillation. Reaction 2 is carried out by adding, to a solution of sodium salt of 4 decyloxy phenol in a proper inert polar solvent, a substantially equimolecular amount or a slight excess of compound II optionally dissolved in a suitable solvent. The sodium salt of 4 decyloxy phenol is preparable in situ by reacting the corresponding phenol with sodium hydroxide in the same inert polar solvent. A slight heating 600 70 oc helps the course of reaction 2. Generally, about 4 6 hours are required until complete disappearance of the reagents gas chromatographic check . The reaction mixture is treated according to conventional modalities and product I is obtained with yields higher than 90 and with a high purity degree. As compared with the process illustrated in scheme 1, in accordance with European patent application NO 37.092, the process forming the object of the present invention offers several advantages, which can be summarized as follows simple feasibleness the process object of this inven tion is carried out in two steps only and requires the isolation of only one intermediate compound II which, however, needs not necessarily to be purified the pro cess of scheme 1 must be carried out in five steps and requires the isolation of four intermediates compounds A, B, C, and D economy the organic reagents employed in the process ac cording to this invention directly serve to the produc tion of compound I conversely, in the process shown in scheme l, it is necessary to employ organic reagents with different purposes, such as tetrahydropyranyl or equiva lents as a protective group, and p.toluene sulphonyl chlo ride to transform the hydroxy group of compound C into a good leaving group better industrial suitability the process of this inven tion requires, thanks to its simple feasibleness and to the fact that it comprises only two steps , less expensi ve plants and lower investment costs, and it can be easi ly converted to a continuous process The process accord ing to scheme 1, since it comprises five steps and requi res the isolation of four intermediates, necessitates plants of larger dimensions, with consequent high invest ment costs less pollution problems the waste products of the pro cess according to this invention consist of NaBr and NaCl, which do not raise problems connected with the en vironmental pollution as are encountered with the waste products of the process according to scheme 1 tetrahydro pyranyl and sodium p.toluene sulphonate , which, besides, are recoverable only with an excessive increase in costs high yields the process of scheme 1 provides yields low er than 50 as it comprises five steps, none of which being quantitative, and requires the isolation of four in termediates, with consequent yield reduction.The process object of the present invention provides yields of 70 85 in the first step and yields higher than 90 in the se cond step. The following examples are given to better illustrate the present invention.Example 1Preparation of compound 1 methoxy chloro hexyne 2 compound II CH O CH C C CH CH CH C1 12.5 g 0.10 moles of methyl propargyl ether CH2O CH2C CH were gradually added to a suspension of 8 g 0,205 moles of sodium amide NaNH2 in 170 ml of anhydrousTHF, maintained under stirring at room temperature. Evolvement of ammonia was observed. It was moderately heated 30 C until complete evolvement of the theoretic ammonia, whereafter it was cooled to O OC and maintained under stirring at this temperature while a solution of 28.35 g 0.18 moles of l bromo 3 chloro propane Br CH2 CH2 CH2 Cl in 28 ml of DMSO 16.5 by volume referred to THF was added dropwise. The reaction was exothermic. On completion of the addition and of the exothermy, the temperature was allowed to rise up to 10 OC, while going on stirring for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was then poured into water and extracted with ethyl ether 3 x 100 ml . The ethereal extracts were joined, washed with water and dried on anhydrous Na2SO4. The solvent was then removed by evaproration under reduced pressure, thus obtaining a rough product 26 g substantially consisting of product II, that was employable as such for the successive reaction. The rough product was purified by distillation under reduced pressure, and the fraction boiling at 56 C at a pressure of 2 mm Hg was gathered, thus obtaining 19.9 g of product II, which, subjected to gas chromatography, revealed a purity degree of 90 Yield determined on the purified product 76 . 1H NMR CDCl3, TMS ppm 1.95 m, 2H, CH2 CH2Cl 2.4 m, 2H, C CH2 CH2 3.3 s, 3H, CII 3 3.7 t, 2H, CH2 Cl 4 t, 2H, O CH2, J 0.2 s singlet, t triplet, m multiplet or unresolved com ples signal, J coupling constant .Example 2 Preparation of compound II was repeated by operating in like manner as is described in example 1, but varying some parameters. The results of these tests Nos. 1 5 and of two comparative tests Nos. 6 and 7 carried out as in example 1 but without using the aprotic polar solvent, are recorded in the following Table. From the tests reported in said Table it is apparent that the aprotic polar solvent plays a critical role as in its absence the reaction does not provide appreciable yields even if subjected to heating, the l bromo 3 chloro propane compound being recovered practically quantitatively.
