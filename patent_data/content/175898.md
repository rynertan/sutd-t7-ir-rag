# Rapidly solidified nickel aluminide of improved stoichiometry and ductilization.

## Abstract
It has been found that tri nickel aluminide compositions are quite sensitive to the ratio of nickel to aluminum in their ability to receive boron as a dopant and that compositions which are relatively poor in the aluminum component can be doped more effectively with boron. Further, it has been found for the nickel aluminides which have lower concentra tions of aluminum that the percentage of boron which can be added to the composition to effectively increase the strength of the alloys is favored by the lower aluminum ratio so that higher concentrations of boron are addable. The composi tions which result have signiftcant strength properties based on tensile tests of the compositions.
