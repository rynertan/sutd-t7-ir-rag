# Improvements in or relating to telephone circuits, monolithically integrated, for ring trip detection.

## Abstract
A telephone circuit for the ring trip detection, including a current transducer circuit TR that is coupled to a user s telephone line and supplies a current I An integrator INT included in the circuit integrates the current supplied by the transducer on one or more full pe riods of the line voltage. When the result of such an integration is different from zero, the detection circuit can inform the telephone ex change control equipment that the off hook has taken place.
