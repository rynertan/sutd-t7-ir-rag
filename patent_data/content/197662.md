# Pressure sensitive adhesive tape having a substantially tack free surface.

## Abstract
A pressure sensitive adhesive layer is crosslinked be tween carboxyl groups along one surface by polyvalent cations, thus making that surface substantially tack free while leaving at least one broad surface of the layer tacky and pressure sensitive. When a broad surface of the adhe sive layer is thus made completely tack free, the adhesive layer can be wound upon itself in roll form without a backing for convenient storage and shipment. Preferably a low adhesion backsize coating covers the broad tack free surface to insure that the adhesive layer can be unwound after prolonged storage without delaminating.
