## Description
This invention relates generally to an image sensing and processing apparatus and, more particularly, to an electronic image sensing and processing apparatus for providing an enhanced electrical output signal. Electronic image scanning and processing apparatus embodying a charge transfer type of scanning device such as a CCD fabricated in the form of an integrated circuit on a thin silicon semiconductor substrate are well known in the art. It is also well known to utilize such apparatus to scan a subject such as a colour negative or transparency or a positive or a document and process the information derived therefrom to provide a facsimile of the subject in enhanced or corrected colours. Such apparatus senses the subject and introduces a colour correction factor so that each colour has a predetermined density and displays the subject with a corrected colour as disclosed in U.S. A 3,644,664, in which it was recognized that earlier colour analyzing and correction devices were deficient in not taking into account the effect that one colour may have on another colour in determining the degree of colour correction that should be imparted to the image. Toward that end well known colour correction equations are utilized in which each red, green and blue primary colour is corrected as a function of all three primary colours. As is readily apparent, in order to provide such colour correction it is necessary that the red, green and blue colour signals be available at all times despite the fact that the subject is generally scanned through red, green and blue light filter elements with each filter element moved in sequence over the light sensing device. In US A 3,644,664 continuous red, green and blue colour separation signals were obtained through complex circuitry that continuously determined each colour separation signal as a function of the other colour scanned during those intervals in which that colour was not directly scanned. Continuous red, green and blue colour separation signals can also be provided during the sequential red, green and blue colour filter scan of the subject by storing in an image memory those colour signal components scanned through the immediately preceding colour filter in the sequence. Such image memories, however, must have large storage capacities in order to accommodate the large volume of image data that must be stored for each of the two primary colours not being immediately scanned. This capacity requirement must be even further increased when the electronic image data is converted from an analog format to a digital format in order to provide a high quality facsimile of the subject. A similar system is shown in US A 3879750 which describes image scanning and processing apparatus comprising Therefore, it is a primary object of this invention to provide an electronic image sensing and processing apparatus in which the red, green and blue colour separation signals are each enhanced as a function of the other colour separation signals and which utilizes a minimum storage capacity memory. The image sensing and processing apparatus according to one aspect of the present invention is characterized in that the filtering means also senses the complementary yellow, cyan and magenta colours to establish red, green, blue, yellow, cyan and magenta colour components of the electrical output signal includes means for storing the electrical output signal in a memory and in that the photoresponsive and filtering means operate to provide the cyan colour component of the electrical output signal for storage in the memory immediately prior to providing the red colour component of the electrical output signal so as to enable the red colour component to be colour matrixed with the cyan colour component retrieved from the memory the magenta colour component of the electrical output signal for storage in the memory immediately prior to providing the green colour component of the electrical output signal so as to enable the green colour component to be colour matrixed with the magenta colour component retrieved from the memory and the yellow colour component of the electrical output signal for storage in the memory immediately prior to providing the blue colour component of the electrical output signal so as to enable the blue colour component to be colour matrixed with the yellow colour component retrieved from the meory, whereby the memory is required to store only one of the complementery cyan, magenta, or yellow colour components at a time and in that the signal processing means comprises a first arithmetic logic for multiplying respectively the complementary cyan, magenta and yellow colour components of the electrical output signal by a factor of, a second arithmetic logic unit for multiplying respectively the primary red, green and blue colour components of the electrical output signal by a factor, and means for adding the red and cyan colour components of the electrical output signal subsequent to the multiplication to generate the enhanced red colour component, adding the green and magenta colour components of the electrical output signal subsequent to the multiplication to generate the enhanced green colour component, and adding the blue and yellow colour components of the electical output signal subsequent to the multiplication to generate the enhanced blue colour component. With the invention only one of the complementary cyan, magenta and yellow colour components is required to be stored in memory at a time. In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, a method for electronically sensing an image and processing the electronic signal information so sensed, comprises the steps of In order that the invention may be better understood, an example of a method and apparatus embodying the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic block diagram for the image sensing and processing apparatus embodying this invention Figure 2 is a front view of the filter wheel arrangement utilized in the image sensing and processing apparatus of Figure 1 and Figure 3 is a graphical representation for various clock pulse trains provided by various clocks in the image sensing and processing apparatus of Figure 1. Referring now to Figure 1, there is shown a schematic block diagram for an electronic image sensing and processing system which embodies the colour matrix image enhancement feature of this invention. A document, photograph or slide transparency to be electronically sensed and processed is shown generally at 12 in position to be line scanned by a CCD linear image sensor as shown generally at 20. A filter wheel as shown generally at 14 comprising a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart individual light filtering elements is disposed between the subject 12 to be scanned and the linear image sensor 20 so as to filter the image defining light rays sensed by the linear image sensor 20. The linear image sensor 20 comprises a line of light sensor or photoresponsive elements or pixels 1 through N as shown generally at 24. The line of sensor elements 24 is comprised of single crystal silicon in which the image photons create electron hole pairs. The electrons are collected in the individual sensor elements 1 through N , and the holes are swept into the substrate. The amount of charge accumulated in each sensor element 1 through N is a linear function of the incident light and the exposure time, and the output signal charge will vary in an analog manner from a thermally generated noise background at zero illumination to a maximum at saturation under bright illumination. Adjacent one side of the line of image sensor elements 24 there is provided an odd pixel transfer gate 26, and adjacent the other side of the line of image sensor elements 24 there is provided an even pixel transfer gate 28. Adjacent the odd and even pixel transfer gates 26 and 28, there is provided respectively an odd pixel CCD transport shift register 30 and an even pixel CCD transport shift register 32. The transfer of charge from the individual sensor elements 24 to the transport shift registers 30, 32 by way of the transfer gates 26, 28 respectively is controlled by a transfer clock as shown at 50. The charge packets accumulated in the individual sensor elements 24 are transferred into storage wells of respective ones of the odd even pixel transfer gates 26, 28 when the transfer gate clock voltage from the clock 50 goes high. When the transfer gate clock voltage from the clock 50 goes low, the charge packets are transferred from respective storage wells of the odd even pixel transfer gates 26, 28 into corresponding ones of the odd even transport shift registers 30 and 32. Thus, in this manner the odd even pixel transfer gates 26 and 28 operate to control the exposure time for the sensor elements 24. Alternate charge packets transferred to the odd even CCD transport shift registers 30 and 32 are thereafter moved serially to a charge detection diode as shown generally at 34 by a transport clock pulse train provided from a transport clock 52. The charge packets are alternately transported by the transport clock pulse train from the transport clock 52 to the charge detection diode whose potential changes linearly in response to the amount of the signal charge delivered thereto. The potential at the charge detection diode 34 is applied to the input gate of a cascaded source follower MOS amplifier 36 which, in turn, operates to provide an electrical output signal. The charge detection diode 34 is reset before the arrival of each new signal charge packet from the CCD transport shift registers 30 and 32 by a reset clock pulse train provided by a reset clock 54. The phase relationship of the reset clock pulse train provided by the reset clock 54 and the transport clock pulse train provided by the transport clock 52 and the geometric layout of the paths provide for alternate delivery of charge packets to reestablish the original sequence of the linear image data. The electrical output signal from the cascaded source follower MOS amplifier 36, in turn, is directed to an analog to digital converter 38 from which the analog signal is converted to a digital signal for each sensor element. The digitized image data, in turn, is directed to an arithmetic logic unit as shown generally at 40 for multiplication by a constant factor K . In its preferred form the arithmetic logic unit 40 may comprise a lookup table. After multiplication by the constant factor K , the digitized data from the arithmetic logic unit 40 is thereafter directed for storage in an image memory as shown generally at 42 which in its preferred mode may comprise a random access memory RAM . Digitized image data from the analog to digital converter 38 is also directed to another arithmetic logic unit 44 for multiplication by another constant factor 1 2K . Again, the arithmetic logic unit 44 in its preferred form comprises a lookup table. The digital output signal from the arithmetic logic unit 44, in turn, is directed to an adder circuit 46 for combination with the output from the RAM 42. The output signal from the adder 46, in turn, represents an enhanced electrical output signal which may thereafter be directed to a printer 48 from whence an enhanced image facsimile of the subject 12 originally scanned may be provided in the usual manner. The printer 48 may be any conventional well known electronic facsimile recording device such as a thermal printer, a CRT printer, or a laser printer. Referring now to FIG. 2, there is shown the preferred arrangement of this invention for the circumferentially spaced apart filter elements of the filter wheel 14. As is readily apparent from the drawing, the filter wheel 14 comprises the primary colored red, green and blue filter elements alternately disposed with respect to the complementary colored yellow, cyan and magenta filter elements. Image enhancing color correction is provided in the manner of this invention using standard color matrixing in accordance with the following equations where K may typically be in the order of 0.3. B , R and G represent the enhanced electrical color separation signals. These color matrixing equations can be rewritten in terms of the complementary colors yellow, cyan and magenta as follows. Operation of the image sensing and processing system 10 may commence by rotatably driving the filter wheel 14 with a motor 16 into position such that the subject 12 can be line scanned by the linear image sensor 20 through the yellow filter. The line of sensor elements 24 may comprise approximately 1,000 individual sensing elements or pixels and may be moved transversely across the face of the item 12 by the motor 22 in the direction as shown by the arrow A. As previously discussed, electrons are collected in the individual sensor elements and the holes are swept into the substrate such that the amount of charge accumulated in each sensor element is a linear function of the incident light and the exposure time. For reasons that will become apparent from the following discussion, it is preferred that the complementary colors yellow, cyan and magenta be sensed in low resolution equivalent to a 250 x 250 pixel matrix scan. By contrast, the primary colors red, green and blue are sensed at full resolution equivalent to a 1,000 x 1,000 pixel matrix scan. As previously discussed, the transfer clock 50 as shown in FIG. 3 controls the transfer of charge packets from the sensor elements 24 to the transport shift registers 30, 32 and thus the interval between the pulses of the transfer clock pulse train determines the exposure time for each sensing element. The transfer clock pulse train for a full resolution 1,000 x 1,000 pixel matrix scan is shown at A in FIG. 3 along with the accompanying transport and reset clock pulse trains as shown at B and C which control respectively the transport of charge packets from the shift registers 30 and 32 and the resetting of the charge detection diode 34 for each charge packet received from the transport shift registers 30 and 32. The full resolution 1,000 by 1,000 pixel matrix scan may be reduced to a low resolution 250 x 250 pixel matrix scan by changing the transfer clock pulse train and transport clock pulse train as shown at D and E in FIG. 3 while simultaneously increasing the speed of the motor 22 to drive the linear image sensor 20 across the item 12 in the direction of the arrow A at quadruple the speed at which the full resolution 1,000 x 1,000 pixel matrix scan is made. As is readily apparent from FIG. 3, the frequency of the transfer clock pulse train D is also quadrupled so as to provide one quarter the exposure time as that provided by the transfer clock pulse train A. With one quarter the exposure time for each light sensing element there can thus only be accumulated one quarter the charge packets for each light sensing element as would otherwise be accumulated for the transfer clock pulse train A. Thus, each light sensing element accumulates one quarter the charge packets as would otherwise be accumulated during the full resolution scan. The transport clock pulse train frequency in E for the low resolution 250 x 250 pixel matrix scan, in turn, is also quadrupled in comparison to the frequency of the transport clock pulse train B for the full resolution 1,000 x 1,000 pixel matrix scan. Thus, the charge detection diode 34 receives charge packets at four times the rate for the low resolution scan as for the high resolution scan so as to allow the charge packets from four sensing elements to accumulate prior to each reset. Since as previously discussed each sensing element accumulates only one fourth the charge packets it would otherwise accumulate during the full resolution scan, resetting the charge detection diode 34 after receiving the charge packets from four sensing elements operates to provide an analog output value equivalent to the average value of four linear picture sensing elements. Thus, in this manner can low resolution average values be provided for a predetermined number of linear sensing elements. Vertical averaging is provided simply by increasing the vertical scan rate by scanning over four horizontal lines in the same time as a single horizontal line scan would otherwise be made. Thus, in this manner can a low resolution 250 x 250 pixel matrix scan be made. The subject 12 is thus fully line scanned through the yellow filter to provide a low resolution analog electrical output signal from the cascaded source follower MOS amplifier 36 to the analog to digital converter 38. The analog electrical output signal, in turn, is converted to a digitized signal and thereafter directed to the arithmetic logic unit 40 in which the digitized data is multiplied by the factor K . The modified output signal from the arithmetic logic unit 40 is thereafter directed to the RAM 42 for temporary storage. The filter wheel 14 is thereafter incrementally rotated so as to bring the blue filter into position between the subject 12 and linear image sensor 20 for the next line scan operation. As previously discussed, the line scan through the blue filter element is conducted at full resolution to provide the 1,000 x 1,000 pixel matrix scan utilizing the transfer clock pulse train A and the transport clock pulse train B of FIG. 3. As previously discussed, the motor 22 is operated at one quarter the speed previously utilized during the line scan through the yellow filter element to provide the full resolution output. The electrical output signal from the cascaded source follower MOS amplifier 36, in turn, is directed to the analog to digital converter 38 for conversion to a digital signal which, in turn, is directed to the arithmetic logic unit 44 for multiplication by the factor 1 2K . The output signal for each pixel from the arithmetic logic unit 44, in turn, is added to the output signal for the corresponding low resolution pixel retrieved from the RAM 42 representative of the previous line scan through the yellow filter. Thus, the adder 46 provides an enhanced output blue color signal in accordance with the first modified color matrix equation. The enhanced blue color signal may be thereafter directed to the printer 48 to print the blue primary color in the usual manner. The filter wheel 14 is next incrementally rotated by the motor 16 to move the cyan filter into position between the subject 12 and image sensor 20 in order to enable the next line scan to be made through the cyan filter element. As previously discussed, the line scan through the cyan filter element is made at the low resolution 250 x 250 pixel matrix scan utilizing the transfer clock pulse train D and transport clock pulse train E of FIG. 3. The low resolution video signal is converted from an analog to digital value in the aforementioned manner by the analog to digital converter 38 and thereafter directed to the arithmetic logic unit 40 for multiplication by the factor K . The low resolution cyan video signal is thereafter stored in the RAM 42. The filter wheel is thereafter incrementally rotated by the motor 16 so as to move the red filter element into position between the subject 12 and the image sensor 20 so as to enable the next line scan to be made through the red filter element. As previously discussed, the line scan of the subject 12 through the red filter element is made at the full resolution 1,000 x 1,000 pixel matrix scan using the transfer clock pulse train A and transport clock pulse train B of FIG. 3. The high resolu tion output video signal from the cascaded source follower MOS amplifier 36 is converted by the analog to digital converter 38 to a digital value and thereafter multiplied by the factor 1 2K by the arithmetic logic unit 44. The multiplied output signal for each pixel from the arithmetic logic unit 44, in turn, is added to the cyan signal for each corresponding low resolution pixel previously stored in the RAM 42. The output from the adder 46 thus provides an enhanced red color signal in accordance with the second modified color matrix equation. The enhanced red color signal is thereafter utilized in the usual manner by the printer 48 to print the red color component of the hard copy. The filter wheel 14 is thereafter incrementally rotated by the motor 16 to drive the magenta filter element into position between the subject 12 and the image sensor 20. The image sensor 20 thereafter completes another line scan of the subject 12 at the aforementioned low resolution 250 x 250 pixel matrix scan utilizing the transfer clock pulse train D and the transport clock pulse train E of FIG. 3. The low resolution video output signal from the cascaded source follower MOS amplifier 36 is thereafter converted to a digital signal by the analog to digital converter 38. The digitized signal, in turn, is directed for multiplication by the factor K by the arithmetic logic unit 40 from whence it is transferred for storage in the RAM 42. The filter wheel is thereafter incrementally driven by the motor 16 to move the green filter element into position between the subject 12 to be line scanned and the linear image sensor 20. The image sensor 20 thus line scans the item 12 through the green filter element to provide a high resolution 1,000 x 1,000 pixel matrix scan utilizing the transfer clock pulse train A and the transport clock pulse train B of FIG. 3. The high resolution video signal, in turn, is converted by the A D converter 38 to a digital signal and thereafter multiplied by the factor 1 2K by the arithmetic logic unit 44. The digital output signal for each pixel modified by the factor 1 2K is thereafter added to the previously sensed magenta digital signal for each corresponding low resolution pixel from the RAM 42 to provide an enhanced green output signal in the manner of the third line of the modified color matrix equations. The enhanced green color signal is thereafter directed to the printer 48 for printing in the usual manner of the green colored component of the hard copy. In this manner, color matrixing can be accomplished in a simple and economical manner utilizing a minimum capacity memory, i.e., RAM 42, having sufficient memory to hold digital image data for only a 250 x 250 pixel array. This minimum capacity memory may be utilized to achieve color matrixing as a direct result of the independent sensing of the primary red, green and blue color components as well as the yellow, cyan and magenta complementary color components of the image. Thus, the arrangement of filter elements to sense both the primary red, green add blue color components as well as the complementary colored yellow, cyan and magenta components enables color matrixing image enhancement to be accomplished while storing only one of the complementary color components at a time. In addition, sensing the complementary color components in low resolution in comparison to the high resolution in which the primary red, green and blue color components are sensed operates to further reduce the memory capacity storage requirements for the random access memory RAM 42.
