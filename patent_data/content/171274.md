# Photovoltaic device having long term energy conversion stability and method of producing same.

## Abstract
An amorphous semiconductor photoresponsive device in cluding small amounts of p type dopant in the photo active region to reduce the annealing temperature of the device. Such low annealing temperature photovoltaic devices may be incor porated into modules designed to operate at temperatures sufficient to anneal light induced defects periodically or con tinuously, to improve long term energy conversion efficiency stability.
