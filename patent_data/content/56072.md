# Multiplexer for single octave data processor.

## Abstract
Multiplexing means for allowing multi octave process ing of sampled data by means of a common single octave data processor. Sampled data is preselectively delayed, corresponding to delay coding thereof, and multiplex switching means samples the progessively delayed delay coded data at progressively reduced data sampling rates, corresponding to lower octaves of interest. In this way the several octaves of data are interleaved or time multiplexed. Similar multiplexing within the single octave data processor corresponds to frequency multiplexing of the time multiplexed multi octave date, whereby the single band width limit processor may handle such multiple octave data.
