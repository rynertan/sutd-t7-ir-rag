# Surgical retractor elements and assembly.

## Abstract
Surgical retractor elements and assemblies are de scribed for holding open a surgical incision to expose the surgical area and to keep uninvolved tissues away from the surgical area without causing undue trauma to the engaged tissues. A self retaining form includes a ring 120 and a plurality of paddle assemblies 122 angularly spaced about the ring 120 for engaging and holding back uninvolved tissues. The paddle assemblies 122 have arms 140 that slide radialiy through a slot 129 in the ring 120 . Each of the retractor assemblies includes a paddle 142 of a soft, resilient flexible material for flexing to prevent stress con centrations. The paddies 142 have a flexural modulus of elasticity between 1,000 psi and 75,000 psi. One form of paddle 142 is provided to slidabiy fit over the existing blade of a hand held retractor. Another form of assembly includes a soft, resilient paddle mounted to a hand held handle frame. The handle includes two angularly offset gripping sections that can be comfortably gripped and held by an assistant for lang periods of time.

## Description
This invention relates to surgical devices and more particularly to surgical retractor paddles and associated elements used to hold an incision open and to hold back retract adjacent tissues e.g. bowel allowing exposure of organ s requiring surgery. Over the years numerous types of surgical retractors have been developed to hold an incision open during the surgical operation by holding uninvolved tissue including skin, fat, muscle, nerves and organs behind various types of blades or paddles a cavity being produced in which a surgical procedure can be executed with the required good vision for precise technique. Retractors are also used to hold the border of the incision stable. Many of the retractors have included a ring or circular element.Several angularly positioned paddle shaped retractor elements mount to the ring element and project into the incision to hold the incision open and to barricade the invasion of uninvolved tissues into the surgical cavity. Several retractor arms have been constructed that allow adjustment of the opening of the incision. Such arms may be adjusted by tightening or loosening some type of screw or clamp elements that are fixed to the ring portion. Examples of such retractors are illustrated in U. S. Patents 2,623,517, granted to I.O. Barlow et al on December 30, 1952 2,893,378, granted to R.L. Cooper on July 7, 1959 3,040,739, granted to H.R.Grieshaber on June 26, 1962 and 3,384,078, granted to W.K. Gauthier onMay 21, 1968. Several of the surgical retractors have been of the self retaining type. Included is a paddle or hook with a lip that extends outward underneath the body tissues. The paddle maintains the retractor in position and prevents the retractor from migrating during the surgical process. Examples of such paddle elements are illustrated in U.S. Patents 2,623,517 mentioned above and 3,394,700, granted to Hideo Yamamoto July 30, 1968. The typical retractor paddle is formed of a stainless steel or reinforced plastic material that has a curved surface for engaging the body tissues.An example of such a blade or paddle is illustrated in U.S. Patent 3,384,078 above mentioned . The devices described above have been known to press upon nerves, producing damage and paralysis. Additionally, the surgeon must be careful, when expanding the incision to not trap bowel or body organs beneath the edges of the paddles or hooks. Otherwise the tissue might be damaged.Additionally, the paddles are rigid and unforgiving, placing substantial stress concentration on the body tissues. The potential for trauma is thereby increased and may increase the recovery time for the patient. In the United States millions of surgeries are performed each year utilizing surgical retractors. A savings of one day of recovery time would represent a very significant decrease in the cost of hospitalization and patient discomfort . Additionally, absorbent cotton materials called sponges are generally used in conjunction with surgical retractors to pack away uninvolved tissues so as to not impede the progress of the operation. Sponges can contribute to tissue dehydration. Sponges are occasionally left in the abdomen after the surgery is completed and the incision closed. Sponge retention often causes severe complications. Furthermore, sponges are carriers of a variable degree of lint. Lint alone, when retained in the abdominal cavity can cause irritation, inflammation, and adhesions which may result in prolonged discomfort, or severe complications. One of the principal objects of this invention is to provide surgical retractor elements that are capable of engaging and holding back the uninvolved body tissues from the site or locus of the operation while minimizing stress concentrations on the abdominal wall and materially reducing the potential for trauma to tissues held out of the surgical cavity by the retractor paddle. A further object of this invention is to provide stable surgical retractor elements that are capable of being readily manipulated and adjusted by the surgeon or an assistant. A further object of this invention is to provide versatile surgical retractor elements which permit a reduction in members of the surgical team.Additionally, fewer assistants may be required which reduces the surgical costs. A further object of this invention is to provide surgical retractor elements that are capable of significantly reducing body tissue trauma and thereby reduce recovery and hospitalization time. A further advantage of this invention is to provide surgical retractor elements that are highly adjustable, enabling the system to be utilized on a wide variety of patients having a wide diversity in flesh thickness and body cavity depth. A still further object of this invention is to provide surgical retractor elements that reduce the need for sponges. These and other objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent upon reading the following detailed description. The present invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a pictorial view of a paddle for mounting to an existing form of retractor Fig. 2 is a side elevation of the paddle shown in Fig. 1 mounted to an existing form of hand held retractor Fig. 3 is a rear view of the paddle and retractor shown in Fig. 2 Fig. 4 is a side view of a hand held form of the retractor assembly Fig. 5 is a cross sectional fragmentary detail view of a portion of the assembly taken along line 5 5 in Fig. 4 Fig. 6 is a top plan view of the assembly shown in Fig. 4 Fig. 7 is a plan view of a self retaining surgical retractor showing present retractor elements and a retractor assembly utilized in conjunction with abdominal surgery on a patient Fig. 8 is a vertical cross sectional schematic view taken along line 8 8 in Fig. 7 illustrating a lateral paddle assembly Fig.9 is a vertical cross sectional schematic view taken along line 9 9 in Fig. 7 illustrating a polar paddle assembly Fig. 10 is a vertical cross sectional schematic view taken along line 10 10 in Fig. 7 illustrating a lap paddle assembly Fig. 11 is a vertical cross sectional view taken along line 11 11 in Fig.7 illustrating a one directional adjustment locking mechanism Fig. 12 is a view similar to Fig. 11 showing the release of the locking mechanism Fig. 13 is a vertical cross sectional view taken along line 13 13 in Fig.9 illustrating a vertical adjustment mechanism for adjusting the paddles with respect to the patient Fig. 14 is an isometric view of a lateral paddle member illustrated inFig. 8 Fig. 15 is a horizontal cross sectional view taken along line 15 15 inFig. 14 Fig. 16 is an isometric view of a polar paddle member illustrated in Fig.9 Fig. 17 is a horizontal cross sectional view taken along line 17 17 inFig. 16 Fig. 18 is an isometric view of a lap paddle member illustrated in Fig.10 and Fig. 19 is a cross sectional view taken along line 19 19 in Fig. 18. Several forms of the present surgical retractor elements and assembly are shown in the accompanying drawings. Specifically, Figs. 1 through 3 show one form of the present retractor paddle that is adapted to be mounted on a conventional hand held retractor. Figs. 4 through 6 show a form of the present hand held retractor assembly, including a hand held frame and paddle. A form of the present assembly is also shown in conjunction with a self retaining retractor assembly in Figs. 7 through 19. All forms of the present retractor elements and assemblies are intended for surgical use on an animal or human body 13 Figs. 4, 7, and 8 through 10 to hold a surgical incision open. The primary object of the retractor elements and assemblies is to hold the incision open, allowing a surgeon to effectively and efficiently perform a surgical procedure within a surgical area 14. As shown in Fig. 7, the incision is made in the abdominal area of the body 13. The present retractor elements and assemblies operate to hold back body tissues adjacent the incision. For purposes of this disclosure, the purposely generalized term t tissuesn will be taken to include body wall flesh 16 including skin, fat, muscle, and nerve tissues and the body viscera 18. One form of a retractor paddle element of the present invention is shown particularly in Figs 1 through 3 at 10. This particular element of the present invention is adapted for mounting to conventional hand held retractors such as that shown at 20 in Fig. 2. Conventional hand held retractors 20 may be formed either of an integral handle 21 and blade 23 as shown, or can include a solid cast handle and a stiff wire blade not shown . In surgery, the blade is inserted into an incision and is positioned adjacent tissues desired to be held away from the surgical area 14. The task of holding the blade in place and providing sufficient force against the blade to hold the uninvolved tissues away from the area 14 is typically assigned to an assistant. Often several such retractors are used, along with an equal number of assistants. Also, such hand held retractors are commonly used in conjunction with self retaining retractors for specific, localized applications within the surgical area. The illustrated paddle 10 includes a body 24 formed entirely of a soft, resilient, non metallic, non absorbent material such as urethane, vinyl, rubber or other appropriate material. The material is scissile, allowing the surgeon to quickly and easily cut the paddle into any size or configuration desired. The material used for the paddle 10 and for the other paddle forms shown and described below is soft and flexible with an operable flexural modulus of elasticity range between 1,000 psi and 75,000 psi. Preferably, however, the range is between 2,000 psi and 20,000 psi. The operable softness durometer range of the material is softer than D 69 Shore but harder than A 20 Shore. The preferable range, however, is softer thanA 99 Shore and harder than A 60 Shore. The material is thus sufficiently soft and resilient to allow the paddle body 24 to bend into an arc, evenly distributing forces to the engaged tissue without producing stress concentrations that would otherwise be likely to damage or traumatize the affected tissues. The paddle body 24 includes a front face 25 that is adapted to engage body tissues including the body wall flesh 16 and viscera 18. The body 24 also has a back face 26 that is adapted to face inwardly toward the surgical area 14. The faces 25 and 26 extend to peripheral side edges 27. The edges 27 are preferably upright and joined by a peripheral top edge 28 and an opposed bottom edge 29. The paddle body 24 includes a thickness dimension between the front and back faces that decreases from the central portion toward side edges 27.The thickness dimension preferably decreases toward the bottom edge 29.The decreasing paddle thickness feature, coupled with the material characteristics described above, allow the body 24 to deflect resiliently into two dimensional arcs between edges 27 and edges 28 and 29 in response to forces applied thereto. The body 24 includes one or more thick central sections 30 and thin peripheral skirt sections 31 leading to the edges 27 and 29. The thin peripheral sections are scissile, allowing the surgeon to cut the paddle to any desired shape or size according to need. The thick central sections 30 include means at 32 along the back face of the body adapted to mount a retractor frame, such as the retractor blade 23 of Fig. 2. A vertical slot 34 is formed lengthwise through the thick central sections 30 of a shape that is complementary to the cross sectional configuration of the blade 23. The blade 23 is thus slidably received through the aligned slots 34. The resilient material conforms intimately to the curvature of the blade with the peripheral sections 31 at the sides projecting laterally of the blade sides and the skirt section 31 at the bottom projecting downwardly beyond the paddle end. The blade end is received in a bottom closed pocket 35 of the means 32. The central portions 30 of the paddle will conform to and are reinforced by the blade 23. The peripheral sections 31, however, are allowed to flex resiliently about the retractor blade.The thin sections 31 are able to bend sharply about short radii and at angles approaching 900 to the normal planar orientation of the faces.This flexural give eliminates stress concentrations that would otherwise occur at the rigid edges of the conventional blade 23. It is understood that the retractor 20 shown herein is merely one of many conventional forms currently in use. It should be understood, however, that the present paddle structure is sufficiently resilient and pliable to fit over many blade configurations. Furthermore, the paddle 10 can also be produced with varying shape and size slots 34 to conform to virtually any retractor blade structure. Figs. 4 through 19 show modified forms of the paddle described above for use as an element of 1 a novel hand held retractor assembly 40 Figs.4 through 6 and 2 a novel self retaining retractor assembly 100 Figs. 7 through 19 . In such embodiments, the paddles are preferably included as elements of retractor assemblies 40 or 100. The paddles 10 themselves, however, are adjustably mounted to respective mounting means for vertical adjustment as will be described below. The hand held retractor assembly 40 basically includes an integral paddle mounting arm 41 and hand grip handle 42. Assembly 40 allows a surgical assistant to comfortably hold an incision open for extended periods of time without the usual accompanying fatigue so often associated with conventional hand held retractors. The paddle 39 of this embodiment is nearly identical with the form shown in Figs. 1 through 3 with the exception that a single elongated central thickened section 43 may be provided in place of the several sections 30 of the Fig. 1 through 3 version. The mounting arm 41 Fig. 4 includes a horizontal section 45 and an upright section 46 for mounting the paddle 39. The two sections are shown at right angles. However, it is understood that other angular relationships acute or obtuse might be utilized as well. The upright section 46 may include an adjustable mounting means not shown that is similar to that shown in detail by Fig. 13 and described below for the self retaining retractor 100. Section 46 mounts the paddle 39 to the mounting arm 41 for vertical adjustment thereon. Effective penetration of the paddle into the body cavity can thus be varied according to need. More detailed description of a similar adjusting means will be given in conjunction with the description of the self retaining retractor 100 below. The hand grip handle 42 includes a first handle section 48 leading up and outwardly from the arm 41. A second handle section 49 projects downward from the section 48. It is preferable that the first handle section 48 form an obtuse angle with the horizontal section 45 of paddle mounting arm 41. It is also preferable that the second handle section 49 be substantially perpendicular to the first section 48. The first handle section 48 provides a hand grip surface 50. The surface 50 facilitates a comfortable grip by one of an assistant s hands. The second handle member likewise has a hand grip surface 51 grasped by the other of the assistant s hands. The perpendicular relationship of the grip surfaces to each other and to the arm 41 allows orientation for superior mechanical advantages of the assistant s hands to assure a firm grip on the retractor and to lessen fatigue. A hand stop 52 is provided between the first and second handle sections 48, 49 to abut with the hand gripping the first section. The stop 52 is shaped along the surface 53, facing section 48, to conform to the side of a user s hand. Fig. 5 shows the enlarged area of the abutment surface 53. A side of stop 52 opposite surface 53 includes a thumb brace surface 54. The thumb brace surface 54 faces the second section 49 to provide a surface against which a user s thumb may comfortably rest. The surface 54 is preferably concave to conform to the surface of the thumb Fig. 6 . Opposite the thumb brace surface 54 and at a remote end of the handle is another hand stop 56 Fig.4 . The side of the user s other hand bears against the stop 56. The stop 56 effectively prevents the hand from slipping off the handle surface 51. Consequently, the assistant s hand against the surface 51 may be rather relaxed. The stop 56 is hook shaped and extends down and inward to engage the side of the user s hand. The self retaining form of the surgical retractor assembly 100 Figs. 7 12 includes a circumscribing or annular frame or ring member 120 that is made of a rather rigid material for circumscribing the surgical area 14. The frame preferably has a modulus of elasticity greater than 300,000 psi. The retractor 100 further includes a plurality of paddle assemblies 122 that are operably mounted to the ring member 120. The assemblies 122 are angularly spaced about the surgical area 14 for engaging uninvolved tissues.The paddle assemblies 122 serve to maintain the incision open without the aid of an assistant and to facilitate surgical operations without interference from uninvolved tissues. Preferably, the ring member 120 is made as a unitary member with an upper ring plate 124 Figs. 8 12 and a lower ring plate 125 vertically separated by angularly spaced ribs 127 shown by dotted line in Fig. 7. The ribs 127 are preferably quite narrow so that an annular slot 129 Figs. 8 10 of substantially 3600 is formed between the upper plate 124 and the lower plate 125. The ribs 127 provide rigid support between the plates 124 and 125. The annular slot 129 extends from an inner face 135 Figs. 8 10 of the ring member 120 to an outer face 136. The annular slot 129 is capable of receiving a plurality of paddle assemblies 122. Each of the paddle assemblies 122 includes an arm frame member 140 and a paddle 142 Fig. 7 10 . The arm frame member 140 includes a horizontal section 144 that extends radially through the annular slot 129 in a close sliding fit between the top and bottom ring members 124, 125. In a preferred embodiment, the horizontal section 144 has a substantially rectangular cross section so that the paddle assemblies 122 will not rotate about the horizontal section 144. Each horizontal section 144 extends from an outer end 145 to an inner end 146. The inner end 146 forms part of a bend that is integral with an upright section 148. The section 148 extends downward to a terminal lower end 150 Figs 8 10 and 13 . The bend illustrated forms an acute angle between the horizontal section 144 and the upright section 148. Preferably the acute angle is between 750 and 850 so the paddle 142 will extend downward and outward with respect to the surgical area 14. It is noted that though the above angular range is preferred, in some operations other angles are envisioned, including obtuse angles. A preferred retractor 100 has three general types of paddles. Such paddles 142 include lateral paddle members 152 Figs. 7, 8, 14 and 15 that are positioned laterally from the axis of the incision or at the 900 and 2700 positions with respect to the axis of the body when abdominal surgery is being performed as illustrated in Fig. 7. The paddles 142 may include polar paddle members 155 Figs. 7, 9, 16 and 17 that may be positioned perpendicularly to the lateral paddle members 152. Additionally, paddles 142 may include lap paddle members 154 Figs. 7, 10, 18 and 19 that are interposed between the lateral members 152 and the polar members 155 depending upon the type of operation.When a rather large incision is made in the abdominal area the lap paddle members 154 may be positioned intermediate the lateral members 152 and the polar members 155 at the 450 position, the 1350 position, and the 3150 position. It should be noted that when all of the paddle members 152, 154 and 155 are utilized, a substantially 3600 enclosure is formed which may be referred to as a coffer dam to minimize the intrusion of body viscera 18 into the surgical area.Consequently, the need for sponges is greatly reduced and possibly eliminated. It is preferred that each of the paddles 142, like paddles 10 and 39, are formed of a non metallic soft, resilient material that is scissile and capable of being deformed or flexed to conform to the tissues about the periphery of the incision. The paddles 142 are preferably interchangeable with the paddle members 39 shown in Figs. 4 6. The paddles 10, 39 and 142 have the same physical material properties. The paddle members will thus conform and flexibly deflect in response to the contours and tensions of the body tissues. The paddle material will conform in response to the reactive forces placed upon the paddles as the paddle assemblies 122 are moved radially outward to spread the incision open and to maintain the surgical area unobstructed. Each of the paddles 142 includes a body 157 Figs. 7, 8 10, 14, 16 and 18 having a front face 156 that is adapted to engage the body wall flesh 16 and viscera 18. The body 157 has a back face 158 that faces the surgical area 14. The front face 156 and the back face 158 extend outwardly to peripheral side edges 160, a peripheral top edge 161 and a peripheral bottom edge 162. The paddle members 142 have a decreasing thickness from the central portion toward the side edges 160. The paddle members 142 will thus deflect in a curved arc in response to the reactive forces placed on the front face 156. During use the front face 156 forms a substantial arc between the peripheral side edges 160 with the pressures being distributed over the front face 156 to minimize stress concentrations. The peripheral side edges 160 are rather thin and quite pliable to enable the edges 160 to progressively bend in arcs having small radii of curvature to minimize and prevent stress concentrates along the peripheral edges 160. The back face 158 includes an enlarged section 164 that has a vertical slot 165 formed therein for slidably receiving the vertical section 148 of the arm member 140. Each of the lateral paddle members 152 includes a rather thick central section 166 and thin peripheral sections 167 leading to the peripheral side edges 160. The lateral paddle members 152 include a retaining projection 168 that extends outward from the front face 156 terminating in a leading edge 170.The retaining projections 168 include side edges 172 and 173 that extend rearward from the leading edge to the central section 166. The retaining projection 168 has a top surface 174 and a bottom surface 175. The retaining projection 168 is designed to extend outward from the incision into the body cavity intermediate the body wall flesh 16 and the body viscera 18.The top surface 174 is intended to engage the body wall flesh 16. The retaining projection 168 holds the retractor 10 within the incision and prevents the retractor 10 from being ejected or dislodged from the incision.The lateral paddle 152 includes a very minimal skirt 176 that extends downward a slight distance from the retaining projection 168. The lateral paddle members 152 are principally designed to maintain the incision in an open position against the tension of the body wall flesh with the retaining projection 168 securing the retractor 100 within the incision.In response to the tension of the tissues the front face 156 of the lateral member 152 forms an arc against the body wall flesh 16 as illustrated in Fig. 7 to eliminate points of stress concentration. The degree of arc is dependent upon the width of retraction relative to incision length.Frequently, the lateral paddle members of conventional retractors press against nerve elements such as the femoral cutaneous nerves and it is very important that undue stress concentrations be minimized to prevent nerve damage. The lateral member 152 illustrated in Fig. 14 has a radius 178 between the central section 166 and the peripheral section 167 so that the peripheral side sections 167 may readily bend in arcs to prevent sharp stress concentrations adjacent the edges and thus avoid nerve damage or damage to other adjacent tissues. The polar paddle members 155 Figs. 16 and 17 include a central section 180 with a peripheral section 181 extending outward to the peripheral side edges 160 and the peripheral bottom edge 162 as illustrated in Figs. 16 and 17. The polar paddle members 155 include a retaining projection 182 that extends outward from the central section 180 to a leading edge 184.Preferably, the retaining projection 182 is considerably shorter than the retaining projection 168. The retaining projection 182 has side edges 186 and 187 extending rearward from the leading edge to the central section 180 forming a top surface 188 and a bottom surface 189. The top surface 188 is intended to fit immediately underneath the body wall flesh 16 as illustrated in Fig. 9. The polar paddle members 155 each include a skirt section 190 Figs. 9 and 16 that extends downwardly a substantial distance from the projection 182 for bearing against the body viscera to hold the organs from the surgical area 14. As illustrated in Figs. 16 and 17, the polar paddle members 155 each have a radius 191 formed in the front face 156 between the central section 180 and the peripheral section 181. The radius 191 substantially decreases the thickness of the polar paddle members 155 adjacent the peripheral side edges 160 and the bottom edges 162. It should be noted that the peripheral sections 181 adjacent the bottom edges 162 are capable of bending at least 900 without breaking so that the bottom edges 162 do not press dangerously against any nerve, vein, artery, ureter, or other body tissue elements.This feature is very important in preventing nerve and tissue damage, blood clots, arterial occlusion, or kidney obstruction via the ureteral drainage conduit. Each of the lap paddle members 154, illustrated in Figs. 18 and 19, includes a central section 192 and a peripheral section 193 extending outward from the central section to the peripheral side edges 160 and bottom edge 162. Preferably the lap paddle members 154 are without any retaining projections and are principally designed to interlace between the lateral paddle members 152 and the polar paddle members 155 to engage and maintain the body viscera 18 from the surgical area 14. Each member 154 has a skirt 195 that extends downward a substantial distance into the body cavity to provide a barrier to the body viscera. A radius 194 is formed on the back face 158 of each lap paddle member 154 so that the peripheral side edges 160 thereof may overlap the adjacent peripheral side edges of the adjacent lateral paddle member 152 and polar paddle member 155 as illustrated in Fig. 7.The peripheral sections 167, 181 and 193 substantially overlap and form a sliding seal to reduce the exposed tissue surface area and resulting dehydration. It should be noted that not all operations will require the use of the lap paddle members 154. However, they are quite useful, as are the other paddle forms, particularly as a substitute for sponges. They help prevent the loss of sponges within the body cavity and complications from lint deposition. Additionally, the paddles do not absorb body liquids as do sponges , but leave the tissues in a more natural state with less dehydration. Such attributes provide for quicker patient recovery. Each of the paddle assemblies 122 and the hand held retractor 40 described above includes a vertical adjusting means 196, Fig. 13 for vertically adjusting the paddle members 142 with respect to the arm members 140. Such a feature is illustrated in Fig. 13. The vertical adjusting means 196 includes rigid detent projections 198 formed on side edges of the vertical arm sections 148. Complementary series of recesses 200, formed in the vertical slots 165, enable the detent projections 198 to be received therein.Together they secure the paddle members 142 at a variety of desired elevations with respect to the horizontal arm sections 144. As illustrated inFig. 13, the detent projections 198 extend below the enlarged sections 164 when the paddle member is located in uppermost position. The paddle assemblies 122, being two separate pieces, 142 and 140, allow the use of different length paddle members 142 providing additional vertical adjustment. Each of the paddle assemblies 122 further includes radial adjustment means 202 Figs. 11 and 12 for enabling the paddle assemblies 122 to be quickly and easily radially adjusted with respect to the ring member 120.Preferably the radial adjustment means 202 includes a releasable one directional locking means 204 that operatively interconnects the horizontal section 144 of the arm member 140 and the ring member 120. The locking means 204 preferably includes a series of ratchet teeth 206 formed in the upper surface of the horizontal section 144 adjacent to the outer end 145. Each of the ratchet teeth 206 includes an abutment surface 207 that is preferably inclined inward toward the inner end 146, forming an acute angle of approximately 850 with the horizontal section 144 of the arm member 140 and an inclined or ramp surface 209 that faces outward towards the outer end 145. A wide groove 210 is formed between the teeth 206. The wide groove 210 allows pivotal movement of the arm assemblies 122.The grooves 210 and the teeth 206 are preferably formed in arcs with respect to the center of the ring member 120 so that the arm members may slide circumferentially without releasing the locking means 204. The locking means 204 further includes a plurality of biased pawls 212 Figs. 7, 11 and 12 that are positioned about the outer face 136 of the ring memberl20. The biased pawls 212 are adjacent to each other and interconnected to the main portion of the upper ring plate 124 through a flexible web section 213. The web section 213 biases the pawls 212 downwardly to engage the teeth 206. The pawls 212 and the teeth 206 are designed so that the paddle assemblies 122 may be moved outwardly very easily by merely applying a radial force on the paddle assemblies 122 causing the horizontal section 144 to slide outward in the annular slot 129. The pawls 212 ride up the inclined surfaces 209 and then fall downwardly into the grooves 210 immediately adjacent the abutment surfaces 207. The pawls 212 have contact surfaces 208 that engage the abutment surface 207.Contact surfaces 208 are formed at acute angles of approximately 850 in relation to the lower surface of the upper ring plate 124. Such angled faces 208 mate with the angled abutment faces 207, enhancing the security of the locking means 204. When the desired position is reached the pawls engage themselves and the mating surfaces prevent the paddle assemblies 122 from moving radially inward unless the locking means 204 is intentionally released It should be noted that the biased pawls 212 are sufficiently close to each other to enable an arm 140 to be moved circumferentially about the center of the ring member 120 from one pawl 212 to an adjacent one without releasing the arm 140 or enabling the arm 140 to move inwardly.Such a feature provides a great deal of versatility and enables a surgeon or his assistant to readily adapt the angular positions of the paddle assemblies 122 to a particular circumstance and portion of the body. This can be done without having to first release the paddle assembly 122, move the paddle assemblies and then reset the locking means. It should be particularly noted with respect to Fig. 7 that the paddle members 142 form a substantially uniform arc and curvature with the front faces 156 of paddles 142 minimizing or preventing the formation of stress concentrations at the edges 160 of the paddle 142. Experimental evidence indicates that the present retractor elements and assemblies described above substantially reduce body tissue trauma and minimize the damage to nerves which may cause paralysis. It appears that the recovery rate of patients enjoying the experimental use of the present invention is enhanced. Experimental evidence also shows that the present retractor elements and assemblies, compared to conventional instruments, greatly aid the surgeon in significantly decreasing the amount of time and the number of assistants required for surgery, particularly on very obese patients. It should be understood that the above description is simply illustrative of the principles of this invention and that numerous other embodiments or modifications thereof may be devised that fall within the scope of the invention set forth by the following claims.
