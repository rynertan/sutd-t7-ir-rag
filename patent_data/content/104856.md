# Hinge assembly.

## Abstract
A hinge assembly for a lid 16 for a container 10 consists of a pivot pin 26 secured to the lid 16 and which is rotatably mounted at its end in recesses 18 formed inside the container. The pivot pin 26 is retained in the recesses 18 by an abutment member 20 formed inside the contain er 10 , the abutment member 20 being deflectable to permit the pivot pin 26 to be inserted into or withdrawn from the recesses 18 . The abutment member 20 is moulded as part of the container 10 and is shaped so that no movable cores are required for the moulding tool resulting in a low cost arrangement.
