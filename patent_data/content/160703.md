# MAGNETIC FIELD GENERATING THERAPEUTIC APPLIANCE.

## Abstract
Magnetic field generating therapeutic appliance which applies an alternating magnetic field to the body to promote the circulation of the blood, thereby relieving such condi tons as stiffness or pain in parts of the body. A typical conventional therapeutic appliance of this type has a magne tic field generator housed within a case and is adapted to be operated manually by the person being treated, or a third person, to apply an alternating magnetic field to the affected parts. The prior art appliance of this type cannot provide a satisfactory magnetic therapeutic effect because of the narrow working range of the fluctuating field and the small magnetic field intensity. In addition, since it is necessary to move the therapeutic appliance to operate it, its operation is not easy. According to this invention, a plurality case 2 each housing a magnetic field generator 1 are connected to form a pivotted chain, and the cases 2 at either end are provided with connecting members 3 , 4 , respectively, which can be connected to each other. According to this invention, the therapeutic appliance can be wound and secured around the affected part, and there is no need for special operations during the therapy such as moving the appliance. Moreover, the fluctuating field produced by each magnetic field gener ator 1 acts strongly over a wide range, including the affected part, thereby increasing the magnetic therapeutic effect.
