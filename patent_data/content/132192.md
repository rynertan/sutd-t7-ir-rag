# Self adjusting pipe clamp and coupling.

## Abstract
A segmented coupling for use in sealing adjacent pipe ends includes coupling segments having bolting pads at their ends, the ends of the coupling segments including inclined end faces for cooperation with correspondingly inclined end faces of an adjacent coupling segment to produce self adjustment of the coupling and rigid clamping of the pipe ends upon tightening down of the coupling.
