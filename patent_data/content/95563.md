# Opto optical light deflector.

## Abstract
An opto optical light deflector modulator has means 14, 16, 18, 20 for providing first 10 and second 12 coherent wave fronts of wavelength λ₀ to travel in a trans parent optical acitve medium 22 to produce an optically generated standing wave that induces a periodic refractive index variation in the medium suitable for diffraction pur poses. The device also includes means 24 for providing a third wavefront λ₁ to travel in said medium which is dif fracted by the periodic refractive index variation induced by the first and second wavefronts.
