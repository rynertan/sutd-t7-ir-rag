# Fastener.

## Abstract
An improved fastener 10 has a head section 12 and an axially extending shank section 14 . A thread convolution 20 is disposed in a coaxial relationship with the head and shank sections. An improved holding action against rotation al and axial movement of the fastener relative to a metal base member is promoted by a plurality of radially extending wedge shaped compression ramps 24 34 , which are dis posed on the head section 12 and slope radially and axially inwardly toward the shank section 14 . The compression ramps 24 34 are effective to force metal of the base member into an annular groove 42 to hold the fastener against being pushed or pulled axially outwardly from the base member. The compression ramps 24 34 also force the metal of the base member radially inwardly against corners formed on the shank section 14 of the fastener to hold the fastener against rotation.
