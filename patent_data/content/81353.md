# Engine analyser with digital waveform display.

## Abstract
An engine analyzer 10 for an internal combustion engine includes an analog to digital A D converter 132 which digitizes an analog electrical input waveform representing, for example, a secondary or primary voltage waveform of the ignition coil 80 of the internal combustion engine. The digitized input waveform is stored in the form of digital data in a data memory 56 . Upon request by the operator of the apparatus, a microprocessor 48 selects digital data stored, and supplies that digital data to a display 14 , which displays a visual representation of the waveform based upon the selected digital data.
