# Biological specimen processing apparatus.

## Abstract
Container apparatus for processing biological specimens therein is described wherein a perforated receptacle member 10 with abutment means 27,28,30 is attached through a frangible hinge portion 12 to a perforated cover member 11 with detent means 36,37,38,39 . When the cover member 11 is rotated about the hinge 12 to mate against the recep tacle member 10 , the detent means 36,37,38,39 become interengageable with the abutment means 27,28,30 to hold the cover 11 and receptacle 10 members in removable mating relationship.
