# Surfactant enhanced injectivity of xanthan mobility control solutions for tertiary oil recovery.

## Abstract
An aqueous mobility control solution for tertiary oil recovery from saline oil fields comprises from about 200 to 2000 ppm xanthan biopolymer in the form of clean, unreconstituted fermen tation broth and from about 20 to 200 ppm of a selected water soluble polyglycol based surfactant. A process for tertiary oil recovery which comprises the injection of the mobility control solution into saline oil bearing subterranian formations is also disclosed.
