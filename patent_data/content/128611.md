# Infinitely variable transmission.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an infinitely variable transmis sion provided with an endless transmission member 4 and at least one V shaped pulley 2, 3 of which at least one sheave 3 is rigidly connected to a hydraulic cylinder pis ton 5, 7 unit for the axial displacement of this sheave 3 . The said cylinder piston unit 5, 7 being provided with a pressure equalizing chamber 13 for the compensation of pressure rises in the cylinder space 6 due to centrifugal forces. The pressure equalizing chamber 13 can be sup plied with fluid from the cylinder space through a charging port 14 . In order to overcome the drawback of particles ob structing regularly the charging port 14 , ahead of the charging port 14 a filtering member is provided through which the fluid flow must pass.
