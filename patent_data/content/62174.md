# Apparatus treating specimens at raised temperatures.

## Abstract
The apparatus comprises a reaction tube 12 in which the specimen to be treated is carried on a receptable 14. The reaction tube 12 is contained within a pressure vessel 10. Pressure gas is introduced into the reaction tube 12 from source 26 via an inlet tube 24. Gas flows from the reaction tube 12 into the pressure vessel 10 through a tortuous passage between two cap elements forming the closure 22 at the right end of the tube 12. The gas exits from the vessel 10 at the left end through conduit 34. The heating element 18 heats the specimen and the second heating element 20 limits heat loss from the element 18. Receptical 14 is moved by magnets 30, 32 co acting with slug 28 on rod 16.
