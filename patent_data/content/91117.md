In accordance with the present invention, useful blends of a polyetherimide and a polysulfone are generally obtainable in all proportions of the two polymers relative to each other. Consequently, blends comprising from about 1 to about 99 , by weight, polyetherimide and from about 99 to about 1 , by weight polysulfone are included within the scope of the invention. By controlling the proportions of the polyetherimide and polysulfone relative to each other, blends having certain predetermined properties which are improved over those of either the polyetherimide and or the polysulfone component alone may be readily obtained. In general, blends of polyetherimides and polysulfones have good flexural and tensile properties and have an improved impact strength over thespolyetherimide component of the blends. It is contemplated that the polyetherimidepolysulfone blends of the present invention may also include additive materials such as fillers, stabilizers, plasticizers, flexibilizers, surfactant agents, pigments, dyes, reinforcements, flame retardants and diluents in conventional amounts. It is also contemplated that the blends of the invention may include two or more polyetherimides with one or more polysulfones or two or more polysulfones in combination with one or more polyetherimides. Methods for forming polyetherimide polysulfone blends may. vary considerably. Prior art blending techniques are generally satisfactory. A preferred method comprises blending the polymers and additives such as reinforcements in powder, granular or filamentous form, extruding the blend, and chopping the extrudate into pellets suitable for molding by means conventionally used to mold normally solid thermoplastic compositions. The poyetherimide polysulfone blends of the present invention have application in a wide variety of physical shapes and forms, including the use as films, molding compounds, coatings, etc. When used as films or whgn made into molded products, these blends, including laminated products prepared therefrom, not only possess good physical properties at room temperature but they retain their strength and excellent response to workloading at elevated temperatures for long periods of time. Films formed from the blends of this invention may be used in application where films have been used previously.Thus, the blends of the recent invention can be used in automobile and aviation applications for decorative and protective purposes, and as high temperature electrical insulation for motor slot liners, transformers, dielectric capacitors, coil and cable wrappings form wound coil insulation for motors , and for containers and container linings. The blends can also be used in laminated structures where films or solutions of the blend are applied to various heat resistant or other type of materials such as asbestos, mica, glass fiber and the like, the sheets superimposed one upon the other, and thereafter subjecting the sheets to elevated temperatures and pressures to effect flow and cure of the resionous binder to yield cohesive laminated structures. Films made from the subject polyetherimide polysulfone blends can also serve in printed circuit applications. Alternatively, solutions of the blends herein described can be coated on electrical conductors such as copper, aluminum, etc. and thereafter the coated conductor can be heated at elevated tempratures to remove the solvent and provide a continuous resinous composition thereon. If desired, an additional overcoat may be applied to such insulated conductors including the use of polymeric cbatings such as polyamides, polyesters, silicones, polyvinylformal resins, epoxy resins, polyimides, polytetrafluoroethylene, etc. The use of the blends of the present invention as overcoats on other types of insulation is not precluded. Other applications which are contemplated for these blends include their use as binders for asbestos fibers, carbon fibers, and other fibrous materials in making brake linings. In addition, molding compositions and molded articles may be formed from the polymeric blends of the invention preferably by incorporating such fillers as asbestos, glass fibers, talc, quartz, powder, finely divided carbon, silica and the like into the blends prior to molding. Shaped articles may be formed under heat, or under heat and pressure, in accordance with practices well known in the art. The following examples illustrate specific polyetherimide polysulfone blends in accordance with the present invention. It should be understood that the examples are given for the purpose of illustration and do not limit the invention. In the examples, all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLE I Cast and compressed films of several polyetherimidepolysulfone blends according to the invention were prepared and examined for compatability. The polyetherimide of the blend was prepared from the reaction product of essentially equimolar amounts of 2,2 bisl4 3,4 dicarboxyphenoxy phenyl propane dianhydride and m phenylene diamine and had the structural formula EMI11.1 The polysulfones used in preparing the blends were a a polyethersulfone hereinafter PES of the structural formula EMI12.1 and b a polysulfone hereinafter PS sold commercially byUnion Carbide Corporation having the structural formula EMI12.2 Blends of the polyetherimide and the polysulfones were assessed for compatibility by a combining solutions of each polymer to detect cloudiness which can be indicative of incompatibility, b compression molding a dried coprecipitated polymer mixture so as to determine homogeneity in the pressed sample, c solution casting a polymer mixture onto a plate and drying to produce a film so as to determine homogeneity, and d subjecting the blend to differential scanning calorimetry DSC . Specifically, solutions of each polymer of the blend were prepared by dissolving about 10 by weight of the polymer in 90 by weight of dimethyl formamide DMF or chloroform CHC13 . The solutions were then combined and any cloudiness noted. The contained polymer blend was then precipitated by the addition of methanol or by spreading the polymers in DMF on glass plates and then drying in an oven at about 100it to allow the solvent to evaporate at a controlled rate. The precipitated polymer blend in the form of a film was then dried overnight under vacuum. The dried blend was compression molded between aluminum plates for about one minute at about 5000 psig and at about 275 300 C. The above procedure was utilized to prepare blends containing either about 50 or about 25 polyetherimide with each of the above mentionedpolysulfones. A tabulation of the assessments of the blends is set forth inTable I.

From the above results, it can be noted that the clarity of the blends, particularly the blend containingPS, is better when there is a predominance of one component. Further, the 50 50 blend containing PES is considerably clearer than the 50 50 blend containing PS which seems to indicate that the smaller aliphatic content of PES may contribute greater compatibility with the polyetherimide in the blend. EXAMPLE II A polyetherimide polysulfone blend according to the invention was prepared, the blend molded into test specimens and the specimens tested for various physical properties. The polyetherimide for the blend was prepared from the reaction product of essentially equimolar amounts of 2,2 bis 4 3,4 dicarboxyphenoxy phenyl propane dianhydride and m phenylene diamine produced at elevated temperature of about 250 to about 3000 C. and under nitrogen atmosphere. The polymer was extruded at about 3000 C. to form a strand and then mechanically chopped into pellets. A specimen molded from the pellets was tested for various properties and the results are set out at the top of Table II. About 99 parts of the above polyetherimide were mixed with about one part of a polysulfone sold commercially under the trade name UDEL P1700 by UnionCarbide Corporation. This polysulfone by itself had the physical properties as set forth at the bottom of Table II. The blend of the two polymers were then extruded in a 28 mm Werner Pfleiderer extruder having a temperature profile varying from about 610 to 650of and a die temperature of about 6l00F. The resulting extrudate was co,mminuted into pellets and the pellets injection molded into test specimens in a Newbury molding machine at a temperature of about 610 F. The impact strength of these specimens was measured according to the unnotched and notched Izod test, and the results are set forth in Table II.The heat distortion temperature, flexural properties, tensile properties and Gardner impact strength were also measured and are given in Table II. The above procedure in forming a polyetherimidepolysulfone blend of the invention was then repeated to produce test specimens of a series of blends containing varying amounts of polyetherimide relative to the amount of the polysulfone. The only exceptions to the procedure being that the blend containing about 50 polyetherimide was extruded with an extruder temperature profile of about 590 to 625 F. and with a die temperature of about 590 F., the blend containing 30 polyetherimide was extruded with an extruder temperature profile of about 610 to 6400 F. and with a die temperature of 630F., and the blend containing 108 polyetherimide was extruded with an extruder temperature profile of about 610 to 630 F. and a die temperature of about 6200 F. The results of the unnotched and notchedIzod impact test, as well as the heat distortion temperature, flexural and tensile properties and Gardner impact strength for these blends are also detailed in Table II.The blends were transparent at low concentrations of polysulfone, e.g., about 10 or less, were translucent at high concentations of polysulfone, e.g., about 90 or more, and were opaque at concentrations in between about 10 and 90 polysulfone.

As is evident from the above experimental results, blends of the polyetherimide and the polysulfone have an improved impact strength over the polyetherimide component alone as evidenced by the unnotched Izod and Gardner impact values, particularly when the blend contains over 50 polysulfone, while exhibiting good tensile, flexural and heat distortion properties. More specifically, the blends exhibited an unnotchedIzod impact strength which improves dramatically with increasing concentration of polysulfone as evidenced by the test specimens containing in excess of 10 polysulfone being deformed, rather than broken, by impact of the hammer in the Izod test. Similarly, the Gardner impact strength of the blends was in excess of 320 in lbs when the concentration of polysulfone was about 50 or greater. In addition, the notched Izod values for the blends, within experimental error, do not vary appreciably within the range of concentrations tested. The heat distortion temperature data of the blends, when plotted, increases on a smooth nonlinear curve with increasing polyetherimide concentration as do the tensile, yield and failure strengths. Example III A polyetherimide polyphenyl sulfone blend according to the invention was prepared, the blend molded into test specimens and the test specimens tested for various physical properties. About 99 parts of a polyetherimide made in accordance with the procedure of Example II and having the physical properties set forth in Table III were mixed with about one part of a polyphenylsulfone sold commercially under the trade name Radel R 5000 by Union Carbide Corporation. This polyphenylsulfone by itself had the physical properties set forth at the bottom of Table III. The mixture of the two polymer was then extruded in a Werner Pfleiderer extruder having a temperature profile varying from about 600 to 650 F and a die temperature of about 630F. The resulting extrudate was comminuted into pellets and the pellets injection molded at about 650jap. to 675 F. into test specimens.Impact strengths of these specimens were measured according to the unnotched and notched Izod test and the results are set forth in Table III. The heat distortion temperature, glass transition temperature, flexural properties, and tensile properties of the test specimens of the blend were also measured and are given in Table III. The above procedure in forming a polyetherimidepolyphenylsulfone blend according the invention was then repeated to produce test specimens of a series of blends containing varying amounts of poiyetherimide relative to the amount of polyphenylsulfone. The results of the unnotched and notched Izod impact test, as well as the heat distortion temperature glass transition temperature flexural properties, and tensile properties for test specimens of the blends are also detailed in Table III.

No break As is apparent from the above test results, the blends of the invention have improved tensile and flexural properties over that of the polyphenylsulfone component alone and have improved unnotched Izod impact values over that of the polyetherimide component alone. In addition, blends of the polyetherimide and this polysulfone appear to be completely compatible over the entire blending composition range as evidenced by a single glass transition temperature for each blend and by the blends being transparent. More specifically, the notched Izod values for the blends remain fairly constant from 99 to 30 polyetherimide and below the 30 level, the notched Izod increases rather sharply and approaches the value for the polyphenylsulfone alone. In contrast, the unnotched Izod value increases from the 99 polyetherimide blend to a maximum extrapolated value of about 70 ft lb in for the blend containing about 258 polyetherimide. The tensile yield elongation is in the range of about 16 to 18 regardless of the blend ratio while the tensile strength at yield increases linearly from pure polysulfone to a 90 polyetherimide blend. The failure strength increases from the 90 polysulfone blend to the pure polyetherimide. Due to some small specks contained in the blends, the failure elongation is less than normally expected as the specimens break during the neckdown period due to the presence of the specks. As to the flexural properties, both the initial modulus and ultimate strength exhibit straight line relationships when plotted versus the composition for the blend. Example IV A polyetherimide polyethersulfone blend according to the invention was prepared, the blend molded into test specimens and the specimens tested for various physical properties. About90 parts of the above polyetherimide made in accordance with the procedure of Example II and having the physical properties set forth in Table IV were mixed with 10 parts of a polyethersulfone sold commercially under the trade name VICTREX 200P by Imperial Chemical Industries,Ltd. This polyethersulfone by itself has the physical properties set forth at the bottom of Table IV. The mixture of the two polymers was then extruded in a 28 mmWerner Pfleiderer extruder having a temperature profile varying from about 610 to 650 F. and a die temperature of about 610 F. The resulting extrudate was comminuted into pellets and the pellets injection molded at about 650 F. into test specimens. Impact strengths of these specimens was measured according to the standard unnotched and notched Izod test and the results are set forth in TableIV. The heat distortion temperature, Gardner impact strength, flexural properites and tensile properties of the blend were also measured and are given in Table IV. The above procedure in forming a polyetherimidepolyethersulfone blend according to the invention was then repeated to produce test specimens of a series of blends containing varying amounts of polyetherimide relative to the amount of polyethersulfone. The test specimens of the blend containing about 70 polyetherimide were produced under the same conditions as above while the test specimens of the blends containing about 50, 30 and 10 polyetherimide were extruded at about 640 to 670 F with a die temperature of about 675 F and molded at about 600 The results of the unnotched and notched Izod impact test, as well as the heat distortion temperature, Gardner impact strength, flexural properties, and tensile properties for test specimens of the blends are also detailed in Table IV.

Not mcasured in absolute values and are higher than normal by factor of about 2. All of the blends produced were transparent with the exception of the blends containing 30 and 50 polyetherimide which were translucent. As is apparent from the above test results, the polyetherimide and the polyethersulfone components are generally compatible and produce blends of satisfactory physical characteristics over the entire blending composition range.More specifically, the notched Izod impact strength for the blends is at a maximum at a 50 50 blend ratio while the unnotched Izod samples exhibit no breaks below a 70 polyetherimide concentration. The polyetherimide polyethersulfone blends have slightly lower tensile strengths and flexural modulus as compared with the polyetherimide component alone. The Gardner impact strength of the blends is directly proportional to polyethersulfone concentration with a Gardner impact strength in excess of 320 in lb being attained with a blend containing about 90 polyethersulfone. The tensile strengths exhibit a small but steady decrease in both the yield and failure values as the polyethersulfone concentration of the blend increases.The failure elongation for the blends has a maximum value at 50 50 concentration ratio and the initial flexural modulus decreases with increasing polyethersulfone content in the blend while the strength at 5 strain remains fairly constant regardless of the proportion of the blend components. Substitution of other polyetherimides and or other polysulfones for the polyetherimides and or polysulfones blends of the above examples results in the formulation of polyetherimide polysulfone polymer blends having similar characteristics such as improved impact strengths as compared with the polyetherimide component alone and such blends are considered within the scope of the present invention. While the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments thereof, it will be understood that numerous modifications may be made by those skilled in the art without actually departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
