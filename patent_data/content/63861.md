## Description
TITLE STORAGE SYSTEMSDESCRIPTIONTechnical FieldThe invention relates to storage systems1 and equipment for assembly into a storage system. Background ArtPatent Specification GB 997753 Reilly describes a pallet rack comprising uprights A,B supporting horizontal rails 13 etc. The posts are of partially closed channel cross section with an inwardly disposed medial channel 25 having a number of slots 28. A connecting element 29 is welded to the end of the rail 13 and provided with teeth 37,38,39 for entering the slots 28. The connecting element 29 embraces the whole of one face and almost half of ar,other face of the post A. Thus the rails 13,14 can only project laterally to either side of the post A, and the space between post A and the post B to the rear is filled with cross members 10,11,12 of different construction, as is essential with heavy duty pallet racking.Patent Specification GB 1239136 Finspa is similar.Patent Specifications GB 1333520 SOFADI , GB 1373714 BAG and GB 1576263 Searby describe lighter weight systems for use as furniture.The uprights are generally of square cross section with longitudinal rows of slots but without any medial channel. The transverse members have hooks which engage in the slots, but the connecting members do not embrace the uprights, and so the structures do not have the necessary strength for general use.The InventionEquipment according to the invention comprises a tubular upright having four similar faces, a groove along each face, a row of slots along the groove, and an end connector for a transverse member having upright flanges for embracing less than half of each of two adjacent faces and at least two hooks for engaging in the slots. The four similar faces with longitudinal grooves form a closed box section of great torsional strength. The end connector embracing less than half of each face makes it possible for two connectors to project at the same level from a single face, or for connectors to project from as many as four faces of the upright at the same level. Horizontal stability is provided by the parts of the flanges which embraces the upright together with the hooks these parts ensuring that there is a resistance to movement about a vertical axis.Transverse members may be integral with or welded or otherwise connected to the end connectors, and include tie beams, shelf support beams, and open channel beams. The tie beams enable a number of tubular uprights to be linked together into a rigid structure.The shelf support beams enable shelves to be supported on the structure and to provide an uninterrupted surface. The open channel beams may be used in pairs, one above the other, with their open channels facing one another, to mount louvre panels used in turn for mounting storage bins.A number of half depth beams having only an end connector with a single hook at each end may be included. Spring clips can be fitted to the connecting members and slots to resist dislodgement. Versatile storage systems may be assembled from the parts described. The preferred uprights together with the preferred end connectors are capable of mounting transverse members extending directly out from any or all of the four faces of the uprights. Shelves can be mounted at various levels and bins for small components can be supported on louvre panels.A standard bay width of perhaps one metre may be adopted, and a complex system of numerous different kinds of accessories can be built up with units of standard width or a multiple thereof, Such accessories include pallet racking, cantilever, shelving, cupboards, and drawers in addition to the others mentioned elsewhere. The system itself may be mounted on a.free standing trolley for conveying parts about a factory, for example. The parts described are preferably rolled from mild steel, suitably from 0.9 mm to 3mm thick depending on size and intended use, most suitably 2mm thick. The hooks of the end connectors may be punched from the flanges before roll9ng, Brief Description of Drawings Figure 1 is an isometric view of parts of equipment according to the invention Figure 2 is a section through a part of a storage system incorporating equipment as in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a section on B B inFigure 2 Figure 4 shows a number of plan views of alternative storage systems according to the invention and Figure 5 shows a number of isometric views of other such systems.Best Mode With particular reference to Figure 1, a tubular upright 10 has four similar faces, only two of witch appear clearly. A groove 12 along each. face has a row of slots 14 therein.Two alternative end connectors 20, 20 t are shown off set from the upright 10 The end connector 20 has an integral upright flange 22 for embracing the upright 10, while the connector 20t has a welded on flange 22 for heavy duty. Both the flanges 22,22 have two hooks 24 for engaging in the slots 14 of the upright 10. The connectors 20,20 also comprise transverse beams 26 extending to the right.Turning now to Figure 2, the upright 10 has four end connectors 20 extending one to left and one to right and two up the paper. Each end connector 20 embraces a different corner of the periphery of the upright 10, and has its hooks 24 in slots 14 thereof. The connector flanges can be seen to embrace less than half a face of the upright 10, and the adjacent ends of the connectors 20 to embrace less than half of an adjacent face of the upright 10. This leaves a horizontal gap between connectors at the same level which has various constructional uses. Between the end connectors 20 extending up the paper and the beams integral therewith there is a sheet of cladding 30. To the right of the upright 10 is a shelf 32 which is hooked over one of the end connectors 20 extending up the paper1 and rests on a lug 34 projecting from the end connector 20 extending to the right as shown in Figure 3. At the front edge in Figure 2, the shelf 32 is bent over as shown in section C C, and stops short of the right front end connector 20 leaving a gap 36 which might be used for the insertion of steel or welded mesh cladding. t he general plan views of Figure 4 show how uprights 10 can be arranged in relation to each other so as to fill the space available for storage or display in an economical and visually pleasing manner.The isometrics of Figure 5 illustrate the development of walk ways between one or more tiers, the use of mezzanine platforms with stairs, and a door way and counter.
