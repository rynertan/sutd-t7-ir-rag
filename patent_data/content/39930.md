# Process for the production of blow molded articles.

## Abstract
In a blow molding process in which a parison is blown to form an article which is then cooled and recovered, a liquefied gas is introduced into the interior of partially blown article where it becomes vaporized and causes the completion of the blowing step as well as to cool the article. A mixture of the blowing gas and vaporized liquefied gas is recovered and recycled for use as the blowing gas in a subsequent blow molding step.
