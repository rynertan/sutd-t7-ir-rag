# Method and machine for retreading pneumatic tyres.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method for applying a tread to a tyre, whereby around a toroidal tyre a layer of non vulcanized rubber is applied, which will form the tread area of the tyre after vulcanzation in the vulcanization press and whereby the thus prepared tyre is vulcanized in vulcanization press. According to the invention, before the vulcanization of the thus prepared tyre 4 in a vulcanization press, portions of the layer of non vulcanized rubber are removed by peeling or by forming peels 22 of nonvulcanized rubber, so that the shape of the peeled tyre 4 is adapted to the shape of the vulcanization press. The invention also relates to a machine for carrying out the method according to the invention.
