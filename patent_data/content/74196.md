# Gas turbine prechamber and fuel manifold structure.

## Abstract
An improved prechamber 52 and fuel manifold structure for a gas turbine engine having a premixing prevaporizing type combustor 10, the improvement residing in the provi sion of a prechamber 52 having an internal cylindrical surface 36 swept by swirling pressurized air passing through the prechamber from a plenum 12 into the combustor 10 and in the provision of a fuel manifold having a plurality of individual fuel conduits 62, 66, 67 extending from a remote fuel supply pipe 53 to a corresponding plurality of delivery heads 64, 72 in the prechamber. The delivery heads 64, 72 direct fuel generally tangentially to the internal cylindrical surface 36 to form a film for vaporization in the passing air and the length of the fuel conduits and the flow area of the fuel conduits and the delivery heads are generally equal so that fuel flow in the fuel conduits is balanced and so that when the conduits are opened to atmospheric pressure at termination of combustion, purging of residual fuel to prevent coking is rapid and complete.
