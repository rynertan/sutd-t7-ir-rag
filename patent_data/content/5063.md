## Abstract
An amino methylenesulfonic acid comprising the reaction product of an amine substituted succinimide containing free primary or secondary nitrogen atoms a compound of the formula R₂ R₃ wherein R₂ is a hydrogen or a methyl group and R₃ is a hydrogen or an alkyl group having from about 1 to 7 carbon atoms and sulfur dioxide which can be alternatively reacted with a polyfunctional cross linking agent and mixtures of the aminomethylene sulfonic acid with a nitrogen compound adduct of a maleic anhydride olefin copolymer. These compounds have anti static activity and can be used in fuels.
