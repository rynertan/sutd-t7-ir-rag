# Process for removal of sulfur and ash from coal.

## Abstract
A process for reducing the sulfur and ash content of coal wherein coal particles are treated in an aqueous slurry with a minor amount of hydrocarbon oil to form coal oil aggregates which are then separated from ash and mineral matter in the slurry by dissolved gas flotation. Optionally, the coal particles may be treated, prior to the aggregation step, with a conditioning agent which modifies or alters the existing surface characteristics of the ash and pyritic sulfur mineral matter. Recovered coal particles comprise a substantial part of the feed carbon values.
