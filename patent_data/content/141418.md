# Drawn product of crystalline polymer having high tenacity and high modulus and process for the production thereof.

## Abstract
A process for producing a drawn product of a crystalline polymer having high tenacity and high modulus, which comprises compressing a gel like material prepared from a solution of a crystalline polymer in a solvent i.e. a gel like sheet material A consisting of gel like particles of a crystalline polymer and a solvent which is prepared by cooling a solution of a crystalline polymer in a solvent, or a gel like film material B which is prepared by casting a solution of a crystalline polymer in a solvent at a tempera ture lower than the temperature at which the gel like material is dissolved, whereby removing a part of the solvent contained in the gel like material, and drawing the compress ed material, preferably using a drawing die. The drawn product is particularly useful as a tension member for optical fiber cable.
