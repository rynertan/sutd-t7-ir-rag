# Dispersible sulfur product and its process of manufacture.

## Abstract
A dispersed sulfur product having good flowability can be formed by dispersing particulate sulfur in a liquid poly cis isoprene dispersion agent i.e., either made by poly merizing synthetic cis isoprene or by depolymerizing nat ural rubber . The sulfur product resulting therefrom has good dispersibility in rubber. The product can be formed without using an aqueous co precipitation technique by sim ply mixing the liquid poly cis isoprene dispersion agent with a major amount of sulfur until the desired product results.
