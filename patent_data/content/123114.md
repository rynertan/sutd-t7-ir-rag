# Urea linked immunogens, antibodies, and preparative method.

## Abstract
Immunogen conjugates comprising amino functional ized haptens coupled through a carbonyl bridge to amino groups in immunogenic proteins and polypeptides. The resulting simple urea linkage in the conjugate is hydrophilic and contributes essentially no haptenic determinants. The immunogen is characterized by a high epitopic density. The method involves reaction of the hapten with a carbonyl diimidazole followed by addition of the protein or polypeptide carrier. Protein crosslinking problems common to prior art coupling methods are avoided.
