# Improvements relating to electroviscous fluid actuated devices.

## Abstract
An electroviscous fluid actuated device, such as a clutch, comprises relatively rotatable electrode plates 10, 11 defin ing a gap 12 therebetween of 2 mm to 5 mm width. An elec troviscous fluid in the gap 12 becomes solid when a pulsat ing d.c. is applied to the plates. Slippage can be controlled by controlling the peak value of the pulsating d.c. The electroviscous fluid comprises a suspension of starch in silicone oil, having a ratio by weight of at least 1 1.
