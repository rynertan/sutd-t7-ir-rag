# Complementary MOS integrated circuit having means for preventing latch up phenomenon.

## Abstract
The complementary MOS integrated circuit has a first channel MOS FET in a substrate of one conductivity type and a second channel MOS FET in a well region of the other conductivity type, and further comprises a first high impuritv region of the one conductivity type formed in the substrate so as to surround the first channel MOS FET, a second high impurity region of the other conductivity type formed in the well region so as to surround the second channel MOS FET, a first insulator film covering the first and second high impurity regions and having a plurality of first holes, a first wiring layer formed on the first insulator film with connec tions with the first high impurity region through the first holes, so as to surround the first channel MOS FET, a second wiring layer formed on the first insulator film with connec tions with the second high impurity region through the second holes, so as to surround the second channel MOS FET, a second insulator film covering the first and second wiring layers and having a plurality of second holes, a third wiring layer formed on the second insulator film, connected with the first wiring layer through the second holes and supplied with a first power potential, and a fourth wiring layer formed on the second insulator film, connected with the second wiring layer through the second holes and supplied with a second power potential.
