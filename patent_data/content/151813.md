# A process for phosphatizing and use thereof.

## Abstract
Aqueous compositions containing as essential ingre dients an alkanolamine, an aliphatic carboxylic acid contain ing 5 to 18 carbon atoms, and an arylenetriazole have been found effective in removing resin containing sealants from the surfaces of zinc containing metals, such as galvanized steel, without causing changes in the surfaces of the metal, so that phosphate coatings which are subsequently applied to said surfaces are neither streaky nor spotty.
