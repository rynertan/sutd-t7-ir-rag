# Control circuit for controlling light source in optical disc device.

## Abstract
An optical disc device including a semiconductor laser 1 as a light source and making the light output of the semicon ductor laser different between an information recording opera tion and an information reproducing operation is disclosed in which the semiconductor laser 1 is connected in parallel with protection circuit 5 , and in which the protection circuit 5 is put in a short circuited state between two terminals thereof when a monitor signal 70 corresponding to the light output of the semiconductor laser 1 exceeds a predetermined value 67, 69 164, 162 .
