# Low molecular weight aromatic polymers with biphenylene end groups.

## Abstract
Biphenylene end capped low molecular weight thermally stable aromatic polymers and the process for their prepara tion. The invention is further directed to crosslinked bipheny lene end capped aromatic polymers and to the process for their preparation. The process for preparing the biphenylene end capped low molecular weight thermally stable aromatic polymers comprises carrying out a misbalanced polymerisa tion reaction of a suitable aromatic aminoketone compound and a suitable aromatic ketomethylene compound and there after adding a monofunctional biphenylene compound.
