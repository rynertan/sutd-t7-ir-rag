# METHOD OF CONTINUOUSLY COLORING STAINLESS STEEL.

## Abstract
A method of continuously coloring a stainless steel strip. When the surface of a stainless steel strip is being colored as desired as it is continuously passed through a coloring solution, the potential difference is detected be tween a reference electrode on the steel strip and each of two fixed positions which the steel strip passes, either side of the portion of the steel strip which is in contact with the coloring solution, and the processing conditions are con trolled so that variations in the difference between the two potential differences are suppressed.
