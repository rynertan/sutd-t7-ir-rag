# Ion exchange resins containing post deposited metal oxides.

## Abstract
The density and capacity of macroporous ion exchange resins are increased by incorporating therein at least one of titania hydrate, zirconia hydrate, hydrated titanium phos phorus, and hydrated zirconium phosphate hydrates. Such resin composites are useful, e. g., in removing uranium from aqueous solutions.
