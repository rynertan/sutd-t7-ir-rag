## Description
Method of Preparing Erythromycin A Cyclic 11,12 Carbonate The subject matter of the invention 18 a method of preparing erythromycin A cyclic 11,21carbonate used as an antibacterial with more ad vantageous properties than the parent. antibiotic, simultaneously not being its prodrug. The preparation of erythromycin A cyclic 11,12 carbonate consists in transesterification of ethylene carbonate using erythromycin A or its salts. A process for preparing erythromycin cyclic carbonate in the reaction of erythromycin with a considerable excess of ethyl ene carbonate in an inert solvent in the presence of alkaline catalysts, particularly of K2C03 is known from the U.S.A. patent specification No.3 417 077. However in the described process the total reaction of the substrate 18 not only not complete, but considerable quantities of 10,11anhydroerythromycin A are formed, The degree of the reacted substrate in the desired direction may be increased. According to the Polish patent specification No. 70 623 it can be done due to the use of anhydrous substrates and reduction of temperature with a simultaneous diminution of ethylene carbonate excess. According to the Polish patent speci fiction No. 93 849 erythromycin thiocyanate or lactate may be used as outputproducts. In both cases the reaction is carried out in an aprotic solvent, advantageously in toluene,The high degree of the reacted substrate is obtained, according to the Polish patent specificationNo. 86 961, by the use of ethylene carbonate as solvent, constituting simultaneously the substrate in the process of transesterification. The discussed process, independently of the way it is run, is taking place in a two phase sys tem, namely the liquid and the solid phase. In the mentioned Polish patent specifications the solid phase is constituted by K2CO3 as catalyst. Although the quantities of the K2CO3 catalyst are less large than in the case of the U.S.A. patent specification, it is used on the average as 1 part by weight per 2 parts of erythromycin. The disadvantage of the discussed methods consists of long duration of the reaction, favoring the formation of by products as e.g. of 10,11anhydroerythromycin A, particularly at increased temperature. One of the causes or this phenomenon consists in the use of big quantities of highly alkaline inorganic catalysts in an anhydrous medium of organic solvents, in which they dissolve badly. It has been found that the use in the reaction as catalysts of substances of the PTC Phase Transfer Catalyst type, such as quarternary ammonium compounds, phosphonium compounds, crewn ethers or cryptands, enables to reduce considerably the quantity of the used alkaline catalyst, to snorten the duration of the transesterification reaction or the cyclic 1,2 or 1,3 diole carbonate by means or erythromycin or of its salts In the case of introductton of definite quarternary ammonium or phosphonium compounds it even permits to eliminate from the process the alkaline catalyst. The trans esterification process proceeds in dehydrated organic solvents. An additional advantage consists in the min imization of the appearance in the reaction products of 10,11 anhydroerythromycin A, which constitutes a decomposition product of erythromycin A cyclic 11,12 carbonate. Besides of that a diminution of the quantity Or cyclic 1,2 diole carbonate and even the application of cyclic 1,3 diole carbonate , constituting the basic reactant in the transesteri fication process, Is advantageous in comparison with the known methods. By the method according to the invention the transesterification reaction either of dehydrated cyclic 1,2 diole carbonates, advantageously of ethylene or propylene carbonate, or of dehydrated cyclic 1,3 diole carbonates, advantageously of trimethylene carbonate using dehydrated erytromycin or its salts, is conducted either in an anhydrous organic solvent or in an anhydrous diole carbonates constituting simultaneously one of the reaction substrates, in the presence of the PTC type catalyst, such as a quartenary ammonium or phosphonium compound with addition of an inorganic compound As organic solvants are advantageously used toluene or acetone. As quartarnE3ry ammonium compounds are used triethylbenzylammonium chloride TEBA , tetrabutylammonium bromide, trioctylmethylammonium chloride and as phosphonium compound tetrabutylphosphonium chloride. It has been found as advantageous to use triethylbenzylammonium chloride in an organic solvent, such as benzene or its homologuess, whereas trioctylmethylammonium chloride in such an organic solvent as e,g, acetone or acetonltrtle. Inorganic compounds used according to the invention consist either of salts of alkali metals or of alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, potas slum, lithium, calcium, barium carbonates or acid carbonates, advantageously potassium carbonate, or of hydroxides or oxides of the above mentioned metals or mixtures of these compounds. AB PTC catalysts may be also applled according to the invention crown ethers or cryptands. The use of crown ethers in the erythromycinA cyclic 11,12 carbonate productlon improves the solubility of inorganic cations, increasing thus the effectiveness of the catalysis by basic inorganic salts. The use of crown ethers contalning 12 carbon atoms and 6 oxygen atoms in the basic moiety, especially of 1,4,7,13,16 hexaoxacyclo octadecane is particularly advantageous, Equal results are obtained with cryptands, advantageously 4,7,13,16,21,24 hexaoxa 1,10 diazabicyclo 8,8,8 hexacosane, Should as PTC catalyst a quartenary ammonium or phosphonium compound be used, an equilibrium in the liquid phase would ta.ke place between the initial ammonium or phosphonium salt and the quarternary compound newly formed in the reaction medium containing the anion derived from the alkali metal or rrom the alkaline earth metal compound. According to the invention it is particul arly important to run the transesterification reaction in the presence of produced outside of the reaction medium either quarternary ammonium hydr oxides alone or their salts with weak acids, advantageously carbonates, or analogous phosphonium compounds, although this process is in a certain degree limited. In such transesterification process both the quarternary ammonium compound and the phosphonium compound constitute independent catalysts. The use of FTC catalysts brings about a con siderable increase of concentration of the cata lyat in the organic solvent, what may also provoke the formation of undesirable degradation products. It is therefore necessary to choose .properly the concentration, the kinds of catalysts and the organic solvent, as well as the parameters of the process in order to secure its most effective course from the point of view of the industrial production. Pursulng the method according to the present invention, erythromycin or the intermediate Droduct obtained during its isolation, as for example erythromycin thiocysnate or lactate may be used in the discussed transesterification process.
