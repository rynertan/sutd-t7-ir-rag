# Composition for use in oil recovery, its method of use and novel surfactant compounds.

## Abstract
Betaines containing the pyridine nucleus, some of which are novel per se, are dissolved in sea water or formation water, the concentration of betaine being from 200 to 100,000 ppm, to give a surfactant solution suitable for displacing crude oil from a formation in an enhanced oil recovery process. These be taines have low interfacial tension against oil , a high toler ance towards divalent metal ions and good temperature stabili ty as compared with betaines previously proposed for en hanced oil recovery.
