## Description
GRF ANALOGS The present invention relates to peptides having influence on the function of the pituitary gland in humans and other animals. In particular, the present invention is directed to peptides which promote the release of growth hormone by the pituitary gland. Physiologists have long recognized that the hypothalamus controls the secretory functions of the adenohypophysis with the hypothalamus producing special substances which stimulate or inhibit the secretion of each pituitary hormone. In 1982, human pancreatic tumor releasing factors hpGRF were isolated from extracts of human pancreatic tumors, purified, characterized, synthesized and tested, which were found to promote the release of GH by the pituitary. A corresponding rat hypothalamic GH releasing factor rGRF or rhGRF and a corresponding porcine hypothalamic GH releasing factor pGRF have also been characterized and synthesized. Synthetic polypeptides have now been synthesized and tested which release GH from cultured pituitary cells and which may at least partially resist enzymatic degradation in the body. These peptides meet at least one of the following criteria a the residue in the l position has either a Ni Me or a Ce substitution b D Leu is present in the 17 and or 23 positions and or c D Glu or D Asp is present in the 25 position. The peptides may meet more than one or even all of the foregoing criteria. The residue in the l position may be Tyr, D Tyr, Met, Pile, D Phe, pCl Phe, Leu, His and D His which residue may have the methyl substitution either on the alpha carbon or in the alpha amino group .The peptides may optionally have D Ala at the 2 position and or D Asp at the 3 position and orD Arg or D Ser at the 8 position and or D Tyr at the 10 position and or D Ala at the 15 position. The peptides preferably also have a substitution such asD Met, Nie or Nva for Met in the 27 position. Pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the invention include such analogs which are between about 28 and 44 residues in length, or a nontoxic salt of any of these, dispersed in a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable liquid or solid carrier. Such pharmaceutical compositions can be used in clinical medicine, both human and veterinary, for administration for therapeutic purposes, and also diagnostically.Moreover, they can be used to promote the growth of warmblooded animals, including fowl, and in aquiculture for cold blooded animals, e.g. fish, eels, etc. The nomenclature used to define the peptides is that specified by Schroder Lubke, The Peptides ,Academic Press 1965 , wherein in accordance with conventional representation the amino group at theN terminus appears to the left and the carboxyl group at the C terminus to the right. By natural amino acid is meant one of common, naturally occurring amino acids found in proteins comprising Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile,Ser, Thr, Lys, Arg, Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln, Cys, Met, Pile, Tyr, Pro, Trp and His. By Nle is meant norleucine, and by Nva is meant norvaline. Where the amino acid residue has isomeric forms, it is the L form of the amino acid that is represented unless otherwise expressly indicated. The invention provides synthetic peptides having the following sequence Rl R2 R3 Ala Ile Phe Thr R8 Ser RlO Arg Rl2 R13 Leu R15 Gln R17 R18 Ala Arg Lys Leu Leu R24 R25 Ile R27 R28 Arg Gln Gln Gly Glu R34 Asn Gln Glu R38 R39 R40 Arg R42 R43 R44 wherein R1 is Tyr, D Tyr, Met, Pile, D Phe, pCl Phe,Leu, His or D His, which has either a C Me or NO Me substitution or is unsubstituted R2 is Ala or D Alat R3 is Asp or D Asp R8 is Ser, Asn, D Ser or D Asn Rlo is Tyr or D Tyr R12 is Arg or Lys R13 is Ile or Val R15 is Gly or D Ala R17 is Leu or D Leu R18 is Tyr or Ser R24 is His or Gln R25 is Glu,Asp, D Glu or D Asp R27 is Met, D Met, Ala, Nle, Ile,Leu, Nva or Val R28 is Asn or Ser R34 is Arg orSer R38 is Gln or Arg R39 is Arg or Gly R40 isSer or Ala R42 is Phe1 Ala or Val R43 is Asn orArg R44 is a natural amino acid provided however that either a R1 has a C Me or an NiMe substitution or b R17 and or R23 is D Leu or c R25 is either D Glu or D Asp and provided also that any or all of the residues between R29 and R44, inclusive, may be deleted. The carboxyl moiety of the amino acid residue at the C terminus may be the radical COOR, CRO, CONHNHR, CON R R or CH20R, with R andR being lower alkyl, fluoro lower alkyl or hydrogen, with methyl, ethyl and propyl being the preferred lower alkyl groups, with all of the foregoing radicals being considered to be equivalents. Usually the residue at the C terminus is in the form of the free acid or the simple amide.When Met appears in position 1, it may be preferable to have another residue in position 27. As defined above, fragments which extend from the N terminal through about residue 28 have biological potency, and such biologically active fragments are considered as falling within the scope of the overall invention. When the peptide fragment extends only to residue 28, Y should be NH2 or a substituted amide.When the fragment extends to one of residues 29 thru 39,Y is preferably an amide or a substituted amide but may be OH. When the fragment has 40 or more residues, there is no clear preference for the moiety at the C terminus. The peptides are synthesized by a suitable method, such as by exclusively solid phase techniques, by partial solid phase techniques, by fragment condensation or by classical solution couplings. The employment of recently developed recombinant DNA techniques may be used to prepare a portion of an analog containing only natural amino acid residues. For example, the techniques of exclusively solid phase synthesis are set forth in the textbook Solid PhasePeptide Synthesis , Stewart Young, Freeman Co., SanFrancisco, 1969, and are exemplified by the disclosure of U.S. Patent No. 4,105,603, issued August 8, 1978 toVale et al. Classical solution synthesis is described in detail in the treatise Methoden der OrganischenChemie Houben Weyl Synthese von Peptiden , E. Wunsch editor 1974 Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, W. Ger.The fragment condensation method of synthesis is exemplified in U.S. Patent No. 3,972,859 August 3, 1976 . Other available syntheses are exemplified byU.S. Patent No. 3,842,067 October 15, 1974 and U.S.Patent No. 3,862,925 January 28, 1975 . Common to such syntheses is the protection of the labile side chain groups of the various amino acid moieties with suitable protecting groups which will prevent a chemical reaction from occurring at that site until the group is ultimately removed. Usually also common is the protection of an alpha amino group on an amino acid or a fragment while that entity reacts at the carboxyl group, followed by the selective removal of the alpha amino protecting group to allow subsequent reaction to take place at that location. Accordingly, it is common that, as a step in the synthesis, an intermediate compound is produced which includes each of the amino acid residues located in its desired sequence in the peptide chain with side chain protecting groups linked to the appropriate residues. Also considered to be within the scope of the present invention are intermediates of the formula Xl Rl X or X2 R2 R3 X3 Ala Ile Phe Thr X4 R8 X4 or X5 Ser X4 R10 x2 Arg x6 R12 x6 or X R13 Leu 5 2 6 7R15 Gln X5 Rl7 Rl8 X Ala Arg X Lys X Leu R23 R24 X or X5 R25 X3 Ile R27 R28 X4 or X5 Arg X6 Gln X5 Gln X5 Gly Glu X3 R34 X4 or X6 Asn X5 Gln X5 Glu X3 R38 X5 or X6 R39 X6 R40 X4 Arg X6 R42 R43 X5 or X6 R44 X8 X9 wherein X is either hydrogen or an amino protecting group. TheO amino protecting groups contemplated by X1 are those well known to be useful in the art of step wi se synthesis of polypeptides.Among the classes of amino protecting groups which may be employed as X1 are 1 aromatic urethan type protecting groups, such as fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl FMOC , benzyloxycarbonyl Z and substituted Z, such as p chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl, p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, and p methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl 2 aliphatic urethan protecting groups, such as t butyloxycarbonyl BOC , diisopropylmethyloxycarbonyl, isopropyloxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl and 3 cycloalkyl urethan type protecting groups1 such as cyclopentyloxycarbonyl, adamantyloxycarbonyl,and cyclohexyloxycarbonyl. The preferred Oc amino protecting group is BOC, even when an N alpha Me substituted residue is employed in the l position. X is hydrogen or a protecting group for the imidazole nitrogen of His, such as Tos. X2 may be a suitable protecting group for the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr, such as tetrahydropyranyl, tert butyl, trityl, Bzl, CBZ, 4Br CBZ and 2,6 dichlorobenzyl DCB . The preferred protecting 2 group is 2,6 dichlorobenzyl. X can be hydrogen which means that there is no side chain protecting group on the amino acid residue in that position. X3 is hydrogen or a suitable ester forming protecting group for the carboxyl group of Asp or Glu, such as benzyl OBzl , 2,6 dichlorobenzyl, methyl and ethyl. X4 may be a suitable protecting group for the hydroxyl group of Thr or Ser, such as acetyl, benzoyl, tert butyl, trityl, tetrahydropyranyl, Bzl, 2,6 dichlorobenzyl and CBZ. The preferred protecting group is Bzl. 4X can be hydrogen, which means there is no protecting group on the hydroxyl group. X5 is hydrogen or a suitable protecting group for the side chain amido group of Asn or Gln. It is preferably xanthyl Xan . X6is a suitable protecting group for the guanidino group of Arg, such as nitro, Tos, CBZ, adamantyloxycarbonyl, and BOC, or is hydrogen. 7 X is hydrogen or a suitable protecting group for the side chain amino group of Lys. Illustrative of suitable side chain amino protecting groups are 2 chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl 2 Cl Z , Tos, t amyloxycarbonyl and BOC. X8is hydrogen or a suitable side chain protecting group as generally specified above. Met can optionally be protected by oxygen, but is preferably left unprotected. The selection of a side chain amino protecting group is not critical except that generally one is chosen which is not removed during deprotection of the amino groups during the synthesis. However, for some amino acids, e.g. His, protection is not generally necessary after coupling is completed, and the protecting groups may be the same. X9 is a suitable protecting group for theC terminal carboxyl group, such as the ester forming 3 group X , or is an anchoring bond used in solid phase synthesis for linking to a solid resin support, or is 9 des X , in which case the residue at the C terminal has a carboxyl moiety which is Y, as defined hereinbefore. When such a solid resin support is used, it is broadly considered to be a protecting group and may be any of those known in therart, such as O CH2 resin support, NH benzhydrylamine BHA resin support or NH paramethylbenzhydrylamine MBHA resin support.When the unsubstituted amide is desired, use of BHA or MBHA resin is preferred, because cleavage directly gives the amide. In case the N methyl amide is desired, it can be generated from an N methyl BHA resin. Should other substituted amides be desired or should other groups than the free acid be desired at the C terminus, it may be preferable to sythesize the peptide using classical methods as set forth in the Houben Weyl text. In the formula for the intermediate, at least one one of the X groups is a protecting group or X9 includes resin support. Thus, the invention also provides a method for manufacturing a peptide of interest by a forming a peptide intermediate having at least one protective group and the formula II X R X or x24 R2 R3 x3 Ala Ile Phe Thr X4 R8 X4 or X5 Ser X4 Tyr X2 Arg X6 R12 X6 or X7 R13 Leu Gly Gln X R17 R18 X Ala Arg X Lys X Leu Leu e 5 R23 Rg4 X or X R25 X Ile R27 R28 X or X Arg X6 Gln X5 Gln X5 Gly Glu X3 R34 X4 or X6 Asn X5 Gln X5 Glu X3 R38 X5 or X6 R39 X6 R40 X4 Arg X6 R42 R43 X5 or X6 R44 X8 X9 wherein X, X1, Xê, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7 and X8 are each either hydrogen or a protective group andX9 is either a protective group or an anchoring bond to resin support or des X9, in which case the residue at the C terminal has a carboxy moiety which is Y b splitting off the protective group or groups or anchoring bond from said peptide of the formula II and c if desired, converting a resulting peptide into a nontoxic salt thereof. In selecting a particular side chain protecting group to be used in the synthesis of the peptides, the following general rules are followed a the protecting group preferably retains its protecting properties and is not be split off under coupling conditions, b the protecting group should be stable to the reagent and, with the exception of Xan, is preferably stable under the reaction conditions selected for removing the amino protecting group at each step of the synthesis, and c the side chain protecting group must be removable, upon the completion of the synthesis containing the desired amino acid sequence, under reaction conditions that will not undesirably alter the peptide chain. When peptides are not prepared using recombinant DNA technology, they are preferably prepared using solid phase synthesis1 such as that generally described by Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 85, p 2149 1963 , although other equivalent chemical syntheses known in the art can also be used as previously mentioned. Solid phase synthesis is commenced from theC terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected amino acid to a suitable resin. Such a starting material can be prepared by attaching an O amino protected amino acid by an ester linkage to a chloromethylated resin or a hydroxymethyl resin, or by an amide bond to a BHA resin or MBHA resin. The preparation of the hydroxymethyl resin is described byBodansky et al., Chem. Ind. London 38, 1597 98 1966 . Chloromethylated resins are commercially available from Bio Rad Laboratories, Richmond,California and from Lab. Systems, Inc. The preparation of such a resin is described by Stewart et al., SolidPhase Peptide Synthesis Freeman Co., San Francisco 1969 , Chapter 1, pp 1 6. BHA and MBHA resin supports are commercially available and are generally used only when the desired polypeptide being synthesized has an unsubstituted amide at the C terminal. The C terminal amino acid, i.e. Asn, protected by BOC and by Xan, can be first coupled to the chloromethylated resin according to the procedure set forth in Chemistry Letters, K. Horiki et al. 165 168 1978 , using KF in D 4F at about 60 C. for 24 hours with stirring, when the 43 residue peptide is to be synthesized. Following the coupling of the BOC protected amino acid to the resin support, the i amino protecting group is removed, as by using trifluoroacetic acid TFA in methylene chloride or TFA alone. The deprotection is carried out at a temperature between about 0 C and room temperature.Other standard cleaving reagents, such as HC1 in dioxane, and conditions for removal of specific amino protecting groups may be used as described in Schroder Lubke, The Peptides , 1 pp 72 75 Academic Press 1965 . After removal of the 9amino protecting group, the remainingo amino and side chain protected amino acids are coupled step wise in the desired order to obtain the intermediate compound defined hereinbefore, or as an alternative to adding each amino acid separately in the synthesis, some of them may be coupled to one another prior to addition to the solid phase reactor. The selection of an appropriate coupling reagent is within the skill of the art. Particularly suitable as a coupling reagent is N,N dicyclohexyl carbodiimide DCCI . The activating reagents used in the solid phase synthesis of the peptides are well known in the peptide art. Examples of suitable activating reagents are carbodiimides, such as N,N diisopropylcarbodiimide and N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide. Other activating reagents and their use in peptide coupling are described by Schroder Lubke supra, in Chapter III and by Kapoor, J. Phar. Sci., 59, pp 1 27 1970 .I Each protected amino acid or amino acid sequence is introduced into the solid phase reactor in about a fourfold or more excess, and the coupling may be carried out in a medium of dimethylformamide DMF CH2C12 1 1 or in DMF or CH2C12 alone. In cases where incomplete coupling occurs, the coupling procedure is repeated before removal of the amino protecting group prior to the coupling of the next amino acid. The success of the coupling reaction at each stage of the synthesis, if performed manually, is preferably monitored by the ninhydrin reaction, as described by E. Kaiser et al., Anal. Biochem. 34, 595 1970 . The coupling reactions can be performed automatically, as on a Beckman 990 automatic synthesizer, using a program such as that reported inRivier et al.Biopolymers, 1978, 17, pp 1927 1938. After the desired amino acid sequence has been completed, the intermediate peptide can be removed from the resin support by treatment with a reagent, such as liquid hydrogen fluoride, which not only cleaves the peptide from the resin but also cleaves all remaining 2 3 4 5 side chain protecting groups X, X , X , X4, X5, X6, X7 and X8 and the anchoring bond X9 and also the amino protecting group X1 if one is used, to obtain the peptide in the form of the free acid. If Met is present in the sequence, the BOC protecting group is preferably first removed using trifluoroacetic acid TFA ethanedithiol prior to cleaving the peptide from the resin with HF to eliminate potentialS alkylation. When using hydrogen fluoride for cleaving, anisole and methylethyl sulfide are included as scavengers in the reaction vessel. The following Example sets forth a preferred method for synthesizing peptides by the solid phase technique. It will of course be appreciated that the synthesis of a correspondingly shorter peptide fragment is effected in the same manner by merely eliminating the requisite number of amino acids at either end of the chain however, it is presently felt that biologically active fragments should contain the indicated sequence at the N terminus. EXAMPLE I The synthesis of the peptide MeHis rhGRF 1 43 OH having the formula MeHis Ala Asp Ala Ile Phe Thr Ser Ser Tyr Arg Arg Ile Leu G1y Gln Leu Tyr Ala Arg Lys Leu Leu His Glu Ile Met Asn Arg Gln Gln GlyGlu Arg Asn Gln Glu Gln Arg Ser Arg Phe Asn OH is conducted in a stepwise manner using a Beckman 990 peptide synthesizer on a chloromethylated resin having a substitution range of about 0.1 to 0.5 mmoles g. resin.Coupling of BOC Asn Xan to the resin is performed by the general procedure set forth in Chemistry Letters, supra, using KF in DMF at about 600C. for 24 hours with stirring, and it results in the substitution of about 0.35 mmol. Asn per gram of resin. After deblocking and neutralization, the peptide chain is built step by step on the resin.Deblocking, neutralization and addition of each amino acid is performed in general accordance with the procedure set forth in detail in Rivier, J, J. Amer.Chem. Soc., 96, 2986 2992 1974 . All solvents that are used are carefully degassed by sparging with an inert gas, e.g. helium or nitrogen, to insure the absence of oxygen that might undesirably oxidize the sulfur of theMet residue. Deblocking is preferably carried out in accordance with Schedule A which follows SCHEDULE A Reagent Mixing time Min. 1. 60 TFA 2 ethanedithiol 10 2. 60 TFA 2 ethanedithiol 15 3. IPA 1 ethanedithiol 0.5 4. Et3N 10 in CH2C12 0.5 5. MeOH 0.5 6. Et3N 10 in CH2C12 0.5 7. MeOH twice 0.5 8. CH2C12 twice 0.5 The couplings are preferably carried out as set out in Schedule B which follows SCHEDULE B Reagent Mixing time Min. 9. DCCI 10. Boc amino acid 50 90 11. MeOH twice 0.5 12. CH2C12 twice 0.5 13. Ac2O 3M in CH2C12 15.0 14. CH2C12 0.5 15. MeOH 0.5 16. CH2C12 twice 0.5 Briefly, one to two mmol. of BOC protected amino acid in methylene chloride is used per gram of resin, plus one equivalent of 1.0 molar DCCI in methylene chloride for two hours. When BOC Arg TOS is being coupled, a mixture of 50 DMF and methylene chloride is used.Bzl ether is used as the hydroxyl side chain protecting group for Ser and Thr. The amido group of Asn or Gln is protected by Xan when DCC coupling is used as is preferred. P nitrophenyl ester OSp may also be used to activate the carboxyl end of Asn or Gln, and for example, BOC Asn ONp can be coupled overnight using one equivalent of HOBt in a 50 mixture of DMF and methylene chloride, in which case noDCC is added. 2 chloro benzyloxyearbonyl 2Cl Z is used as the protecting group for the Lys side chain. Tos is used to protect the guanidino group of Arg and the imidazole nitrogen of His, and the Glu or Asp side chain carboxyl group is protected with OBzl. The phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr is protected with 2,6 dichlorobenzyl DCB . At the end of the synthesis, the following composition is obtained 4 4 Ser 4 80C N seHis X Ala Asp X Ala Ile Phe Thr X Ser X Ser X43 Tyr X2 Arg X6 Arg X63 Ile Leu Gly Gln X Leu Tyr X2 Ala Arg X6 Lys X7 Leu Leu His X Glu X3 Ile Met Asn X5 Arg X6 Gln X5 Gln x5 Gly Glu X3 6 5 5 3 5 6 Arg X Asn X Gin X Glu X Gln X Arg X Ser X4 Arg X6 Phe Asn X5 9 wherein X is Tos,X2 is DCB, X3 is OBzl, X is Bzl, X5 is Xan, X is Tos, X7 is 2C1 Z and X is O CH2 resin support. Xan may have been partially or totally removed by TFA treatment used to deblock theO amino protecting group. In order to cleave and deprotect the protected peptide resin, it is treated with 1.5 ml. anisole, 0.5 ml. methylethylsulfide and 15 ml. hydrogen fluoride HF per gram of peptide resin, at 20eC. for one half hour and at o.ec. for one half hour. After elimination of the HF under high vacuum, the resin peptide remainder is washed alternately with dry dimethyl ether and chloroform, and the peptide is then extracted with degassed 2N aqueous acetic acid and separated from the resin by filtration.

Various of the synthetic peptides prepared in the Examples are compared with synthetic hpGRF 1 40 OH in in vitro assays, and all are found to exhibit generally greater potencies for the secretion of GH and similar intrinsic activities. To determine the effectiveness of several of the synthetic peptides to promote the release of growth hormone, in vitro assays are carried out using synthetic hpGRF 1 40 OH as a standard in side by side comparison with equimolar concentrations of the various other analogs and fragments synthesized. Cultures are used which include cells of rat pituitary glands removed some three to five days previously. Cultures which are considered optimal for the secretion of growth hormone are used for the comparative testing, in the general manner described in Vale et al. Endocrinology, 91, 562 572 1972 and as more particularly described inVale et al. Endocrinology, 1983 , in press.Incubation with the substance to be tested is carried out for 3 to 4 hours, and aliquots of the culture medium are removed and processed to measure their contents in immunoreactive GH ir GH by a well characterized radioimmunoassay. The results of this comparative testing for equimolar concentrations are shown in Table I. TABLE IPeptide Comparison hpGRF 1 40 OH standard for this test 100 25 27 D Glu , Nle rGRF l 29 NH 31 N1e27 2 271CD Leu , Nle rGRF 1 29 H2 160 17 27 D Leu , Nle rGRF 1 29 NH2 1 MePhe1 138 N MePhe1 hpGRF 1 32 NH2 12 1 3 12 Ce MePhe 4Cl l hpGRF 1 NH 4.7 4Cl Phe hpGRF 1 32 NH2 2 In vitro testing of these synthetic peptides shows that they each have the full intrinsic biological activity of hpGRF 1 40 OH. The maximum effective 27 concentration for D Leu23, Nle hpGRF 1 29 NH2 is about 1 nanomolar. In addition to the in vitro tests for secretion of growth hormone, in vivo experiments inject the synthetic peptides through an indwelling catheter into freely running normal male rats after pretreating them with FLA 63, a dopamine hydroxylase inhibitor that suppresses spontaneous GH secretion without affecting the response to exogenous GRF. Blood samples are taken through the same catheter immediately prior to and 5 and 20 minutes after injections.GH levels in blood, measured by radioimmunoassay, show that synthetic 27 D Leu23, Nle rGRF 1 29 NH2, other D Leu17 and D Glu25 analogs of rGRF and the above identified N Me and C alpha Me analogs of hpGRF 1 32 NH2 are powerful stimulators of the secretion of pituitary GH and have substantially longer duration than rGRF 1 29 NH2 and hpGRF 1 32 NH2, respectively. Other known GRF in vivo tests, that are known to be effective to detect secretion of GH, are used to confirm these results.Dosages between about 100 nanograms and about 50 micrograms of these peptides per Kg. of body weight are considered to be effective in causing GH secretion. Such synthetic hpGRF analogs and possibly rGRF and pGRF analogs should be useful for human applications in which a physician wishes to elevate GH production.Stimulation of GH secretion by such analogs is of interest in patients with complete or relative GH deficiency caused by underproduction of endogenous GRF.Furthermore, it is probable that increased GH secretion and its attendant increase in growth could be obtained in humans or animals with normal GH levels. Moreover, administration should alter body fat content and modify other GH dependent metabolic, immunologic and developmental processes. For example, these analogs may be useful as a means of stimulating anabolic processes in human beings under circumstances such as following the incurring of burns. As another example, these analogs may be administered to commercial warm blooded animals, such as chickens, turkeys, pigs, goats, cattle and sheep, and may be used in aquiculture for raising fish and other cold blooded marine animals, e.g. sea turtles and eels, and amphibians, to accelerate growth and increase the ratio of protein to fat gained by feeding effective amounts of the peptides. For administration to humans, these synthetic peptides should have a purity of at least about 93 and preferably at least 98 . Purity, for purposes of this application, refers to the intended peptide constituting the stated weight of all peptides and peptide fragments present. For the administration of such synthetic peptides to commercial and other animals in order to promote growth and reduce fat content, a purity as low as about 5 , or even as low as 0.01 , may be acceptable. These synthetic peptides or the nontoxic salts thereof, combined with a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier to form a pharmaceutical composition, may be administered to animals, including humans, either intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, percutaneously, e.g. intranasally or even orally. The administration may be employed by a physician to stimulate the release of GH where the host being treated requires such therapeutic treatment. The required dosage will vary with the particular condition being treated, with the severity of the condition and with the duration of desired treatment. Such peptides are often administered in the form of nontoxic salts, such as acid addition salts or metal complexes, e.g., with zinc, iron or the like which are considered as salts for purposes of this application . Illustrative of such acid addition salts are hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, phosphate, maleate, acetate, citrate, benzoate, succinate, malate, ascorbate, tartrate and the like. If the active ingredient is to be orally administered in tablet form, the tablet may contain a binder, such as tragacanth, corn starch or gelatin a disintegrating agent, such as alginic acid and a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate. If administration in liquid form is desired, sweetening and or flavoring may be used, and intravenous administration in isotonic saline, phosphate buffer solutions or the like may be effected. The peptides should be administered to humans under the guidance of a physician, and pharmaceutical compositions will usually contain the peptide in conjunction with a conventional, solid or liquid, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Usually, the parenteral dosage will be from about 100 nanograms to about 50 micrograms of the peptide per kilogram of the body weight of the host. Although the invention has been described with regard to its preferred embodiments, which constitute the best mode presently known to the inventors, it should be understood that various changes and modifications as would be obvious to one having the ordinary skill in this arty may be made without departing from the scope of the invention which is set forth in the claims appended hereto. For example, modifications in the peptide chain, particularly deletions beginning at the carboxyl terminal of the peptide, can be made in accordance with the known experimental practises to date to create peptides or peptide fragments that retain all or very substantial portions of the biological potency of the peptide, and such peptides are considered as being within the scope of the invention. Moreover, additions may be made to either terminal, or to both terminals, and or generally equivalent residues can be substituted for naturally occurring residues, as is well known in the overall art of peptide chemistry, to produce other analogs having at least a substantial portion of the potency of the claimed polypeptide without deviating from the scope of the invention.
