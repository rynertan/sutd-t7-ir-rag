## Description
Device for recovering heat from domestic water Means are also provided for ensuring only drain water with a temperature higher than the water already in the storage tank is fed into it, as well as means enabling the storage tank to be cleaned periodically. The present invention relates to a device for recovering heat from domestic water, comprising a compressor for compressing refrigerating fluid, a condenser for condensing the refrigerating fluid from the compressor, an expander for expanding the refrigerating fluid from the condenser and evaporating means for evaporating the refrigerating fluid from the expander. In recent times, an increasing need has been felt for saving energy, including that which has up to now always been wasted. It is a well known fact that one of the major sources of waste is the heat contained in hot water drained from household appliances and the heat generated by the said appliances during operation. The energy consumed by household heating appliances in particular immersion heaters, dishwashers, washing machines, stoves, etc. amounts to about 50 of total consumption, almost all of which is currently being wasted. Household appliances, however, are faced with three major problems how to reduce energy consumption electricity and fuel how to reduce water heating time on appliances such as washing machines or dish washers by reducing the wash cycle how to incentivate nighttime consumption of electricity by charging lower rates and so reduce peakhour demand. Various systems have already been devised for recovering the heat contained in drain water, e.g. heat exchangers and heat pump systems. As no storage tank is provided for, however, the said heat exchangers only recover heat when the water is actually drained off Heat pump systems are available for recovering the heat contained in domestic drain water but these are fairly complex and only designed for groups of flats installations, For example, in the document FR A 2 312 735 a plant is described for recovering heat from domestic drain waters, suitable for use in a whole building, furnished with a unique centralized hydraulic main for the drainage of the waste water and a unique centralized main for the supply to the different users of hot water heated by the described plant. Consequently the object of FR A 2 312 735 is unsuitable for installation in a flat room like the kitchen or the bathroom since it is conceived to be used in centralized mains and, should it be installed in a flat room, it would require several structural modifications to the hydraulic plant of the house, not to mention its unsuitable dimensions and the capacity of heat recovery it offers. Others entail major alterations to existing household appliances and are so complex as to jeopardize working efficiency. The proposals indicating the possibility of recovering heat supplied by the condenser of a refrigerator and or a freezer to heat the water for sanitary use are cited as an example.These solutions, though, cause the functioning of the refrigerator to be very difficult and critical which does not work any more at its best because of the sudden variations in temperature that are produced in the medium in which the condenser of the refrigerating circuit is immersed. It must be remembered that the sizing of the refrigerating circuit is strictly connected to the capacity of heat exchange of the condenser, that when immersed in air that has a low heat conductivity does not suffer much from the variations in temperature in the medium in which is immersed but when immersed in water that has higher heat conductivity it suffers much from the variations in temperature of the water around it cold when piped in and hot at the end of the heating process. These drawbacks result in their being used on a very small scale.On a cost advantage basis, in fact, they only provide for saving over a very long period of time much longer than the expected troublefree running period. Consequently, these systems are rarely used and may as well not have been invented. The aim of the present invention is to overcome these drawbacks by providing a heat pvmp device for recovering the heat contained in hot and or cold drain water which provides for reducing the total amount of energy required for heating the water, for shifting energy consumption to cheaper rate times, for reducing the wash cycle time of appliances such as washing machines and dish washers, and which can be used on appliances currently sold on the market. Further aims of the present invention are to ensure that the said device is simple, reliable and cheap. With these aims in view, the present invention relates to a device for recovering heat from domestic water, comprising a compressor for compressing refrigerating fluid, a condenser for condensing the refrigerating fluid from the compressor, an expander for expanding the refrigerating fluid from the condenser and evaporating means for evaporating the refrigerating fluid from the expander, characterised by the fact that the said condenser is fitted inside a cistern filled with the water to be heated and by the fact that the said evaporator is fitted inside a storage tank fed with domestic water and in which the said water is kept long enough for it to yield enough heat to fall below a given minimum temperature. The invention will now be described with reference to the attached drawings, provided by way of a non limiting example, in which Fig. 1 shows a working diagram of a preferred arrangement of the present invention Fig. 2 shows a first working arrangement of the preferred Fig. 1 set up of the present invention Fig. 3 shows a second working arrangement of the preferred Fig. 1 set up Fig. 4 shows a part diagram of a second preferred arrangement of the present invention Fig. 5 shows the electric diagram of an elec tronic circuit for controlling the operating cycle of the device in the preferred Fig. 4 arrangement. Fig. 1 shows a water storage tank 1 of roughly 80 100 litre capacity with a level indicator 2, a first thermostat 3, two drain water inlets 4,5, an overflow 6 and outlet 7. Storage tank 1 is fitted inside with an evaporator 8 for a heat pump circuit which also comprises a capillary tube 9, condenser 10 and compressor 11. The capacity of evaporator 8 is such as to extract enough heat from the drain water to bring it down to a temperature of 4 60C and therefore requires no defrosting device. Condenser 10 is fitted inside cistern of a water heater 12 which has a second thermostat 13, an inlet 14 for cold water from the mains 15 and a hot water outlet 16. Compressor 11 is placed in thermal contact with the walls and the water in cistern of the water heater 12 so as to yield the heat generated during operation to the cistern. Pipe 17 connects the drain 18 of a dish or clothes washing machine 19 to inlet 5 on storage tank 1, while pipe 40 inside the said storage tank 1 feeds the said drain water into the bottom part of storage tank 1. The said dish or clothes washing machine 19 is supplied with cold water from the mains 15 through pipe 20 and electrovalve 21 and with hot water from cistern 12 through a first pipe 22, a second pipe 23 and a second electrovalve 24. Pipe 25 connects overflow 6 on storage tank 1 to the main system drain 26, while another pipe 27 connects drain 7 on storage tank 1 to main system drain 26 via pump 28. Pipe 29 forms a bypass through valve 30 to feed water from drain 31 in sink 32 to inlet 4 on storage tank 1, while a second pipe 33 forms a second by pass through a second valve 34 to feed water from drain 31 in sink 32 to main drain 26. Obviously, when one by pass is open, the other is closed.Sink 32 is supplied with water from a cold water tap 35 connected to the mains 15 via pipe 36 and by a hot water tap 37 connected to drain 16 on cistern of the water heater 12 by pipes 38 and 22. Cold water is also supplied to cistern 12 from the mains 15 by pipe 39 and inlet 14 on cistern 12 itself. Figs. 2 and 3 show two different working ar rangements of the device for recovering heat from drain water. The parts common to Fig. 1 are numbered in the same way. Fig. 2 shows a traditional arrangement with the dish or clothes washing machine 19 fitted under the draining board of sink 32 with storage tank 1 fitted under the sink drain. Water heater 12 is wall mounted and supplies hot water to both dish or clothes washing machine 19 and tap 37 through pipe 16. The Fig. 3 arrangement can be used anywhere there is a tap with no need for making holes or running pipes through the wall. Water heaters 12 is fitted under the draining board of sink 32 with storage tank 1 under the sink drain and dish or clothes washing trachine 19 to the side of the sink. To explain how this first preferred arrangement cf the heat recovering device covered by the present invention works, we shall start with by pass 29 30 open and by pass 33 34 closed normal situation in which water is drained from sink 32 into storage tank 1 . As already mentioned, storage tank 1 is also supplied with drain water from dish or clothes washing machine 19. The duty cycle of storage tank 1 is as follows Compressor 11, and consequently also the heat pump, run as long as the temperature of the water inside storage tank 1 is over 4 60C. When running, the heat pump takes heat from the water in storage tank 1 and supplies it to the water in cistern of the water heater 12. When the temperature of the water in storage tank 1 falls to 4 60C, thermostat 3 stops compressor 11 and activates pump 28 which empties storage tank 1. The minimum temperature is set so low to enable heat to be extracted from cold water as well, i.e. from mains 15, which is usually over 60C and so ensure the device is exploited fully.However, if hotter drain water is received even if the water in storage tank 1 has not reached 4 60C , pump 28 is started up just the same and empties storage tank 1 so that it can be filled with the said hot drain water.This is made possible by a differential thermostat described in detail in Fig. 5 consisting of an electronic circuit which measures the temperature difference between the in coming drain water and the water already in storage tank 1. When the in coming water is hotter than the water in storage tank 1, it activates pump 28. In a simpler solution, pump 28 may be activated by the timer on dish or clothes washingmachine 19 so that, when water is fed in, it activates pump 28 to empty storage tank 1 which will soon be replenished again with hot drain water. When the water in cistern 12 reaches the required temperature, thermostat 13 stops compressor 11 on the heat pump. The high capacity of storage tank 1 and the above operating mode provide for maximum exploitation of the heat recovery device. In fact, when hot drain water is fed in, storage tank 1 is emptied so it can be filled with hotter water than it already contains and so enable more heat to be recovered. If hot drain water fails to be supplied for a long period of time, the system keeps running by recovering heat from cold water. What is more, the position of compressor 11, in thermal contact with cistern 12 and the water inside, ensures the operating heat generated by compressor 11 is supplied to the water inside cistern 12 so as to heat it. Dish or clothes washing machine 19 can run on either cold water from mains 15 or hot water from cistern 12, thus reducing both consumption and wash cycle time. Electrovalves 21 and 24 for tapping hot or cold water are activated by the timer on dish or clothes washingmachine 19.Should users not wish to operate a more complex machine than those currently available on the market, the heat recovery device may be used just the same for kitchen purposes or standard dish and clothes washing machines by feeding hot water from cistern 12 into the single inlet. In this way, all the wash stages including rinsing are performed using hot water which, though involving slightly higher consumption, provides for a more efficient wash. Various alterations may be made to the heat recovery device described which consist in fitting cistern 12 with an electric heating resistor, located halfway up the cistern, a manual switch and an extra thermostat in fitting storage tank 1 with two pressure switches, one for maximum and one for minimum pressure, and in extending pipe 40 into an L shape so that drain water is fed into the bottom centre section of storage tank 1. The changes to the operating cycle already described are as follows When hot drain water is fed in from dish or clothes washing machine 19, by means of suitable settings on the two pressure switches, storage tank 1 is not emptied completely, but only by the same amount of water about 25 30 litres that is fed in this is the usual amount of water drained off after a dish or clothes washing machine cycle . As the water in storage tank 1 is arranged in layers , that is, cold at the bottom and hot at the top, drain 7 has been located at the bottom. A partial drain off only dumps the colder water from storage tank 1 so that further heat may be recovered from the remaining hotter water.The advantage of a partial drain off is that colder water is replaced by hot drain water which provides for improving the efficiency of the heat recovery device even further. L shaped pipe 40 provides for no need of emptying storage tank 1, even partially, when hot drain water is fed in from dish or clotheswashing machine 19. The way this is achieved is by means of the drain pump on the said dish or clotheswashing machine 19 which pumps in the said hot drain water under pressure so as to push the colder water at the bottom of storage tank 1 upwards and ot through overflow 25.Further advantages of this solution are that the said hot drain water is pumped over evaporator 8 so as to improve heat exchange between evaporator 8 and the said drain water and that it provides for eliminating any grease floating on the surface of the drain water in storage tank 1 which is the first to flow out of overflow 25. If the heat recovery device has been de activated, the electro resistor halfway up cistern 12, which is activated by means of a manual switch, provides for heating the water quickly roughly 1 hour after the device is switched on again. The reason hot water can be obtained so quickly is that only half of the water in cistern 12 is heated. After this first stage, the additional thermostat disconnects the electric resistor and starts the heat recovery cycle which heats all the water in cistern 12. If, for any reason, the said heat recovery device needs to be disconnected, all that need be done is to shut off by pass pipe 29 30, open by pass pipe 33 34 and drain water from dish or clothes washing machine 19 into sink 32. Fig. 4 shows a storage tank 101 with a pipe 102 running across the top which also acts as an inlet pipe a first outlet pipe 103 running up from the bottom of storage tank 1 a second outlet pipe 104 which also sucks up water from the bottom of the said tank and has a slot 105 on top which acts as an overflow a pump 106, at the bottom of storage tank 101 near the inlet of outlet pipe 103, which is fitted with refuse mincing blades 107 a pipe 108 closed at the end terminating inside storage tank 101 and fitted with spray nozzles 109 a pressure switch 110 which detects the pressure between the top and bottom of storage tank 101 a temperature sensor 111 a hole for detergent 112, normally closed by cap 113, and part of a refri gerator condenser 114 the other part of which not shown in the diagram is exposed to the air.One end of pipe 102 is connected to syphon 115 on sink 116 which also has an inlet 117 for drain water from dishor clothes washing machine not shown in the diagram.The other end of pipe 102 joins up with the main drain on the device not shown in the diagram either . Pipe 102 has a hole 118 which connects it to storage tank 101 and is fitted with a gate valve 119 controlled by electric motor 121 the shaft of which is fitted with a cam wheel not shown in the diagram and temperature sensor 120. Electric motor 121 has a 20 Kg cm torque, can turn both ways and is controlled by an electric circuit shown in Fig. 5 for opening and closing gate valve 119. As the said opening and closing mechanism is fitted inside storage tank 101, it need not be perfectly airtight in that ariy leakage is collected in the said storage tank 101. Pipe 108 is connected via tap 122 to drain pipe 103. Part 114 of the refrigerator condenser gives off heat to the water in storage tank 101.The size of the said condenser section poses various problems which have already been dealt with inItalian Patent Application No. 67288 A 81 of March 3rd, 1981, filed by the present applicant. The ends of drain pipes 103 and 104 not connected to storage tank 1t terminate in the main drain on the device. Fig. 4 also shows a cistern of the water heater 120 with a thermostat 124 whereas it does not show the heat pump with an evaporator inside storage tank 101 and a condenser inside cistern 123. As storage tank 101 is usually filled with medium to low temperature water, only light lagging is required. To explain how the device shown in Fig. 4 works, we shall start with gate valve 119 in the closed position. If pipe 102 feeds in drain water the temperature of which is detected by sensor 120 hotter than the water already inside storage tank 101 the temperature of which is detected by sensor 111 , gate valve 119 remains closed and the said drain water flows into storage tank 101 through hole 118 on pipe 102. At the same time, the water at the bottom of storage tank 101 the colder layer is drained off through pipe 104 into the main drain on the device, while part of the surface water with any grease and or oil floating on the top is drained off into the main drain through calibrated slot 105 on pipe 104.The colder layer of water in storage tank 101 is thus replaced with hotter drain water and any grease and or oil is removed. If the in coming drain water is colder than the water already inside storage tank 101, gate valve 119 opens and the said drain water by passes storage tank 101 to flow into the main drain. If gate valve 119 had been open in the first instance, it would have closed and would have remained open in the second. How this is made possible will be described when we come to operation of the circuit shown in Fig. 5. Storage tank 101 remains full as long as the temperature of the water inside is over 50C. When it falls below temperature, pump 106 is started up to empty storage tank 101 through drain pipe 105. Tap 122 is normally open as in this case .At the same time, pump 106 chops up any solid refuse at the bottom of storage tank 101 by means of blades 107 so as to empty it more easily. At this point, water is sucked up from the mains usually over 50C by means of pressure switch 110 and the storage tank is filled up again. Should the temperature of the mains water, for any reason, fall below or close to 50C, to prevent this from being sent into circulation, a variation also provides for a thermostat on the mains inlet pipe which only allows water to flow in from the mains at a specific temperature. This operating arrangement also provides for recovering heat from the mains alone so that, even if hot drain water is not supplied for a long period of time, cistern of the water heater 123 contains usable hot water just same. The heat pump is turned on and off by thermostat 124 on cistern 123 and stays on as long as the temperature of the water in cistern 123 remains below 450C and goes off when this temperature is exceeded.The heat pump and storage tank filling and emptying cycles are independent in that storage tank 101 is practically always full of water over 50C whereas the heat pump comes on or goes off when the temperature of the water in cistern 123 is below or over 45do. A variation may provide for the heat recovery device to operate so that, when the temperature of the water in storage tank 101 exceeds 300C, the maximum temperature of the water in cistern 123 is raised to 520C and the heat pump is only stopped if this new maximum is exceeded or if the temperature of the water in storage tank 101 falls below 250C. This is guaranteed by thermostat 124, temperature sensor 111 and an electronic circuit which is so simple it needs no explanation. As dirty water inevitably settles in storage tank 101 and dirt may cling to the evaporator on the heat pump thus affecting heat exchange efficiency between the said evaporator and the drain water, a device is provided for cleaning storage tank 101 which consists of a hole 112 for detergent, a pipe 108 with spray nozzles 109, a tap 122, a push button not shown in the diagram for activating pump 106. To clean tank 101, tap 1 is turned off, detergent is poured in and pump 106 started up. In this way, the water in storage tank 101 is forced by pump 106 into pipe 108 and sprayed over the walls of storage tank 101 and the heat pump evaporator so as to clean them. This is a manual operation that can be performed whenever needed. Fig. 5 shows the electronic circuit controlling operation of the heat recovery device as shown in theFig. 4 solution. It consists of a cam wheel, 130, integral with the shaft on electric motor 121 poles marked 131 and with gate valve 119, which controls a two position blade switch 132 whose middle contact is connected to a V positive supply. The side terminal 150 is cl .nt tl d t.o input .a c.f NAND gate 37, to one end of resistor 134, whose other end is grounded, and to the anode of diode 135. Side terminal 151 is connected to input a of NAND gate 136, to one end of resistor 137, whose other end is grounded, and to the anode of diode 138.One terminal of temperature sensor 111 is grounded while the other terminal is connected to the non inverting input of threshold comparator 139 and to one end of resistor 140, the other end of which is connected to a V supply. One terminal of temperature sensor 120 is grounded while the other terminal is connected to the inverting input of threshold comparator 139 and to one end of resistor 141, the other end of which is also connected to a V supply. The output of threshold comparator 139 is connected to input b of NAND gate 136, to input b of NAND gate 142 and to one end of resistor 143, the other end of which is connected to a V supply. Input a of NAND gate 142 is connected to the V supply and its output to input b of NAND gate 133. The output of NAND gate 133 is connected to the base of PNP transistor 145 via resistor 144. The emitter of transistor 145 is connected to the V supply while the collector is connected to a terminal on electric motor 121, the other terminal of which is grounded. The output of NAND gate 136 is connected to the base of PNP transistor 147 via resistor 146. The emitter of transistor 147 is connected to the V supply while the collector is connected to the ungrounded terminal on electric motor 121. The cathodes of diodes 135 and 138 are connected together and to one end of resistor 148 the other end of which is grounded and connected to the base of PNP transistor 149. The emitter of transistor 149 is connected to the V supply while the collector is connected to the ungrounded terminal on electric motor 121. The circuit shown in Fig. 5 operates as follows When the temperature of inzoming drain water detected by sensor 120 is higher than that of the water in storage tank 101 detected by sensor 111 , the output of threshold comparator 139 will be logic l which is transmitted to input b of NAND gates 136 and 142. If gate valve 119 is closed, cam wheel 130 keeps terminal 150 on switch 132 connected to the V supply as shown in Fig. 5 so that input a of NAND gate 136 is logic 0, input a of NAND gate 133 is logic 1 and diode 135 logic 1.In such a condition, the output of NAND gate 136 will be high and the output of NADF gate 14 lowBut, as the output of NAND gate 133 is alsc high, all three transistors, 145, 147 and 149, are dIsabled, motor 121 remains off and gate valve 119 closed so that drain water can flow into storage tank 101 through hole 118. If, on the other hand, gate valve 119 had been open, cam wheel 130 would have turned 900 and contact 151 on switch 132 would have been connected to the V supply. In such a condition, input 2via of NAND gate 136 is logic 1 and, as input b of the same NAND gate 136 is also logic 1 sent by threshold comparator 139 , its output is low, transistor 147 starts conducting and motor 121 starts up to turn gate valve 119 and cam wheel 130. When the centre contact on switch 132 turns to disconnect contact 151 from the V supply, input a of NAND gate 136 is no longer logic 1 but logic 0 which disables transistor 147. Both diodes 135 and 138, however, are now sent a logic 0 which starts transistor 149 conducting while motor 121 continues running. When, as it continues moving round, cam wheel 130 pushes the centre contact on switch 132 against contact 150, the condition described at the outset is restored, motor 121 stops and gate valve 119 closes.If in coming drain water is colder than the water in storage tank 101, the output of threshold comparator 139 is low so that inputs b of NAND gates 136 and 133 are logic 1. If gate valve 119 is closed contact 150 on switch 132 connected to the V supply , input a of NAND gate 136 will be logic 0, its output will be high and transistor 147 disabled. The output of NAND gate 142 and also inputs b and a of NAND gate 133 will be high so that the latter s output will be low, transistor 145 will start conducting and motor 121 will start running. When neither contact 150 nor 151 on switch 132 is connected to the V supply, transistor 149, via diodes 135 and 138, provides for supplying motor 121 which only stops when the centre contact on switch 132 connects contact 151 to the V supply, that is, when gate valve 119 is open. In much the same way, provision can be made so that, if gate valve 119 had been open, motor 121 would not have started up and gate valve 119 would have remained open. We may sum up by saying that, when one of the side contacts 150, 151 on switch 132 is connected to the V supply, the present device has only four stable positions in which gate valve 119 is open or closed.In all the other intermediate positions, transistor 145 and diodes 135 and 138 always provide for keeping motor 121 and gate valve 119 running until a stable balanced position is found. To conclude, the circuit described ensures gate valve 119 is always closed or open when in coming drain water is hotter or colder respectively than the water in storage tank 101. An interesting point to note is that, in both solutions, heat is recovered in a continuous cycle , that is, the same heat is recovered several times.Therefore, if it was not for losses on the system , the required amount of water could be kept permanentlv hot, the only consumption being that of the heat pump on the compressor. Further alterations can be made to the heat recovery device covered by the present invention. For example, a dish and clothes washing machine could be connected parallel so as to collect drain water from both. Another could be to empty the storage tank 1, 101 every 2 3 days, regardless of its operating cycles, so as to prevent dirt from collecting inside.Another could be to fit the compressor with a timer which only starts it up at specific times, e.g. at night, so as to benefit from special electricity rates where these exist. Another could be to sink the compressor inside the cistern of the water heater the only precaution being to arrange the terminal board at the bottom. This would provide for improving thermal exchange between the compressor and the water in the cistern. In fact, the latter would contribute to cooling and improving operation of the compressor. To show just how much can be saved using the present invention, the following are the results obtained on working prototypes. Tests were run using a dish washing machine capable of washing 30 plates, equivalent to 15.9 Kg, and 80 litre cistern and the heat recovery device described above with an 80 litre storage tank. Testing commenced with cistern 12 full of water at 560C and storage tank 1 3 4 full of water at 150C.Dish washing machine 19 was started up and, at the end of the wash cycle, we got the following results water in cistern 12 340C water in storage tank 1 380C amount of water drawn off dish washing machine 19 73.S litres consumption of dish washing machine 19 1.9 KWh After waiting for the water in cistern 12 to return to 560C by recovering heat from the water in storage tank 1, 53 litres of water were drawn off and the hot drain water emptied into storage tank 1 which had previously been emptied. Results after drawing off the water water in cistern 12 360 water in storage tank 1 420C To get back to the starting condition, we then waited for the water in cistern 12 to return to 569C, again by recovering heat from the water in storage tank 1. During the overall test 7 hours 25 minutes , compressor 11, which was running all the time, consumed 2 KWh making a total consumption figure of 1.9 2 3.g KWh for a complete dish washing cycle and 53 litres of water at 56 C which was drawn off in the test but could have been used for kitchen purposes.The same performance without. the heat recovery device would have required 3.25 KWh for dish washing machine 19 starting with cold water 53 x 56 15 860 2.52 KWh to bring the water in cistern 12 up to 560C roughly 0.53 KWh for losses on cistern 12 making a total consumrtion figure of 3.25 2.53 0.53 6.30 KWh. An other words, to obtain a given performance, we consumed 6.30 KWh using the traditional system and 3.90 KWh using the heat recovery device covered by the present invention, which amounts to a saving of 6.30 3.90 KWh or 38 100 x 2.40 6.30 38 . Another important fact to note is that the wash cycle of the dish washing machine was reduced. The advantages of the heat recovery device hovered by the present invention will be clear from the description given. In particular, the possibility of saving energy for heating water, of operating equipment at specific times, of reducing the duty cycle time of dish or clothes washing machines, of reducing the power of the heating resistors on such machines, of using the device on standard household appliances with few or even no alterations needed, and, finally, the simple design and low cost of the device itself. To those skilled in the art it will be clear that numerous alterations can be made to the invention described by way of a non limiting example without, however, departing from the scope of the present invention.
