# Magnetic head air bearing slider and electromagnetic actuator assembly.

## Abstract
An air bearing magnetic head slider 10 is attached to the coil 241 of an electromagnetic actuator. Permanent magnets 28 are positioned in a stationary frame 30 to provide a magnetic field adjacent to the coil. When current is supplied to the coil, it moves within a slot 32 in the frame between the permanent magnets and transports the head slider accordingly. In this way, the magnetic head slider is actuated to access data tracks on a magnetic disk. Another magnetic head slider and actuator assembly comprises an X shanped shuttle 110 movable within a slotted portion 124 of a frame 126 within which permanent magnets 1281 are positioned. The shuttle 110 supports an electrical coil 116 for interaction with the smagnetic flux provided by the magnets 128 , and suspen sions 118 120 on which magnetic head sliders 122 are mounted.

## Description
MAGNETIC HEAD AIR BEARING SLIDER AND ELECTROMAGNETIC ACTUATOR ASSEMBLY This invention relates to assemblies comprising an electromagnetic actuator and a magnetic head air bearing slider for use in accessing magnetic disk files. In prior art disk files, the head accessing system includes magnetic transducers, air bearing head sliders to which the transducers are attached, head suspensions on which the sliders are mounted, head arms to which the suspensions are joined, and an actuator, such as a voice coil motor, coupled to the entire assembly. It is apparent that a system of this type has many components, requires many manufacturing steps and processes, and is costly to manufacture and maintain. Also, the magnitude of the moving mass used for accessing to data tracks on a disk surface limits the accessing speed. Other problems, such as misalignment, skewing, dynamic resonances, inter alia, are experienced with such accessing systems. This invention seeks to provide a magnetic head slider and actuator assembly which is cheaper to manufacture and performs better than conventional assemblies employed in disk files. An assembly comprising an electromagnetic actuator and an air bearing slider attached to the coil of the electromagnetic actuator so that the position of the slider is determined by the position of the coil in the actuator, the electromagnetic actuator comprising a frame supporting permanent magnets and defining a pathway for movement of the actuator coil upon interaction of current through the coil and the magnetic field produced by the permanent magnets, is characterised according to the invention in that the actuator coil and the air bearing head slider are disposed alongside one another so that they are not separated from one another along the path of movement of the actuator coil slider assembly. The invention will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a rear view, partly broken away, of a first magnetic head slider and actuator assembly embodying the invention FIGURE 2 is a side view of the assembly of FIGURE 1 FIGURE 3 is a section on A A in FIGURE 1 FIGURE 4 is a section on B B in FIGURE 2 FIGURE 5 is an enlarged broken away rear view of the head slider and the electrical coil FIGURE 6 is a side view corresponding to FIGURE 5 FIGURE 7 represents a disk drive assembly employing the assembly represented in the foregoing FIGURES FIGURE 8 is an oblique view of a second magnetic head slider and actuator assembly embodying the invention FIGURE 9 is a side view of a disk file, incorporating the assembly ofFIGURE 8 FIGURE 10 is an end section on line C C taken through FIGURE 8 and FIGURE 11 is a section on line D D taken through FIGURE 10. With reference to FIGURES 1 and 2, which depict a first embodiment of this invention, a magnetic head slider and actuator assembly comprises a head slider 10 having rails 12 and 14 and a recess 15 at an air bearing surface. This air bearing is of the type described in U.S. Patent Specification No. 3,855,625 and flies at a controlled low head disk spacing without any external force being applied. Magnetic transducers 16 are mounted to the trailing end 18 of the slider 10 for transducing interaction with a magnetic disk 20. A rectangular rigid wire coil 24 is supported on a core or former 26, that is thicker than the coil and which may be made of ceramic The wire coil 24 is embedded in epoxy for example, and is joined to the slider by a connecting cross spring pivot 22, illustrated in detail inFIGURES 5 and 6. The cross spring pivot 22 acts as a friction free hinge that allows the coil to move free of the slider. Also, the slider moves free of the coil, so that the slider may follow the topography of the disk surface without restriction from the coil. The coil 24 is oriented so that its rectangular plane extends perpendicularly from the slider surface and is aligned radially in the direction of accessing, as indicated by the bidirectional arrow inFIGURE 1. The wire coil 24 is connected to a current source not shown that provides bidirectional current of different magnitudes so that the coil and the slider may be actuated to move in a defined direction for a given distance to a selected data track on the disk surface. To achieve the actuation, magnetic flux is provided by sets of permanent magnets 28 FIGURE 3 that are positioned in a stationary frame 30 fixed to a housing. One set of permanent magnets 28 is disposed to co operate with one end of the coil. The other set of permanent magnets, which is reversed in polarity relative to the first set of permanent magnets, is disposed to co operate with the other end of the coil. The polarity reversal is required because the current at the opposing coil ends flows in opposite directions. Together with the permanent magnets, a linear actuator is formed for driving the slider, which is joined to the coil, bidirectionally in a radial accessing path across the surface of the disk.The rectangular planar type coil fits into a slot 32 within the rigid frame so that the coil is freely movable, The coil is limited in its travel to one half of the coil length, so as to maintain interaction with the correct polarities of the magnets. Stops may be provided to prevent escape of the coil from the slot. Air passages 40 are provided within the frame to allow air, under pressure, to reach orifices 42 in the walls of the slot 32. The air bearing pressure is obtained from a blower not shown attached to the housing in which the frame is positioned. The core 26 has grooves 46 in each face aligned with the orifices 42. The grooves 46 distribute the air from the orifices uniformly over the bearing faces of the coil core independent of the radial position of the slider and coil assembly. The air sustains an air bearing between the walls of the slot and the flat surfaces of the coil core 26. With reference to FIGURE 4, which is a section on B B of FIGURE 2, a flexible lead wire cable 34 is fastened at one end 36 to the slider 10 and at its other end 38 to the stationary frame. The lead wires connect to the actuator coil 24 and to the coils of the magnetic heads or transducers 16 disposed on the air bearing slider 10. The flexibility of the wire cable allows the unfastened portion to roll along the surfaces of the frame and slider, as the slider is moved with the coil actuator. FIGURES 5 and 6 illustrate the detail of the cross spring pivot connection 22 between the slider 10 and actuator coil structure 24. The pivot connection 22 is formed with two cross spring strips 60 that are attached to an extension 62 of the slider. When the coil 24 moves to access and then follow the disk tracks, the spring strips 60 serve as a mechanical hinge so that the slider motion across the disk precisely follows the coil movement, but is not unduly affected by the disk flutter or uneven topography of the disk. FIGURE 7 represents a disk drive assembly that employs the slider and actuator assembly of FIGURES 1 to 6. A plurality of magnetic disks 20 are mounted to a spindle hub 50 for rotation relative to accessing sliders 10 coupled to respective coil actuators 52 which are disposed within slots of a fixed frame 30. The frame is attached to a pedestal 56 that is securely seated on a baseplate 58. The slider and actuator assemblies are movable bidirectionally relative to the disk surfaces for recording and accessing data on different data tracks. The actuators and sliders may be energised separately or as a group depending on the electrical connections to drive current sources.Only one group of slider and actuator assemblies and associated frame are shown for the purpose of convenience, but it should be understood that additional assemblies and frames may be employed with this disk drive configuration. With reference to FIGURE 8, another magnetic head slider and actuator assembly comprises an X shaped support shuttle 110 formed by intersecting planar parts 112 and 114, which may be made of ceramic, for example. The horizontal part 112 supports a rectangular coil 116 wound around its periphery, whereas the vertical part 114 supports spring suspensions 118 and 120 which are attached at opposite edges of the part 114. Head sliders 122 are disposed at the ends of the spring suspensions for transducing interaction with rotating magnetic disks 136, as illustrated in FIGURE 9. The shuttle 110 is movable within an X shaped slotted portion 124 of a stationary frame 126, which is made preferably of soft iron for easy passage of magnetic flux. The frame 126 houses eight permanent magnets 128 that are positioned to interact with the coil 116, which receives current from a current source not shown for actuating the coil and shuttle in a well known manner. The shuttle 110 is movable within a defined distance, such as 40mm for example, at the central portion of the frame 126. The dashed line represents the centre line that bisects the slotted portion 124 of the frame at right angles to the direction of travel of the shuttle along the slot 124. The longitudinal slot 124 ends at a point in the frame so as to act as a stop, which effectively defines the limit of travel of the shuttle 110 in one direction.A stop plate 130 is fastened to the end of the frame to prevent the escape of the shuttle from the frame. The magnets 128 are so arranged that the polarities of the magnetic flux encompassing the coil 116 will properly interact with the flow of current in the coil, i.e., the current throughout the coil will flow totally clockwise or counterclockwise at any given instant. Current signals to the coil are passed through coil leads 132 that are connected to a flexible wire cable 140, one end of which is fastened to the shuttle 110 and the other end of which is fastened to an inner wall 142 of the frame 126, by epoxy for example The coil leads are bonded to an edge of the vertical ceramic part 114. The wire cable 140 also provides leads to conduct current to and from the coils of the magnetic heads. With reference to FIGURE 9, a disk file configuration employing the head slider and actuator assembly of FIGURE 8 includes a spindle 134 on which a plurality of magnetic disks 36 are mounted for rotation. Between each pair of disks, frame structures 126 are positioned, each frame supporting permanent magnets 128. Suspensions 118 and 120 and sliders 122 are movable relative to the fixed frames and rotary disks for accessing data tracks on the disk surfaces, in a well known manner. The frame structures are fastened to a baseplate 138 to which the disk drive assembly is mounted. As illustrated in FIGURE 8, the ceramic parts 112 and 114 are formed with shallow recesses 144. These recesses plus the flat areas surrounding them, provide an air bearing effect With reference to FIGURES 10 and 11, air is supplied through air passages 146 to parts 112 and 114. At the end of each air passage adjacent to the parts 112 and 114 is a restrictor aperture 147 that controls the flow of air into the recesses 144. This ensures that air will be supplied to the recesses 144 for all positions of the shuttle 110. The weight of the shuttle actuator assembly 110 is relatively small that it can be supported on frictionless air bearings 148. The air bearings 148 are of the externally pressurised type that require a low pressure which is supplied by a blower not shown , which may be directly attached to the spindle 134. The X shaped shuttle 110 floats on the air bearings and does not touch the frame during its accessing movement. In a preferred implementation, each head slider is connected to separate lead wires fixed to each of the four edges of the vertical part 114, and each lead wire set is separately connected to its own flexible wire cable 140 disposed on respective walls 142 of the frame 126.
