# Valve assembly for a fluid containing tank, especially of a railway car.

## Abstract
A valve assembly for a fluid containing tank and method of making same are provided wherein such valve assembly 21 is mounted on a saddle fixed to a bottom portion of the tank and such valve assembly comprises a housing structure 30 having a fluid inlet 31 and a fluid outlet 32 defined therein, means for mounting the housing structure against the saddle and within the confines of the tank, and a bottom operable valve member 35 carried by the housing structure and adapted to shut off fluid flow between the inlet 31 and outlet 32 , and wherein the inlet and outlet are defined in the housing structure 30 on a common rectilinear flow axis 36 and the valve member has an opening 37 therethrough which is adapted to be aligned between the inlet 31 and outlet 32 to define the open position of the valve assembly 21 . The valve member 35 once moved to the open position enables substantially free unobstructed flow a fluid through the valve assembly 21 parallel to the axis 36 and with minimum pressure drop to thereby enable a maximum rate of fluid transfer through the valve assembly 21 .
