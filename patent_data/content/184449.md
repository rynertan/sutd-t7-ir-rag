# Aerosol water based paint.

## Abstract
This application discloses dimethyl ether propelled water based aerosol compositions. Classes of aqueous thickeners are described herein which are suitable for use in aqueous aerosol coating compositions. The thickeners lose their thickening capability in the presence of dimethyl ether which is the aerosol propellant employed, and thus allows a low enough temporary viscosity to afford suitable flow and breakup when dispensed in spray form from an aerosol dispenser. On evaporation of the dimethyl ether during the spraying process, enough of the dimethyl ether is lost to allow the thickener to regain its thickening capability. High gloss, thick film, aerosol paints can thus be achieved.
