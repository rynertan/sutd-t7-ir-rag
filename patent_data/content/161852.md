## Description
The present invention relates to peptides having influence on the function of the pituitary gland in humans and other animals. In particular, the present invention is directed to a peptide which promotes the release of growth hormone by the pituitary gland. Physiologists have long recognized that the hypothalamus controls the secretory functions of the adenohypophysis with the hypothalamus producing special substances which stimulate or inhibit the secretion of each pituitary hormone. A hypothalamic inhibitory factor was characterized in 1972 in the form of somatostatin which inhibits the secretion of growth hormone GH . In 1982, human pancreatic tumor releasing factors hpGRF were isolated from extracts of human pancreatic tumors, purified, characterized, synthesized and tested, which were found to promote the release of GH by the pituitary. Both of these hypophysiotropic factors have been reproduced by total synthesis, and analogs of the native structures have been synthesized. Synthetic hpGRF peptide analogs have been described in EP A 0 117 034 and in EP A 0 105 759 It is believed that human hypothalamic GH releasing factor has precisely the same structure thus the term hGRF is used hereinafter. A corresponding rat hypothalamic GH releasing factor rGRF , a corresponding porcine hypothalamic GH releasing factor pGRF and a corresponding bovine hypothalamic GH releasing factor bGRF have also been characterized and synthesized. Synthetic polypeptides have now been synthesized and tested which release GH from cultured pituitary cells and which may at least partially resist enzymatic degradation in the body and exhibit very substantially increased potency. These peptides have N Pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the invention include such analogs which are between about 27 and 44 residues in length, or a nontoxic salt of any of these, dispersed in a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable liquid or solid carrier. Such pharmaceutical compositions can be used in clinical medicine, both human and veterinary, for administration for therapeutic purposes, and also diagnostically. Moreover, they can be used to promote the growth of warm blooded animals, including fowl, and in aquiculture for cold blooded animals, e.g. fish, eels, etc. The nomenclature used to define the peptides is that specified by Schroder Lubke, The Peptides , Academic Press 1965 , wherein in accordance with conventional representation the amino group at the N terminus appears to the left and the carboxyl group at the C terminus to the right. By natural amino acid is meant one of common, naturally occurring amino acids found in proteins comprising Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Ser, Thr, Lys, Arg, Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln, Cys, Met, Phe, Tyr, Pro, Trp and His. By Nle is meant norleucine, and by Nva is meant norvaline. Where the amino acid residue has isomeric forms, it is the L form of the amino acid that is represented unless otherwise expressly indicated. D NMA signified the D isomer of alanine wherein the alpha amino group is subtituted by methyl. The invention provides synthetic peptides having the following sequence I wherein R₁ is Tyr, D Tyr, Met, Phe, D Phe, pCl Phe, Leu, His or D His having either a C As defined above, fragments which extend from the N terminal through residue 27 have biological potency in effecting the release of GH by the pituitary, and such biologically active fragments are considered as falling within the scope of the overall invention. When the peptide fragment extends only to residue 27 or 28, Y should be CONH₂ or a substituted amide. When the fragment extends to one of residues 29 thru 39, Y is preferably on amide or a substituted amide but may be COOH. When the fragment has 40 or more residues, there is no clear preference for the moiety at the C terminus. The peptides are synthesized by a suitable method, such as by exclusively solid phase techniques, by partial solid phase techniques, by fragment condensation or by classical solution couplings. The employment of recently developed recombinant DNA techniques may be used to prepare a portion of an analog containing only natural amino acid residues, which could then be linked to a short N terminal peptide. For example, techniques of exclusively solid phase synthesis are set forth in the textbook Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis , Stewart Young, Freeman Co., San Francisco, 1969, and are exemplified by the disclosure of U.S. Patent No. 4,105,603, issued August 8, 1978 to Vale et al. Classical solution synthesis is described in detail in the treatise Methoden der Organischen Chemie Houben Weyl Synthese von Peptiden , E. Wunsch editor 1974 Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, W. Ger. The fragment condensation method of synthesis is exemplified in U.S. Patent No. 3,972,859 August 3, 1976 . Other available syntheses are exemplified by U.S. Patent No. 3,842,067 October 15, 1974 and U.S. Patent No. 3,862,925 January 28, 1975 . Common to such syntheses is the protection of the labile side chain groups of the various amino acid moieties with suitable protecting groups which will prevent a chemical reaction from occurring at that site until the group is ultimately removed. Usually also common is the protection of an alpha amino group on an amino acid or a fragment while that entity reacts at the carboxyl group, followed by the selective removal of the alpha amino protecting group to allow subsequent reaction to take place at that location. Accordingly, it is common that, as a step in the synthesis, an intermediate compound is produced which includes each of the amino acid residues located in its desired sequence in the peptide chain with side chain protecting groups linked to the appropriate residues. Also considered to be within the scope of the present invention are intermediates of the formula II wherein X¹ is either hydrogen or an α amino protecting group. The α amino protecting groups contemplated by X¹ are those well known to be useful in the art of step wise synthesis of polypeptides. Among the classes of α amino protecting groups which may be employed as X¹ are 1 aromatic urethan type protecting groups, such as fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl FMOC , benzyloxycarbonyl Z and substituted Z, such as p chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl, p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, and p methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl 2 aliphatic urethan protecting groups, such as t butyloxycarbonyl BOC , diisopropylmethyloxycarbonyl, isopropyloxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl and 3 cycloalkyl urethan type protecting groups, such as cyclopentyloxycarbonyl, adamantyloxycarbonyl,and cyclohexyloxycarbonyl. The preferred α amino protecting group is BOC, even when an N X is hydrogen or a protecting group for the imidazole nitrogen of His, such as Tos. X² may be a suitable protecting group for the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr, such as tetrahydropyranyl, tert butyl, trityl, Bzl, CBZ, 4Br CBZ and 2,6 dichlorobenzyl DCB . The preferred protecting group is 2,6 dichlorobenzyl. X² can be hydrogen which means that there is no side chain protecting group on the amino acid residue in that position. X³ is hydrogen or a suitable ester forming protecting group for the carboxyl group of Asp or Glu, such as benzyl OBzl , 2,6 dichlorobenzyl, methyl and ethyl. X⁴ may be a suitable protecting group for the hydroxyl group of Thr or Ser, such as acetyl, benzoyl, tert butyl, trityl, tetrahydropyranyl, Bzl, 2,6 dichlorobenzyl and CBZ. The preferred protecting group is Bzl. X⁴ can be hydrogen, which means there is no protecting group on the hydroxyl group. X⁵ is hydrogen or a suitable protecting group for the side chain amido group of Asn or Gln. It is preferably xanthyl Xan . X⁶ is a suitable protecting group for the guanidino group of Arg, such as nitro, Tos, CBZ, adamantyloxycarbonyl, and BOC, or is hydrogen. X⁷ is hydrogen or a suitable protecting group for the side chain amino group of Lys. Illustrative of suitable side chain amino protecting groups are 2 chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl 2 Cl Z , Tos, t amyloxycarbonyl and BOC. X⁸ is hydrogen or a suitable side chain protecting group as generally specified above. Met can optionally be protected by oxygen, but is preferably left unprotected. The selection of a side chain amino protecting group is not critical except that generally one is chosen which is not removed during deprotection of the α amino groups during the synthesis. However, for some amino acids, e.g. His, protection is not generally necessary after coupling is completed, and the protecting groups may be the same. X⁹ is a suitable protecting group for the C terminal carboxyl group, such as the ester forming group X³, or is an anchoring bond used in solid phase synthesis for linking to a solid resin support, or is des X⁹, in which case the residue at the C terminal has a carboxyl moiety which is Y, as defined hereinbefore. When a solid resin support is used, it may be any of those known in the art, such as one having the formulae O CH₂ resin support, NH benzhydrylamine BHA resin support or NH paramethylbenzhydrylamine MBHA resin support. When the unsubstituted amide is desired, use of BHA or MBHA resin is preferred, because cleavage directly gives the amide. In case the N methyl amide is desired, it can be generated from an N methyl BHA resin. Should other substituted amides be desired or should groups other than the free acid be desired at the C terminus, it may be preferable to sythesize the peptide using classical methods as set forth in the Houben Weyl text. In the formula for the intermediate, at least one of the X groups is a protecting group or X⁹ includes resin support. Thus, the invention also provides a method for manufacturing a peptide of interest by a forming a peptide having at least one protective group and the formula II wherein X, X¹, X², X³, X⁴, X⁵, X⁶, X⁷ and X⁸ are each either hydrogen or a protective group and X⁹ is either a protective group or an anchoring bond to resin support or is des X⁹, in which case the residue at the C terminal has a carboxy moiety which is Y b splitting off the protective group or groups or anchoring bond from the peptide of the formula II and c if desired, converting the resulting peptide of the sequence I into a nontoxic salt thereof. In selecting a particular side chain protecting group to be used in the synthesis of the peptides, the following general rules are followed a the protecting group preferably retains its protecting properties and is not be split off under coupling conditions, b the protecting group should be stable to the reagent and, with the exception of Xan, is preferably stable under the reaction conditions selected for removing the α amino protecting group at each step of the synthesis, and c the side chain protecting group must be removable, upon the completion of the synthesis containing the desired amino acid sequence, under reaction conditions that will not undesirably alter the peptide chain. When peptides are not prepared using recombinant DNA technology, they are preferably prepared using solid phase synthesis, such as that generally described by Merrifield, The C terminal amino acid, e.g. Asn, protected by BOC and by Xan, can be first coupled to the chloromethylated resin according to the procedure set forth in After removal of the α amino protecting group, the remaining α amino and side chain protected amino acids are coupled step wise in the desired order to obtain the intermediate compound defined hereinbefore, or as an alternative to adding each amino acid separately in the synthesis, some of them may be coupled to one another prior to addition to the solid phase reactor. The selection of an appropriate coupling reagent is within the skill of the art. Particularly suitable as a coupling reagent is N,N dicyclohexyl carbodiimide DCCI . The activating reagents used in the solid phase synthesis of the peptides are well known in the peptide art. Examples of suitable activating reagents are carbodiimides, such as N,N diisopropylcarbodiimide and N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide. Other activating reagents and their use in peptide coupling are described by Schroder Lubke supra, in Chapter III and by Kapoor, Each protected amino acid or amino acid sequence is introduced into the solid phase reactor in about a fourfold or more excess, and the coupling may be carried out in a medium of dimethylformamide DMF CH₂Cl₂ 1 1 or in DMF or CH₂Cl₂ alone. In cases where incomplete coupling occurs, the coupling procedure is repeated before removal of the α amino protecting group prior to the coupling of the next amino acid. The success of the coupling reaction at each stage of the synthesis, if performed manually, is preferably monitored by the ninhydrin reaction, as described by E. Kaiser et al., After the desired amino acid sequence has been completed, the intermediate peptide can be removed from the resin support by treatment with a reagent, such as liquid hydrogen fluoride, which not only cleaves the peptide from the resin but also cleaves all remaining side chain protecting groups X, X², X³, X⁴, X⁵, X⁶, X⁷ and X⁸ and the anchoring bond X⁹ and also the α amino protecting group X¹ if one is used, to obtain the peptide in the form of the free acid. If Met is present in the sequence, the BOC protecting group is preferably first removed using trifluoroacetic acid TFA ethanedithiol prior to cleaving the peptide from the resin with HF to eliminate potential S alkylation. When using hydrogen fluoride for cleaving, anisole and methylethyl sulfide are included as scavengers in the reaction vessel. The following Example sets forth a preferred method for synthesizing peptides by the solid phase technique. It will of course be appreciated that the synthesis of a correspondingly shorter peptide fragment is effected in the same manner by merely eliminating the requisite number of amino acids at either end of the chain however, it is presently felt that biologically active fragments should contain the indicated sequence at the N terminus. The synthesis of the peptide N After deblocking and neutralization, the peptide chain is built step by step on the resin. Deblocking, neutralization and addition of each amino acid is performed in general accordance with the procedure set forth in detail in Rivier, J, Deblocking is preferably carried out in accordance with Schedule A which follows The couplings are preferably carried out as set out in Schedule B which follows Briefly, one to two mmol. of BOC protected amino acid in methylene chloride is used per gram of resin, plus one equivalent of 1.0 molar DCCI in methylene chloride for two hours. When BOC Arg TOS is being coupled, a mixture of 50 DMF and methylene chloride is used. Bzl ether is used as the hydroxyl side chain protecting group for Ser and Thr. The amido group of Asn or Gln is protected by Xan when DCC coupling is used as is preferred. P nitrophenyl ester ONp may also be used to activate the carboxyl end of Asn or Gln, and for example, BOC Asn ONp can be coupled overnight using one equivalent of HOBt in a 50 mixture of DMF and methylene chloride, in which case no DCC is added. 2 chloro benzyloxycarbonyl 2Cl Z is used as the protecting group for the Lys side chain. Tos is used to protect the guanidino group of Arg and the imidazole nitrogen of His, and the Glu or Asp side chain carboxyl group is protected with OBzl. The phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr is protected with 2,6 dichlorobenzyl DCB . At the end of the synthesis, the following composition is obtained In order to cleave and deprotect the protected peptide resin, it is treated with 1.5 ml. anisole, 0.5 ml. methylethylsulfide and 15 ml. hydrogen fluoride HF per gram of peptide resin, at 20 C. for one half hour and at 0. C. for one half hour. After elimination of the HF under high vacuum, the resin peptide remainder is washed alternately with dry diethyl ether and chloroform, and the peptide is then extracted with degassed 2N aqueous acetic acid and separated from the resin by filtration. The cleaved and deprotected peptide is then dissolved in 0 5 acetic acid and subjected to purification which may include Sephadex G 50 fine gel filtration. The peptide is then further purified by preparative or semi preparative HPLC as described in Rivier et al., The synthesis is repeated using an MBHA resin to produce the same peptide having an amidated C terminus using an initial procedure as generally described in Vale et al.

The synthetic peptides prepared in the Examples are compared with synthetic hpGRF 1 40 OH in To determine the relative effectiveness of certain representative synthetic peptides to promote the release of growth hormone, The results of this comparative testing for equimolar concentrations are shown in Table I. In addition to the Such synthetic hGRF analogs and possibly rGRF, bGRF and pGRF analogs should be useful for human applications in which a physician wishes to elevate GH production. Stimulation of GH secretion by such analogs is of interest in patients with complete or relative GH deficiency caused by underproduction of endogenous GRF. Furthermore, it is probable that increased GH secretion and its attendant increase in growth could be obtained in humans or animals with normal GH levels. Moreover, administration should alter body fat content and modify other GH dependent metabolic, immunologic and developmental processes. For example, these analogs may be useful as a means of stimulating anabolic processes in human beings under circumstances such as following the incurring of burns. As another example, these analogs may be administered to commercial warm blooded animals, such as chickens, turkeys, pigs, goats, cattle and sheep, and may be used in aquiculture for raising fish and other cold blooded marine animals, e.g. sea turtles and eels, and amphibians, to accelerate growth and increase the ratio of protein to fat gained by feeding effective amounts of the peptides. For administration to humans, these synthetic peptides should have a purity of at least about 93 and preferably at least 98 . Purity, for purposes of this application, refers to the intended peptide constituting the stated weight of all peptides and peptide fragments present. For the administration of such synthetic peptides to commercial and other animals in order to promote growth and reduce fat content, a purity as low as about 5 , or even as low as 0.01 , may be acceptable. These synthetic peptides or the nontoxic salts thereof, combined with a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier to form a pharmaceutical composition, may be administered to animals, including humans, either intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, percutaneously, e.g. intranasally or even orally. The administration may be employed by a physician to stimulate the release of GH where the host being treated requires such therapeutic treatment. The required dosage will vary with the particular condition being treated, with the severity of the condition and with the duration of desired treatment. Such peptides are often administered in the form of nontoxic salts, such as acid addition salts or metal complexes, e.g., with zinc, iron or the like which are considered as salts for purposes of this application . Illustrative of such acid addition salts are hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, phosphate, maleate, acetate, citrate, benzoate, succinate, malate, ascorbate, tartrate and the like. If the active ingredient is to be orally administered in tablet form, the tablet may contain a binder, such as tragacanth, corn starch or gelatin a disintegrating agent, such as alginic acid and a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate. If administration in liquid form is desired, sweetening and or flavoring may be used, and intravenous administration in isotonic saline, phosphate buffer solutions or the like may be effected. The peptides should be administered to humans under the guidance of a physician, and pharmaceutical compositions will usually contain the peptide in conjunction with a conventional, solid or liquid, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Usually, the parenteral dosage will be from about 0.01 to about 1 microgram of the peptide per kilogram of the body weight of the host. Although the invention has been described with regard to its preferred embodiments, which constitute the best mode presently known to the inventors, it should be understood that various changes and modifications as would be obvious to one having the ordinary skill in this art may be made without departing from the scope of the invention which is set forth in the claims appended hereto. For example, modifications in the peptide chain, particularly deletions beginning at the carboxyl terminal of the peptide and extending to about position 27, can be made in accordance with the known experimental practises to date to create peptides or peptide fragments that retain all or very substantial portions of the biological potency of the peptide, and such peptides are considered as being within the scope of the invention. Moreover, additions may be made to either terminal, or to both terminals, and or generally equivalent residues can be substituted for naturally occurring residues, as is well known in the overall art of peptide chemistry, to produce other analogs having at least a substantial portion of the potency of the claimed polypeptide without deviating from the scope of the invention. Moreover, modifications may be made to the preferred NH₂ group at the C terminal in accordance with the state of this art today, for example, the carboxyl moiety of the amino acid residue at the C terminus can be the radical COOR, CRO, CONHNHR, CON R R or CH₂OR, with R and R being lower alkyl, fluoro lower alkyl or hydrogen, without deviating from the invention for such modifications result in equivalent synthetic peptides.
