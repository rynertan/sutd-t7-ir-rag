# SILICONE CONTAINING HARD CONTACT LENS MATERIALS HAVING INCREASED OXYGEN PERMEABILITY

## Abstract
This invention relates to an improved hard contact lens polymeric material comprising a siloxane based ester mo nomer, solely, or in combination with methacrylic acid derived cross linking agents, alkanol esters, and or hydro philic monomers. Hard contact lenses made from these polymeric materials have an increased oxygen permeability and surface wettability and thus have potential use in extended wear lens applications.
