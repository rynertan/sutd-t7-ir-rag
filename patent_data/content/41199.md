## Abstract
A hydraulic control system comprising a hydraulic actuator 20, 92 having opposed openings A, B adapted to alternately function as inlets and outlets for moving the ele ment 21 of the actuator 20,92 in opposite directions, a pump 22 for supplying fluid to said actuator 20 92 , pilot operated meter in valve means 27 91 to which the fluid from the pump is supplied for controlling the direction of move ment of the actuator 20 , pilot operated meter out valve means 34, 35 91 associated with each opening A, B of the actuator 20, 92 for controlling the flow out of said actuator 20 , and means 85, 87, 89 86, 88, 90 95, 97 96, 98 for sensing a predetermined drop in a line 33 32 93 94 supply ing fluid to one opening B A of the actuator 20 92 caused by a runaway load in one direction and operating the meter out valve means 34 35 91 to interrupt flow out of the other opening A B of the actuator 20, 92 .
