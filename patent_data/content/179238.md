# SOFT SERVE FREEZER CONTROL

## Abstract
A soft serve freezer operates in a first mode, with both the auger and compressor operating, and a second energy saving mode in which only the refrigeration compressor operates. The control circuit monitors the power level to the auger to control the consistency of the mix. When the mix achieves a selected consistency, the auger discontinues its mixing function. Signal lights are provided to indicate when it is necessary to actuate the auger to obtain the desired consistency prior to dispensing the product and indicate that the mix has achieved the desired consistency.
