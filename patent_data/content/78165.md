# A semiconductor device having a control wiring layer.

## Abstract
A heating wiring layer 122 is formed on a substrate 120 . An insulation layer 124 is formed on the heating wiring layer 122 so as to cover with the heating wiring layer. A control wiring layer 126 , which acts as a fuse device, is formed on the insulation layer 124 transverse to the heating wiring layer 122 . A programming current is directed through the heating wiring layer 122 under the control wire layer 126 which is to be programmed. The heat generated by the programming current is transmitted through the insulation layer 124 to the portion 134 or the control wiring layer which crosses the heating wiring layer 122 . As a result, the control wiring layer 126 is melted by the heat and thus interrupted. Alternatively, the heat may form a eutectic mixture with the materials of two contiguous wiring layers together forming the control layer, to complete the continuity of the control layer.
