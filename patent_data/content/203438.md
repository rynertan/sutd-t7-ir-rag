## Description
This invention relates to novel electrically conductive forms of poly substituted heterocycles , especially poly substituted thiophenes , and to solutions comprising such polymers either in the conductive form or non conductive form. Another aspect of this invention relates to a method of using the solution of this invention to form conducting polymer articles, including films, fibers, and coatings and methods of using such solutions as conducting liquids. There has recently been an increased interest in the electrical conductivity of polymeric systems. For example, U.S. Patents Nos. 4,321,114 and 4,442,187 are directed to conjugated polymers having conjugation in all or a part of at least one backbone chain thereof, such as polyacetylene, polyphenylene, and poly phenylene sulfide . It has recently been discovered that these conjugated backbone polymers can be chemically doped in a controlled manner with electron acceptor and or electron donor dopants to produce electrically conducting polymers. Doping procedures and certain representative doped polymers are described in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,222,903 and 4,204,216. In the general field of conducting polymers, it is believed very difficult to dope one of these conjugated backbone polymers to the extent that it becomes a good conductor 10 ³ 100 ohm ¹cm ¹ and thereafter dissolve the polymer in any solvent system. U.S Patent 4,452,727 discloses novel polymer solutions containing a doped sulfur containing or oxygen containing aromatic polymer. The solvent of this solution is restricted to Lewis Acid halides having a liquid phase under atmospheric pressure for at least one temperature between 150 C and 100 C, such as arsenic trifluoride, phosphorus trifluoride, phosphorous pentafluoride, phosphorus trichloride, boron trifluoride and the like. These solutions can be used to form articles, as for example, by casting the solution onto a substrate, and removing the solvent. This solution and method represents a significant advancement over the art however, it does suffer from certain economic and practical disadvantages resulting from the cost and high environmental reactivity and toxicity of the specific solvents which must be used and the environmental instability of the doped, cast conductive forms. A few conductive species of polyalkylthiophenes are known, having been primarily prepared by electrochemical polymerization. Illustrative of such species are poly 3 methylthiophene and poly 3,4 dimethylthio phene . R. J. Waltman, J. Bargon, and A. F. Diaz, The unsubstituted polythiophenes form highly conductive complexes on doping which are not stable in normal environments containing air or water vapor . However, electrochemically prepared conductive poly 3 methylthiophene is environmentally stable. G. Tourillon and F. Garnier, Thus, there is a need for economically attractive techniques to facilitate the production of conductive and semi conducting forms of environmentally stable poly substituted heterocycles , such as poly substituted thiophenes , on an industrially important scale, to facilitate the doping process, and especially, to develop processing techniques to form shaped articles such as films, fibers and coatings of semi conducting and conducting species of poly substituted heterocycles . It has been discovered that certain species of poly substituted heterocycles of film forming molecular weight can be dissolved in various common organic solvents, and can be doped by various electron dopants to form an electron conductive solution useful for casting conductive films coatings and other conductive polymer articles. More particularly, one of the embodiments of this invention relates to an electrically conductive solution comprising an organic solvent and a doped homopolymer or copolymer of film forming molecular weight, said polymer of the formulae Another aspect of this invention relates to a solution which comprises a an organic solvent and b a homopolymer or copolymer of film forming molecular weight, said polymer of the formulae The use of the solutions of this invention in the methods of this invention provides conductive articles of all shapes, as for example, films and fibers which are air stable, free standing and flexible.

Preferred for use in the practice of this invention are homopolymers and copolymers of the above formula in which m, n and o are as described above R₁ is alkyl having from 2 to about 12 carbon atoms, such as ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, sec butyl, isobutyl, n pentyl, isopentyl, sec pentyl, tert pentyl, n hexyl, n octyl, n nonyl, n decyl, and n dodecyl phenyl alkylphenyl such as 2,4 dimethylphenyl, 4 methylphenyl, 4 ethylphenyl, and 4 butylphenyl phenylalkyl such as benzyl, phenethyl alkoxy having from 1 to about 12 carbon atoms such as methoxy, ethoxy, and propoxy alkanoyl having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms such as formyl, acetyl, and propinyl alkylthio having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms such as methylthio, ethylthio, propylthio, dodecylthio and butylthio alkenyl having from 1 to about 12 carbon atoms such as allyl, vinyl and 3 butenyl or phenyl and alkyl substituted with epoxy, sulfonic acid, nitro, cyano, carboxylic acid, or halo substituents such as trifluoromethyl, 3,4 epoxybutyl, cyanomethyl, 2 nitroethyl, 3 chloropropyl, 4 nitrophenyl, CH₂CH₂CH₂SO₃H and CH₂CH₂CH₂CO₂H R₂, R₃ and R₄ are the same or different and are hydrogen, methyl or R₁ or any of R₁ and R₂, or R₃ and R₄ substituents taken together may form an alkylene or alkenylene chain having from 2 to 20 carbons atoms completing a 4, 5 or 6 membered ring system which may include one or more heteroatoms or oxygen or sulfur such as 1,4 butandiyl, 1,2 ethanediyl, CH₂SCH₂ or CH₂OCH₂ and X₁ and X₂ are the same or different and are S, O or NR₅. Particularly preferred for use in the practice of this invention are homopolymers and copolymers of the above referenced formula wherein R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₄ are the same or different, and are hydrogen or alkyl, with the proviso that at least one of the R₁ and R₃ is alkyl having from 3 to about 12 carbon atoms, and X₁ and X₂ are the same or different and are sulfur or oxygen. Amongst these particularly preferred embodiments, most preferred are those embodiments in which copolymers and homopolymers of substituted thiophenes are used, and wherein the R₁ and R₃ subtitutents are the same or different and are alkyl with the proviso that at least one of R₁ and R₃ is alkyl having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms and R₂ and R₄ are hydrogen. Experimentation has demonstrated that an especially useful copolymer for use in this invention is the copolymer of 3 n butyl thiophene and 3 methylthiophene. Useful copolymers and homopolymers can be prepared through use of conventional chemical and electrochemical procedures well known to those of skill in the art. For example, such materials can be prepared chemically by treating the corresponding 2,5 dihalo bromo or iodo monomer with magensium metal and Ni catalyst in tetrahydrofuran or other ether solvents. This procedure is described in greater detail in M. Kobayashi, J. Chen, T. C. Chung, F. Moraes, A. J. Heeger and F. Wudl, The second essential ingredient of the solutions of this invention is an organic solvent. Indeed, one of the surprising aspects of this invention is that poly substituted heterocycles in the doped and or neutral form can be dissolved in common organic solvents and that such solvents as the Lewis acid halides described in US patent 4,452,727 are not required. The type of solvent employed can vary widely, from polar to non polar. In general, solvents which can be used in the practice of this invention will have a dipole moment greater than zero and less than or equal to about 5, and a dielectric constant of less than about 70. Illustrative of useful solvents are sultones, such as propane sultone, butane sultone, pentane sultone and the like alkyl alkane sulfonates such as methyl methane sulfonate, ethyl methane sulfonate, butyl methanesulfonate, propyl ethane sulfonate and the like linear and cyclic ethers such as 1,2 dimethoxy ethane, dimethoxymethane, dioxane, glymes, diglymes, tetrahydrofuran, 2 methyltetrahydrofuran, anisole, diethylether and the like nitriles such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile, benzonitrile and the like hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, pentane, hexane and cyclopentane halocarbons such as carbon tetrachloride, dichloromethane, and 1,2 dichloroethane, aromatic solvents such as benzene, toluene, xylene, nitrobenzene and the like ketones such as 4 methyl 2 pentanone, methylethylketone, acetone, and the like carbonates such as propylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, ethylene carbonate and the like esters such as methyl formate, methyl acetate, Y butyrolactone, ethyl acetate and the like nitroalkanes, such as nitromethane, nitroethane, nitropropane, and the like amides such as dimethyl formamide, dimethyl thioform amide, N,N dimethyl acetamide, N methylpyrrolidinone and the like organophosphorus compounds such as hexamethyl phosphoroamide, diethylphosphate, triethylphosphites, trimethylphosphate and the like and organosulfur compounds such as sulfolane, methyl sulfolane, dimethyl sulfone, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl sulfolane, glycol sulfite, tetraethylsulfamide and the like. Mixtures of such organic solvents can also be used as for example mixtures of sulfolane and acetonitrile. Solvent selected for use in any particular situation will depend primarily on the polarity of various R₁, R₂, R₃ and or R₄ substituents and or the state of the polymer, i.e. doped or undoped. In general, more polar substituents and higher doping levels of the polymer, will require solvents with higher dielectric constants and dipole moments within the above specified range . Conversely, less polar substituents and lower doping levels of the polymer, will require solvents with lower dielectric constants and dipole moments within the above specified ranges . In general, solvents chosen for use with doped polymers and or those having relatively polar substituents will usually have a dipole moment of from about 0.3 to about 5.0, preferably from about 2.5 to about 5.0 and a dielectric constant of from about 2.0 to about 70, preferably from about 20 to about 65. Illustrative of such solvents are linear and cyclic ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, 2 methyltetrahydrofuran, diethylether, diglyme, glyme and the like halocarbons such as chloroform, 1,2 dichloroethane, dichloromethane and the like amides, such as dimethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide, N methyl pyrrolidone and the like substituted aromatics, such as xylene, anisole, toluene and the like nitriles, such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, benzonitrile, butyronitrile, and the like sulfoxides and other sulfur containing solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide and the like nitro substituted alkanes and aromatics such as nitromethane, nitropropane, nitrobenzene and the like and carbonates such as propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate and the like. In general solvents chosen for use with undoped polymers and or those having relatively non polar substituents will have a dipole moment of from about 0 to about 3.0, preferably from about 0 to about 2.0 and a dielectric constant of from about 2.0 to about 35, preferably from about 2.0 to about 20. Illustrative of such solvents are halocarbons such as dichloromethane, and the like aromatic solvents such as toluene, xylene, benzene and the like cyclic and linear ethers such as dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran and the like hydrocarbons such as hexane, pentane, cyclohexane and the like esters such as ethylacetate, methyl formate and the like sulfoxides, such as dimethylsulfoxide and the like cyclic and linear amides, such as dimethylformamide, N methylpyrrolidone, N,N dimethylacetamide and the like and ketones such as acetone and the like. One solution of this invention includes a third essential ingredient which is an electron dopant solute. The purpose of the dopant is to dope the polymer, and render it electrically conductive both in solution, and in the solid article derived from the solution. In general, such a solute is derived from a compound which upon addition to the polymer ionizes the polymer with co committent disproportionation into a neutral and anionic dopant solute species. The dopant for use in the practice of this invention can vary widely and can be such materials which are known in the art for use in doping conjugated backbone polymers to form conductive or semi conductive polymers, as for example those described in detail in US Pat. Nos. 4,442,187 and 4,321,114 which are hereby incorporated by reference. Such useful dopants can be electron donor dopants and electron acceptor dopants. Illustrative of useful electron acceptor dopants are I₂, AsF₅, AlCl₃, NO and NO₂ salts such as NOBF₄, NOPF₆, NOSbF₆, NOAsF₆, NOCH₃SO₃, NO₂BF₄, NO₂PF₆, NO₂AsF₆, NO₂SbF₆, and, NO₂CF₃SO₃ , HClO₄, HNO₃, H₂SO₄, p toluenesulfonic acid TsOH , benzoylperoxide CF₃SO₃H, SO₃, Br₂, FSO₃ ₂, FSO₃H, Fe ClO₄ ₃, FeCl₃, Fe OTs ₃, and Fe CF₃SO₃ ₃ which give rise to doped polymers containing dopant solutes such as I₃ , NO₃ , BF₄ , PF₆ , AsF₆ , SbF₆ , CF₃SO₃ , ClO₄ , OTs, SO₃ , C₆H₅CO₂, Br₃ , CH₃SO₃ , FSO₃ , and FeCl₄ . Other useful electron acceptor dopants include electrolyte salts such as LiClO₄, LiBF₄, LiAsF₆, NaPF₆, Bu₄NClO₄, Bu₄NOTs, Bu₄NCF₃SO₃, LiCF₃SO₃, AgOTs, and the like, which can be dissolved in a suitable solvent and used to doped the homopolymer or copolymer by electrochemical oxidation of the polymer at the anode of an electrochemical cell. Useful electron donor dopants can vary widely and include those described in detail in US Pat. Nos. 4,321,114 and 4,442,187. Illustrative of suitable electron donor dopants are the alkali metal Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs naphthalides and tetra alkyl ammonium salts of benzophenone ketyl. Preferred for use in the practice of this invention are electron acceptor dopants. While we do not wish to be bound by any theory, it is believed that solid articles composed of polymers doped with electron acceptor dopants are more stable to air. Particularly preferred for use in the conduct of this invention are electron acceptor dopants which give rise to doped polymers containing, the following dopant solutes I₃ , CF₃SO₃ , CH₃SO₃ , NO₃ , TsO , FeCl The proportion of polymer and solvent in the solution of this invention containing the neutral copolymer or homopolymer and the organic solvent and the solution containing the doped polymer and solvent are not critical and can vary widely. However, the following guidelines are believed important for achieving solutions particularly useful in the present invention. In general, the amount of solvent as a proportion of the amount of solution is not believed to be critical, since any amount as a liquid will form at least a viscous gel with doped or undoped polymers. These viscious embodiments of the invention are particularly useful for silkscreening conductive circuitry and for applying thick film coatings on substrates. For other applications, it may be preferred, however, to use sufficient liquid solvent to lower the viscosity of the gel or solution to a point where it flows at least sufficiently to conform to a container shape or mold in a reasonably short period of time, e.g., in 30 minutes or less. Preferably, the solvent is present in sufficient amounts to lower the viscosity of the solution to less than about 2,000 centipoise, and more preferably from about 1 to about 1000 centipoise. The amount of dopant employed in the solution of the doped homopolymer or copolymer is also not believed to be critical and can vary widely. In general, the amount of dopant employed is sufficient to provide a doped polymer either in solid form or in solution which is a semi conductor or a conductor. In general, the amount of dopant employed is at least sufficient to provide a doped polymer having an electrical conductivity either in solution or in solid form equal to or greater than about 10 ⁷ ohm ¹ cm ¹. The upper conductivity is not critical, and usually the highest conductivity which can be obtained is provided. In the preferred embodiments of the invention, the amount of dopant employed is at least sufficient to provide a doped polymer having an electrical conductivity equal to or greater than about 10 ⁶ ohm ¹ cm ¹, and in the particularly preferred embodiments, an amount at least sufficient to provide a doped polymer having a conductivity equal to or greater than about 10 ⁴ ohm ¹ cm ¹. Amongst these particularly preferred embodiments, most preferred are those embodiments of the invention in which the amount of dopant is at least sufficient to form a doped polymer having an electrical conductivity equal to or greater than about 10 ² ohm ¹ cm ¹. In addition to the essential copolymer or homopolymer, dopant and solvent, or copolymer or homopolymer and solvent, whichever is applicable, the solutions of this invention can include other optional ingredients which either dissolve or do not dissolve in the solution. The nature of such optional ingredients can vary widely, and include those materials which are known to those of skill in the art for inclusion in polymer articles. In the case of dissolvable components, materials may be present which alter the physical or mechanical properties of either the solution or the articles eventually cast from the solution. Examples of such materials include other conventional polymers such as polyacrylonitrile, polyvinylidine chloride, polyethylene oxide, polystyrene, nylon, celulose acetate butyrate, celulose acetate, polyphenylene oxides and the like. In the case of non soluble fourth components, materials may be present which either fill or form a substrate for the conductive polymer cast from the solution. These fourth components include other conductive polymers, other polymers such as polyacetylene which may become conductive upon doping, graphite, metal conductors, reinforcing fibers and inert fillers such as clays and glass . The method of forming the solutions of this invention is not critical and can vary widely. For example, one preferred method of forming the present solution containing the doped homopolymer or copolymer is to react, simultaneously, the polymer, the dopant and the solvent as a liquid. Thus, for example, by introducing poly 3 ethylthiophene as a solid powder, toluene as a liquid and iodine as a solid into a mixing vessel, a solution of the doped polymer is quickly formed, from which conductive polymer can be cast. The conditions of such mixing are not critical, provided that sufficient iodine is used to dope the desired quantity of polymer and sufficient solvent is employed to reduce the viscosity of the solution to manageable levels. An alternate technique of preparing the solution of this invention containing the doped polymer is to mix first the polymer and the solvent, which can form a homogeneous solution or remain as a two phase system almost indefinitely depending on the solvent chosen and thereafter add the dopant to the solution or two phase system. Thus, for example, if poly 3 n butyl thiophene powder is admixed with acetonitrile solvent, the powder will remain on or suspended in the solvent for extended periods under normal conditions. The addition of a dopant to this suspension, such as iodine, causes the powder to be doped and, almost instantaneously thereafter, causes the doped polymer to go into solution. Similarly, poly 3 n butyl thiophene can be added to toluene or nitropropane forming a solution to which a dopant such as iodine can be added. A second alternate technique for forming the solution of this invention containing the doped homopolymer or copolymer is to form the dopant solute from part of the solvent, either in the presence of the polymer solute or followed by addition of polymer solute. Thus, for example, adding poly 3 n butyl thiophene to a solvent such as CF₃SO₃H produces a solution of the polymer doped with CF₃SO The solution of this invention which contains the neutral polymer can be prepared merely by dissolving the polymer in a solvent in which it is soluble. For example, solutions of poly 3 n butyl thiophene can be conveniently prepared merely by adding the desired amount of the polymer to a solvent, such as toluene or nitropropane, in which the polymer is soluble. Various methods are contemplated for using the solution of the present invention. First, with regard to solutions of both the conductive doped polymer and the neutral polymer, it is contemplated to remove the solvent from the solution to allow the copolymer or homopolymer to solidify. In the case of the solution of the doped polymer, excess dopant precursor, if present may be removed from the solution by some suitable conventional method if desired. The solvent can be removed from the solution through use of any conventional solvent removal method but is removed preferably by evaporation. Alternatively, the solvent and dopant precursor can be removed by extraction with an extractant in which the solvent and dopant precursor are substantially more soluble than the doped polymer. As will be appreciated by those skilled in polymer processing, the ability to form polymer articles by removing a solvent from a solution enables one to prepare articles of a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Thus, for example, by removing volatiles from the present solution spread on a surface, films of any desired thickness can be prepared. By extruding the solution through a die, fibers or films can be made. Similarly, by removing volatiles from the solution in a mold of various shapes, shaped articles conforming in shape to the mold can be prepared. It will be appreciated that some shrinkage might occur between the solution in its last flowable state to the final article, but such shrinkage is conventionally accounted for in molding polymers from solution. It is also contemplated that, once a solution is formed, a partial or substantial removal of solvent will occur prior to placing the solution on a surface or in a mold, with the final venting of solvent occurring on the surface or in the mold. It is contemplated that, if fourth or additional soluble components are introduced into the solution, they will, unless also volatile, be present in the shaped article formed. If the fourth component is a non volatile liquid, then the removal of volatile components may leave a new liquid or plasticized form of doped conducting polymer or undoped neutral polymer. If the additional components are volatile, then foamed or expanded cellular forms of the polymer may be formed. In those embodiments of the invention in which the solution contains a doped polymer, a conductive or semiconductive article is formed upon removal of the solvent. However, in those embodiments of the invention in which the solution contains a neutral polymer, the resulting article must be contacted with a suitable dopant to render the article conductive or semiconductive. For example, a solution of neutral poly 3 n butyl thiophene can be prepared by dissolving the polymer in a solution such as tetrahydrofuran, toluene or nitropropane, Solvent can removed from solution forming an article composed of the neutral polymer. Thereafter, the polymer article is exposed to a suitable electron acceptor dopant as for example iodine or nitrosonium salts dissolved in a solvent in which the neutral and doped polymer are not soluble for a time sufficient to dope the polymer article to the desired extent. The upper conductivity of the polymer is not critical, and usually the highest conductivity which can be obtained is provided. In general, the polymer is doped until it has an electrical conductivity equal to or greater than 10 ⁷ ohm ¹ cm ¹. In the preferred embodiments of the invention, doping is continued until the electrical conductivity of the polymer is equal to or greater than about 10 ⁶ ohm ¹ cm ¹ and, in the particularly preferred embodiments doping is continued until the electrical conductivity is equal to or greater than about 10 ⁴ ohm ¹ cm ¹. In the most preferred embodiments, doping is continued until conductivities equal to or greater than about 10 ² ohm ¹ cm ¹ are obtained. In the event that fourth or additional non soluble components are present or suspended in the solution, the doped polymer will form around, or be filled with, the insoluble material. If, for example, the additional components are glass fibers, the relative amounts of fibers and doped polymer remaining will cause either the polymer to be fiber filled, the fibers to be polymer impregnated, or some intermediate composite of fibers and doped polymer to be formed. In the case of systems wherein the amount of non soluble component greatly exceeds the doped polymer remaining, individual particles or shapes of non soluble components coated or impregnated with doped polymer will be formed. Examples of articles formed from non soluble components and the present polymer solutions include conductive polymer coated housings for sensitive electronic equipment microporcessors , infrared and microwave absorbing shields, flexible electrical conducting connectors, conductive bearings and brushes and semiconducting photoconductor junctions. It is also contemplated to use the present solutions as such as either liquid conductors or liquid semiconductors, much in the manner that liquid mercury is used in various devices. Examples of such devices include gravity switches, fluid level detecting devices or other electrical or electronic switches. Such use is based upon the conductivity of the doped solution, which the case of poly 3 butylthiophene doped with iodine in toluene can represent a relatively high conductivity from about 10 ⁷ to about 10 ² ohm ¹ cm ¹ which appears to be predominantly of an electronic rather than ionic nature. A fourth application for the present polymer solutions is in the doping of other materials, and especially other conjugated backbone polymers which could also be doped by the electron acceptor dopant alone. Such doping may occur as a part of the process of casting the polymer solution onto the second polymer article, but may also be accomplished without, necessarily, casting the conductive polymer from the solution. The following specific examples are present to illustrate the invention and are not to be construed as limitations thereon. A. To a stirred solution of 3 butylthiophene 5.6g in dichloromethane 25ml was added finely powdered iodine 10.16 g in one portion at room temperature. A solution of concentrated nitric acid 3.36 ml in water 3.36 ml was added dropwise at such a rate to maintain a gentle reflux of the dichloro methane. After refluxing for three more hours, the organic layer was separated, washed successively with water 2 50 ml , sodium thiosulfate solution 1 50 ml , and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the dried solution was even evaporated to provide a crude product, which was purified by column chromatography silica with pentane as eluent to give pure 2,5 diiodo 3 butylthiophene 11.8g . B. To a stirred solution of 2,5 diiodo 3 n butyl thiophene 3.92g, 0.01 mole , prepared as in Step A, in dry THF 20 ml at room temperature under nitrogen was added magnesium turnings 0.243 g, 0.01 mole . After the mixture was gently refluxed overnight, dichloro 1,3 bis diphenylphosphino propane nickel II 0.15g was added in one portion as the catalyst for the polymeriza tion. The mixture was refluxed overnight, then filtered to remove a fine precipitate. The filtrate was evapora ted to give a crude product which was then soxhlet extracted with ethanol. The polymer was further purified by passage through a short column silica using CH₂Cl₂ as eluent 0.8 g . C. To a stirred solution of poly 3 n butylthio phene 0.1 g prepared as in Step B in dichloromethane 5 ml was added a solution of excess iodine in dichlor omethane in one portion. A black solid immediately precipitated. After stirring for an additional 5 minutes, the solid was filtered and washed several times with nitromethane, then vacuum dried. The black solid was pressed into a disk shaped pellet 7 mm in diameter using a KBr die. The conductivity was measured using a four in line probe with 1 mm spacings. The two outer probes were connected to a Keithley Model 225 constant current source. The inner two probes were connected to a Keithley Model 616 Electrometer for voltage measurement. The conductivity of the pellet was calculated to be 3.16 ohm ¹cm ¹, by using the formula Using the procedure of Example 1, 3 methylthiophene 9.82 g dissolved in dichloromethane 60 mL was reacted with iodine 25.4 g to provide 19.8 g of 2,5 diiodo 3 methylthiophene, 7 g of which was in turn treated with magnesium turnings 0.486 g in dry tetrahydrofuran followed by refluxing in the presence of dichloro 1,3 bis diphenylphosphino propane nickel II 0.3 g to form a suspension of poly 3 methylthiophene . The iodine doped poly 3 methylthiophene was then prepared by treatment of a stirred suspension of poly 3 methylthiophene 0.3 g in dichloromethane 15 ML with a solution of excess iodine in dichloromethane. The doped polymer was isolated from the suspension and the conductivity was determined to be 2.7 ohm ¹cm ¹. Using the procedure of Example 1, 3 ethylthiophene 4.49 g dissolved in dichloromethane 25 mL was reacted with iodine 10.16 g to provide 10.2 g of 2,5 diiodo 3 ethylthiophene, 3.64 g, which was in turn polymerized into poly 3 ethylthiophene by treatment with magnesium turnings 0.243 g in dry tetrahydrofuran followed by refluxing in the presence of dichloro 1,3 bis diphenylphosphino propane nickel II 0.25 g . The iodine doped poly 3 ethylthiophene was then prepared by treatment of a stirred solution of poly 3 ethylthiophene 0.3 g in dichloromethane 20 ML with a solution of excess iodine in dichloromethane. The doped polymer was isolated from the solution and its conductivity was determined to be 3.5 ohm ¹cm ¹. A number of experiments were conducted to determine the relative solubilities of the iodine doped and conductive forms of poly 3 methylthiophene , poly 3 ethylthiophene and poly 3 butylthiophene . The procedure employed was as follows Into a small flask was placed 1g of the doped polymer followed by the addition of 10 ml of the desired solvent at room temperature. If the doped polymer did not dissove at room temperature, the solvent was warmed to its boiling point and the solubility noted. The results of these experiments are set forth in the following Table I. In Table I, the following abbreviations are used a VS is very soluble b S is soluble c SS is slightly soluble d I is insoluble e Polymer I is poly 3 n butyl thiophene f Polymer II is poly 3 ethylthiophene g Polymer III is poly 3 methylthiophene and h indicates no evaluation. The iodine doped and conductive complexes of poly 3 butylthiophene and poly 3 ethylthiophene were found to be soluble in tetrahydrofuran, toluene, CH₂Cl₂, nitropropane, nitromethane, propylene carbonate, nitrobenzene, xylene, dimethoxyethane, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulfoxide, N methylpyrrolidone and benzonitrile at room temperature from which the conductive form could be recast. The iodine doped poly 3 methylthiophene was found to be insoluble in all solvents at room temperature but dissolved in nitrobenzene and N methylpyrrolidone at elevated temperatures from which on cooling the conductive form was recast. The relative stability of the iodine doped complexes of poly 3 methylthiophene , poly 3 ethylthiophene and poly 3 butylthiophene were determined by subjecting the doped polymers to dynamic vacuum for 24 hours and determining the conductivity of the polymer. The results of these experiments show that the relative stability of the iodine doped complexes follows the order n butyl ethyl methyl. The butyl derivative lost no weight and its conductivity remained unchanged the ethyl derivative lost a moderate amount of weight and dropped by 20 in conductivity and the methyl derivative lost nearly all of its iodine dopant and conductivity 10 ⁴ ohm ¹ cm ¹ . A. To a stirred solution of 3 bromothiophene 3.26 g, 0.02 mole in dry ether 50 ml at 78 C N₂ was added dropwise 1 equivalent of n butyllithium. After stirring at 78 C for 1 hour, sulfur powder 0.64 g, 0.02 mole was added in one portion. After further stirring for 0.5 hour, the mixture was warmed to 0 C and excess methyliodide 2 ml was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 0.5 hour and then quenched with water. The organic layer was washed with water 2 100 ml , dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, evaporated, and distilled under reduced pressure 76 82 C to give pure 3 methylthiothiophene 1.82 g . B. To a stirred solution of 3 methylthio thiophene 5.2 g, 0.04 mole in CCl₄ 100 ml was added dropwise a solution of Br₂ 0.08 mole in CCl₄ 50 ml . The mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight, then washed with aqueous sodium thiosulfate sodium hydroxide solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and condensed to give a crude product. Passage through a short column silica with pentane as eluent gave a pure product 7.2g . C. To a stirred solution of 2,5 dibromo 3 methylthiothiophene 4.32g, 0.015 mole in dry tetrahydrofuran 40ML at room temperature under nitrogen was added magnesium turnings 0.365g, 0.015 mol . After the mixture was gently refluxed over night, dichloro 1,3 bis diphenylphosphino propane nickel II 0.25g was added in one portion as the catalyst for the polymerization. The mixture was refluxed over night, then filtered to remove a fine precipitate. The filtrate was evaporated to give a crude product which was then soxhlet extracted with ethanol. The polymer was further purified by passage through a short column silica using CH₂Cl₂ as eluent 0.9g . D. To a stirred solution of poly 3 methylthio thiophene 0.25g in CH₂Cl₂ 10ml was added excess I₂ as a solution is CH₂Cl₂. A solid precipitated which was isolated by filtration washed with CH₂Cl₂ and vacuum dried. The conductivity of the solid iodine doped poly 3 methylthio thiophene was 0.5 ohm ¹cm ¹ as determined by the method described in Example 1. To a stirred solution of NOSbF₆ 200 mg in CH₃NO₂ 10 ml was added poly 3 methylthiophene 200 mg powder in one portion at 0 C N₂ . The solid polymer turned blue immediately with the release of a brown gas but did not dissolve in the solvent. After stirring at 0 C for 10 minutes, the blue black powder was filtered and washed several times with CH₃NO₂ and CH₂Cl₂ to remove excess dopant. After drying under vacuum, the powder was pressed into a disk shaped pellet 7 mm in diameter using a KBr infrared die. The conductivity of the pressed pellet was 2.3 ohm ¹cm ¹ as measured by the four point probe technique described in Example 1. Poly 3 methythiophene similarily doped with NOPF₆ and NOBF₄ gave doped insoluble polymers with conductivities of 3.5 and 3.8 ohm ¹cm ¹, respectively. Poly 3,4 dimethylthiophen 2,5 diyl was prepared according to the procedure of Example 1 using 2,5 diiodio 3,4 dimethylthiophene. The yellow neutral polymer is insoluble in common organic solvents at room temperature. On doping with NOSbF₆ by the procedure of Example 7, the doped complex displays a conductivity of 0.5 ohm ¹cm ¹ as measured by the technique of Example 1. The doped complex is also insoluble at room temperature in common organic solvents. This example describes the polymerization of 3 alkylthiophene monomers to directly give a solution of the conductive form of the polymer. Treatment of 3 n butylthiophene in dry nitromethane with 2.2 equivalents of NOSbF₆ in dry nitromethane resulted in a gradual change in the solutions color from clear to deep red to deep blue with production of a gaseous by product. Within just a few minutes, the reaction was over and a deep blue solution of doped poly 3 n butyl thiophen 2,5 diyl was obtained from which conductive materials can be cast. This solution was also used to both dope and coat a piece of neutral polyacetylene film. The resulting dip coated film displayed a conductivity of 15 ohm ¹ cm ¹. This film also exhibited improved air stability over polyacetylene films doped with NOSbF₆ but not coated with the poly thiophene . This example describes a procedure for preparing a copolymer of 3 methylthiophene and 3 butylthiophene, and can be used as a general procedure for other copolymers of differing co monomer proportions. To a stirred solution of 2,5 diiodo 3 methylthiophene 3.50 g, 0.01 mole and 2,5 diiodo 3 n butylthiophene 3.92 g, 0.01 mole in dry THF 50 ml was added magnesium turning 0.486 g, 0.02 mole in one portion. After gentle refluxing overnight, dichloro 1,3 bis diphenyl phosphino propane nickel II 0.3 g was added in one portion and the mixture was refluxed again overnight. After evaporating the solvent, the residue was stirred in ethanol for 2 hours then in 2N HCl for 2 hours. The red solid was dried, then soxhlet extracted with hot ethanol to remove catalyst residues 1.75 g . This material can be doped with common dopants such as I₂, NOSbF₆, NOFP₆ and the like to provide a highly conductive, air stable doped copolymer which is soluble in common organic solvents, such as DMF,toluene, etc. A copolymer comprising 3 methylthiophene and 3 n octyl thiophene with a 60 40 ratio, respectively, of monomers was prepared by the method of Example 10. This copolymer was readily soluble in common organic solvents such as hexane, toluene, THF acetone and the like. Doping with NOSbF₆ as a solution in nitromethane provides a solution of the doped polymer which on evaporation gave cast solids with a conductivity of 5 ohm ¹ cm ¹. This example describes the spray coating of a neutral copolymer of 3 butylthiophene and 3 methylthiophene, followed by iodine doping to give a highly conductive coating on the surfaces of paper, glass, metal, and plastic substrates. Solutions of the co polymer of 3 butylthiophene and 3 methylthiophene were prepared by dissolving the copolymer 0.25 g in THF 10 ml . These solutions were viscious enough such that free standing films could be cast. Likewise, these solutions could be used to cast or spray coat very thin coatings onto a variety of substrates glass, metal, paper, plastic, etc. . By carefully controlling the amount of solvent, compositions with enough viscosity could be obtained to successfully silkscreen patterns onto paper, glass, or plastic substrates. These patterns and coatings were subsequently rendered highly conductive 1 4 ohm ¹cm ¹ by doping with iodine or with solutions of nitrosonium salts in CH₂Cl₂. Thus, coatings for EMI shielding applications and conductive traces for low current circuitry can be readily fabricated.
