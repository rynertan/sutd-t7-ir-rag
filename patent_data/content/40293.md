# System to fill the cases in a uniform manner with fruit and vegetables.

## Abstract
The system consists of an entrance conveyor 5 of the cases 2 co ordinated with the rotating platform 1 of the filling station and with the exit conveyor 8 arranged on frames based on the floor of a feeding conveyor 11 equip ped with a belt 13 with a diaphragm angularly movable 25 in order to have the product 12 flow into the circuit C involving the belt itself and the near parallel one 13 , when the feeding has to be interrupted the feeding conveyor 11 is mounted on a frame 14 with an elevated level and in perpen dicular direction compared with that of the entrance and exit conveyors 5,8 in correspondence of the rotating platform 1 above the latter at the end of the feeding belt 1 and in correspondence with it the distributing machine 27 is instal led in a vertically movable and guided manner, equipped with a vertical belt 30 , from which project the rubber blades 29 inclined towards the top in the descending part in order to receive the product 12 from the feeding belt 13 and to transfer it to the distributing belt 41 , inclined towards the front and towards the bottom, followed by a chute 45 in the plan the distributing machine 27 appears to be shifted com pared with the axis A of rotation of the platform 11 and is equipped with an excentric rotating brush 33 in order to have the product, which would tend to form a ring shaped rise like a bun, roll towards said axis.
