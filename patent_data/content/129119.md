# Method for producting L aspartic acid.

## Abstract
A novel microorganism of the genus Escherichia contain ing a hybrid plasmid prepared by integrating a plasmid with a deoxyribonucleic acid carrying the gene for aspartase which is obtained from a microorganism of the genus Escherichia. An industrially advantageous method for producing L aspartic acid comprising contacting a culture of the novel microorganism, microbial cells collected from the culture or a processed material of the microbial cells with fumaric acid and ammonia to produce L aspartic acid and then collecting L aspartic acid thus produced is also disclosed.
