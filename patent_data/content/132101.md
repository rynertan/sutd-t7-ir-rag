## Description
2 HETEROCYCLOALKYLHIOPENEM DERIVATIVES This invention is directed to a family of antibacterial agents incorporating a 2 azetidinone betalactam ring. Chemically, the antibacterial agents of this invention are identified as 6 alphahydroxyethyl 2 substituted 2 penem 3 carboxyiic acid compounds. Although certain 2 substitted 2 penem 3 carboxylic acid compounds have been previously disclosed, there is a continuing need for novel compounds having desirable antibacterial therapeutic properties. The present invention is directed to a compound of the formulaEMI1.1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R is alk X R1 wherein X is imidazolyl, 1,2,3 triazolyl, 1,2,4 triazolyl or tetrazolyl R1 is hydrogen or alkyl having 1 4 carbon atoms, and alk is alkylene having 1 4 carbon atoms, and R2 is hydrogen or a group which forms an ester which is hydrolyzed in vivo. Included within the scope of the present invention is a compound of the formulaEMI2.1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, whereinR and R2 are as defined above for compounds of formula I. Preferred compounds of formula I and II include those wherein X is imidazolyl, and particularly preferred compounds include those wherein R is 2 imidazol l yl ethyl, l methylimidazol 2 yl methyl, imidazol 4 yl methy1, or I imidazol l yl prop 2 yl Further embracod by the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I or II and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier and a method of treating a bacterial infection in a mammal comprising administering an antibacterially effective amount of a compound of formula I or II. The compounds of formulas I and II are useful as antibacterial agents, and are derivatives of the bicyclic nucleus of the formula EMI3.1 Throughout this specification, the nucleus of formulaIII is identified by the name 2 penem, n and ring atoms are numbered as shown. The carbon atom attached to ring carbon 6 is given the number 8. Also, throughout this specification, the abbreviation PNB is used for the p nitrobenzyl group. The relationship between the hydrogen on bridgehead carbon 5 and the remaining hydrogen on carbon 6 in compounds of formula I can either be cis or trans.The present invention embraces both isomers as well as mixtures thereof. The trans isomer is generally preferred in pharmaceutical applications and the cis isomer can be readily converted to the trans isomer. Generally, carbon 5 will have the absolute stereochemistry designated R using the Prelog Ingold R, S sterochemical notation which is employed in this application. Thus, for example, a compound of formula II whereinR2 is hydrogen and R is l imidazol l yl prop2 y1 is named 5R, 6S 6 R l hydroxyethyl 2 l imidazol l yl prop 2 yl thio 3 carboxyl 2 penem. As will be appreciated, various optically active isomers of the new compounds are possible. The present invention embraces such optically active isomers as well as mixtures thereof. The present invention is directed to penems sub stituted in the 2 position by a moiety of the general formula S alk X R1. It will be appreciated that the heterocyclic groups embraced by X can be linked to alk or R1 at any imino or methylidene positions on the five membered heterocyclic ring. R1 and alk preferably each independently have 1 4 carbon atoms and can be either a straight chain or branched. The present invention includes those penems in which the 3 carboxyl group is esterified to form a nontoxic ester group which is hydrolyzed in viva, i.e.in mammalian blood or tissue, to release the corresponding penem 3 carboxylic acid or a salt thereof.Typical examples of such readily hydrolyzable ester forming residues are alkanoyloxymethyl having from 3 8 carbon atoms, l alkanoyloxy ethyl having Crom 4 9 carbon atoms, l methyl l alkanoyloxy√áethyl having from 5 10 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 6 carbon atoms, l alkoxycarbonyloxy ethyl having from 4 7 carbon atoms, l methyl l alkoxycarbonyloxy ethyl having from 5 8 carbon atoms, N zlkoxycarbonyl amtnomefihyl having from 3 9 carbon atoms, 1 N Calkoxycarbonyl amino ethyl having from 4 10 carbon atoms, 3 phthalidyl, 4 crotonolactonyl, gammabutyrolacton 4 yl, carboxyalkylcarbonyloxymethyl having from 4 12 carbon atoms or 5 methyl 2 oxo l,3 dioxolen 4 yl methyl. To prepare compounds of formula I or II wherein R2 is a group which forms an ester which is hydrolyzed in vivo, the acid of formula I or II R2 is hydrogen is reacted with a base to form the corresponding anion.Suitable cations include sodium, potassium, calcium, tetra alkylammonium and the like. The anion can be prepared by lyophilizing an aqueous solution of T or II, for example, an aqueous solution containing tetrahydrofuran, and sodium bicarbonate or tetrabutylammonium hydroxide. The resulting anion of I or II is reacted with the corresponding chloride or bromide of R2 in a reaction inert solvent such as acetone or dimethylformamide at about 20 to about 50 C, preferably 250C. The compounds of formula I or II wherein R1 is hydrogen or a salt thereof can be synthesized according to Schemes A C. As shown in Scheme A, a compound of formula II can be prepared in accordance with the procedure of Yoshida et al, Chem. Pharm. Bull., 29, 2899 2909 1981 , from the known dibromo penam of formula IV. The dibromo penam V undergoes an exchange reaction with t butyl magnesium chloride at a temperature of between about 90 and 40 C, preferably about 760C in a reactioninert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether or toluene, preferably tetrahydrofuran. Other organometallic reagents may also be employed. The resultant reaction mixture is treated in slts with the appropriate aldehyde e,g., acetaldehyde for the l hydroxyethyl derivative. The aldehyde is added at between about 80 and 60 4 C, preferably about 76 C for acetaldehyde. SCHEME AEMI6.1 SCHEME BEMI7.1 SCHEME C EMI8.1 The resulting bromo hydroxy penam V is hydrogenated to remove the 6 bromo substituent. A suitable hydrogenation catalyst is a noble metal catalyst such as palladium. The reaction is carried out in a protic solvent such as 1 1 methanol water or 1 1 tetrahydrofuran water, preferably 1 1 methanol water, at a pressure of about 1 to 4 atms, preferably 4 atm and a temperature of between about 0 and 300C, preferably about 250C, The resulting alcohol of formula VI can be protected with a trialkylhalosilane of the formulaEMI9.1 wherein R9 at each occurrance is an alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms and Q is chloro, bromo or iodo.Thus, dimethyl t butylchlorosilane in the presence of an amine proton acceptor such as imidazole in a polar, aprotic solvent such as N,N dimethylformamide at a temperature range of between about 5 and 400C, preferably about 250C forms a trialkylsilyl hydroxylprotecting group as shown in formula VII. Treatment of VII with mercuric acetate in acetic acid at a temperature of about 90 C yields the olefin VIII. In order to obtain the desired azetidinone IX, the oleo in VIII is ozonized in a reaction inert solvent such as dichloromethane at a temperature of between about 80 and 40, preferably about 760C. The reaction product is treated with an alkanol such as methanol to yield the azetidinone IX. As shown in Scheme B, a compound of formula IX is treated with trithiocarbonate salt of the formula M R10 S C S S wherein R10 is alkyl having 1 4 carbon atoms, preferrably ethyl, and M is a metal such as sodium or potassium to obtain a compound of formula X. This conversion of IX to X is carried out in an organic solvent or water, preferably a mixture of water and dichloromethane at a temperature range of about 0 350C, preferably about 250C. The compound of formula X is condensed with nitrobenzyl chloro oxalate in the presence of a tertiary alkylamine wherein each alkyl has, for example, 1 4 carbon atoms such as ethyl di isopropylamine, to obtain the compound of formula XI. This condensation reaction is carried out in a reaction inert solvent, preferably dichloromethane, at a temperature range of about 5 25 CC, preferably about 100C. The resulting compound of formula XI is cyclized using a trialkyl phosphite wherein alkyl has 1 4 carbon atoms such as triethylphosphite in a reaction inert solvent such as trichloromethane at a temperature range of about 40 800C, preferably about 600C, to obtain the penem of formula XII. The thio group of compound XII is oxidized to the corresponding sulfoxide XIII with an oxidizing agent such as m chloroperbenzoic acid in a reaction inert solvent such as dichloromethane, at a temperature range of about 10 to 30 C, preferably 200C. The surf oxide XIII is substituted with the mercaptide of formula R S by employing, for example, the sodium or potassium salt which is reacted with the sulfoxide XIII in an polar organic solvent such as ethanol or acetonitrile at a temperature range of about 35 to 500C, preferably about 35 C. Starting mercaptans of the formula R SH or starting thioacetates of the formula R S C O CE3 are known or can be prepared by analogous methods known in the art. For a review see J.L. Wardell, Preparation of Thiols, in The Chemistry of the ThiolGroup, S. Patai, editor, John Wiley Sons, London, 1974, Chapter 4. Mercaptans or their derivatives which are required can be prepared from the corresponding alcohols, halides, p toluenesulfonates , methanesulfonates and the like.Suitable thiol derivatives which are readily converted to thiols include thioacetates by saponification and t butylthioethers or p methoxybenzylthioethers by treatment with acid or mercuric salts . See also Volante, Tetrahedron Letters, 22, 31193122 1981 for the conversion of alcohols to thiols and thiolesters using triphenylphosphine and a dialkyl azodicarboxylat in the presence of the alcohol and an appropriate thiolacid. For compounds of formula XIV the trialkylslyl group is preferably removed prior to the hydrogenolysis to remove the acid protecting group PNB to obtain a compound of formula XV. The trialkylsilyl group is removed with a tetraalkylammonium fluoride in an ethereal solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a temperature range of about 15 to 4O0C, preferably about 250C. Conversion of a compound of formula XV to a compound of formula I or II is accomplished using a conventional hydrogenolysis reaction, and it is carried out in conventional fashion for this type of transformation. Thus, a solution of a compound of the formula XV is stirred or shaken under an atmosphere of hydrogen, or hydrogen mixed with. an inert diluent such as nitrogen or argon, in the presence of a catalytic amount of a noble metal hydrogenolysis catalyst, such as a palladium on calcium carbonate or a palladium onCelite a diatomaceous earth catalyst. Convenient solvents for this hydrogenolysis are lower alkanols, such as methanol ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxan low molecular weight esters, such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate water and mixtures of these solvents. However, it is usual to choose conditions under which the starting material is soluble.The hydrogenolysis is usually carried out at room tempera 2 ture and at a pressure from about 0.5 to about 5 kg cm The catalyst is usually present in an amount from about 10 percent by weight based on the starting material up to an amount equal in weight to the starting material, although larger amounts can be used. The reaction commonly takes about one hour, after which the compound of the formula I or II is recovered simply by filtration followed by removal of the solvent in vacuo. If paliadium on calcimm carbonate is used as the catalyst, the product is often isolated as the calcium salt and if palladium on Celite a diatomaceous earth is employed, the product is often isolated as the sodium salt. The compound of formula I or II can be purified by con ventional methods for beta lactam compounds. For example, a compound of formula I or II can be purified by column chromatography gel filtration on Sephadex, or by recrystallization. An alternate synthetic procedure is shown inScheme C. The azetidinone of formula IX is reacted with a tri thiocarbonate of the formula M R S C S S wherein M is a metal such a sodium or potassium, using the procedure previously described to prepare X. The resulting trithiocarbonate XVA is treated with nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl dihydroxy methane in an aprotic solvent such as benzene, toluene or dimethylformamide, preferably benzene, at a temperature range of about 25 1100C, preferably about 8O0C to yield the alcohol of formula XVI. The corresponding chloride XVII is prepared from the alcohol XVI by treatment with thionyl chloride in a reaction inert organic solvent such as dichloromethane in the presence of a hindered amine which serves as an acid acceptor such as 2,6 lutidine at a temperature range of about 10 to 750C, preferably OOC. The chloride XVII is reacted with a triaryiphosphine such as triphenylphosphine in a reaction inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a tertiary amine such as 2,6 lutidine at a temperature cf about 250C, to obtain the compound of formula XVIII which is cyclized by refluxing in an aromatic solvent such as toluene to yield the penem of formula XIV. Trithiocarbonate salts of the formula M R S C S S are prepared from the appropriate mercaptan of the formula R SH or bv treatment of a thioacetate of the formula RSC O CE3 with an alkali metal alkoxide followed by carbon disulfide. By employing the heretofore mentioned procedure ofYoshida et al., the stereochemistry at carbon 6 of the penem as well as the hydroxyethyl group attached to carbon 6 is that shown in formula II. The principal stereochemistry of the product of ring closure using SchemesB or C is that wherein the hydrogen at penem ring position 5 is trans to the hydrogen on carbon 6 and in the alpha configuration. The compounds of formula I or II are acidic and will form salts with basic agents. Such salts are considered to be within the scope of this invention. These salts can be prepared by standard techniques, such as contacting the acidic and basic components, usually in a stoichiometric ratio, in an aqueous, non aqueous or partially aqueous medium, as appropriate. They are then recovered by filtration, by precipitation with a nonsolvent followed by filtration, by evaporation of the solvent, or in the case of aqueous solutions by lyophilization, as appropriate. Basic agents which are suitably employed in salt formation belong to both the organic and inorganic types, and they include ammonia, organic amines, alkali metal hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates, hydrides and alkoxides, as well as alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates, hydrides and alkoxides.Representative examples of such bases are primary amines, such as n propylamine, n butylamine, aniline, cyclohexyl amine, benzylamine and octylamine, secondary amnes, such as diethylamine, morpholine, pyrrolidine and piperidine tertiary amines, such as triethylamine,N ethylpiperidine, N methylmorpholine and 1,5 diazabicyclo 4,3,03non 5 ene hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide and barium hydroxide alkoxides, such as sodium ethoxide and potassium ethoxide hydrides, such as calcium hydride and sodium hydride carbonates, such as potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate bicarbonates, such as sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate and alkali metal salts of long chain fatty acids, such as sodium 2 ethylhexanoate. Preferred salts of the compounds of formula I orII are sodium, potassium and calcium salts. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of formula I or II are those which are free of significant adverse side effects at the levei of ordinary use and include, e.g., the sodium, potassium or calcium salts thereof. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the compounds of the formula I or II and salts thereof can be demonstrated by measuring their minimum inhibitory concentrations MIC s in mcg ml against a variety of microorganisms. The procedure which is followed is the one recommended by the International Collaborative Study onAntibiotic Sensitivity Testing Ericcson and Sherris,Acta. Pathologica et Microbiologia Scandinav, Supp.217, Section B 6468 1971 , and employs brain heart infusion BHI agar and the inocula replicating device.Overnight growth tubes are diluted 100 fold for use as the standard inoculum 20,000 10,000 cells in approxmately 0.002 ml. are placed on the agar surface 20 ml.of BHI agar dish . Twelve 2 fold dilutions of the test compound are employed, with initial concentration of the test drug being 200 mcg ml. Single colonies are disregarded when reading plates after 18 hrs. at 370C.The susceptibility MIC of the test organism is the lowest concentration of compound capable of producing complete inhibition of growth as judged by the naked eye. The compounds of formula I or II, and the pharmaceu tcally acceptable salts thereof, are suitable for the control of bacterial infections by susceptible bacteria in mammals, including man, e.g. infections caused by susceptible strains of Staphvlococcus aureus. The compounds of the present invention can be administered orally or parenterally, i.e. intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally or intravenously, alone, or combined with 2 pharmaceuticallyacceptable carrier. The ratio of active ingredient to carrier will depend on the chemical nature, solubility and stability of the active ingredient, as well as the dosage contemplated. The ratio of the pharmaceuticallyacceptable carrier to the penem compound will normally be in the range from about 1 10 to 4 1. For oral administration, the compounds of this invention can be used in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, powders, syrups, elixirs, aqueous solutions and suspensions, and the like. In the case of tablets, carriers which can be used include lactose, sodium citrate and salts of phosphoric acid. Various disintegrants such as starch, and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc, are commonly used in tablets. Useful diluents for capsules include lactose and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient may be combined with emulsifying and suspending agents.Sweetening and or flavoring agents can be added. For parenteral administration, sterile solutions of the active ingredient are usually prepared, and the pH of the solutions are suitably adjusted and buffered. For intravenous use, the total concentration of solutes should be controlled to render the preparation isotonic. The prescribing physician will determine the appropriate dose for a given human subject, and this can vary according to the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, as well as the nature and the severity of the symptoms. The compounds of formula I or II will normally be used orally at dosages in the range from about 10 to about 200 mg. per kilogram of body weight per day, and parenterally at dosages from about 10 to about 400 mg. per kilogram of body weight per day. In some cases it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits. The following Examples and Preparations are provided solely for further illustration.
