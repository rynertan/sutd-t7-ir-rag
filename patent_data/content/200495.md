## Description
This invention relates to derivatives of pineapple ketone having a flavor similar to that of pineapple ketone and reduced reactivity. Pineapple ketone is the common name for the chemical 2,5dimethyl 4 hydroxy 3 2H furanone, and its derivatives in which the alkyl groups are substituted, such as for instance, 2 ethyl 5 methyl 4 hydroxy 3 2H furanoneJ sometimes called thomo pineapple ketone , or its derivatives in which one of the alkyl groups is substituted by hydrogen, sometimes called a des pineapple ketone . Pineapple ketone is found in pineapples, strawberries, raspberries meats, and other foods. It has been found in cooked, roasted and fermented foods including coffee, roasted filbert, roasted almond and soy sauce. Pineapple ketone is known to be formed by the non enzymatic browning process that occurs during roasting and baking. Because of its cotton candyr caramelized sugar flavor, pineapple ketone is used extensively to compound synthetic flavors. However, it reacts readily with amines, aldehydes and oxygen. Hirvi, et al., Lebensm. Wiss. u. Technol., 13, 324 1980 have indicated how sensitive pineapple ketone is to oxidation . At pH 4, it has a half life of 120 days, while at pH 7 , it has a half life of 12 days. Oxidation in dry consumables during shelf life, for instance, reduces the pineapple ketone content and the effectiveness of the flavor to three months or less. In perfumes, the instablity of pineapple ketone causes changes in the fragrance profile and discoloration. One common use of pineapple ketone is in chewing gum.In this use, however, its water solubility causes it to awash 0.1 quickly in saliva during the chewing process, resulting rapid loss of flavor. One solution to the problem of flavor loss in chewing t , disclosed in European Patent Application 853046746, uses carbonate derived from pineapple ketone. The pineapple ke ne carbonates are formed by reacting pineapple ketone with ethyl chloroformate or other alkyl chloroformates in triethylamine. The chemical reactivity of the resulting com Founds is reduced compared with pineapple ketone, while the or of the derivatives remains very similar to the flavor pineapple ketone, although it is less intense.The re ced chemical reactivity of these derivatives, particularly heir increased resistance to oxidation, allow their use in p jications where the shelf life of pineapple ketone is in equate or it is too reactive, as in dry foods, tobacco, and perfumes. Furthermore, the carbonate derivatives are not as water soluble as pineapple ketone, which allows these derivatives to be preferentially dissolved by a chewing gum base, inhibiting ore transfer to saliva of the pineapple ketone like flavor of the derivatives while in the mouth, and prolonging the taste. However, the pineapple ketone carbonate derivatives do st hydrolize readily to pineapple ketone in saliva and their less intense flavor is a disadvantage. According to the invention, a derivative of pineapple ne stone having a similar flavor but reduced reactivity is a lkoxyalkyl ether having the general formula,EMI2.1 nr in R1 and R2 independently are H, CH3, or CH2CH3 7 is alkyl of from 1 to 10 carbons, alkenyl of from 1 to 10 arsons, or aryl of from 6 to 10 carbons and R4 is hydrogen, alkyl of from 1 to 10 carbons, alkenyl of from 1 to 10 carbons aryl of from 6 to 10 carbons. While the derivative of the invention has the advantages of the pineapple ketone carbonate derivatives, its slow release from the chewing gum base is accompanied by hydrolysis to the parent pineapple ketone in the slightly acid pH of saliva about 6.2 thus producing the normally, intense flavor of the parent compound. In particular, the pineapple ketone l alkoxyalkyl ether according to the invention tastes like pineapple ketone, avoids wwash outt by being preferentially soluble in chewinggum base, and is less chemically reactive than pineapple ketone. It can be used in perfumes, and its resistance to oxidation in dry consumables preserves its flavor for a shelf life of up to 2 years. The increased oxidative stability of the compounds according to the invention as compared to pineapple ketone is shown in Comparative Example 3. Also according to the invention, a process for making a pineapple ketone l alkoxyalkyl ether according to the invention comprises reacting pineapple ketone with ethyl vinyl ether or other l alkoxy l alkenes with an acid catalyst in trace amounts.
