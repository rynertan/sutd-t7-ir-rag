# Liquid jet printing apparatus.

## Abstract
An ink jet array printer 1 in which the voltage waveform 9 applied to the raster 14 of drops formed in each printing gun 2 for printing a line section of any one of successively formed transverse printing lines, comprises at least two successive sets of voltage levels which arrange the raster drops in a group in time order of drop formation for each set of voltage levels so that corresponding drops in each of the groups formed in the raster 14 , if charged for printing, have similar differences of voltage level and have similarly spaced print locations in the line section of drops printed by the printing gun 2 .
