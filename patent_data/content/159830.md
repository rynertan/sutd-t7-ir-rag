# Process of manufacturing element for electrophoresis and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A process of manufacturing an element for electropho resis which comprises steps of sticking a spacer 3, 3 con tinuously to both side portions of a support web 2 which is rolled back continuously from the rolled condition 1 casting on said support 2 a solution 6 of forming a medium mem brane for electrophoresis subjecting the support 2 to harden ing treatment to form a medium membrane 8 cutting off a portion of the medium membrane 8 and support web 2 and sticking a cover sheet 12 onto the medium membrane 8 . An apparatus advantageously employable for performing the above process is disclosed.
