## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING KETANSERINEThis invention relates to a new process for preparing the compound 3 L2 ffi4 p . fluorobenzoyl l piperidinyg ethyg 2,4 1R,3H quinazolinedione, known in the pharmaceutical field by the name ofKetanserine, and used as an anti hypertensive and anticongestive, particularly in its salified form with pharmacologically suitable acids The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics,Vol. 218, No. 1 .The structural formula of the compound is as follows EMI1.1 The known process for preparing the said compound consists of reacting 4 p. fluorobenzoyl piperidine with 3 2 chloroethyl 2 ,4 lH,3R quinazolinedione in the presence of Na2C03, in a solvent.The yield of this process is very low, being of the order of 20Z. Moreover, the presence of extraneous substances in the reaction product, such as sodium carbonate and the solvent, make it necessary to separate and purify the product by industrially costly operations European Patent Application 80300059.5 . The present invention provides a new process for preparing the product I , consisting essentially of reacting together equi molecular quantities of 4 p.fluorobenzoyl piperidine and 2,3 dihydro 5H oxazole 2 ,3 b quinazolin 5 one. The reaction scheme is as followsEMI2.1 The reaction can be carried out by mixing the two reagents in powder form, and heating the mixture until fusion takes place.The temperature is kept at around 100 C for a certain time to enable the reaction to go to completion. The reaction product is in the form of a solid microcrystalline mass, from which the product can be obtained at a high degree of purity by simply dissolving it in a solvent followed by recrystallisation.Alternatively, the reaction can be carried out in an inert solvent such as an aromatic hydrocarbon, preferably in the presence of a small quantity of a strong acid acting as catalyst.Whether the solvent is absent or present, the reaction takes place with a very high yield and oonversion. By products are practically absent, and the crude reaction product contains only a small quantity of unreacted starting substances in addition to the required product I .When the Ketanserine has been separated, the reaction solvent or mother liquors of crystallisation can conveniently be recycled to a further preparation process, as in practice they contain no by products.As stated, when carried out in a solvent the reaction can be catalysed by a small quantity of strong acid, which can be either inorganic such as H2S04 or HC1, or organic such as a sulphonic acid. In practice an acid can be used having a pK not exceeding 2.The two reagents used in synthesising the product according to the present invention are known compounds and can be prepared by methods described in the technical literature. Specifically, the preparation of the compound 2,3 dihydro 5H oxazole 2,3 b quinazolin S one is described by Grout and Partridge in JournalChemical Soc. 1960 page 3551 onwards.The preparation of the compound 4 p.fluorobenzoyl piperidine is described in Journal of Medicinal Chemistry Vol. 13 No. 1 1970 , page 1 onwards.The examples given hereinafter illustrate the operating details of the process according to the invention, but without constituting any limitation thereto.EXAMPLE 1The following are fed into a flask fitted with a reflux condenser 4 p.fluorobenzoyl piperidine 20.7 g 0.1 M 4 p. fluorobenzoyl piperidine.
