# Gas turbine combustor.

## Abstract
A gas turbine combustor having a head combustion chamber 7 and a rear combustion chamber 11 , with a plurality of air supply ports 13 arranged in a circumferential wall of the rear combustion chamber 11 , and a fuel nozzle 9 . An outer cylinder 5 forms a cylindrical air flow passage between the inner cylinder 6 and the outer cylinder 5 . A cylindrical control member 28 is provided which is adapted to be movable in an axial direction for regulating an opening of the air supply ports 13 . The control member 28 during the axial movement of the control member 28 is supported by a supporting means which is adapted to maintain a gap between the control member and the wall of the rear combustion chamber. The supporting member includes a flexible member 32a, 32b for absorbing a deformation of the control member 28 so that it is possible to prevent, if not avoid, mechanical wear on the control member and to reduce the No
