# THERMOFORMING METHODS AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
Thermoforming machines with a heating station and a downstream mold station have carrier clamp frames for gripping the edges of sheets of plastic at a load station and indexing them successively to a heating station and a mold station. The carrier frame members to which the plastic may be releasably clamped carry their own remotely operated clamps and are themselves expandable and contractible to a condition in which, prior to molding, they control the sag in the sheet formed during heating of the sheets to differential pressure forming temperature. The plastic sheet can be molded to only a portion of a product which functions as a mold member.
