## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device according to the preamble of claim 1, and more particularly to a word line driver circuit employing a bipolar transistor and an insulated gate field effect transistor hereinbelow, termed IGFET which is well suited to attain a high driving capability and a large output amplitude. As a circuit employing a bipolar transistor and an IGFET, there has heretofore been a semiconductor device disclosed in the official gazette of JP A 59 25423. Fig. 1A is a circuit diagram of the semiconductor device. The operation of the circuit and the problem thereof will be explained with reference to Fig. 1A. This semiconductor device consists of the parallel connection between a circuit composed of CMOS complementary MOS transistors 4, 5 and a bipolar transistor 7 and a circuit composed of an IGFET 6 and a bipolar transistor 8. In the ensuing explanation, the voltage V Besides the circuit stated above, there has been driving circuitry disclosed in the official gazette of Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 59 8431 as a semiconductor device constructed of a circuit in which IGFETs and bipolar transistors are combined. Fig. 1B is a diagram showing the circuit arrangement of the semiconductor device. The circuit in Fig. 1B is such that circuits composed of symmetrically arranged CMOS inverter circuits and bipolar transistors are connected in parallel across input and output nodes. The foregoing circuit in Fig. 1A delivers a signal having an inversive phase to the phase of an input, whereas the circuit in Fig. 1B delivers a signal having the same phase as that of an input. More specifically, when the input node I becomes a high level, an IGFET 13 turns on and current flows to the base of a bipolar transistor 17, so that this bipolar transistor 17 turns on . Meanwhile, a P channel IGFET 15 turns off and an N channel IGFET 16 turns on , so that the base potential of a bipolar transistor 18 becomes O V to turn off this bipolar transistor 18. As a result, current flows to the output node O, the potential of which rises. At this time, the potential of the output node O rises up to a value V As another example of driving circuitry constructed including a bipolar transistor, a circuit shown in Fig. 1C is disclosed in the official gazette of Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 59 8431. In this circuit, when an input node I becomes a low potential, a base current flows from a power source V Semiconductor circuits using two different power supply voltages for generating a high output signal from a smaller input signal are disclosed in DE A 33 50 567 and EP A 0 090 116. These circuits are pure MOS circuits and therefore not capable of providing a high output current. Mixed MOS and bipolar circuits which use the high current driving capability of a bipolar transistor are disclosed in Radio, Fernsehen, Elektronik, Vol. 33, No. 3, March 1984, pages 165 to 166 and Electronics, October 6, 1981, pages 124 to 126. These circuits have the disadvantage that their output amplitude is lower than their input signal level. To sum up, the following problems are revealed It is the object of the invention to increase the access speed of a semiconductor memory. The above object is solved by the invention characterized in claim 1. The invention is based on the idea that the resistance and capacitance of a word line is a main factor limiting the operating speed of the memory. In common semiconductor memories, to facilitate the production process, the word lines are preferentially made of polysilicon rather than aluminum although polysilicon has a higher resistance. To shorten the access time, the invention uses a word line driver employing a bipolar transistor which is capable of supplying particularly high currents and high voltages. The semiconductor memory defined in dependent claim 4 has the further advantage that the source for the base current of the bipolar transistor is independent from the source of the collector current. This feature allows to control the voltages at the collector and at the base of the bipolar transistor so that the collector potential is always higher than the base potential and a latch up effect is avoided. Further, since the base current is usually as small as 1 h Preferred embodiments of the invention are explained in the following description in connection with the accompanying drawings.

Now, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings. Fig. 2 is a diagram of an embodiment for explaining the concept of the semiconductor device of the present invention. Shown in Fig. 2 is a case of a circuit having one input and one output. In the figure, letter D denotes a combined circuit which includes bipolar transistors and IGFETs or MIS or MOS transistors , while letter C denotes a preceding circuit which controls the circuit D. Letter A indicates a node to which the reference voltage of the operation of the circuit C is applied, and symbols B₁ B In the present invention, at least one of the voltages to be applied to the nodes B₁ B Here, the voltages to be applied to the node A and the nodes B₁ B Fig. 3 is an arrangement diagram of a semiconductor device showing the details of the first embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the reference pulse voltage of the operation of a circuit D is applied to a node B₁, and a level higher than the operating reference voltage V Now, the operation of the device in Fig. 3 will be described with reference to voltage wave forms in Fig. 4. Assuming that an input node E be at O V, the potential of a signal line F takes a high level and becomes steady at the voltage V When the potential of the input node E is shifted to O V and the potential of the node B₁ is brought back to V As thus far described, according to Embodiment 1, the potential of the node B₁ to be applied when the signal received from the signal line F is the low voltage is set at will, whereby the output of the high voltage can be produced while the feature of high operating speed of the bipolar transistor is kept. In Fig. 3, the N channel IGFET 29 for lowering the potential of the output node G can be replaced with an arrangement shown at numeral 30 in Fig. 5. That is, the circuit D comes to have an arrangement in which combinations each consisting of the inverse CMOS transistors and the bipolar transistor are connected in parallel. In this case, current flowing through an N channel IGFET 40 is amplified by a bipolar transistro 42, so that the lowering of the potential of the output node can be effected fast. Herein, however, the potential of the output node G does not lower perfectly to O V because it is limited by the base emitter forward voltage of the bipolar transistor 42. In a case where the potential of the output node G needs to be lowered perfectly to O V, the arrangement 30 in Fig. 5 may be disposed in parallel with the N channel IGFET 29 in Fig. 3. In Fig. 5, a P channel IGFET 41 serves to discharge charges stored in the base of the bipolar transistor 42 when the signal line F was O V and to reliably turn off this bipolar transistor 42. Fig. 6 is an arrangement diagram of a semiconductor device showing a second embodiment of the present invention. The difference between this embodiment and the embodiment in Fig. 3 is that, in Fig. 3, the collector of the bipolar transistor 26 and the source of the P channel IGFET 25 are connected to the node B₁, whereas in Fig. 6, only the source of a P channel IGFET 51 is connected to a node B₁, which is not connected to the collector node B₂ of a bipolar transistor 52. That is, in the arrangement of Fig. 6, only the base current of the bipolar transistor 52 may be fed from the node B₁. Accordingly, as compared with the case of feeding both the base and collector currents of the bipolar transistor 26 from the node B₁ as in Fig. 3, the embodiment lightens the burden of a circuit for driving the node B₁ and therefore becomes capable of a high speed operation. The other operations are the same as in Fig. 3. In Fig. 6, the collector of the bipolar transistor 52 is connected to the node B₂ and can have its potential set independently of the node B₁ for feeding the current to the base 55 of this transistor. By holding the potential of the node B₂ higher than that of the base 55 of the bipolar transistor 52, accordingly, this bipolar transistor 52 can be reliably prevented from getting saturated. To this end, a pulse voltage having an amplitude not smaller than the base voltage of the bipolar transistor 52 may be impressed on the node B₂ in synchronism with the potential fluctuation of the base 55, or the potential of the node B₂ may be held at a fixed value higher than the upper limit of the potential of the base 55. In the latter case, when the signal line F has become the high level to shift the potential of the output node G to the low level, a high voltage acts on the collector emitter path of the bipolar transistor 52. At this time, however, no problem is posed for the reason that the base 55 is grounded by an N channel IGFET 53, so the breakdown voltage of the bipolar transistor 52 is determined by BV Fig. 7 is an arrangement diagram of a semiconductor device showing a third embodiment of the present invention. The great difference in circuitry between Fig. 7 and Fig. 6 is that, in Fig. 6, the circuit D performs the so called inversive operation of delivering a signal having the inversive phase to the phase of a signal received from the signal line F, whereas in Fig. 7, a circuit D performs the so called non inversive operation of delivering a signal having the same phase as that of an input F. In Fig. 7, a bipolar transistor 83 is a transistor for supplying current to an output node G so as to raise the potential of this node G. An N channel IGFET 84 is a transistor for pouring current from the output node G to a lower source voltage V Now, the operation of the embodiment in Fig. 7 will be described with reference to voltage waveforms in Fig. 8. In the illustration, for the sake of brevity, the potential of a node B₂ is assumed to be held at a fixed value higher than the upper limit value of the potential of the base 76 of the bipolar transistor 83. However, a pulse voltage synchronized with the potential fluctuation of the base 76 may well be applied within a range within which the bipolar transistor 83 is not saturated. Letting the potential of an input node E be V When, under this state, the potential of a node B₁ is boosted to V As a circuit 30 for lowering the potential of the output node G, the circuit in Fig. 5 may be used or the circuit in Fig. 5 and the N channel IGFET 84 connected in parallel may well be used as is necessary. Besides, in a case where the bipolar transistor 83 might be deeply saturated temporarily due to the fluctuation of a supply voltage, etc., a diode may be connected between the nodes B₁ and B₂ as shown in Fig. 6, to prevent the potential of the node B₁ from abnormally rising relative to that of the node B₂. Fig. 9 is an arrangement diagram of a semiconductor device showing a fourth embodiment of the present invention. The point of the greatest difference in circuitry between Fig. 7 and Fig. 9 is that, in Fig. 7, the collector and base of the bipolar transistor 83 are electrically isolated, whereas in Fig. 9, an N channel IGFET 103 is inserted between the collector and base of a bipolar transistor 104 so as to feed a base current and a collector current from a node B₂. Now, the operation of this embodiment will be described. It is assumed that a desired output level be V In this manner, according to the present embodiment, in a circuit which includes a bipolar transistor and an IGFET, an operating reference voltage is set at a value different from the reference voltage of a preceding circuit which controls the above circuit, thereby making it possible to realize a semiconductor device which has a high output amplitude of or above the reference voltage of the preceding circuit while exploiting the high driving capability of the bipolar transistor to the utmost. In the embodiments thus far described, a pulse voltage needs to be impressed on the node B₁. There are various circuits for generating pulse voltages, the circuit arrangements of which are well known, and hence, they shall not be clearly shown here. By way of example, as a circuit which generates pulse voltages as shown by the voltage waveforms in Fig. 8, there is a circuit 256k CMOS Dynamic RAM with Static Column Mode of Cycle Time of 50 ns by Ishihara, Miyazawa and Sakai, shown in Nikkei Electronics , February 11, 1985, pp. 243 263, Fig. 7. Besides, in the embodiments thus far illustrated, the source of a P channel IGFET for example, 25 in Fig. 3 can become a high potential. In this regard, it is needless to say that the potential of the well of the P channel IGFET needs to be held higher than the potential of the source so as to prevent the flow of an excess forward current, namely, the so called latch up from taking place between the source and the well. Further, in the foregoing embodiments, a high voltage can act between the drain and source of an N channel IGFET for example, 29 in Fig. 3 . In this regard, in a case where a problem is posed in point of a breakdown voltage, the voltage acting between the drain and source of the N channel IGFET which is problematic as to the breakdown voltage may be reduced in such a way that an N channel IGFET whose gate potential is V While various uses are considered for the present invention, the invention is particularly suitable for the word driver of a dynamic semiconductor memory. The reason is that the realization of a high speed dynamic semiconductor memory requires to raise the signal to noise ratio by driving a selected word line at high speed and with a large amplitude and increasing a signal amplitude and also to raise the soft error immunity by increasing storage charges. Next, there will be explained an example in the case where the present invention is applied to the word driver of a dynamic semiconductor memory. Fig. 10A is a block diagram of the dynamic semiconductor memory, which shows a memory cell array MCA of N bits and peripheral circuits. In the memory cell array MCA, By applying the circuit of this embodiment to the decoder driver XD in the above arrangement, it is permitted to drive the level of the word line WL at high speed and with a large amplitude, and a dynamic memory of high operating speed and high stability can be realized. In Fig. 10A, the write read circuit RC can also have a part thereof arranged at the end of the memory cell array MCA opposite to the decoder driver YD so as to receive control signals from the decoder driver YD by passing them over the memory cell array MCA. Besides, although the X group address inputs X In that case, the aforementioned write read control circuit may be driven in such a way that signals for controlling the acceptance of addresses, namely, the so called RAS and CAS are substituted for the chip select signal Fig. 11 is a diagram of an embodiment in which the arrangement of Fig. 10A is put into a more concrete form, and which shows parts of the memory cell array MCA and the decoder driver XD more specifically. In Fig. 11, DEC₀ and DEC₁ indicate decoders, WD₀ and WD₁ word drivers, WL₀ and WL₁ word lines, DL₀ and The decoders DEC₀ and DEC₁ operate with reference to a voltage V The circuit arrangement of each of the word drivers WD₀ and WD₁ is the same as that of the circuit D in Fig. 7 except the fact that an N channel IGFET 152 or 166 is disposed in parallel with an N channel IGFET 151 or 165. Now, a reading operation in Fig. 11 will be described in conjunction with voltage waveforms in Fig. 12. In starting the reading operation, the pair of data lines DL₀ and The potential difference between the pair of data lines is amplified by the sense amplifier SA, and data is rewritten into the memory cell and is transmitted to a succeeding circuit. Subsequently, the pulse signal ø Although the example of setting the precharge voltages of the data lines to V In the reading operation stated above, the bipolar transistors in the unselected word drivers, for example, the transistor 168 in the word driver WD₁ have their bases held at O V by the signal ø Meanwhile, the arrangement of Fig. 11 requires the two upper voltage sources of the source for supplying the voltage V Fig. 13 is a diagram of one embodiment of a booster circuit for use in the present invention. In this circuit, the voltage V In case of applying this circuit to the arrangement of Fig. 11, current which must be fed from the node 194 in Fig. 13 increases when the word line is selected. Accordingly, it is also possible to operate both the booster circuits CP₁ and CP₂ for producing the great feed current during the period of time during which the dynamic semiconductor memory is active, and to operate only the booster circuit CP₁ during the period of time during which the memory stands by. Thus, a great output current can be attained with a low power consumption. Fig. 14 is a diagram exemplifying the voltage waveforms of the pulses which are impressed on the booster circuits CP₁ and CP₂ in Fig. 13. In the illustrated example, only the booster circuit CP₁ operates during the standby period t Although the example employing the two charge pump circuits has been shown here, it is a matter of course that one circuit or three or more circuits may well be employed as is necessary. Besides, when the potential of the word line is raised very fast, the potential of the node 194 in Fig. 13 sometimes lowers temporarily. In that case, in order to prevent the saturation of a bipolar transistor whose collector has the node 194 connected thereto, the capacitance of the node 194 needs to be increased so as to reduce the lowering of the potential. To this end, all the collectors of bipolar transistors for feeding the voltage V In a case where a bipolar transistor might be temporarily saturated by the fluctuation of a supply voltage, the saturation may be prevented in such a way that a diode is connected between the output node of the circuit for generating the pulse signal ø As described above, according to the present invention, in a circuit which includes a bipolar transistor and an IGFET, the reference voltage of the operation thereof is set at a value different from that of the reference operating voltage of a preceding circuit for controlling the above circuit, so that the high driving capability of the bipolar transistor is sufficiently exploited, while at the same time a desired high output level can be attained. Fig. 15A shows a sixth embodiment of the present invention. In the figure, a bipolar transistor Q Fig. 15B shows an embodiment of a voltage limiter included in the arrangement of Fig. 15A. Here, the potential of the node S Thus, the control of the off level can be readily performed without incurring the saturation of the bipolar transistor Q In the base current control circuit C₁ in Fig. 15A, a CMOS inverter circuit is constructed of a p channel IGFET M While the above embodiment is the circuit in which the base current flows when the input node I₁ is at the low level, a circuit in which a base current flows when an input node I₁ is at a high level can be readily realized. Fig. 16 shows such an embodiment. Referring to the figure, a circuit C₁ is constructed of four IGFETs, among which the p channel IGFET M Fig. 17 shows an embodiment in which the circuit C₁ in Fig. 15A is constructed of MIS transistors and a bipolar transistor. This embodiment is a circuit in which, likewise to the embodiment of Fig. 15A, current is caused to flow to the base B when the input node I₁ is at the low level, and it is cut off when the input node I₁ is at the high level. The point of difference from Fig. 15A is that the p channel MIS transistor M While, in the above, the embodiment for the circuit C₁ in Fig. 15A has been stated, embodiments for the circuit C₂ will be described below. Fig. 18 shows an example in which the circuit C₂ is constructed of a single n channel MIS transistor M Fig. 19 shows an embodiment in which the circuit C₂ is constructed including a bipolar transistor. The gate G₇ of an n channel MIS transistor M According to Embodiment 6, in a driving circuit which is constructed including a bipolar transistor, a source for supplying the base current of the bipolar transistor and a source for supplying the collector current are isolated, so that a base potential and a collector potential can be controlled independently, whereby an off level can be set at will and at high precision with the saturation of the bipolar transistor prevented. Next, a seventh embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to Fig. 20. Letter C indicates an input node from a preceding circuit, and letter D an output node. With the circuit of the embodiment, an output of large amplitude D is obtained from an input of small amplitude C. Symbols B₁, B₂ and B₃ denote nodes for applying high D.C. or pulse voltages. The node B₁ of them supplies the high voltage to a node F through a switch 12, the node B₂ supplies the high voltage to the source of a p MOSFET 13, and the node B₃ supplies the high voltage to the collector of a bipolar transistor 15. These nodes B₁, B₂ and B₃ may be isolated, but two or all of them may well be connected. Letter A indicates the control node of switching means 11. The output voltage is raised by the bipolar transistor 15, and it is lowered by a circuit block 16. The p MOS transistor 13 and an n MOS transistor 14 serve to control the bipolar transistor 15. The number of inputs can be freely altered by increasing or decreasing the number of the switches 11 in Fig. 20. In Fig. 20 and embodiments to be described later, the high voltage side of the input of small amplitude C or the control input A shall be written V Now, the operation of the embodiment in Fig. 20 will be described. First, when the input node C becomes a low potential with the switch 11 in its on state and the switch 12 in its off state, the node F becomes the low potential to turn on the p MOSFET 13 and off the n MOSFET 14. As a result, the base potential G of the bipolar transistor 15 becomes V Examples of the arrangement of the preceding circuit which is connected to the input C in Fig. 20 are shown in Figs. 23, 24, 25 and 26. Fig. 26 shows a bipolar CMOS hybrid gate circuit. All the examples have a 3 input NAND function. Since the reference voltage is as low as V Next, an eighth embodiment is shown in Fig. 27. Unlike the embodiment of Fig. 20, this embodiment forms a switch 12 by the use of a p MOS transistor, the source of which is connected with the source of a p MOS transistor 13 into a node B₁. Now, the operations of this circuit will be described with reference to voltage waveform diagrams in Figs. 28 and 29. Fig. 28 corresponds to a case where the node of the gate A of an n MOS transistro 11 is at a high potential V While the switch 12 has been constructed of the p MOS transistor in Embodiment 8 of Fig. 27, it can also be constructed of an n MOS transistor as shown in Embodiment 9 of Fig. 30. On this occasion, the phase of the control signal E needs to be inverted to those in Figs. 28 and 29. Further, in this case, the high potential of the node E needs to be set at V The above is a system wherein the node A switch 11 and the node E switch 12 are synchronized, that is, a system wherein the switch 11 is infallibly turned off before the switch 12 is turned on and wherein the switch 12 is infallibly turned off before the switch 11 is turned on . Next, there will be explained a system wherein the node E is made common with the node G. An embodiment in Fig. 31 is such that the switch 12 is constructed of a p MOS transistor and is controlled with the output G of the succeeding CMOS transistor, thereby to dispense with the control signal E in Embodiments 8 and 9. The operation of the circuit in Fig. 31 will be described with reference to a voltage waveform diagram in Fig. 32. First, when the input C becomes the low potential O V under the state under which the control input A of the switch 11 is the high potential V In Fig. 32, the control input A of the switch 11 has been normally held at the high potential. In case of impressing a pulse voltage on the control input A, however, when the input A is at the high potential, the output D can be changed according to the input C as described above, and when the input A is at the low potential, the output D can be held in the previous fixed state of the high potential or low potential irrespective of the change of the input C. According to Embodiment 10 stated above, it becomes possible to obtain the output D of large amplitude from the input C of small amplitude without requiring any external surplus pulse signal. In the embodiments of Figs. 27, 30 and 31 thus far described, the switch 12 has been constructed of the MOS transistor. Further, it is an embodiment in Fig. 33 that constructs the switch 12 out of a diode bipolar or MOS diode , not the MOS transistor. Fig. 34 is a voltage waveform diagram of the embodiment. The system of Fig. 34 normally holds the gate of the n MOS transistor of the switch 11 at the high potential V Further, it is an embodiment in Fig. 35 that employs the system of Fig. 31 jointly with the system wherein the switch 12 is controlled with the control signal E as in Fig. 27 described before. In Fig. 35, a transistor 121 p MOS is a switch which sets the node F at the high potential V Any of the embodiments thus far described corresponds to the case of one input C and one output D , but a case of many inputs can also be constructed by connecting a large number of switches 11 in parallel in conformity with the number of the inputs. By way of example, an embodiment in which the arrangement of Fig. 31 is modified to have 3 inputs is shown in Fig. 36. In Fig. 36, the 3 inputs C₁, C₂, C₃ and signals A₁, A₂ and A₃ for controlling them are respectively applied to switches 111, 112 and 113. With the present circuit, any of the inputs C₁ C₃ of the switches whose signals A In any of the foregoing embodiments, the bipolar transistor has been employed at the output in order to raise the output level fast. In the following comparative example the bipolar transistor is removed. Therefore, the operating speed is inferior but an output of a large amplitude can be obtained from an input of small amplitude. Next, such arrangements will be explained. Fig. 37 and Fig. 38 show these examples. Fig. 37 of them corresponds to Fig. 20, and Fig. 38 corresponds to Fig. 27. In both examples, the output charging bipolar transistor 15 and the discharging n MOS transistor 16 in Figs. 20 and 27 are omitted. The operations and voltage waveforms of the circuits are as have already stated. With these circuits, the rise of the output becomes slow because of the absence of the bipolar transistor, whereas there is the advantage that the potential V Hereinafter, further embodiments of a semiconductor storage device hereinbelow, simply termed memory will be explained. Fig. 39 shows one embodiment of a decoder as well as word drivers. Symbol DEC denotes the decoder circuit, and symbols WD₀, WD₁, WD₂ and WD₃ denote the word drivers. The circuit of the embodiment in Fig. 27 is employed for the word driver. In this circuit arrangement, the output C of the single decoder circuit is shared by the four word drivers. Switches 111, 112, 113 and 114 constructed of n MOS transistors are interposed between the decoder and the word drivers, and they are respectively controlled by signals AT₀, AT₁, AT₂ and AT₃. P₁ and P₂ indicate precharge signals for the decoder and the word drivers respectively, and in the standby mode or precharge period of the memory, the point C is charged to V Fig. 41 shows an embodiment in which the circuit of Fig. 35 is employed for the word driver. While the controls of the decoder and the word drivers can be performed similarly to the case of Fig. 40, these word drivers can attain both the stabilization and raised speed of the operation as stated in conjunction with Fig. 35. More specifically, when the signal P₂ is at the high potential and the decoder output C is at the high potential, or when the signal P₂ is at the high potential and the switches 111 114 are off , the potentials of the points F₀ F₃ can be stably held at V Fig. 42 shows an embodiment which stabilizes the operation of the word driver more and which is characterized, when compared with the embodiment of Fig. 41, in that an n MOS transistor 123 is further added. With this circuit, when the signal P₂ is off and one or more of the switches 111 114 is are off , the corresponding node or nodes F₀ F₃ can be stably held at the high potential V Further, Fig. 43 shows an arrangement in which the word driver in Fig. 37 is applied to the circuit in Fig. 39. Since no bipolar transistor is required, the cost of production can be lowered. The circuit operation is almost equal to that of the circuit in Fig. 39, and shall be omitted from the description. Figs. 39 43 have illustrated the examples of word drivers of the memory. Portions where an input of small amplitude needs to be converted into an output of large amplitude at high speed are not restricted to the word drivers of the memory, but they are extensively existent in the input output circuits of the memory and other general integrated circuits. Fig. 44 shows such a general example. The illustrated arrangement is such that a signal is derived from a small amplitude circuit system 45 which operates with a reference voltage V Each of the arrangements in Figs. 20 44 requires the two upper voltage sources of the source for supplying the voltage V As the booster circuit, the arrangement described with reference to Figs. 13 and 14 may be used. In case of applying this circuit to the embodiment of Fig. 39 or the example of Fig. 43, current which must be fed from the node 194 in Fig. 13 increases when the word line is selected. Accordingly, it is also possible to operate both the booster circuits CP₁ and CP₂ for producing the great feed current during the period of time during which the semiconductor memory is active, and to operate only the booster circuit CP₁ during the period of time during which the memory stands by. Thus, a great output current can be attained with a low power consumption. As described above, according to the present invention, in a circuit which includes a MOS transistor, a reference operating voltage is set at a value different from the reference operating voltage of a preceding circuit which controls the above circuit, so that a desired output voltage of large amplitude can be obtained.
