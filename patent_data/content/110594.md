The thread 26 is received in notches 10 in one edge 4 of the strip 2 so that rotation of the screw 12, 12a advances the strip 2 . Guides 44 are provided for guiding the strip 2 along the feed path and maintaining the strip in engagement with the thread 26 . The thread 26 may have a portion 34 of each turn which causes no feeding during each revolution so that strip is fed intermittently. The feeding apparatus may be used under a wide variety of cir cumstances and is disclosed in conjunction with a stamping and forming or similar machine 70 .
