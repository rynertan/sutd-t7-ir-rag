# Magnetically localizable, biodegradable lipid microspheres.

## Abstract
A drug carrier formulation consisting of magnetically lo calizable, biodegradable lipid microspheres containing a mag netically responsive substance, one or more diodegradable lipids and one or more nontoxic surfactants is described here in. There is also described a process for preparing such mi crospheres wherein the magnetically responsive substance is wetted with surfactant and part of the lipids, then this material is added to the remaining lipids and heated to 90 100 C., water is added, the mixture is sonicated to obtain a microemulsion, which is then cooled and lyophilized to obtain the product.
