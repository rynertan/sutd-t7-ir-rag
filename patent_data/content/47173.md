## Description
MDTI0D AND APPARATUS FOR USE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER AND PAPERBOARD The present invention relates to the manufacture of paper and paperboard or boxboard from non woven webs of fibrous cellulosic material and, more particularly, to the manufacture of such non woven webs from dry mechanically prepared wood pulp. In the conventional wet forming process for the manufacture of paper and board, there is inevitably a large consumption of water in the preparation of the aqueous cellulosic stock. This not only results in a high overall consumption of energy, but also in potential pollution of water supplies by effluent, unless expensive preventive action is taken. It is an object of the present invention to reduce the quantity of water required in the manufacture of paper web and to reduce the overall energy requirements of the paper making process. The invention consists in a method of manufacturing paper or paperboard in which a non woven web of fibrous cellulosic material is wet formed on a travelling foraminous forming band and dewatered, characterised by the steps of providing dry mechanically prepared pulp, adding water thereto and mixing to form an aqueous stock, wet laying the stock onto the forming band to form the web, partially dewatering the web, and consolidating the partially dewatered web by the application of heat and pressure thereto. The invention also consists in apparatus for manufacturing paper or paperboard in which a non woven web of fibrous cellulosic material is wet formed on a travelling foraminous forming band and dewatered, characterised by defibering and mixing means for providing dry mechanically prepared pulp and mixing water therewith to produce an aqueous stock, means for wet laying said stock onto the band to produce the web thereon, dewatering means for partially dewatering said web, and consolidating means for console, dating the partially dewatered web by means of the application of heat and pressure thereto. The dry mechanical pulp used in the method of this invention may include waste paper. Preferably, water is added to the dry pulp and mixed to form an aqueous stock containing about 99 by weight of water. The web wetlaid on the forming band or wire may be partially dewatered to a solids content of about 10 20 by weight by vacuum dewatering. It may be consolidated by advancing the partially dewatered web, supported by the forming band, through one or more pressure nips provided between one or more heated drying cylinders and cooperating pressure rollers, whilst retaining the web in contact with the or each cylinder, for at least a part of the circumference thereof, by means of the forming band.Preferably, the web is advanced through a plurality of pressure nips spaced around the or each drying cylinder, whilst supported by the forming band, the linear pressure applied by these nps being in the range from 8.5 180 kg cm and the temperature of the or each drying cylinder being in the range from 65 250 0C. The invention enables a drying rate of 50 300 kg sq m of effective drying surface per hour to be attained, thus providing a substantial overall reduction in energy requirements for drying the web and in the space required for drying compared with the drying arrangements in presently known paper machines. The fast drying at high temperatures and nip pressures obtainable with the invention improves web characteristics, including strength and formation. The reduced water usage in the preparation of the stock alleviates effluent pollution. In this regard, water is only added to the dry mechanical pulp immediately prior to the wet forming process. In order that the present invention may be more readily understood, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic side elevation of a first embodiment of paper making machine in accordance with this invention for producing a single ply wet formed paper web Fig. 2 is a diagrammatic side elevation of a second embodiment for producing a three ply wet formed web Fig. 3 is a diagrammatic side elevation of a third embodiment for producing a three ply composite web of both wet formed and dry formed layers and Fig. 4 is a block diagram illustrating the steps of the process of this invention. Referring to Fig. 1 of the drawings, dry wood pulp is disintegrated and defibered in dry pulping apparatus,.such as, breaker equipment, i.e. a hammer mill, followed by a refiner or hammer mill. Such apparatus is diagram matically illustrated at 1 in Fig. 1. The dry particulor fibrous ate pulp thus produced is fed to a mixer unit, diagram matically illustrated at 2, where it is mixed with water, which is delivered to the mixer by a pipe 4 leading from a water supply 5, by means of a stirrer 3.The aqueous stock produced by the mixer may, for example, have a consistency of about 9 ss by weight of water0 The dry pulping apparatus 1, mixer unit 2, stirrer 3, pipe 4 and water supply 5 are collectively represented by a box 6, which is shown in broken outline in Fig. 1 and which will henceforth be used in Figs. 2 and 3 to indicate the equipment for defibering dry pulp and mixing it with water to form aqueous cellulosic stock, preferably, having the aforesaid consistency. Hereinafter, the equipment diagrammatically represented by the box 6 will be referred to as the defibering and mixing unit . Stock is supplied from the defibering and mixing unit 6 to an explosion chamber flowbox 10, which may, for example, be of the type described in British Patent No. 1548924 issued to St. Anne s Board Mill Company Limited, and is wet laid from the flowbox onto an endless travelling foraminous forming band or wire 11 to form a web of, for example, 120 gms sq m in weight. Disposed immediately beneath the flowbox outlet is a vacuum dewatering box 12 which reduces the water content of the stock, for example, from 99 to about 90 . A second vacuum dewatering box 13 disposed downstream of the dewatering box 12 further reduces the water content of the web, for example, to about 85 by weight, that is, about 15 solids. Downstream of the dewatering box 13, the web, together with the forming band 11 which travels, for example, at a speed of about 70 m min, is advanced through a first pressdrying stage comprising a series of pressure nips 15,16,17 spaced around the circumference of a rotating heated drying cylinder 18 and defined by pressure rollers 19,20,21 cooperating with the drying cylinder. The latter may, for example, be 1.5 m in diameter and be heated by steam at a pressure of 2.1 kg sq cm to give a surface temperature of about 1150C. The pressure exerted on the web and band by the nips 15,16,17 may, for example, be arranged to increase progressively from a linear pressure of 0 kg cm at the nip 15 to 35 kg cm at the nip 17. Over the parts of the circumference of the drying cylinder between the pressure nips, the web is retained pressed in contact with the cylinder by the forming band 11. Upon leaving the nip 17, the web and band are guided about the pressure roller. 21 to a similar second pressdrying stage comprising a series of pressure nips 22,23,24 provided between a second rotating heated drying cylinder 25 and cooperating pressure rollers 26,27,28 spaced about the circumference of the drying cylinder. The forming band 11 retains the web in contact with the parts of the circumference of the drying cylinder 25 between the pressure nips 22,23,24.The drying cylinder 25 may be similar to the cylinder 18 and, likewise, be heated to a surface temperature of 115 C. The pressure rollers 26,27,28 may be arranged to exert a linear pressure of 35 kg cm on the web. Upon leaving the final pressure nip 24, the resultant web 29 may have a solids content of, for example, 25 4 X by weight. It is removed from the nip 24 and separated from the forming band via a take off roller 30, whereupon it is fed to further drying equipment which may, for example, be in the form of press driers as described in British PatentNo. 1424682 issued to St. Anne s Board Mill Company LimitedThe forming band 11 is removed from the nip 24 about the pressure roller 28 and is returned to the head roller 31 adjacent the flowbox 10 via guide and tensioning rollers 32. Fig. 2 illustrates a three ply paper making machine including a main forming and press drying section of similar construction to the apparatus described with reference to Fig.1, In Fig. 2, fibrous cellulosic stocks produced in defibering and mixing units 6 from dry pulp are wet laid from explosion chamber flowboxes 40,41,42 onto endless travelling foraminous forming bands 43,44,45, respectively, to form wet laid plies on these forming bands. The latter travel, respectively, about vacuum forming or dewatering rollers 46,47,48, disposed immediately underneath the outlets from the associated flowboxes. These vacuum forming rollers reduce the water content of the respective webs, for example, to about 85 by weight. Downstream of the forming rollers 47,48, the web on forming band 44 is transferred onto the web on the forming band 45 by transfer rollers 49 and a vacuum box 50. The band 44 is thereafter returned to the vacuum forming roller 47 via guide and tensioning roller 51.The resultant two ply web supported on the band 45 is advanced about a roller 52 and is transferred from the band 45, onto the web laid on the forming band 43, by transfer rollers 53 and a vacuum box 54, whereafter the forming band 45 is returned to the vacuum roller 48 via guide and tensioning rollers 55. Downstream of the transfer apparatus 53,54, the three ply web is consolidated by advancing it, together with the band 43, through a press drying stage comprising a series of pressure nips 56,57,58 spaced around the circumference of a rotating heated drying cylinder 59 and defined by pressure rollers 60,61,62. Between the pressure nips, the web is pressed into contact with the drying cylinder by the forming band 43. As in the previous embodiment, the drying cylinder 58 may, for example, be 1.5 m in diameter and be steam heated to a surface temperature of about 1150C.Also, the linear pressure exerted by the nips may increase progressively from 0 35 kg cm. The resultant three ply web 63 is removed from the nip 58 and separated from the band 43 by a take bff roller 64 and may, for example have a solids content of 25 40 p by weight. It may then be fed to further drying equipnent which may be in the form of press driers of the type described in the aforementioned British PatentNo. 1424682. The forming band 43 is returned to the vacuum forming roller 46 associated with the flowbox 40 via guide and tensioning rollers 64. Fig. 3 illustrates a paper making machine for forming a three ply composite cellulosic web of both wet laid and dry laid fibrous cellulosic material and incorporates apparatus similar to that described with reference to Fig. 1.Referring to Fig. 3, wet fibrous cellulosic stock, which is prepared in a defibering and mixing unit 6 from a dry pulp, is laid from a first explosion chamber flowbox 70 onto a main endless foraminous forming band 71 to form a first ply which is immediately dewatered by a vacuum dewatering box 72.It may be partially dewatered by the box 72 to a solids content of, for example, about 15 by weight. Wet cellulosic stock, also prepared in a defibering and mixing unit 6 from dry pulp, is laid from a second,explosion chamber flowbox 73 onto a second endless forming band 74 to form a second ply, which is immediately dewatered by a vacuum dewatering box 75 to a solids content, for example, of about 15 by weight. Dry cellulosic fibres are dry laid from a distributor 76, which may be of the construction shown in either of British Patents Nos. 1424682 or 1516573 issued to St.Anne s Board Mill Company Limited, onto an endless forming band 77 to form a third, dry laid ply. Deposition of this dry laid ply is assisted by suction box 78 disposed beneath the distributor 76. The dry laid ply is transferred from the band 77 onto the wet ply on the band 74, downstream of the flowbox 73 and a guide roller 79, by means of transfer rollers 80 and a vacuum box 81. The band 77 is then returned to the distributor 76 via guide and tensioning rollers 82. The composite two ply web supported on the band 74 is advanced about a guide roller 83 and is transferred onto the wet laid web on the band 71 by means of transfer rollers 84 and a vacuum box 85 to form a three ply web comprising the dry laid ply sandwiched between the two wet plies. This three ply web may have a weight, for example, of about 250 gms sq m. The band 74 is returned to the flowbox 73 via guide and tensioning rollers 86. The three ply web deposited on the forming band71, which may, for example, travel at a speed of 50 m min, is consolidated by advancing it successively through two pressdrying stages comprising pressure nips 87 91 spaced about the circumferences of two heated drying cylinders 92,93. The construction of these press drying stages is similar to that of Fig. 1 and between the pressure nips the web is retained in contact with the associated drying cylinders by the band 71. The drying cylinder 92 may, for example, have a diameter of 1.5 m and be steam heated to give a surface temperature of 1300C. As in the previous embodiments, the linear pressure exerted by the pressure nips associated with the cylinder 92 may be arranged to increase progressively from 0 35 kg cm.In these circumstances, the three ply web leaving the nip 89 has a moisture content of about 85 . The drying cylinder 93 may, for example, be heated to a 0 temperature of 110 C for further drying of the web to a moisture content of about 70 . Thebes 94 is removed from the final nip 91 and separated from the band 71 via a takeoff roller 95 for further drying, as required. The forming band 71 is returned to the head roller 96 via guide and tensioning rollers 97. In a modification of Fig. 3, a further eight pressure nips on two drying cylinders not shown heated to similar temperatures and employing similar pressures may be disposed downstream of the cylinder 93 to reduce the moisture content of the web, for example, to about 15ffi. Instead of the dry laid web formed on the band 77, a further wet laid web may be produced using an explosion chamber flowbox instead of the dry laying distributor 76.Alternatively, systems such as foam forming or high consistency forming can be used. The process of this invention is diagrammatically illustrated in Fig. 4. It comprises preparing dry cellulosic fibre in a first stage 100, mixing the dry fibre with water in a second stage 101 to produce an aqueous fibrous cellulosic stock having a consistency of 99 water, wetforming a non woven web of the stock in a third stage 102, and consolidating the web in a fourth stage 103 by pressdrying to produce a self supporting paper web. In one specific example, dry prepared fluting medium was mixed with water to produce an aqueous stock having a consistency of 99 water, and then the stock was wet formed and press dried to give a fluting medium product. In a second specific example, thermo mechanical pulp was prepared in the dry state, mixed with water, as in the first example, and then the resulting stock was wet formed and press dried to give a sheet of paperboard. This invention, as well as economising on the use of water in the preparation of stock, provides a single dewatering system with high dewatering capacity. The web produced can exhibit essentially square characteristics, that is, its strength and stiffness in the machine direction is substantially in a 1 1 ratio with the strength and stiffness in the cross machine direction. Subsequently pressdrying can result in the web characteristics described in the aforementioned British Patent No. 1424682. Whilst particular embodiments have been described, it will be understood that modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention, as defined by the appended claims. For example, for special purposes, the number of pressure rollers associated with an individual drying cylinder may be increased to four, five or even six and the range of linear nip pressures may extend to 180 kg cm.Likewise, the temperature of the drying cylinders may be varied from 65 2500C depending on the furnishes provided and the desired characteristics of the final web.
