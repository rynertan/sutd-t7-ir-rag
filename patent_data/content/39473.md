# Hydraulic power transmission system.

## Abstract
A hydraulic system comprising a pair of actuators 10 operable to move a single load L , each of which has a fluid inlet, a variable displacement pump 12 including means 16 responsive to a pressure for vary ing the displacement of the pump, a pilot operated meter in valve 14 associated with each actuator 10 for supplying fluid from the pump 12 to its respective actuator 10 , and means 17, 18, 20 for sensing the pressures between each meter in valve 14 and its associated actuator 10 and applying an average of said pressures to said responsive means 16 of said pump 12 .
