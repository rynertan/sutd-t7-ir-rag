## Description
This invention relates to inorganic foamed granules and a process for the preparation of the same. Inorganic foamed granules are lightweight, and are accordingly employed widely as lightweight aggregates for construction of buildings, extenders for fertilizer, detergent or paint, absorbents, soil improvers, etc. Typical known inorganic foamed granules are classified into two groups, namely, artificial material originating balloons such as glass balloons which are obtained from artificial raw materials, and natural material originating balloons such as volcanic ash balloons, perlite, fly ash balloon and expanded shale. The glass balloons are foamed granules and are obtained by expanding granules comprising sodium silicate as the main component which are produced by a liquid drop method or a dry gelation method. The volcanic ash balloons are produced by heating volcanic ash containing volcanic glass to foam the ash. The perlite is likewise produced by heating pearlite, obsidian volcanic glass , rosinous sand, trachyte or the like to foam it. The fly ash balloons are produced by firing dust coal and subjecting the resulting coal ash to floatation in water. The expanded shale is produced by foaming a shale by heating. With respect to the known foamed granules, certain drawbacks are noted. For instance, the preparation of the glass balloons requires complicated procedures. The preparation of the volcanic ash balloons, perlite, expanded shale, etc. requires digging of minerals from mountainous area and pulverizing the digged minerals. Thus, the preparation of natural material originating balloons is not economical from the viewpoint of the preparatin of the raw material. Further, the natural raw materials, namely, minerals recently are less available, because the digging work possibly causes environmental disruption. The fly ash balloons are contained in coal ashes which are by produced in a thermoelectric power plant and accordingly are not available stably. Furthermore, most of known inorganic foamed granules have a bulk density unit weight in the range of 0.02 to 0.05 kg ℓ or 0.15 to 0.4 kg ℓ, and there are relatively few inorganic foamed granules having a bulk density between these two range. It is an object of the present invention to provide novel inorganic foamed granules. It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of the novel inorganic foamed granules. It is a further object of the invention to provide a new use for residue produced in a coal gasification process, which has not found advantageous use until now. There is provided by the present invention an inorganic foamed granule comprising 60 wt. or less of SiO₂, 20 wt. or more of Aℓ₂O₃, and 5 wt. or more of CaO and having a bulk density in the range of 0.05 to 1.2 kg ℓ. The inorganic foamed granules of the present invention are novel inorganic foamed granules having a composition clearly different from various known inorganic foamed granules such as glass balloons, volcanic ash balloons, perlite, fly ash balloons and expanded shale. The inorganic foamed granules of the invention are easily prepared by a process comprising heating an amorphous residue obtained by partial oxidation of coal, at a temperature of not lower than 600 In one aspect, the inorganic foamed granules of the invention preferably have a bulk density i.e., unit weight in the range of 0.05 to 0.6 kg ℓ, which can be prepared by heating ashes residue of granular size of not greater than 20 mm obtained by partial oxidation of coal, at a temperature in the range of 700 1,200 In another aspect, the inorganic foamed granules of the invention preferably have a bulk density i.e., unit weight in the range of 0.6 not inclusive to 1.2 kg ℓ, which can be prepared by heating ashes residue of granular size of not greater than 2.5 mm obtained by partial oxidation of coal, at a temperature in the range of 650 850 Fig. 1 illustrates graphically a variation of the diameter of a residue of coal gasification process which has a mean diameter of 10 mm at a temperature rising from 400 Fig. 2 illustrates graphically a relationship between the heating temperature and the bulk density i.e., unit weight of the foamed granules obtained from Residue I, Residue II and obsidian in Example 2 and Comparison Example 2. The inorganic foamed granules of the invention are prepared from a coal residue which is produced in a coal gasification process and which previously has not found effective use. The above mentioned coal residue is easily foamed at a temperature lower than the conventionally employed minerals. Accordingly, the present invention is of value from the viewpoint of effective use of previously wasted by products. Further, the present invention is of value from the viewpoint of energy saving in the process of the preparation of inorganic foamed granules. The inorganic foamed granules of the invention are light in weight and have high strength. Further, the inorganic foamed granules of the invention have low thermal conductivity and hence show an increased heat insulating property. Furthermore, if desired, water absorbing capacity of the foamed granules can be easily varied through variation of preparation conditions therefor. Accordingly, the inorganic foamed granules of the invention find a wide variety of uses. The inorganic foamed granules of the invention are granules comprising SiO₂, CaO and Aℓ₂O₃. In addition to these three main componets, the foamed granules possibly and advantageously contain iron oxide, MgO, Na₂O and K₂O. The inorganic foamed granules of the invention comprise 60 wt. or less, preferably 30 60 wt. , of SiO₂, 20 wt. or more, preferably 20 40 wt. of Aℓ₂O₃, and 5 wt. or more, preferably 5 30 wt. , of CaO. These three indispensable components are comprised in the inorganic foamed granules in a total amount of, generally, not less than 60 wt. , preferably 70 95 wt. , and most preferably 75 90 wt. . In addition to the three indispensable components, the foamed granules of the invention possibly and advantageously contain iron oxide, MgO, Na₂O and K₂O in a total amount of, generally, not more than 40 wt. , preferably 5 30 wt. , and most preferably 10 25 wt. , all being based on the amount of the foamed granules. Preferably, iron oxide is contained in an amount of 2 15 wt. as Fe₂O₃ , MgO is contained in an amount of 1 7 wt. , Na₂O is contained in an amount of 1 6 wt. , and K₂O is contained in an amount of O 2 wt. , all being based on the amount of the foamed granules. Further, the inorganic foamed granules of the invention may contain a very small amount of TiO₂, SO₃, sulfide, other sulfur containing compounds and carbonaceous components. The inorganic foamed granules of the invention are lightweight granules having a unit weight in the range of 0.05 to 1.2 kg ℓ. This range of unit weight can be expressed in terms of a specific gravity under oven dry of approx. 0.1 to 2.1. Since the inorganic foamed granules of the invention are so lightweight, these are advantageously employed as lightweight aggregates. The inorganic foamed granules of the invention have void in the granule. The void can be an independent closed void or a continuous void. Either of foamed graules having a relatively great number of closed voids and foamed granules having a relatively great number of continuous void can be prepared as desired, by controlling, for instance, the heating temperature and or heating period in the process of their production. The inorganic foamed granules predominantly having closed voids show extremely low water absorption. In the case that the foamed granules of this type are used as lightweight aggregates for admixing with a cement, the amount of water to be introduced into the mixture can be decreased. Therefore, a cured cement using the closed void type granules shows a high strength and is prominently durable under repeated freezing thawing conditions. The foamed granules predominantly having a continuous void show a high water retention ability, and hence are advantageously employed as a soil improver. The foamed granules of the invention contain a great number of voids, and accordingly these show low thermal conductivity, generally, 0.05 kcal m h The inorganic foamed granules of the inventicn show higher mechanical strength than the conventional inorganic foamed granules. Generally, an average crushing strength of the foamed granules of the invention is not lower than 2.5 kgf the mean value is obtained using 20 foamed granules having particle sizes within 2 10 mm which are selected at random . Further, the inorganic foamed granules of the invention having a unit weight in the range of 0.6 to 1.2 kg ℓ granular size not greater than 3.5 mm, advantageously from 0.5 to 2.8 mm show prominently higher mechanical strength such as an average crushing strength in the range of 10 to 70 kgf. Accordingly, the inorganic foamed granules of the invention is very resistant to disruption in their storage or transportation. Further, the use of the inorganic foamed granules as the lightweight aggregates in building structural units is very advantageous to increase the mechanical strength of structural units. There is no specific limitation on the granular size of the inorganic foamed granules of the invention, and the foamed granules of any granular size can be employed according to their uses. Generally, the granular size ranges from approx. 50 µm to 50 mm, and a granular size i.e., particle size in the range of approx. 0.5 to 20 mm is preferred. A process of the preparation of the inorganic foamed granules of the invention is described below. The inorganic foamed granules of the invention are prepared by heating an amorphous residue obtained by partial oxidation of coal under specific conditions. Thus, the raw material for the preparation of the inorganic foamed granules of the invention is an amorphous residue obtained by partial oxidation of coal. An ash obtained upon completely firing a particulate coal does not effectively foam and cannot be used for the preparation of the inorganic foamed granules of the invention. The amorphous residue obtained by partial oxidation of coal for the use in the process for the preparation of the inorganic foamed granules of the invention contains granules having a granular size of not greater than 0.6 mm in an amount of not more than 20 wt. . This amorphous residue is further preferred to contain sulfur in the form of sulfides and unburnt carbon in a total amount of not more than 1 wt. . The amorphous residue advantageously employable for the preparation of the inorganic foamed granules of the invention is available as a residue produced by a process of a synthetic gas through partial oxidation of coal. Examples of the process of the preparation of synthetic gas from coal include Lurgi process, Winkler process, Koppers Totzek process, Otto Rummel process, KDV process, Lurgi slagging process, Synthane process, WH process, Ugas process, HYGAS process, Japan Coal Technology Institute process, Pressure fuidizin hydrogenatic gasification process, Hybrid process, HTW process, BIGAS process, Shell Shell Koppers process, Saarberg Otto process, Sumitomo process, and Texaco process. As the raw materials for the preparation of the foamed granules of the invention, residues obtained in coal gasification processs such as Koppers Totzek process, Otto Rummel process, Lurgi slagging process, Shell Shell Koppers process, and Texaco process in which the partial oxidation of coal is performed at a temperature of not lower than the softening temperature of ash i.e., residue of the employed coal within a gasification furnace are preferably used. For instance, Texaco process includes the following procedure coal is charged into a coal gasification furnace in the form of a aqueous slurry and heated under pressure at a temperature of not lower than the softening temperature of ash of the coal, generally, in the range of 1,300 to 1,500 The composition of the residue obtained upon partial oxidation of coal varies with nature of the coal employed in the coal gasification process within certain ranges. However, most of residues obtained upon partial oxidation of coal can be employed as the raw material, regardless of nature of the coal used. The above described residue generally contains 55 30 wt. of SiO₂, 20 40 wt. of Aℓ₂O₃, and 5 30 wt. of CaO, as well as a small amount of sulfides, other sulfur compounds, and unburnt carbon. There is no specific limitation on the granular size of the residue employed in the process of the preparation of the inorganic foamed granules of the invention. However, granular residue having a size of not greater than 20 mm is generally employed. A granular residue having a size of not greater than 0.3 mm, particularly not greater than 0.15 mm, sometimes does not effectively foam under certain heating conditions or is apt to fuse with other granular residues. Accordingly, such fine granules are advantageously removed in advance of the heat treatment, unless specifically fine foamed granules are desired. The adjustement of the granular size of the residue exhausted from a coal gasification furnace can be advantageously done by crushing and sieving. While most of the granular residue having a size of not greater than 0.15 mm is removed by the sieving, a certain portion of the fine granules attached to greater granules remain unsieved. Such a small amount of the fine granular residue does not disturb foaming of the granules of greater sizes, so long as the amount of the fine granules does not exceed 20 wt. . In the case that a fine granular residue such as a granular residue having a size of not greater than 0.3 mm, particularly not greater than 0.15 mm is to be foamed, it is preferably heated at a relatively low temperature upon separation thereof from greater granules, whereby efficiently producing fine inorganic foamed granules porous granules . The residue which is thus adjusted with respect to the granular size is then heated. The heating is performed at a temperature of not lower than 600 The heating can be carried out, for instance, by heating the residue in a rotary kiln at gradually rising temperatures, by directly charging the residue into a temperature controlled furnace. The heating process using the gradually rising temperature is advantageously utilized particularly in industry. In the industrial process using a rotary kiln, the rate of temperature elevation is prferably set not to exceed 20 In the case that the residue is charged directly into the pre heated furnace, the foaming of the residue is strongly influenced by the heating conditions such as the heating temperature and heating period. The control of the foaming can be done by varying the heating temperature and heating period independently or in combination. According to the study of the present inventors, the favorable foaming is effectively attained when the residue is heated at a temperature of not lower than 600 The heating process for preparing the inorganic foamed granules of the invention can be performed at a temperature lower than and for a period of time shorter than those of the conventional processes for the preparation of volcanic ash balloons and perlite. In more detail, a trachyte having a mean granular size of 3 5 mm gives foamed granules having a unit weight of 0.135 kg ℓ upon being heated at 1,200 Accordingly, the inorganic foamed granules of the invention can be prepared utilizing a heat energy less than that required in the preparation of the conventional foamed granules. Further, the foamed granules of the invention can be prepared through rapid foaming in the heat treatment, while the conventional granules are prepared through rather slow foaming. Therefore, no long heating period is required for performing the process for the preparation of the inorganic foamed granules of the invention. Thus, the process of producing the foamed granules according to the invention is easily carried out. The above mentioned residue foams or expands to an extent of approx. 1.01 to 2.5 times as much as the original granular size by the heat treatment. Im more detail, a granular residue having a granular size of not greater than 2.5 mm expands to an extent of approx. 1.01 to 1.4 times, and a granular residue having a granular size of greater than 2.5 mm expands to an extent of approx. 1.3 2.5 times. Fig. 1 illustrates a relationship between the foaming conditions in terms of deformation ratio which is obtained by measuring the size of the residue and the temperature. This relationship is obtained by heating the GG residue having a mean diameter of 10 mm at a temperature rising from 400 As is clear from Fig. 1, the employed residue foams or expands rapidly as from approx. 730 According to the process for the preparation of the foamed granules according to the invention, if desired, granules having independent voids can be converted into granules having continuous void by controlling the heating conditions such as heating temperature and heating period applied to the granules having independent voids. In more detail, the foamed granules are initially produced in the form of granules having predominently independent voids. Such granules show little water absorption. If the granules having predominently independent voids are further heated, the independent voids are made to associate with each other to give a continuous void which is open to outside. Otherwise, the foamed granules having continuous void can be predominently produced if the heating is performed at a temperature rising rate of 20 The foamed granules having continuous void show high water absorption and are advantageously employed as soil improvers. The heating process for the preparation of the inorganic foamed granules of the invention can be performed in the furnace conventionally employed for the production of volcanic balloon or perlite. For example, a rotary kiln and a furnace for gas stream firing can be employed. It is not clearly understood why the residue produced by partial oxidation of coal favorably foams or expands. The following is an assumption. The residue produced by partial oxidation of coal contains easily expandable or easily foaming materials such as unburnt carbon and sulfides which are converted easily into gas under heating. Thus, these materials are converted into gas under heating to produce a great number of voids. Further, the residue is likely active in comparison with minerals such as volcanic glass, and the above mentioned materials are easily converted into gas even at a relatively low temperature. It is apparent, accordingly, that the inorganic foamed granules of the invention are also employable as extenders for fertilizers, detergents and paints, absorbents, smelting aids, and filtering aids, in addition to the aforementioned lightweight aggregates and soil improvers. The present invention is further described by the following examples and comparison examples.
