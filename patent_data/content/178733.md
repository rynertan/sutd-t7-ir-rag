# DEVICE FOR PREDETERMINING THE ARCING TIME IN A DIRECT CURRENT, LOW MEDIUM VOLTAGE VACUUM SWITCH

## Abstract
In order to increase the electrical life of a direct current, low medium voltage vacuum switch, a device is proposed for predetermining the arcing time during switch opening. The device consists of an optical sensor, in particular of optical fibre type, able to determine the instant of contact separation, and to provide by way of a delay circuit the enabling command for discharging a capacitor bank which causes the current to pass through zero.
