## Description
This invention relates to a method for producing a separating agent useful for separating and refining any desired component out of a mixed solution containing various components, and also to such a novel separating agent obtained by such a production method. More particularly, the invention is concerned with a separating agent suitable for separating and refining a substance of a relatively high molecular weight such as protein, enzymes, saccharides, antibiotics, and other substances related to living organisms, and a method for producing such a separating agent. It is to be noted that the term separating agent or separator as used throughout the present specification is meant by a broad concept of a substance which is employed in the separating operations such as, for example, ion exchanged chromatography, gel permeation chromatography, and so on, and which is usually called an adsorbent or chromatographic carrier. As the organic type separator for use in the separation and the refinement of the biological body related substances, attention has so far been paid to those separators composed of dextran or agarose gel as the base material, particularly in the field of the separating operation with the affinity chromatographic method as the principal expedient for the operation. However, the polysaccharide type separator such as the above mentioned agarose gel has its own disadvantage such that its mechanical strength is inadequate, on account of which the separator is likely to be crushed within a separation column, even in any separation mode such as gel permeation chromatography, adsorptive separation, and so forth, to result in increase in the pressure loss of a circulating feed liquid. Such a disadvantage becomes eminent particularly in a continuous operation over a long period of time in a large scaled industrial separating process. In view of the above described disadvantages inherent in the heretofore known separator, it is the primary object of the present invention to provide an improved method of production of a separating agent having high mechanical strength, and suitable for separation of biological body related substances. It is the secondary object of the present invention to provide a novel separating agent free from the above described disadvantages. It is still other object of the present invention to provide a novel separating agent adapted to various separation modes. According to the present invention, the above mentioned objects can be attained by a method for producing a separating agent having a fluoroalkyl containing group and a hydrophilic group, the method comprising steps of obtaining porous cross linked copolymer particles by suspension polymerization of a cross linking component consisting of alkylene di meth acrylate and or glycerine poly meth acrylate and a principal chain component consisting of ester and or ether having a polymerizable vinyl group or isopropenyl group and a functional group and subsequently chemically modifying the functional group in the porous cross linked copolymer with a compound containing fluorine or both compound containing fluorine and compound containing a hydrophilic group. The objects of the present invention can be further attained by the porous cross linked copolymer particles having a particular chemical structure obtained by the above mentioned method. Various ways of carrying out the present invention are described in detail hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings which are the graphical representations showing various properties of the separator obtained by the production examples of the present invention and that obtained by the comparative production example. In the drawings The method for the production of the separating agent according to the present invention comprises steps of first obtaining porous cross linked copolymer particles by suspension polymerization of a monomeric substance of a particular component having a functional group, and then chemically modifying the functional group in the copolymer to introduce a fluoroalkyl containing group and a hydrophilic group into it. The monomeric substance to be used for the method of the present invention is a cross linking component consisting of alkylene di meth acrylate and or glycerine poly meth acrylate and a principal chain component consisting of an ester and or ether having a polymerizable vinyl group or isopropenyl group and a functional group. As the alkylene di meth acrylate, there may preferably used an ester of alkylene glycol containing 2 to 3 carbon or polyalkylene glycol having a degree of polymerization of 4 or below and acrylic acid or methacrylic acid. Particular examples of such alkylene di meth acrylate are ethylene glycol diacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, propylene glycol diacrylate, propylene glycol dimethacrylate, polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate, polypropylene glycol dimethacrylate, and so on. Of these, ethylene glycol di meth acrylate is typically used. As the glycerine poly meth acrylate, there may be exemplified glycerine triacrylate, glycerine dimethacrylate, and so forth. There is no particular limitation to the esters or ethers having a polymerizable vinyl group or isopropenyl group as well as a functional group, provided that the compounds are capable of introducing the fluoroalkyl containing group and the hydrophilic group into the functional group of the copolymer by their reaction with a chemical modifier which will be mentioned later. Usually, those compounds containing an epoxy group and a hydroxyl group as the functional groups are used. For examples, there may be used such compounds selected from glycidyl ester of carboxylic acid preferably containing 3 to 12 carbcn atoms having one polymerizable vinyl group or isopropenyl group, hydroxy alkyl ester of such carboxylic acid, and alkenyl glycidyl ether containing preferably 3 to 12 carbon atoms having one polymerizable vinyl group or isopropenyl group. Particular examples of such compounds are glycidyl meth acrylate, allyl glycidyl ether, 2 hydroxy ethyl meth acrylate, and polyethyleneglycol monomethacrylate. In the method of producing the separating agent according to the present invention, there is, first of all, manufactured porous cross linked copolymer particles by suspension polymerization of the above described cross linking component and the principal chain component. A ratio of the cross linking component to be used is selected from a range of from 1 to 50 by weight, or preferably from 5 to 30 by weight with respect to the total composition. The suspension polymerization is carried out in accordance with the known method, in which the oil in water type polymerization is effected in the presence of an organic diluent, a polymerization initiator, and so on. There is no particular limitation to the organic diluent to be used as the pore producing agent, provided that it is inert to the above mentioned functional group such as a glycidyl group, a hydroxyl group, and so on. Usually, there may be used benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, chlorobenzene, n octane, dichloroethane, cyclohexyl, n octyl alcohol, n dodecyl alcohol, dibutyl ether, diamyl ether, propyl acetate, butyl acetate, cyclohexanone, methyl isobutyl ketone, and so forth. These organic diluents may be used singly or in combination. Such a diluent is usually used in a quantity of from 0.05 to 3 parts by weight with respect to the total monomeric components. As a polymerization initiator, there may be used dibenzoyl peroxide, diuraloyl peroxide, azo bis isobutyronitrile, and so on. Such a polymerization initiator is usually used in a concentration ranging from 0.01 to 10 by weight. Upon completion of the suspension polymerization, the polymer is subjected to separation by filtration and washing, after which it is recovered as the porous cross linked copolymer having in its side chain the functional group. The porosity and average particle diameter of the porous cross linked copolymer particles may be selected from a wide range of such parameters. Usually, the porosity of such copolymer particles ranges from 0.1 to 3 ml g, or preferably from 0.3 to 2.0 ml g on the dry basis, and the average particle diameter is in a range of from 1 to 2000 µm, preferably from 10 to 200 µm also on the dry basis. In the subsequent step of the production method according to the present invention, the functional group of the thus obtained porous cross linked copolymer particles is chemically modified with a fluorine containing compound or with both fluorine containing compound and hydrophilic group containing compound to introduce into it a fluoroalkyl containing group and the hydrophilic group, which is the outstanding characteristic of the present invention. In the present invention, the chemical modification is considered to be sufficiently effected, if the functional group contained in the copolymer reacts with the chemical modifier to be mentioned later to result in introduction into the copolymer of fluorine and or the hydrophilic group, hence it is not always required that the chemical modifier per se contains a sufficient number of hydrophilic groups. For instance, as will be described hereinafter, in case 2 hydroxy ethyl meth acrylate containing a hydroxyl group is used as the principal chain component of the copolymer, since the copolymer itself already contains the hydrophilic hydroxyl group, it may suffice that a part of the functional group in the copolymer be substituted by fluorine. In this case, therefore, a compound containing fluorine may be used as the chemical modifier. Although, in the present invention, the chemical modification is effected on the porous cross linked copolymer particles, the modification reaction per se is not different at all from the reaction on any low molecular weight organic compounds. Accordingly, the chemical modification intended in the present invention can be done by use of a well known reaction appropriately selected depending on the type of the functional group, hence there is no particular limitation to it. Examples of the typical chemical modification to the functional group are as follows. Further, in the case of the functional group being the epoxy group, the above mentioned chemical modification may be possibly effected on the total amount of the epoxy groups. On the other hand, however, it is preferable that such chemical modification reaction be carried out partially, and subsequently, the hydrophilic groups be introduced into the remainder of the epoxy groups with a compound which does not contain fluorine, but contains a hydrophilic group alone. According to such two stage treating method for the chemical modification, the ratio of introduction of the fluoroalkyl group and the hydrophilic group can be easily adjusted, whereby there can be readily obtained the porous cross linked copolymer particles, on the surface of which both hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties are imparted at an appropriate ratio. As the chemical modifiers to be used at the second stage reaction of the two stage chemical modification treatment, where the hydrophilic group is to be introduced, there may be exemplified the following water, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, glycerine, pentaerythritol, polyvinyl alcohol, and other polyhydric alcohols glycidol and other epoxy group containing alcohols and glucose, cyclodextrin, maltose, and other saccharides. Further, as the catalysts, there may suitably be used sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, perchloric acid, sodium hydroxide, and so forth. In the chemical modification reaction, use of a solvent does not constitute an essential requirement. However, from the standpoint of uniformity in the reaction and the operational convenience thereof, coexistence of a solvent is preferable. The solvent to be used for this purpose should be selected from such substances that dissolve the fluorine containing compounds and are also inert to the cross linked copolymer having the functional groups as well as to the catalysts. Further, when a Lewis acid and metallic sodium are used as the catalyst, they must be used inevitably in the perfectly dried state. As such solvents, there may preferably be used ethers and hydrocarbons. Specific examples of such solvents are dioxane, trioxane, tetrahydrofuran, benzene, toluene, xylene, dimethyl sulfoxide, and so forth. The reaction temperature is usually 170 C or below, or more preferably in a range of from 0 to 120 C or so, taking into consideration of the heat resisting temperature of the cross linked copolymer. The reaction time in any of the reactions is within 10 hours, which is generally sufficient, though it depends on the class of the catalyst used. In the chemical modification according to the present invention, the optimum range of the ratio of fluorine to be introduced into the cross linked copolymer is appropriately selected by the manner of using the separator such as the adsorbing agent, chromatographic carrier, and so on the separation mode or the kind of the component to be separated. In general, however, the fluorine content in the cross linked copolymer is in a range of from 1 to 60 by weight. Also, there is no particular limitation to the ratio of the hydrophilic group. However, in the case of introducing the hydrophilic group into the functional group in the side chain of the cross linked copolymer, it usually ranges from 10 to 90 mol of the functional group. The separating agent according to the present invention is manufactured by the above described chemical modification, and is used in various separation modes, although the characteristic of the separator required of these various separation modes differs from mode to mode. When the separator is used as the gel permeation chromatographic carrier, it is required to have less non specific adsorption phenomenon with the biological body related substances. That is to say, it has been said that the interaction between protein, etc. and the base body of the separator is classified into the hydrophobic interaction, the hydrogen bonding, and the electrostatic interaction. When such interaction is considerable, there takes place such a phenomenon that, the separability of the substances is varied by the interaction other than the molecular size, even in the gel permeation chromatography which is intended to separate one substance from the other due to a difference in their molecular sizes, with a consequential problem such that no expected separability is obtainable. The non peculiar adsorption phenomenon has something to do with selectivity at the time of separating the biological body related substances one another. As a result of such a phenomenon, however, neither sufficient separating function nor long serviceable life can be expected with the above mentioned conventional separating agent. Such a problem has not yet actually been solved to a satisfactory degree even in the conventionally known polysaccharide type separator as mentioned in the foregoing. In accordance with the method according to the present invention, it is possible to obtain a separating agent, which exhibits less non peculiar phenomenon, hence particularly suitable as the gel permeation chromatographic carrier, by use of a fluorine containing chemical modifier capable of introducing the straight chain fluoroalkyl group into a porous cross linked copolymer particles, and by controlling the fluorine content in the porous cross linked copolymer particles to a range of from 1 to 20 by weight. This control of the fluorine content can be easily attained by the afore described two stage chemical modification treatment, wherein it is preferable that fluorine is introduced into the copolymer by the chemical modification of from 10 to 70 mol , or preferably from 20 to 50 mol , of the functional group in the copolymer at the first stage reaction, and then the remainder of the functional group is substituted by the hydrophilic group at the second stage reaction. On the other hand, when the separator is used as the adsorbing agent, it is required to have a large adsorptibility. According to the method of the present invention, there can be obtained a separating agent having high adsorptibility by use of a fluorine containing chemical modifier capable of introducing a branched chain fluoroalkyl group into the porous cross linked copolymer particles, and by controlling the fluorine content in the porous cross linked copolymer particles to a range of from 10 to 60 by weight. The separating agent to be obtained by the above described method according to the present invention has itself a novel chemical structure. That is to say, it consists essentially of the cross linking component of alkylene di meth acrylate and or glycerine poly meth acrylate the fluoroalkyl containing ester component represented by the following general formulae 1 and or 2 and the glycerine derivative ester component and or polyethylene glycol ester component represented by the following general formulae 3 and or 4 , the porosity of which is in a range of from 0.1 to 3 ml g, or preferably from 0.3 to 2.0 ml g, on the dry basis, and the average particle diameter of which is in a range of from 1 to 2000 µm, or preferably from 10 to 200 µm. Particularly preferable copolymers out of various porous cross linked copolymers represented by the foregoing general formulae are those three kinds I , II and III , as follows. I Porous cross linked copolymer particles consisting essentially of three structural units represented by the following general formulae a , b and c The above mentioned porous cross linked copolymer particles I contains the straight chain fluoroalkyl group, the fluorine content in the copolymer ranging from 1 to 20 by weight. This copolymer particles are suitable as the gel permeation filtration chromatographic carrier. On the other hand, the porous cross linked copolymer particles containing the branched chain fluoroalkyl group with the fluorine content therein ranging from 10 to 60 by weight is suitable as the adsorptive separator. II Porous cross linked copolymer particles consisting essentially of three structural units represented by the following general formulae a , b and c In the above described porous cross linked copolymers II and III , the one containing fluorine in a range of from 1 to 20 by weight is particularly suited as the separator for the gel permeation chromatography. While the separating agent according to the present invention is adopted for the industrial separation process of protein and various other biological body related substances, it may, of course, be useful as the means for analysis. Although the actual separation method depends on the separation mode in either of the above mentioned cases, it can be practiced in accordance with the specific method to be adopted in every field. For instance, in the case of the gel permeation chromatography, a buffer liquid same as an eluent is circulated in a separation column filled with the separating agent to bring them into equilibrium, and then a sample with a component to be separated having been dissolved therein is charged in the separation column, after which the eluent is circulated at a constant flow rate to elute the component to be separated. Since the separating agent according to the present invention is extremely small in its swelling and contraction, various sorts of aqueous solutions having different ionic strength and pH values or various kinds of organic solvents can possibly be used as the eluent, which advantageously affords the separating agent a wide range of its application. Incidentally, the maximum displacement limit molecular weight of the chromatographic carrier consisting of the separating agent according to the present invention is approximately 2,000,000. On the other hand, in the case of the adsorptive separation, the component for separation as adsorbed in the above mentioned column filled with the separator is separated by elution in an appropriate expedient. As the method for elution, there may be employed a method of decreasing the ionic strength of the eluent, or a method of using an eluent, in which an organic solvent or a surfactant has been dissolved, or others. In the following, the present invention will be explained in more detail with reference to practical production examples. Into a four necked flask of 1 liter capacity equipped with a condensing tube, a thermometer and an agitator, 450 ml of ion exchanged water, 15 g of sodium chloride, and 150 ml of 2 aqueous solution of polyvinyl alcohol were added and agitated. To this mixture, there was further added a mixture solution consisting of 20 g of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 65 g of glycidyl methacrylate, 50 g of n octanol, 50 g of cyclohexanol, and 1.0 g of benzoyl peroxide as the polymerization initiator. Then, the polymerization reaction was carried out under agitation at a temperature of 90 C for nine hours to obtain a copolymer. This polymeric substance was sufficiently washed with water, methanol, and water, in the order as mentioned. The rate of yield of the polymer, after its drying, was 97.5 , and its average particle diameter was 150 µm. The thus obtained resin assumed white, porous spherulite with porosity of 0.97 ml g R. Subsequently, 60 ml of 1,4 dioxane and 15.0 g of the above mentioned polymer were charged into a four necked flask of a 300 ml capacity under the current of nitrogen gas N₂ , and mixed under agitation at 50 C for 20 minutes. Into this mixture, there were added 5 g of 2,2,2 trifluoroethanol and 0.15 g of metallic sodium, and reaction was carried out at 80 C for two hours. Thereafter, the temperature of the reaction solution was lowered to 50 C, into which 10 g of glycerol and 0.5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid were added to be agitated for one hour at 50 C, thereby adding glycerol to the remainder of the functional group in the side chain. As the result, there was obtained a fluorine containing polymer. The elementary analysis of the fluorine containing polymer indicated the following values 52.8 carbon, 6.4 hydrogen, and 7.5 fluorine. Also, each of the mol fraction of the cross linking component a , the principal chain component containing fluoroalkyl groups b , and the hydrophilic principal chain component containing no fluoroalkyl group c was 0.18, 0.24 and 0.58, respectively. Into a glass column having an inner diameter of 10 mm equipped with a jacket , 40 ml of the separating agent obtained in the Production Example 1 with its particle size having been regulated to a range of from 74 to 208 microns. The layer thickness of the separator was 50 cm. The column was maintained at a temperature of 25 C with circulating water, and a buffer solution of 0.05 mol l phosphoric acid pH value of 7.0 was caused to flow at a constant flow rate from the top of the column. When the charged layer of the separating agent became stabilized and the indicator needle of a pressure gauge mounted on the top part of the column became steady, the graduation of the pressure gauge was read. From this read value, there was subtracted a value obtained by reading of the pressure gauge when the exactly same operations as mentioned above were carried out in the state of the glass column having been empty, i.e., not having been filled with the separating agent, thereby finding out the pressure loss Δp unit of measurement being kg cm³ 50 cm bed . When the flow rate LV linear velocity, unit of measurement m hr. was varied to measure the pressure loss Δp , there were obtained the results as shown by a rectilinear line 1 in Figure 1. It will be seen from this graphical representation that, within the range of the measured flow rate LV 7 m hr or less , there was established a linear relationship between the pressure loss Δp and the flow rate LV in the case of using the separating agent according to the present invention, hence there could be observed neither deformation nor crushing of the carrier particles, even if the liquid circulation was done at a high flow rate of LV 7 m hr. For the sake of comparison, the exactly same operations as mentioned above were conducted with the exception that cross linking agarose gel was used in place of the separating agent obtained from Production Example 1 above, from which the relationship between the pressure loss Δp and the flow rate LV was found. The results are as shown by a curve 2 in Figure 1. In the case of using the cross linking agarose gel, the pressure loss Δp began to rise up abruptly from about a point where the flow rate LV exceeds 1 m hr., and, with the flow rate LV of 2.5 m hr. or higher, the liquid circulation became impossible. Into a four necked flask of 300 ml capacity, 60 ml of 1,4 dioxane and 15.0 g of the same polymer as obtained form Production Example 1 above were charged under the current of nitrogen gas N₂ , and the batch was agitated at 50 C for 20 minutes. Thereafter, 4.0 g of 2,2,3,3,4,4,4 heptafluoro 1 butanol and 0.15 g of metallic sodium were added to this mixture solution to carry out the reaction at 80 C for two hours. After this, the temperature of the mixture solution was lowered to 50 C, and 80 ml of 5 aqueous solution of sulfuric acid was added to this mixture solution to hydrolyse the remainder of the functional group in the side chain. As the result, there was obtained a fluorine containing polymer of the following elementary analytical values 48.0 carbon, 5.2 hydrogen, and 13.5 fluorine. Also, the mol fraction of each of the cross linking component a , the principal chain component containing fluoroalkyl groups b , and the hydrophilic principal chain component containing no fluoroalkyl group c was 0.18, 0.25 and 0.57, respectively. The exactly same operations as in Production Example 1 above were conducted with the exception that glucose was used in place of glycerol in the Production Example 1, as the hydrophilic compound. The elementary analysis of the resulted fluorine containing polymer was as follows 50.01 carbon, 6.67 hydrogen, and 3.41 fluorine a 0.18, b 0.16, c 0.66 . Into a four necked flask of 300 ml capacity, there were charged 60 ml of 1,4 dioxane and 14.8 g of the same polymer as obtained from Production Example 1 above under the nitrogen gas N₂ current, and the batch was agitated at 50 C for 20 minutes. To this mixture solution, 4.0 g of 2,2,3,3,4,4,4 heptafluorobutanol and 0.15 g of metallic sodium were added, and the reaction was conducted at 80 C for two hours. After completion of the reaction, dioxane solution was removed and the residual polymer was washed on filter paper with dry dioxane. The thus washed polymer was again returned into the flask with further addition of 50 ml of dioxane and 10 g of glycerol, to which 5 ml of dioxane solution of 10 sulfuric acid was slowly dropped. The reaction was continued for four hours at 50 C, during which glycerol was introduced into the residual epoxy group, thereby obtaining fluorine containing polymer having the following elementary analytical values 52.37 carbon, 6.70 hydrogen, and 5.67 fluorine a 0.18, b 0.52, c 0.48 . Into a four necked flask of 300 ml capacity, there were charged 60 ml of dry 1,4 dioxane and 14.9 g of the same polymer as obtained from Production Example 1 above under the nitrogen gas N₂ current, and the batch was agitated for 20 minutes at a temperature of 50 C. To this mixture solution, 4.7 g of 2,2,2 trifluoroethanol and 40.12 g of metallic sodium were added, and the reaction was carried out for two hours at 80 C. After completion of the reaction, dioxane solution was removed and the residual polymer was dried on filter paper and then washed with dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO solution. Thereafter, the polymer was returned to the flask with addition of 70 ml of DMSO and 8.8 g of pentaerythritol, to which 5 ml of dioxane solution of 10 sulfuric acid was slowly dropped. The reaction was then continued for four hours at 50 C, during which glycerol was introduced into the residual epoxy group. As the result, there was obtained fluorine containing polymer of the following elementary analytical values 50.60 carbon, 6.27 hydrogen, and 7.84 fluorine a 0.18, b 0.35, c 0.47 .

The resulted fluorine containing polymer had the following elementary analytical values 51.62 carbon, 6.28 hydrogen, and 7.22 fluorine a 0.18, b 0.25, and c 0.57 . The exactly same operations as in Production Example 5 above were conducted with the exception that use was made of 2,2,3,3,4,4,4 heptafluorobutanol as the fluoroalkyl group containing compound and β cyclodextrin as the hydrophilic compound. The resulted fluorine containing polymer had the following elementary analytical values 50.53 carbon, 6.50 hydrogen, and 3.32 fluorine a 0.18, b 0.22, and c 0.60 . Into a four necked flask, there were charged 60 ml of 1,4 dioxane and 15.0 g of the same polymer as obtained from Production Example 1 above, and the batch was agitated for 20 minutes at 50 C. To this mixture solution, 7 ml of dioxane solution, into which 2.1 g of perfluorolactic acid had been dissolved, was dropped, and the reaction was continued for two hours at 80 C. After completion of the reaction, dioxane solution was removed and the residual polymer was returned to the flask with addition of 50 ml of 10 aqueous solution of sulfuric acid, and the mixture was agitated for five hours at 50 C. After completion of the reaction, the polymer was sufficiently washed with water to thereby obtain fluorine containing polymer. The thus obtained fluorine containing polymer had the following elementary analytical values 52.15 carbon, 6.03 hydrogen, and 5.32 fluorine a 0.18, b 0.07, c 0.75 . Further, the infrared ray absorption spectrum derived from the fluoroalkyl containing group in the polymer was 1785 cm ¹ . The exactly same procedures as in Production Example 8 above were followed with the exception that use was made of glycerol in place of water as the hydrophilic compound in Production Example 8. The resulted fluorine containing polymer had the following elementary analytical values 51.6 carbon, 6.6 hydrogen, and 6.9 fluorine a 0.18, b 0.13, and c 0.69 . Further, the infrared ray absorption spectrum of the polymer due to the fluoroalkyl containing group therein was 1785 cm ¹ . Into a four necked flask of 300 ml capacity equipped with a condensing tube, a thermometer, an agitator, and an N₂ gas feed tube, there were charged 16.81 g of sodium chloride, 368 ml of ion exchanged water, and 200 ml of 2 aqueous solution of polyvinyl alcohol, and the batch was agitated. To this mixture solution, there was further added a mixture solution consisting of 64.01 g of glycidyl methacrylate, 16.03 g of triethylene glycol dimethyacrylate, 68.75 g of toluene, and 1.227 g of benzoyl peroxide as the polymerization initiator. The polymerization reaction was conducted for nine hours at 85 C in the nitrogen atmosphere to obtain a copolymer. The resulted polymer was sufficiently washed for three times with water and methanol in the order as mentioned. When dried, there was obtained white porous spherulitic resin at a rate of polymerization of 92 and with porosity of 0.76 ml g. Subsequently, 12.852 g of the thus obtained polymer, 60 ml of 1,4 dioxane distilled solvent was used after drying with metallic sodium , 290 mg of metallic sodium, and 4.373 g of 2,2,2 trifluoroethanol were charged into a four necked flask of 200 ml capacity, and the reaction was continued for 2.5 hours at 90 C. After completion of the reaction, dioxane solution was removed, and the residual polymer was washed with dry dioxane. This polymer was returned to the flask with addition of 70 ml of dioxane solution, into which 6.234 g of glycerol had been dissolved. To this mixture, 5.0 ml of dioxane solution containing 0.70 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid was dropped, and the reaction was conducted for five hours at 50 C.

Then, the reaction was continued for nine hours at 85 C in the nitrogen atmosphere, from which a copolymer was obtained. The resulted polymer was sufficiently washed for three times with water and methanol in the order as mentioned. Upon drying, there was obtained white porous spherulitic resin at a rate of polymerization of 94.7 and with porosity of 0.67 ml g. Subsequently, 20.3 g of the thus obtained polymer in its dried condition, 95 ml of 1,4 dioxane, and 3.01 g of 2,2,2 trifluoroethanol were charged into a four necked flask of 200 ml capacity in the nitrogen atmosphere, and the batch was agitated for 20 minutes at a temperature of 50 C.
