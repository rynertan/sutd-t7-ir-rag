# HEATING BOILER WITH HIGH AUTONOMY OF FEEDING WITH SOLID FUEL

## Abstract
The boiler is constituted by a combustion chamber 20 120 with oblique side walls 2, 4 102, 104 adapted to cause the solid fuel to descend automatically by gravity towards a lower grid 5, 105 where combustion takes place. The fuel is introduced through two capacious upper apertures 7, 8 107, 108 provided with smokeproof covers. The fluid to be fed to the heating bodies is heated in a central cylindrical body 14, 114 with flue pipes. The central cylindrical body 14 114 can be made either in a version for feeding with solid fuel only or in a version for mixed feeding, in which case the boiler is provided with appropriate supports for a conventional burner 17 . The main advantage of the boiler is its great autonomy of feeding with solid fuel which is introduced thereinto in considerable amounts if desired, in the form of large economical pieces of wood logs which, however, are burned gradually in time.
