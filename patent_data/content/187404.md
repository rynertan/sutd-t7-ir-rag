# Ink for an ink jet printing device and method of preparing the ink.

## Abstract
The ink is kept in circulation between reservoirs and nozzles by a common pump which acts by a series of actuating elements on the discharge ducts for the inks in the reservoirs. The reservoirs may contain inks of different colours to permit printing in different colours of polychrome facsimile printing by additive or substractive synthesis of the colours. The ink is conductive and is kept at earth potential, while electrodes disposed outside the corresponding nozzles are energized selectively to produce sprays of particles of ink from the nozzles. The ink contains a mixture of a dye of direct or solvent or acid type with a solution of water, electrolytic compounds, moistening agents, thickeners, preserving agents and anti foaming agent. The ink is prepared by mixing the compounds under agitation, then mixing in the dye until a predetermined acidity is obtained and finally filtering it and sealing it in the pack in the absence of air.
