# Wall panel base construction.

## Abstract
A wall panel base construction includes a foot 20 , a wall panel supporting assembly 10 , and a plurality of oppositely threaded members 41 extending between the foot and the supporting assembly. The lower portion 141b of each threaded member is secured within a block 43 , which is in turn pivotally received in a clip or socket 44 supported on the foot to prevent the threaded members from jamming during height adjustment. The blocks 43 are also laterally shiftable with respect to the foot to further accommodate movement of the threaded member during height adjustment. The upper end of the threaded member 41 includes a chuck means 41c for receiving a rotatable driving tool and the panel supporting assembly 10 defines an aperture 11f axially aligned with the threaded member, whereby the chuck can be freely accessed to facilitate rotation of the member.
