The carboxylic acid ester or amide is preferably an oligo or poly ester comprising from 2 to 100 units of one or more hydroxycarboxylic acid monomers. The term carboxymethyl, that is a group of the formula CH2COO COO , does not include a carboxymethyl group in which the CH2 group is directly attached to a carbon atom of an unsubstituted hydrocarbon chain containing two or more carbon atoms. A preferred compound in accordance with the present invention conforms to the general formula A O B CO m D I wherein A and D are are groups one of which is or carries the acid group as hereinbefore defined and the other is a convenient terminal group which does not render the compound hydrophilic, B is a hydrocarbon group and m is from 1 to 100. In the compound of Formula I, when D carries the acid group,A is preferably the residue AÚ CO of an esterifiable carboxylic acid of the formula AÚ COOH, in which AÚ is H, a hydrocarbon or a substituted hydrocarbon. Although A1 is conveniently an optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl or polycycloalkyl group containing up to 50, more preferably up to 35, carbon atoms, it can be any convenient monovalent group.In this case D is preferably a polj valent, more preferably di or tri valent, bridging group linking the acid group to the ester chain, AlCO O B CO E , e.g. a group such 2 as D defined below. Where D has a valency greater than 2 it may link two or more acid groups to single ester or two or more esters chain to a single acid group. Where the acid group has more than one valency it may be linked to two or more esters through two bridging groups. In the compound of Formula I, when A carries the acid group,D is preferably the residue of an alcohol, a thiol or a primary or secondary amine, D XH, in which D is an aliphatic or alicyclic group of similar character to A1, and X is O, S or NR in which R is R, alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, or phenyl, in which the alkyl and alkenyl groups contain up to 20 carbon atoms and the cycloalkyl groups from 4 to 8 carbon atoms. In this case A is preferably the acid group itself and where this has more than one valency it may be linked to two or more polyester chains, although A may also be a polyvalent linking group, like D above, linking the acid group to the polyester chain.The hydrocarbon group represented by B, which is preferably an optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl or polycycloalkyl group, preferably contains up to 50, more preferably from 3 to 24, carbon atoms, with at least 3 carbon atoms directly between the 0 and CO groups. Optional substitutents for A D and B include halo, especially chloro, hydroxy, amino, alkoxy and other non ionic species in so far as they do not make the ester amide chain hydrophilic in character. it is preferred that m is from 2 to 75, more preferably 3 to 30, so that the compound of Formula I is an oligo or poly ester.Where m 1 it is preferred that the group represented by A or D which is remote from the acid group contains at least 6 carbon atoms and that the surfactant contains at least 12 carbon atoms and more preferably at least 20 carbon atoms. A first preferred species of the first aspect of the present invention, particularly suitable for use as a surfactant in compositions comprising an oil phase and an aqueous phase, is a compound which comprises. a hydrophobic component and a hydrophilic component covalently bonded together, wherein the hydrophobic component is the residue of an oligomeric or polymeric monocarboxylic acid of the formula EMI3.1 in which A2 is hydrogen or a monovalent hydrocarbon or substituted hydrocarbon group B1 is hydrogen or a monovalent C1 to C24 hydrocarbon group B2 is a divalent C1 to C24 hydrocarbon group n is zero or 1 and p is zero or an integer up to 100, preferably 2 to 20, and wherein the hydrophilic component contains an anionic grouping selected from phosphate, phosphonate, sulphate, sulphonate and carboxymethyl, i.e. the acid group. The acid group in the first preferred species may be in the free acid form or as a salt thereof with a base, for example, ammonia, organic bases such as amines and aminoalcohols, and inorganic bases. The term oil phase and oil used in respect of the first species and compositions based thereon refers to water immiscible, preferably non polar, liquids in general. It is not limited to, though embracing, naturally occurring oils such as hydrocarbons and fatty acid esters. Where the surfactant of Formula II is designed for use in compositions, particularly oil water emulsions, containing non polar organic liquids the compound of Formula II is preferably oil soluble, that is the oil phase of the composition should be better than a theta solvent for the compound. The significance of the expression theta solvent is discussed in Polymer Handbook Ed. Brandrup BR Immergut, Interscience, 1966 at pages IV 163 166. Briefly, this definition implies that in a solution of a polymer in a solvent, a solvent which is better than a theta solvent for the polymer, the polymer exists in a non self associated condition. The definition is usually satisfied by any liquid which would normally be described as a good solvent for the polymer.Considerable variation in the composition of the compound of Formula I, particularly in respect of the nature of the groups A2, B1 and B2, is possible, whilst meeting the requirement that the compound should be oil soluble in the above sense. Generally speaking, the more the oil phase of the composition tends towards a fully aliphatic character, the longer will the hydrocarbon chains of these groups need to be.

Compositions containing the Surfactant The compounds of the first aspect of the invention, hereinafter referred to as surfactants are particularly useful for enhancing the dispersibility of solids in organic media and for stabilising water in oil and oil in water emulsions. i First Composition According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a composition of a solid and a surfactant according to the first aspect of the invention. The surfactant for use in the first composition is preferably a compound in accordance withFormula III or Formula IV. The composition of the second aspect, hereinafter referred to as the first composition , may comprise an intimate mixture of the two components but preferably comprises a coating of the surfactant on finely divided primary particles of the solid which preferably have a mean diameter below 10 microns and more preferably below 5 microns. The composition may be dry, in which case the primary particles may be aggregated, or it may be in the form of a dispersion of the solid in an organic medium, preferably one which is a liquid, or is at least plastic, under normal ambient conditions. The solid may be any material which it is desired to stabilise in a finely divided state in an organic medium. Examples of suitable solids are pigments for solvent inks and paints pigments and fillers for plastics materials dyestuffs, optical brightening agents and textile auxiliaries for solvent dyebaths, inks. and other solvent application systems magnetic solids, especially magnetic metals or alloys and magnetic oxides, for use in the production of magnetic tapes and discs, solids for oil based and invert emulsion drilling muds, dirt and soil particles in dry cleaning fluids and biocides, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals which are applied as dispersions in organic media. The first composition, whether dry or in the form of a dispersion may contain other ingredients, such as resins, binders, fluidising agents, anti sedimentation agents, plasticisers and preservatives. A preferred solid is a pigment from any of the recognised classes of pigments described, for example, in the Third Edition of the Colours Index 1971 and subsequent revisions of, and supplements thereto, under the chapter headed Pigments . Examples 6f inorganic pigments are titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, Prussian blue, cadmium sulphide, iron oxides, vermillion, ultramarine and the chrome pigments5 including chromates, molybdates and mixed chromates and sulphates of lead, zinc, barium, calcium, and mixtures and modifications thereof which are commercially available as greenish yellow to red pigments under the names primrose, lemon, middle, orange, scarlet and red chromes. Examples of organic pigments are those from the azo, disazo, condensed azo, thioindigo, indanthrone, isoindanthrone, anthraquinone, anthanthrone, isodibenzanthrone, triphendiosazine, phthalocyanine, especially copper phthalocyanine and its nuclear halogenated derivatives, and quinacridone series and also lakes of acid, basic and mordant dyes. Carbon black, although strictly inorganic5 behaves more like an organic pigment in non aqueous dispersions. Preferred organic pigments are phthalocyanines, and especially copper phthalocyanines, monoazos, disazos, indanthrones, anthanthrones, quinacridones and carbon blacks. where the solid is a pigment the first composition is compatible with the fluidising agents disclosed in UK PatentSpecifications Nos 1508576 and 2108143. The fluidising.agent described in UK 1508576 is a substituted ammonium salt of a coloured acid wherein there are from 19 to 60 carbon atoms in at least 3 chains attached to the N atom of the substituted ammonium ion. The fluidising agent described in UK 2108143 is a water insoluble disazo compound comprising a central divalent group free from acidic and other ionic substituents linked, through azo groups, to two monovalent end groups, one end group being free from acidic and other ionic substituents and the other carrying a single substituted ammonium salt group. Such fluidising agents are useful for enhancing the fluidity of the dispersion form of the first composition. Examples of magnetic solids include gamma Fe203, cobÅalt doped gamma Fe203, magnetize, Cr02, Ferrites and particulate iron, cobalt and nickel, and alloys thereof. Examples of agrochemicals include the fungicides flutriafen, carbendazim, chlorothalonil and mancozeb. The organic medium may be any organic medium in which it is desired to disperse the solid and with which the surfactant is compatible and at least partially soluble. It is preferably liquid, or at least plastic, at normal ambient temperatures. Examples of suitable media are hydrocarbons and chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as aliphatic petroleum fractions, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, perchloroethylene, benzene, toluene, xylene and chlorobenzene, alcohols such as n butanol, ethers such a di alkylethers and tetrahydrofuran, ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone, methyl i butyl ketone and cyclohexanone and esters such as butyl acetate and 2 ethoxyethyl acetate. Mixtures of these liquids may be used and, in general, the organic liquid or mixture is selected to meet the requirements of the end use to which the composition will be put. The first composition may be prepared by mixing the components or the surfactant may be added to the solid during the preparation of the latter, preferably during tha later or finishing stages of preparation. The first composition may also be prepared by subjecting a mixture of the solid, the surfactant, preferably in the organic medium to a grinding operation sufficient to reduce the particle size of the solid to below 10 microns. If the composition includes a liquid organic medium, this may be subsequently removed, e.g. by evaporation, if the composition is required in a dry form. The first composition preferably contains from 1 to 100 by weight of the dispersing agent, based on the weight of the solid, but more preferably contains from 1 to 30 , on the same basis. In the dispersion form, the first composition preferably contains from 10 to 90 by weight of the solid the precise quantity depending on the nature of the solid and the relative densities of the solid and liquid. For example, dispersions of organic pigments preferably contain from 15Z to 60X by weight of pigment whereas dispersions of an inorganic pigments preferably contain from 40 to 90 of the pigment, based on the total weight of the composition. ii Second and Third Compositions According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a composition of a surfactant, in accordance with the first aspect of the invention, and a water mmiscible organic liquid, hereinafter referred to as the second composition . The second composition may comprise the organic liquid and the surfactant alone or it may be converted to a third composition comprising a water inoil or oil in water emulsion of the organic liquid and an aqueous medium stabilised with the surfactant. Such an emulsion forms a fourth aspect of the present invention. Water immiscible organic liquids which may be satisfactorily emulsified in water with the aid of these surfactants include fatty glycerides, mineral oils, hydrocarbon fuel oils and other liquid hydrocarbons, synthetic lubricants such as the tetra pelargonate ester of pentaerythritol, bitumens, waxes and polyolefins such as poly isobutylene . The resulting emulsions are useful, inter alia as hydraulic fluids, cutting oils and other metal working fluids. A preferred surfactant for use in the second composition is a compound in accordance with Formula II. In producing the emulsions, it is generally preferred to add the surfactant to the oil phase before the latter is contacted with the aqueous phase. in cases where it is desired to neutralise the free acidic groups in the surfactant, the base may be introduced before, during or after the blending of the surfactant with the oil phase. The surfactants of the invention, especially those ofFormula II, are advantageous in that they can tolerate water phases which are high in dissolved inorganic content, for example naturally hard waters or brines containing up to saturation levels of salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride or calcium chloride.Those surfactants in which the anionic grouping is derived from phosphoric acid have particularly good tolerance towards the presence of polyvalent cations such as Ca 2 A further advantage is that the surfactants do not lose their efficacy at higher temperatures they perform satisfactorily at temperatures of up to 100 C or higher. The proportion of surfactantwhich is required in a particular oil water system may vary widely according to the nature of the two phases, but in most instances it will lie in the range 0.1 to 25 by weight, based on the disperse phase of the emulsion.Preparation of Surfactants The surfactants of the first aspect of the invention may be prepared by reaction between a polyester having a terminal carboxylic acid and or hydroxy group and a compound having group reactive therewith and carrying a terminal acid group. Alternatively the polyester may be reacted directly with a precursor of the acid group or with a bifunctional compound which is subsequently reacted with a precursor of the acid group. Preferred polyesters are those derived from hydroxycarboxylic acids or lactones, such as 12 hydroxystearic acid and E caprolactone. in the above processes, a monomeric precursor of the polyester may be used in place of the prepared polyester, whereby the polyester is formed in situ and directly converted into the surfactant. Suitable precursors of the polyester are hydroxycarboxylic acids and lactones. Suitable compounds containing the acid group are alpha amino or alpha hydroxy alkane carboxylic acids, such as glycine and glycollic acid and amino and hydroxy organic sulphonie or posphonic acids, such as aminoethane sulphonic acid, suitable precursors of the acid group are phosphorus pentoxide and sulphonyl chloride and suitable bifunctional compounds, which can form a linking group between the polyester and the acid group, are polyamines, polyols and hydroxyamines. i Surfactant of First Preferred Species The oil soluble monocarboxylic acid of Formula II, the residue of which forms the hydrophobic component of the first preferred species of the first aspect of the invention, maybe prepared by the interesterification of one or more monohydroxy monocarboxylic acids together with a monocarboxylic acid free from hydroxyl groups which acts as a chain terminator. The hydrocarbon chains Aê, B1 and Bê may be linear or branched. Aê is preferably an alkyl group containing up to 25 carbon atoms, for example a straight chain C17H35 group derived from stearic acid. B1 is preferably a straight chain alkyl group, and Bê is preferably a straight chain alkylene group for example, the unit containing B and B2 may be derived from 12 hydroxy stearic acid. The hydroxyl group in the monohydroxymonocarboxylic acid, and the carboxyl group in either carboxylic acid, may be primary, secondary or tertiary in character. Suitable hydroxycarboxylic acids for use in the first stage include glycollic acid, lactic acid, hydracrylic acid, 6 hydroxycaproic acid, ricinoleic acid and, more especially 12 hydroxystearic acid. The non hydroxylic carboxylic acid which acts as a chain terminator, and hence as a means of regulating the molecular weight of the complex monocarboxylic acid, may be, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, caproic acid, stearic acid or an acid derived from a naturally occurring oil, such as tall oil fatty acid.Commercial quantities of 12 bydroxystearic acid normally contain up to 15 of stearic acid, and other non hydroxy acids as impurities and can conveniently be used without further admixture to produce a polymer of molecular weight about 1500 2000. where the non hydroxylic monocarboxylic acid is separately introduced, the proportion which is required in order to produce a polymer or oligomer of a given molecular weight can be determined either by simple experiment or by calculation. The interesterification of the monohydroxymonocarboxylic acid and the non hydroxylic monocarboxylic acid may be effected by heating the starting materials in a suitable hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene or xylene, which is able to form an azeotrope with the water produced in the esterification reaction The reaction is preferably carried out in an inert atmosphere, e.g. of nitrogen, at a temperature of up to 2500C, conveniently at the refluxing temperature of the solvent. where the hydroxyl group is secondary or tertiary the temperature employed should not be so high as to lead to dehydration of the acid molecule.Catalysts for the esterification, such as p toluene sulphuric acid, zinc acetate, zirconium naphthenate or tetrabutyl titanate, may be included, with the object of either increasing the rate of reaction at a given temperature or of reducing the temperature required for a given rate of reaction. The hydrophobic component mentioned above may conveniently be linked to the hydrophilic component by reacting the compound ofFormula II with one or more appropriate co reactants capable of reacting with the free carboxyl group therein. The carboxyl group reacts readily with compounds containing, for example, hydroxyl or amino groups and therefore one way in which the surfactants of the invention may be made is by reacting the compound of Formula II with a compound which has in the molecule at least one hydroxyl or amino group and also at least one acid group. Examples of such compounds, where the acid group present in the hydrophilic component of the surfactant is a carboxyl group, include amino acids such as glycine and short chain hydroxy acids such as glycollic acid or lactic acid. Another way in which the surfactants may be produced is by an indirect, two stage process in which the compound of Formula II is reacted with a linking compound containing at least one reaction group such as a hydroxyl or amino group and at least one other reactive group, and the intermediate product so obtained is then reacted with a compound containing the acid group and a group capable of combining with the other reactive group in the linking compound.Suitable linking compounds include polyols, polyamines and hydroxyamines, as examples of which there may be mentioned ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, ethylene diamine, trimethylene diamine, hexamethylene diamine, diethylene triamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, dipropanolamine and tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane. Hydroxyamines are appropriate linking compounds since, because of the difference in reactivity of the hydroxyl and amino groups, it is easier to avoid the formation of double ended or oligomeric intermediate products. Suitable compounds containing the acid group and another reactive group, with which the intermediate products are then reacted, include strong inorganic acids such as phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, chlorosulphonic acid and sulphamic acid, and organic acids such as alkyl and aryl phosphonic acids, alkyl and aryl sulphonic acids and monochloracetic acid. In preparing the surfactant from the compound of Formula II the reaction of the latter with the compound containing the acid group in the direct route or with the linking compound in the indirect route is carried out under conditions which are appropriate for the reactants involved. Thus, in the case where the compound ofFormula IT is reacted directly with a functional acid such as glycine or glycollic acid the reactants may be heated together at a temperature in the range 180 260 C, if desired in the presence of a solvent such as xylene and optionally also in the presence of a catalyst such as zirconium octoate or tetrabutyl titanate, until the acid value of the mixture has fallen to the appropriate level.The reactants are used in approximately stoichiometric proportions with respect to the carboxyl group in the compound of Formula II and the hydroxyl or amino group in the compound bearing the acid group.Similar conditions apply, in the case of the indirect route, to the reaction between the compound of Formula IT and the linking compound, except that only one reactive group in the latter is taken into account in order to ensure that the intermediate product still contains at least one grouping available for subsequent reaction with the compound bearing the acid group. where the linking compound is a hydroxyamine, a reaction temperature in the range 150 200 C may suffice. Here again, an inert solvent or diluent and or a catalyst may be present if desired In the second stage of the indirect route, the intermediate product is reacted with the compound containing the acid group at a temperature and for a period of time sufficient for completion of the reaction as indicated by the attainment of a substantially constant acid value of the reaction mixture. Where the compound containing the acid group is a polybasic acid such as phosphoric acid or sulphuric acid, it is preferred that only one of the ionisable hydrogen atoms therein is reacted and that no attempt is made to remove water of reaction it is found that reaction for about 3 hours at a temperature in the range 40 700C is usually adequate, more stringent conditions introducing the risk of dehydration of the product, especially where sulphuric acid is used.These complications do not arise in the case of monochloracetic acid, but the reaction proceeds more slowly and rather more forcing conditions may be required. In general, the compound containing the acid group is used in an approximately stoichiometric amount with respect to the available reactive groups in the intermediate product taking into account the above mentioned preference in the case of a polybasic acid , but a lower or higher amount than,this may be used if desired. The final products of the preparative procedures outlined above are all acidic in character and may, if desired, be stored and used as surfactants in that form. They may, however, alternatively be neutralised with ammonia, organic bases such as amines or aminoalcohols, or inorganic bases before storage or use. ii Surfactant of Formula III The surfactant of Formula III, in which Y is a direct link, may be prepared by reaction of a polyester having a terminal carboxylic acid group with an amino or hydroxy organic sulphonate or phosphonate, and preferably an amino or hydroxy alkyl sulphonate or phosphonate. The surfactant of Formula III, in which t is NR or oxygen, can be prepared by reaction of the same polyester with a diol, a diamine or with an aminoalcohol and subsequently reacting the intermediate formed in the first stage with a phosphating agent, such as phosphorus pentoxide, or a sulphating agent, such as chlpro sulphuric acid. According to a fifth aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a compound according toFormula III, wherein Y is a direct link, which comprises reacting a polyester of the formula A3 CO O B CO m OH V with a compound of the formula H X G k L M VI wherein , B3, X, G, L, X, k and m have the same meanings as inFormula III.

The coating was carried out using a mechanised wire woundK bar Meyer Bar draw down system. The K bar was calibrated to leave a wet film of thickness 50 microns. The machine was modified so that a powerful permanent magnet mounted about 1.5 cm above the polyester film followed the motion of the K bar. In this way a strong magnetic field passed across the wet film before any appreciable solvent evaporation had taken place. The film was then allowed to dry by solvent evaporation. Samples of coated films were then evaluated by conventional techniques on a vibrating sample magnetometer. Table 5 reports the magnetic parameters of coated films determined by this evaluation technique. The magnetic parameters determined were coercivity inOersteds , squareness Br Bs and Magnetic Orientation Ratio OR .Coercivity and squareness are parallel to the direction of travel of the magnet over the film.
