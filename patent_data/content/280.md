## Description
Cardiac Pacemakers This invention relates to cardiac prcemakers and is particularly concerned with the means for making electrical connection between electrical signal generating means and an electrode conductor for conveying pacing signals to the heart. Implantable cardiac pacemakers include an electronic pulse generator which is implanted in the body and an electrode lead or conductor catheter extending from the pulse generator for carrying stimulating pulses to an electrode disposed in or on the heart. Care must be taken over ine connection between the electrode lead and the pulse generator normally a terminal block in the latter , in that the connection must be secure in the body and the interface must be impervious to bbdy fluids. In the past, the electrode lead has been clamped in the terminal block of the pulse generator by a grub screw, with sufficient sealing plugs, sealing rings, gaskets and so forth being provide to exclude body fluids.The grub screw type fitting is not entirely satisfactory, for example the end of the screw tends to burr over and the clamping which is provided is over one a limited area of contact between the grub screw and the electrode lead. The foregoing prior art feedthroughs and connectors also present difficulties in terms of speed and accuracy of the catheter installation into or removal from the pacer hus, quite aside from the integrity of the seals, the prior zlt systems sometime present difficulty to doctors during 11e process of surgery either to install or to change pacers. lealy, during the process of installing or replacing acer, t is important to maintain the continuity of the facing pulses, while insuring an accurately installed catheter which is maintained in a suitable degree of tension in the feedthrough connection. The object of the invention is to provide an improved connector system for such apparatus which not only provides a greater area of clamping contact of the electrode lead relative to the terminal block, but also, at the same time, enables electrode leads of differing diameters to be accommodated within the same terminal block. With these advantages, sealing of the connection from body fluids can still be maintained. According to the invention there is provided a cardiac pacemaker including implantable housing means, electrical signal generating means enclosed within said housing, an electrode conductor for conveying pacing signals to the heart, and apparatus for maintaining sealable electrical nterconnection between said generating means and said electrode, characterised in that said apParatus comprises a first terminal means having one end sealed and embedded within said housing, and its other end defining a channel opening to the outside of said housing, said first terminal means having screw threading along at least a portion of said channel, a void at the embedded end of said terminal, and a frustoconical, electrically conductive surface intermediate said void.and said threading, said surface tapering outwardly to said threading and being adapted for electrical connection with said generating and econd terminal means, disjoint from said housing . J . for mating connection into said first terminal said second terminal means defining an axial channel rough or carrying said conductor into a first end, through said axial channel, and out of the opposite end, said second terminal means having a frustocinical camming portion at said opposite end for engagement with the frustoconical surface of said first terminal means, said second terminal means further having a threaded portion intermediate said camming portion and said first end, for engagement with said threading of said first terminal means c said second terminal means being adapted to carry said conductor into said void, and with increasing engagement of said thraaded portion and said threading, to cause said camming portion to grasp said conductor and to establish an electrical circuit between said conductor and said generating means via said frustoconical surface and said camming portion. Since the pacemaker and electrode conductors can be supplied for implantation separately and since the pacemaker can, within reason, make electrical connection with electrode conductors of different diameters, the pacemaker itself including the interconnection apparatus forms a separate aspect of the invention. In accordance with another feature of the invention, the second terminal means is provided with two or more notches surrounding the entry point of the electrode conductor the catheter , and a separate spanner has protuberances matable with the notches. The spannerincludes a recessed channel to accommodate the catheter, and thereby may be utilized to tighten or loosen the second terminal means and catheter from the first terminal means.. Utilization of connector systems in accordance with the principles of the present invention facilitates a pacer feedthrough scheme whereby the entire pacer housing constitutes two portions, one carrying the interconnection apparatus, and the other carrying the balante òf the pacer apparatus. These separate portions are separately manufactured and stored, subsequently to be str.ucturnlly and electrically interconnected. Figure 1 illustrates the component parts of a preferred embodiment of the invention, disassembled Figure. 2 Wllustrates the components shown in Figure 1 when assembled together to form the connected system and Figure 3 shows a conventionally configured pacer having a catheter inserted in accordance with the principles of the present invention Figure 4 shows an exploded schematic of the system in accordance with the principles of the present invention, further including a spanner adapted for utilization therewith Figure 5 shows a partial cutaway of a pacer installaticn incorporating the principles of the present invention. Figure 6 shows a sectional view of a portion of the embodiment of Figure 5, and .Fig ires 9 and 10 show further sections of the embodiment of Figure 6 Figure 7 shows a view in partial cutaway of.an installed tion employing the principles of the present invention ind Figure 8 shows a partial section top view of the embodiment of Figure 7. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, the connector system comprises a terminal block 2, a connector 4, and a pacemaker electrode lead 6. The terminal block 2 is installed within the plastics wall 8 of an implantable pacemaker casing. The terminal block 2 is located at the end of a cylindrical bore 10 leading to the outer surface of the casing the block is formed of an electrically conductive metal and is electrically connected to the pácemaker electrical circuitry not shown . The terminal block has a bore 12 having a threaded portion 14, a tapering, conical portion 16, and a narrower portion 18. The connector 4 is form.ed of four components a metal collet 20 a cylindrical plastics body 22., .a metal end portion 24, and an outer plastics sealing sleeve 26. The collet 20 has an axial bore 28, a threaded outer surface 30 terminating in a tapering, conical portion 32. A number of radially disposed slots 34 extend inwardly from the end of the collet adjacent the tapering, conical portion vide clamping jaws for the electrode lead. The coposl of the collet is embedded within the plasti s ody 22. The plastics body 22 has an andal bore 36 concen with that of the collet and is firmly connected to the end portion 24. The latter also is provided with a bore concentrie with that of the collet and plasties body. pair of radially opposed slots 40 are provided at the the metal end portion 24 remote from the collet. The outer sealing sleeve 26 surrcunds the outer cylindrical surface of the plastics body 22 and methal end portion 24. The diameters of the latter two components are arranged such that the sleeve 26 fits snugly within ore of the pacemaker casing. To ensure a liquid tight seal the sleeve 26 is provided with a series of faised circumferen lands 42 which are under compression when the connecto is inserted within bore 10 Figure 2 . The pacemaker electrode lead 6 comprises an electrical conductor 44 which normally leads to the heart and which includes an exposed connector pin portion 46. The conductor 44 is surrounded by a plastics insulating body 48 having diameter sufficient to fit snugly with the bores 36 and 38 of the plastics body 22 and of the metal end portion 24, respectively. The insulating body is provided with a cer of raised circumferential lands 50 which are under compression when the insulating body 48 is inserted nth bores 36 and 38, thus providing a liquid tignt seal Figure 2 . The components of the connector system are assemblea kshown in Figure 2, with the electrode lead 6 within the connector 4, The connector pin portion 46 of the fermer extends to, and slightly beyond the slotted and or the collet 20. The connector is inserted within the ere 0 of the pacemaker casing with the threads of the engaging those of the threaded portion block 2. To facilitate the engagement portions, a small locking spanner not own projections may be employed, with the projections engaging .e zle ts 40 on the metal end portion 24. Alternatively.portions may be left protruding from the pacemaker casing for engagement by, e.g. a spanner. As the threads are engaged, the tapering conical surface 32 of the collet approaches and then contacts the complementary tapering conical portion 16 of the terminal block 2. As the threads are then further engaged, the tapering conical surface 32 is urged inwardly by a camming action relative to tapering conical portion 16 this movement being enabled by the presence of the slots 34 on the collet. Eventually the inward movement is sufficient for the end of the metal collet adjacent the tapering surfaces to engage and hold firmly the exposed connector pin portion 46 of the electrode lead 6. There then exists a good electrical connection between the terminal block 2 and the electrode lead 6. There also exists, as explained above, a liquidtight seal between the pacemaker casing and the connector 4 at the interface of bore 10 and cuter sealing sleeve 26 and between the connector 4 and the electrode lead 6 at the interface of bores 36 and 38 and plastics body 48 . Liquids such as body fluids cannot therefore encroach into the pacemaker casing through the bore 10 in the latter and he opening provided by bore 12 in the terminal block 2. It will be appreciated with the above embodiment that the collet can be employed to clamp electrode leads having connector pin portions of differing diameters. If necessary, collets having different sized axial bores 28 can be supplied so that a choice can be made to select the most aropriate combination for the electrode lead to be nployed. In the above illustrated embodiment the wall of the maker casing has been described as of plastics material d it could be of another material such as metal n cass provision would probably be made for insulating annector from the electricallag conductive wall Figure shows an isometric view of a acer wherein an electrical lead is conn cted and cealed in place in accordance with the rinciples of the tresent invention. The pacer of Figure 3 is encased in a housing 501 of contompora y configuration and design, advantageously composed or a meta or alloy which is non reactive with body tissues and fludis.The plastic sealing sleeve 26 in accordance with the principles of the present invention defines ontermest circumferential flange 624 which engages the ho ping 501 when the lead 6 is in place and electrical contact is being made generally as shown in Figure 2. Hence, the catheter 644 extends outwardly, as is known in the art, and into the patient s body such as to the heart for pacing. With reference to Figure 4, there is shown an exploded view of the elements of Figure 3 incorporating the principles of the present invention. It is understoed that the plastics wall 8 of the embodiment of Figure and 2 is shown in Figure 4 as a cylindrical part 608 having an anial bore 708 therein to accommedate the connector 4, and the plasties sleeve 26 thereof, which in turn carries a collet 20 as shown herein.The cylindrical bod 608 is fixedly nted within the housing 501, as shown hareinafter, and ineindes an outwardly penetrating electrical connrection terminal 602, which in turn makes electrical connection through a i a le terminal block cet shown in Figures 3 r tut clearly shown in Figure 6 , whereby the col t 20 makes electrical contact therewith. The catheter 644 has n lesulated body 48 penetrated by pin 46, and the raised cir lands 50 insure a seal within the conn A spanne 600 is utilis as desoribed herein to te installation of the electrode lead 6 ithin conne nd in turn within the lindrical rt 608 and end, the spenner 600 nocrporates 2 such as of plast or tal, en in 604, and intergrel ces 605 with the lly ed lots 0 of the ector .The spanner 590 segment of the insulating body A e rring next to bigure 5, there is shown an application of the principles of the present specifically wherein utilization of a collet connector in accordance with the present n facilitates bifurcation of the pacer housing 501 itO two separate and distinct parts 701 and 702, generally dcn the line 703 as shown.The cylindrical plastic receptacle 608 is rigidly and fixedly mounted and encased within portion 702 of the pacer housing, and the electronics and battery aspects not shown are encased within the other portion 701. The electriCal connector 602, as aforesaid, extends outwardly from cylindrical portion 608 from portion 702, and into the other portion 701 for electrical connection with the circuitry and the like encased therein. In practice, the top portion 702, including component 608, 602, and the like, may be manufactured and stored separately, to be utilized in conjunction with any circuitry, as desired, which is separately manufactured in portion 701. At the stage of final assembly, portions 701 and 702 are assembled as shown, with electrical contact being established between respective portions 701 and 702 at 602, and the unit is secured and sealed, such as by weldment along line 703. A complete integral unit, such as shown inFigure 3, thereby results. Figure 6 shows a suitable cross section of the Figure 5 apparatus, whereby the feedthrough electrical connection may ba readily understood. Generally, the Figure 6 view is similar to the previously described view of Figure 20 InFigure 6, the lead 6 penetrates the connector 4, which in f fly inserted into the cylindrical portion 608, e llet 20 engaging terminal block 2 within rical leeve 608. Electrical conductor 44 from 614 penetrates the electrical lead 6, through body 48, and within the collet 20.Electrical continuity thereby is establi h from conductor 44. to 46, collet 20, terminal bl , d downwardly extendir electrical connector pin 602. Cross sectional viows and 12 12 are respectively depicted in Figure 9 and 10 thereby affording further clarification of the apparat shown in Figure 6 and in turn, Figure 5. Utilization of the spanner 600 may perhaps be better understood upon consideration of Figure 7, and Figure 8 which is a top sectional view thereof taken along section 10 10. As shown in Figures 7 and 8, the spanner 600 has slots 605 and 607 in matable engagement with radially opposing slots 40 in flange 624 of the connector 4. As shown in Figures 7 and 8, the connector is in the process of insertion, for purposes of forming a connection such as shown in Figures 2 and 6. In such a process, the lead 6, and particularly the tapering portion of insulating body 48 rests within the slot 607 of spanner 600, with catheter lead 644 extending backwardly along the slot and outwardly therefrom. It will be appreciated from consideration ofFigures 4, 7 and 8 that the spanner facilitates proper screw tightening of the connector 4 collet 20 combination within the unit as shown.
