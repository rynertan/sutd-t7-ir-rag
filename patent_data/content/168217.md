## Description
METHOD OF EXTRACTING TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR LIKE SUBSTANCE This invention relates to a simple method of abundantly extracting tumor necrosis factor like substance TNS , which exerts an effective cytotoxicity against tumor cells instead of normal cells. This TNS has a quite similar characteristics of previously known tumor necrosis factor TNF in vivo or vitro. There are many reports of substances which are produced by a few gram positive bacterias or endotoxins, and have a physiological activity as well as a cytotoxic activity CTA to tumor cells. Dr. Carrle et al J. Exp. Med. 142 1600 1605, 1975 , for example, found that a. cytostatic factor for tumor cells was obtained from the peritoneal exudate cells of a normal rat treated with endotoxin. Thereafter, they reported in Nature London , 273 758 759, 1978 that an aforementioned cytostatic factor was arginase. Dr. Reed et al reported in J. Immunol., 115 395 404, 1975 that a protein consisted of a molecular weight of 45.000 daltons was more cytotoxic against cultured tumor cells. This protein was in supernatant produced from cultured cells of an endotoxin treated rat or human. Dr. Carswell et al Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA , 72 9 3666 3670, 1975 reported a phenomena that serum from BCG Bacillus Calmette Guerin infected Swiss mouse CD 1 treated with intravenously injected endotoxin is cytotoxic on cultured L cells of F1 mouse Balb c x C57BL 6 transplanted Meth A sarcoma, and this serum was named as TNF. TNF of Dr. Carswell, however, necessitated a number of animals in order to extract TNF, and it from each animal was necessarily uniform. It consisted of several kinds of serum protein. Processes to extract a small amount of TNF from serum were complex and consuming. The method of extractingTNF, so far, have not always available in procedures or quantity. The objects of this invention are to extract TNS simply and a lot in quantity. The method is the following 1 Maintain in culture a sort of cell of a fibroblast, epithelial or lymphoblast like cell. 2 Kill the cultured cell, naturally or artificially. 3 Extract TNS from the killed cell. The inventor of this invention produced in success a large amount of pure TNS from cultured L 929 fibroblasts, and found that TNS was present in supernatant obtained from centrifugation of fibroblast like cells after step 1 and 2 . The following is described in details as step a , a macrophage cell line of CAMU 3 R or a fibroblast cell line of L 929 are homogeneously killed in culture medium. As step b , the medium in step a is mixed with a tumor cell line of Meth A, and this cells are incubated for 48 hours. As step c , the culture medium containing the killed fibroblast cell line is mixed and incubated with the tumor cell lines of a Meth A for 48 hours. As step d , the killing effect of the fluid in step c which contains a macrophage cell line is compared with that of fibroblast cell lines.This percent index means the cytotoxicity or cytostaticity to tumor cells. The percent indices of the macrophage, fibroblast and artificially destroyed cell lines are 8.8E, 83 7 and 96.9 , respectively. The fluid of a higher percentage was not cytotoxic to normal cells. This result was confirmed by a production of a large amount of TNS in cells in a fibroblast, an epithelial and a lymphoblast like cell. The TNS extraction from fibroblast, epithelial and lymphoblast like cells is significant. Culture of fibroblast, epithelial or lymphoblast like cells obtained in vivo is more simple than of cultured macrophages. These cells are more productive without consuming time than macrophages. TNS from a definite cell is more pure than that from animals. Next, this invention confirmes a biological role of the TNS as a curable drug for cancer. The following procedures are employed as this invention. I Make up of TNS 1 Culture epithelial cells of a CAMU 3 A7 cell in a petri dish. 2 Detach CAMU 3 A7 cells on petri dishes using tripsin orEDTA. 3 Mix the cultured CAMU 3 A7 cells with culture medium such as MEM, RPMI1640 or KN7 including 5 newbprn calf serum, and adjust the cells to the number of 3xlO6 ml. 4 Culture the cell suspension in 1 3 for 96 hours in 5 C02 air at 370C, and allow to kill the cells by overpopulation. 5 Centrifuge this killed CAMU 3 A7 cells at 2000r.p.m. for 10 minutes, and collect the supernatant, which may containsTNS and filtered through a 0.45pm filter. II Identification of TNS 1 Adjust the number of the tumor cells of a Meth A sarcoma of a mouse to 4x105 ml tumor cells the added 5 newborn calf serum culture medium. 2 Mix the solution of II 1 with the same amount of the I 5 solution. 3 Incubate the solution II 2 for 48 hours in 5 C02 air at 370C. 4 Count the number of live tumor cells in II1 3 stained with trypan blue. The positive relationship between the concentration of supernatant TNS and CTA is noted. CTA, that is, is parallel to dosage of TNS. See Table 1. Table 1 48 Hour CTA of a Meth A Sarcoma Culture Medium with Supernatant in Number of Concentration Ratio of Living Cells x104 CAT 1 to 0 68 0 0.9 to 0.1 32.7 44.6 0.8 to 0.2 14.0 79.4 0.7 to 0.3 8.2 87.9 0.6 to 0.4 6.7 90.1 0.5 to 0.5 5.6 91.8 III Biological characteristics of TNS A The supernatant I 5 was heated at 560C for 30 minutes, at 700C for 60 minutes, and at 850C for 15 minutes, respectively. See Table 2. The negative relationship between CTA and heating was noted. Table 2 48 Hour CTA of a Meth A Sarcoma Heating Conditions Number of of Supernatant Living Cells x104 CTA at 560C for 30 Minutes 14.2 76.3 at 700C for 60 Minutes 49.5 17.5 at 850C for 15 Minutes 43.0 28.3 Culture Medium without Supernatant, 60 0 without a Heating Treatment This result indicates that TNS extracted from CAMU 3 A7 is likely to be a glycoprotein, because CTA decline with heating, especially more than 500C. B CTA according to concentrations of CAMU 3 A7 in cell suspension. 1 Prepare, four sets of CAMU 3 A7 cell suspension contaning lxlO6 ml, 2xl06 ml, 3xlO6 ml and 4x106 ml cells and culture them for 96 hours, 2 Kill the suspended cells by over population, 3 Centrifuge and isolate the supernatant, 4 Culture each batches of supernatants for 48 hours, the sarcoma Meth A cell in the medium contaning, and 5 calculate CTA. The result of this experiment indicates that the increased number of suspended cells is parallel to CTA.See Tables 3A and 3B. Table 3A CTA According to Concentrations of CAMU 3 A7 in Cell Suspension Number of Living Cells x104 CTA Culture Medium without Supernatant 63.5 0 Concentration of CAMU 3 A7 Cell Suspension 23.1 63.6 1x106 ml Concentration of CAHU 3 A7 Cell Suspension 18.9 70.2 2x106 ml Table 3B CTA According to Concentrations of CAMu 3 A7 in Cell Suspension Number of Living Cells x104 CTA Culture Medium without Supernatant 80 0 Concentration of CAMU 3 A7 Cell Suspension 3.1 96.1 3x106 ml Table 3B continued CTA According to Concentrations of CAMU 3 A7 in Cell Suspension Number of Living Cells x104 CTA 8 Concentration of CAMU 3 A7 Cell Suspension 1.3 98.4 4xlO6 ml The explanation about II is as follows II 1 Epithelial like cells of a CAMU 3 A7 cells cultured in a petri dish. II 2 Detach cells from the petri dish face using tripsin or EDTA. II 3 mix the culture cells in culture medium such as MEM, RPMI1640 or KN7 contaning 5 newborne calf serum and adjust the cell concentration of 3x106 ml in suspension. II 4 Put the cell suspension into a cryotube and freeze quickly in liquid nitrogen and keep it for 5 minutes. II 5 Thaw it in 37 C hot water for 10 minutes. II 6 Repeat 11 4 and II 5 three times. II 7 Centrifuge the solution II 6 at 2000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes, and separate the supernatant, which may contain TNS. In comparison of TNS I and TNS II , each CTA was identical and the same CTA was obtained from the supernatant of the lymphoblast like cell RLt 1 or the fibroblast like cell L929 instead of CAMU 3 A7. See Table 4.

B Epithelial like cells which adhere on a glass face of a petri dish form a polyhedral style, when they are separated from in vivo and are isolated by using trips in or EDTA. C Lymphoblast like cells which partly adhere on a glass face of a petri dish drift in culture medium and form a sphere style, when they are separated from in vivo and are isolated by using tripsin or EDTA. Most of fibroblast like cells, epithelial like cells or lymphoblast like cells have few characteristics such as Fc receptor, C3 receptor or phagocytosis, a cytotoxic activity on tumor cells, which macrophages normally have. Cells having a tumorigenicity which are produced by tumor viruses or cancerogenic substances are classified into the same kind of fibroblast like cells, epithelial like cells or lymphoblastlike cells. The following experiment was tried to confirm a molecular weight of TNS produced from a CAMU 3 A7 adjusted to 3x106 ml and destroyed by a quick freezing and thawing. A special membrane which can be filtered less than a molecular weight of lox104, 3x104 or 1x105 respectively was used in order to confirm the molecular weight of TNS in the supernatant.Table 5 shows the results of this experiment.

The following experiment was tried to confirm CTA on tumor cells of a Meth A sarcoma cultured for 48 hours in a culture medium mixed with a supernatant produced from several kinds of cells. The results of this experiment are shown in Tables 6 to 8.

On the other hand, each supernatant contained a destroyed Meth A sarcoma, SV T2, YAC 1 or XC shows a small percentage of CTA. The following experiment was tried to confirm CTA on the tumor cells of a Meth A sarcoma cultured for 48 hours in a culture medium mixed with a supernatant produced from a macrophage cell line such as CAMU 3 R or CAMU 31 R adjusted to 4xlO6 ml, 5x106 ml, 6x106 ml, 7xlO6 ml or 8x106 ml, respectively. The results of this experiment are shown inTables 9 and 10.

The following experiment was tried to confirm CTA on normal cells separated from a minched spleen or a minched fetus of a Balb c mouse in a gestation period cultured for 48 hours in a culture medium mixed with a supernatant produced from a CAMU 3 A7 or a L929 adjusted to 3xlO6 ml and cultured for 96 hour. The results of this experiment are shown in Table 11.

The following results are shown in the above mentioned experiments.1. Factor having a high percentage of CTA on tumor cells is presents in supernatant produced from killed or destroyed epithelial like, fibroblast like or lymphoblast like cells.2. The factor is effective on tumor cells under the circumstances of up to the heating temperature of 560C for 30 minutes. It also loses CTA on tumor cells under the circumstances of mqre than the heating temperature of 700C for 1 hour. 3. The molecular weight of the factor is more than of 100,000.4. No macrophage cell line has an useful CTA.5. The above mentioned CTA is inactive to normal cells. From these results, it is confirmed that the characteristics of the factor are quite similar to that ofTNF. As is evident from the experiments, it is confirmed that effective TNS can be extracted from the supernatant contained killed or destroyed fibroblast, epithelial or lymphoblast like cells. By another experiments, it is confimed that effective TNS can be extracted from the supernatant contained epithelial like cells destroyed by a supersonic instead of a quick freezing and quick thawing.
