# POLYMERIC ELECTRODE

## Abstract
A conductive polymeric electrode structure for elec trochemical cells which comprises particles of electrode material encradled in a porous fibre containing polymeric material is disclosed. The electrode is made by dry proces sing the electrode material, a polymeric pore forming mate rial which is soluble in aqueous media and a fibrillatable polymer to fibrillate the latter and form a homogeneous mixture, and dissolving out the pore forming material. Preferably the fibrillation and mixing are effected simul taneously.
