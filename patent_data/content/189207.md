# FREEZER WITH MEANS FOR INDICATING THE DURATION OF CONSERVABILITY OF ARTICLES

## Abstract
A freezer comprises a freezing compartment and a refrigerant circuit of the automatic control type and is provided with a selector unit adapted to supply a comparator with at least one parameter corresponding to the nature of a respective article within the freezing compartment. Control means are provided for determining the time required for freezing the respective article and for supplying a corresponding second parameter to the comparator. The comparator controls a display unit in response to the coincidence of the said parameters by means of a signal representative of the conservability of the frozen article.
