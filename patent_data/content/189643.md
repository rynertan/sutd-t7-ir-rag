## Description
The present invention relates to an aromatic polyamic acid i.e., polyamide acid solution composition useful as a dope for the preparation of an aromatic polyimide film, which is used for the production of a polyimide composite sheet inclusive of a tape comprising an aromatic polyimide film or layer and a metal film or layer, that is advantageously used for a copper clad laminate for the production of a printed circuit board used in the electronic and electric industries or is used for other electronic material, for example, a magnetic tape, according to the kind of the metal material. Furthermore, the present invention relates to an aromatic polyimide film made from this solution composition. Polyimide composite materials, such as composite sheets, comprising an aromatic polyimide film layer and a layer of a metal material are known. These known polyimide composite sheets comprising a polyimide film layer and a layer of a metal material, however, have some problems. For example, since the aromatic polyimide constituting the aromatic polyimide film layer has a considerably larger thermal expansion coefficient than that of the metal film layer, when a composite sheet is prepared by integrally laminating the polyimide film and the metal film under heating and when the formed composite sheet is exposed to a high temperature during processing or while it is used, the composite sheet curls. Moreover, since the aromatic polyimide film is not completely satisfactory in mechanical strength, heat resistance the heat resistance at the soldering step or flexibility, the obtained composite sheet cannot be advantageously used on an industrial scale as an electric or electronic material. Patent Abstract of Japan, Vol. 4, No.34 c 3 516 , 12 3 91 discloses the preparation of polyimide molded articles from a solution of an aromatic polyamic acid prepared by polycondensing essentially equi molar amounts of 3,3 ,4,4 biphenyl tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride with 4, 4 diamino diphenyl ether and p phenylenediamine to form polyamic acid and dissolving the polyamic acid in an organic polar solvent. Patent Abstract of Japan, Vol.9, No.12 c 261 1735 , 18 1 1985 discloses an aromatic polyamic acid solution composition prepared by polymerizing substantially equimolar amounts of 3,3 ,4,4 biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride and pyrotrimellitic dianhydride with 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether to form polyamic acid and dissolving 5 40wt of the polyamic acid in an organic polar solvent. In view of the forgoing, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide an aromatic polyimide film capable of providing an excellent polyimide composite sheet having none of the defects of the known polyimide composite sheets. Another object of the present invention is to provide a solution composition comprising an aromatic polyamic acid which is a precursor of the above mentioned aromatic polyimide film. In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an aromatic polyamic acid solution composition comprising an aromatic polyamic acid dissolved in an amount of 5 to 40 by weight in an organic polar solvent. This aromatic polyamic acid is prepared by polymerizing substantially equimolar amounts of an aromatic tetracarboxylic acid component comprising, based on the total amount of the aromatic tetracarboxylic acid component, 15 to 85 mole of a biphenyltetracarboxylic acid or a functionally equivalent derivative thereof and 15 to 85 mole of a pyromellitic acid or a functionally equivalent derivative thereof, and an aromatic diamine component comprising, based on the total amount of the aromatic diamine component, 30 to 100 mole of a phenylene diamine and 0 to 70 mole of a diaminodiphenyl ether. In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an aromatic polyimide film formed by casting or coating the above mentioned aromatic polyamic acid solution composition in the form of a film, and then maintaining the film at a high temperature to remove the organic polar solvent and imidize the polyamic acid. In still another aspect of the present invention there is provided a composite sheet comprising a polyimide layer and a metal layer. The polyimide layer has a second order transition temperature of at least 300 C, a thermal expansion coefficient of 1.0 x 10 ⁵ to 3.0 x 10 ⁵ cm cm C, a modulus of elasticity of 300 to 900 kg mm² and an elongation of at least 20 . The aromatic polyamic acid solution composition of the present invention can be easily formed into an aromatic polyimide film by the solution casting method or the like. Furthermore, the aromatic polyimide film obtained from this solution composition has a relatively small thermal expansion coefficient which is close to the thermal expansion coefficient of an ordinary metal film, and the aromatic polyimide film has not only high mechanical strength but also good flexibility. Accordingly, a composite sheet comprising an aromatic polyimide film layer formed from the solution composition of the present invention and a metal film layer does not curl, even though the composite sheet undergoes a high heat history during preparation. Since the aromatic polyimide film inclusive of a film, a sheet, a covering or the like has a relatively high second order transition temperature, even if the composite sheet is exposed to a high temperature up to about 300 C at the soldering step or the other processing steps, no particular problem occurs, and the composite sheet exhibits an excellent heat resistance. The aromatic polyamic acid used in the present invention is a high molecular weight aromatic polyamic acid obtained by polymerizing substantially equimolar amounts of an aromatic tetracarboxylic acid component comprising, based on the total amount of the aromatic tetracarboxylic acid component, 15 to 85 mole , preferably 20 to 85 mole of a biphenyltetracarboxylic acid or a functionally equivalent derivative thereof and 15 to 85 mole preferably 15 to 80 mole , of a pyromellitic acid or a functionally equivalent derivative thereof and an aromatic diamine component comprising, based on the total amount of the aromatic diamine component, 30 to 100 mole , preferably 40 to 95 mole , of a phenylene diamine, and 0 to 70 mole , preferably 5 to 60 mole , of a diaminodiphenyl ether. If the ratio of the biphenyltetracarboxylic acid in the aromatic tetracarboxylic acid component is too low, an aromatic polyimide film formed from the obtained aromatic polyamic acid has an increased thermal expansion coefficient or a reduced tensile elongation at break, and the final composite sheet has a poor flexibility. If the ratio of the biphenyltetracarboxylic acid in the aromatic tetracarboxylic acid is too high, the formed aromatic polyimide film has a low second order transition temperature. It is sufficient if the sum of the amounts of the biphenyltetracarboxylic acid and the pyromellitic acid is about 100 mole in the aromatic tetracarboxylic acid component. However, part of each of the foregoing tetracarboxylic acids may be substituted by other aromatic tetracarboxylic acid in an amount of up to about 5 mole based on the total amount of the tetracarboxylic acid component. In view of the properties of the obtained aromatic polyimide film, it is more preferable that an aromatic tetracarboxylic acid component comprising 25 to 85 mole of a biphenyltetracarboxylic acid and 15 to 75 mole of a pyromellitic acid be used as the aromatic tetracarboxylic acid component. In the aromatic diamine component, if the ratio of the phenylene diamine is too low and ratio of the diaminodiphenyl ether is too high, an aromatic polyimide film formed from the obtained aromatic polyamic acid has a high thermal expansion coefficient or a low modulus of elasticity or second order transition temperature, and thus has poor stiffness and heat resistance. If the ratio of the phenylene diamine is close to 100 mole , the elongation and other physical properties of the aromatic polyimide film are sometimes degraded, and the polyimide film is broken under an abrupt tension or impact or the stiffness becomes too high and the flexibility is reduced. It is sufficient if the sum of the amounts of the phenylene diamine and the diaminodiphenyl ether is about 100 mole in the aromatic diamine component. However, a part of each of the foregoing diamines may be substituted by other aromatic diamine in an amount of up to about 5 mole based on the total diamine component. In view of the properties of the obtained aromatic polyimide film, it is most preferred that an aromatic diamine component comprising 55 to 90 mole of a phenylene diamine and 10 to 45 mole of a diaminodiphenyl ether be used as the aromatic diamine component. As preferred examples of the biphenyltetracarboxylic acid and its functionally equivalent derivative used in the present invention, there can be mentioned 2,3,3 ,4 biphenyltetracarboxylic acid and its dianhydride, 3,3 4,4 biphenyltetracarboxylic acid and its dianhydride, and lower alcohol esters of these acids. As preferred examples of the pyromellitic acid and its functionally equivalent derivatives, there can be mentioned pyromellitic acid and its dianhydride, and lower alcohol esters thereof. As preferred examples of the other tetracarboxylic acid that can be used as part of the foregoing aromatic tetracarboxylic acid component, there can be mentioned 3,3 ,4,4 benzophenone tetracarboxylic acid and its dianhydride, bis 3,4 dicarboxyphenyl methane dianhydride, and bis 3,4 dicarboxyphenyl ether dianhydride. As the phenylene diamine to be used in the present invention, there can be mentioned 1,4 diaminobenzene p phenylenediamine , 1,3 diaminobenzene, and 1,2 diaminobenzene. As the diaminodiphenyl ether, there can be mentioned 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether, 3,3 diaminodiphenyl ether, and 3,4 diaminodiphenyl ether. As the other diamine that can be used as part of the foregoing aromatic diamine component, there can be mentioned 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethane, 3,3 diaminodiphenylmethane, 3,4 diaminodiphenylmethane, 4,4 diaminobenzophenone, 4,4 diaminodiphenylsulfone, o toluidine, and 3,5 diaminobenzoic acid. This aromatic polyamic acid is a polymer having a high molecular weight as corresponding to a logarithmic viscosity number of 0.1 to 5, especially 0.2 to 3 , as determined at 30 C with respect to an N methyl 2 pyrrolidone solution having a polymer concentration of 0.5 g 100 ml. The polymer has amide acid linkages as the linkages of the main chain and is soluble in an organic polar solvent. When this polyamic acid is imidized by heating or other means, a heat resistant aromatic polyimide consisting essentially of imide linkages is obtained. The aromatic polyamic acid used in the present invention is prepared by polymerizing substantially equimolar amounts of the above mentioned aromatic tetracarboxylic acid component and aromatic diamine component at a polymerization temperature preferably not higher than 100 C, more preferably not higher than 80 C, for 0.2 to 60 hours in an organic polar solvent so that a desired high molecular weight is attained. In the above mentioned polymerization process, polymerization is ordinarily conducted batchwise or in a continuous manner while equimolar amounts of the tetracarboxylic acid component and the diamine component are simultaneously supplied. However, there may be adopted a method in which the respective monomer components are not used simultaneously in equimolar amounts but are added at different ratios at different times so that the amounts of both components finally become equimolar. In the above mentioned preparation process, it is not indispensable that the tetracarboxylic acid component and diamine component be used in absolutely equimolar amounts. In order to adjust the molecular weight, one of the two components may be used in a molar excess of up to 3 mole , especially up to 1 mole . An organic polar solvent having a boiling point not higher than 300 C, especially not higher than 250 C, under atmospheric pressure is preferably used as the organic polar solvent in the above mentioned polymerization process. Such organic polar solvents include, for example, N methyl 2 pyrrolidone, dimethylsulfoxide, N,N dimethylacetamide, N,N dimethylformamide, N,N diethylacetamide, N,N diethylformamide, and dimethylsulfone. These organic polar solvents may be used in the form of mixtures with other organic solvents such as benzene, toluene, benzonitrile, xylene, solvent naphtha, and dioxane. The aromatic polyamic acid solution composition of the present invention is a solution composition in which the specific aromatic polyamic acid prepared in the above mentioned manner is dissolved in an organic polar solvent at a concentration of 5 to 40 by weight, preferably 5 to 35 by weight, more preferably 7 to 30 by weight. The solution composition of the present invention may be prepared by isolating the aromatic polyamic acid prepared in the above mentioned manner from the polymerization reaction liquid and dissolving the isolated polymer in an organic polar solvent. Alternatively, a method may be adopted in which the same solvent as used for the solution composition is used as the polymerization solvent in the above mentioned process for the preparation of the aromatic polyamic acid, namely, the respective monomers are polymerized in this organic polar solvent and thus the solution composition of the present invention is formed directly without isolation of the aromatic polyamic acid. In view of the ease in handling of the solution composition, it is preferred that the rotation viscosity i.e., a solution viscosity as determined at 30 C by using a rotational viscometer be 0.1 to 50000 poise 0.01 to 5000Pas especially 0.5 to 30000 poise 0.05 to 3000 Pas , more especially 1 to 20000 poise 0.1 to 2000Pas . The aromatic polyimide film is prepared, for example, according to a process in which the above mentioned aromatic polyamic acid solution composition is cast or coated on the surface of an appropriate support such as a metal, ceramic or plastic roll, a metal belt, or a roll or belt to which a metal film tape is being supplied at normal temperature or under heating to continuously form a film of the solution composition having a uniform thickness of 10 to 2000 µm, especially 30 to 1000 µm, and the film on the support is gradually heated at temperatures ranging from 50 to 500 C under atmospheric or reduced pressure to dry the film and solidify the film by evaporating the solvent from the film, and the polyamic acid solidified film is imidized cyclized to imide ring under heating at a high temperature so that the imidation degree is at least 90 , preferably at least 95 , whereby an aromatic polyimide film having a thickness of 0.5 to 300 µm, preferably 1 to 200 µm is obtained. The average thermal expansion coefficient of the aromatic polyimide film of the present invention at temperatures ranging from 100 to 300 C is relatively small and is close to those of ordinary metals such as copper and its alloys, and iron, nickel, cobalt, chromium, and alloys thereof for example, steel, nickel steel, chromium steel, and magnetic materials . Accordingly, a composite sheet comprising a film layer of such a metal and a layer of the aromatic polyimide film of the present invention does not curl when heated at the preparation step or other steps, and therefore, this composite sheet can be advantageously used as a flexible printed circuit board copper clad laminates . The aromatic polyimide film of the present invention has excellent mechanical properties such as a tensile strength of at least about 20 kg mm², especially at least 25 kg mm², an elongation of at least about 20 , and a modulus of elasticity of 300 to 900 kg mm², and has excellent thermal properties such as a high second order transition temperature of at least about 300 C and a high thermal decomposition initiation temperature of at least about 400 C. Accordingly, the aromatic polyimide film of the present invention can be practically and satisfactorily applied to the above mentioned uses. If the above mentioned monomer components are used at appropriately selected ratios in preparing the above mentioned aromatic polyamic acid, there can be obtained an aromatic polyimide film having a a thermal expansion coefficient of 1.0 x 10 ⁵ to 3.0 x 10 ⁵ cm cm c, especially 1.2 x 10 ⁵ to 2.8 x 10 ⁵ cm cm C, b a second order transition temperature higher than 300 C, preferably 305 C to 600 C, more preferably 310 C to 550 C, c a modulus of elasticity of 300 to 900 kg mm², especially 350 to 700 kg mm², and d an elongation of at least 20 , especially 40 to 120 . The aromatic polyimide having these properties has a satisfactory mechanical strength and thermal characteristics as required in the above mentioned uses. As pointed out hereinbefore, the aromatic polyimide film of the present invention is well balanced in various mechanical and thermal properties, and especially, it has a thermal expansion coefficient close to that of an ordinary metal film, a relatively high second order transition temperature, and an excellent electrically insulating property. Accordingly, the aromatic polyimide film of the present invention is useful as a protecting covering film or supporting film for a metal film layer of an electric or electronic material. More specifically, the aromatic polyimide film of the present invention is advantageously used as a supporting film layer of a flexible printed circuit board or a magnetic tape. The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the following examples and comparative examples. A cylindrical polymerization vessel having an inner volume of 300 ml was charged with 20.5 g 0.07 mole of 3,3 ,4,4 biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride, 6.54 g 0.03 mole of pyromellitic dianhydride, 5.41 g 0.05 mole of p phenylenediamine, 10.01 g 0.05 mole of 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether, and 198.0 g of N methyl 2 pyrrolidone. This liquid mixture was subjected to polymerization at a temperature of 50 C with stirring under atmospheric pressure for 44 hours to obtain a reaction liquid containing about 20.0 by weight of an aromatic polyamic acid having a logarithmic viscosity number of 2.04 as measured at 30 C with respect to an N methyl 2 pyrrolidone solution having a polymer concentration of 0.5 g 100 ml , a rotation viscosity of about 1300 poise 130Pas as measured at 30 C , and an imidation degree lower than 10 . This reaction liquid has a good storage stability and no change was caused when the reaction solution was allowed to stand for about one month. The thus obtained aromatic polyamic acid solution composition was cast on a copper foil having a thickness of about 30 µm thermal expansion coefficient of 1.66 x 10 ⁵ cm cm C to form a film of the solution composition having a uniform thickness of about 150 µm. The solution film was dried and solidified by elevating the temperature within a range of from 60 to 200 C and was then heat treated by elevating the temperature to 350 C to form a copper clad laminate comprising an aromatic polyimide film layer having a thickness of 30 µm and a copper film layer having a thickness of 30 µm. A curl having a radius of curvature smaller than 50 cm was not present in this copper clad laminate, and the copper clad laminate had an appropriate flexibility and could be advantageously used as a flexible printed circuit board. The copper film layer was dissolved away from the thus prepared copper clad laminate by an etching solution to obtain an aromatic polyimide film. The physical properties of this aromatic polyimide film were determined. It was found at the tensile test that the tensile strength was 36.1 kg mm², the elongation was 60 , and the modulus of elasticity was 507 kg mm². When the thermal expansion coefficient was determined at temperatures ranging from 100 to 300 C, it was found that the linear thermal expansion coefficient was 1.9 x 10 ⁵ cm cm C. At the TMA tensile method sample width 5 mm, load 2 g, temperature elevating rate 10 C min , it was found that the second order transition temperature Tg was 360 C, and the thermal decomposition initiating temperature was about 440 C. Aromatic polyamic acid solution compositions were prepared in the same manner as described in Example 1, except that the ratios of the monomers used for the preparation of the aromatic polyamic acid were changed as shown in Table 1. Copper clad laminates were prepared in the same manner as described in Example 1, except that these solution compositions were used. Aromatic polyimide films were prepared in the same manner as described in Example 1, except that these copper clad laminates were used. The physical properties of the films were measured and the obtained results are shown in Table 1. Aromatic polyamic acid solution compositions were prepared in the same manner as described in Example 1 except that the ratios of the monomers used for the preparation of the aromatic polyamic acid were changed as shown in Table 2. Copper clad laminates were prepared in the same manner as described in Example 1, except that these solution compositions were used. Aromatic polyimide films were prepared in the same manner as described in Example 1, except that these copper clad laminates were used. The physical properties of the films were measured and the obtained results are shown in Table 2. In each of the copper clad laminates obtained in the examples of the present invention, since the difference of the thermal expansion coefficient between the aromatic polyimide film layer and the copper film layer was considerably small, a curl having a radius of curvature smaller than 50 cm was not formed, and each substrate was a substantially flat composite sheet. In contrast, in each of the copper clad laminates obtained in the comparative examples, since the difference of the thermal expansion coefficient between the aromatic polyimide film layer and the copper film layer was considerably large, curls having a radius of curvature smaller than 10 cm were present.
