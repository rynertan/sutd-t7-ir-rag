# Holder for a rigid information disc and apparatus comprising a loading mechanism adapted to cooperate with such a holder.

## Abstract
A holder for a rigid information disc 20 comprises a rectangular frame 1 which comprises a first disc supporting section 3 near a first peripheral side 1a of the frame and a second disc supporting section 4 adjoining a second pe ripheral side 1b located opposite the first side. The frame 1 carries movable clamping means 8, 9 for clamping the information disc 20 onto the frame 1 , is at least partly resiliently deflexible and is capable of resiling from a de flected position to a flat position. The first and the second disc supporting sections 3, 4 are interconnected by at least one resilient connecting element 5, 6 which permits deflec tion of the frame 1 in to the deflected position in which a position the first and the second peripheral sides 1a, 1b extend at least substantially parallel to each other. The clamp ing means 8, 9 can be actuated, are situated near the con necting element s 5, 6 and in the deflected position of the frame 1 do not release the information disc 20 until said means have been actuated.
