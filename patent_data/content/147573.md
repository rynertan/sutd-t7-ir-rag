# Air flow meter circuit with temperature compensation circuit.

## Abstract
An air flow meter circuit with a temperature compensa tion circuit comprises an air flow rate detection circuit 20 200 for generating an output signal V₂ in accordance with an air flow rate, an output circuit 30 300 for amplifying the output signal of the air flow rate detection circuit to produce an output signal V₀ whose value is so adjusted as to be related to the value of the input signal in a predetermined relationship, and a constant voltage circuit 10 100 for supplying a predetermined reference voltage to the air flow rate detection and output circuits. In order to compensate the output of the air flow meter circuit for its changes due to the influence of temperature coefficients of component parts of both the air flow rate detection and output circuits, the temperature coeffcient of the output of the constant voltage circuit 10 100 is so adjusted as to cancel out the temperature coefficients of the parts constituting the air flow meter circuit.
