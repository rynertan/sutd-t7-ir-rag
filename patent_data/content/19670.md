## Description
ANTIMICROBIAL COMPOSITIONS AND METHOD OF USE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Antimicrobial compositions are generally added to various kinds of aqueous fluid media to reduce or inhibit the growth of microorganisms. For instance, a wide variety of industrial aqueous fluid media are known such as metal working fluids used with metal working equipment. The development of high speed metal cutting and grinding has resulted in the creation of lubricants containing oils and chemicals stabilized in water. These fluids impart the cooling qualities of water and the lubricating properties of oil which prolongs the life of cutting tools, reduces heat production, improves surface finish of the metal being machined, prevents warping and leaves a rust inhibiting film of oil on the worked piece. Normally these fluids consist of fatty or petroleum oils, soaps or synthetic based materials and additional additives such as antifoam agents, EP additives, preservatives, coupling agents and rust inhibitors. The coolants are generally marketed in the form of concentrates which are normally diluted with water by the user in ratios of 1 part oil to about 20 40 parts of water, but these ratios may vary with particular operations. The lubricant is supplied to a machine from either an individual tank containing fifty to one hundred gallons or from a large sump containing thousands of gallons which supplies many machines. One of the problems often associated with such aqueous fluid media arises from the susceptibility of the media to the infestation and growth of various microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi which particularly feed on the organic components thereof . The presence and buildup of such microorganisms can often lead to interference in the metal working operations as a result of the clogging of filters, buildup of slime and sludge, development of odors, rust, emulsion instability, reduced tool life and poor finish. Furthermore, in machine shops where the workers hands necessarily come in contact with the cutting oil, usually containing finely divided sharp metal cuttings, serious problems of dermatitis may arise.These and other such similar problems have resulted in the continuing need for better antimicrobial additives for aqueous fluid media such as metal working fluids. Much effort has been devoted in recent years to controlling this problem however, it continues to be a major annoyance which costs the metal working industry many millions of dollars each year. A number of suggestions have been made for inhibiting the growth of bacteria in aqueous fluids such as those described in U.S.Patents No. 4,012,261 3,591,679 3,408,843 and 3,240,701. The use of various formaldehyde preservatives for metal working fluids including monomethylol dimethyl hydantoin and dimethylol dimethyl hydantoin has also been proposed See Bennett, E.O.,Int. Biodetn. Bull. 9, pages 95 100, 1973 and Maeda et al., Agr. Biol. Chem., 40, 1111 2222, 1976 . Gray and Wilkinson in J. Gen. Microbiol., 39, 385 399 1965 and J. App. Bact., 28, 153 164 1965 describe the action of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid hereinafter sometimes referred to as EDTA on some bacteria. The effectiveness of such chelating agents as EDTA alone for bacterial control in aqueous systems is disputed as evidenced by U.S.Patents No. 3,240,701 3,408,843 and 3,591,679.The antimicrobial compositions used in metal working fluids seem to suffer from one or more disadvantages including high cost, unacceptable toxicity or low degree of effectiveness at the present state of the art. Accordingly, it is the primary object of the present invention to provide an effective antimicrobial composition formulation for use in an aqueous fluid medium. A further object of the present invention is to provide an effective relatively nontoxic method for inhibiting the growth of microorganisms in an aqueous fluid medium susceptible to such growth. These and other objects of our invention will be apparent from the discussion which follows. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION We have discovered antimicrobial compositions, suitable for inhibiting the growth of microorganisms in an aqueous fluid medium susceptible to such growth, comprising as an active ingredient a condensation product of 5,5 dimethyl hydantoin and formaldehyde e.g., the mono or dimethylol dimethyl hydantoin in combination with a water soluble chelating agent.A preferred antimicrobial composition formulation comprises as an active ingredient 1,3dimethylol 5,5 dimethylhydantoin hereinafter sometimes referred to as DMDMH in combination with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or a water soluble salt thereof, e.g., with alkali metal or ammonium salts. These antimicrobial compositions when added to an aqueous fluid medium provide an unexpected degree of preservation and antimicrobial activity over what one would expect from results obtained by using the hydantoin formaldehyde condensation product or chelating agent i.e.,DMDMH, EDTA, or a salt thereof alone. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The antimicrobial compositions of our invention thus comprise an active combination of a condensation product of 5,5 dimethyl hydantoin and formaldehyde e.g., 1,3 dimethylol5,5 dimethyl hydantoin, l methylol 5,5 dimethyl hydantoin, or 3 methylol 5,5 dimethyl hydantoin, 1, 3 dimethyloloxy methylene 5, 5 dimethylhydantoin and mixtures thereof and a water soluble chelating agent. Condensation products of 5,5 dimethylhydantoin hereinafter referred to as DMH and formaldehyde are well known. For example, DMDMH may be prepared as described in U.S. Patent No.3,987,184, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. This patent describes the use of e.g., 40 75 aqueous solutions of DMDMH as a formaldehyde donor, as well as a preservative, in various pastes, soaps, skin creams, liquid shampoos and other similar preparations. The condensation products of DMH and formaldehyde as used herein are intended to include those products wherein 1,2 or more moles of formaldehyde are condensed with each mole of DMH. Thus, the condensation products include those wherein more than 2 moles of formaldehyde may be condensed with each mole of DMH, such as, for example 1 methylol 3 methyloloxymethylene 5, 5 dimethyl hydantoin and 1,3 dimethylol oxymethylene 5,5dimethyl hydantoin. When added to an aqueous fluid medium, we have now found that when an antimicrobial DMH formaldehyde condensation product such as DMDMH is used in combination with a chelating agent such as EDTA or a water solubleEDTA salt a greatly enhanced degree of antimicrobial activity is obtained. When a chelating agent such as EDTA or an EDTA water soluble salt is used alone at the concentration levels here involved , there is generally no significant antimicrobial activity exhibited. Further, while antimicrobial activity is observed when theDMH formaldehyde condensation product alone is used by itself, the level of such activity is less than is desired.However, when according to the invention the chelating agent is used in combination with the DMH formaldehyde condensation product, for reasons not entirely clear at present, the presence of the chelating agent has an unexpected effect of potentiating or greatly enhancing the antimicrobial activity of the said hydantoincondensation component, as is more fully described below. As used herein, chelating agents are defined as water soluble substances which when added to an aqueous fluid medium, reduce the normal ionic effects of the cations present.Suitable chelating agents according to the present invention may include EDTA, and diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid hereinafter sometimesDTPA and similar compounds as well as their water soluble salts e.g., sodium salts . While ethylenediaminetetraacetric acid itself may be employed, it is preferred to use one of its water soluble salts, such as alkali metal salts, for example the disod salt sometimes referred to as EDTA diNa or the tetra sodium salt sometimes referred to hereinafter as EDTA tNa . The comparable potassium salts, and the ammonium salts may also be used. The antimicrobial compositions of the present invention may thus generally be formulated to contain the active hydantoin formaldehyde condensation product and chelating agent in a weight ratio ranging from about 0.25 1 to 20 1, and preferably about 1 1 to 5 1 hydantoin to chelating agent with or without additional inert liquid vehicles or dispersants, or solid extenders, or inert carriers. Most preferably, and conveniently, compositions may be formulated containing less than about 5 by weight of the chelating agent. In use these antimicrobial composition formulations may be added to an aqueous fluid medium in the form of a solid block or tablet, as a powder, or preferably as a solution. In order to achieve practical level of inhibition of microorganism growth in the aqueous fluid medium it is necessary to include therein the combination of active hydantoin i.e., mono or dimethylol 5,5 dimethyl hydantoin and chelating agent in an amount sufficient to inhibit the growth of microorganisms. As used herein, the term inhibitive amount is to be understood as that amount of the said combination which when added to an aqueous fluid medium will acceptably inhibit the growth of microorganisms in the use of said medium. Furthermore, this level of inhibition will be greater than the additive level of inhibition one would obtain with the active hydantoin product in the absence of the chelating agent e.g., 1 part DMDMH and 1 part EDTA is more inhibitory than 2 parts DMDMH alone . Generally at least 500 parts of the chelating agent and at least 500 parts of active hydantoin are added per million parts of the aqueous fluid medium. Thus, the chelating agent may be added in amounts ranging from about 500 to 4000 parts per million ppm of the aqueous fluid medium. Likewise, one may suitably add from about 500 to 10000 parts of active hydantoin per million parts of the aqueous fluid medium.The weight ratio of condensation product and chelating agent may range suitably from about 0.25 1 to 20 1 and preferably about 1 1 to 5 1.Of course, with an increase in water hardness, the proportional amount of chelating agent may need to be increased to achieve desired results. As used herein, the term aqueous fluid medium is meant to encompass water, oil in water, water in oil emulsions including concentrates and like compositions susceptible to the infestation and growth of microorganisms.Thus, for instance, metal working fluids or cutting oil fluids in diluted as well as undiluted form together with conventional additives such as corrosion inhibitors etc. are to be included. The antimicrobial compositions may be added directly to undiluted metal working fluids. As used herein the term metal working fluid is intended to encompass those compositions known in the art as metal cutting fluids , cutting fluids , coolants , lubricants rolling oils , drawing fluids , mold release fluids , grinding fluids and like products used in the processing of metals as described more fully by Springborn, R.K. Cutting and GrindingFluids Selection and Application, ASTME 1967 and Wilbert J. Olds, Lubricants, Cutting Fluids and Coolants , Cahner s Books, the entire contents of each being incorporated herein by reference.Emulsifiable or water miscible oils are widely used in the industry. Mixed with water, they form emulsions for use in rolling, drawing, machining and grinding where the need is for both cooling and lubrication. More recently, water miscible fluids using less oil or no oils and based on chemicals with or without surface active agents, have provided industry with products of even greater heat conducting properties for still higher machining rates. The following examples are offered in order to more fully illustrate the invention, but are not to be construed as limiting the scope thereof.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE Test units employed consisted of quart jars placed in rows. Above each row a metal framework was constructed to support the aeration system which consisted of aquarium valves connected together with plastic tubing. The amount of aeration of each jar unit was controlled by adjusting the valves. Capillary pipettes were employed as aerators to produce a fine stream of bubbles. Five hundred ml of tap water moderate hardness was added to each jar unit. DMDMH andEDTA and DTPA were used as obtained from the manufacturer and the desired amount wt vol or vol vol of each product was added to each unit along with the required amount of coolant concentrate to produce the desired oil water ratio. DMDMH was used as a 55 aqueous solution, identified as DMDMH 55 . The unit was then made up to a total volume of 600 ml with additional tap water. The jars were inoculated with a mixture of bacteria and fungi which were obtained and maintained as described in The Deterioration of Metal Cutting Fluids, Prog. Indust. Microbiol., 13, 121 249, 1974 by E.O. Bennett, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Over the years, samples of spoiled coolants have been obtained from many sources.These samples have been kept viable by growing them in metal working fluids. The inoculum employed in the antimicrobial tests contains these organisms and is aerated at all times.Normally, it contains between ten million to one hundred million organisms per ml. Initially and once each week thereafter all units were inoculated with 1.0 ml of a 50 50 mixture of the two inocula i.e., bacteria and fungi . The units were kept at ambient temperatures 27.00C. to 28.5 C. . The test units were studied for their microbial content at weekly intervals by making serial dilutions of the coolant into a medium as described in the Prog. Indust. Microbiol. article noted above. Each unit was studied for so long as the counts remained below 100,000 organisms ml. Two consecutive counts in excess of this figure at weekly intervals was considered to constitute the point of failure, and the test was discontinued at that time. Since the test vessels were under constant aeration, there was considerable evaporation from each jar unit. The units were calibrated at the 600 ml mark and once or twice each week distilled water was added to bring the liquid level back to this mark. Distilled water was used in order to avoid a buildup of inorganic salts which would have taken place if tap water had been employed. Base control tests in each instance revealed that the coolants employed without the addition of chelating agent and or hydantoin product failed within one week due to the growth of microorganisms. Examples A and B are comparative examples Examples 1 through 4 are illustrative embodiments of this invention.EXAMPLE A A series of sample jar units were prepared according to the procedure outlined above in order to ascertain the antimicrobial effect of l,3 dimethylol 5,5 dimethyl hydantion.Samples tested were A 1500 ppm of 55 aqueous solution of 1,3 dimethylol 5,5 dimethylhydantoin hereinafter sometimes referred to as DMDMH 55 B 300 ppm DMDMH 55 and C 4500 ppm DMDMH 55.
