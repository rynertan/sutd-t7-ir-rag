# Propulsion system.

## Abstract
A propulsion system for converting rotary motion into unidirectional motion includes a frame 10 , a pair of counterrotating lower members 67, 67 rotatably mounted to the frame containing damping elements 72, 72 . A pair of upper members 84, 84 containing damping elements are rotatably mounted to the frame and positioned above the lower members, each at an angle to the lower member so that each contacts a surface of the member below it at a single point 116, 116 . A motor 16 and drive train 18, 20 are provided for driving the lower members. Each lower member includes a pair of studs 80, 82 mounted at its periphery which engage radially extending posts 106, 108 mounted to its corresponding upper cylinder so that rotation of the lower member causes the upper member to rotate in the same sense and at the same angular velocity. The superposition of the damped upper members upon the damped lower members generates unbalanced centrifugal forces which result in a constant unidirectional resultant force.
