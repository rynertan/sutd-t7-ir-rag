# Anchorage means for safety belts.

## Abstract
An adjustable shoulder anchorage for a vehivle safety belt comprises a vertically extending track 10 mounted on the interior of the vehicle body above the level of the shoulders of an occupant of an adjacent seat and having a plurality of in dexing formations 34 facing away from said seat. A traveller 40 is mounted on the track 10 and carries a guide member having a slot for receiving the strap of the safety belt. A latch member 72 is mounted on the traveller 40 for movement between a first position in which a latching 80 formation thereon engages with one of the indexing formations 34 on the track 10 so as to inhibit movement of the traveller 40 along the track 10 and a second position in which the latching formation 80 is disengaged therefrom. The traveller 40 comprises a base plate on the same side of the track 10 as the indexing formations 34 and having emergency latching formations 120 126 for engagement therewith, together with deformable means for holding these latching formations 120 126 away from the indexing formations 34 in normal use. If the shoulder anchorage is jubject to excessive load, the deformable means distorts to allow the emergency latching formations 120 126 to engage with the indexing forma tions.
