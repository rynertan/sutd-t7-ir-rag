# Anti veiling glare glass input window for an optical device and method for manufacturing such window.

## Abstract
Anti veiling glare glass input window for an optical device. The window has throughout a shallow surface layer over its peripheral surfaces radiation absorbent free metal induced colour centres. A method for preparation of such a window, which is particularly suited to be used as an input window for an image intensifier, involves pre shaping the window from clear glass and forming colour centres in a shallow surface layer over at least the peripheral surfaces of the window. If the clear glass contains reduceable metal oxides the colour centres are formed by subjecting at least the peripheral surfaces of the clear glass to a reducing atmosphere at a temperature high enough to cause the reducing atmospheres reducing component to diffuse into a shallow surface layer of the window and to reduce the metal oxides to free metal atoms.
