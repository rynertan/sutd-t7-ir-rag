# A method of coating a metal surface so as to render it non stick and abrasion resistant.

## Abstract
In order to achieve a non stick surface which is signifi cantly harder wearing than hitherto, metal surface a is sand or shot blast and stainless steel or molybdenum is applied thereto so as to cover not less than 65 and not more than 90 thereof and provide a pervious intermediate substrate b having a micro crenellated surface. Thereafter, a primer coat is applied to penetrate pervious layer b and finally a top coat, consisting primarily of a nonstick agent c, such as P.T.F.E, is applied so as to form a matrix of stainless steel or molybdenum impregnated with and covered by the non stick agent.

## Description
A METHOD OF COATING A METAL SURFACE SO ASTO RENDER IT NON STICK AND ABRASION RESISTANT This invention relates to a method of coating a metal surface so as to render it non stick and abrasion resistant. A known method of applying a non stick coating to the metal surface of an article includes the steps of preparing the surface in conventional manner to receive a sprayed coating of molten metal, spraying over said surface a coating of stainless steel or molybdenum to provide a continuous and impervious micro crenellated intermediate surface with microscopic preminences and interstices, abrading said intermediate surfaces to remove any surface film such as oxide, applying a coating of a non stick agent to the abraded surface and sintering or curing the coating so as to provide a firmly bonded complete covering to the sprayed metal coating, In the above method, the metal spray is applied to provide an impervious coat on top of which a layer of a non stick agent, usually P.T.F.E. polytetrafluoroethylene , is applied. Due to the application of the metal spray, the finished coating lasts longer than a coating of P.T.F.E. applied directly onto the bae metal0 Nevertheless, in time, the P.T.F.E. coating is worn away from the surface of the sprayed on metal layer and the non stick property of the surface diminishes. An object of the present invention is to provide an improved method of applying a non stick coating to a metal surface whereby the coating lasts considerably longer than hitherto. With this object in view, the present invention provides a method of coating a metal surface so as to render it non stick and rasion resistant characterised in that the stainless steel or molybdenum v is sprayed onto the metal surface a so as to cover not less than 65 and not more than 90 thereof so that the intermediate substrate is pervious, and in that, prior to application of the non tick agent, a primer coating is applied to penetrate the intermediate substrate so that a matrix of stainless steel or molybdenum b impregnated with the non stick agent c is formed on the metal surface a. The invention will be described further, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a sectional elevation of a shot blasted metal surface Fig. 2 is a similar section after application of a steel or molybdenum coating and Fig. 3 is a similar section to that shown in Fig. 2 after the application of a coiting including a non stick agent to form an impregnated matrix. In a preferred method in accordance with the invention a base metal surface a to be rendered non stick is firstly shot or sand blasted Fig. 1 .Stainless steel or molybdenum is flame sprayed onto the base metal surface a so as to cover not less than 65 and not more than 90 of the metal surface a and provide a pervious intermediate substrate d having a micro crenellated surface Fig. 2 . The thickness of the pervious substrate b is, for example, between 0.025 and 0.050 mm. Once the intermediate pervious substrate b has cooled, a primer of sufficiently low viscosity to penetrate said pervious layer is applied thereto and air or oven dried at about 120 0C to 1500C and allowed to cool. The primer may be aqueous based or resin based, the latter being used whenever a non corrosible final non stick surface is required.A suitable aqueous based primer would be 10 partsP.T.F.E. to 1 part pigment and a suitable resin based primer would be 20 parts resin to 24 parts pigment.It will, however, be appreciated that these are only examples and many other mixtures or solutions of differing composition may be useful. After the primer has dried and cooled, a second or top coat, consisting primarily of a non stick agent such as P.T.F.E. or T.F.E. H.F.P. Tetrafluoroethylene polyhexafluoropropylene , is applied thereover and stored at temperature of 2000C to 450 C for twenty to thirty minutes. A suitable top coat for use after an aqueous based primer is 16 parts P.T.F.E. to 1 part pigment and a suitable top coat for use after a rean based primer, when a non corroding surface is required, is 13 parts P.T.F.E. to 11 partsP.E.S. polyethyl sulphone . The non stick agent c is able to penetrate right through the pervious substrate b to the metal surface a. Fig. 3 illustrates the resultant matrix of stainless steel or molybdenum b impregnated and coated with non stick agent c upon the original metal surface a. This coating lasts considerably longer,i.a. is much more resistant to wear, than any previously known non stick coating.
