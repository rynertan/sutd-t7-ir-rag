# A method of producing a device including a bundle of hollow fibers.

## Abstract
Method for producing a device including a bundle 2 of hollow fibers in an outer housing 1 with the ends of the hollow fibers embedded in two end walls 3, 4 arranged at the opposite ends of the housing 1 , with the ends of the hollow fibers opened to allow free flow through the hollow fibers. At the manufacture each end of the housing with a bundle 2 of fibers arranged therein is enclosed in a casting mold 11, 12 to which the material for the adjacent end walls 3,4 is supplied in a liquid condition penetrating into X and around the fibers Y . The penetration is hereby controlled in such a way that it is less into the fibers than around those fibers and in such a way that the openings of the fibers may be opened by a cut between the surfaces restricting the respective penetration depths. The method according to the invention is characterized in that the respective penetration depth is controlled by exposing the inner of the housing to a positive pressure. Devices of the above mentioned kind are used for e.g. different kinds of medical treatment such as hemodialysis, hemofiltration, plasmapheresis and immunotherapy.
