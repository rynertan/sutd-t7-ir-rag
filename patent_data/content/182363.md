# Cardiac output measurement system.

## Abstract
An apparatus for measuring cardiac output includes a first system for obtaining cardiac output based on a thermal attenuation method and a second system for obtaining blood flow velocity based on a thermal type flowrate mea surement. A constituent value is obtained from the cardiac output and blood flow velocity, and the constituent value is held. The apparatus also includes a computing unit for com puting cardiac output from the already obtained constituent value and a blood flow velocity obtained at the time of mea surement. The constituent value can be updated by starting the first system.
