# Drill bit and improved cutting element.

## Abstract
A drill bit for connection to a drill string has a bit body 2 with a cutting face 7 , which supports a plurality of cutting elements 18 . The cutting elements 18 comprise a cylin drical supporting stud 19 of sintered carbide which has a diamond cutting element 26 mounted thereon. The di amond cutting elements 26 have a novel cutting shape facilitating drilling through hard formations with a minimum of applied weight on the bit. The cutting elements 26 are in the shape of a relatively large disc shaped cutter commonly used for medium and soft formations but have the sides shaped into a cutting edge 126 of substantially smaller radius. The cutting element 26 has the strength and resistance to breakdown of the larger disc but the cutting capacity in hard formations of a smaller diameter cutter. The cutting elements 26 are also disclosed as novel compo nents of the drill.
