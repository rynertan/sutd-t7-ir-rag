Antibiotic S 31794 F 1 is an antifungal cyclic peptide of formula I wherein R is myristoyl and R1, R3 and R4 are OH and R2 is CO NH2. Each factor is isolated from the A30912 complex which contains the other factors arbitrarily designated factors B, C, D, E, F, and G. The A 30912 complex and the individual factors A through G are disclosed by M. Hoehn and K. Michel in U.S. Patent No.4,024,245. Antibiotic A 30912 factor A is identical to antibiotic A 22802 which is described by C. Higgins andK. Michel in U.S. Patent No. 4,024,246. Factor A has also been found to be identical to antibiotic echinocandin B see F. Benz et al., Helv. Chim. Acta, 57, 2459 1974 and Swiss Patent No. 568,386 and to antibiotic SL 7810 F see C. Keller Juslen et al. TetrahedronLetters, 4147 1976 and Belgium Patent No. 834,289 . Antibiotic A 30912 factor A is prepared by submerged aerobic fermentation using one of several different organisms, namely a Aspergillus rugulosusNRRL 8113 b Aspergillus nidulans NRRL 8112 c Aspergillus nidulans var. echinulatus A 32204, NRRL 3860 d Aspergillus rugulosus NRRL 8039 or e Aspergillus nidulans var. roseus NRRL 11440. Factor B has also been found to be identical to antibiotic echinocandin C see R. Traber et al.,Helv. Chim. Acta, 62, 1252 1979 and to antibiotic SL 7810 F Il see Belgium PatentNo. 834,289 . Antibiotic A 30912 factor B is prepared by submerged aerobic fermentation using one of several different organisms, namely a Aspergillus rugulosusNRRL 8113 b Aspergillus nidulans var. echinulatusA 32204, NRRL 3860 c Aspergillus rugulosus NRRL 8039 or d Aspergillus nidulans var. roseus NRRL 11440. Factor D has also been found to be identical to antibiotic echinocandin D see R. Traber et al., Helv. Chim. Acta, 62, 1252 1979L and to antibiotic SL 7810 F III see Belgium Patent No. 834,289 . Antibiotic A 30912 factor D is prepared by submerged aerobic fermentation using one of several different organisms, namely a Aspergillus rugulosusNRRL 8113 b Aspergillus nidulans var. echinulatusA 32204, NRRL 3860, c Aspergillus rugulosus NRRL 8039 see Belgian Patent No. 834,289 or d Aspergillus nidulans var. roseus NRRL 11440. Factor H is a later discovered antibioticA 30912 factor, and it is disclosed in the copending application No. 80301913.1 entitled ANTIBIOTIC A 30912 FACTOR H, Antibiotic A 30912 factor H is prepared by fermentation using one of several different organisms, namely a Aspergiuus rugulosus NRRL 8113 or b Aspergillus nidulans var. roseus NRRL 11440. A subculture of A. nidulans var. roseus has been deposited and made a part of the permanent culture collection of the Northern Regional Research Laboratory,U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural ResearchService, Peoria, Illinois 61604, from which it is available to the public under the number NRRL 11440. When a strain of A nidulans var. roseus NRRL 11440 is used to produce any one of the A 30912 factors a complex of factors is obtained which for convenience is called the A 42355 antibiotic complex. A 30912 factor A is the major factor of the A 42355 antibiotic coiplq, while factors B, D and H are minor factors.Preparations 2 to 7 herein, illustrate the preparation of the A 42355 complex and the isolation and purification of the individual A 30912 factors therefrom. In the antibiotic molecule of formula I, the linoleoyl side chain R is attached at the cyclic peptide nucleus at the a amino group of the ornithine residue. Surprisingly, it has been found that the linoleoyl side chain can be cleaved from the nucleus by an enzyme without affecting the chemical intregity of the nucleus. The enzyme employed to effect the deacylation reaction is produced by a microorganism of the family actinoplanaceae, preferably the microorganism Actinoplanes utahensis NRRL 12052, or a variant thereof. To accomplish deacylation, the appropriate antibiotic A30912 factor is added to a culture of the microorganism and the culture is allowed to incubate with the substrate until the deacylation is subtantially complete. The cyclic nucleus thereby obtained is separated from the fermentation broth by methods known in the art.Unlike the antibiotic A 30912 factors A, B, D and H, the cyclic nucleus lacking the linoleoyl side chain is substantially devoid of antifungal activity. Antibiotic S31794 F 1, which is disclosed inGerman Offenlegungschrift 2,628,965 and U.S. Patent No.4,173,629, is produced by Acrophialophora limonispora nov. spec. Dreyfuss et Muller NRRL 8095.

Antibiotic S31794 F 1 is prepared by sub merged aerobic cultivation of Acrophialophora limonisporaNRRL 8095 as described in Preparations 8 and 9. This microorganism is a part of the permanent culture collection of the Northern Regional Research Center, U.S.Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research CultureCollection, North Central Region, Peoria, Illinois 61604, from which it is available to the public under the designated NRRL number. Antibiotic S31794 F 1 has antifungal activity, particularly against Candida strains such as Candida albicans. Thus, production and isolation of the antibiotic can be monitored by bioautography using aCandida species such as Candida albicans. In the antibiotic S31794 F 1 molecule of formula I, wherein R1, R3 and R4 are all OH, and R2 is CO NH2, the myristoyl side chain R is attached at the cyclic peptide nucleus at the a amino group of the dihydroxyornithine residue. Surprisingly, it has been found that the myristoyl side chain can be cleaved from the nucleus by an enzyme without affecting the chemical integrity of the nucleus. The enzyme employed to effect thedeacplation reaction is produced by a microorganism of the family Actinoplanaceae, preferably the microorganism Actinoplanes utahensis NRRL 12052, or a variant thereof. To accomplish deacylation, antibioticS31794 F 1 is added to a culture of the microorganism and the culture is allowed to incubate with the substrate until the deacylation is subtantially complete.The cyclic nucleus thereby obtained is separated from the fermentation broth by methods known in the art.Unlike antibiotic S31794 F 1, the cyclic nucleus lacking the myristoyl side chain is substantially devoid of antifungal activity. The cyclic peptide nuclei afforded by the aforedescribed enzymatic deacylations of the antibiotics of formula I are depicted in general formula II. EMI8.1 The compound of formula II wherein R1, R3 andR4 are all OH and R2 is H is the A 30912 factor A nucleus and for convenience will be referred to herein as the A 30912A nucleus .

The compound of formula II wherein R1 andR4 are both OH, R2 is H and R3 is CH30 is the A 30912 factor H nucleus and for convenience, will be referred to herein as the A 30912H nucleus . The compound of formula II wherein R1, R3 and R4 are all OH and R is CO NH2 is the nucleus of the S 31794 F 1 antibiotic and will be referred to herein as the S 31794 F 1 nucleus . The S 31794 F 1 nucleus has an empirical formula of C35H52N8016 and a molecular weight of 840.87. Removal of the side chain group affords free primary a amino group in the ornithine residue of the cyclic peptide. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the nuclei can be obtained either in the form of the free amine or of the acid addition salt. Although any suitable acid addition salt may be employed, those which are non toxic and pharmaceutically acceptable are preferred. The method of preparing each nucleus from the appropriate antibiotic by means of fermentation usingActinoplanes utahensis NRRL 12052 is described in the co pending application of Bernard J. Abbott and David S.Fukuda, entitled CYCLIC PEPTIDE NUCLEI , Docket No. X 5399AJwhich is being filed herewith this even date. Cultures of representative species of Actinoplanaceae are available to the public from the NorthernRegional Research Laboratory under the following accession numbers Actinoplanes utahensis NRRL 12052 Actinoplanes missouriensis NRRL 12053 Actinoplanes sp. NRRL 8122 Actinoplanes sp. NRRL 12065 Streptosporangium roseum var. hollandensis NRRL 12064 The effectiveness of any given strain of microorganism within the family Actinoplanaceae for carrying out the deacylation of this invention is determined by the following procedure. A suitable growth medium is inoculated with the microorganism.The culture is incubated at about 280C. for two or three days on a rotary shaker. One of the substrate antibiotics is then added te the culture. The pH of the fermentation medium is maintained at about pH 6.5.The culture is monitored for activity using a Candida albicans assay. Loss of antibiotic activity is an indication that the microorganism produces the requisite enzyme for deacylation. This must be verified, however, using one of the following methods 1 analysis by HPLC for presence of the intact nucleus or 2 reacylation with an appropriate side chain e.g. linoleoyl, stearoyl, palmitoyl or myristoyl to restore activity. It is known that other antibiotic substances possess the same nucleus as that of antibiotic A 30912 factor A. These antibiotics differ from antibiotic A 30912 factor A in that different acyl groups are present in place of the linoleoyl group R in FormulaI. Such antibiotics are a tetrahydro A 30912 factor A tetrahydro SL 7810 F tetrahydro echinocandinB described in Belgium Patent 834,289 and by F. Benz et al., Helv. Chim. Acta, 57 2459 1974 , which compound is depicted in Formula I when R is stearoyl and b aculaecin A, which is a component of the aculaecin complex prepared by fermentation using Aspergillus aculeatus NRRL 8075 and is described by K. Mizuno et al., in U.S. Patent 3,978,210. As is discussed inBelgium Patent 859,067, in aculaecin A the palmitoyl side chain is present in place of linoleoyl. Tetrahydro A 30912 factor A can be prepared from antibioticA 30912 factor A by catalytic hydrogenation using PtO2 in ethanol under positive pressure. Both tetrahydroA 30912 factor A and aculaecin A can be employed as substrates for the enzymatic deacylation using the procedures herein described. It is also known that another antibiotic substance possesses the same nucleus as that of antibiotic A 30912 factor B. This substance, which differs from antibiotic A 30912 factor B in that a different acyl group is present in place of the linoleoyl group R in Formula I, is tetrahydro A 30912 factor B tetrahydro SL 7810 F II tetrahydro echinocandin C described by R. Traber et al., Helv. Chim. Acta, 62 1252 1979 . Tetrahydro A 30912 factor B is depicted in Formula I when R is stearoyl. Tetrahydro A 30912 factor B can be prepared from antibiotic A 30912 factor B by catalytic hydrogenation using PtO2 in ethanol under positive pressure. Tetrahydro A 30912 factor B can be employed as a substrate in place of antibioticA 30912 factor B for the enzymatic deacylation using the procedures herein described. Additionally, it is knows that another antibiotic substance possesses the same nucleus as that of antibiotic A 30912 factor D. This substance, which differs from antibiotic A 30912 factor D in that a different acyl group is present in place of the linoleoyl group R in Formula I, is tetrahydro A 30912 factor D tetrahydro SL 7810 F III tetrahydro echinocandin D described by R. Traber et al., Helv. Chim. Acta, 62 1252 1979 . Tetrahydro A 30912 factor B is depicted in Formula r when R is stearoyl.

In antibiotic A 30912 factor H, the 5 hydroxyl group present in the dihydroxy ornithine residue of the peptide nucleus is methylated, while in antibiotic A 30912 factor A, the 5 hydroxyl group is unsubstituted. It will be recognized, therefore, that factor H can be made synthetically by methylating factor A using methods that are conventional for preparing an aliphatic ether from an alcohol. It will also be recognized that Factor A can be alkylated with other lower alkyl groups to form alkyloxy homologs of the factor H molecule. The alkyloxy homologs of FactorH, which can be prepared synthetically from factor A, are known as the A 30912 factor H type homologs. The compound of formula II wherein R1 and R4 are both OH, R2 is H and R3 is C2 C6 alkyloxy are herein referred to as the A 30912H type nuclei . It will also be apparent that the linoleoyl side chain of the A 30912 factor H or of the A 30912 factor H type homologs can be hydrogenated using conventional techniques to provide tetrahydro A 30912 factor H or the corresponding tetrahydro derivative of the alkyloxy homologs R is stearoyl . Alternatively, the tetrahydro derivatives can be made by first hydrogenating antibiotic A 30912 factor A to give tetrahydro A 30912 factor A and then forming the desired alkyloxy derivative therefrom. It will be understood that antibiotic A 30912 factor H, tetrahydro A 30912 factor H, a C2 C6 alkyloxy homolog of factor H, or a tetrahydro derivative of aC2 C6 alkyloxy homolog of factor H can be employed as a substrate for the enzymatic deacylation using the procedures herein described.

The compounds of Formula III inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungi as evidenced by standard biological test procedures. The compounds are useful, therefore, for controlling the growth of fungi on environmental surfaces as an antiseptic or in treat ig infections caused by fungi. The antifungal activity of the compounds has been demonstrated against Candida albicans in vitro in agar plate disc diffusion tests or agar tube dilution tests, or in vivo in tests in mice infected with C. albicans. Thus, the compounds are particularly useful in treating infections caused by strains of C. albicans candidosis . The compounds ofFormula III have also shown activity in vitro in agarplate disc diffusion tests against Trichophyton mentagrophytes, a dermatophytic organism.Activity has also been found in in vitro agar plate disc diffusion tests against Saccharomyces pastorianus, and Neurospora crassa.

A preferred method for preparing the compounds of Formula III is by the active ester method. The use of the 2,4,5 trichlorophenyl ester of the desired side chain acid Formula IV as the acylating agent is most preferred. In this method, an excess amount of the active ester is reacted with the nucleus at room temperature in a non reactive organic solvent such as dimethylformamide DMF . The reaction time is not critical, although a time of about 24 to about 120 hours is preferred. At the conclusion of the reaction, the solvent is removed, and the residue is purified by chromatography, such as over silica gel using ethyl acetate methanol 3 2, v v as the eluent, or by reversed phase HPLC using silica gel C18 reversed phase resin as the stationary phase and a mixture of H20 CH3OH CH3CN as the solvent system. The 2,4,5 trichlorophenyl esters are conveniently made by treating the side chain acid FormulaIV with 2,4,5 trichlorophenol in the presence of a coupling agent, such as ,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Other methods of preparation of the active esters will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The substituted acids of Formula IV, and the activated derivatives thereof, are either known compounds or they can be made from known compounds by methods known in the art. The benzoic, phenylalkylcarboxylic, phenylalkenylcarboxylic, phenoxyalkylcarboxylic, phenoxyalkenylcarboxylic, phenylthioalkylcarboxylic, phenylthioalkenylcarboxylic, phenylsulfinylalkylcarboxylic, phenylsulfinylalkenylcarboxylic, phenylsulfonylalkylcarboxylic, phenylsulfonylalkenylcarboxylic, pyridinylcarboxylic, pyridinylalkylcarboxylic, and pyridinylalkenylcarboxylic acids of Formula IV are prepared by similar procedures. To illustrate these procedures, a discussion of the preparation of the benzoic acid subgroup is provided. The alkoxybenzoic acids or alkenyloxybenzoic acids can be prepared conveniently from an appropriate hydroxybenzoic acid by reacting an appropriate alkyl or alkenyl halide with the disodium salt of the appropriate hydroxybenzoic acid. The alkylthio benzoic acids or the alkenylthio benzoic acids can be prepared conveniently by treating the appropriate substituted S 4carbomethoxyphenyl dimethylthiocarbamate of the general formula 2C6H3XS CO N CH3 2 with aqueous sodium hydroxide at 65 85eC, then adding the appropriate alkyl or alkenyl bromide, and continuing heating for 2 4 hours. The substituted S 4 carbomethoxyphenyl dimethylthiocarbamates can be made from the appropriate hydroxybenzoic acids by the method of 14. Newman and H. Wanes, G. Org. Chem., 31, 3980 1966 . When it is desired to prepare a compound ofFormula III wherein A is sulfinyl or sulfonyl, the appropriate sulfoxide or sulfone derivative of the alkenylthio or alkylthio benzoic acid Formula IV can be employed for acylation of the nucleus. The appropriate sulfoxides or sulfones can be made by oxidation of the corresponding thioether compound using conventional agents, such as m chloroperbenzoic acid, t butylhypochlorite, sodium metaperiodate, or hydrogen peroxide. If a double bond is present in the thioether, very mild conditions should be employed to avoid epoxidation. If equimolar amounts of reactants are taken, the product is a sulfoxide A is sulfinyl , which is readily oxidized to the sulfone A is sulfonyl by an additional mole of the oxidizing agent.The hydroxybenzoic acids and substituted derivatives thereof used as starting material in the processes described herein are either known compounds or can be prepared by conventional methods which are known in the art. When employed systemically, the dosage of the compounds of Formula III will vary according to the particular compound being employed, the severity and nature of the infection, and the physical condition of the subject being treated. Therapy should be initiated at low dosages, the dosage being increased until the desired antifungal effect is obtained. The compounds can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly by injection in the form of a sterile aqueous solution or suspension to which may be added, if desired, various conventional pharmaceutically acceptable preserving, buffering, solubilizing, or suspending agents. Other additives, such as saline or glucose may be added to make the solutions isotonic. The proportions and nature of such additives will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Certain compounds of Formula III give significant blood levels after oral administration seeExample 1, Table 9 and can be administered systemically by the oral route. For oral use, such compounds can be administered in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients in the form of capsules, tablets or powders. The nature and proportion of such carriers or excipients will be recognized by those skilled in. the art. When employed to treat vaginal candida infections, the compounds of Formula III can be administered in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable conventional excipients suitable for intravaginal use. Formulations adapted for intravaginal administration will be known to those skilled in the art.

Preparation 10Preparation of Silica Gel C18 Reversed Phase ResinStep 1 Hydrolysis LP 1 silica gel 1000 g from Quantum Corp., now Whatman is added to a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid 1650 ml and concentrated nitric acid 1650 ml in a 5 L round bottom flask and shaken for proper suspension. The mixture is heated on a steam bath overnight 16 hours with a water jacketed condenser attached to the flask. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath and carefully filtered using a sintered glass funnel. The silica gel is washed with deionized water until the pH is neutral. The silica gel is then washed with acetone 4 L and dried under vacuum at 1000C. for 2 days. Step 2 First Silylation The dry silica gel from Step 1 is transferred to a round bottom flask and suspended in toluene 3.5 L . The flask is heated on a steam bath for 2 hours to azeotrope off some residual water.Octadecyltrichlorosilane 321 ml, Aldrich ChemicalCompany is added, and the reaction mixture is refluxed overnight 16 hours with slow mechanical stirring at about 600C. Care is taken so that the stirrer does not reach near the bottom of the flask.This is to prevent grinding the silica gel particles. The mixture is allowed to cool. The silanized silica gel is collected, washed with toluene 3 L and acetone 3 L , and then air dried overnight 16 20 hours . The dried silica gel is suspended in 3.5 L of acetonitrile water 1 1 in a 5 L flask, stirred carefully at room temperature for 2 hours, filtered, washed with acetone 3 L and air dried overnight.Step 3 Second Silylation The procedure from the first silylation is repeated using 200 ml of octadecyltrichlorosilane.The suspension is ref fluxed at 600C. for 2 hours while stirring carefully. The final product is recovered by filtration, washed with toluene 3 L and methanol 6L , and then dried under vacuum at 500C. overnight 16 20 hours . Preparation 11 Slurry Packing Procedure for Michel Miller ColumnsGeneral Information This procedure is employed for packing silica gel C18 reversed phase resin such as that prepared by the method of Preparation 10. Generally, a pressure of less than 200 psi and flow rates between 5 40 ml minute are required for this slurry packing technique this is dependent on column volume and size. Packing pressure should exceed the pressure used during actual separation by 30 50 psi this will assure no further compression of the adsorbent during separation runs. A sudaen decrease in pressure may cause cracks or channels to form in the packing material, which would greatly reduce column efficiency. Therefore, it is important to let the pressure drop slowly to zero whenever the pump is turned off. The approximate volume of columns Ace GlassCat. No., unpacked are No. 5795 04, 12 ml No. 5795 10, 110 ml No. 5795 16, 300 ml No. 5795 24, 635 ml andNo. 5796 34, 34 ml. The time required to pack a glass column will vary from minutes to several hours depending on column size and the experience of the scientist.Steps 1. Connect glass column to a reservoir column via coupling volume of reservoir column should be twice that of the column . Place both columns in vertical positions reservoir column above . 2. Weigh out packing material ca. 100 g for 200 ml column .3. Add ca. five volumes of solvent to packing material use a mixture of 70 80 methanol and 20 308 water.4. Shake well until all particles are wetted, let stand overnight or longer to assure complete soaking of particles by solvent. Decant supernatant liquid.5. Slurry the resin with sufficient solvent to fill reservoir column. Pour swiftly into reservoir. The column must be pre filled with the same solvent and the reservoir column should be partly filled with solvent before slurry is poured. The use of larger slurry volumes may also provide good results however, this will require a larger reservoir or b multiple reservoir fillings during the packing procedure.6. Close reservoir with the Teflon plug beneath the column see Figure 1 of U.S. Patent 4,131,547, plugNo. 3 connect to pump and immediately start pumping solvent through system at maximum flow rate if AceCat. No. 13265 25 Pump or similar solvent delivery system is used ca. 20 ml minute . 7. Continue until column is completely filled with adsorbent. Pressure should not exceed maximum tolerance of column during this operation ca. 200 psi for large columns and 300 psi for analytical columns . In most cases, pressures less than 200 psi will be sufficient.8. Should pressure exceed maximum values, reduce flow rate pressure will drop. 9. After column has been filled with adsorbent, turn off pump let pressure drop to zero disconnect reservoir replace reservoir with a pre column fill pre column with solvent and small amount of adsorbent and pump at maximum pressure until column is completely packed. For additional information, see general procedure. Always allow pressure to decrease slowly after turning off pump this will prevent formation of any cracks or channels in the packing material.10. Relieve pressure and disconnect pre column carefully. With small spatula remove a few mm 2 4 of packing from top of column place 1 or 2 filter s in top of column gently depress to top of packing material, and.place Teflon plug on top of column until seal is confirmed. Connect column to pump, put pressure on usually less than 200 psi and observe through glass wall on top of column if resin is packing any further. If packing material should continue to settle this may be the case with larger columns , some dead space or channelling will appear and step 9 should be repeated.
