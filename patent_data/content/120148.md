## Description
UNDERGROUND BACKFILL FOR MAGNESIUM ANODES The invention resides in a backfill composition for use with underground placement of magnesium galvanic anodes, said composition comprising a mixture of calcium sulfite and bentonite, wherein said bentonite contains a substantial amount of alkaline earth metal bentonite. In the cathodic protection of ferrous structures, especially pipelines, the use of a mixture of alkali bentonite, gypsum and sodium sulfate as a backfill for underground magnesium base anodes is well known, the particulars of which are shown in the patents listed below. It is noted that among the teachings in the patents it is taught that alkali bentonite is the operable form of bentonite, but that 11alkaline earth bentonite is inoperable. U.S. 2,478,479 discloses a magnesium base alloy on a Mg Al alloy core, buried in a backfill of bentonite gypsum mixture, for galvanic protection of a ferrous metal pipeline. U.S. 2,480,087 discloses a backfill consisting of naturally occurring bentonite in admixture with gypsum and a water soluble metal salt, such as sodium sulfate. The operable bentonite is said to be alkali bentonite in contradistinction to alkaline earth bentonite which is said to be inoperable. U.S. 2,525,665 2,527,361, and 2,567,855 disclose gypsum bentonite sodium sulfate backfills such as is described in U.S 2,480,087 above. U.S. 2,601,214 discloses a backfill comprising a major proportion of magnesium sulfite and a minor proportion of sodium typeH bentonite montmorillonite . A reference for mineralogical information about bentonite clays, and other clays of the montmorillonite type, is Applied Clay Mineralogy by Ralph E.Grim, published by McGraw Hill Book Company, Inc., NewYork, 1962. As used in this application the term bentonite is used in referring to minerals which are largely composed of montmorrillonite clays such as are mined as alterations of volcanic ash, and the like. Alkali metal bentonites e.g., sodium bentonite are known to swell upon addition of water, and to contract or de swell upon removal of water, in contradistinction to alkaline earth metal bentonites e.g., calcium bentonite which undergo little, if any, such swelling or de swelling, thus maintaining good contact with the surrounding soil. In accordance with the invention, bentonite clays containing a substantial amount, preferably a major amount, of alkaline earth metal bentonite, e.g., calcium bentonite, admixed with calcium sulfite, is used as a back fill material for underground installations of galvanic magnesium anodes far the cathodic protection of ferrous metal structures, e.g., pipelines.Preferably, the backfill material also contains at least one compound selected from sodium sulfite, boric acid, B OH 3, sodium alkylates or sodium dialkyldithiocarbomates. As stated above, the bentonites of the present invention are those which contain a substantial amount of the alkaline earth metal variety, especially the calcium bentonite variety. A It substantial amount is that amount which substantially, and beneficially, reduces the swelling and de swelling properties of the bentonite as the water content is increased or decreased, respectively. Preferably, the bentonite contains a major amount about 50 or more of the calcium bentonite variety. The variety of alkaline earth metal bentonites, mined and identified as calcium bentonite, is largely of that variety, though it may contain minor amounts of other forms of bentonite type clays.It is within the purview of the present invention to blend calcium bentonite with the commonly used sodium bentonite to provide in the blend a substantial amount, preferably about 50 or more, of the calcium bentonite. The calciam bentonite may be, but does not need to be, mixed with, or diluted with, the sodium bentonite variety. Along with the Ca bentonite there is used an appreciable amount of calcium sulfite CaSO3 instead of the gypsum calcium sulfate which is commonly used with the Na bentonite clays as a backfill for Mg anodes.MgSO3 may be used in place of part or all of the CaS03, but is not preferred. An optional, but sometimes preferred ingredient, for use with the Ca bentonite CaSO3 mixtures, is at least one compound selected from sodium sulfite Na2SO3 , boric acid B OH 31 sodium alkylates or sodium dialkyldithiocarbomates. This sodium sulfite additive is especially beneficial where the mixture needs to enhance anode current capacity. Other alkali metal sulfites, e.g., Li2SO3 or K2SO3, may be used along with or in place of the Na2SO3. The sodium alkylates conform essentially with the empirical formula R COONa, where R is an alkyl moiety of 1 4 carbons, preferably methyl. The sodium dialkyldithiocarbamates conform essentially with the empirical formula R NR CS SNa, where each R is an alkyl moiety of from 1 4 carbons, preferably ethyl.These additives, especially in a moist backfill composition, will be in a hydrated form. Preferably at least one of each of the above sodium salt acids will be used in the same backfill formulation, such as sodium acetate along with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate.These sodium salt acids, whether used singly or in combinations, comprise up to about 25 by weight of the total solids in the backfill, preferably from 3 to 22 . An especially preferred mixture of ingredients comprises a mixture of CaSO3, Ca bentonite, sodium acetate, and sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, wherein the ratio of CaSO3 Ca bentonite is about 2.5 and in which the sodium acetate comprises from 6 to 7 of the total weight of the solids and the sodium diethyldithiocarbamate comprises from 3 to 15 of the total weight of the solids. Metal salts e.g., K, Li, etc. of these acids, other than sodium salts are within the purview of the present invention, but the sodium salts are generally more readily obtained and are preferred. The magnesium anodes, with which the present novel backfills are used, may be any of those compositions or alloys wherein the principal sacrificial metal is magnesium. Among the Mg anodes which have been commercially popular are those wherein the Mg contains small percents of Mn, Al, and or Zn alloyed therewith, along with impurities normally found in Mg. The present novel backfills are useable with any of the magnesium anodes. In contradistinction to sacrificial aluminum anodes, where halide ions in the backfill are often desired to disrupt the passivating effect of Al OH 3 formed on the Al anode, Mg anodes tend to suffer accelerated and wasted corrosion if halide ions are added to the backfill. In the customary manner of providing backfills for underground installations of Mg anodes, the present backfills may be packed around anodes placed in holes in the ground or may be packaged around the anodes before being installed in the holes. The backfill may be wetted with water either before or after being installed in the ground. Preferably, the present backfills are utilized in packaged arrangements, wherein the anode is encompassed in the backfill, whereby the entire package is installed in the ground, wired electrically from the core of the anode to the metal structure to be protected, and water is added to wet usually saturate the backfill.The packaged material is contained in a water permeable material, generally cloth and or paper. It its not generally necessary that the water permeable material retain any substantial strength after prolonged or repeated wettings. when packaged materials are placed into a hole, the void spaces remaining in the hole are to be filled in with earth or additional backfill material.It is generally best if the earth or additional backfill is slurried in water and poured in so as to be certain that no void spaces remain around the package. In very damp or wet soil, the packaged material will become wetted naturally, but in dry or well drained soils, it is preferred to add water to achieve a good initial voltage in the installation. In contradistinction to other sacrificial anodes using conventional backfills, or no backfills, where one is likely to encounter accelerated corrosion and a subsequent loss of current capacity, Mg anodes imbedded in the present backfill material usually exhibit not only increased current capacity, but may also exhibit increased operating potentials. The amount of Ca bentonite variety in the bentonite mineral for use in the present invention, in order to have an appreciable reduced effect on the swelling de swelling of the backfill mixture, should comprise, preferably about 50 or more of the bentonite component virtually all of the bentonite component may be of the Ca bentonite variety. The ratio of CaSO3 bentonite is preferably in the range of from 0.2 to 5.0. At percentages outside this range, the mixture performs substantially as bentonite on the one hand, or as CaSO3 on the other.Most preferably, the range of ratios for CaSO3 bentonite is from 0.5 to 4.0. The amount of Na2SO3 which may be optionally used may comprise, on a solids basis, about zero to about 50 of the total, preferably about 20 to about 40 . The amount of B OH 3 which is added may comprise, on a weight basis, up to about 16 percent of the total, preferably from 0.2 to 6 , most preferably from 0.5 to 5 . It will be recognized by skilled Mg anode artisans that the half cell potential for a Mg alloy is usually well below the theoretical potential calculated from the electromotive series for that alloy. Even in a large masterbatch of molten Mg alloy, the many anodes which are cast therefrom may exhibit a range of half cell potentials measured in a constant screen test environment.Differences in amount of impurities, oxidation, heat history, and other variables can cause a significant spread of tested potentials in the cast anodes. Then when the anodes are installed in various backfills, it may be found that some of them exhibit lower performance than that achieved in the standard screening test while some may perform better. With the present novel backfills, as with previously used backfills, the installations along a pipeline or other ferrous structure should take into account the soil composition, its moisture content, and its resistivity, including its drainage characteristics.With knowledge of the soil conditions and with knowledge of the expected operating potential and current capacity of the anode in a given backfill intelligent placement of the anodes can be made, each anode protecting a calculated area of the ferrous structure.EXPERIMENTAL In the Examples given below, the Mg anodes tested were machined rods 15.24 cm 6 in length and 1.59 cm 5 8 in diameter. The Mg anode pencils contained about 1.03 1.31 Mn, with trace amounts of impurities of about 0.0023 0.0034 Al, about 0.0015 010020 Cu, about 0.018 0.034 Fe, and about 0.0003 0.0005 Ni. The tests were made in testing cans made of carbon steel, 17.8 cm 7 tall by 10.2 cm 4 I.D. the inside bottom of the can was covered with a thin layer of epoxy resin to minimize end effects.The candidate backfill was poured into the can, the pre weighed anode pencils were centrally positioned in the backfill, through holes in a rubber stopper, there being about 8.9 to 10.2 cm 3.5 4.0 of the anode immersed in the backfill. The test cans were connected in series to a rectifier having a copper coulometer in the circuit. The current density used was 3.35 mA m2 36 mA ft.2 and periodic potential readings were taken using a saturated colomel reference electrode SCE . The test duration was from 2 to 6 weeks. A cleaning solution consisting of 25 chromic acid solution 500C was used to clean the anodes for re weighing to calculate weight loss. Current capacity of the Mg anode was determined from the knowledge of the weight gain of the coulometer cathode and the anode weight loss. For comparison or control purposes, variousMg anode specimens were tested in saturated CaSO4 solution they were found to exhibit a mean initial potential of 1.5585d 0.0065 volt , a mean final potential of 1.539t0.018 volt , and a mean current capacity of 968t72.6 amp. hrs. per Kg. 440i33 amp.hrs. per lb. . The following examples employedCa bentonite along with CaSO3 at various ratios, along with Na2 SO3 added to provide an amount ranging from 0 to 40 of the total weight based on solids . The more soluble ingredient was dissolved in 500 ml. water to the extent of its solubility. About 500 gm. of the specified ingredients were used and well mixed before placing in the test can. Example I A CaSO3 Ca bentonite mixture, at a CaSO3 Ca bentonite ratio of 0.5, without Na2SO3 added, exhibited an initial closed circuit potential of 1.04 volts , a final potential of 1.575 volts , and a current capacity of 913 amp. hrs per Kg. 415 amp. hrs. per lb. .
