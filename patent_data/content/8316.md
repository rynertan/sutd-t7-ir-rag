# A fabric reel for plush fabrics.

## Abstract
The reel is constructed with a pair of end frames 12 , each of which is provided with elongated apertures 28 in the end boards 16 . The apertures 28 permit viewing of the contents of the reel 10 when the reel is mounted in a horizontal storage position. The apertures 28 also provide a manual means for grasping of the reel 10 in order to remove the reel from a shipping carton 36 . The hook containing strips 15 of each end frame 12 terminate short of the corners of the cardboard 16 to mount the reel contents in a slightly sus pended condition in a shipping carton 36 .
