# Core containing amorphous ferromagnetic strip material.

## Abstract
The core includes a number of concentric turns of a ferromagnetic strip material. An inner core portion 13 consists of a non amorphous material and an outer core portion 27 consists of an amorphous material. The transi tion between the two core portions 13, 27 is formed by a welded joint between the overlapping outer 17 and inner 15 end portions of the outer turn of the inner core portion 13 , with the inner end portion 19 of the inner turn 33 of the outer core portion 27 disposed therebetween.
