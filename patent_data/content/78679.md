# An electrode connection structure in a semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A compact connection structure between two elec trodes made of two types of metals, i.e., metals which respectively make Schottky and ohmic contact with a semiconductor, is provided by using a high melting point metal or silicide thereof which makes Schottky contact with a semiconductor as one electrode metal 13b 22 . These two types of electrodes 13b 22, 23 can be brought into direct contact with each other, enabling elimination of through hole connections between them and therefore increased semiconductor device density.
