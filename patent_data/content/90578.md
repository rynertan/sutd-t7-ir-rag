# A41030 antibiotics and their production.

## Abstract
Antibiotic A41030, a complex of 7 individual factors, is produced by submerged, aerobic fermentation of new Streptomy ces virginiae NRRL 12525, and Streptomyces virginiae NRRL 15156. The antibiotic factors are separated and possess anti bacterial activity against Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species which are penicillin resistant. The complex and the individual factors also enhance feed efficiency in ruminant ani mals, and are growth promoters in chickens and swine, and are especially valuable in milk production in dairy cattle.

## Description
A41030 ANTIBIOTICS AND THEIR PRODUCTION This invention relates to novel fermentation products having antimicrobial properties and to the method of preparing those antibiotics by cultivation of a previously unknown microorganism of the Stretomyces family. These new compounds are similar to the antibiotics described in U. S. Patent Nos. 4,322,343 and 4,322,406. There is a great need to develop new antibiotics because of the great possibility and constant threat that antibiotic specific resistant strains of pathogenic microorganisms will emerge. In particular, pathogens within the gram positive generaStaphylococcus and Streptococcus often are resistant to commonly used antibiotica such as penicillin and erythromycin see for example, W. O. Foye, Principles of Medicinal.Chemistrv, pp. 584 686 1974 . In accordance with the invention, the A41030 complex and its Factors A, B, C, D, E, F, and G or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, have been found to be effective antimicrobial agents. These new antibiotics can be prepared by aerobic fermentation of the previously undescribed microorganism, Streptomyces virginiae NRRL 12525, or its parent, Streptomyces virginiae NRRL 15156, in a culture medium containing assimilable sources of carbon, nitrogen and inorganic salts. These organisms and others produce an antibiotic complex comprising several antibiotic reactors, including those designated as Factors A, B, C, D, E, F and G. For convenience, the cultured microorganism, Streptomyces virginiae NRRL 12525, has been designated in cur laboratory as cultureA41030.4. Streptomyces virginiae NRRL 15156 has been designated In our laboratory as A41030. The infrared absorption spectra of the individual factors are presented in the accompanying drawings as follows Figure 1 A410 0 factor A in tr pellet Figure 2 A41030 factor B in R3r pellet wiaure 3 A41030 factor C in KBr pellet Figure 4 A41030 factor D in KBr peilet Figure 5 A41030 factor E in RBr pellet Figure 6 A41030 factor F in KBr pellet Figure 7 A41030 factor G in KBr pellet The term complex , as used in the fermen taticn art, and in tis specification, refers to a mixture of produced individual antibiotic factors.As will be reccgnized by those familiar with antibiotic production by fermentation, the number and ratio of the individual factors produced in an antibiotic complex will vary, depending upon the fermentation conditions and the strain used. Culture A41030., a chemically induced mutant of a strain of the Streptomyces virginiae A41030 culture which was initially isolated from a scil sample collected in Indianapolis, Indiana, was deposited on ath September 1981 and made a part of the stock culture collection of the Northern Regional ResearchCenter, U.S. Department of Agriculture, AgriculturalResearch Service, Peoria, Illinois 61604, from which it is available to the public under the number NRRL 12525. The complexproducing parent culture, Streptomyces virginiae A41030 was deposited also at the Northern RegionalResearch Center on 22nd September 1982 and is publicly available under the accession number NRRL 15156. Culture A41030.4 was obtained bv treatment of culture A41030 sequentially with mitomycin C and thenN methyl N nitro N nitrosoguanidine. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that it would be possible to generate additional strains which have essentially the same biosynthetic capabilities as Streptomyces virginiae NRRL 12525, by subjecting culture A41030 to other mutagenic treatments. In addition to mitomycin C, other suitable agents include acriflavines, acridine orange, ethidium bromide, and similar chemical agents. Although N methyl N nitro N nitrosoguanidine was used, along with mitomycin C, to obtain NRRL 12525, other known mutagens such as ultraviolet, high frequency, and radioactive radiations, X rays and other chemical agents could be used to induce a similar mutagenesis. A41030 is classified as a strain of Streotomyces virginiae, and culture A41030.4 is classified as a chemically induced mutant cf a strain of Streptomyces virginiae, based upon a simulataneous culturing of Streptomyces avidinii ATCC 27419 Streptomyces columbiensis ATCC 27425 Streptomyces geschikensis ATCC 23914 Streptomyces griseolavendusATCC 25457 Streotomvces lavendulae ATCC So64 Streptomyces toxytricini ATCC 19813 and Streptomyces virginiae, Grundy, Whitman, Rdzok, Hanes and Sylvester 1952, ATCC 19817. The methods and media recommended byShirling and Gottlieb Methods of Characterization ofStreptomyces Species, Tnt. J. Syst.Bacteriol. 16 3 , 313 340 1966 , along with certain supplementary tests were used. Culture A41030.4 was also compared with published descriptions of the above named strains appearing in Bergey s Manual of DeterminativeBacteriology 8th Edition, edited by R.E. Buchanan andN.E. Gibbons, The Williams and Wilkins Co., Baltimore,Maryland and by Shirling and Gottlieb, CooperativeDescription of Type Strains of Streptomyces , Int. J.Syst. Bacteriol. 18 2 , 178 1968 . Since Culture A41030.4 produces no aerial mycelia and no spores on any medium, it differs from all the above named species.CHARACTERIZATION OF THE A41030 AND A41030.4 CULTURESMorphology A41030 produces well developed aerial mycelia and sporophores which are both coiled and exhibit hooks and loops. A41030 is placed in the spirales s section of Pudham et al., A Guide for theClassification of Streptomycetes According to SelectedGroups , Appl. Microbiol. 6, 52 79 1957 , as a primary morphology type, and in the Tetinaculum Apertum RA section of Pridham et al. as a secondary morphology type. A41030.4 produces no aerial mycelia and no spores.

Most of the antibiotic activity is found in the broth, while minor amounts of antibiotic activity may be associated with the mycelia. The A41030 complex is most readily separated from the fermentation mixture by removal of the mycelia, i.e., the biomass, by filtration. The mycelia generally are discarded.The antibiotic complex. is then isolated from the filtered fermentation broth preferably by column chromatography, ove a suitable adsorbent using for example methanol water 1 1 as the eluting agent. Suitable adsorbents include carbon, alumina, anion and cation exchange resins, silica gel, polyamide, carboxymetbylcelluloses, highly porous copolymers of styrene and divinylbenzene such as DiaionHP 20, the Amberlite XAD resins, and the Duolite resins such as ES 865 and the like, as well as Sephadex resins, the hydrophilic, insoluble, molecular sieve chromatographic mediums made by cross linking dextran, and also TSK Gels. The Diaion resins are a product ofMitsubishi Chemical Industries, Limited, Tokyo, Japan.The Amberlite XAD resins are produced by Rohm and Haas,Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Duolite resins are products of Diamond Shamrock, Redwood City, California.Sephadex resins are manufactured by Pharmacia FineChemicals AB, Uppsala, Sweden. The TSK Gels are available from E. Merck, Darmstadt, and from Bio Rad, 2200 Wright Ave., Richmond, California, 94804. The A41030 antibiotic complex can be purified further and separated into its individual factors by chromatographic techniques. A number of different media may be used withStreptomyces virginiae NRRL 2525 or S. virinia NRRL 15156, to produce the A41030 complex. For economy in production, optimal yield, and ease of productIsolation, however, certain culture media are preferred. These media should contain assimilable sources of carbon, nitrogen, and inorganic salts. Suitable carbon sources include dextrin, starch, mannose, glycerol, and cottonseed oil. Optimum levels of carbon sources are from about 2 to about 3 percent bv weight. Preferred nitrogen sources include soybean grits, soybean flour, peanut meal, fish meal, meat peptone, and pork blood meal. Essential trace elements necessary for the growth and development of the organism may occur as impurities in other constituents of the media in amounts sufficient to meet the growth and biosynthetic requirements of the organism. However, it may be beneficial tc incorporate in the culture media additional soluble nutrient inorganic salts capable of yielding sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, ammonium, chloride, carbonate, phosphate, sulfate, nitrate and like ions. Addition to the fermentation medium ofTween 80 oily liquid polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate, a product of ICI Americas, Inc., Wilmington,Del. , at a level of 2 4 serves to increase the yield by about 300 . However, difficulty is experienced in isolating the A41030 antibiotic under these conditions. Although small quantities of the A41030 antibiotic may be obtained by shake flask culture, submerged aerobic fermentation in tanks is preferred for producing substantial quantities of the A41030 antibiotic. For tank fermentation, it is preferable to use a vegetative inoculum. The vegetative inoculum is prepared by inoculating a small volume of culture medium with the spore form, or mycelial fragments, to obtain a fresh, actively growing culture of the organism. The vegetative inoculum is then transferred to a larger tank where, after a suitable incubation time, the A41030 antibiotic is produced in optimal yield. An alternate method of providing inoculum for the vegetative medium consists of substituting a lyophilized pellet for the aqueous spore suspension. Lyophllized pellets are prepared in a manner known in the art. Preparation of the spore suspension for lyophilization is similar to the preparation of the aqueous spore suspension, except that sterile calf serum is substituted for sterile distilled water. The A41030 producing organism can be grown over a broad temperature range of from about 10 to about 340C. Optimum production of A41030 antibiotic complex appears to occur at a temperature of about 300C. As is customary in aerobic submerged culture processes, sterile air is dispersed through the culture medium. For efficient growth of the organism, the volume of the air used in tank production is in the range of from about 0.1 to about 0.5 volumes of air per volume of culture medium per minute v v m , with from about 100 to about 300 RPM agitation. An optimum rate in a 165 liter vessel containing 100 liters of fermentation medium is about 0.25 v v m, with agitation provided by an impeller rotating at about 200 RPM. Antibiotic activity generally is present after about 48 hours and remains present for at least 144 hours during the fermentation period. Peak antibiotic production occurs at from about 96 hours to about 120 hours fermentation time. Production of the A41030 antibiotic can be monitored during the fermentation by either agar diffusion using B. subtilis, or a turbidimetric method musing Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9114. The antibiotic complex, and individual factors thereof, provided by this invention are produced by either S. virginiae NRRL 15156 or S.virginiae NRRL 12525 under rermentation conditions of temperature, duration, and media ingredients which are substantially equivalent. However, it appears that under such conditions, S. virginiae NRRL 12525 produces the antibiotic complex in somewhat greater abundance. In order to illustrate more fully the invention, the following non limiting Examples are provided. Example 1Preparation of First Stage Inoculum The following medium was prepared for use in the agar slant culture of Streptomyces virginiae NRRL 12525 and Streptomyces virginiae NRRL 15156 Ingredient Amount gIL.

The pH of the medium as prepared was 6.5, and was adjusted to 7.3 using 5 N aqueous sodium hydroxide before autoclaving. After autoclaving, the pH of the medium was 6.9. The spores of each microorganism were inoculated on an agar slant made up of the above identified ingredients, and this slant was incubated for about six days at a temperature of about 300C. The mature slant culture was then covered with sterile distilled water and scraped with a sterile tool to loosen the spores and the mycelium. One milliliter of the resulting spore suspension was used to inoculate 50 ml. of vegetative medium. An alternate method of providing inoculum for the vegetative medium consisted of substituting a lyophilized pellet for the aqueous spore suspension.The composition of the vegetative medium for NRRL 12525 was as follows ingredient Amount q L. Glucose 20.0Soybean grits or soybean flour 15.0Corn steep liquor 10.0CaCO3 2.0Tap water q.s. to 1 liter The composition of the vegetative medium forNRRL 15156 was as follows Ingredient Amount git.

The pH of the medium after autoclaving was 7.0. Each vegetative inoculum was incubated in a 250 ml. wide mouth Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 ml.of medium at about 300C. for about 48 hours on a shaker rotating through an arc 2 inches in diameter at 250 RPM. This incubated medium is used either to inoculate small fermenters the inoculum being approximately 1 per volume of fermenter medium or to inoculate a second stage medium having the same composition as the vegetative medium for the production of a larger volume of culture. Fermentation of NRRL 15156 Fifty milliliters of a production medium was inoculated with 1 0.5 ml. of the incubated vegetative medium from above.

Elution was performed with methanol water 1 1 at the rate of 6 L. min., collecting 100 L. fractions. Each fraction was analyzed for biological activity. The bioassay was performed by a paper disc assay on agar plates seeded with Bacillus subtilis. Fraction 1 was discarded.Fractions 2 15, inclusive, were combined, concentrated under reduced pressure, and the concentrate lyophilized to give 220 g. of crude antibiotic complex. A portion of this complex, 110 g., was dissolved in 5 L. of methanol water 1 1 , by adjustment to pH 10 with aqueous sodium hydroxide, and the mixture was filtered.

The LD50 of each of the antibiotic A41030 factors A, B, and C, has been determined in mice as being 300 mg. kg., when administered intraperitoneally. The in vivo oral activity of each of the antibiotic A41030 factors A, B, and C, as determined against S. pyogenes in mice, is 300 mg. kg. X 2. In one of its aspects this invention provides a method for treating infections in a warm blooded animal which comprises administering to said animal a chemotherapeutically effective amount, for example between about 25 mg. and about 2,000 mg., of the A41030 antibiotic complex or factor thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Factor A, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, can be used in the treatment of infections in man, but in general, the complex and other factors, and salts thereof, are best suited for use in the treatment of infections in other warm blooded animals. In the treatment of infections in man the antibiotic factor, preferably factor A, can be aanristered by the parenteral route, e.g., by i.m. injection, or i.v. infusion. For injection, the antibiotic or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is dissolved in a physiologically acceptable diluent at the desired concentration and administered.Suitable diluents include for example, Water for Innection, 0.9 saline, 58 dextrose, Ringer s solution, or other commonly employed diluent. For administration by i.v. infusion, the antibiotic or salt thereof can be made up in a physiological fluid or dilute nutrient at a suitable concentration for example, at a concentration between about 5 and about 10 , ad slowly infused with the fluid. Alternatively, the antibiotic may be administered by the piggy back method. The individual factors, combinations of the factors, or the whole complex of factors and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be made up in dosage unit formulations in hermetically sealed vials, sterile, rubber stoppered vials, or in piastic pouches. Such unit dosage forms can contain excipients such as antioxidants, solubilizing agents, dispersing agents, buffers, and the like. One such dosage unit formulation comprises 100 mg. of factor A, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in a rubber buty rubber stoppered vial. Another dosage unit torr.u n comprises 250 mg. of factor A, or a salt thereof, in a sterile, sealed vial.For i.v. infusion a dosage unit formulation of this invention may comprise 5 g. of factor A, or a phamaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in a plastic pouch. When used as an antibacterial agent, the A41030 complex or an A41030 factor may be administered either crally or parenterally. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the A41030 complex or factor is commonly administered together with a pharma ceutlcally acceptable carrier or diluent. The dosage of A41030 complex or factor will depend upon a variety of considerations, such as the nature and severity of the particular infection to be treated. Those skilledIn the art will recognize that appropriate dosage ranges and or dosage units for administration may be determined by considering the MIC and ED50 values and toxicity data herein provided, together with factors such as the patient or host and the infecting organism. The A41030 antibiotics are useful, inter alia, for suppressing the growth of Staphylococcus,Streptococcus and Propionibacterium acnes organisms, and the antibiotics could therefore be used, for example, in the treatment of acne. The A41030 individual factors, or mixtures thereof in the purified state, can be formulated in pharmaceutlcallv acceptable diluents such as isopropl alcohol for application to the skin. Such solutions can be made up with antibiotic concentrations of from about 1 to about 15 percent eight per volume. Alternatively, the antibiotics can be made up into creams or lotions for tion to the skin. The A41030 antibiotics are also useful for suppressing the growth of Clostridium difficile organisms, which cause Pseudomembranous colitis in the intestine. The A41030 individual factors or mixtures thereof could be used in the treatment ofPseudomembranous colitis by the oral administration of an effective dose of these antibiotics or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, prepared in a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form. For such use the antibiotic can be administered in gelatin capsules or in liquid suspension. The antibiotics of this invention also can be used in veterinary medicine in the treatment of infectious diseases in domestic and farm animals. They are useful also in animal husbandry, e.g., in enhancing the growth of beef cattle and other ruminants. An especially valuable use for the antibiotics of this invention resides in their ability to increase the production of milk in dairy cattle. These uses are further aspects of this invention which are described in more detail in the following paragraphs. The A41030 complex has shown activity against infectious canine hepatitis virus in vitro at 40 mcg. ml. The A41030 complex has also shown activity in vitro against pseudorabies at 20 mcg. ml and A41030 factor A has shown active in vitro against pseudorabies at 20 mcg. ml. Antibiotic A41030 complex has shown activity as a growth promoter in chickens, the test being carried out as follcws Test 1 Chicks, 8 day old Penobscot broilers, were utilized in this test. A total of 560 chicks were used, divided in groups of 7 birds each. There were 35 groups acting as controls, and 5 groups were treated with the antibiotic added to the standard chick ration at the rate of 20 g. of antibiotic A41030 complex per ton of feed. Feed and water were available to all groups ad libitum for 21 days. Two time replicates were run. The criteria for activity 3 increase in weight gain and or 2 improvement in feed efficiencv in one or both time replicates. The results are set forth in Table 23.

Accordingly, this invention provides a method of enhancing the growth of chickens which comprises administering to the chickens in their diet between about 20 and about 30 g. of an A41030 antibiotic factor or the A41030 antibiotic complex, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, per ton of feed. Alternatively, the antibiotic factors or the complex, in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable, non toxic salt can be administered in the drinking water of the chickens. Antibiotic A41030 also acts as a growth promoter when administered to weanling pigs. The antibiotic was tested in young pigs at several dosage levels, as later described.Test 2 The antibiotic A41030 complex was tested at levels of 5, 20, 50 and 100 ppm. in the diet of pigs initially weighing about 21 pounds 5 7 weeks of age .The experiment was conducted in an environmentally controlled nursery facility with wire mesh floors in the pens. There were five replicates per treatment and five pigs per replicate for the 27 day experiment. The results of this experiment appear in Table 24 Table 24 Level ADG ADF Treatment ppm lbs.

Test 3 The antibiotic A41030 complex further was tested in weanling pigs 17 pounds, 4 6 weeks of age at levels of 25, 50 and 100 gm. ton of feed for 35 days. There were four replicates of six pigs per treatment. Antibiotic A41030 complex when administered to these weanling pigs at the rates taught, increased the rate of gain by 5.6 percent, 8.5 percent, and 7.0 percent and improved the feed conversicn efficiency by 6.6 percent, 9.2 percent, and percent, when added to the diet at 25, 50 and 100 gm. ton, respectively.These results are recorded in Table 25.

The A41030 antibiotics are also useful for increasing the efficiency of feed utilization in ruminant animals. It is known that the efficiency of carbohydrate utilization in ruminants is increased by treatments which stimulate the animals rumen flora to produce propionate compounds rather than acetate or butyrate compounds for a more complete discussion, seeChurch et al. in Digestive Physiology and Nutrition ofRuminants, Vol. 2, 1971, pp. 622 and 625 . The effectiveness of antibiotic A41030 complex and A41030 factor A for modifying the ratio of volatile fatty acids produced in the rumen is shown by means of in vitro tests according to the procedure set forth below. Test 4 Rumen fluid was obtained from a steer which has a surgically installed fistula opening into the rumen. The steer was maintained on a high grain ration, the composition of which follows 69.95 coarse ground corn 10 ground corncobs 8 soybean meal 508 protein 5 alfalfa meal 5 molasses 0.6 z urea 0.5 dicalcium phosphate 0.5 calcium carbonate 0.3 salt 0.07 Vitamin A and D2 premix 0.05 Vitamin E premix 0.03 trace mineral premix A sample of rumen fluid was strained through 4 layers of cheesecloth and the filtrate was collected in a vacuum bottle.The particulate matter retained by the cheesecloth was resuspended in enough physiological buffer to return it to the original volume of the rumen fluid, and the suspension was again strained through cheesecloth.

The clear layer was then separated and diluted 1 1 with the same buffer, and adjusted to pH 7.0. Ten ml. of the diluted rumen fluid thus prepared were placed in a 25 ml. flask with 90 mg. of finely powdered high grain ration, the composition of which is described above. The compound to be tested was weighed out and dissolved in the appropriate solvent, supra. The solution was placed on the finelypowdered ration in each test flask and dried. Two sets of four untreated control flasks each were prepared also. One set of four untreated control flasks was incubated for 16 hours at 380C. with the test flasks. The other set of four untreated control flasks were zero time controls, the fermentation in which was stopped as soon as the flasks were prepared by addition of 2 ml. of 25 percent metaphosphoric acid to each flask. Fermentation in the Incubated test and control flasks was stopped at the end of 16 hours by addition of 2 ml. of 25 percent metaphosphoric acid to each flask. All of the samples were allowed to settle, and the supernatant was analyzed by gas chromatographic methods for acetate, propionate, and butyrate. The analysis for each volatile fatty acid found in the zero time controls was substracted from the analyses of the untreated controls and of the test flasks. The resulting values reflect the amount of each VFA produced during the 16 hour fermentation period. The data in Table 26 are reported as the ratio of VFA s produced in treated flasks to VFA s produced in untreated control flasks. This method of reporting the data shows most clearly the results of the changes in the chemistry of the rumen brought about by the present novel method of feed utilization improvement.

Administration of the antibiotic compounds useful In this method prevents and treats ketosis as well as improves feed utilization. The causative mechanism of ketosis is a deficient production of propionate compounds. A presently recommended treat et is administration of propionic acid or feeds which preferentially produce propionates. Obviously the method disclosed in this application, encourages propionate production from ordinary feeds, reducing the ncidence of ketosis. It has been found that the antibiotic com pounds disclosed herein increase the efficiency of feed utIlIzation in ruminant animals when administered in a propionate increasing dose. The antibiotics, .dIvidually or as the whole complex, or as an economical, iess purified whole complex, are administered suitably by incorporation in the animal s feed. The antibiotic compounds, however, can be usefullv administered in other ways. For example, they can be incorporated into tablets, drenches, boluses, or capsules, and dosed to the animals. Formulation of the antibiotic compounds in such dosage forms can be accomplished bv means of methods well known in the veterinary pharmaceutical art. Each individual dosage unit should contain a quantity of the feed efficiency improving compound which has a direct relation to the proper daily dose for the animal to be treated. Capsules are readily produced by filling gelatin capsules with any desired form of the desired antibiotic. If desired, the antibiotic can be diluted with an inert powdered diluent, such as a sugar, starch, or purified crystalline cellulose in order to increase its volume for convenience in filling capsules. Tablets of the antibiotics are made by conventional pharmaceutical processes. Manufacture of tablets is a well known and hihly advancd art. In addition to the active ingredient, a tablet usually contains a base, a disintegrator, an absorbent, a binder, and a lubricant. Typical bases include lactose, fine icing sugar, sodium chloride, starch and mannitol. Starch is also a good disintegrator, as is alginic acid. Surface active agents such as sodium lauryl sulfate and dioctyl sodium sulphosuccinate may be used also. Commonly used absorbents again include starch and lactose, while magnesium carbonate is also useful for oily substances. Frequently used binders are gelatin, gums, starch, dextrin and various cellulose derivatives.Among the commonly used lubricants are magnesium stearate, talc, paraffin wax, various metallic soaps, and polyethylene glycol. The antibiotic compound can be administered also as a slow payout bolus. Such boluses are made as tablets are made, except that a means to delay the dissolution of the antibiotic is provided. Boluses are made to release for lengthy periods. The slow dissolution is assisted by choosing a highly waterinsoluble form of the antibiotic. A substance such as iron filings is added to raise the density of the bolus and keep it static on the bottom of the rumen. Dissolution of the antibiotic is delayed by use of a matrix of insoluble materials in which the drug is embedded. For example, substances such as vegetable waxes, purified mineral waxes, and waterinsoluble polymeric materials are useful. Drenches of the antibiotics are prepared most easily by choosing a water soluble form of the antibiotic. If an insoluble form is desired for some reason, a suspension may be made. Alternatively, a drench may be formulated as a solution in a physio logically acceptable solvent such as a polyethylene glycol. Suspensions of insoluble forms of the antibiotics can be prepared in nonsolvents such as vegetable oils such as peanut, corn, or sesame oil in a glycol such as propylene glycol or a polyethylene glycol or In water, depending on the form of the antibiotic chosen. Suitable physiologically acceptable adjuvants are necessary in order to keep the antibiotic suspended. The adjuvants can be chosen from among the thickeners, such as carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, and the alginates. Many classes of surfactants also serve to suspend antibiotics. For example, lecithin, alkylphenol polyethylene oxide adducts, naphthalenesulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, and the polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters are useful for making suspensions in liquid nonsolvents. In addition, many substances which affect the hydrophilicity, density, and surface tension of the liquid can assist in making suspensions in individual cases. For example, silicone antifoams, glycols, sorbitol, and sugars can be useful suspending agents. The suspendable antibiotic may be offered to the animal grower as a suspension, or as a dry mixture of the antibiotic and adjuvants to be diluted before use. The antibiotics may also be administered in the drinking water of the ruminants. Incorporation into drinking water is performed by adding a watersoluble or water suspendable form of the desired antibiotic to the water in the proper amount. Formulation of the antibiotic for addition to drinking water follows the same principles as formulation of drenches. The most practical way to treat animals with these antibiotic compounds is by the formulation of the compounds into the feed supply. Any type of feed may be medicated with the antibiotic compounds, including common dry feeds, liquid feeds, and pelleted feeds. The methods of formulating drugs into animal feds are well known. It is usual to make a concentrated drug premix as a raw material for medicated feeds. For example, typical drug premises may contain from about one to about 400 grams of drug per pound of premix. The wide range results from the wide range of concentration of drug which may be desired in the final feed. Premises may be either liquid or solid. The formulation of animal feeds containing the proper amounts of the antibiotic compounds for useful treatment is mainly a matter of arithmetic. It is necessary only to calculate the amount of compound which it is desired to administer to each animal, to take into account the amount of feed per day which the animal eats, and the concentration of antibiotic compound in the premix to be used, and calculate the proper concentration of antibiotic compound in the feed. Ail of the methods of formulating, mixing, and pelleting feeds which are normally used in the ruminant or nonruminant feed art are entirely appropriate for manufacturing feeds containing the antibiotic compounds usable in this method. It has been found also that antibiotic A41030 complex not only increases the efficiency of feed utilization in ruminants utilized for meat production as described hereinbefore , but also causes a surprising Improvement in milk production without an adverse effect on milk quality when administered to lactating animals having a developed rumen process. The requirements and objectives of feed utilization of lactating ruminants such as dairy cows differ considerably from those of ruminants raised for meat production. Ruminal volatile fatty acid VFA production is of course of primary importance, because it relates directly to the normal maintenance of the animal, as well as to the quality and quantity of the milk produced by the animal. In the lactating ruminant, however, energy for lactation is the most limiting factor in milk production. Acetate is required for milk fat synthesis, while propionate is utilized to produce glucose, which in turn is required for lactose synthesis, and also has a minor role In milk fat production.Butyrate is more glycogenic than lipogenic, the lipogenic aspect being indirect since butyrate must first be degraded to acetate units before it can be utilized for long chain fatty acid synthesis, i.e., milk fat. Accordingly, in order to increase milk production in lactating ruminants, it is necessary to increase propionate production, but not at a large expense of acetate and butyrate production. Significantly reduced acetate and butyrate levels result in drastically reduced milk fat content, thereby rendering milk production less efficient with respect to both quality and economically bulk milk prices are determined in part by milk fat content . The present improvement in milk production is manifested in Increased protein content of the milk, without appreciable change of fat content. The method cf accomplishing the improvement comprises orally administering to a lactating ruminant a propiorate increasing amount of antibiotic A41030 complex. The antibiotic A41030 complex can be formulated for convenient oral administration to a ruminant, the formulation being as a feed pre mix, a feed additive, a lick, a water additive, or if desired, the antibiotic A41030 complex can be formulated for slow release over a prolonged period of time following a single administration. That administering a propionate increasing amount of antibiotic A41030 complex to a lactating ruminant having a developed rumen function improves the milk production without adversely affecting the milk composition has been demonstrated by in vivo studies. Test 5 Two trials were conducted using Holstein cows which had just calved. In the first trial, twelve cows were employed, divided into two groups of six cows. Two weeks after calving, the test animals began a one week preliminary period during which all the animals received a daily ration of feed and water, with no antibiotic being administered. All the cows received a standard feed ration containing 50 corn silage, 20 alfalfa hay, and 30 concentrate, the concentrate having the following composition Concentrate Ingredient Percent Lbs TonGround Corn, Yellow 23.50 470.0Dicalcium Phosphate 1.50 30.0Limestone 1.25 25.0Molasses Dehy 2.15 43.0Mon Na Phosphate 0.10 2.0Soybean Oil Meal 47.00 940.0Vitamin A D3 Premix Ca Ol 1 0.35 7.0Vitamin E Premix 2 0.10 2.0Selenium Premix 3 0.05 1.0Salt 1.00 20.0Sodium Bicarbonate 1.00 20.0Distillers Dried Solubles Corn 22.00 440.0 100.00 2000.0 1 Each pound of Vitamin A and D3 premix contains 2,000,000 USP units Vitamin A and 225,750 USP units Vitamin D3 2 Each pound of Vitamin E premix contains 20,000 IU Vitamin E 3 Each kg of selenium premix contains 200 mg. of selenium as sodium selenite. The calculated analysis for selenium is from the premix only. All the cows were fed the standard ration at the rate of 2.95 percent of body weight the body weight having been determined at the start of the one week preliminsry period plus two pounds of a formulation called a topdress, having the following composition Tot, dress Inaredient Percent Lbs TonGround Corn, Yellow 20.00 400.0Grit O Cobs 38.00 760.0Cane Molasses 2.50 50.0Oats 11.00 220.0Soybean Oil Meal 25.00 500.0Vitamin A D3 Premix CA O1 1 1.10 22.0Salt 0.40 8.0Animal Fat 2.00 40.0 100.00 2000.0 1 Each pound of Vitamin A and D3 premix contains 2,000,000 USP units Vitamin A and 225,750 USP units Vitamin D3. During the one week preliminary period, all cows received control topdress. Beginning with the treatment period, test animals received their respective treatments for eight weeks with antibiotic 1030 complex the test compound mixed iXto the topdress. Control cows continued receiving the unmedicated topdress, identical to the topdress fed in the preliminary period. Control topdress and the topdress containing the antibiotic A41030 complex were fed to the experimental cows at the rate of two pounds daily within one hour of the morning feeding of the standard feed ration described above. The treated group received 600 mg. head day of the antibiotic. This trial was repeated, following the general procedure described above, and labeled Trial 2. The average daily milk production, milk composition, and persistency of milk production of both trials were analyzed and the data are reported in Table 27.The perslstency values were calculated by dividing the average milk production during the eight week treatment period by average production during the preliminary nontreatment period. Persistency values express how well the treatment groups performed after initiation of treatment ccmpared to performance before treatment initiation. Normal persistency for the trial was expected to be about 94 to about 96 percent. In each experiment, cows fed A41030 complex had higher persistencies. This shows an observable response to treatment i.e., maintenance of the preliminary period milk production at a higher level than control cows . The analysis of milk composition reported inTable 27 demonstrates that milk fat is not different between the treated cows and the non treated control cows, whereas protein content is enhanced. Increasing milk protein is an especially desirable response since even a small increase would significantly increase the amount of cheese that could be made from the milk.

The antibiotic A41030 complex and factors A, B,C, D, E, F, and G can be isolated for use in animal feeds by the methods disclosed in the Examples set forth earlierIt is also possible, if desired, after the production ofA41030 antibiotic activity, to simply dry the whole fermentation broth and mix the dried medium directly into the feed or feed premix. Further, it is possible that the hereindisclosedA41030 antibiotic complex and factors can be combined with a synthetic tanning agent which is a sulfited phenol formaldehyde contain, such as is sold by A.J. O.J. PilarInc. of Newark, N.J., under the tradename TruTan RTRegular. The combination of the antibiotic and the synthetic tanning agent, the antibiotic syntan complex, cai be used without separation of the constituents, in the animal feed supplement compositions described above. It is usual to treat economic animals, including ruminants, with a variety of growth promoters, disease preventives, and disease treatments throughout their lives. Such drugs are often used in combination.The instant method may be practiced in combination with other treatments. As has been shown, antibiotic A41030 complex andA41030 factor A beneficially alter the production of propionates relative to the production of acetates in the rumen. The same treatment also benefits monogastric animals which ferment fibrous vegetable matter in the cecum. The monogastric animals here referred to are those which consume fibrous vegetable food and digest at least part of it by microbiological fermentation in the cecum. The cecal fermentation follows a chemical pathway similar to rumen fermentation. Horses, swine, and rabbits are exemplary animals which digest a part of their food by cecal fermentation.The overall feed utilization of such animals is improved by the oral administration of these antibiotics which cause a beneficial change in the propionate acetate ratio. Horses and rabbits are exemplary of animals in which cecal fermentation is a major part of the total digestive process, and in which these antibiotics are accordingly particularly beneficial.
