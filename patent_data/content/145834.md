## Description
This invention relates to compositions which are useful as ion selective membranes. The ion selective compositions are useful as ion selective membranes which are capable of selectively transporting a first ion in preference to a second ion. These membranes are useful in ion selective electrodes of various types. In the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases as well as in preventative health checkups, it is becoming increasingly important to monitor the concentrations of certain ions in a patient s body. Ions which have merited considerable attention in the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease, manic depressive psychosis, diabetes, hypertension and kidney disease are the alkali metal cations, e.g. lithium, sodium and potassium. A great variety of electrodes and devices for the measurement of such cations in solutions are known. Usually, they include a reference electrode and a separate ion selective electrode. When these two electrodes are simultaneously immersed in the same sample of a solution containing such ions, a potential develops across a membrane between the electrodes, which potential is proportional to the concentration of the ion to which the ion selective electrode is sensitive. Frequently, it is desirable to measure the concentration of one ion in preference to other ions which may be in a solution. In that case, the ion selective composition of the ion selective electrode must be capable of selectively transporting the first ion across the membrane in preference to all other ions. An electrode having this capability is often referred to in the art as an ion selective electrode. One type of ion selective electrode has an electrode body usually a glass container containing a reference solution in contact with a half cell of known potential a reference electrode and an ion selective glass membrane located in an aperture in the electrode body. The ion selective membrane is mounted in such a fashion that, when the electrode is immersed in the unknown solution, the membrane contacts both the reference and unknown solutions. A metal probe coated with a layer of insoluble salt of the metal in the reference solution and immersed therein serves as one of the contacts for measuring the potential between the electrodes and provides a reference potential for the electrode. The sensitivity of the electrode to an ion in solution is determined by the composition of the glass membrane. This type of electrode is referred to in the art as a barrel electrode. In addition to glass membranes, polymeric ion selective membranes are also known. These membranes generally comprise a polymeric binder or support as a supporting matrix which is impregnated with a solution of an ion selective carrier in a carrier solvent. The ion selective carrier is a compound which is capable of sequentially complexing the desired ion, transporting the ion through the composition and releasing the ion. This compound is also referred to in the art as an ionophore or ion carrier . Depending upon the ionophore, solvent and binder, membranes of this type can be used to detect a particular ion preferentially to other ions which may be in the solution. A significant advance in the ion selective electrode art is the dry operative electrode described in U.S. Patent 4,214,968. Prior to the discovery of such dry operative ion selective electrodes, electrodes had to be either stored in an aqueous solution or treated with an aqueous solution Just prior to use in an ion activity determining operation. The term dry operative refers to an ion selective electrode which provides reproducible potentiometric determination of ion activity which is related to the ion concentration of an aqueous test solution with no requirement for wet storage or preconditioning prior to use. One of the specific ion selective electrodes disclosed in the examples of U.S. Patent 4,214,968 is a sodium ion selective electrode using methyl monensin as the sodium selective ionophore. While methyl monensin is a useful ionophore for some ion selective membranes and electrodes, still further improvements, particularly in the selectivity of the electrode for one cation over another, are desired. For example, methyl monensin is useful in the determination of sodium in blood serum because blood serum usually contains a relatively high level of sodium compared to the competing ion potassium. However, a higher degree of selectivity of sodium over potassium is needed for the determination of sodium in urine and some other biological fluids e.g. intracellular fluids containing red blood cells because urine and those fluids either have widely fluctuating concentrations of potassium and sodium ions, or have more potassium ions than sodium ions. In other instances, it is desirable to selectively determine the potassium ion concentration in biological fluids which may contain a variety of other cations, including sodium. Where the concentrations of those other cations e.g. sodium are high in comparison to potassium ion concentration, or where the potassium ion concentration widely fluctuates, a high degree of selectivity of potassium over sodium is desired. Crown ethers are well known ion complexing compounds. They complex, for example, with alkali and alkaline earth metal ions, ammonium ions and others. Many crown ethers, however, are not adequately selective to particular ions. Further, an ionophore must be capable, not only of selectively complexing an ion from the solution, but also of transporting the ion across the membrane and then decomplexing the ion into the solution on the other side of the membrane. Because of these factors, crown ethers which have been tested in ion selective compositions have not been entirely satisfactory. For example, Example 51 of U.S. Patent 4,214,968 mentioned above describes the use of two crown ethers, 1,5,9,13 tetramethyl 1,5,9,13 tetranonyl tetrafuro 16 crown 4 ether and dicyclohexyl 12 crown 4 ether, as ionophores in dry operative ion selective electrodes. Either unacceptable electrode drift or poor ion selectivity, particularly to lithium ions, was exhibited by those crown ethers. Hence, crown ethers are not necessarily the preferred ionophores for use in ion selective electrodes where severe accuracy, precision, ion selectivity and reproducibility requirements exist. The preparation and testing as ion complexing compounds of several azo containing crown ether dyes are described in Shiga et al The problem to be solved is to provide crown ether ion selective compositions which are selective for certain cations e.g. Na or K and produce membranes having acceptable electrode drift. The membranes can assay selectively for those cations in solutions containing a variety of such ions in fluctuating or disproportionate concentrations. This problem is solved by providing an ion selective composition for use as an ion selective membrane comprising wherein This composition is useful as an ion selective membrane. In preferred embodiments, the solvating compound is a hydrophobic carrier solvent. Crown ethers is a term generally ascribed to cyclic polyethers, the first of which were reported by C. J.

Crown ethers useful in the practice of this invention include wherein R₂, R₃ and R₄ are defined as follows wherein wherein wherein wherein wherein wherein wherein and wherein The crown ethers useful in the practice of this invention can be prepared by two general procedures. One procedure consists of condensing the appropriate diphenol with the ditosylate of the appropriate glycol. For example, azo crown ethers I, II, III, IV, XXX and XXXI are prepared according to the following general equation The second general procedure consists of cyclizing the appropriate phenol to the azo crown ether as in the preparation of crown ethers XVI XXIX and XXXIV XXXVI. This procedure can be illustrated by the following general equation The details of the preparation of several crown ethers useful in this invention are given below prior to the Examples. In addition to the crown ethers described above, the compositions of the present invention include a compound which is capable of solvating the crown ether. Solvation is necessary so that the complexed ion can be transported through the membrane by the solvated crown ether. In some embodiments, one or more polymeric binders which are capable of solvating the crown ether are used. If a polymer is capable of dissolving, at least partially, the crown ether, it is useful in this embodiment. Exemplary polymers which are so useful are described in U.S. Patent 3,419,634. The preparation of ion selective membranes using these solvating polymers is described in U.S. Patent 3,743,588. In these embodiments, the polymer functions as both the compound which is capable of solvating the crown ether and the supporting matrix for the composition. In other and preferred embodiments, the crown ether is solvated by one or more separate organic solvents and the supporting matrix is a separate component. Such a matrix must allow for the transport of the ion which is bound to the crown ether in the organic solvent. For example, a porous glass support is useful as the supporting matrix. In these embodiments, the crown ether is dissolved in the organic solvent and the resulting solution is imbibed into the porous glass support to provide an ion selective membrane. In other and preferred embodiments, the solution of the crown ether is dispersed in a hydrophobic binder, e.g. a hydrophobic polymer binder. By hydrophobic is meant substantially water insoluble. The binder dispersion is coated and dried to produce an ion selective membrane. Where a separate solvent is used to solvate the crown ether, the solvent can be any of a wide variety of solvents, provided that it is capable of at least partially dissolving the crown ether. The solvent often referred to in the art as a carrier solvent provides ion mobility in the membrane. If a hydrophobic binder is used as the supporting matrix, the solvent must be compatible with the binder. Useful carrier solvents are hydrophobic organic solvents including phthalates, sebacates, aromatic and aliphatic ethers, phosphates, mixed aromatic aliphatic phosphates, adipates, nitrated ethers or esters and mixtures of these solvents. Particularly useful solvents include dibutyl sebacate, bromophenyl phenyl ether, triisodecyl trimellitate, bis 2 ethyl hexyl sebacate, If the crown ether is included in a carrier solvent as described above, a membrane is formed using a dispersion of the solvent crown ether in one or more binders as the supporting matrix. Useful binders include hydrophobic natural or synthetic polymers capable of forming thin films of sufficient permeability to produce, in combination with the crown ether and carrier solvent, ionic mobility across the membrane. Useful polymers include poly vinyl chloride poly vinylidene chloride poly acrylonitrile polyurethanes, particularly aromatic polyurethanes copolymers of vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride poly vinyl butyral poly vinyl formal poly vinyl acetate copolymers of vinyl acetate and vinyl alcohol silicone elastomers and copolymers of vinyl alcohol, cellulose esters and polycarbonates. Other useful polymers include carboxylated polymers of poly vinyl chloride and mixtures and copolymers of such materials. Membranes including these binders, the crown ethers and the carrier solvents described hereinabove are prepared using conventional film coating or casting techniques. The membranes can contain the described components over a wide range of concentrations or coverages. The coverage of crown ether depends upon the particular crown ether used and the compound used to solvate it, as well as other factors. The preferred membranes comprise a hydrophobic binder having the solvent and crown ether dispersed therein. In these membranes, crown ether coverages of between about 0.1 g m² and 2.0 g m² are useful and coverages between 0.2 g m² and 0.8 g m² are preferred. The carrier solvent is present in an amount sufficient to solvate the crown ether. The amount therefore depends on the particular solvent and crown ether chosen. Generally, more solvent is used than is necessary to solvate the crown ether so that it remains solvated under a variety of storage conditions. A 100 to 500 percent excess on a weight basis is useful. Usually, the coverage of carrier solvent will be within the range of about 2 g m² to about 24 g m². The amount of hydrophobic binder which is present is determined by the desired thickness of the membrane and by the necessity for providing support for the crown ether solvent dispersion. The membranes generally have a thickness in the range of from about 2 µm to about 20 µm. The binder coverage is usually between about 2 g m² and 24 g m², and preferably from about 3 to about 12 g m². In addition to the binder, crown ether and solvent, the compositions of the present invention optionally contain other components such as surfactants and plasticizers in amounts known to those skilled in the art. Surfactants are useful components of the described membranes. The surfactants serve a variety of functions including improving the coatability of the membrane composition and improving the solvation of the crown ether by the binder or solvent. Useful surfactants include nonionic surfactants such as the alkylaryl polyether alcohols Tritons available from Rohm and Haas Co As noted, the membranes using the compositions of the present invention are useful in a variety of electrode structures. For example, the membranes are useful in place of, or in addition to, the glass ion selective membrane of a conventional barrel type electrode. Useful electrodes of this type are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patents 3,598,713, 3,502,560, 3,562,129, 3,691,047, 3,753,887, 3,833,495, 3,671,414 and 3,743,588. The membranes are also useful in the ion selective electrodes described in Japanese Patent Publications 17851 1982 and 17852 1982, and particularly in the dry ion selective electrodes described therein. In particularly preferred embodiments, the compositions of the present invention are useful in dry operative ion selective electrodes as described in U.S. Patent 4,214,968. The membranes and electrodes can be used to selectively determine the concentration of a cation, such as an alkali metal ion e.g. lithium, sodium, potassium, etc. , in specimen samples, e.g. in an aqueous solution, e.g. biological fluids such as blood sera and urine or suspension of tissue. Generally, a portion of such a sample is brought into physical contact with the electrode e.g. a dry ion selective electrode described above which is capable of making potentiometric measurements related to the alkali metal ion concentration. Subsequently, the difference in potential between the portion of specimen sample and the reference electrode is measured. Preferably, a drop of the specimen sample is spotted onto the ion selective membrane of such electrode by hand or machine or other suitable dispensing means, but other ways of contacting the electrode with the sample are acceptable. Some of the crown ethers described herein were prepared using the procedures described below. All solvents used in the following preparations were reagent grade unless otherwise specified. Dimethylformamide was dried over 4A molecular sieves before use. Potassium Crown ethers II and IV were prepared in the following manner. About 200 ml of tetrahydrofuran dried over 5A molecular sieves and 6.4 g 57 mmol of potassium Crown ether I was prepared in a manner similar to that used to prepare crown ether II using 6 g 28 mmol of 2,2 azodiphenol and 12.8 g 28 mmol of triethyleneglycol ditosylate. Crown ether I was obtained as a dark red oil which hardened to a solid 3.3 g, 36 yield, m.p. 58 60 C . This hardened material consisted of both Crown ether III was similarly prepared from 6 g 28 mmol of 2,2 azodiphenol and 14 g 28 mmol of tetraethyleneglycol ditosylate, yielding 3.7 g 35.5 yield, m.p. 97 102 C . The product was isolated after filtration and solvent removal by trituration in boiling hexane a dozen times. Crown ether XIX was prepared in the following manner. Crown ethers XVI XVIII and XX XXV were similarly prepared. A solution of resorcinol monomethyl ether 50 g, 0.4 mol in glacial acetic acid 50 ml was cooled to 10 C and added dropwise over 3.5 hours to a cooled 15 C , stirred solution of fuming nitric acid 33 ml, 0.76 mol in 150 ml of glacial acetic acid. The temperature was maintained between 10 and 15 C by controlling the rate of addition. The resulting thick, red black slush was then mixed with 400 ml of crushed ice and stirred for one hour. The mixture was then extracted with ether 2 x 400 ml , concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was steam distilled to give 32.1 g 47 yield of a yellow solid. Recrystallization from methanol gave product having a m.p. of 92 93 C. A stirred solution of tosyl chloride 38 g, 0.2 mol in 100 ml of pyridine in a 250 ml flask provided with a drying tube was cooled to 10 C in an ice methanol bath. A solution of 2 2 chloro ethoxy ethanol 25 g, 0.2 mol in 30 ml of pyridine was added to the tosyl chloride solution. After 20 minutes, the reaction flask was refrigerated overnight. The resulting product was isolated by pouring the cold mixture onto 700 g of ice, stirring for one hour, and extracting the resulting oil into ether, yielding 45.1 g 81 yield of a light yellow liquid. The sodium salt of 5 methoxy 2 nitrophenol 19.1 g, 0.1 mol and the above chlorotosylate 27.8 g, 0.1 mol were dissolved in 800 ml of dimethylformamide and heated on a steam bath with stirring for 16 hours. The resulting mixture was poured onto 800 ml of ice and the product obtained was extracted into ether. Purification by flash chromatography 45 x 60 mm, CH₂Cl₂ afforded 17 g 66 yield of light yellow oil. 5 Methoxy 2 nitro 2 2 chloroethoxy ethoxy benzene 6.62 g, .024 mol was dissolved in methanol 100 ml in a Parr flask, and 200 mg of 10 Pd C were added together with concentrated HCl 2.1 ml, 0.024 mol . The resulting mixture was hydrogenated at room temperature for 3 hours. After filtration through a Celite pad, the methanol was removed under reduced pressure. The crude product thus obtained was dissolved in a minimum amount of methanol and treated with 1 l of anhydrous ether with cooling to give the amine hydrochloride 5.6 g, 83 yield . A solution of the amine hydrochloride 2.26 g, 8 mmol in 8 ml of water and 0.8 ml 9.28 mmol of concentrated HCl were cooled in an ice bath. A cold solution of 8 mmol of sodium nitrite in 6 ml water was added portionwise over 5 minutes and the cold diazonium solution was used immediately in the next step. The cold diazonium solution of the preceeding step was added dropwise to a stirring solution of p cresol 0.84 g, 7.8 mmol in 6.4 ml of 10 NaOH and 6 ml of water at 0 C. A reddish brown oil separated as the reaction proceeded and after 15 minutes, the mixture was acidified to pH 4 5 with dilute HCl and extracted with CH₂Cl₂. Chromatography on 200 g of silica gel, eluting with CH₂Cl₂ gave 1.46 g 51 yield of product m.p. 83 85 C . A mixture of 2.4 mmol of the azo compound prepared in the preceeding step, one equivalent of potassium Crown ether XXVII was prepared using the following procedure. Crown ethers XXVI and XXVIII were prepared similarly using the appropriate reactants. This compound was prepared in a manner analogous to the preparation of 5 methoxy 2 nitro 2 2 chloroethoxy ethoxy benzene for crown ether XIX, except that the sodium salt of The above nitro intermediate was reduced using the method as described in the preparation of crown ether XIX. Diazotization was accomplished as in the preparation of crown ether XIX. The cold diazonium solution 8 mmol prepared in the preceeding step was used immediately by adding it dropwise to a stirring solution of 4 methoxy 1 naphthol 1.39 g, 8 mmol in 6.8 ml of 10 NaOH and 6 ml of water at 0 C. The resulting azo product crystallized out as the reaction proceeded. The mixture was acidified to pH 4 5 with acetic acid and the solid obtained was recrystallized from an acetic acid water mixture to give 2.68 g 84 yield, m.p. 108 109 C . To 1.2 g 3 mmol of the above azo compound in 1 l of dimethylformamide was added 336 mg 3 mmol of potassium Crown ethers V and XXXIII were prepared in the following manner. A solution of 1,3 dichloropropane 11.3 g, 0.1 mol and the sodium salt of o nitrophenol 32.2 g, 0.05 mol in 250 ml of dimethylformamide in a 500 ml flask was stirred at 130 C for about 16 hours. After cooling the solution, it was poured into 1 l of ice and water with rapid stirring. After 2 hours at 0 C, the resulting mustard colored solid was filtered and recrystallized from methanol 1 1 to give 22.2 g 70 yield of colorless needles of 1,3 bis o nitrophenoxy propane. A sample of this product 3.12 g, 9.8 mmol was mixed with sodium hydroxide 1.5 g , lithium hydroxide 1.5 g , methanol 40 ml , tetrahydrofuran 100 ml and water 100 ml in a 500 ml flask. This solution was brought to reflux with vigorous stirring, and zinc dust 6 g, 0.09 mol was added in portions over 2 hours. After further refluxing for about 10 hours, the solution was cooled, filtered to remove the zinc and the tetrahydrofuran and methanol were removed under reduced pressure. The residual aqueous suspension of red orange oil was extracted with ether CH₂Cl₂ providing a red syrup 2.6 g which was purified by gravity chromatography eluting with CH₂Cl₂. Thin layer chromatography indicated the presence of both crown ethers V and XXXIII. Further chromatography on silica gel with 20 ethyl acetate in hexane gave pure products V as a yellow solid, 950 mg 36 , m.p. 76 77 C, and XXXIII as a red orange oil, 380 mg 15 yield . Crown ethers VI VIII were prepared in the following manner. 2,2 Dihydroxybenzylether was prepared according to the procedure described by Sprung and Gladstone in Crown ether XXXIII was prepared in the following manner. Salicylaldehyde was condensed with Crown ether XL was prepared in the following manner. The starting material, 4 ,4 dimethoxy Two equivalents of the amine hydrochloride noted hereinabove which was used to prepare crown ether XXVII was diazotized and slowly added to one equivalent of the above described xylylene bis phenol in dilute sodium hydroxide. The crude, solid xylylene bis azophenol thereby formed was purified by chromatography on silica gel to provide pure material as a viscous red oil that slowly solidified 62 yield, m.p. 80 82 C . This bis azophenol was cyclized to the bis azo crown ether in the same manner as used for the preparation of XXVII noted hereinabove . The crude azo crown mixed salt complex that resulted was partitioned between CH₃Cl₂ and water, and the evaporated organic layer was extracted with ether and hexane to give crown ether XL as a red foam 40 yield . In the following Examples, ion selective electrodes were prepared using a variety of the crown ethers described above. The electrodes were of the format and were prepared by the methods described in U.S. Patent 4,214,968. The electrode comprised a polyester support having thereon, in sequence a silver silver chloride reference electrode an electrolyte layer comprising gelatin 3 6 g m² , NaCl 1.5 3.5 g m² , glycerol 0.25 0.4 g m² and Olin Surfactant 10G 0.3 0.9 g m² and a membrane layer. This membrane layer contained a binder comprising 1.8 carboxylated poly vinyl chloride 3 6 g m² , a carrier solvent as indicated 4 8 g m² , the crown ether as indicated 0.1 0.3 g m² , and the surfactant DC 510 0.03 0.09 g m² . A Corning digital readout potentiometer was used to determine potentials. The electromotive force values were taken 3 minutes after contact with the test solutions. Activity coefficients were calculated as described by Bates and Altease in Ion Selective Electrodes R. Durst, Ed. , Nat. Bur. of Stand. Spec., Publ. 314, Washington, D.C., 1969. The following examples are provided to illustrate the practice of this invention. An ion selective electrode was prepared containing crown ether I as ionophore and tested for ion selectivity using various carrier solvents. In the Shiga et al reference noted above, it was reported that crown ether I has an aqueous solution to benzene extraction coefficient of 4.18 for sodium ion and 2.77 for potassium ion. This example indicates, however, that crown ether I is highly selective for K over Na in an ion selective composition of the invention. Crown ether I and a carrier solvent were incorporated into a membrane layer of the ion selective electrode described above. The electrode was tested by spotting 10µl aliquots of solutions containing 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 or 0.3 M sodium chloride and 0.1 M KCl onto samples of the electrode. Potentials were measured against a silver silver chloride electrode. The potential developed for each aliquot was plotted against the concentration of sodium in the aliquot. The result was a Nernstian slope in the range of 10 ⁴ to 10 ¹ M sodium for each experiment. The selectivity coefficient k for K was calculated sodium being defined as one using the potential data from the KCl aliquot. The results are shown in Table I below. Valinomycin was used as the ionophore in a control electrode. These results indicate that, contrary to the teaching of Shiga et al, crown ether I is more selective to K over Na when used in the described electrode. Ion selective electrodes were prepared using crown ether II as the ionophore in a manner like that described hereinabove. The ion selectivity of samples of these electrodes were evaluated by spotting 10 ml aliquots of solutions containing 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 or 0.3 M sodium chloride and 0.1 M potassium chloride, lithium chloride, ammonium chloride, calcium chloride or magnesium chloride onto the samples. The results are summarized in Table II below. A control electrode was also prepared using methyl monesin as the ionophore. In the Aoki et al reference noted above, crown ether II is described as having only a slight preference for Na over tetramethylammonium ion, Li and K in an ion exchange column. The data of this Example, however, indicates an unexpected and significant selectivity of this crown ether for Na over K and other cations when used in an ion selective electrode. Ion selective electrodes were prepared in a manner as described above, using crown ether IV as the ionophore. The ion selectivity of samples of these electrodes were also evaluated according to the procedure described in Example 2. The results are summarized in Table III below. Ion selective electrodes were prepared in a manner as described hereinabove using various crown ethers as ionophores and various carrier solvents. The ion selectivities of samples of these electrodes were also evaluated according to the procedure described in the previous Examples. The results are summarized in Tables IV and V below.
