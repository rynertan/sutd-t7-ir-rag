# Cloning vectors.

## Abstract
There is described a functionally independent recom binant DNA cloning vector comprising a a functional replicon containing restriction fragment of plasmid pEL7 and b one or more DNA segments that confer resistance to at least one antibiotic when transformed into a sensitive host cell, and c if desired, a replicon that is functional in E. coli and a DNA segment that confers antibiotic resistance in a sensitive E. coli host cell, said host cells being susceptible to transformation, cell division, and culture.
