The main unit 2 is provided on its top surface with data and command entry means consisting of a keyboard 6 comprising a numeric pad 4 and various function keys 5, and at a position above the keyboard with a display 7 such as a liquid crystal display, for example. The main unit 2 is provided with a power switch 8 on one side and an open close button 9 on each side.The main unit 2 is further provided at an upper portion with a support member 10 for holding a thermal label roll R which consists of a thermal label strip T wound into a roll, the arrangement being such that after labels L are printed and detached the labels L are discharged from a front portion of the unit.At the rear end of the main unit 2 are provided a socket 12 for connecting a pen scanner 11 and a socket 13 for connecting a battery 27 to a battery charger which will be described later. The numeral 14 denotes the discharge outlet for the backing sheet S. Iri the Figure 1A embodiment, the pen scanner 11 is used for reading a bar code B printed on a shelf tag F and representing a merchandise code or the like and the data thus read is input to the thermal label printer 1. In. the Figure 1B embodiment, the pen scanner 11 can be used to read a despatch slip or the slip number bar code on a label F already affixed to a parcel.With reference to Figure 2, the thermal label strip T passes from the thermal label roll R on the support member 10 into a label strip passage 18 via a position sensor 15 and the guide rollers 17 of an upper press member 16.As shown in Figures 3A and 3B, the label strip T consists of a backing sheet S coated with a separating agent and having a plurality of labels L, each of which is coated with an adhesive, detachably adhered continuously along its length.On the labels L of the thermal label strip T shown in Figure 3A is printed information I such as a bar code B representing a merchandise code or manufacturing code, a department code and a price. The backlng sheet S is provided with holes D which are for position detection purposes.On the labels L of the thermal label strip T shown in Figure 3B Is printed a parcel destination code I which corresponds to the bar code B of the slip number, and the backing sheet S is provided with holes D which are for position detection purposes. The holes D can also be utilized for conveyance purposes by engagement with the conveyor roller 19 Figure 2 . The thermal print medium is not limited to the said labels depending on how the medium is going to be used, tags or the like not coated with adhesive may also be used.The holes D can also be utilized for conveyance purposes by engagement with the conveyor roller 19 Figure 2 .Reverting to Figure 2, the thermal label strip T passes via the conveyor roller 19 to a thermal print head 20 and a.platen 21, is redirected at the platen 21 portion, where the labels L are peeled off, so that just the backing strip is directed back to engagement with the conveyor roller 19, guided by the guide rollers 23 of the lower press member 22, and the backing sheet S then feeds out from the main unit 2 via the discharge outlet 14. A bending pin P shown by a phantom line may be provided in front of the platen 21 to form the label peeling means which peels the labels L from the backing sheet S as the backing sheetS is redirected.The loading of the label strip T is accomplished by working the open close buttons 9 to allow the bottom cover 24 section, which includes the platen 21 and the lower press member 22, to swing downwardly about pivots 25, thereby making it possible to insert the roll of thermal label strip T. An v conventional type of opening closing mechanism may be used for this purpose, so details thereof are herein omitted. The conveyor roller 19 is driven by the stepped rotation action of a stepping motor M so as to move the thermal label strip T in the required direction for printing and conveyance. The main unit 2 houses a control circuit 26. This control circuit 26 is connected to the battery 27, an Interface 28 for data input from and output to external devices1 a ROM program memory 29 for communication and control programs, a RAM data memory 30, and the keyboard 6.The display 7, sensor 15, thermal print head 20 and stepping motor M are also connected to the control circuit 26 and are thereby controlled by the control ci rcut 26. The battery 27 is a rechargeable type and can be connected via the socket 13 to an external battery charger 31.Figure 4A shows the thermal label printer connected to a microcomputer 32 to allow data I O operations therebetween. Data can be transferred to the microcomputer 32 via the socket 12 and a cable 33.Figure 4B shows the thermal printer connected to a microcomputer 32 to allow data I O operations therebetween.Figures SA and SB show an acoustic coupler 34 being used to link the respective printers 1 to a host computer 37 via a telephone 35, by means cf a wired or wireless link 36.The operation of the first embodiment will now be explained with reference to an application for replenishing stock at a supermarket or the like.The operator carries the thermal label printer 1 and the pen scanner 11 to a merchandise display shelf or rack where he uses it to scan a shelf tag F, thereby inputting the merchandise code and other relevant data into the thermal label printer 1. The operator then uses the keys of the numeric pad 4 to input the quantity of merchandise to be ordered in order to bring the stock up to the desired level. The data being inputted is displayed onthe display 7 to enable its accuracy to be confirmed. The operator then moves on to succeeding shelves and repeats the same sequence of operations.The input data is temporarily stored in the data memory 30 so that after the task of inputting the order .ta has been completed, it can be transmitted to a microcomputer 32 or a host computer 37 via the interface 28 and the socket 12, as shown in Figures 4 and 5. The required labels may be printed out by the printer 1 after the input order data has been processed and the ordered merchandise has arrived.This Is possible because the merchandise codes, order quantity data and other such requisite Ynformstion are stored in the memory means 30, so that the the operator need only press the function key 5 marked PR, which causes the conveyor roller 19 to advance the thermal label strip T and activate the thermal print head 20 to print the labels L eHith the required bar codes B corresponding to the said stored information. Also, as the backing sheet S is redirected at the platen 21 the labels L are peeled from the backing sheet S and fed out from the main unit 2, so that each label can be manually taken and applied to the merchandise not illustrated .Thus the labels can be printed just by pressing the PR function key, eliminating the need to manually input each and every merchandise code and quantity data such as has been conventionally required. An application roller 38 shown by a phantom line in Figure 2 may be provided in front of the platen 21 if large numbers of labels need to be applied.The printer according to this invention will now be described with reference to the reduced price selling of merchandise at closing time by supermarket tenant stores, such as butchers, greengrocers and the like. Conventionally, such stores have employed a measuring printer or like means to weight their merchandise beforehand and apply labels thereto printed with prices corresponding to the measured weight. However, when closing time approaches, such stores cut their prices in order to clear their stock that day, as the value of such merchandise lies in how fresh it is.However, because the conventional measuring printers are located in a merchandise arrival area or other specified location, it has been necessary to check the freshness of the merchandise or the state of zany damage thereto while printing out the labels, which is troublesome. In addition, it made it difficult to collect price data on merchandise that had been reduced in price for such selling, thereby causing problems between tenants and the supermarket owner when rents were calcuiated. With the present printer 1, the pen scanner 11 can be used to scan a printed bar code corresponding to a price reduced to a preset level, or the reduced price input via the numeric pad 4, for printing on a label L which is. then affixed to the merchandise to indicate the reduced price, while at the same time the reduced price data is stored in the data memory 30 for subsequent uploading to a microcomputer 32 or host computer 37 where the reduced price data can be processed into slips, providing accurate handling of such data, and thereby minimizing disputes with the supermarket owner.The operation of the second embodiment will now be explained with reference to Figures 6 and 7.Parcels coming from the despatcher are already printed with the slip number bar code B. The thermal printer according to the present invention is used at the stage prior to the sorting of the parcels by destination area to provide each parcel with a destination code I in a numeric form that can be understood by the sorter and which corresponds to the said bar code B. nuts, slip number, destination and other necessary information is input into the microcomputer 32 or the host computer 37 at the parcel col lemon stage, and at the stage prior to the sorting the printer 1 receives fr tne microcomputer 32 or host computer 37 in the form of computer data the slip number I and the corresponding bar code B. Steps S1 to S6 show this process N indicates the order in which the data is received The data thus received is stored in a specific memory area M1 of the data memory 30. be sorter scans the slip number bar code B with the pen scanner 11 to input the data into the printer 1. This input data is stored in a specific memory area M2 of the data memory 30 steps S7 and S8 . The numeric aa J is also used for input when necessary. The input data can be tHtsoia, ec on tne csp ay 7 for confirmation purposes. n steos SB to S17 It is determined whether the data slip numbers of parcels at the collection stage received from the computer matches the data tFar has just been read i.e. the slip number actually attached to a parcel . This matching is done in steps S10 and Sli If the data match, the control circuit 26 outputs a print command, the destination code I corresponding to the slip number is printed on a label L at the thermal print head 20 step S12 , and a label L is peeled from the backing sheet S by the bending of the backing sheet S at the platen 21 and fed out from the main unit 2 so it can be manually taken and stuck on the parcel, forming a destination code I indication so as to enable a sorter to see the code and sort the parcel accordingly.Instead of such sorting by the human eye, a destination bar code may be printed on the label L and read by a different scanner and sorted automatically. This is not illustrated. An application roller 38 shown by a phantom line in Figure 2 may be provided in front of the platen 21 if large numbers of labels are involved.When, owing to confusion, a parcel has gone astray and the expected reading is not obtained, or when a parcel that has been misrouted is read, the data is stored as non matching .data. Specifically, when a match is made with the data of the printed label, a flag goes ON stepS13 and when no match is made the flag stays in the OFF state. In the case of a misrouted parcel being read, so that the data input is determined as differing from the received dab in step S15, the read data that has been stored in the memory area M2 is transferred to the memory area M3 step S16 .On the basis of this read data it is determined whether a parcel is missing or the wrong parcel, and this information is stored in the memory and displayed on the display 7 or transferred to the microcomputer 32 or the host computer 37 for parcel error processing steps S19 and S20 .The structure of the thermal printer according to this invention can be simplified, if desired, by omitting the keyboard and providing only the pen scanner or a touch scanner as the data input means, and, further, by also omitting the display. In such a case another socket for input may be provided in addition to the socket 12 already describ ed. Where it is desired that the thermal printer according to this invention be easily portable, a fixed or detachable type handle not shown may be provided on the bottom of the main unit 2. Although a first embodiment of the present invention has been described with reference to an application for replenishing stock or reduced price selling1 the invention is not limited to these applications but can also be used for the input and output of data relating to various types of merchandise and other articles1 using a pen scanner1 keyboard or any of the various other kinds of data I O means, such data uploaded to and or received from a centraf computer and labels printed accordingly, and as such is widely applicable when labels have to be printed in accordance with various types of data transaction, all applications which could not be handled by conventional printers.Although a second embodiment of the invention has been described with respect to an application for despatching parcels, the invention is not limited to this application but can also be used for the input and output of data relating to various types of merchandise and other articles, using a pen scanner, keyboard or any of the various other kinds of dataI O means, for the comparison and determination of data received from a central computer for printing labels, and as such is useful for data indication for managing and keeping track of merchandise.In addition1 because when on the basis of the comparison it is determined that the data do not match, the data is stored temporarily in the memory and can be communicated to a central computer, it becomes possible to accumulate data on parcels which have gone adrift or have been erroneous sncluded. Thus. tne thermal printer according to this invention is able to print labels based on various data from various sources, and as such is therefore applicable to a wide range of tasks, many of which could not be handled Dy conventional printers. S me or the potential applications for the present thermal printer include leno v control of retail outlets, management of business data files, .printing of blood data cards and sample tube labels at blood banks, 8 ,nting of bar code labels for patient charts and medicai certificates at qos, .als and clinics, process parts and inventory control in factories, in tne tre Cnt business for the printing of confirmation labels at parcel rception despatch points, and for the management of customer data, and data and prlnting of labels relating to outside suppliers at department stores and supermarkets.
