# Dispenser device for liquids.

## Abstract
The spraying device for liquids comprises a piston pump which has a suction orifice intended to be immersed in the liquid and a piston rod slidably mounted opposite the suction orifice. This piston rod comprises an outward orifice for the liquid. The external case of the device comprises a delivery tube for mounting on the piston rod and carries laterally a nozzle for spraying the liquid, a trigger projecting outside the case for controlling depression of the rod of the piston pump and means for removably securing the case to the neck of the container. The case and the trigger are moulded as a single piece on a plastic material. The case has an opening which extends from the front face in which emerges the spraying nozzle to a rear face. The trigger is connected to the rear face of the case by means of a flexible tongue made from a plastic material which allows the trigger to be brought back from a moulding position where it is situated outside the case to a service position inside the case. The lateral spraying nozzle is free with respect to the case and the trigger, and the delivery tube comprises bearing surface for the trigger.
