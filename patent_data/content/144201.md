## Description
PLATE CLEANER FOR ELECTROPHOTO LITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING PLATE FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a plate cleaner for a lithographic printing plate which is made by an electrophotographic process BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION If an electrophotographic process is employed for making a lithographic printing plate, the printing plate can be easily made through only simple procedures of forming an image according to ordinary electrophotographic steps, and then wiping the copied surface of an electrophotographic photoreceptor with such a desensitizing solution also called etching solution as to render the non image area hydrophilic, that is to say, only procedures requiring no special techniques. For instance, photoconductive zinc oxide is coated together with a binder on a base paper which has previously been so treated as to have a water resisting property. The thus formed photoconductive layer is subjected to corona discharge or the like to gain charges electrostatically. Then, it is exposed to a light pattern in the dark, whereby charges in the exposed areas are dissipated and those in the non exposed areas remain. Thus, electrostatic latent image is created on the photoconductive layer. The latent image is developed by then spraying charged toner particles onto the photoconductive layer or dipping the photoconductive layer in an insulating liquid in which charged particles are dispersed, thereby causing the charged toner particles to adhere thereto by Coulombic attraction in an imagewise pattern. In general, toner particles used in a developer are coated with an oleophilic resin, and fixed to a photoconductive layer by a process of heat sealable adhesion or evaporation of solvent. Thus, the image part displays an oleophilic property due to the oleophilic resin coat of toner particles. In order to convert an electrophotographic copy obtained thereby to a lithographic printing plate, it is necessary for the non image part to be rendered hydrophilic. Such can be done, for example, in the following manner. When the copied face is wetted with a desensitizing solution which can convert certain substances into those having a strong affinity for water, e.g., a solution in which potassium ferrocyanide, potassium ferricyanide, ammonium phosphate or so on is dissolved, it is observed that a film of a waterinsoluble precipitate e.g., K2Zn3fFe CN 6 2, ZnNH4P04, etc. is formed in the part to be rendered hydrophilic by the reaction of the above described solute with zinc oxide which constitutes the photoconductive layer.The operation is very simple, since it suffices for the wetting procedure to simply wipe the copied face with absorbent cotton or gauze dampened with a solution as above described. Preferred desensitizing solutions are explained in detail in U.S. Patents 3,001,871, 3,592,640 and 4,208,212. When printing from a lithographic printing plate obtained by the above described procedure, the hydrophilic property of the non image part tends to deteriorate for one reason or another. Ink often sticks to such areas, causing so called background contamination.A typical cause of background contamination, though the contamination is attributed to a wide variety of causes, involves the drying of the plate surface after treatment for rendering hydrophilic. When the plate surface is dried, it happens that ink adheres to the dried areas in spots or over the whole plate surface at the time of printing. A phenomenon like this can be also observed when a printing machine is stopped in the course of printing on account of machine trouble or for the purpose of taking a rest. Another cause involves adhesion of oleophilic substances to an uncovered hydrophilic layer. In this case, the adhesion spots become ink receptive, and are turned into stains.Also, it can be attributed to a similar cause, viz., fingerprints, which have been left on the hydrophilic layer before treatment for rendering the non image part of the photoconductive layer hydrophilic, make their appearance at the background of printed matter. Hitherto, in the case of a typical PS plate which is the abbreviation of Pre Sensitized printing plate, that is to say, a lithographic printing plate to which photosensitivity is imparted in advance the stains can be removed by tripling with dampening water or an etching solution and thereby the plate surface can be restored to the original state to some degree. On the other hand, an electrophoto lithographic printing plate has a strong affinity for printing ink, and therefore the stains can hardly be changed for the better by wiping with an etching solution or a washing oil.In addition, although various kinds of plate cleaner have been provided for PS plates, application of such cleaner to electrophoto lithographic printing plates cannot reduce the background contamination due to their insufficient effect upon removal of the printing ink, and, what is worse, it happens that the photoreceptive layer of an electrophoto lithographic printing plate is destroyed by application of such cleaner to rather generate stains.Such being the case, cleaners fit for practical use have not yet been presented, and the advent of a plate cleaner specifically for use with an electrophoto lit.ographic printing plate s exclusive use has been ardently desired. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Therefore, a primary object of the present invention is to provide a plate cleaner for an electrophoto lithographic printing plate which can restore the plate surface from stains generated in the course of printing operations, stains due to fingerprints or ink left on the plate surface before or after the treatment for rendering the non image part of the photoconductive layer hydrophilic, or stains caused by scratches, and enables normal printing which is free from background contamination. As a result of extensive investigations, it has now been found that the above described object can be attained by using as a plate cleaner a suspension or an emulsion comprising as main components 1 an aqueous solution of a compound capable of producing a hydrophilic substance by reaction with zinc oxide, 2 a hydrocarbon solvent having an action of dissolving lithographic printing ink, and 3 a surface active agent. In addition to the above described principal components, the cleaner of the present invention may preferably additionally comprise the following components 4 a water soluble collidal substance, 5 a wetting agent, and 6 at least one compound selected from the group consisting of molybdic acid, boric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, polyphosphoric acid, and water soluble alkali metal salts thereof.
