# A pumpable composition for water purifying purpose containing iron II sulphate.

## Abstract
A pumbable water purifying dispersion containing iron II sulphate, the iron II sulphate being dispersed in an aqueous phase with a dispersing agent containing an alkaline earth metal and a basic anion. The best dispersion properties are obtained when the dispersing agent is calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide, whereby the resultant composition having a content of up to about 70 solid iron II sulphate, calculated as heptahydrate on the total weight of the composition, can be obtained and handled without difficulty. The aqueous phase can, to advantage, comprise metal ions active in water purification, such as Fe² Fe³ and Al³ . The invention also provides a method for producing the composition.
