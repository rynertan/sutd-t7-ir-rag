Display elements used in the past are usually formed by electrophoto conversion elements, and hence are of large power consumption. Further, the conventional display elements are readily broken by an external force and short lived Also there have been proposed display panels of the type employing display elements, each formed by a block member having a plurality of display surfaces of different colors, but these panels are defective in that the contents of displays cannot easily be changed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Fig. 1 illustrates an embodiment of a display panel of this invention, which is composed of a display surface structure 1, a display switching unit 2 and a drive unit 3. In the example of the display surface structure 1 such as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, letting N horizontal lines of arrangement spaced a predetermined distance LA from adjacent ones of them in a vertical direction be represented by al, a2 ..... aNX respectively, M display elements Dil, Di2, ... DiM are disposed on the horizontal line a. i l, 2, ... N at predetermined intervals LB in a horizontal direction. In this instance, the display element Dij j l, 2, ... M has a construction such, for example, as shown inFigs. 4, 5, 6 and 7 in which a four sided right prismatic member 4 formed as of a synthetic resin material has a heightH a little smaller than the distance LA and a width W a little smaller than the interval LB, has two pairs of opposed display surfaces d and d3 and d2 and d4 of different color displays, for instance, in red, blue, white and green, and has a square cross section. The display element Dij has embedded therein magnetic pieces ml, m2, m3 and m0 at the parralel edges between the display surfaces d and d4, between dl and d2 , between d2 and d3 and between d3 and d4, respectively. Each of the magnetic pieces ml, m2 and m3 extends vertically and its length jl 1 has a value close to the height H of the member 4. The magnetic piece m0 also extends vertically but its length Q 2is smaller than the length jl 1 The magnetic piece m0 is disposed centrally of the member 4 in the direction of its height, and consequently it lies opposite only the central portions of the magnetic pieces ml, m 22 and m3. The display element Dij has a bore 5 extending through the member 4 in the vertical direction. Further, the display element Dij has grooves 6a and 6b substantially triangular in section which are cut in the bottom 4a of the member 4 to extend across the bore 5 so that they intersect at right angles. In this case, the groove 6a extends, as viewed on the bottom 4a, in the same direction as the direction of extension of the display surfaces of d and d3, and the groove 6b intends in the same direction as the direction of extension of the display surfaces d2 and d4. The display surface structure 1 has a frame 7 for arranging the display elements D11 to D1M, D21 to D2 DN1 to DNM on the horizontal lines al, a2 aN, respectively. Between opposing upper and bottom panels 7a and 7b of the frame 7 are provided fixed shafts B1, B2, BN at regular intervals LB which extend vertically. Between opposing left hand and right hand panels 7c and 7d of the frame 7 are provided laterally extending fixed support plates C1, C21. ...C at regular intervals LA. In thiscase, the support plates C1 to CN extend through the fixed shafts B1 to BN, respectively.On the support plate Ci are formed projections 9 which extend from the side of the fixed shaft B. in the direction of extension of the support plate C. 3 1 in such a manner that they hold therebetween the fixed shaftB.. The projections 9 each have a width which permits sele 3 ctive reception of the grooves 6a and 6b of the display element Dij. The display element Dij is disposed on the support plate C. with the bore 5 receiving the fixed shaftB. through a sleeve 8 fixed thereto. The display element 3 Dij assumes its normal position where it lies on the support plate C. with either one of the groove 6a and 6b received by the projections 9 on the support plate C. However, the display element Dij thus disposed on the support plate C. 13 1 is rotatable about the sleeve 8 fixed to the shaftWhen the display element Dij lies in such a rotational position where its groove 6a is received by the projections 9 of the support plate C., the display surfaces dl or d3 faces forwardly. When the display element Dij is turned in this state, the groove 6a disengages from the projections 9 and then the groove 6b engages with the projections 9.In this state, the display surface d2 or d4 of the display element Dij faces to the front. An example of the display switching unit 2 has first erasing heads E1 EN, second erasing heads F1 X FN and writing heads G1 X GN, as shown in Figs. 1 and 10A. The first erasing head E. has three electromagnets 101, 102 and 103 arranged laterally in this order at intervals 2xLB, where LB is referred to previously in respect of Fig.2. Each of the electromagnets 101, 102 and 103, as shown in Fig. 11, comprises a magnetic core 12 circular in cross section and having wound thereon a coil 11 and magnetic plates 13U and 13L respectively attached to both ends of the magnetic core 12 so that they coextend in a direction substantially perpendicular to the lengthwise direction of the magnetic core 12. The magnetic core 12 and the magnetic plates 13U and 13L make up each of the electromagnets 101, 102 and 103. In the illustrated case, the magnetic plates 13U and 13L are spaced apart a distance substantially equal to. the length Q1 of the magnetic pieces ml, m2 and m3 of the aforesaid member 4 of the display element Dij in the vertical direction. The second erasing head F. has one electromagnet 104 as shown in Fig. 12. The electromagnet 104 comprises a magnetic core 22 circular in cross section and having wound thereon a coil 21 and magnetic plates 23U and 23L respectively attached to both ends of the magnetic core 22 so that they coextend in a direction substantially perpendicular to the lengthwise direction of the magnetic core 22.The magnetic core 22 and the magnetic plates 23U and 23L make up the electromagnet 104. In the illustrated case, the magnetic plates 23U and 23L are spaced apart a distance substantially equal to the length 2 of the magnetic piece mg of the aforesaid block member 4 of the display element D. in the vertical direction. 13 The writing head G. has three electromagnets 105, 106 and 107 arranged laterally in this order at this intervals of 2XLB. The electromagnets 105, 106 and 107 are each identical in construction with the abovesaid electromagnets 103 to 105 as shown in Fig. 11 therefore, no detail description will be repeated. A vertical rod 25 is provided behind the display surface structure 1 in a manner to be movable to right and left in parallel therewith. The first and second erasing heads E. and F. and the writing head G. are mounted on the 1 1 1 vertical rod 25 at a position opposite the aforementioned horizontal line a. in such a manner that the front end faces of the magnetic plates 13U and 13L of the electromagnets 101 to 103 and 105 to 107 of the first erasing head E. and the writing head G. and the magnetic plates 23U 1 1 and 23L of the electromagnet 104 of the second erasing headF. may lie adjacent the display surfaces dl to d4 of the display element Dij. An example of the drive unit 3 has, as shown in Figs.1, 10A and 13, a belt, chain or like strap member 28 installed between a pair of pulleys 26 and 27 disposed in the horizontal direction, for instance, on the lower side of the display surface structure 1 and spaced a predetermined distance apart and a similar strap member 31 installed between a pair of pulleys 29 and 30 likewise disposed in the horizontal direction on the upper side of the display surface structure 1 and spaced a predetermined distance apart. The vertical rod 25 of the abovesaid display switching unit 2 is secured at both ends to the strap members 28 and 31. A rotary shaft 33 of a motor 32 is coupled, for instance, to the pulley 27 and a shaft 34 is bridged between the pulleys 26 and 29 so that the strap members 28 and 31 may be driven by the rotation of the motor 32 to right or left in synchronism with each other.Accordingly, the vertical rod 25 is moved to right and left while being held vertical. The drive unit 3 has, as shown in Figs. 10A and 13, a detecting mechanism 41 for detecting the position of the vertical rod 25. An example of the detecting mechanism 41 has, as shown in Figs. 10A and 13, a position detecting plate 42 which is disposed on the lower side of the display elements .... DNM DNM to extend in the horizontal direction and whose front marginal edge has rectangular recesses R1 to RN The recess R. extends leftwards from 3 the position corresponding to the center of the display element DNj in the horizontal direction to a position spaced a distance equal to 1 2 of the interval LB from the abovesaid position, and a light emitting element 43 and a photo detector 44 which are disposed in opposing relationship to each other with the position detecting plate 42 interposed therebetween.The light emitting element 43 and the photo detector 44 are mounted on the supporting members 16 and 17 respectively planted on the vertical rod 25. The photo detector 44 provides a detected output 1 or 0 in the binary representation depending on whether the recess R. exists or not between the photo detector 44 3 and the light emitting element 43. In practice, the position detecting plate 42 has at least the aforesaid recessesR1 to RM and similar recesses RSl X R, The recesses Ras8, Rs7 Psl are formed in this order at the intervals LB leftwards of the position spaced the distance LB from the leftmost recess R1 and the recess Rs9, Rs10 ..... RS12 are disposed in this order rightwards of the rightmost recess RN at a position spaced therefrom the distance LB. Further, the drive unit 3 has detecting switches 51 and 52 for detecting the leftmost and rightmost positions of the vertical rod 25, respectively. The detecting switch 51 is adapted to provide an output 1 in the binary representation upon engagement with an engaging piece 53 of the vertical rod 25 when the magnetic plates 13U and 13L of the rightmost electromagnet 101 of the first erasing head E. mounted on the vertical rod 25 are moved out of the opposing relation with the display element Dil. The detecting switch 52 is similarly adapted to provide an output 1 in the binary representation upon engagement with an engaging piece 53 of the vertical rod 25 when the magnetic plates 13U and 13L of the leftmost electromagnet 107 of the writing head G. are moved out of the opposing relation with the display element DiM. Moreover, the drive unit 3 has a drive circuit 60 for driving the first and second erasing heads E. and F. and 1 1 the writing head G. of the display switching unit 2. The drive circuit 60 comprises, for instance, memory circuits H and H , address selector circuits I and I , output circuits J and J , a data processing circuit K and shift registers Q1, Q2 and Q3. The memory circuits H and H are designed to store information 0 and 0 , 0 and 1 , 1 and 0 or 1 and 1 , for selecting the display surfaces dl, d2, d3 and d4 of the display elements D11 to DN1, D12 to DN2 D1M to DNM of the display surface structure 1. That is, in each of the memory circuits H and H , N information of the display elements D11 to DNl are stored as first parallel information at a first address, N information of the display elements D12 to DN2 are stored as second parallel information at a second address, ..... and N information of the display elements D1M to DNM are stored as Mth parallel information at an Mth address.The N information making up the jth parallel information stored at the jth address selected by each of the address selector circuits I and I are read out one by one upon each occurrence of a read control pulse from the data processing circuit K. Each of the address selector circuits I and I is adapted to sequentially select the first, second, ...,. Mth addresses of each of the memory circuits H and H for sequentially reading out the M parallel information stored in each of the memory circuits H and H . The output circuits J and J receive and output the N jth parallel information read out of the memory circuits H and H , respectively. The data processing circuit K has two information input terminals xl and x2 and three information output terminals yl, y2 and y3 and is adapted so tht the information from the output circuits J and J may be supplied to the information input terminals xl and x27 respectively.Moreover, three shift registers Q1, Q2 and Q3 are provided and information from the information output terminals yl, y2 and y3 of the data processing circuit K are applied to information input terminals of the shift registers Q1,Q2 and Q3, respectively. The data processing circuit K receives the sequential information from the output circuits J and J to generate pulses upon each reception of the information, which pulses are applied as a read control pulse and a shift pulse to the memory circuits H and H and the shift registers Q1,Q2 and Q3, respectively. The data processing circuit K is also adapted to provide a reset pulse RP for resetting the shift registers Q1, Q2 and Q3. Each of the shift registersQ1, Q2 and Q3 has first to Nth digits and is designed so that the N information sequentially applied from the data processing circuit K are stored at the N digits, respectively, and are simultaneously read out thereof. Further, the drive circuit 60 has input terminals T1 and T2 supplied with the detected outputs from the aforesaid detecting switches 51 and 52, respectively, an input terminal T3 supplied with the detected output from the photo detector 44, output terminals Ol and 02 connected to forward and backward revolution input sides of the motor 32, respectively, output terminals OG11 to OG1N, OG21 to OG2N andOG31 to OG3N, an output terminal 03 and a power source switch S. The output terminal OGli is connected to the coil 11 of the electromagnet 105 of the writing head Gi, the output terminal OG2i to the coil 11 of the electromagnet 106 and the output terminal OG3i to the coil 11 of the electromagnet 107. The output terminal 03 is connected to the coils 11 of the electromagnets 101 to 103 of the first erasing heads E1 to EN and to the coils 21 of the electromagnets 104 of the second erasing heads F1 to FN. When the vertical rod 25 of the display switching unit 2 lies at its leftmost position to maintain the detecting switch 51 in its ON state, if the power source switch S is turned ON for a very short period of time, output signals are derived from the output terminals 01 and 03. While the output signals are obtained from the output terminals Ol and 03, if the detected output 0 in the binary representation is supplied from the photo detector 44 to the input terminal T3 after counting eight detected outputs 1 , then the output 0 in the binary representation is supplied to the input terminal T3 from the photo detector 44 in the state that the address selector circuits I and II, the memory circuits H and H , the data processing circuit K and the shift registers Q1, Q2 and Q3 are controlled so that information stored in the memory circuits H and H are supplied via the output circuits J and J to the data processing circuit K. At this time, N pulses CP are sequentially provided from the data processing circuit K and the shift registers Q1, Q2 and Q3 are sequentially shifted upon occurrence of each of the N pulses CP. The data processing circuit K provides at its output terminals yl, y2 and y3 information 0 , 0 and 0 , respectively, in the case of the information from the memory circuits H and H being 0 and 0 , and information 1 , 0 and 0 in the case of the latter information being 0 and 1 .When the information from the memory circuits H and H are 1 and 0 , the data processing circuit K provides information 1 , 0 and 0 at its output terminals yl, y2 and y3, respectively, and then if an output 0 in the binary representation is provided twice from the photo detector 44 in the above state, the information 1 , 0 and 0 at the output terminals yl, y2 and y3 change to 0 , 1 and 0 , respectively.In the case of the information from the memory circuits H and H being 1 and 1 , the data processing circuit K provides information 1 , 0 and 0 and then, if the output 0 is obtained twice from the photo detector 44 in the above state, the information at the output terminals yl, y2 and y3 change to 0 , 1 and 0 , respectively, and thereafter, if the output 0 is derived twice from the photo detector 44 in this state, the information at the abovesaid three output terminals change to 0 , 0 and 1 , respectively. The information thus obtained are successively stored in the shift register Q1, Q2 and Q3. Then, when the output from the photo detector 44 to be supplied to the input terminal T3 becomes lt , the information stored in the shift registers Q1, Q2 and Q3 are derived at the output terminals OG11 to OGlNt OG21 to OG 2N and OG31 to OG3N, respectively.And then, when the output from the photo detector 44 is altered to 0 , no outputs are provided at the output terminals OG11 to OG1Nt OG21 to OG2N and OG31 to OG3N At the same time, the shift registers Q1, Q2 andQ3 are reset and, as described above, the address selector circuits I and I , the memory circuits H and H , the data processing circuit K and the shift registers Q1, Q2 and Q3 are respectively controlled so that information stored at the next address is successively read out of the memory circuits H and H , and, as is the case with the above, the data processing circuit K is actuated and the information therefrom are stored in the shift registers Q1, Q2 and Q3, respectively.Then, when the output from the photo detector 44 is altered again to 1 , the information stored in the shift registers Q1, Q2 and Q3 are derived at the output terminals OG11 to OGlNt OG21 to OG2N and OG31 to OG3N res pectively, in the same manner as mentioned above and thereafter such operations are repeated. Further, when the detected output 1 in the binary representation is supplied from the detecting switch 52 to the input terminal T2, no output is obtained from the output terminals Ol and 03. The above is the construction of an example of the display panel employing the display elements of the embodiment of this invention. With such a construction, by turning on the power source switch S of the drive circuit 60 of the drive unit 3 for a very short period of time with the vertical rod 25 of the display switching unit 2 being located at its leftmost position to hold the detecting switch 51 in itsON state, the vertical rod 25 is moved to right. While the vertical rod 25 is moved rightwards, the output 1 is yielded at the output terminal 03 of the drive circuit 60, so that the erasing heads E1 to EN and F1 to F N are energized.By the rightward movement of the vertical rod 25, the electromagnets 101, 102 and 103 of the erasing head E. are brought to right into opposing relation to the display element Di one after another and then the electromagnet 104 of the erasing head F. is brought to right into opposing relation to the display element Dij. As a result of this, such operations as described below are selectively carried out depending on which one of the display surfaces d to d4 of the display element Dij lies on the front side of the display panel before the electromagnets 101, 102, 103 and 104 are brought to right into opposing relation to the display element Dij one after another, that is, Before Erasing , ultimately, the display surface d2 of the display element Dij is brought to the front side of the display panel. A In the case where the display surface dl of the display element Dij lies on the front side of the display panel before erasing The magnetic piece mg of the small length Q2 lies near the rear left edge of the display element Dij. By the way, the electromagnets 101 to 103 each have the pair of magnetic plates 13U and 13L spaced apart the distance corresponding to the length 1 larger than the length Q2 of the magnetic 2 piece mg, as described previously in respect of Fig. 11.On the other hand, the electromagnet 104 has the pair of magnetic plates 23U and 23L spaced apart the distance corresponding to the length 2 of the magnetic piece m0 and described previously in respect of Fig. 12. Accordingly, when the electromagnets 101, 102 and 103 move rightwards along the back of the display element D in succession, the display element Dij is not turned, whereas when the electromagnet 104 is brought to right across the display element Dij, the latter is turned through 900 in the clockwise direction in Fig. 13, bringing its display surface d2 to the front side. B In the case where the display surface d of the 2 display element Dij lies on the front side of the display panel before erasing The magnetic piece ml of the length Q1 lies near the rear left edge of the display element Dij. By successive confrontation of the electromagnets 101, 102 and 103 with the display element Dij, the latter is turned through 900 upon each confrontation with the former, bringing the display surface dl of the display element Dij to the front side, with the magnetic piece m0 lying near the rear left edge of the display element Dij. Accordingly, by the confrontation of the electromagnet 104 with the display element Dij, the latter is turned through 900, resulting in its display surface d, lying on the front side. C In the case where the display surface d3 of the display element Dij lies on the front side of the display panel before earsing The magnetic piece m2 lies near the rear left edge of the display element Dij. By successive confrontation of the electromagnets 101 and 102 with the display element Dij, the latter is turned through 900 upon each confrontation, bringing the display surface dl of the display element D to the front side, with the magnetic piece mg lying near the rear left edge of the display elements Dij. Accordingly, when the electromagnet 103 is moved rightwards across the display element Dij, the latter is not turned. But when the electromagnet 104 is brought into confrontation with the display element Dij, the latter is turned through 900, resulting in its display surface d2 lying on the front side. D In the case where the display surface d of the 4 display element Dij lies on the front side of the display panel before erasing The magnetic piece m3 lies near the rear left edge of the display element Dij. By the confrontation of the electromagnet 101 with the display element Dij, the latter is turned through 900 to bring its display surface dl to the front side, with the magnetic piece mg lying near the rear left edge of the display element Dij. Accordingly, the display element Dij is turned by successive confrontation therewith of the electromagnets 102 and 103.When the electromagnet 104 is brought to right to the display element Dij, the latter is turned through 90t to bring its display surface d2 to the front side. The above described operations are tabulated in Fig.14. By successive confrontation of the photo detector 44 with the recesses Ras1, Rs2 Ras8, R1, R2, Rs9, RS8 Ras12 after the vertical rod 25 starts its rightward movement, the photo detector 44 yields the outputs 0 in succession, which are provided to the input terminal T3 of the drive circuit 60.As described previously, upon each occurrence of the output 0 after the application of eight outputs 0 to the input terminal T3, the address selector circuits I and I , the memory circuitsH and H , the data processing circuit K and the shift registers Q1, Q2 and Q3 of the drive cricuit 60 are controlled to selectively energize the electromagnets 105, 106 and 107 of a selected one or ones of the writing heads G1 to GN of the display switching unit 2 in accordance with the memory contents of the memory circuits H and H .The electromagnets 105, 106 and 107 of the writing head G. are brought to the position opposite the display element Dij one after another in synchronism with successive generation of the abovesaid output 0 after the electromagnets 101 to 103 and 104 of the erasing heads E. and F. are moved across the display 1 1 element Dij In other words, the successive confrontation with the display element Dij starts with the state in which the display surface d of the display element Dij lies on the front side and consequently the magnetic piece ml stays near the rear left edge of the display element Dij. Accordingly, the display element Dij performs such operations as described below in accordance with the contents of the memory circuitsH and H , whereby a selected one of the display surfaces d to d4 of the display element Dij is brought to the front side according to the contents of the memory circuits H andH . E In the case where the contents of the memory circuits H and H are both 0 When the electromagnets 105, 106 and 107 confront the display element Dij one after another, these electromagnets are respectively supplied with outputs 0 , and hence they are not energized. Accordingly, the display element Dij is not turned, in consequence of which its display surface d2 remains on the front side. F In the case where the contents of the memory circuits H and H are 0 and 1 , respectively When the electromagnets 105, 106 and 107 sequentially confront the display element Dij, these electromagnets are supplied with outputs 1 , 0 and 0 , respectively, and hence only the electromagnet 105 is energized. As a result of this, the display element Dij is turned through 900, bringing its display surface d3 to the front side. G In the case where the contents of the memory circuits H and H are 1 and 0 , respectively When the electromagnets 105, 106 and 107 confront the display element Dij in a sequential order, these electromagnets are supplied with outputs 1 , 1 and 0 , respectively, and hence the electromagnets 105 and 106 are energized. Consequently, the display element Dij is turned through 1800 to bring its display surface d4 to the front side. H In the case where the contents of the memory circuits H and H are both 1 When the electromagnets 105, 106 and 107 confront the display elements Dij in succession, these electromagnets are all supplied with the outputs 1 , and hence they are all energized. In consequence, the display element Dij is turned through 2700 to bring its display surface dl to the front side. The above described operations are tabulated in Fig. 15. When the vertical rod 25 is brought right to its rightmost position to turn on the detecting switch 52 to derive therefrom a detected output 1 , the output is no more produced from the output terminal 02, stopping the motor 32 from rotating. In accordance with the display panel using the display elements according to the above embodiment of this invention, the display surfaces d2 of all the display elements D11 to DN1 D12 to DN2 D1M to DNM can be made to face forwardly and a desired one of the display surfaces dl, d3 and d4 of a desired one or ones of the display elements can be made to face forwardly. Accordingly, if the display surfaces d2, dl, d3 and d4 of the display element Di are previously colored, for example, in white, red, green and blue, respectively, a character, symbol, graph or pattern can be displayed in colors as desired. Such a display can be produced with a simple construction as a whole. Further, since the display element Dij has such a simple construction as shown in Figs. 4, 5, 6 and 7, the distance between adjacent ones of the display elements can be made small therefore, the overall apparatus can be simplified in construction and reduced in size correspondingly. Moreover, as the display element is free from power dissipation, the display panel does not consume much power and, in addition, as the display element is not readily broken by an external force, the display panel can be used without trouble for a long time. As will be appreciated from the above, the display element according to the foregoing embodiment of this invention can be applied to construct a display panel which includes a number of such display elements arranged in the same vertical plane and which is capable of providing a character, graph, pattern or like display without much power consumption and with a long life. Further, the present invention exhibits the advantages that the content of a display of a character, symbol, graph, pattern or the like can be changed by a single movement of the display switching unit 2 in one direction and that such a change does not take much time. In the foregoing embodiment of the present invention it is preferred that the writing heads G1 to GN of the display switching unit 2 be constructed so that those magnetic plates 13U or 13L of the electromagnets 105, 106 and 107 of the writing heads Gi 1 and Gi 1 lying on the side of the writing head G. may be of the same polarity.The advantage by this construction will be briefly described in connection with the electromagnets of the writing heads Go 1 Gi and G. Namely, in the case where the electromagnet 105 of the writing head G. is not energized but the electromagnets 105 of the writing heads Gi 1 and Gi 1 are energized, the electromagnet 105 of the writing head G. is not exposed to a magnetic field by the electromagnet 105 of the writing head Gi 1 and or Girl. This eliminates the possibility of erroneous activation of the display elements Dil to DiN. Next, a description will be given with reference toFigs. 16 to 19, of another embodiment of the display panel of the present invention. In Figs. 16 to 19, the parts corresponding to those in Figs. 1 to 15 are identified by the same reference numerals and characters and no detailed description will be repeated. This embodiment is identical in construction with the embodiment described previously in respect of Figs. 1 to 15 except that the display surface structure 1 has such a construction as described below. As shown in Figs. 16 and 17, a pair of rotary shafts 74L and 74R are rotatably provided at a predetermined distance on a substrate 72 to extend vertically. On the rotary shafts 74L and 74R are mounted pulleys 73L and 73R, respectively. A carrier member 71, such as an endless belt, is placed on the pulleys 73L and 73R. On the outer surface of the carrier member 71 are arranged the display elements D to 21 D21 to D2N DNl to DNM in the same manner as described previously with regard to Figs. 1 to 3. In thise case, as will be more apparent from Figs. 18 and 19, the display element Dij is mounted on the carrier member 71 through a support plate Cij corresponding to that C. des 13 1 cribed previously with respect to Fig. 2.The support plate Cij has the projections 9 selectively engageable with the grooves 6a and 6b of the display element Dij. On the other hand, the rotary shaft 74L is adapted to be rotatable by a drive mechanism 75 as desired and, consequently, the carrier member 71 is adapted to be endlessly movable laterally as required. Accordingly, the display surface structure 1 can be endlessly moved laterally. Furthermore, this embodiment is identical in construction with the embodiment of Figs. 1 to 15 except that the first erasing head Ei, the second erasing head F. and the writing head Gi, which constitute the display switching unit 2, are fixedly arranged in the order described previously in respect of Fig. 10A, as shown in Fig. 17. Moreover, the drive unit 3 is designed so that, upon moving the display surface structure 1 by the driving mechanism 75 in a lateral direction, the electromagnets 101 to 103 of the first erasing heads E1 to EN and the electromagnets 105 to 107 of the second erasing heads F1 to F N and the writing heads G1 to GN are energized in synchronism with the movement of the display surface structure 1, though neither illustrated nor described in detail. In consequence, the display surfaces d to d4 of the display elements D21 to D1 D to D2M DNl to DNM are sele cted as desired and face forwardly. In accordance with the embodiment described above with reference to Figs. 16 to 19, it is also possible to obtain the same advantages as those of the embodiment of Figs. 1 to 15. That is to say, the display surfaces d2 of all the display elements D1 to DN1, D12 to DN2 DlN to DN can be made to face forwardly and a desired one of the display surfaces dl, d3 and d4 of a desired one or ones of the display elements can be made to face forwardly.Accordingly, a character, symbol, graph or pattern can be displayed in colors as desired. Such a display can be produced with a simple construction as a whole. Further, since the display element Dij has such a simple construction as described previously, the distance between adjacent ones of the display elements can be made small therefore, the overall apparatus can be simplified in construction and reduced in size correspondingly. Moreover, as the display element is free from power dissipation, the display panel does not consume much power and, in addition, as the display element is not readily broken by an external force, the display panel can be used without trouble for a long time. The foregoing description should be construed as merely illustrative of the present invention and should not be construed in limiting sense. For example, the display element Di need not be limited specifically to the foursided right prismatic block member 4 with the four display surfaces d1 to d4 but may be a multi sided prismatic block member with plural P display surfaces of different colors.In this case, the magnetic pieces responsive to the first erasing head and the writing head are disposed in the block member near its P l edges and a magnetic piece responsive to the second erasing head is disposed near the remaining one edge and P l electromagnets are disposed in the first erasing head and the writing head correspondingly. Moreover, the length Q2 of the magnetic piece mO of the display element Dij need not always be selected smaller than the lengths Q 1 of the other magnetic pieces ml to m3. Besides, the structures of the heads E , F. and G. 1 1 1 and the magnetic pieces mg and m1 to m3 of the display element Dij can be modified from those employed in the foregoing embodiment if the first erasing head Ei and the writing head G. have such construction that acts on only the magnetic pieces ml to m3 of the display element Dij. Also it is possible to substitute the first and second erasing heads with permanent magnetic heads. It will be apparent that many modifications and variations may be effected without departing from the scope of the novel concepts of this invention.
