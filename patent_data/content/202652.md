# Microwave oscillator.

## Abstract
A microwave oscillator to be usable with anyone of chip FET or MMIC FET or package FET, by configurating the oscilla tion circuit that resonance circuit 4 5, 26 is connected to the gate 11 , an end grounded inductor 2 is connected to the drain 12 and the source 13 is connected to output terminal 10 , stable microwave oscillation is made.
