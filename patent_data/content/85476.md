Unless indicated otherwise, all temperatures are in OC. Equation 1EMI15.1 wherein R1, R17, Q and A are as previously defined, and W is 0. The reaction of Equation 1 is best carried out in methylene chloride at 250 to 400C for 24 to 96 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere. The product can be isolated by the addition of an aqueous acetic acid solution followed by extraction of the product into methylene chloride or direct filtration of a product of low solubility. The product can ordinarily be purified by trituration with solvents such as n butyl chloride or ether or by column chromatography. Further details of this reaction and the preparation of the carbamates of Formula III can be found in U.S. Serial No. 337,934, laid open as a priority document in support of our copending European and BritishPatent Applications of6 January 1983 claiming priority therefrom. Equation la below illustrates the preparation of the required methylpyrimidinyl carbamates and methyltriazinyl carbamates of Formula III in Equation I above.Equation laEMI15.2 wherein A and R17 are as originally defined. According to Equation la, a heterocyclic amine of Formula V is reacted with two equivalents of sodium hydride and excess dimethylcarbonate to form III. The reac tion is run an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at 25 C to reflux for 1 to 24 hours. The product is isolated by a adding about two equivalents of concentrated HC1 and water saturated with NaCl, and b separating out the organic phase and concentrating to dryness in vacuo. Literature references relating to the synthesis of heterocyclic amines such as V are given hereinafter. Compounds of Formula I, in which Q does not include Q 3, Q 4 or Q 5, may also be prepared by reacting the appropriately substituted benzenesulfonyl isocyanate or isothiocyanate with an appropriate aminoheterocycle, V, as shown in Equation 2. Equation 2EMI17.1 wherein R1, R17, W and A are as previously defined, and Q is Q 1, Q 2, and Q 6 to Q ll. The reaction of Equation 2 can best be carried out in an inert aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile at a temperature between 20 and 80b. A catalytic amount of 1,4 diazabicyclo 2,2,230ctane DABCO may be used to accelerate the reaction. In cases in which the products are insoluble in the reaction solvent, they may be isolated by simple filtration. When the products are soluble, they may be isolated by evaporation of the solvent and trituration of the residue with solvents such as l chlorobutane, ethyl ether or methanol and filtration. The benzenesulfonyl isocyanates of Formula IVa may be prepared as shown below in Equation 3, by phosgenation of the sulfonamide II in the presence of butyl isocyanate. The sulfonyl isocyanates of Formula IV may also be prepared, as shown in Equation 4, by phosgenation of the butyl ureas of Formula VI. Equation 3EMI18.1 wherein R1 and Q are as defined in Equation 2. The above reaction can be carried out by heating a mixture of the appropriate sulfonamide II , an alkyl isocyanate such as butyl isocyanate and a catalytic amount of a tertiary amine such as 1,4 diaza 2,2,23bicyclooctane DABCO in xylene, or other inert solvent of boiling point 135 to approximately 135 C. Phosgene cathen be added to the mixture over a 1 6 hour period until an excess of phosgene is present as indicated by a drop in the boiling point to less than 130 C. The mixture is then cooled and filtered to remove a small amount of insoluble byproducts. The solvent and the alkyl isocyanate can be distilled off in vacuo leaving a residue of the crude sulfonyl isocyanate, IVa, which can be used without further purification.Equation 4EMI18.2 wherein R1 and Q are as defined in Equation 2. The compounds of Formula VI can be prepared by stirring a mixture of the sulfonamides, II, anhydrous potassium carbonate, and n butyl isocyanate in acetone or methyl ethyl ketone at 25 800 until all of the sulfonamide has reacted. The products can be isolated by quenching in dilute mineral acid and recrystallizing the solid product. The compounds VI are then treated with phosgene and a catalytic amount of DABCO in refluxing xylene or chlorobenzene in a manner analogous to that described in Equation 3. Sulfonylisothiocyanates of Formula IV where W S can be prepared by treatment of sulfonamides with carbon disulfide and potassium hydroxide followed by the reaction of the dipotassium salt with phosgene according to the teaching of K. Hartke, Arch. Pharm., 299, 174 1966 . Alternatively, compounds of Formula Ib in whichW is S may be prepared by the reaction of the appropriate sulfonamide of Formula II with a heterocyclic isothiocyanate of Formula Va as depicted in Equation 5.Equation 5EMI19.1 wherein A, Q and R1 are as previously defined. The reaction of Equation 5 is best carried out by dissolving or suspending the sulfonamide and isothiocyanate in a polar solvent such as acetone, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate or methyl ethyl ketone, adding an equivalent of a base such as potassium carbonate and stirring the mixture at ambient temperature up to the reflux temperature for one to twenty four hours.In some cases, the product precipitates from the reaction mixture and can be removed by filtration. The product is stirred in dilute mineral acid, filtered and washed with cold water. If the product does not precipitate from the reaction mixture it can be isolated by evaporation of the solvent, trituration of the residue with dilute mineral acid and filtering off the insoluble product. The heterocyclic isothiocyanates which are used in the procedure of Equation 5 are prepared, for example, according to the method of Japan patent Application Pub Kokai 51 143686, June 5, 1976, or that ofW. Abraham and G. Barnikow, Tetrahedron, 29, 691 7 1973 . The synthesis of heterocyclic amine derivatives such as those depicted by Formula V has been reviewed in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds , a series published by Interscience Publ., New York and London, to which the reader is now referred for further information. Aminopyrimidines are described by D. J. Brown in The Pyrimidines , Vol. XVI of the above series. The 5,6 dihydrofuro 2,3 d pyrimidin 2 amines, the cyclopentaEd pyrimidin 2 amines, and the 6,7 dihydro 5H pyrano 2,3 d pyrimidin 2 amines, are prepared as described in our EP A 15,683. Synthesis of the furo 2,3 djpyrimidin 2 amines are described in our EP A 46,677. The heterocyclic amines in which A is a triazole ring are disclosed in our European PatentApplication No. 82303611.6. Pyrimidine and triazine amines in which Y is dimethoxymethyl or 1,3 dioxolan 2 yl are prepared as described in copending U.S.Application Serial No. 328,09 8. European Patent Application No. 206492.8 and British Patent Application 8234702 . Sulfonamides of Formula II, in which Q is Q 1 orQ 2, can be prepared by the sequence of reactions shown in Equation 6.Equation 6EMI21.1 EMI22.1 wherein R1 and W are as previously defined X is C1, Br or HS04 R24 and R25 are H, CH3 or C2H5 and R26 is H, CH3, C2H5 or CO2CH3. Reaction 6a In this reaction an o nitrosubstituted phenyl diazonium halide or sulfate is coupled with an appropriately substituted thiophene or furan in the presence of a catalyst such as cupric chloride. The conditions necessary for this transformation are described in Gomberg and Bachmann, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 46, 2339 1924 J. Johnson, J. Chem. Soc., 895 1946 and in J. Pharm. Soc. Japan , 90, 1150 1155 1970 . In cases where both the a and the S position of the thiophene or furan are available for coupling, both isomers are usually obtained with the a coupled product being the predominent isomer. These isomers can be separated by fractional crystallization or chromatography and carried on through the remaining three reactions of Equation 6.Reaction 6b The reduction described in step 6b is accomplished by treating a solution of the compounds ofFormula IX, in a solvent such as ethanol, ethy l acetate, or DMF, in a pressure vessel, with 100 1000 pounds per square inch of hydrogen at 80.1500 in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst such as 5 10 palladium absorbed on carbon. When the theoretical amount of hydrogen has been absorbed, the solution is then cooled and the catalyst is removed by filtration. The product is then isolated by evaporation of the solvent.Reaction 6c The diazotization and coupling with sulfur dioxide, described in step 6c, is accomplished in the following manner. A solution of the aniline of Formula X in a mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and glacial acetic acid is treated with a solution of sodium nitrite in water at 5 to OOC. After stirring for 10 15 minutes at OOC to insure complete diazotization, this solution is added to a mixture of an excess of sulfur dioxide, and a catalytic amount of cuprous chloride in glacial acetic acid at 0.So. The temperature is kept at 0 5 for 1 4 to 1 hour then raised to 20 250 and held at that temperature for 2 4 hours.This solution is then poured into a large excess of ice water, and the sulfonyl chloride products, XI, is isolated by filtration or by extraction into a solvent such as ethyl ether or methylene chloride followed by evaporation of the solvent.Reaction 6d The amination described in step 6d is carried out by treating a solution of the sulfonyl chloride ofFormula XI with an excess of. anhydrous ammonia in a solvent such as ethyl ether or methylene chloride at 0 250C. If the product sulfonamide, II, is insoluble, it may be isolated by filtration followed by washing out the salts with water. If the product sulfonamide is soluble in the reaction solution, it may be iso lated by filtering off the precipitated ammonium chloride and evaporation of the solvent. Sulfonamides of Formula IIa can be chlorinated or brominated on the thiophene or furan ring by procedures well known in the art. These halogenated sulfonamides may then be reacted with sodium methoxide in methanol or sodium ethoxide in ethanol to replace the halogen atom with a methoxy or ethoxy group. Alternatively, the substituted nitrobenzenes ofFormula IX can be prepared by the procedure shown inEquation 7.Equation 7EMI24.1 wherein R1, R24, R25, R26, and W are as previously defined. In the reaction shown in Equation 7, a furyl or thienyl copper compound of Formula XII is reacted with an iodonitrobenzerfe in a solvent such as pyridine or quinoline. The copper compounds of Formula XII are prepared by reacting the corresponding lithium compounds with cuprous iodide or cuprous bromide in a solvent such as diethyl ether. The detailed procedures for these types of reactions are described in the following references M. Nilsson and C. Ullenius,Acta. Chem. Scand., 24, 2379 2388 1970 C. Ullenius,Acta. Chem. Scand., 26, 3383 3386 1972 . Sulfonamides containing a tetrahydrofuran or tetrahydrothiophene group Formula II, Q Q 6 andQ 7 can be prepared by catalytic reduction of the corresponding furan or thiophene compounds as shown inEquation 8. Equation 8EMI25.1 wherein R1, R27, R18, R20, and W are as previously defined. Selective reductions of the type shown in Equation 8 are well known in the literature. The choice of catalyst, solvent, pressure and temperature for reduction of furans has been reviewed by Samuel Sevadesh in The Furans by A. P. Dunlop and F. N. Peters,Reinhold Publishing Corporation, New York, N.Y. 1953, pp. 674 713 and by P. N. Rylander in Catalytic Hydro genation in Organic Synthesis, Academic Press, 1979, pp. 227 234. The reduction of thiophenes is reviewed by H. D. Hartough in Thiophene and Its Derivatives,The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds Series, Interscience Publishers, Inc., New York, N.Y. 1952, pp. 167 169.

Sulfonamides containing a pyrrole group can be prepared by the sequence of reactions shown in Equation 12. Equation 12EMI31.1 wherein Q isEMI31.2 R1, R27, R28, R18, and R19 are as previously defined. Reaction 12a The lithio compounds of Formula XXI are prepared from the bromo compounds of Formula XX by treatment with n butyl lithium at 800 in either hexane ether or hexane tetrahydrofuran solvent systems. The details of this type of transmetallation are further described by M. E. K. Cartoon and G. W. H. Cheeseman in J. Organometallic Chemistry, 212, 1 9 1981 .Reaction 12b The lithio compounds5 XXII, are immediately treated with at least one equivalent of sulfur dioxide at 0 to 500. After warming to 250, the lithium sulfinates of Formula XXIII are filtered off, and can be carried directly on to reaction 12c .Reaction 12c In this step chloramine is prepared at 00 by the addition of aqueous sodium hypochlorite to a stirred mixture of 30 ammonium hydroxide solution and diethyl ether. The lithium sulfinates of Formula XXIII are added to this mixture at 0 and the resulting mixture stirred at room temperature for 2 24 hours. The product sulfonamides are isolated by extraction into a solvent such as ethyl acetate and evaporation of the solvent. The sulfonamides of Formula IIk may be purified by recrystallization from solvents such as ethanol, l chlorobutane, or acetonitrile, or by column chromatography. The bromo compounds of Formula XX can be prepared by methods well known in the art, such as those reviewed by A. R. Jones and G. P. Bean in The Chemistry of Pyrroles, Academic Press, New York, N.Y., 1977. Sulfonamides of Formula II in which Q is Q ll can be prepared by the sequence of reactions shown inEquation 13. Reaction 13a The dilithio salt of Formula XVIII is prepared as described above in reaction lOa then treated with a ketone of Formula XXIV at 70 to 800. The temperature is raised to 250 for 1 to 3 days, and the reaction is then quenched by the addition of an acid such as acetic acid. The product, XXV, is isolated by evaporation of the solvent followed by chromatography or recrystallization.Equation 13EMI33.1 EMI34.1 wherein R1, R27, R28, R18, R19, R20, R21,R22, R23 and W are as previously defined and at least one of R27 R28, R18 or R19 is hydrogen. Reaction 13b Removal of the tert butyl group is accomplished by heating the above products, XXV, in trifluoroacetic acid at 720 for 1 6 hours. Dehydration of the tertiary hydroxyl group occurs simultaneously and the isomeric mixture of olefinic sulfonamides, XXVI, are isolated upon evaporation of the trifluoroacetic acid solvent. In reaction 13c , sulfonamides of Formula XXVII are produced upon hydrogenation of the olefins, XXVI, under standard conditions. The ortho heterocyclicbenzenesulfonylureas ofFormula Ia can be prepared by reacting the appropriately substituted benzenesulfonamide with an appropriate methyl pyrimidinyl carbamate or methyl triazinyl carbamate in the presence of an equimolar amount of trimethylaluminum according to the procedure of Equation 14. Unless indicated otherwise, all temperatures are in OC. Equation 14EMI35.1 where in A, R1, R17, Q , X, Y1 and Z are as previously defined. The reaction of Equation 14 is best carried out in methylene chloride at 250 to 400C for 24 to 96 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere. The product can be isolated by the addition of an aqueous acetic acid solution followed by extraction of the product into methylene chloride or direct filtration of a product of low solubility. The product can ordinarily be purified by trituration with solvents such as n butyl chloride or ether or by column chromatography. Further details of this reaction and the preparation of the carbamates of Formula III can be found in U.S. Serial No. 337,934. Sulfonamides of Formula II may be prepared by the sequence of reactions outlined in Equation 15.Equation 15EMI36.1 wherein R1 and Q are as previously defined. The compounds of Formula XXIX are prepared by analogy with the teaching of 3. G. Lombardino in 3. Org. Chem., 36, 1843. An N t butyl sulfonamide of Formula XXVII I is dissolved in an ethereal solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, and two equivalents of n butyllithium in hexane are added at 02So. After 1 5 hours at 0 25 , the compound of Formula XXIX is formed. This is not isolated, but one equivalent of a copper I salt is added at 20 to Oo , followed by 1 1.5 equivalents of an appropriately substituted heteroaromatic iodide XXX . The reaction mixture is then heated at 40 700 for 1 3 days, concentrated, poured onto aqueous ammonia, and filtered to provide the compound of FormulaXXXI.The reaction of Formula 15c is conducted by heating a compound of Formula XXXI with 2 10 equivalents of trifluoroacetic acid or aqueous HBr with or without an inert solvent at 30 700 for 1 3 days. The product II may be isolated as a trifluoroacetate or hydrobromide salt by evaporation of solvent and excess acid and trituration with ether. The free base may be obtained by neutralization of the salt with aqueous base, extraction into an organic solvent, and concentration of the organic extracts. The compounds of Formula XXX may be prepared according to methods known in the art, such as those reviewed in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds, a series published by Interscience Publ., New York andLondon, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.

They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly.Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about 0.1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid inert diluent s . More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Table XXVI Weight Percent Active Ingredient Diluent s Surfactant s Wettable Powders 20 90 0 74 1 10Oil Suspensions, 3 50 40 95 0 15Emulsions, Solutions, including EmulsifiableConcentrates Aqueous Suspension 10 50 40 84 1 20Dusts 1 25 70 99 0 5Granules and Pellets 0.1 95 5 99.9 0 15High Strength 90 99 0 10 0 2Compositions Active ingredient plus at least one of a Surfactant or a Diluent equals 100 weight percent. Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound.Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, NewJersey, but other solids, either mined or manufactured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed.,Interscience, New York, 1950.Solubility under O.1X is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at 0 C McCutcheon s Detergents andEmulsifiers Annuals, MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood,New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents , Chemical Publishing Co.,Inc., New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foaming, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E.Browning, Agglomeration , Chemical Engineering, December 4, 1967, pp. 147ff. and Perry s ChemicalEngineer s Handbook , 5th Ed., McGraw Hill, New York, 1973, pp. 8 57ff.

They can be used for broadspectrum pre and or post emergence weed control in areas where complete control of all vegetation is desired, such as around fuel storage tanks, ammunition depots, industrial,storage areas, parking lots, drivein theaters, around billboards, highway and railroad structures. Alternatively, the subject compounds are useful for plant growth modification, particularly in retarding the growth of undesired vegetation. Rates of application for the compounds of this invention are ordinarily determined by a number of factors, including their use as either herbicides or plant growth modifiers, the types of weeds to be controlled, weather and climate, the formulation to be used, the mode of application, amount of foliage present, etc. In general terms, the subject compounds should be applied at levels of around 0.001 to 5 kg ha, lower rates being preferred for lighter soils and or those having a low organic matter content, for situations where only short term persistence is required, or for plant growth modification. The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with any other commercial herbicide, examples of which are those of the triazine, triazole, uracil, urea, amide, diphenylether, carbamate and bipyridylium types. The herbicidal and plant growth modifying pro perries of the subject compounds were discovered in a number of greenhouse tests, the results of which may be seen in the following examples.
