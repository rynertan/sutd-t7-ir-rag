## Description
The present invention relates to a secondary ion mass spectrometer and more particularly to an improvement in the secondary ion mass spectrometer, which irradiates a solid sample with an accelerated positive or negative primary ion beam suitable for analyzing the composition of a metal or a semiconductor material, which draws secondary ions released from the surface of the sample into a detection system by means of an electrical potential between the sample and the detection system and which analyzes the target composition by mass separation. Conventional secondary ion mass spectrometer irradiates a solid sample with an accelerated positive or negative primary ion beam and draw secondary ions released from the surface of the sample by irradiation into a detection system by means of an electrical potential between the sample and the secondary ion detection system the extraction electrical potential , and analyzes the composition of the target on the basis of the secondary ions. Such spectrometers have been used to analyze the components and the composition of metallic or semiconductive material and particularly for analysis of microareas, trace analysis, analysis of depth distributions, and analysis of two dimensional distributions. In the case of analyzing depth distribution by means of this secondary ion mass spectrometer, the information for a depth distribution may be obtained by continually irradiating a single point or area of the target. In the case of multielement analysis information for the multi element may be obtained by successively measuring for each atomic mass in sample. Analysis of multielement depth distribution involves repetition of this operation. The mechanism by which secondary ions are formed in this secondary ion mass spectrometer is not well understood, but generally there is a tendency for elements having high ionization potential to become negative secondary ions, and elements having low ionization potential to become positive ions. Thus, we may measure for each element with high sensitivity as either a positive or a negative ion. However, the absolute intensity of secondary ion beam itself is meaningless because the intensity of secondary ion beam is highly sensitive to the surface state of the sample and the degree of the vacuum, etc. Usually, the intensity is expressed as the ratio of the intensities of secondary ions of the subject element to that of the matrix element, such as Fe in the case of steel material and Si in the case of a semiconductor material, etc. for example, I M I Fe , I M I Si , I Cl I Fe . etc. . The secondary ion mass spectrometer consumes a very small amount of the sample during analysis, but analysis is destructive. For that reason, it constitutes a characteristic feature that it is necessary to rapidly control the mass in the mass analyzing system for the secondary ions in order to obtain good results. However, the extraction potential of secondary ion is constant by force in prior art secondary ion mass spectrometers. Therefore, in the prior art, it has not been possible to detect secondary ions of opposite polarity at the nearly same time, because the polarity of detected secondary ions was fixed to be positive or negative and the polarity of the secondary ions of matrix element such as Fe or Si or the like had to be selected so that the secondary ions can be released easily. Nevertheless, in practice it is usually important in analysis to measure the intensity of beams of the secondary ions such as Cl or F or the like which ionize in only the opposite polarity. In this case, the following problems have arisen in prior art secondary ion mass spectrometers because the polarity of the extraction potential of secondary ions or the like could only be switched manually. 1 The polarity of many operating potentials, such as the extraction potential of secondary ions, the electrical potential of the mass analyzing system of the secondary ions and the electrical potential of the detection system, etc., must occasionally be switched and switching of the polarity takes much time. Accordingly, part of the sample is continuously being destroyed by irradiation with primary ions while the polarity is being switched, and information of the measurement is interrupted during this time, or the measurement process is delayed in cases where the primary ion beam is turned off during this time. 2 The deviation of electric field which results from switching the polarity also affects the primary ion beam, and the irradiative location may shift as shown in Figs. 10 and 11. Therefore, the primary ion beam may miss a targeted microarea, the image of a two dimensional distribution may also be distorted, and it is impossible to carry out analysis of depth distribution of both polarities at a single point. In Fig. 10 and 11, 10 represents a primary ion beam generation system which produces positive Fig. 10 or negative Fig. 11 primary ion beams 12, 14 and 16 represent a solid sample and a secondary ion beam released from the surface of the sample respectively. 18 represents a mass analyzing system which performs mass separation for the secondary ions comprising the secondary ion beam. The article by Gries et al in International Journal of Mass Spectrometer and Ion Processes Vol.59 1984 pp 339 342 discloses in using a mass spectrometer to compensate for the deviation of the irradiative location of the primary ion beam due to switching of the polarity is to shift the sample 14 after switching, but this is time consuming. Furthermore, it is necessary to equip the secondary ion mass spectrometer with an accurate apparatus for viewing the sample, such as an optical microscope or the like, and an accurate apparatus for slightly moving the sample. However, it has been difficult to view the sample and slightly move the sample by the conventional apparatus installed in the conventional spectrometer. It is therefore impossible to fully accurately correct the beam location. Furthermore, an additional problem has been that it was nearly impossible to switch the polarity repeatedly, because each polarity switching requires a lot of labor. On the other hand, it is known that secondary ions of both positive and negative polarities can be measured at the same time, but in this case two mass spectrometers or two mass analyzing systems for secondary ions are required. Therefore, such systems have the drawbacks of being not only exceedingly expensive, but also intricate and bulky. The present invention is to eliminate the problems in the prior art mentioned above. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a secondary ion mass spectrometer which can repeatedly and rapidly switch the polarity of the extraction potential for the secondary ions, the electric potentials in the mass analyzing system for the secondary ions and in the detection system and so forth, and which can accurately detect both positive and negative secondary ions from the same analytic area. Another object of the invention is to provide a secondary ion mass spectrometer which can automatically correct the deviation of the irradiative location of the primary ion beam due to the change in electric fields resulting from the polarity switching by a compensation device which modifies the voltage applied to a deflection plate for primary beam scanning in accordance with a beforehand obtained information of the deviation, whereby other compensation device are rendered unnecessary. In order to accomplish the above mentionned and other objects, a secondary ion mass spectrometer, according to the invention, irradiates a solid sample with a primary ion beam, draws secondary ions released from the surface of the sample into a detection system by means of an electrical potential between the sample and the dectection system, and analyzes the composition of the sample by mass separation of the secondary ions. A repeating switching device is incorporated with the secondary ion mass spectrometer, which automatically switches the polarity of all electrical sources or voltages influencing the polarity of secondary ions being detected. A compensating device automatically corrects the irradiative direction of the primary ion beam in response to operation of the switching device to compensate for deviation of the irradiative location of the primary ion beam on the surface of the sample due to the polarity switching in accordance with a beforehand obtained information of the deviation. With the foregoing arrangement of the secondary ion mass spectrometer, the secondary ions produced by irradiating the sample with primary ions are of both positive and negative polarities, and the positive or negative secondary ions are introduced into a mass analyzing system for secondary ions by means of a suitable potential slope applied between the sample and the analyzing system. Accordingly, we may reverse the polarity of the secondary ions drawn into the analyzing system by reversing the polarity of this potential slope. At the same time, we also need to reverse the polarity of the potentials in the mass analyzing system for secondary ions and in a detection system. In this case, the change in the electric field between the sample and the mass analyzing system affects the electric field between the source of primary ions and the sample, and the trajectory of the primary ion beam may change slightly. Therefore, the irradiative location of the primary ion beam on the surface of the sample also shifts, but we are not able to ignore this deviation because analysis of a specific microscopic area may be conducted in the secondary ion mass spectrometer. Accordingly, it becomes possible to alternate and rapidly measure either positive or negative secondary ions originating from the same place by compensating the change in deflection of the primary ion beam. According to one aspect of the invention, a secondary ion mass spectrometer comprises According to another aspect of the invention a process for performing mass spectrometry utilizing a secondary ion mass spectrometer comprises the steps of The predetermined correction voltage may be obtained by prior measurement of the deviation of the primary ion beam by means of observation of any one of the ion image, an optical microscope, a fluorescent plate or the like. The present invention will be understood more fully from the detailed description given herebelow and from the accompnaying drawings of the preferred embodiment of the invention, which, however, should not be taken to limit the invention to the specific embodiment, but for explanation and understanding only.

Referring now to Figs. 1 to 9, the present invention will be described in terms of the preferred embodiments of the invention. Figure 1 shows the preferred embodiment of a secondary ion mass spectrometer according to the present invention, which comprises a generating system 10 for the primary ion beam 12 composed of a plurality of deflection plates 20 which control the direction of propagation of the primary ion beam 12, and an electrical power source 22 for the deflection plates which applies a voltage to the plates 20 a mass analyzing system 18 for the secondary ions composed of an extraction electrode 24 used to draw secondary ions 16 released by the solid sample 14 irradiated by said primary ion beam 12 into the mass analyzing system 18, an extraction electrical power source 26 which supplies the extraction electrode 24 with an extraction potential E₀ α or E₀ α, an electrostatic lens 18 used to focus the secondary ion beam 16 drawn into the mass spectro analysis system 18 by the extraction electrode 24, an electrical power source 30 for the lens which supplies the electrostatic lens 28 with a lens voltage Eℓ, eletrostatic field plates 32 for energy separation of the secondary ion beam 16, an electrical power source 34 for the electrostatic field plates 32 with an electrostatic field voltages E The switching of the polarity by the switching circuit 48 is carried out by a relay that automatically controls switches, for example, the switch 26A for switching the polarity of the extraction electrical power source 26 shown in Figure 2, which controls the electrical supply polarity of the electrical power sources 26, 30, 34, 38 and 42. The switching circuit 48 also adjusts the voltage on the deflection plates 20 as described below. Let the mass number of positive secondary ions to be detected be labelled M1, M2 M1, M2 0 , and the mass number of negative secondary ions, M1 , M2 , M1 , M2 0 . Assume also that the extraction potential relative to the electrical potential of the sample, for positive and negative secondary ions respectively, is αV α 0 , as shown in Fig. 3. Furthermore, let the voltage on the deflection plates 20 in the x and y directions be E First, to measure positive secondary ions of mass number M1, the extraction voltage is set to α and the voltages on the deflection plates are set to E Secondarily, to measure negative secondary ions of atomic mass M1 , the extraction voltage is switched from α to α, the voltage on the deflection plates is switched from E Thus, it is possible to measure both positive and negative secondary ions alternatingly at the same position by simply repeating the voltage control process described above. Fig. 3 illustrated transitions between the operating states of the extraction voltage, the voltage on the deflection plates, the lens voltage, the acceleration voltage for secondary ions in the detection system, the electrostatic field voltage, and the polarity of the magnetic field for the preferred embodiment of the present invention. Examples of measurements performed by a mass spectrometer employing the present invention are described in detail below. In first example of measurement shown in Figs. 4 through 6, a sample shown in Figure 4 has KCl concentrated along its grain boundaries. In this case, K and Cl are detected as K and Cl respectively. First, when K is measured by the prior art method, the ion image shown in Fig. 5 is obtained from the scanning area A of primary beam shown in Fig. 4. Next, when the polarity of the extraction potential and so forth are all reversed and re adjusted, and the Cl ion image is measured the ion image shown in Fig. 6 is obtained. In this case, the irradiative location of primary beam and thus the scanning area were shifted to the area B as shown in Fig. 4. Comparing the ion images of Figs. 5 and 6, K and Cl seem to have been concentrated in different places. In order to compensate the deviation of the irradiative location of the primary beam by moving the sample itself, an apparatus to precisely move the sample by observing the ion image is required, and it is difficult and time consuming to carry out this very accurate compensation on each switching operation. However, if the present invention is employed, the sample does not need to be shifted at all and measurement of opposite polarities is rapid and very accurate because the switching of the polarities of all of the electrical sources and voltage attendant on the conversion of the polarity of detected secondary ions and compensate for the deviation of the irradiation point of the primary ion beam are carried out automatically. In second example of measurement, analysis of the depth direction of NaCl which separated out of Zn galvanizing is performed on the sample shown in Fig. 7. In this case, the sample set up so that the center of scanning area of the primary beam coincides with the center of the contaminant in prior art method. The primary ion is O₂ and acceleration voltage is 20 KV. Na and Zn were measured in the positive secondary ion mode. Then when the system was switched manually to the negative mode to measure Cl , the irradiative location of primary ion beam shifted 150 µm in the x direction onto the Zn region. Therefore, secondary ions of Cl appearead to be completely absent. The results are shown in Fig. 8. The accuracy of the analysis of depth direction was inferior because the measurement of the ion intensity of the secondary ion Cl was interrupted during the polarity switching, the intervals between measurement of the ion intensities of different secondary ions were relatively long, and therefore the resultant information was rough. In the case of Fig. 8, the depth distribution was about 200 nm. Furthermore, each time it was switched to negative mode, primary beam deviated from the target. Therefore, the results were that the Cl ion intensity was not measured at all and only Na appeared to have separated out of the Zn layer. This is contrary to the facts. In analysis of depth direction, the depth of penetration is directly proportional to the time of exposure to the primary beam, provided a uniform material. However, in the prior art measurement, primary beam impinges on the Zn layer in the negative mode and destruction of NaCl is interrupted during these periods. Consequently, Na separated material on Zn as a matter of fact, it is NaCl, but in prior art method, it must be concluded that it is Na. appears to condense to a relative great thickness. Then, the intensity of secondary ion of Na In the present invention, this compensation is automatically performed. Accordingly, the correcting voltages β The preferred embodiments of the present invention have been applied to secondary ion mass spectrometers of the magnetic field type, but the scope of application of the present invention is not limited to this and it should be clear that the present invention is similarly suitable for application to secondary ion mass spectrometers of the quadrapole type which have a low extraction voltage and have an easier polarity switching than magnetic types. As previously mentioned, not only can the polarities of all of the electrical sources or voltages taking part in the change of the polarity of secondary ions to be detected, be switched quickly, but also the irradiation location of the primary ion beam can be automatically corrected for any deflection accompanying the polarity switch over when the present invention is employed. Therefore, it is not necessary to compensate for deviation by slightly moving the sample, and it becomes possible to rapidly and accurately measure the secondary ion intensities for ions of opposite polarity at the same point. Thus, it is possible to quantitatively use the intensity of negative secondary ions, and the field of application of the secondary ion mass spectrometry can expand. Further, the present invention have the additional advantage of being easily adapted to existing prior art apparatus.
