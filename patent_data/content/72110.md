# Ink jet dot printer.

## Abstract
The ink jet dot printer comprises a head mounted on a carriage 10 movable along a platen supporting the paper and is formed by a plurality of tubes 24 and piezoelectric transducers 36 for ejecting the ink, which are supported by two parallel plates spaced from one another, between which a polymeriz able resin is cast to form a single block. The tubes are aligned in a single row F F in a direction inclined with respect to the printing line, in such manner that the distance between the ex treme tubes measured perpendicularly to the printing line is equal to the maximum height of the characters. On the outside of the front plate supporting the tubes 24 there is fixed a thin plate S1 bearing a row of nozzles U₀ U₁₉, each of which is aligned with the corresponding ejector tube 24. The expulsion of the drops of ink is obtained by means of the compression exerted on the tubes 24 by the piezoelectric transducers 36 activated in parallel by electric pulses generated by an energiz ing circuit under the control of a driving logic circuit by means of which it is possible to vary the scope of the printed charac ters and obtain bidirectional printing at high speed.
