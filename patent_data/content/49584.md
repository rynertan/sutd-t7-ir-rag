## Description
DISTILLATION SYSTEM This invention relates to distillation systems and in particular to distillation systems used in producing alcoholic beverages in which heat energy conswnp tion is reduced. Conventionally, as for example in the whisky distilling industry, distillation is carried out on a batch basis with heat energy being supplied to each distillation stage from an external source and with most if not all of this heat energy subsequently going to waste. In whisky distillation a batch of fermented wash is first heated and distilled in a wash still to produce low wines. A batch of low wines so obtained is then heated and distilled in a spirit still to increase further alcoholic content and produce a product spirit. In the case of each stage heat energy is supplied from a external source and substantially lost. It has been previously proposed to recover heat in distillation processes for other liquids, from the vapourized component in order to render the processes more economic an although some high strength potato spirit products, such as those derived from cereal or and molasses, are produced in this way by utilizing a continuous distillation or rectificationw process, i is not possible to use such processes for the distillation of lower strength alcoholic beverages traditiona2ly produced by the double batch still method without significantly affecting the balance of minor constituents or congeners which go up to make the relatively complex mixtures constituting alcoholic beverages.It will be appreciated that even apparently minor changes in the proportions of the congeners can substantially affect t t taste properties and hence t acceptability of the final product which can be particu larly serious in view of the very competitive nature of this field and the paramount importance. of taste. It is an object of the present invention to overcome or minimize one or more of the above disadvantages and in particular to provide a distillation system for the production of an alcoholic beverage in which net heat energy consumption i.e. heat supplied less useful heat recovered is reduced without significantly affecting the quality of the product. The present invention provides in one aspect a process for the production of an alcoholic beverage which process comprises a first alcohol distillation step wherein a first liquid having a first alcohol content is distilled to produce a first alcohol containing vapour having a second elevated alcohol content higher than that of said first liquid, which first vapour is condensed to a second liquid having a second, elevated, alcohol content, and a second alcohol distillation step wherein a batch of said second liquid is distilled to produce a second alcohol containing vapour which is condensed to a third liquid having a third, further elevated, alcohol content characterized in that the first distillation step is carried out in a continuous distillation column, the first alcohol containing vapour is compressed, and, if necessary, de superheated, so as to produce a saturated vapour, and at least part of the compressed saturated alcohol containing vapour passed through a heat exchanger through which heat exchanger is circulated at least part of a said batch of the second liquid r.avlr. a lover terlperature thac the conoensatior temperature of said saturated vapour so that heat is absorbed by said second liquid and at least part of said saturated vapour condensed to said second liquid. By means of the present invention a significant proportion of the heat emrloyed in the above mentioned distillation process can be recovered thereby reducing net heat energy consumption. The recovery of this heat energy is maximised by extracting in particular the latent heat of vaporization of the alcohol containing vapour and the efficiency of the extraction further improved by increasing the enthalpy and temperature of the vapour, at a relatively low additional energy cost, with the aid of a mechanical compressor. It will be noted that in the process of the invention the spirit still stage is substantially identical to that in a conventional distillation process so that the congener balance is substantially unaffected by the use of the process of the present invention instead of the traditional process. In the wash still stage now replaced by a continuous distillation system the temperature and pressure in the column can be carefully controlled to produce a wlow wines vapour having a particular desirec alcohol content normally corresponding to that of low wines obtained in the traditional batch type wash still.The pressure control is conveniently achieved in the process of the present invention by recycling a small part of the low wines vapour to the distillation column. The heat energy recovered may be used for a variety of purposes. Conveniently though it is used in another step of the process for the production of the alcohol containing beverage thereby providing a more or less integrated process or in a process for the production of a useful by product. Thus in the case of whisky pro duction the fluid circulated through the heat exchanger would most conveniently be the low wines being distiller in a spirit still. It will be appreciated that with a process of the present invention the low wines vapour is being distilled more or less continuously whilst the spiny still operation is carried out in batches. According to a preferred aspect of the invention therefore the saturated vapour is circulated selectively through alternate ones of the heat exchange means of a plurality of spirit stills for sequential distillation of different batches of said second liquid in said spirit stills. I Heat energy recovered could also be used in the reduction of the pot ale residue obtained from the distillation column which actually replaces the wash still stage in a conventional process , to a syrup suitable for use as an animal feed stuff additive.This may be effected directly, or indirectly by circulating water through a heat evaporator to produce steam which can then be used in a single stage or multi effect evaporator. In another aspect the present invention provides an apparatus for use in a preferred form of the process of the present invention which apparatus comprises a continuous distillation column having a lower end portion connected to a reboiler provided with a steam inlet connected to a steam supply for heating, in said reboiler, residual liquor from said first distillation step circulating through said reboiler and said lower end portion of said column, and an upper end portion provided with a fermented liquid inlet and a first alcohol containing vapour outlet, connected via a compressor, a desuperheating means, and valve means, to at least two heat exchange means arranged for heating batches of the second alcohol containing liquid being distilled in respective batch distillation stills, said valve means being arranged for selectively pressing said vapour to alternate ones of said heat ex x t z.ean . Further preferred features and advantages of the present invention will appear from the following description given by way of example of a preferred embouSment thereof illustrated with reference to the accompanying Figure which is a schematic circuit diagram of a malt whisky distilling plant. In tne plant, wash fror the fermented wasb Ptc r tank 1 is pumped by the wash feed pump 2 under the influ ence of wash feed flow control means 3 via a wash feed pipe 4 which conducts the wash through, in turn, a low wines cooler 5, a degasser vent condenser 6, a reboiler condensate flash heater 7, a pot ale wash heater 8 and a low wines vapour wash heater 9, so that, at the inlet 10 of the steam wash preheater 11 the wash temperature is in the range 870C to 930C. In the steam wash preheater 11 the wash is raised to a predetermined temperature value consistent with a controlled predetermined pressure value pertaining in the wash distillation column top such that the required alcohol composition in the overhead vapour is obtained. The control of this pre determined temperature is conveniently achieved by automatically modulating the steam flow to the steam wash preheater 11, by means of the temperature control valve 11a, which is activated by a temperature control loop 11b connected from the dis tillation column top to the valve lla via a controller means 11c. In the abovementioned heaters 8,9 and preheater 11, the first mentioned fluid is in each case the one supplying the heat to the second so that the temperature of the wash is progressively raised as it passes through said heaters and preheater. From the steam wash preheater 11 the wash is introduced into a degasser vessel 12 where non condensible gases, mainly carbon dioxide and air, are liberated from the wash and dispatched to the atmosphere via the degasser vent condenser 6, condensed liquor being returned from the oegasser condenser 6 via a condensate pipe 13 to the degasser vessel 12. The small amount of heat required to accomplish the degassing function is supplied by passing a limited proportion of low wines vapour as will be further explained hereinbelow to the base 14 of the degasser vessel 12 via a pipe 15. The wash column 16 is a generally conventional multi plate continuous distillation column and as the wash passes down through the column 1 , it is subjected to the stripping action. of the ascending vapours.On reaching the base 18 of the column 16 the wash is completely alcohol free and is substantially similar in nature and composition to the residual pot ale remaining after a conventional batch wash still distillation and is accordingly referred to herein as pot ale . The necessary heat for distillation of the preheated wash in the column 16 is supplied to the column 16 by introducing steam from a steam generator 19 into the shell side 20 of a reboiler 21, wherein on condensing of the steam, its latent heat is transferred to pot ale circulating through the reboiler 21 under the action of a reboiler circulation pump 22. The pot ale is discharged from the base of the wash column under the influence of a pot ale level control 23. Also at the upper end portion 24 of the column 16, in fact at the top 25 of the column 16, is provided an outlet 26 for the low wines alcohol containing vapour that has been distilled off from the wash passing down through the column 16. The low wines vapour issuing from the outlet 26 is conveyed by a low wines conduit 27 through, in turn, a knock out vessel 28 for removing any liquid that .a be present in the low wines vapour and is returned to the column 16 via a return pipe 29 a mechanical vapour compressor 30, conveniently electrically or steam pass out turbO alternator operated a de superheater 31 constit ted b an ir.ierWion means disposed fer injecting a smal aC urlt c7 liquid lov wines, from the downstream l Qaid wines circuit 32 described below, into the vapour wherein it is vapourised thereby reducing the temperature of any superheated low wines vapour sufficiently to obtain a saturated vapour which is readily condensable as soon as its temierature is reduced below its boiling ppint and three valve means 33 35 controlling respective branch portions 36 38 of the low wines conduit 27, which brays portions lead through the shell sides of three respective heat exchangers 39 41 to a low wines condensate conduit 42. Batches of low wines in liquid form are circulated through respective ones of the heat exchangers 3941 and respective associated spirit stills 43 45 with the aid of pumps 46 48. Whilst the distillation column 16 is normally operated more or less continuously, the batch stills 43 45 are operated alternately so that when distillation is taking place in one or at most two stills, charging, emptying or any other necessary operations may take place with the remaining still s . This is achieved by operating the valves 33 35 so that low wines vapour is supplied only to the heat exchanger s of the batch still s in which distillation is proceeded. The low wines condensate conduit 42 leads to a low wines buffer vessel 49. Since the heat contained in the low wines vapour is slightly in excess of the spirit still heating requirement, part of the vapour is conveniently directed, via pipe 53, to the low wine vapour wash heater 9, the condensed low wines therefrom then also running to the low wines buffer vessel 49 to combine with the remaining bulk of the condensed low wines and thence via the low wines wash heater 5 in order to extract more heat to a low wines storage tank 50. A small proportion of the low wines condensate is diverted via a de superhea supply conduit 51 to the de superheat means referred to earlier. In order to maintain a suitable pressure contrcl in the wash column 16 a small proportion of the low wines vapour is returned from the downstream side of the compressor 30 via a vapour return conduit 52 with a suitable pressure control means 53 as further explained hereinbelow. Further details of the method o, operation of the invention will appear from the following example of the operation of the above system. Example The above described distillation plant utilises three spirit stills, of which two are distilling at any one time and the third still is in the process of being either charged with low wines and feints or discharging spent lees. For each still, the distillation cycle time for a batch is 470 minutes and the cycle is split into two half periods of 235 minutes each. The first half period of the cycle comprises of the sensible heating of the low wines charge, foreshot fraction distillation and spirit fraction distillation the second half period comprises of the tailing fraction distillation. In the first half of the cycle, heat is supplied to the still at a constant rate the speed at which the spirit fraction is distilled determining the liesting rate.In the second half of the cycle the rate at which the heat is supplied to the still is also constant, but since the tailings distillation is essentially an alcohol stringing operation, the heating can be applied at a greater rate than in the first half of the cycle. Since the spirit still distillation is carried out in a traditional i.e. batchwise manner it will be appreciated that it is essential to sJmchronise the operation of the continuous distillation column with the distillation rate of the spirit stills such that the amour of lQV vines produce irom the wash column, is not only su,fic ent to satisfy the beat requirements of the spirit stills but is also desirably, for a practical operating form of process, sufficient in terms of quantity to provide adequately sized charges to be drawn in due course from the lout wines storage tank for subsequent spirit still aistillations. Therefore, the basis of the wash column m balance is dictated by the overall rate at which te spirit distillation is carried out and this in tr will vary according to the numbers of spirit stills which are simultaneously in operation and the rate at which the various fractions are distilled. Thus the three spirit stills are operated in sequence in such a manner that the time span for the first half of the distillation cycle on the No. 2 still 44 coincides exactly with the second half of the distillation cycle on No. 1 still 43 , and furthermore the time span for the second half of the distillation cycle on the No. 2 still 44 coincides exactly with the first half of the distillation cycle on the No. 3 still 45 , and sequentially the time span for the second half of the distillation on the No. 3 45 still coincides exactly with the first half of the distillation cycle on the Iso. 4 still 43 . Under this operational regime, twenty six spirit still distillations are processed in 101.833 hours per week by the application of h constant heat load supplied from low wines vapour emanating from the wash column. The total heat requirement for a batch spirit still distillation is 19,270,571 KJ. The operational time span for each still distillation is 470 minutes, which is split into periods of 235 minutes each. The heat requirements for the first half of the cycle 6,988,964 Ky or, translated into a heating rat of 1,784,264 KJ hour. The heat requirement for the sec niir half of the cycle 12,281,607 KJ or, translated into a heating rate of 3,135,463 Ky hour. Since th e synchro nisation technique requires the first half of the die tillation cycle on one still bo orate coincident in time span to the second half of the distillation cycle on a second still, the heat required to sustain the spirit distillation is the summation of the heat requirements for the two halves of the distillation cycle, which is 4,919,727 Ky4lou The low wines vapour flow of 2,533.7 Kg hour at a strength of 18.87 per cent by weight alcohol, and containing a latent heat of 8,149 KJ kg mole, will supply the spirit still heat exchangers at 5,100,138 Ky hour. As can be appreciated the above figure is in excess of the spirit stills heat requirement by 180,411KJ hour, and the relevant amount of low wines vapour can be diverted from the entry to the still heaters and utilised in the low wines vapour wash heater. The additional power requirement for the mechanical compressor and the various circulating pumps was 85 KWhr per hour which is approximately equivalent to 679,320 KJ hr. The heat energy requirement of the column was 5,671,099 K1. hr. Thus the total annual energy requirement of the above apparatus of the invention was 27.16X1O9KJ whilst that of an equivalent whisky output previously knowri system was 46.917x109KJ. This corresponds to an energy saving of some 42 . The above described process conditions have been chosen so that the continuous distillation wash column produces low wines vapour and subsequently low wines liquid in substantially equal amounts with substantially similar composition to those obtained using a conventional batch type wash still operation fro equal amounts of fermented wash in accordance with a preferred form of the present Even Even though in a batch type wash still oper i o. distillation is carried out essentially at at nos pheric pressure the vapour liquid equilibrium relationship constantly changes throughout the course of the distillation. As the alcohol is distilled and the amount remaining in the liquid bulk diminishes, the temperature of the distillation increases and thus the composition of the distillate varies being stronger in alcohol content at the beginning of distillation and weaker at the end. Using the continuous distillation colur it is desirable to operate the column at a substantially fixed temperature and pressure, which produces a low wines vapour having a substantially fixed composition the temperature and pressure being selected so that the tow wines obtained is substantially equal in quantity and composition to that obtained from the conventional batch still operation. In the above described embodiment the pressure in the column 16 is controlled by recycling thereto a small amount up to about 0.5 by volume of the compressed low wines vapour via the conduit 52 and pressure control 53 conveniently in the form of a V port pressure maintaining type of valve modulated by a controller 57 connected to a pressure sensor 58 in the distillation column top. The low wines being distilled in each spirit still 43 45 is also maintained under a back pressure as it is circulated through the heat exchanger 39 41, by means of a restricting valve 55 or orifice in the pipe 54 connecting the top of the heat exchanger 39 41 to the spirit still 43 45 or by returning the low wines heated in the heat exchanger 39 41 to the bottom of the spirit still via an internally fitted pipe, so that the low wines liquid heated in the heat exchanger will not distill unt it actually re enters the spirit still. In an alternative iorr. of arrangement the heat exchanger s would be actually located vr t thin the spirit still s . The pressure level inside the shell side of the heat exchanger low wines vapour circuit part is dependent on the discharge pressure from the compressor 30. The latter pressure is normally set at a fiyed level. The pressure in the low wines buffer vessel 49 is substantially equalized with the level in the rest of the system, so that condensed low wines can simply run through the condensate conduit 42 under the influence of gravity so the buffer vessel, by means of the provision of a small bore pressure equalization pipe 56 extending between the top of the low wines buffer vessel 49 and the downstream side of the compressor 30.
