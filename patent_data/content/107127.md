## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING POLYOLEFIN This invention relates to a method for inhibiting the build up of polymers on the wall of the poly he merization vessel in a process of7hso called slurry polymerization in which at least one olefin is polymerized in the liquid phase in the presence of a catalyst to produce a polyolefin substantially insoluble in said liquid phase. In the slurry polymerization the difficulties resulting from the build up of polymers on or the adhe the sion of polymers to the wall ofrpolymerization vessel lie in the a significant reduction in polymerization capacity of the the polymerization vessel due to the decrease in rate the of heat removal through the wall oflpolymerization vessel and, in extreme cases, in the repletion of the polymerization vessel with a bulk polymer. The present inventors conducted an extensive study on the prevention of the adhesion of polymer to the the wall oftpolymerization vessel. As a result, they accomplished the present invention which is predicated upon the finding that in the olefin polymerization by use of a solid catalyst component containing at least one transition metal compound, the adhesion of polymers can be prevented by reducing the effect of the catalyst on the adhesion of polymers, polishing the wall of,the, zation vessel, optimizing the state of flow of the polymerization mixture, and adding an antistatic agent to the polymerization system. An object of this invention is to provide a method for preventing the adhesion of polymers to the the wall of polymerisation vessel in a process for producing a polyolefin by slurry polymerization. According to this invention, there is provided a method for preventing the adhesion ofpolymers to the the wall of polymerization vessel in a process for producing a polyolefin, in which at least one olefin is polymerized in the liquid phase in the presence of a catalyst system comprising a solid catalyst component, which contains at least one transition metal compound, and an organoaluminum compound to fqrm a polyolefin substantially insoluble in said liquid phase The method comprises carrying out said polymerization under the following conditions 1 said solid catalyst component is a solid compound prepared by contacting at least one transition metal compound with a solid magnesium compound, 10 by weight or less of the solid catalyst component being 2 ij or less in particle size, 2 the surfaces ofypolymerization vessel in contact with the polymerization mixture are finished to a surface roughness of 2.5 p or less, 3 the Reynolds number of the flow of reaction mixture in the polymerization vessel is maintained at 5 x 104 or above, and 4 an antistatic agent is present in an amount the of 0.1 to 50 mg liter based on the volume of liquid phase. The invention is described below in detail. The solid catalyst component used in this invention is a solid compound prepared by contacting at least one transition metal compound with a solid magnesium compound, . the proportion of fine particles, 2 p or less in particle size, being 10 by weight or less. A desirable solid catalyst component is a granular solid compound in which the solid magnesium compound is a solid product prepared by the reaction of an organomagnesium compound with an aluminum halide compound and or a silicon halide compound, the transition metal compound being titanium compound and or a vanadium compound. The catalyst described in U.S. Patent 4,223,117 is an example for an especially suitable catalyst. The organoaluminum compound used in this invention can be any of those usually used as a catalyst component in olefin polymerization. If the polymerization proceeds in the presence of the catalyst component dissolved in the liquid phase, it is likely that the formation of fine polymer particles which tend to adhere electrostatically to the wall, or the formation of membraneous polymer due to polymerization on the wall of the polymerizatioa vessel occurs. It is desirable, therefore, to wash the solid catalyst component to remove those constituents which are soluble in the polymerization medium.Examples of the solvents for washing are saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as porpane, butace, pentane, hexane, heptane, and octane, cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, and xylenes, and halohydrocarbons formed by the partial replacement of hydrogen atoms of said hydrocarbons with halogen atoms.The washing can be performed by stirring the solid catalyst component in a solvent for 10 minutes or more, preferably one hour or more, at room temperature or higher temperatures, preferably 800C or above. By using a washed solid catalyst component, it is possible to prevent more effectivelythe.adhesion of polymers and to reduce the amount of an antistatic agent. The proportion of fine particles in the solid catalyst component should be reduced, because the fine particles themselves and the polymer produced by them are apt to adhere electrostatically to the wall ofrpoly merization vessel. It is necessary that the proportion of fine particles, 2 p or less in particles size, is 10 by weight or less based on the solid catalyst component. The average particle size of the solid catalyst component is preferably 3 or more, most preferably 5 to 20 p. A solid catalyst component having such a particle size distribution can be obtained by controll the ing the formation oftsolid catalyst component and also by removing fine particles from the solid catalyst component by a suitable separation technique.When fine particles of 2 p or less in particle size are removed, it becomes possible to reduce the formation of a polymer of small particle size which tends to adhere to the wall theOf polymerisation vessel and to prevent the adhesion of polymers to the wall in the presence of a reduced amount of an antistatic agent. Many compounds and compositions are known as catalyst components for olefin polymerization.However, in the case of a catalyst system comprising a combination of an organoaluminum compound and a transition metal compound, used as soluble catalyst component, such as titanium tetrachloride, tetrabutoxytitanium, and vanadium acetylacetonate, there occurs vigorous adhesion of polymers to the wall ofxhpeolymerization vessel occurs the which cannot be prevented even under hreequired conditions specified in 2 , 3 and 4 of the attached Claim 1. According to this invention, in order to reduce the polymer adhesion caused by the catalyst, those ingredients which dissolve during polymerization and produce irregular polymers,are effectively removed from the solid catalyst component by washing. An even better result is achieved by removing from the solid catalyst component fine particles which promote the adhesion. In the present process, the flow pattern in the polymerization vessel is such that the Reynolds 4 number is maintained at 5 x 104 or above, preferably 9 x 104 or above. Such a flow pattern is realized by the the proper selection of dimensions of impeller, polymerization vessel and operation conditions. The wall of the polymerisation vessel should be finished to a surface roughness of 2.5 V or below. Such a surface roughness a is achieved by buffing or byvasurface treatment such as electrolytic polishing. It is also desirable to remove those obstacles which may give rise to dead spaces. In the present process, the antistatic agents to be added to the polymerization system are those compounds having sufficient solubilities in the polymerization medium to assure uniform distribution throughout the polymerization system.

Of the above examplified compounds, the most suitable antistatic agents are alkali metal salts of dialkylsulfosuccinic acids, particularly sodium di 2ethylhexylsulfosuccinate. The alkali metal salts of dialkylsulfosuccinic acids are advantageously used for the following reasons 1. they have low toxicity and weak odor 2. they are effective in preventing adhesion even when present in a small amount in the polymerization system 3. they scarcely interfere with the polymerization and 4. een if they contaminate a polymer7 they exert no adverse effect upon the physical properties of the polymer such as processability, mechanical properties, color, odor, etc. The anti static agents are added to the polymerization system in an amount of preferably 0.1 mg liter, more preferably 1.0 mg liter or more, based on the polymerization liquid phase. Although there is no upper limit, it is desirable that the amount be 50 mg liter or less, because a larger amount of an anti static agent would exert an adverse effect upon the polymerization activity. Olefins suitable for.the present process, are e.g. those having 2 to 15 carbon atoms such as ethylene, propylene, butene 1, 4 methylpentane 1, hexene 1, vinylcyclohexane, and styrene. However, the present process is used chiefly in the polymerization of ethylene alone of mixture of ethylene with an aolefin such as propylene, butene 1, pentene l, hexene l, or octene 1. The polymerization is carried. out usually at a temperature ranging from room temperature to 1100C, at which the polymer which is formed is sub the stantially insoluble in the liquid phase of polymerization system. The polymerization pressure is not critical but usually ranges from atmospheric pressure to about 100 atmospheres. The polymerization is carried out in the liquid phase it is possible to use as diluent aliphatic hydrocarbons such as propane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane and octane and mixtures thereof. It is also possible to employ the method of bulk polymerization in which the monomer itself serves as the liquid phase. Molecular weight regulators such as hydrogen and various organo metallic compounds may be added to the polymerization system.The polymerization may be conducted batchwise, or continuously, or in I series polymerization in which the polymerization proceeds in several polymerization vessels connected in series. The invention is further illustrated below by the . Examples, but the invention is not limited thereto.Reference Example 1 Synthesis of solid catalyst component A 1 Synthesis of solid magnesium compound Into a 5 liter glass flask provided with a stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a thermometer, which had been died under reduced pressure and flushed with nitrogen, was charged 2.5 liters 5.25 moles of n BuMgCl of a solution of n butyl magnesium chloride n BuMgCl in dibutyl ether. To the stirred mixture, was added slowly and dropwise through the dropping funnel 0.54 liter 4.6 moles of silicon tetrachloride to form white precipitate. During the dropwise addition, the flask was cooled so as to keep the temperature of reacting mixture at 300C. After completion of the addition, stirring was continued for one hour at the same temperature. The temperature was then elevated to 600C and stirring was continued for another hour.The reaction mixture was then cooled down to room temperature.

The white solid was covered with 1.5 liters of titanium tetrachloride and allowed to react at 1000C for one hour. After completion of the reaction, the solid product was washed 5 times with 2.5 liters of n heptane at room temperature and dried under reduced pressure to obtain a light brown solid. The solid was washed by dispersing again in 2.5 liters of n heptane and stirring 4 hours at 980C.The washed solid was collected by filtration at 800C and dried to yield 400 g of a solid catalyst component hereinafter referred to as solid catalyst component A . The solid catalyst component A showed an average particle size of 15 and contained 1 by weight or less of fine particles of 2 p or below in particle size.Reference Example 2 Synthesis of solid catalyst component B . A solid catalyst component hereinafter referred to as solid catalyst component B 1 was synthesized in the same manner as in Reference Example 1, except that a solution of isoamylmagnesium chloride iso AmMgC1 in diisoamyl ether was used in place of the solution of n BuMgCl in dibutyl ether and the temperature of the reaction of silicon tetrachloride with iso AmMgCl was 15QC, The solid catalyst component B showed an average particle size of 5 and the proportion of fine particles, 2 u or less in particle size, was 8 by weight.Reference Example 3 Preparation of solid catalyst component C . Fine particles of the solid catalyst component B obtained in Reference Example 2 were collected and designated solid catalyst component C . The proportion of finer particles, 2 ii or less in particle size, in the solid catalyst component C was 50 by weight.Examples 1 to 4 and Comparative Examples 1 to 6 Ethylene homopolymer Example 3 and ethylenebutene 1 copolymers other Examples a d ComparativeExamples were prepared in a 300 liter stainless steel reactor in the presence of those catalyst systems and under those conditions which were as shown in the Table.In the steady state, the organoaluminum compound, transition metal compound as catalyst component, hydrogen, butene 1 except for Example 3 , and butane were fed at a constant rate to the reactor and ethylene was fed so as to keep the reactor at a constant internal pressure. Continuous polymerization was carried out by withdrawing the reaction mixture at a rate corresponding to the rate of feed. The antistatic agent shown inTable was fed to the reactor so as to keep it at a constant concentration, shown in Table, in the liquid phase of the polymerization system. The polymerization temperature was maintained at 600C by controlling the temperature of cooling water in the jacket. The degree of polymer build up on the wall and the properties of the resulting polymer were as shown in the Table. In Comparative Examples 1 and 2, the polymerization procedure was the same as in Examples 1 and 2, except that no antistatic agent was added. As suggested by the decrease in U value of the reactor wall during the polymerization, the polymer build up on the wall was observed upon inspection of the uncovered reactor after completion of the polymerization. The polymerization procedures in ComparativeExamples 3 and 4 were the same as that in Example 1, except that the Reynolds number of the fluid flow in the reactor was decreased and the surface roughness of the reactor wall was increased by changing the method of polishing. In Comparative Example 3, after several the hours of operation, the withdrawal oflreaction mixture from the reactor became impossible. The polymerization was discontinued and the interior of the uncovered reactor was inspected to find the formation of a massive polymer. In Comparative Example 4, a decrease in U valve of the reactor wall was observed during the polymerization and the post inspection of uncovered reactor confirmed the polymer build up on the wall. In Comparative Examples 5 and 6, polymerization was carried out by using, respectively, titanium tetrachloride and tetrabutoxytitanium, both being liquid transition metal compounds, as catalyst components.After a very short period of operation, adhesion of a large amount of polymer to the reactor wall was observed upon inspection of the uncovered reactor. In Comparative Example 7, polymerization was carried out in the same manner as in Example 1, except that the solid catalyst component C was used. A decrease in U value of the reactor wall was observed during the polymerization and polymer build up was confirmed upon inspection of uncovered reactor.
