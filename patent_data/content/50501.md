## Description
This invention relates to a process for producing colored molded products of thermoplastic resin.More particularly, this invention relates to a process for producing colored molded products of thermoplastic resins characterized by using an organic polymer type colorant finely dispersible and miscible into thermoplastic resins, excellent in heat stability at the time of molding and good in surface gloss and transparent feeling after molding. It is well known that thermoplastic resins, in particular, polyolefins can be formed into fiber, rod, pipe, film, sheet, shaped article, bottle etc.having excellent physical and mechanical properties by various molding processes such as extrusion, injection moulding, blow molding, melt spinning and the like.However, since polyolefins are hydrophobic and chemically inert in their nature, they are difficult to color by dyeing or printing directly after molding.Thus, their colored molded products are usually produced by previously kneading various inorganic pigments into them and thereafter molding the mixture.In such a process of kneading for dispersion of inorganic pigments, however, the average particle size of dispersed pigment is not less than about 1 10 microns even when the effect of the kneading and dispersing is great, so that such a process is.not suitable for making very fine denier fiber products or molded products requiring surface gloss and transparent feeling. Further, in the case of reddish and yellowish color tones, the available pigments are limited in variety and high in price, which restricts the competitiveness and use field of the molded product. Further, although the use of various organic pigments is also practised in some cases, they have problems in point of compatibility with polyolefins, heat stability, light resistance and the like. These organic pigments are high in cohesive force and, as the result, the size of dispersed particles attainable of the pigment in molded products is still about 1 10 microns. On the other hand, a process which comprises mixing and kneading a polymer or polymer composition having functional groups capable of acting as fixation site of various dyestuffs with polyolefins to obtain a dyeable polyolefin composition and then molding and dyeing the composition is also frequently studied as mentioned in, for example, Japanese PatentPublication Nos. 22,523 67, 6,285 68, 25,953 79, 40,255 79, 1,302 80 and so on. However, such a process, comprising a forming and a subsequent dyeing, is practically applicable only to molded products such as fiber formed or film formed products and small sized shaped products for the reason of equipment and economicity and is inferior to the coloring process by mixing and kneading of inorganic pigment in respects of weather resistance, abrasion resistance, washing resistance etc. of the superficial dyed layer.Thus, its practical application involves a number of problems. The present inventors conducted earnest studies to overcome the above mentioned problems.As the results, it was found that a copolymer of ethylene and a monomer having basic nitrogen previously dyed with an anionic dyestuff can be dispersed into thermoplastic resins such as polyolefins as very finely as average particle size of the dispersed particles reaches 0.01 0.5 p. This invention is based on this finding. According to this invention, there is provided a process for producing a colored molded product which comprises mixing A 100 parts by weight of a thermoplastic resin and B 0.01 20 parts by weight of a dyed product obtained by dyeing, with an anionic dyestuff, a copolymer of ethylene and one or more monomer s having basic nitrogen copolymerizable with ethylene or a composition comprising said copolymer and a metal salt of an organic carboxylic acid, and then molding the mixture. The first characteristic feature of this invention consists in that the dyed product according to this invention can be dispersed into thermoplastic resins in a very fine state so that the molded product has a transparent feeling and a good surface gloss.The second characteristic feature of this invention consists in that the dyed product of this invention has so good a dispersibility that it is applicable to the coloration of all kinds of molded products ranging from very fine fiber for example, about 5 denier or stretched film having a thickness of about 10 microns to large sized injection molded products. The third characteristic feature of this invention conssits in that, owing to the use of anionic dyestuff extensively used in the general dyeings of wool, nylon and the like, the color tone can be selected at will, the coloration can be carried out in much more colorful manner than that with inorganic pigments and the colored product of this process is superior in weather resistance, abrasion resistance and washing resistance to the product of the process according to a molding and a subsequent dyeing. As examples of monomer having basic nitrogen copolymerizable with ethylene used in this invention, there can be referred to alkyleneimines such as ethyleneimine, propyleneimine, butyleneimine, l,l dimethyl ethyleneimine, l,l diethyl 2 methylethyleneimine and the like vinylpyridines such as a vinylpyridine, S vinylpyridine, Y vinylpridine, 2 methyl 5 vinylpyridine, 2 methyl 6 vinylpyridine, 2 isopropenylvinylpyridine and the like vinyllactams such as vinylpyrrolidone, vinylcaprolactam and the like N vinylcarbazoles such as N vinylcarbazole, N vinyl 1,2,3,4 tetrahydrocarbazole and the like acrylamides such as acrylamide, N methylacrylamide, N,N dimethylacrylamide, N,N diethylacrylamide, N tert butylacrylamide and the like and aminoalkyl acrylates The term acrylates 1 includes acrylate and metacrylate, hereinafter represented by the following general formula EMI5.1 wherein R1 represents hydrogen or methyl group R2 andR3 represent hydrogen or alkyl group having 1 4 carbon atoms and n represents an integer of114. Among them, particularly preferable are N,N dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, N ,N diethylaminoethyl methacrylate, N,N dimethylaminoethyl acrylate, N ,N diethylaminoethyl acrylate and the like. Further, as mentioned in Japanese PatentPublication No. 3,372 80, modified polyethylene copolymers obtained by the addition reaction of a lower alkylamine compound to a copolymer of ethylene and glycidyl acrylate compound are also included in the object of this invention. Said copolymer of ethylene and monomer having basic nitrogen are usually obtainable by continuously feeding ethylene and said monomer into a reactor kept at a temperature ranging from 50 0C to 3000C and at a pressure ranging from 300 atmospheres to 3,000 atmospheres together with a free radical catalyst or oxygen, as mentioned in Japanese Patent Publication No.6,194 78. Chain transfer agent such as propane and the like may be used for the sake of regulating molecular weight. Content of the monomer having basic nitrogen in said ethylene copolymer is 5 408 by weight, preferably 10 35 by weight. Melt index of said ethylene copolymer is 1 1,000, preferably 50 500. As said ethylene copolymer, there can also be used copolymers obtained by copolymerizing ethylene with the monomer having basic nitrogen and additionally with other copolymerizable monomer such as vinyl acetate, methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate or other unsaturated ester in an amount of 20 by weight or less based on the copolymer. In this invention, the copolymer of ethylene and monomer having basic nitrogen may be dyed with an anionic dyestuff directly. However, from the stand point of dyeing efficiency, it is more preferable to carry out the dyeing after previously mixing and kneading the copolymer with one or more metal salt s of organic carboxylic acid in a molten state to give a composition. The amount of said metal salt is 1 30 parts by weight, preferably 5 20 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the copolymer. In the sense of increasing the dye exhaustion, it is preferable to make said copolymer or said composition into fine granule or powder by a method such as freeze pulverization or the like prior to the dyeing. As said metal salt of organic carboxylic acid, there can be used the salts formed between the metals belonging to group IA, group IIA and group IIIA preferably group IA of the periodic table and one carboxylic acid or a mixture of two or more carboxylic acids selected from the group consisting of various aliphatic carboxylic acids preferably, higher aliphatic carboxylic acids having 10 or more carbon atoms , aromatic carboxylic acids and pyridine carboxylic acids.As particularly preferable concrete examples of said salt, there can be referred to sodium stearate, potassium stearate, calcium stearate, aluminum stearate, sodium laurate, potassium laurate, calcium laurate, aluminum laurate, sodium myristate, sodium palmitate, sodium oleate, sodium benzoate, potassium benzoate, sodium phenylacetate, potassium phenylacetate, sodium p tert butyl benzoate, potassium p tert butylbenzoate, aluminum p tert butylbenzoate, sodium salicylate, sodium terephthalate, sodium nicotinate, potassium nicotinate and the like.

Further, copolymers of ethylene and unsaturated esters having 4 8 carbon atoms for example, vinyl acetate, methyl acrylate, methacrylate, ethyl acrylate and the like , their saponified products, modified polyolefins obtained by graftmodifying said polyolefins with a small quantity of unsaturated carboxylic acid or its anhydride, and mixtures of said modified polyolefins and olefines are also included herein. In the second place, as thermoplastic resins other than said polyolefins and olefin copolymers, there can be referred to polyamide resins such as 6nylon, 6.6 nylon and the like polyester resins such as polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene tetephthalate and the like styrene resins such as polystyrene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer, acrylonitrile styrene copolymer, methyl methacrylatebutadiene styrene copolymer and the like and other various resins such as polyvinyl chloride, polymethyl methacrylate, polyvinylbutyral and so on. Among these thermoplastic resins, polyolefins and olefin copolymers are preferable. As the anionic dyestuff used in this invention, acid dyestuffs and metallized dyestuffs extensively used for dyeing nylon textile products and wool products are applicable. Further, in case that a copolymer of ethylene and an acrylamide is used or in some other cases, disperse dyestuffs may also be used.The amount of dyestuff to be fixed onto said ethylene copolymer or said composition of the copolymer and metal salt of organic carboxylic acid is advisably 1 50 parts by weight, more preferably 5 40 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of said copolymer or composition.As the dyeing methods, the same ones as applied to nylon textile products and wool products can be referred to, which include the heat treatment under acidic condition in the presence of aqueous dyestuff solution, the dipping in aqueous dyestuff solution followed by steam treatment, etc. In any of these cases, the dyeing is preferably carried out at a temperature not higher than the melting point of said copolymer or composition usually 80 10OOC for a time period of 10 1000 minutes. In this invention, said dyed product is added in an amount of 0.01 20 parts by weight, preferably 0.01 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of thermoplastic resin. In this invention, it is also possible and sometimes it is desirable to use one or more members selected from various additives such an antioxidant, ultraviolet absorber, plasticizer, antistatic agent, foaming agent and the like and various inorganic fillers such as glass fiber, calcium carbonate, talc, titanium oxide and the like in combination of appropriate quantities in accordance with usage, form and shape of molded product and with the molding process, for the purpose of more effectively exhibiting the function of the molded product. As the method for mixing said dyed product B and optionally added various additives and fillers into thermoplastic resin A in this invention, melting and kneading by means of extruder or Banbury mixer before molding can be employed. Aside from above, however, it is also possible to dry blend them simply with Henschel mixer or the like and then to introduce the mixture directly into the feeder of molding machine. According to this invention, a wide variety of molded products of thermoplastic resins made by molding such as spinning, stretching, extrusion, molding, blow molding, injection molding, pressure forming, vacuum forming and the like, such as fiber, rod, pipe, film,.sheet, bottle, shaped article and so on, can be colored in a colorful manner. It is also possible to combine such a colored molded product with other material such as plastic, paper, glass, metal and the like to give a composite material or a laminate.

Acid Yellow 110, an acid dyestuff. In any cases, the percentage of dye exhaustion was 99 by weight or more. 500 g of the above mentioned dyed product A,B or C was added to 10 kg of powdery polypropylene Noblen FL 800, melt index 9, manufactured bySumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. together with 10 g of Irganox Q 1010 phenolic stabilizer, manufactured byCiba Geigy Co. and 50 g of Tinuvin 326 benzo triazole type stabilizer, manufactured by Giba GeigyCo. as stabilizers. After homogenizing the resulting mixture by means of Henschel mixer, it was subjected to a continuous spinning by means of a spinning machine of 25 mm diameter extruder equipped with a 12 hole 0.8 mm diameter circular nozzle at a resin temperature of 260 C and at a wind up speed of 300 m minute or 1.5 hours.Then, by means of a continuous stretching machine, it was stretched at a temperature of 1100C, at a wind up speed of 400 m minute at a draw ratio of 3. In any case of dyed products A, B and C, no breaking of filament took place at all at the time of spinning and stretching, and there were obtained a strand of 15 denier filament quite excellent in surface gloss and having a color of red, green or yellow.

When the temperature had reached 500C, 0.5 g of acetic acid and 0.2 g of the same dyestuff as used in Example 1 were added. Then, the mixture was heated to 1000C and boiled for 30 minutes, after which the filament sample was taken out and washed with water. Subsequently, it was soaped with 600 g of 0.2 by weight solution of Monogen higher fatty acid sulfuric ester type surfactant, manufactured by Dai ichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co., Ltd. at 60 0C for 5 minutes, and then again washed with water and dried to obtain a filament sample dyed red. The ultimate percentage of dye exhaustion of this dyed filament was 64 . As measured by the same methods as in Example 1, its light fastness was 2nd grade and its fastness to rubbing was 3rd grade which did not satisfy the necessary conditions for, for example, carpet. Comparative Examples 2 and 3 Filament samples dyed green and yellow, respectively, were prepared by the same method and under the same conditions as in Comparative Example 1, except that the dye used in Comparative Example 1 was replaced with C.I. Acid Green 25 and C.I. Acid Yellow 110, respectively. In these dyed filaments, the ultimate percentage of dye exhaustion was 77 and 84 , the light fastness was 4th grade and 5th grade, and the fastness to rubbing was 3rd grade and 3rd grade. It is apparent from the comparison of the abovementioned Example 1 with Comparative Examples 1, 2 and 3 that, when the amount of dye ultimately contributing to coloration is on the same level, fastness to light and fastness to rubbing are both markedly better when a quaternary salt composition is previously made by reacting tertiary amine site with a dyestuff and then it is mixed and kneaded into polypropylene than when polypropylene is firstly spun and then dyed.
