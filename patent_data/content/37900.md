## Description
TWO LEVEL MAJOR MINOR LOOP ORGANIZATION USING CURRENT FIELD ACCESSFOR MAGNETIC BUBBLE DOMAIN DEVICESTechnical Field of the InventionThe invention relates to magnetic bubble domain device architecture and in particular to major loop minor loop configurations using current and field access.Background ArtVarious types of magnetic bubble domain propagation organization are known in the prior art, including the major loop minor loop configuration. The major loop minor loop configuration, such as described inU.S. Patent No. 3,618,054, consists o a plurality of first recirculating minor channels and a second joT channel.There are also two methods by which bubbles are propagated in bubble devices one is the usual field access type and the second is tre current or conductor access type. In field access devices, the propagation tracks are made of regular repetitive patterns of a specific structure, such as Permalloy elements or ion implanted contiguous disks.The pattern provides traveling potential wells in response to a rotating in plane field. Bubbles, in turn, are propagated by moving with the potential wells. In current access devices, the necessary potential wells are provided by a set of conductor patterns in which polyphase, usually two or three phase, currents are transmitted. The conductors are typically formed in multiple layers, insulated from one another and driven in a two or three phase manner. An example of such a device is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,460,116. It is also kn wn from U.S.Patent No. 3,564,518 to use an elongated conductor loop to cause enlargement of a bubble for detection, which is then detected on collapse. The combination of field access and current access devices on the same chip is known, for example, from U.S. Patent No. 4,157,591. Field access devices have the advantages of simplicity of fabrication, very low power dissipation on the chip and tolerance to localized defects in the storage area. One disadvantage of field access devices is slow speed, since generating the drive field at high frequency requires large voltage current products that limits the practical frequency of operation at about 200 kHz or so. Another disadvantage is that two orthogonal coils are required to generate the rotating in plane field adding volume and weight to the device package.Conductor access devices have the advantages of operation at higher frequency than field access and that no field coils are needed.Current access devices will have simpler, lighter and smaller packages.On the other hand, current access devices are therefore more complex to fabricate requiring at least two fine levels of lithography over the whole device area. They are consequently susceptible to certain defects that have catastrophic effect on the device such as electrical shorts between the two conductor levels.In field access bubble devices, the power dissipation occurs mainly in the coils that provide the drive field of the device. This is typically about 1 watt for 1 cm device area, running at 50 Oe drive at 200 kHz.Alternative bubble technologies such as current access devices where bubbles are propagated either using single phase or two phase current carrying conductors, the power dissipation is concentrated mostly in the propagation conductors constituting the minor loops. Unlike the field access devices, the minor loops are not required to be activated all the time the device is being accessed since their propagation conductors can be made separate from those of the major loops, the switches, and the detectors. The minor loops can be activated only to bring the desired block of data to the transfer switches connecting them to the major loop or loops and once the bubbles are transferred over to the major loop, the drive current in the minor loops are simply shut off.The major loops propagate the bubbles to the input or the output ports of the device for either reading and or rewriting them.The bubbles are propagated around the major loops back to the transferin switches connecting them to the minor loops where the block of data is restored to its original location. In a simple major minor loop organization of a square chip, the minor loops are activated, on the average, about N steps N2 is the device bit capacity . The major loop is activated 2N steps once around the loop . Thus, on the average the power dissipation in the minor loops is only one third of its peak value. The power dissipation in the major loop being small there are only 2N cells in the major loops versus N2 cells in the storage loops contributes very little to the device power dissipation and thus the average device power dissipation is essentially one third of its peak value.

The architecture provides a combination of field and current access schemes by which bubbles are propagated. The storage area of the device is preferably a field access pattern.A plurality of current access tracks are also provided in which bubbles are generated, detected, switched, and otherwise manipulated for the various active functions of the device. The field access part of the device could be conventional Permalloy, ion implanted patterns, or any other field access type structure. In the present invention it is an ion implanted contiguous disk. The current access part is preferably a two phase zigzag type conductor pattern.More particularly, the hybrid current access field access device according to the present invention preferably comprises a storage area composed of a number of reentrant loops. Connected to these loops on one or both sides are two phase dual conductor current access tracks. The connections are in the form of switches e.g. one or twoway transfer switches . The two phase major tracks are connected in turn to some other two phase tracks through switches again two or one way transfer or swap switches . A generator or a number of generators are connected to the two phase current access tracks.Detectors are also connected to the current access tracks either directly or through some switches such as replicator switches. Such a two level hierarchical configuration allows much lower power dissipation and faster access time than single level major loop minor loop organizations.Some of the elements of the hybrid current access field access device according to the present invention are 1. field access ion implanted storage loops 2. current access two phase dual conductor tracks 3. transfer switches between field access tracks and current access two phase dual conductor tracks 4. transfer switches between two dual conductor tracks 5. a generator compatible with the dual conductors and 6. a detector compatible with the dual conductors.Each of these features of the present invention will be described and illustrated in greater detail.Description of the Preferred EmbodimentTurning first to FIG. 1 there is shown a top plan view of a zigzag shaped conductor implemented on the surface of a magnetic layer capable of supporting magnetic bubble domains as is known in the prior art. The conductor carrys an electric current and generates a periodic potential energy profile shown in FIG. 2 in the layer of magnetic material. A traveling wave of potential wells can be generated by two such conductors that are spaced 1 4 of a period apart, each conductor being excited by an a c current which is 90 degrees out of phase with respect to the other. Such a device can thus be used to propagate bubbles.Since the zigzag conductor is an open structure and, thus, the potential energy profile slowly varies in the direction outward of the open portion of the conduc tor loops, the bubble may escape the propagation track. It is thus advantageous to confine the bubble motion to a well defined channel by some means such as a Permalloy rail that runs in the middle of the conductors.FIG. 3 shows a top plan view of a two level current access path with a Permalloy rail as is known in the prior art. The figure shows a lower level first meandering conductor 10 shown as a dotted line and an upper level second meandering conductor 11 shown as a solid line. The two conductors are offset in phase from one another.Along the line of symmetry of both paths is a Permalloy rail 12. Although the cross sectional view of the structure is not shown, thePermalloy layer is disposed directly above the planar layer of magnetic material in which the bubble domains are propagated. Above the Permalloy layer is a layer of electrically insulating material, followed by the lower level conductor layer, another layer of insulating material, and the upper level conductor layer. ThePermalloy layer can also be used for implementing a Permalloy structure for sensing of bubbles. The use of a Permalloy bubble sensor therefore requires no additional steps in fabricating the hybrid devices as compared to regular ion implanted devices.Turning now to FIG. 4 there is shown a top plan view of a current access field access magnetic bubble domain device according to the present invention including transfer switches for connecting the current access tracks with a field access track. By utilizing the four independent drives available in these devices, namely the in plane fields Hx, Hy and the currents in the dual conductors y I1, I2 one can achieve many switching functions between the field access and the current access tracks.FIG. 4 is a top plan view of a two level current access path withPermalloy rail together with field access tracks connected thereto by a two way transfer switch. The figure shows a lower level first meandering conductor track 13 shown in solid line and an upper level second meandering conductor track 14 shown as a dotted line. The lower level first meandering conductor includes extended portions 15, 16, etc., every two periods. The extended portion 15 and 16 each essentially consist of a hairpin type loop which is formed merely by extending one of the loops formed by the meandering conductor 13. Portions of the field access propagation paths 17 and 18 are disposed adjacent to the extended portions 15 and 16 respectively for transferring magnetic bubble domains therebetween, thereby forming a transfer switch.The operation of the two way transfer switch is as follows. With the bubble in the conductor tracks 14, the in plane field is permitted to rotate until it reaches orientation O i.e., the horizontal direction in the figure at the instant the field H 0, y and the in plane field is kept that way until switching is completed.The current 11 is increased while field Hx is decreased so that a field gradient is established to pull the bubble from the tip T of the ion implanted pattern and into the inside of the loop of conductor C1 location A . Field Hx is then reduced to its normal off value usually 5 to 8 Oe and is kept that way until bubbles clear the switch area. Once bubbles are transferred to the dual conductor track, they can be propagated by the current I1 12 in the normal fashion. Notice that the switching pulse amplitude applied to C1 could be considerably larger than the amplitude necessary for simple propagation in the conductor tracks.The specific timing of the transfer out sequence showing the relative amplitude and phase of the drives Hx, Hys I1 and 12 as described above is shown in FIG. 5. The switching in from the dual conductor track to the ion implanted pattern is performed as follows the bubble is propagated along the dual conductor track until it reaches location A inside the conductor loop C1 at which time I1 is at its peak and 12 O. I1 is decreased and Hx is increased thus establishing a field gradient to pull the bubble to tip T of ion implanted pattern. H attained its full amplitude as Il O. The bubble now on the ion implanted pattern is propagated under the influence of Hx and Hy in the normal fashion.The transfer out a nd transfer in sequences for the pattern shown inFIG. 4 is depicted in FIG. 5. Another switching function that can be performed is the swapping of a stream alternate bit bubbles with a block of data in the storage loops. The fact that propagation in the field and the current access tracks are independent make this a relatively simple operation. In fact, the bubbles in the current access tracks can be swapped with any arbitrary block of data in the storage loops. The rotating field is first activated so that the desired block to be swapped out is located on the tips of the loops T, T , T , etc. The data to be swapped in is propagated until the bubbles reach locations B, B , etc. Transfer out is performed to transfer the bubbles from T to A.The current is activated one cycle to bring the new data to locationA. Finally, transfer in is performed to bring the new data to T and the swap function is thus completed. A timing diagram of the swap sequence to perform such operations fc the device shown in FIG. 4 is illustrated in FIG. 6.Switching between two current access tracks Is made by rearranging the relative phases between the drive currents there are four independent currents, two in each track . FIG. 7a shows a top plan view of a transfer switch according to the present invention connect flung two tracks S and S , each comprising two meandering conductor tracks C1, C2, and C1 , I, respectively. The tracks C1 and C11 are shown by solid lines, and the tracks C2 and C21 by dotted lines. ThePermalloy rails that define the propagation channels are connected at the switch to define the switching channel.Numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, 1 2, 3 , 4 etc. are used to represent sequential positions of bubbles that correspond to the phases of the drive currents indicated by the same numerals. Under normal propagation conditions no switching bubbles can propagate in each track independently without interference. the phase relationship between the drive currents Il, I2, I1 , and I2 are illustrated in FIG. 7b such that the a c component of the bias, at the closest points in the two tracks, are out of phase.Corresponding reference numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, etc. are used to represent timing points. In other words, when location A has an attractive pole location A has a repulsive one and vise versa.In the transfer mode,such as the one depicted in a highly diagrammatic manner in FIG. 8, the currents Il, 12, Il , and 12 are arranged to effect the transfer of bubbles from S to S . The transfer sequence is made possible by the current timing diagram shown in FIG. 9.Using the timing sequence shown in FIG. 9, a bubble is propagated inS until it reaches A where I1 is at its positive peak. The currents in S , 180 degrees earlier, were frozen such that A is attractive.Current 11 is then reduced keeping 12 0 so that A becomes more attractive and the bubble transfers to A . The bubble is then propagated in S in the normal fashion. Now, bubbles in S can be left in place for as long as required, or can be propagated again starting with appropriate phase relationship with the currents in S for independent propagation. The transfer fromS and S is also possible with an analogous timing sequence to the one described above. A great deal of flexibility exists in this arrangement. Since the two tracks are independently driven it is possible, for example, to transfer a consecutive bit stream in S to alternate bit stream in S or vice versa. Rearrangement of data can be readily achieved by utilizing the transfer in and out along with forward and backward propagation. These features are useful in many applications.FIG. lOa shows a dual conductor replicator switch design according to the present invention. Under normal, non replication operation, bubbles propagating along dual conductor track S1 are transferred to S2 with no switching performed. The activation of the switch results in replicating the bubble from S1 into two bubbles, one bubble proceeding into S2 and the other bubble proceeding to dual conductor track S3.The operation of the replicator switch shown in FIG. lia is as follows. A current pulse of sufficient duration is supplied to conductor leads Q1 and Q2 such that a strong favorable field is generated inside loop L1 which stretches the bubble from S1 into a stripe domain. With the stretch current still applied, another current pulse is applied to conductor leads Q3 and Q4 to generate an unfavorable field inside loop L2 which severs the stripe domain into two parts. The lower portion of the severed domain shrinks back into a bubble in track S1 and proceeds towards track Sz as during normal propagation. The second or upper portion of the domain is propagated into track S3. The timing diagram of the currents to perform such replication is depicted in FIG. lOb. The design of the stretcher detector according to the presentInvention is shown in FIG. 11. By using independently driven long loop meandering conductors, a dual conductor stretcher detector can be readily realized. The two conductors C1 and C2 are labeled as In the previous figures, with currents I1 and 12 respectively.Gradual stretching and de stretching can be used for nondesctructive detection, i.e., to retain the bubble after detection.The sense element is made of a thin Permalloy layer, and can beImplemented on the same level used for the Permalloy rails in the propagation channels. The magneto resistance of Permalloy permits the sensing of bubbles as is well known in bubble technology.FIG. 12a illustrates a hair pin loop placed adjacent to a dual conductor track used to nucleate or generate bubbles according to the present invention. Conductor track C1 with current Il, and track C2 with current 12 is shown, along with the hairpin loop shown in a solid line with current Ig. In order to deliver the bubble to the meandering conductor tracks without a loss in the bi as margin, the nucleation loop also supplies an a c field which is synchronized with that in the dual conductor track. In other words, the current in the loop creates a continuation of the travelling potential well. The timing diagram of the currents in the nucleation loop relative to that in the dual conductors is shown in FIG. 12b. When the amplitude of the current Ig is large enough, as shown in the figure, a bubble is generated which is then propagated down the dual conductor track. FIG. 13 is a diagrammatic representation of a two level hierarchical major loop minor loop organization constructed with a hybrid field access current access propagation according to the present invention.FIG. 13 illustrates the organization on a square chip although the present invention is not restricted to that shape whose dimension on the side is about N circuit periods, so that the total storage capacity is N2 bits. The chip is subdivided into a number n of major minor loop sets. In the figure, three major minor loop sets are shown. Each set contains N 2 minor loops, each has bits, and a first level major loop whose length is either 2N or N depending on whether the major loop period is equal or is twice as large as the period in the minor loops. Each major loop is connected to the minor loops through two way transfer switches represented as small circles, the thedesign of which depends on the type of propagation circuit used in the major and the minor loops.Examples of the various switch designs suitable for the different propagation circuits are described above. The first level major loops are in turn connected to a supermajor or second level major loop through another set of two way transfer switches also represented as small circles S . The spacing between the switches on the super major loop is M which could be made equal to N but not necessarily so. The input generator and the n output detector ports of the devices are located on the super major loop. The minor loops, the first level major loops and the second level major loops are assumed to be operated independently of each other in fact, major and super major loops could be current accessed and the minor loops could be field accessed, or alternatively all of the loops could be current accessed.The following discussion will apply equally to these two embodiments. Although a two level hierarchical organization is shown in FIG. 13, the present invention is not intended to be limited to such. The arrangement of a three level or n level hierarchical organization is also within the scope of the present invention, as are architectures other than hierarchical ones.Returning now to the embodiment in FIG. 13, data is stored naturally in the form of blocks, each contains nN bits distributed among all 2 the minor loops, one bit each. Each block, by virtue of the chip, is subdivided into a number of sub blocks each containing nM bits.To access a sub block of data 811 contained in a block q , the minor loops are activated, on the average N steps, until B1 reaches steps, n 1 c switches Sl. B1 is transferred to the first level major loops, which in turn are N activated on the average z steps, until Bll reaches S . Switching is performed at S to transfer Bll to May.11 which is subsequently propagated to the detector, then to the annihilator and to the generator where the data can be altered, if necessary. B11 is continued to be propagated around the super major loop until it reaches S , meanwhile the major loop is activated, so that all can be restored to its original position in BI still located in Maj.1 3. h can now be restored into the minor loops via S by the reverse of the previously described sequence.When comparing the power dissipation of different devices, the comparison should be made taking into consideration the difference in their data rate. In other words, the comparison should be made between the energy dissipation in accessing and restoring a specific number of bits. Denoting the power dissipation in the minor and the major and super major loops by P1 and P2, and their frequency of operation by fl and f2 respectively, the energy per bit per step is EMI17.1 To reduce the power dissipation, the minor loops are made shorter relative to the major loops. This can be implemented in a square chip, or nearly square chip, by combining several major minor loop sets into the two level major minor loop chip architecture.The power reduction is achieved due to the reduction in the part of the operating cycle during which the minor loops are activated. In the two level major minor loop organization, the average energy dissipated in accessing and restoring a sub block of data is EMI17.2 First term in the equation above is the dissipation in activating the minor loops whose capacity is N2 a number of steps N . The second minor term is the energy dissipated in activating a major loop capacity N a 2 steps once to propagate B11 to S and the second time to run the reverse sequence also 2 steps. The third term is the dissipation in the super major loop capacity N to run N steps.The last term is the dissipation in the detector assumed activated to a high current level only during the detection of a block of length nt1. We now calculate the energy dissipation in accessing and restoring a block of data size in N capacity chip with simple major minor loop organization.EMI18.1 The first term is the dissipation in the minor loops activated N steps and the second term is the dissipation in the major loop activated N steps and the detector dissipation is the last term. In an all current access device 1 2 1.0 picojoules and and cdeg is4x104 picojoules. In a 1 M bit chip N 3 1000 and the chip dissipation in the detector and in the major loops areof the order of 10 3 that of the minor loops. Comparing. 1 and 2 , we find the ratio between the energy dissipation in the two level major minor loop is 1 that of the single major minor loop organization. This Is a considerable savings In the power of the memory system where a number of bubble devices are run in parallel to achieve large data rate output. The same savings occurs in hybrid type device field current where P1 1 watts and f1 200 kHz giving 1 5 picojoules. Again the power dissipation is dominated by that of the minor loops and the factor of reduction is n1 It is also worth noting that the energy dissipation in a hybrid organization will also be considerably smaller than the all field access type. The next look at the access time in the proposed organiration. The average time it takes for a sub block of data to reach the detector access time is given by Tacc Nt1 Nt2 nMt2 n 2 where tl, and t2 are the period of time of bubble propagation in the minor and the major loops, respectively. The time required to access and restore cycle time a sub block of data is equal to cycle n tl N t2 2 nMt2 As an illustration, consider a 1 M bit chip where N t 1000, and n 10, and N N 100. In the case where the n mfnor,major, and super major loops are all current accessed at a rate of, say 1 M Herz per second t t2 1 psec Tacc 100 500 1000 1600 psec We also consider the case where the minor loops are field accessed at a rage of 200 kHz sec., i.e., tl 5 psec. Tacc 2000 psec We compare above to the case of an all field accessed 1 M bit device with a simple major minor loop organization. N Tacc N tl 2 tl 1500 tl 7500 psec It is thus clear that this organization enhances the performance of the field current access devices as compared to an all field access one. In fact, the access in such a device is only slightly longer than an all current access device. This advantage is, of course, in addition to the significant reduction in the device power dissipation as described above. While the invention has been illustrated and described as embodied in a two level major minor loop organization using current field access for magnetic bubble domain devices, it is not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention.It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the magnetic bubble device according to the present invention can be manufactured with various lithographic technologies and different combinations of known process steps, and that the preferred embodiments illustrated here are merely exemplary. The composition, configuration, and distance between the guide elements, as well as their distance to the magnetic bubble layer, can be chosen depending upon the properties desired. These and other variations can be further ela borated by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention.The present invention is also not restricted to the specific magnetic materials and circuits described. For example, it may be pointed out that magnetic materials other than garnet, for example hexagonal ferrites or various crystalline compounds may be used. Moreover, the source, orientation, and frequency of the magnetic fields and electrical currents, and the static or dynamic nature of the signals applied to the device may be suitably selected as desired for a particular application. Without further analysis, the foregoing will so fully reveal the gist of the present invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily adapt it for various applications without omitting features that, from the standpoint of prior art, fairly constitutes essential characteristics of the generic or specific aspects of this invention, and, therefore, such adaptations should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalence of the following claims.
