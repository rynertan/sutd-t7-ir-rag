## Description
COPOLYMER EMULSIONFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a copolymer emulsion containing colloidally suspended therein a copolymer which forms an insoluble crosslinked network upon the application of energy which is resistant to hydrolysis in a caustic solution and thus is particularly useful in durably sizing textile yarns, providing a yam with desirable processing, textural and aesthetic properties. BACKGROUND OF ThE INVENTION In the processing of textile yarns to form fabrics, the sizing of textile yarns with polymeric materials to facilitate the weaving of the yams into fabrics is conventional. A protective siting composition is applied to the yam to protect the yarns from being abraded or damaged during fabric forming procedures, such as weaving. Typically, the sizing composition contains water soluble polymers such as polyacrylic acids, polymethacrylic acids, polyacrylamides, polyvinyl alcohols, starches, and modified polyesters, alone or in combination. Before subjecting such formed fabrics to a finishing process such as bleaching, dyeing or other wet processing steps, the sizing composition is removed because the sizing composition interferes with the finishing process by partially dissolving in the process water.Furthermore, the sizing composition tends to impart undesirable textural attributes to the fabric by providing a harsh handle or feel to the fabrics when the sizing composition is not removed from the fabric prior to the finishing process. Therefore, according to current conventional industry practices the sizing composition is removed before the wet processing finishing process of the fabric starts, which is a costly and time consuming procedure. Also, the removed sizing composition dissolved in water, either pose eco logical problems and require treatment of the waste water streams or have to be recovered by procedures which are very costly. There have been previous attempts made to provide a durable sizing composition, i.e. a sizing composition which avoids the need for removal prior to the finishing process. However, these durable sizing compositions have been generally unsatisfactory. In order to be acceptable for use in commercial production, a durable sizing composition must meet a number of exacting criteria. The composition must be applied using conventional textile slashing equipment and must protect the yam during fabric forming procedures. The durable sizing composition needs to be resistant to hydrolysis in caustic solution so it is not removed by or chemically degraded by caustic scouring operations, bleaching, mercerizing, dyeing, or other fabric finishing processes. At least 50 of the sizing composition, preferably at least 75 , must remain on the fabric after the finishing process.Further, the durable sizing composition which is present on the yams must be fuliy compatible with conven tonal dyes and finishing agents so that the fabric may be dyed and finished using conventional dyes and production processes. In addition, it must meet all of the foregoing criteria without imparting undesirable textural or aesthetic attributes, such as a harsh handle or feel. To impart a desirable soft handle or feel to the fabric the copolymers in the sizing composition must have a Tg of less than 0 C, with Tg glass transition temperature being the temperature at which a polymer changes from a hard, brittle material to a soft, rubber like or plastic state. Prior attempts at producing a durable sizing composition have generally not satisfied the foregoing exacting criteria and have therefore not been acceptable for use in commercial operations, except perhaps in certain very speciaiized applications Typically, the prior approaches have involved attempts to use conventional non durable sizing agents, and to cause them to become permanently bound to the yam through the use of a crosslinking agent. This approach is described, for example, inU.S. Patents 3,676,207 and 3,666,400, and in European patent application 57,985.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Briefly, the present invention provides an aqueous copolymer emulsion containing colloidally suspended therein a copolymer which forms an insoluble crosslinked network upon the application of energy and which is resistant to hydrolysis in a caustic solution and thus is particularly suitable for use as a durable sizing composition. The emulsion copolymer comprises 50 to 95 of a softening monomer, 0.5 to 10 of a latent crosslinking monomer, 0.01 to 0.5 of an active crosslinking monomer, 0.5 to 5 of an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid and from 0 to 35 of a hardening monomer, said hardening monomer in an amount effective to provide a copolymer emulsion containing a copolymer with a Tg of less than or equal to OCO. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The aqueous copolymer emulsion of the present invention is prepared by conventional batch, semi continuous or continuous polymerization procedures. These are taught, for example inU.S. Pat. No. 2,754,280, 2,795,564, 3,732,184, and in the book entitled The Applications of SyntheticResin Emulsion by H. Warson, Ernest Benn Limited, London, 1972, pp. 85 to 132. The monomers which are copolymerized in accordance with the present invention are ethylenically unsaturated compounds, comprising a softening monomer, a hardening monomer, a latent crosslinking monomer, an active crosslinking monomer, and an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid. For the purpose of this description, the term softening monomer means a vinyl monomer, which has a Tg of less than 0 C, preferably 20 to 80or. The softening monomer when copolymerized with a hardening monomer will lower the glass transition temperature Tg of the copolymer or, in other words, soften the copolymer. The softening monomer may be a mono or diethylenically unsaturated monomer. Examples of monoethylenically unsaturated softening monomers are vinyl esters of alkanoic acids having from 3 to about 18 carbon atoms, such as vinyl propionate, vinyl butyrate, vinyl isobutyrate, vinyl valerate, vinyl 2 ethylhexanoate, vinyl isooctanoate, vinyl nonoate, vinyl decanoate, vinyl pivalate, vinyl ester e.g.VersaticAcid TM, a branched carboxylic acid, marketed by the Shell Oil Corporation , vinyl laurate, and vinylstearate also alpha olefins, such as ethylene, propylene, butylene, isobutylene, and pentene and the like also maleate, fumarate, and itaconate esters of C,.Cs alcohols, such as dibutyl maleate, dibutyl fumarate, dibutyl itaconate also alkyl acrylates with an alkyl group having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n butyl, sec butyl, the various isomeric pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, and octyl especially 2 ethylhexyl , lauryl, cetyl, stearyl and like groups also alkyl esters of methacrylic acid with an alkyl group having from 4 to about 18 carbon atoms, such as n butyl, n hexyl, 2 ethyl hexyi, n octyl, lauryl, cetyl, stearyl and like groups also vinyl alkyl ethers, having an alkyl group with 1 to 18 carbon atoms, such as methyl vinyl ether, ethyl vinyl ether, butyl vinyl ether and stearyl vinyl ether. Examples of softening monomers are diene monomers, such as butadiene, chloroprene, and isoprene and similar compounds. These softening monomers are present in the amount of 50 to 95 percent by weight of the copolymer solids in the emulsion. By the term hardening monomer is meant a monomer, which when copolymerized with a softening monomer, will raise the glass transition temperature of the copolymer, or, in other words, will harden the copolymer. The hardening monomer will have a Tg of greater than 0 C, preferably a Tg of 20 C to 115 C. Examples of hardening monomers include aromatic vinyl monomers, such as styrene, alpha methylstyrene, vinyl toluene, 2bromostyrene, and p chlorostyrene also acrylonitrile also vinyl halide monomers, such as vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride also alkyl methacrylates, such as methyl methacrylate and ethyl methacrylate also benzyl acrylate and t butyl acrylate also vinyl esters of aromatic acids, such as vinyl benzoate also vinyl esters of alkanoic acids having from 1 2 carbons, such as vinyl acetate.The amount of hardening monomer necessary to obtain the desired glass transition temperature Tg of the copolymers is calcuiated by using a method described by Fox,Bull.Am.Physics Soc., 1,3, page 123 1956 . The following equation allows the calculation of the Tg EMI2.1 where W1, W2 and W2 are the weight fractions of the comonomers M1, M2 and M2 respectively, and Tgp and Tgp2and Tg p3 are the glass transition temperatures in degrees Kelvin of the homopolymers Pl, P2, and P2 derived from monomers M1, M2 and M3 respectively, and T9iymer is the glass transition temperature of the resulting copolymer in degrees Kelvin. Tables of the glass transition temperatures of the homopolymers are readily available and include the one in PolymerHandbook 2nd edition, Wiiey, 1975 Section Ill, pp. 143 to 192 by W.A. Lee and R.A. Rutherford.Monomers may also be selected to obtain the appropriate Tg through the use of the Rohm andHaas Acrylic Glass Temperature Analyzer , publication CM 24 4 76 of Rohm and Haas Co., Philadelphia, Pa. Tg or glass transition temperature is described in the book by Flory, Principies of Polymer Chemistry , pp. 56 and 57, Cornell UniversityPress 1953 .In the copolymer emulsions of this invention, the amount of hardening monomers in the copolymer emulsion is about from 0 to 35 percent by weight of the copolymer, with the amount of hardening monomer being effective to provide a Tg of less than 000. The glass transition temperature Tg of the emulsion copolymer of the present invention is less than or equal to 000., preferably from 40 to 0 C. and optimally from 40 C to 000. By the term latent crosslinking monomer is meant a polyfunctional monomer wherein a portion of the functionality enters into the copolymerization with other monomers in the copolymer emulsion, with the residual functionality causing crosslinking of the copolymer upon the subsequent application of energy, generally by applying heat, e.g. by drying and curing of the latex particles, often in the presence of a catalyst, or by applying radiation.The latent crosslinking monomer provides thermosetting characteristics to the copolymer emulsion.Upon the subsequent application of energy the latent crosslinking monomer forms an insoluble crosslinked network, with the crosslinking being triggered generally by heat or radiation after the copolymer emulsion has been formed and applied to a fabric. This insoluble crosslinked network on the fabric thus provides a durable sizing composition.Examples of latent crosslinking monomers are N alkylolamides of alpha, beta ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids having 3 10 carbons, such as N methylol acrylamide, Methanol acrylamide,N propanol acrylamide, v N methylol mathacrylamide, N ethanol methacrylamide, Nmethylol maleimide, N methylol maleamide, Nmethylol maleamic acid, N methylol maleamic acid esters the N alkylol amides of the vinyl aromatic acids, such as N rnethylol l vinylbenzamide and the like also N alkoxymethyl acrylates and methacrylates, where the alkyl group has from 1 8 carbon atoms, such as N methoxymethyl acrylamide, N butoxymethyl acrylamide, N methoxymethyl methacrylamide, and N butoxymethyl methacrylamide.Mixtures of acrylamide, methacrylamide, or allyl carbamate with the afore mentioned latent crosslinking monomers may also be employed. Other monomers in this category are N methylol allyl carbamate, and theN alkoxymethyl ally carbamates, where the alkyl group has from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, such as N butoxymethyl allyl carbamate and N methoxymethyl allyl carbamate, and mixtures of these monomers with ally carbamate, acrylamide or methacrylamide. Epoxy containing monoethylenically unsaturated compounds, such as glycidyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate and vinyl glycidyl ether function as latent crosslinking monomers in conjunction with mono and diethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as acrylic methacrylic and itaconic acid, when catalyzed with an alkaline catalyst, such as potassium or sodium carbonate, diethylenetriamine and the like.Hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate and the corresponding methacrylates provide latent crosslinking when combined with N alkylolamides of aipha, beta ethylenically unsaturated acids having 3 10 carbon atoms or with the acids themselves by ester formation Another group of latent crosslinking monomers is described in U.S. Patents No. 3,678,098 and 4,009,314. These are cationic chlorohydrin compounds having the following formula EMI3.1 where R methyl or H A alkylene X,Y halogen The crosslinking reation of these monomers is also catalized by the alkaline compounds mentioned above. The amount of latent crosslinking monomer in the copolymer of the present invention is about from 0.5 to 10 percent, preferably from about 2 to 6 percent by weight of the copolymer. By the term active crosslinking monomer is meant a functional monomer which immediately provides crosslinking and branching of the polymer during the initial formation of the emulsion copolymer to increase the molecular weight of the emulsion copolymer. Subsequent drying or other curing techniques are not required for the crosslinking and branching of the emulsion copolymer by the active crosslinking monomer. Monomers of this type generally comprise compounds which contain 2 to 5 ethylenically unsaturated groups in one molecule separated by an ester or ether group, or by an aromatic or nitrogenous ring structure, where the unsaturated groups are capable of undergoing addition polymerization by free radical means.Suitable active crosslinking monomers include alkylene glycol diacrylates and methacrylates, such as ethylene glycol diacrylate, 1 3 butylene glycol diacrylate, propylkene glycol diacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate etc., 1,3 glycerol dimethacrylate, 1,1 ,1 trimethylol propane dimethacrylate, 1,1,1 , trimethylol ethane diacrylate, pentaerythritol trimethacrylate, sorbitol pentamethacrylate, methylene bisacrylamide, methylene bismethacrylamide, divinyl benzene, vinyl methacrylate, vinyl crotonate, vinyl acrylate, divinyl adipate also di and tri allyl compounds, such as triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, diallyl phthalate, allyl methacrylate, allyl acrylate, diai lyl maleate, diallyl fumarate, diallyl itaconate, diallyl malonate, diallyl carbonate, triallyl citrate, triallyl aconitate also divinyl ether, ethylene glycol divinyl ether and the like. The amount of active crosslinking monomer in the copolymer emulsion of the present invention is from about 0.01 to 0.5 percent, preferably from about 0.05 to 0.25 percent by weight of the copolymer. An ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid is added to the emulsion copolymer to provide running properties, i.e. so the emulsion can be applied to the yarn without sticking. The unsaturated carboxylic acid prevents premature crosslinking of the emulsion copolymer during the application of the sizing compositi.on on the slashes, preventing the buildup of polymers on the padrolls during slashing. Generally, any ethylenically unsaturated monoor dicarboxylic acid may be used to provide the carboxyl functionality to the copolymer.Examples of suitable acids include the monocarboxylic ethylenically unsaturated acids such as acrylic, crotonic, and methacrylic acid the dicarboxylic ethylenically unsaturated acids such as maleic, fumaric, itaconic, and citraconic acid, as well as the half esters of these dicarboxylic acids with C, C,2 alcohols. Examples of these monomeric acids are monomethylmaleate, monoethylmaleate, monobutylmaleate, and mono 2 ethylhexyl maleate and the like. The amount of unsaturated acids present in the emulsion copolymer of the present invention are about 0.5 to 5 percent, preferably 1 to 2.5 percent, by weight of the copolymer. The amount is sufficient to provide redispersing properties, but insufficient to make the emulsion copolymer al kaiine soluble. The polymer emulsion of the present invention is prepared in the presence of suitable anionic, cationic or nonionic emulsifiers or mixtures thereof.Optionally, protective colloids, illustrated by polyvinyl alcohol and hydroxyethyl cellulose, may also be present. Suitable nonionic emulsifying agents include alkylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols having alkyl groups of about 7 to 18 carbon atoms and 10 to 60 or more oxyethylene units, such as octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols, methyloctylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols, nonylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols, dodecylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols also ethylene oxide derivatives of long chained carboxylic acids, such as lauric, myristic, palmitic, oleic, and stearic acid, containing 10 to 60 oxyethylene units per molecule also analogous ethylene oxide condensates of long chained alcohols, such as octyl, decyl, lauryl, stearyl and cetyl alcohols, ethylene oxide derivatives of etherified or esterified polyhydroxy compounds having a hydrophobic component, such as lauric, myristic, palmitic, oleic, and stearic acid, containing 10 to 60 oxyethylene units per molecule also analogous ethylene oxide condensates of long chained alcohols, such as octyl, decyl, lauryl, stearyl, and cetyl alcohols, ethylene oxide derivatives of etherified or esterified polyhydroxy compounds having a hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain, such as sorbitan monostearate containing 10 to 60 oxyethylene units also block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide comprising a hydrophobic propylene oxide section combined with one or more hydrophilic ethylene oxide sections.Suitable anionic emulsifying agents include higher fatty alcohol sulfates, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the alkylaryl sulfonates, such as the sodium salt of t octylphenyl sulfonate, the sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinates, disodium fatty alkyl alkanolamide sulfosuccinate, and the ammonium salt of a sulfate or phosphate ester of an alkylphenoxy poly ethyleneoxy ethanol, where the oxyethyiene content is from 3 to 30 moles per alkylphenol. Suitable cationic emulsifiers include Ndodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, and N vinyl benzyl trimethyl ammonium chloride and the like. Generally, the copolymer emulsions of this invention contain from 3 to 10 percent, preferably from 4.5 to 6 percent, emulsifiers based on the weight of the monomers solids . It is preferred that a polymerization process is used in making the copolymer emulsions of the invention. A aqueous phase is prepared first containing water, a small portion of a nonionic emulsifier, sometimes also a mixture of anionic and nonionic emulsifiers, and a very small amount of ferrous sulfate, being a redox component in the finishing catalyst system for the copolymer emulsion.The aqueous phase is purged well with nitrogen, and heated to 60 to 70 C. A small portion of monomer, often a mixture of two monomers, is then added followed by a suitable amount of initial catalyst, most often from about 1 to 3 percent based on the weight of the initial monomer charge.Often it is advantageous to use potassium persulfate as tha catalyst because the resulting copolymer has better resistance to heat discolor afion. But sodium or ammonium persulfates can also be used. After the emulsion polymerization has initiated, the rest of the monomers are gradually added to the reaction mixture, often emulsified in water together with the latent crosslinking monomers and the active crosslinking monomers Generally, the gradual addition of the monomers is carried out over a time period of two and a half to five hours. More catalyst solution is also added gradually to maintain the polymerization reaction at a temperature from 70 to 80 C. Oftem cooling is applied to the reaction vessel by means of a waterbath to remove the excess heat of polymerization.Usually, a total of 02 to 1 percent of catalyst based on the weight of the monomers, is added over the course of the emulsion polymerization. After ail the monomer has been added, a small amount of an organic peroxide, such as t butyl hydroperoxide and cumene hydroperoxide, and the like are added for the finishing step, together with a small amount of a reducing agent, such as sodium metabisulfate, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate and zinc formaldehyde sulfoxylate In place of an organic peroxide, hydrogen peroxide or persulfates, such as potassium, sodium or ammonium persulfates may also be used. The terminal catalyst necessary to finish the reaction is generally about 10 to 30 percent by weight of the total amount of catalyst consumed during the reaction.The reducing agent is ordinarily added in the necessary equivalent amount Normally no buffering agent is required to keep the pH between 3 and 5. If necessary, dilute ammonia may be added from time to time to adjust the pH within those limits. Others auxiliary agents may be added to the finished copolymer emulsion, such as defoamers, biocides and the like. The emulsion copolymers of the present invention have a solids content from 35 to 55 percent, preferably from 40 to 50 percent. The viscosity of the copolymer emulsion of the present invention is generally low. It is preferred that the viscosity not be more than 150 cps as measured with a Brookfield viscometer at 50 RPM. The molecular weight of the copolymer of the present invention is very high. Because the presence of the active crosslinking monomer during the copolymerization resuits in slight crosslinking and much branching of the macromolecules, it is very difficult to accurately measure the molecular weight It is, however, desirable to measure the intrinsic viscosity of the copolymer, which is an indirect measure of molecular weight, for comparative purposes.The intrinsic viscosity is determined by conventional techniques, i.e. in accordance with the procedure described on pages 309 314 of the book Principles of polymerChemistry by Paul Flory Cornell University Press, 1953 . The copolymer emulsions of the present invention may be used in this form as a durable sizing composition, but it is preferred that certain reactants and size bath additives first be blended with with the copolymer emulsion. For example, to prevent premature crosslinking and to facilitate ap plication in the pad bath, ammonium hydroxide or another suitable alkaline material is preferably added to the emulsion to adjust the pH of the composition from its intial acid condition to a pH of about 5 to 10, preferably about 6.5 to 7. Additionally, it is preferable to also include in the aqueous sizing composition a small amount, i.e. from about 1 to 3 percent by weight, of a hydroxyl containing water soluble polymer, such as polyvinyl alcohol, hydroxyethyl cellulose, or starch.To enhance the durability of the water soluble hydroxy containing polymer on the yam, a small amount, i.e. 0.1 to 3 percent by weight of a reactive resin may optionally be included in the durable sizing composition. Suitable reactive resins include aminoplasts, such as melamine formaldehyde resins, glyoxal resins, urea formaldehyde resins and the like also monmeric and polymeric epoxy resins, dialdehydes, ethyleneureaglyoxal codensates, and aziridines may be employed to increase the durability of the water soluble hydroxy polymers.Catalysts for enhancing the reactivity of both the latent crosslinking monomers. contained in the copolymer, and the aminoplasts and the like, also may optionally be added to the sizing composition.Metal salts, such as magnesium chloride, aluminum chioride, zinc nitrate and the like, are suitable for this purpose, as are ammonium salts of strong acids, such as ammonium chloride, nitrate or sulfate. Especially useful as catalysts for the aminoplasts are sulfonic acids, such as paratoluene sulfonic acid and methane sulfonic acid. The catalyst may be suitably used at a concentration ranging from 0.01 to 10 percent, preferably 0.1 to 3 pearcent based on the weight of the sizing composition. Slasher bath additives such as lubricants, defoamers, antistats and the like are also often used. Sizing formulations, containing these additives are well known in th art. The copolymer emulsions of the present invention may be applied to the yarn using conventional equipemnt, such as a textile slasher. Textile warp sizing is a well known art. Sizing formulations and the equipment, such as a slasher, are described, for example, in detail in the book The Technology of Warp Sizing , Columbine Press, Manchester, England 1964 . It is particularly important that the runability of the size composition be good. The liquid sizing composition is applied to the yarn by means of a padder. Often, the sizing composition will dry partially on the padroll and causse a buildup of polymer on teh roll. This is very undesirable because the partially dried polymer will stick to the yarn and cause difficulties later during the weaving process.However, the copolymer emulsion of the present invention run particularly well on the slasher, because they still redisperse easily, and, therefore, cause no polymer buiid up on the padroll. It was found that a minimum amount of a mono or dicarboxylic acid, such as 0.5 5 percent, preferably 1 2.5 percent, is necessary in the copolymer emulsion based on the weight of the other monomers, to prevent padroll build up. In the following examples, illustrative of the present invention, the parts and percentages are by weight and the temperaturees are in Celsius degrees.

A piece of unsized polyester cotton cloth was treated with this solution and then dried at 121 0C for 60 seconds and cured at 205 C for 30 seconds. The fabric was weighed before and after the treatment.The treated fabric was then desized with water for 1 minute at 630C, scoured for 1 minute at 82 C with a 3 caustic solution, held in a laboratory J box for 1 hour at 930C, washed for 1 minute in 62 C water and then bleached with a solution of 1.5 sodium silicate 1 caustic 0.1 octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol containing 10 moles of oxyethylene per mole of octylphenol Triton X100 supplied by the Rohm and Haas Company 3 hydrogen peroxide 50 active and water to 100 , for 1 minute at 32 C. After this the fabric was again kept for 1 hour in a J box at 93 C, washed for 1 minute at 63 C, and dried. The fabric weights were compared before and after this treatment and the retention calculated. The retention was 82 percent. Because of the Tg below 0 C of the polymer, the fabric was soft and did not have a harsh feel as is common with sizing compositions containing polymers with a Tg of greater than 0 C. Examples 17 24 The copolymer emulsions of Examples 4 15 were evaluated for retention according to Example 16. The results are tabulated in the last column ofTable 2. It can be seen that in each case the retention was excellent.
