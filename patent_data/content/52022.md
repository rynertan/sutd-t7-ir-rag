# Calibrator for a service magnetic azimuth detector of an aircraft and method employing a test detector.

## Abstract
Calibrator for calibrating a service magnetic azimuth detector 18 of a craft the service detector 18 is respon sive to the magnetic field of the earth to provide a service heading signal said calibrator includes a test magnetic azimuth detector 10 for providing a test signal signifying the magnetic orientation of the test detector 10 with res pect to the prevailing magnetic field of the earth a turntable 12 is provided for rotatably supporting the test detector 10 also provided is a calibration computer 34 connected to the test detector 10 and responsive to the test heading signal the calibration computer 34 is operable to deter mine the variations in the test heading signal due to changes in the magnetic field of the earth and the calibra tion computer 34 is operable to connect to the service detector 18 and determine the difference in the service heading signal when the craft is adjacent to and removed from the service detector 18 .
