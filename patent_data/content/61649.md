# Protective relay.

## Abstract
The invention provides percent unbalance or ratio ground relay 10 which detects open phase conductors on electrical distribution circuits, as well as single phase to ground faults regardless of fault impedance, by providing an operating quantity K₁N₁² 3I₀ ² responsive to zero sequence current, and a restraining quantity K₂N₂² I² K₂N₃² 3I₀ ² responsive to a pre fault balance phase current minus the zero sequence current. This restraint torque arrangement causes the relay to operate on true ratio unbalance, regard less of load.
