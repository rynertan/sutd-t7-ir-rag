# Improvements relating to the production of coloured expandable polystyrene.

## Abstract
A process for dyeing expandable polystyrene beads involves making an aqueous slurry, adding the dye and heat ing in a closed pressure vessel. The only additive required is a surfactant which wets the surface of the beads to reduce surface tension and allow the dye to penetrate homogene ously through the beads.

## Description
Improvements relating to the production of coloured expandable polystyrene This invention relates to the production of coloured expandable polystyrene E.P.S . An early proposal for dyeing pre expanded polystyrene beads is described in US Patent o. 3020247, but this had shortcomings. The process was difficult to control and resulted in surface dyeing only1 whereas the aim was, and is in this invention, to attain uniform colouring. throughout. Failure to achieve this results in a mottled appearance in the final moulding of expanded beads. The problem appeared to be mainly one of time and temperature.The beads expand at more than 900C and if immersed in an open bath for more than 30minutes they lose too much blowing agent. Thus the beads could not be heated for long nor at very high temperatures, and so the dye could not penetrate sufficiently, even with the recommended solvents. This process was soon superseded by one in which the dye vessel was closed and the dye was aided by a penetrant, as described in British Patent No. 1064490. The dyeing was thus carried out under pressure, and higher temperatures and longer times could be used. A preferred penetrant was pentane, which is the commonest blowing anent for E.P.S. beads. This was an improvement, but a further advance was claimed in British Patent No. 1314701, which proposed the use of a dye adjuvant rather than a bead penetrant. The dye adjuvant contained organic compounds which, it was believed, broke down the surface layer of the beads, swelling and softening the skin that impedes dye penetration. Neither of these methods are perfect. With the first one it has been found that the penetrant does not necessarily result in homogeneous colouring, and a fault with the favoured pentane penetrant is that the contents of the vessel tend to gel together, irrespective of agitation or stirring. With the second method, it is clearly undesirable to attack the structure of the beads. The aim of this invention is therefore to dye E,P,S, beads without the use of any additive to the aqueous slurry that will cause gelling or modification to the structure of the beads. The result should be dye and nothing but dye permeated right through all the still unexpanded beads. According to the present invention there is provic d i process for producing coloured expandable polystyrene, wherein expandable non coloured polystyrene beads are charged to a pressure vessel with water and oil soluble and or spirit soluble dye, the resultant slurry is heated to at least 500C and subject to at least autogenous pressure in the closed vessel, and subseouently cooled, and the polystyrene beads, dyed and ready for expansion, are separated from the remaining contents of the vessel, characterised in that the sole initial active additive to the slurry, apart from the dye and optionally a diluent for the additive, is a surface active agent or surfactant incapable of penetrating or modifying the structure of the beads, but which acts to lower the surfacetension at, or whet , the surface of the beads to ease dye penetration. By active additive is meant a substance that positively assists dye to penetrate the beads. It would of course be possible, although unnecessary, to add harFJless passive ingredients which contributed nothing to the dye penetration. It has been found that advantageously the surfactant should be non ionic or a substantially balanced mixture of anionic and cationic surfactants so as to have an HLB hydrophilic lypophilic balance value of 8 12 and preferably 11. Very little is required. by weight of the total mix is a more than adequate maximum and usually it will be considerably less than thisExcessive amounts are not harmful, but can give rise to foaming, which could be cured by an anti foaming arena. Dispersion of the surfactant through the mix can be aided by diluting it with an organic liquid, for example methyl alcohol in the form of methylated spirits. An example of a suitable surfactant is the substance sold under the trade name P2SEX 20, which is a blend of polyoxyethylene esters of mixed fatty acids.Another such substance is that sold under the trade name TE 20. In one preferred form of the process, the beads are charged with the water and dye to a pressure vessel, which is left unpressurised during initial heating to a temperature less than that at which the beads will expand.The vessel is then closed for heating to higher temperatures up to 900C, Higher temperatures than that, even under pressure, tend to make the beads expand. A convenient closure temperature is 500C, but it could be anywhere in the range 4000 800C. The maximum temperature attained and the length of dwell at that temperature depend on the dye and the depth of colour required. The dwell may be negligible or for several hours. The autogenous pressures attained depend on the time of closure and temperatures.They may be in the range 30 45 psig 206843 310264 Pa , but will usually be 35 40 psig 241316 275790 Pa .Throughout the process the slurry will be stirred or agitated. For safety reasons, the slurry may be blanketed with an inert eas such as nitrogen, particularly during the unpressurised heat up period and the cooling down period. A further 10 15 psig 68948 103421 Pa may be added to the autogenous pressure when the vessel is closed this has a steadvinz effect on the vortex. The dye is preferably of the monoazo, disazo or anthraquinone type. For a better understanding of the invention some examples of the process will now be described in more detail. EXAl2PLE 1 The following were charged to a nominally 250gallon 1137 litre or total 350 gallon 1591 litre pressure vessel capable of sustaining a safe working pressure of up to 90 psig 620528 Pa at operating temperatures of up to 1300C 1. 140 gallons 636 litres of untreated mains water 2. 625Kg polstyrene beads containing a pneumatogen, i.e. a blowing agent which eventually causes their expansion 3 A slurry of 600g WAXOLINE YELLOW T dyestuff and 60 E sGERES ORANGE G dyestuff in about 1 gallon 4.5 litres untreated water containing abou 200ml of RENEX 20 as a wetting agent. The contents were heated while being stirred to 50 C in the pressure vessel, which was relieved to atmosphere whilst a safety blanket of inert gas ultra pure nitrogen at about 3 4 psi 20684 27579 Pa was maintained over those contents by a steady flow from a standard gas cylinder. The vent valve was closed at 5000 and the heating continued until the contents of the vessel reached a temperature of 800C, The contents of the vessel were maintained at this temperature for a period of 2 hours and then cooled, using a surrounding water jacket, to about 4000. Total time for heat up coo l down was about 1 hours, making it a 4 hour process. The contents of the vessel were then discharged, and the liquid was drained from the beads. hen dried and expanded the beads were uniformly medium shaded yellow orange and the article moulded from them likewise.

A slurry of 1Kg WA OLINE BLUE AP dyestuff 5 in about 1 gallon 4.5 litres untreated water containing about 200ml of TWEEN 20 as a wetting agent. After the vent valve was closed at 50 C, the heating continued until the contents of the vessel reached a temperature of 90 C. The contents of the vessel were maintained at this temperature for a period of 3 hours and then cooled, using the surrounding water jacket, to about 40 C. Total time for heat up cool down was about 2 hours, making it a 5 hour process. When dried and expanded the beads were uniformly medium shaded blue and the article moulded from them likewise.
