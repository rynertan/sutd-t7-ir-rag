# Apparatus for transmitting optical image.

## Abstract
In an apparatus for transmitting an optical image using an image guide 35 which is equipped with dispersive devices 33, 37 , the invention has an advantage such that it uses, as a component, an image guide 35 in which an arrangement of optical fibers 35a,... is irregular, namely, an arrangement of optical fibers in a cross section perpendicu lar to their longitudinal direction does not have a constant periodic pattern in any directions in the cross section, or that dispersive devices 33, 37 which are arranged in an objective lens system 32, 33, 34 and an ocular lens system 36, 37, 38 are attached by being rotated by only a constant angle in the same direction around their respective optical axes as rotational centers with respect to each of an edge surface and rear edge surface of the image guide.
