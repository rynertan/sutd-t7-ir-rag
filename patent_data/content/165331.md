# Buckling beam test probe assembly.

## Abstract
The buckling beam probe container assembly comprises a number of square test probe arrays each containing a plurality of buckling beams 50 in the form of continuous wires extending from the probe tips to a remote test apparatus. The buckling beams pass through an adjustable beam carrier block 48 and through a number of guide plates 56, 57, 58 which are kept in predetermined distances along the buckling beams by means of thin stabilizing rods 60 arranged at the corners of the test probe array 50 . The guide plates are inserted into grid like frames, 90,92 which allow the arrangement of a plurality of test probe arrays close to each other wherein each array may contain test probes over its full area except for the locations occupied by the thin stabilizing rods.
