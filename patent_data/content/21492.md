# Disposable diaper type garment having wetness indicator.

## Abstract
An improved absorbent product, such as a disposable diaper type garment 20 having a wetness indicator disposed between a translucent cover member 21 and an absorbent member. The improvement relates to providing a flexible pH change color change wetness indicator coating 26 on a surface portion of the product which is visible through the cover member, and which retains sharp edge definition of the coated surface portion when wetted for instance, by urine. The coating is preferably applied in the form of a stripe to a portion of the inwardly facing surface of a backsheet of a disposable diaper. Such a coating comprises a solid solid mixture eg., solution of a pH change color change type material dispersed in a matrix of adhesive material which coating is sufficiently flexible to not substantially impair the flexibility of the product, and which coating is sufficiently adhesive and flexible to remain on the coated surface portion through a normal period of use of the product.
