# Heat curable silicone compositions, use thereof and stabilizer therefor.

## Abstract
Organosilicon compositions which cure by way of a metal catalyzed reaction of silicon bonded hydroxyl radicals and or silicon bonded olefinic hydrocarbon radicals with silicon bonded hydrogen atoms are stabilized for hours at room temperature by the incorporation of a hydrocarbon oxy alkyl maleate. However, the stablized compositions are rapidly curable at low elevated temperature. Liquid organo polysiloxane compositions of this invention are particularly useful for coating operations, particularly paper coating operations to prepare an adhesive releasing layer.
