## Description
The present invention relates to an instantaneously heated coffee machine, including one or more coffee dispensing assemblies or units, and a coffee mill with u built in metering device, having matable shapes to be mutually coupled. As it is known, there are presently made coffee machines, of the instantaneous heated type, provided with a single dispensing assembly, which are used, in addition to home enviromments, in offices, communities and the like. Obviously the mentioned instantaneously heated coffee machines are able of meeting limited needs, thereby, as the coffee demand increases, they are to be replaced by other coffee machine, usually of the steam accumulating type, and provided with a greater number of coffee dispensing assemblies, and consequently of high cost. With those same machines, moreover,.there is usually associated a coffee mill which conventionally forms an independent device, having an inverted frustum of cone structure arranged on a suitable supporting upright. That coffee mill, as it should be apparent, because of its specifically designed struc ture, is not effective to neatly combine with the design of the coffee machine and, accordingly, is held as a separate unit from the latter. Accordingly, the task of the present invention is to provide an istantaneously heated coffee machine, of very reduced cost, and a coffee mill including a coffee powder metering device, which may be neatly fitted to one another, in such a way as to provide a substantially integral structure. According to one aspect of the present invention, the above task, as well as yet other objects which will become more apparent thereinafter, are achieved by an instantaneously heated coffee machine and coffee mill including a coffee metering device, characterized in that they are made with matable shapes, in such a way to be effective to be coupled to substantially provide an integral or single body. In particular, the instantaneous heated coffee machine may comprise one or more coffee dispensing assemblies or units. Further characteristics and advantages of the instantaneously heated coffee machine and coffee mill according to the present invention, will become more apparent thereinafter from the following detailed description and with reference to the accompanying drawings, where Fig. 1 is a perspective view illustrating the coffee mill including a coffee powder metering device according to the invention Fig. 2 illustrates the coffee machine, including a single coffee dispensing assembly or unit, and which may comprise a coffee waste holding small drawer Fig. 3 is an exploded view illustrating the coffee machine according to Fig. 1 Fig. 4 illustrates a coffee machine comprising two coffee dispensing assemblies or units and a coffe waste holding drawer Fig. 5 illustrates a coffee machine comprising three coffee dispensing assemblies or units and Figs. 6, 7 and 8 schematically illustrate, from the top, some possible practical arrangement of the mentioned coffee machines and coffee mill. With reference to the several Figures of the accompanying drawings, the coffee mill 1 and the instantaneously heated coffee machine 2, according to the invention, are arranged in substantially round or elongated cross section casings, provided with convex side walls 3, and a concave side wall 4 effective to be neatly mated with one of the mentioned convex walls. That approach affords the possibility of coupling an instantaneously heated coffee machine to a coffee mill, while providing a compact structure susceptible to be easily modified as the needs change. More specifically, the instantaneous heated coffee machine may be provided with one pr more coffee dispensing assemblies or units 5, including the related steam duct 6, as arranged at the bottom of a cantilever substantially round body l, provided with suitable driving and control members. It should be noted that each coffee dispensing assembly of the coffee machine has a specific structure and operates in an independent way from the other coffee dispensing assemblies.In fact, for each coffee dispensing assembly or unit, the coffee machine is provided with a vibration type of pump 20 including a sucking duct 21 communicating with a water tank 22. The pump 20 is coupled, through a delivery duct 23, to a heating chamber 24, which comprises a metering valve 25 effective to adjust the inlet of the heated water to the coffee powder, contained in the inter exchangeable cup member 26 housed in the filter holder 21. The coffee mill, in turn, has its operating members also enclosed in a cantilever round cross section body 8, thereunder there is provided a fork shaped member 9 effective to support the filter of the two coffee dispensing as semblies, during the fill in of the ground coffee powder. The mentioned coffee mill is also provided with a lever 10 for controlling a coffee powder metering device. The coffee machine according to the invention is also provided with a coffee powder waste drawer member 9 as arranged at the bottom 11 of the coffee machine according to the invention. From the above disclosure it should be noted that the invention fully achieves the intended task, and in particular it should be pointed out that the provision of a coffee machine including a number of coffee dispensing assemblies or units, each whereof is provided with an individual water tank, an individual water supplying pump and an independent heating assembly, affords the possibility of obtaining a coffee machine with a high output, while providing a comparatively constructionally simple coffee machine. 1reover, the specific used structure affords the possibility of rationalize the size, thereby affording the possibility of easily adjoining a coffee mill. The invention as disclosed is susceptible to several modifications and variations, all of which comes within the scope of the invention. In practicing the invention all of the details may be replaced by other technically equivalent elements.
