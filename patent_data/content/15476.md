# A method of oxidizing organic compounds in an aqueous system and a catalyst therefor.

## Abstract
A method of oxidizing organic compounds, such as 1,3,5 trichlorobenzene, in an aqueous system of pH not more than about 4, by contacting the compound with an oxidizing agent, such as air, in the presence of a catalyst, said catalyst comprising a combination of a nitrate ions, b at least one of either bromide ions or iodide ions, and c transition metal ions of at least one transition metal having two or more oxidation states, such as vanadium ions. This catalyst enhances the rate of oxidation of the organic compounds.
