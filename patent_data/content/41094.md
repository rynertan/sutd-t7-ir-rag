# Particle withdrawal from fluidized bed systems.

## Abstract
A fiuidized bed combustion apparatus from which ash formed within, and accumulated at the lower portion of, the fluidized bed coal gasification reactor vessel 10 is removed. A supplemental fluidizing gas, at a temperature substantially less than the average fluidized bed combustion operating temperature, is injected into the vessel and flows upwardly through the ash so as to form a discrete thermal interface region 28 between the fluidized bed 12 and the ash 24 . The elevation of the interface region 28 , which rises with ash accumulation, is monitored by a thermocouple 30 and inter related with a motor controlled outlet valve 34 . When the interface 28 rises above the temperature indicator 30 , the valve 34 opens to allow removal of some of the ash, and the valve 34 is closed, or positioned at a minimum setting, when the interface 28 drops to an elevation below that of the thermocouple 30 .
