DESCRIPTION Background Art It is known to electrolyze aqueous alkali metal chloride or lnke halide in a membrane cell having an ion exchange normally cation exchange membrane which separates anode from cathode. Since the membrane itself is generally impermeable or substantially so to gas and liquid flow, the electrolysis generates chlorine at the anode and alkali at the cathode, the alkali being of high purity and contain ing only very low chloride concentration One type of cell which has been proposed for such electrolysis is the solid polymer electrolyte cell. solid polymer electrolyte cell is characterized by an ion exchange membrane, which seDarates electrode of the cell and by the fact that one or prefErably both electrodes are in contact with the membrane. The solid polymer electrolyte cells present with respect to conventional membrane tells in which the cathode and frequently both anode and cathode are separated from the membrane , several advantages useful in different electrolysis processes. More precisely 1 The overall voltage between electrodes is lower because the interelectrodic distance is reduced practically to the membrane thickness. 2 The so called bubble effect is eliminated or at least minimized, i.e. the difficul.y normally encountered in electrolytic processes where gas is evolved at the electrode accumulates in the zone between electrodes is avoided because evolved gas can be released behind the electrodes to the inside of the cell compartment. 3 The cell may be very compact and thus the ohmic drops at the current distribution structures can be reduced. The ion permeable diaphragms are cation exchange polymers in the form of thin flexible sheets or membranes. Generally they are imperforate and do not permit a flow of anolyte into the cathode chamber but it has also been suggested that such membranes may be provided with some small perforations to permit a small flow of anolyte therethrough, although the bulk of the work appears to have been accomplished with i perforate nembranes. Typical polymers which may be used for this purpose include fluorocarbon polymers such as polymers of trifluoroethylene or tetrafluoroethyiene cr copolymers thereof which contain ion exchange groups are used for this purpose. The ion exchange groups norznally are cationic groups include sulfonic acid, sulfDnagide, carboxylic acid, phosphoric acid a119 the like, which are artached to the fluorocarbon poly gte chain through carbon and which exchange cations. However, they may also contain anion exchange groups. l yp caL such membranes have the general formula EMI3.1 Such membranes include typically those fluorocarbon ion exchange polymers manufactured by the Du Pont Company under the trade nae of Nafion and by Asahi Glass Company of Japan under the trade na e of Flemion . Patents which describe such membranes include British Patent No. 1,184,321 and U.S. Patent No.3,282,875 and U.S. No. 4,075,405. Since these diaphragms are ion permeable but do not permit anolyte flow therethrough, little or no halide ion migrates through the diaphragm or such a material in an alkali chloride cell and therefore the alkali thus produced contains little or no chloride ion. Furthermore, it is possible to produce a more concentrated alkali metal hydroxide in which the catholyte produced may contain from 5 to 45 NaOH by weight. or over higher. Patents which describe such a process include U.S.Patents No. 4,111,779 and No. 14,100,050 and many others.The application of an ion exchange membrane as an ion permeable diaphragm has been proposed for other uses such as in water elec .rolysis . in cells of the type contemplated, the cathode is in dlose proximity to or in direct contact with the ion exchange membrane. They must be sufficiently permeable to permit rapid escape of evolved gas from the points of their evolution and to provide ready access of liquid electrolyte to these points as well as rapid removal of evolved alkali or other electrclysis produced from such points. Thus the electrodes are normally quite porous. One difficulty which Tha been enscu e with permeable cathodes which are in direct contact With or bonded to the membrane is that cathodic efficiency is relatively ioS for example 85 or below and that oxygen in appreciable concentraz ion, for example above 0.5 to 1 or more by volume is evolved in the chlorine produced. Apparently some portion of the alkali metal hydroxyl evolved at the cathode tends to migrate through the membrane. This may be due to the fact that caustic soda produced at the interface is not sufficiently and uniformly diluted by the catholyte within the cathode compartment of the cell. The high alkalinity may induce dehydration of the membrane with consequent decrease of the electrical conductivity, more over the high concentration gradient increases the back diffus ion of the hydroxyl ions towards the anode with a resulting loss of the faraday efficiency. . The creation of varving gradients of alkalinity on or in tie in te membrane may cause membrane shrinking and membrane swelling in localized areas and continual changing of these events and this may result in detachment and or loss of cathode layer or cathoidc material. Whatever the actual mechanism, the adverse results referred to above accrue. Best and Various Modes of Carrving out the Invention According to this invention halogen is effectively generated by electrolyzing an aqueous halide in an electro lytic cell having a pair of opposed electrodes separated by an ion permeable separator, preferably an ion exchange polyiaer and where at least one electrode, preferably the cathode, has two layers. The first layer is resistant to chemical and electrochemical attack and has a low overvoltage being readily capable of functioning as an electrode and evolving electrolysis product by electrolysis.The second such layer has a higher overvoltage hydrogen overvolt2ge in the case of the cathode surface or chlorine overvoltage ln the case of anode surface and is between the lower overvoltage surface and the membrane, generally being in direct contact with the membrane. Of course both surfaces are electroconductive and are capable of being polarized as an electrode. Furthermore both surfaces are in direct electrical contact so that there is little or substantially no potential difference between them. Since the first or rear most cathode section has a lower hydrogen overvoltage surface than that of the front section engaging the membrane a major portion and even substantially all of the cathodic electrolysis occurs at points spaced by the spacer or barrier from the membrane as distinguished from on or close to the membrane surface. The cathode where the major electrolysis takes place is readily porous and permits ready flow including lateral flowf catholyte therethrough. Thus it may be in the form of fine mesh flexible electroconductive metal screeen having 3 to 10 thresh openings per centimenter or a mat of undulating wire screen or a combination of these elements.The openings are relatively large and thus provide channels adjacent to the points of contact between the conductive second layer or spacer and the main catalytic catode section whereby catholyte may flowedgewise along the catalytic cathode surface and adjacent these points thereby sweeping away evolved alkali from the front portion of the cathode, as well as from the greats remote from the membrane. For example, the more active cathode layer may have a surface comprising a platinum group metal or oxide thereof which has a very low hydrogen overvoltage. In that case the intermediate spacer of layer can have an electroconductive surface of a netal or of an oxide which is higher in overvoltage.A porous silver or stainless steel or nickel screen nay be used for this purpose. As will be understoodother conductive materials which are resitant to corrosion in the alkaline cathode area may also be used. she intermediate secticn in any case is porous .3nd permeable to electrclyte. Being quite electroconductives it may cc operate in transmitting current to the more remote all cathode areas without serious increase in overall voltage. According to .e preferred embodiment of the prevent invention, the intermediate or spacer layer of the multi layered cathode comprises an electroconductive resiliently compressible wire mat which has a surface of higher hydrogen overvoltage than the surface of the main or catalytic cathode layer. The resiliently compressible wire mat forming the inter mediate or spacer layer of the cathode is advantageously compressed, upon assembly of the cell, between the membrane and the active or catalytic layer of the cathode. Therefore the intermediate resilient layer eserts an elastic reaction force against the membrane and the active layer during operation and effectively maintains spaced the surface of the membrane and that of the active cathode.Thus the resilient ly compressed wire rat forming the intermediate cr spacer layer besides acting to maintain z certaln.separation between te main active layer of the electrode and the surface of the merrane, also rovides for restraining the flexible membrare from fluttering under the action of the gas bubbles induced turbolence of both the anolyte and the catholyte or from bending towards the anode or the cathode under the action of varying hydraulic heads differentials.This is of great importance since it has been found that membranes l shich were assembled in cells without resilient or other means capable to maintain then firmly in place are often subjected to chafing by the continuous rubbing of the membrane against the foratnino mezal electrodes. The rigid mechanical restraints of the compressed mat 2re provided on one side by the substantially rigid foraminous anode against which the flexible membrane bears and on the other side by 3 substantially rigid foraminous pressure plate which may itself be the active catalytic layer of the cathode or it may be the current distributor against which the foraminous catalytic layer of the cathode bears. In the latter case the resiliently compressed mat This two functions one is to provide and secure a certain separat ion, preferably from 1 to 4 mm, between the surface of the membrane and the, surface of the active cathode layer during operation of the cell, the other is to press the active cathode layer against the rigid current distributing means for a satisfactory operation of the cathode. Considering that the active cathode layer most advantageous ly is made of a catholyte resistant metal such as iron, stainless steel, nickel, copper or alloys thereof, coated with a catalytic material having alow hydrogen overvoltage, such as a noble metal Pt, Rh, Ru, Ir, Pd or alloy thereof or a conductive oxide thereof or of other metals and that these coatings, which impart low hydrogen overvoltage characteristic to the main cathode layer, are seldom permanent but need to be renewed after a certain period of operation, it is evident that a great advantage derives from the possibility, offered .by this preferred embodiment of the invention, to substitute the worn out active cathode layer without having to disconnect or to cut welds and to weld or connect back in place the newly coated cathode. In fact, in the cell of the present invention, the active cathode layer may be a thin foraminous coated metal screen which is simply sandwiched between the resiliently compressed spacer layer or mat and a substantially rigid pressure plate or a series of spaced ribs or stubs, acting as the current distribution means to the active cathode layer. The resiliently compressible mat, forming the spacer layer of relatively high hydrogen overvoltage, is pliable and springlike in character and while capable of being com ressisle to a reduction of sup to GO percent or more of its ur. s.yreP thickness against the membrane by application of pressure from the compression means, it is also capable of sprinelng back substantially to its initial thickness upon release of the clamping pressure.Thus, by its elastic reaction memory, it applies and maintains substantially uniform pressure against the membrane since it is capable of distributing pressure stress and of compensating for irregularities in the surfaces with which it is in contact. It is flexible enough to bend in all directions and to assume the contours of the membrane.The compressible mat should also provide ready circulationOf the electrolyte to and from the membrane surface. Thus, the compressible layer is open in structure and includes a large free volume. The resiliently compressible mat is essentially electrically conductive on its surface, generally being made of a metal resistant to the electro chemical attack of the electrolyte in contact therewith and tit thus helps distributing polarity and current over the main active electrode layer. A preferred embodiment of the resilient spacer layer of the present invention is characterized in tat it consisTs of a substantially open mesh, planar, electroconductl e metal wire article or screen having an open network and is comprised of wire or fabric resistant to the electrolyte and the electrolysis products and in that some or all of the wires form a series of coils, waves or crimps or other undulating contour whose diameter or amplitude is substantially in excess of the wire thickness and preferably corresponds to the article thickness, along at least one directrix parallel to the plane of the article Of course such crimps or wrinkles are disposed in the direction across the thickness Qf the screen. These wrinkles In the form of crimps, coils, waves or te like have side porTions which are sloped or curved with respect to the axis normal to the thickness of the wrinkled fabric so that, whey the layer is compressed, some dislace ment and pressl is ttansmitted laterally so as to .make distribution of pressure more uniform over the electrode area or surface.Some coils or wire loops which, because of irregularities on the planarity or parallelism of the surface compressing the fabric, may be subjected to a compressive force greater than that acting on adjacent areas, are capable of yielding more to discharge the excess force by transmitting it o the neighboring coils or wire loops.Therefore, the fabric is effective in acting as a pressure equalizer to a substantial extent and in preventing the elastic reaction force acting on a single contact point to exceed the limit whereby the membrane is excessively pinched or pierced. Of ourse, such self adjusting capabilities of the resilient layer are also instrumental in obtaining 2 good and uniform contact distribution over the entire surface of the electrode. One very effective embodiment desirably consists o a series of helicoidal cylindrical spirals of wire whose coils are mutually wound with the ones of the adjacent spiral in an intermeshed or interlooped relationshi. The diameter of the spirals is 5 to 10 or more times the diameter of the wire of the spirals. According to this preferred arrange nent, the wire helix itself represents a very small portion of the volume enclosed tv the helix and therefore the helix is open on all sides thereby providing an interior channel to permit circulation of the electrolyte. It is not, however, necessary for ,the helicoidal cylindrical. spirals , to be wound in an interneshed relation ship with the adjacent spirals as previous described, and they may also consist of single adjacent metal wire spirals. In this case, the spirals are juxtaposed one beside another with the respective coils being merely engaged in an allerr.a e sequence. According to a further embodiment, the spacer layer , consists of a crimped knitted mesh or fabric of metal wire wherein every single wire forms a series of waves of an amplitude corresponding to the maximum height of the crimping of the knitted mesh or fabric. As an alternative, two or more .knitted meshes or fabrics, after being individually crimped by forming may be superimposed one upon another two obtain a layer of the desired thickness. The crimping of the metal mesh or fabric imparts to the layer a great compressibility and an outsC4nding resiliency to compression under a load which may be at least about 50 2000 grams per square centimeter cm2 of surface applying the pressure. The mat is capable of being compressed to a much lower thickness and volume. For example, it may be compressed to about 50 to 90 percent or even lesser percent of its initial volume and or thickness and is, therefore, pressed or compressed between the membrane and the active cathode layer. The mat is moveable or slideable with respect to the adjacent surfaces of the membrane and of the active cathode layer between which it is compressed. When clamping pressure is applied the wire loops or coils constituting the resilient mat may deflect and slide laterally and distribute pressure uniformly over the entire surfaces with which it contacts. A large portion of the clamping pressure of the cell is elastically memorized by every single coil or wave of the metal wires forming the spacer layer.ffi Preferably, the resilient mat is compressed to about 20 to 30 per cent of its original uncompressed thickness under a compression pressure which is comprised between 50 and 2000 grams per square centimeter of projected area. Even in its compressed state, the resilient mat must be highly porous and the ratio between the voids volume and the apparent volume of the compressed mat expressed in percentage is advantageously at least 75 rarely below 50 and prefer ably is comprised between 85 and 968. The diameter of the wire utilized may vary within a wide range depending on the type of forming or texturing being low enough in any event to obtain the desired character istics of resiliency and deformation at the cell assemly pressure. An assembly pressure corresponding to a load between 50 and 500 g cm2 of electrodic surface is normally required to obtain a good electrical contact between the active cathode layer and the cooperating current distribution structures or collectors although higher pressures may be used. It has been found that by providing a deformation of the resilient spacer layer of the invention of about 1.5 to 3 millimeters mm which corresponds to a compression not greater than 60 of the thickness of the non compressed article, at a pressure of about 400 glum2 cf projected surface a contact pressure at the active cathode layer may be obtained within the above cited limits also in cells with a hg. surface development and with deviations from planarity up to 2 millimeters per meter mm m . The metal wire diameter is preferably between 0.1 or even less and 0.3 millimeters, while the thickness of the non com.Jres sed article, that s, either the coils diameter or the a.mpl ..ucn of the crimping is 5 or more times the wire diameter, preferably in the range of 4 to 10 millimeters. Thus it will be apparent that the compressible section encloses a large free volume, i.e.the porportion of occupied volume which s free and open to electrolyte flow and gas flow. In the wrinkled which includes these compressing wire helixes fabrics described above, this percent of free volume is about 75 of the total volume occupied by the fabric and this percent of free volume rarely should be less than 25 and preferably should not be less than 50, Pressure drop in the flow of gas and electrolyte through such a fabric is negligible. The invention herein conTemplated may be applied to an electrolytic cell such as the one diagram.imatically illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic horizontal sectional view of the cell having the double layer electrode installed therein, and Figure 2 is a diagrammatic vertical secticnal vew of the cell of Fig. 1. As shown, the cell comprises an anode end plate 1 and a cathode end plate 2, both mounted in a vertical plane with each end plate in the form of a channel having side walls restectively enclosing an anode space 3 and a cathode space 4. Each end plate also has a peripheral seal surface on sid .al3 projecting on each side of the cell from the plane of the respective end plate, 5 being the anode seal surface and 6, being the cathode seal surface. These surfaces, with the interposition of suitable gaskets, not shown in the drawing, bear against a membrane or diaphragm 7, which stretches across the enclosed space between the side walls separating anode from cathode. The anode 8 may comprise a relatively rigid uncompress ible sheet of expanded titanium metal or other perforate, anodically resistant substrate preferably having a non passivatable coating thereon such as a metal or oxide or mixed oxide of a platinum group metal. This sheet is sized to fit within the side walls of the anode back plate and is supported rather rigidly by spaced electroconductive ribs 109 which are fastened to and project from the web or base of the anode end plateplate 1. The spaces between the ribs provide for ready flow of anolyte which is fed into the bottom and withdrawn from. the top owl such spaces. The entire end plate and ribs may be of graphite and alternatively, it may be of titanium clad steel or other suitable material. The rib ends bearing against the anode sheet 108 may or not be coated, e.g. with platinum or like metal to improve electrical contact and the anode sheet S may, if desired, be welded to the ribs 9. The anode rigid foraminous sheet 8 is held firmly in an upright position TLs sheet may be of expanded metal having upwardly inclining open ings 10 directed away from the membrane see Fig. 2 to deflect rising gas bubbles towards the space S and away from the membrane. On the cathode side, ribs 11 extend outward from the base of the cathode end plate 2 a distance which is a fraction of the entire depth of the cathode space 4. These ribs are spaced across the cell to provide parallel space for vertical electvo lyte flow from bottom to top and engage the cathode, which is in sheet or layer form. The cathode end plate and ribs may be made of steel or a nickel iron alloy or other cathodically resistant electroconductive material. On the conductive ribs 11 is welded a relatively rigid pressure plate 12, which is perforate and readily allows circulation of electrolyte from one side thereof to the other.Generally these openings or louvers are inclined upward and away from the membrane or compressible electrode toward the spece 4 see also Fig. 2 The pressure plate is electroconductive and serves to impart cathodic polarity to the electrode and to apply pressure thereto and it may be made of expanded metal or heavy screen of steel, nickel, copper or alloys thereof. The main or active cathode layer may advantageously be made of a fine flexible screen 13 of a cathodically resistant electroconductive material, such as nickel, stainless steel, iron, copper or alloys thereof, coated with a cathodically resistant catalytic material having a low hydrogen overvoltage. Many catalytic materials for hydrogen evolution in caustic solutions are known in the art, particularly suitable materials are the noble metals such as platinum, rutheni um, palladium, rhodium, iridium and osmium, their alloys and oxides, Raney nickel, molybdenum and tungsten alloys. Any of these materials can he used successfully to coat the cathode screen. The resiliently compressible spacer layer 14, interposed between membrane 7 and the main active layer 1 may be made of a crimped corrugated or wrinkled compressible wire mesh fabric which fabric is advantageously an open mesh knitted wire mesh of the type described in U.S. Patent No. 4,343,630, wherein the wire strands are knitted into a relatively flat fabric with inerlocking loops.This fabric is then crimped cr wrinkled into a wave or undulating form with the waves being close together, for example 0.3 to 2 centimeters apart, and the overall thickness of the compressible fabric is 2 to 10 millimelers. The crimps may be in a zig zag or herringbone pattern and the mesh of the fabric is coarser, i.e. has a larger pore size than that of screen 13. In this preferred embodiment the resiliently compressible space layer 14 is instrumental in providing for a good electrical contact between the pressure plate 12 and the main or active cathode layer 13, which is pressed by the spacer layer 14 against the current distributor pressure plate 12 uniformly over the entire electrode surface. The resiliently compressible spacer layer 14, also presses and maintains the flexible membrane 7 be ring against the rigid foraminous anode 8, thus preventing its movement and fluttering in the cell. The layer 14 effectively spaces the surface of the main or active cathode layer from the membrane of an easily predetermined distance which preferably may be comprIsed between 1 and 4 mm. Since the spacer layer 14 has a higher hydrqgen bvervoltage than the active layer 13, the electrode reactions take place substantially at the surface of the catalytic screen 13 and because of the very open structure of the compressed layer 14 of fine metal wire. The products of the electrode reaction are easily diluted and quickly removed from the surface of the membrane, hus effectively preventing high 6oncentration gradients across the surface of the membrane. In the operation of this embodiment, substantially saturated sodium chloride aqueous solution is fed into the bottom of the anolyte compartment of the cell and flows upward through channels or spaces 3 between ribs 9 and depleted brine and evolved chlorine escapes from the top of the cell Water or dilute sodium hydroxide is fed into the bottom of the cathode chamber and rises through channels 4 as well as through the voids of the compressed spacer layer 14 and evolved hydrogen and alkali is withdrawn from the top of the cell. Electrolysis is caused bX imparting a direct current electric potential between the anode and cathode end plates. As shown in Fig. 2, the openings in pressure plate 12 are louvered to provide an inclined outlet directed upwardly away from the compressed fabric layer 14, whereby some portion of evolved hydrogen and or electrolyte escapes to the rear electrolyte chamber 4. Therefore, the vertical spaces at the back of the pressure, plate 12 and the space occupied by the compressed fabric 14 are provided for upward catholyte and gas flow. According to the improved method of this invention for the electrolysis of sodium chloride, aqueous brine containing from 140 to 300 grams per liter of sodium chloride is circulat ed within the anode compartment of the cell. Chlorine. s evolved at the anode, while the solvated ions tend to migrate through the cation membrane and reach the cathode where caustic soda of substantial concentration above 15 20 by W2 weigh and hydrogen is evolved. Solutions containing 25 to 40 by weight of alkali metal hydroxide may be produced with anode and cathode efficiency cies above 90t, frequently above 94 . The following exam. les are illustrative EYA 4PLE A laboratory size electrolytic cell was manufactjred having an effective electrode area 100 millimeters mm high and 100 millimeters mm wide. The cell frames and back plates were made of titanium for the anodic portion and of stainless steel AISI 316 for the cathodic portion. The anode was an expanded titanium sheet 1,5 mm thick, coated with a non passivatable catalytic coating of a mixture of oxides of Ruthenium and Titanium in the respective weight ratio of 1 to 1, as referred to the metals, obtained by thermal decomposition of a solution of the salts of the metals. The depth of the anode chamber behind the anode was 12 millimeters mm . The membrane was a laminated sheet having a thickness of about 0.25 mm, comprising two layers of cation exchange resin laminated together with an interlayer of a poiytetrafl oro ethylene screen, as mechanical support. The two layers are mace of a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and a perfluorovlnyl ether, one containing sulphonic groups and the other containing carboxylic groups. The membrane was assembled in the cell with its carboxylic layer facing the catholyte compartment. The cathode structure comprised a a current collector in the form of a perforated sheet of AISI 316, 2.0 millimeters thick, provided with hole of diameter 3.0 mm, with a pitch of 5 mm, welded on AISI 315 vertical ribs. The depth or the cathode chamber behind the current collector sQren was i millieters. b a main or catalytic cathode layer in ths T rff. of 25 me ST nickel screen coated with a 7 to 8 gram per square meter loading of an alloy of ruthenium 80 to 85 percent and nickel 15 to 20 percent , providing for an exceptionally low hydrogen overvoltage. c a resiliently compressed spacer layer in the form of a mat made of three double layers of loosely knitted nickel wire of a diameter of 0.11 millimeters. The catalytic cathode layer b was interposed between the rigid current collector a and the resilient spacer layer c and, upon the clamping together of the cell, the current collector was compressing the resilient mat against the surface of the membrane, which membrane was bearing in turn against the rigid anode. The compression corresponding to a pressure of about 400 gram per square centimeter was reducing the thickness of the resilient mat, interposed between the active cathode screen and the membrane, from its original uncompressed thickness of about 6 mm down to about 2.7 millimeters. Therefore, the distance between the surface of the anode and the surface of the active cathode layer was about 2.7 millimeters plus the thickness of the membrane, that is practically it was comprised between 2.7 and 2.8 millimeters. The cell operated at the following conditions Current density 3000 A m2 Anolyte concentration 175 g l of saCl Catholyte concentration 30 by wt. of NaOH Temperature 900C 10C Cell voltage 3.12 V 0.02 Cathodic current efficiency 94.5 z Oxygen in chlorine gas 0.1 ffi by volume. REFERENCE EXAMPLE The same cell described in Example 1 was disassembled and the main or catalytic cathode screen of coated nickel b was placed against the surface of the membrane, the resilient mat of knitted nickel wire c was placed between the rigid current collector a and the active cathode screen. Upon re assembly of the cell, the resilient mat was compressed down to a thickness of about 2.7 mm, thereby pressing the active cathode screen against the surface of the membrane. Therefore, the distance between the. surface of the anode and the surface of the cathode corresponded to the thickness of the membrane, that is about 0.25 millimeters. The cell was operated at exactly the same conditions as indicated in the previous example and the results were as follows Cell voltage 3.19 V 0.02 Cathodic current efficiency 93 t Oxygen in chlorine gas 0.5 by volume The method of the invention may be practiced wi.h any type of ion permeable membrane. The membrane may be of the monolayer type o it may be a laminated membrane comprising different layers made of different ion exchange resins and the membrane may also include reinforcing fibers or fabrics. The su foces of the membrane may be modified either in their chemical composition or in their physical morphology, for example the membrane may have a roughened surface. Also the membrane mayohave a porous layer of resin or of particulate material forming a microporous layer over the surface of the membrane, said layer being either conductive or non conduotive in character. As it will be obvious to the expert, the current distribution means which in the preferred embodiment described in the accompanying drawings are depicted in the form which comprises a substantially rigid foraminous plate 12, may be of different nature, for example the active cathode screen 1 may be pressed by the resilient wire mat directly against the vertical ribs 11, extending from the cathode end plate. Preferably in the latter case te active cathode screen 13 can be made of a heavier gauge screen and the distribution of the vertical ribs may be made more dense, that is with a larger number of ribs per unit of width of the cell compartment, in order to provide sufficient number of electric contact between the active screen and the current distribution means.
