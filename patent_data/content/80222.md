## Description
GRANULAR DETERGENT COMPOSITIONSCONTAINING AN INTIMATELY ADMIXED ANIONIC SURFACTANT AND AN ANIONIC POLYMER TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to granular detergent compositions containing an anionic surfactant and an anionic water soluble polymer in intimate admixture. The compositions Herein dispcrse and dissolve more rapidly in the laundering solution than similar compositions with surfactant alone. The dispersibility and solubility of granular detcrgent compositions presents a challenge and dilemma to those whc. formulate and process such compositions. The spray dried form of such compositions has provided generally satisfactcbry dispersibility and solubility if the individual components are soluble or dispersible in water. The spray dried form, howovcr, requires acceptance of a relatively low density no higher than 0.4 0.5 grams per milliliter to obtain substantial porosity.The porosity, of course, provide a speed of solubility benefit.Higher density granular detergent compositions can be made by various mechanical mixing and agglomeration processes but solubility rate generally becomes less satisfactoryz It is an object of this invention to improve the dispersibility and solubility of granular detergent compositions that are made by processes that provide higher densities than are available from conventional spray drying processes. The invention is, however, applicable to any detergent compositions within the broad scope of the Inven tion as described.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention there is provided a granular detergent comprising a from 3 to 40 of a non soap anionic surfactant b from 5 to 85 by weight of a water soluble neutral or alkaline salt and mixtures thereof and c from 1 to 50 by weight of the non soap anionic surfactant of a water soluble anionic polymer having an average molecular weight of from 300 to 15,000 and at least 1 ionizable site per 200 unites of molecular weight, said detergent composition being prepared by forming an intimate mixture of said surfactant and said polymer before said surfactant and polymer contact a major portion of the other components of said granular detergent composition. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The granular detergent compositions of the present invention contain the following essential components I non soap anionic surfactant, 2 water soluble salts and 3 water soluble anionic polymer. The compositions herein are prepared by any suitable process that will result in the intimate admixture of surfactant and polymer. The intimate admixture can be accomplished by drying a solution or slurry containing the polymer and surfactant or their precursors. Subsequent processing including incorporation of water soluble salts and optional ingredients should avoid steps that result in appreciable solution of the polymerisurfactant mixture in the presence of other water soluble components. An admixture of surfactant and polymer can be mixed with other components prior to spray drying if the total water content in the resultant paste or slurry contains no more than 508 water by weight. Under such conditions the intimate admixture of surfactant and polymer is maintained.Agglomeration and dry mixing techniques are particularly suitable in the practice of the present invention for producing complete granular detergent compositions while maintaining an intimate admixture of surfactant and polymer. While not bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the polymers which are useful in the compositions of this inven tion provide their benefit by eliminating or retarding the formation of a highly viscous gum phase of anionic surfactant and water which acts to retard granule dissolution. Surfactant The detergent compositions herein contain from . 3 to 40 by weight of non soap anionic surfactant, preferably from 4 to 35 and more preferably from 5t to 30 . In relatively high sudsing detergent compositions the non soap anionic surfactant generally represents from 10 to 35 , and preferably from 128 to . 30 , by weight of the detergent composition. Surfactants useful herein are listed in U.S. Patent 3,664,961, Norris, issued May 23, 1972, and inU.S. Patent 3,919,678, Laughlin et al, issued Dec. 30, 1975. Useful non soap anionic surfactants also include tile watersoluble salts, preferably the alkali metal, ammonium and alkylolammonium salts, of organic sulfuric reaction products having in their molecular structure an alkyl group containing from 10 to 20 carbon atoms and a sulfonic acid or sulfuric acid ester group. Included in the term alkyl is the alkyl portion of aryl groups.

Specific preferred surfactants for use herein include sodium linear Cull 13 alkylbenzene sulfonate and the sodium salt of a sulfated condensation product of a C12 18 alcohol with I to 4 moles of ethylene oxide. The advantages obtained with the compositions and the process of the invention are particularly apparent when said compositions comprise a non soap anionic surfactant selected from the group comprising alkyl benzene sulfonates, olefin sulfonates and paraffin sulfonates. Water Soluble Neutral or Alkaline Salt The granular detergents of the present invention contain from 58 to 858, preferably from 10 to 708, and more preferably from 30 to 65 , by weight of water soluble neutral or alkaline salts. The neutral or alkaline salt has a pH In solution of seven or greater, and can be either organic or inorganic in nature. The salt assists in providing the.desired density and bulk to the detergent granules herein. SYhslet some of the salts are inert, many of them also function as a detergency builder. The neutral or alkaline water soluble salts useful in the practice of the invention are materials consistent with use in granular detergent compositions from such standpoints as biologiw cal safety. effect on environment, and physical and chemical properties. Sodium and potassium salts are particularly useful for reasons of cost and physical properties. Suitable salts may be inorganic or organic, monomeric or polymeric. Examples of neutral water soluble salts include the alkali metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium chlorides and sulfates.The alkali metal, and especially sodium, salts of the above arc.. preferred Sodiurn sulfate is typically used In detergent granules and is a particularly preferred salt herein.

Examples of nonphosphorus, inorganic builders are sodium and potassium carbonate, bicarbonate , sesquica rbonate, tetraborate decahydr3te, and silicates having a weight ratio of SiOjM to alkali metal oxide of from 0.5 to 4.0, preferably from 1.0 to 2,4. Water soluble. nonphosphorus organic builders useful herein include the various alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium polyacetates, carboxylates, polycarboxylates and polyhydroxy sulfonates. Examples of polyacetate and polycarboxylate builders are the sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of ethylene diarnine tetraacctic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, oxydisuccinic acid, mellitic acid, benzene polycarboxylic acids. and citric acid. Salts of nitrilotriacetic acid, such as sodium nitrilotriacetate, are particularly preferred. Polymeric polycarboxylate builders are set forth in U.S.Patent 3,308,067, Diehl, issued March 7, 1967, Such materials include the water soluble salts of homo and copolymers of aliphatic carboxylic acids such as maleic acid, Itaconic acid, mesaconic acid, fumaric acid, aconitic acid, citraconic acid and methylenemalonic acid. Some of these matcrials are useful as the water soluble anionic polymer as hereinafter described, but only if in intimate admixture with the non soap anionic surfactant. Other useful builders herein are sodium and potassium carboxymethyloxymalonate, carboxymethyloxysuccinate, cis cyclohexanehexacarboxylate, cis cyclopentanetetracarboxylatc, pllloro glucinol trisulfonate, and the copolymers of maleic anhydride with vinyl methyl ether or ethylene. Other suitable polycarboxylates for use herein are the polyacetal carboxylates described in U.S. Patent 4,1114,226, issuedMarch 13, 1979 to Crutchfield et al, and U.S. Patent Y, 9G,4Y5, issued March 27, 1979 to Crutch field et al. These polyacetal carboxylates can be prepared by bringing together under polymerization conditions an ester of glyoxylic acid and a polymerization initiator. The rosulting polyacetal carboxylate ester is then attached to chemically stable end groups to stabilize the polyacetal carboxylate against rapid depolymerization in alkaline solution, converted to the corresponding salt, and added to a detergent composition. Water soluble silicate solids represented by the formula SiO M20, M being an alkali metal, and having a SiO2 M2O weight ratio of from 0.5 to . 4.0, are useful salts in the compositions of the inventions at levels of from 2 to 15 on an anhydrous weight basis, preferably from 3 to 8 . Anhydrous or hydrated particulate silicate can be utilized. In one embodiment of the invention, a silicate water solution containing from 35 to 55 silicate solids can be used as an agglomerating agent. Water Soluble Anionic Polymer The compositions of the present invention also contain in intimate admixture with the non soap anionic detergent surfactant from 18 to 50 , preferably from 38 to 308, and more preferably from 58 to 208, by weight of the non soap anionic detergent surfactant of a water soluble anionic polymer with at least I ionizable site per 200 units of molecular weight, preferably at least about I ionizable site per 100 units of molecular weight. While some dispersion advantage is obtained with average polymer molecular weights as high as 50,000 average molecular weight preferably is from 300 to 15,000, and most preferably is from 1000 to 5,000.Also, the water soluble anionic polymers are preferably substantially or completely neutralized water soluble salts. As used herein, average molecular weight is on a polymer weight basis. Suitable polymers herein include homopolymers and copolymers of unsaturated aliphatic mono or polycarboxylic acids.Preferred carboxylic acids are acrylic acid, hydroxyacrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, aconitic acid, crotonic acid, and citraconic acid. The polycarboxylic acids e.g. maleic acid can be pplymerized in the form of their anhydrides and subsequently hydrolyzed. The copolymers can be formed of mixtures of the unsaturated carboxylic acids with or without other copolymerizable monomers, or they can be formed from single unsaturated carboxylic acids with other copolymeri . able monomers. In either case, the percentage by weight of the polymer units derived from noncarboxylic acids is preferably less than about 50 .Suitable copolymerizable monomers include, for example, vinyl chloride, vinyl alcohol, furan, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, styrene, vinyl methyl ether, vinyl ethyl ether, vinyl propyl ether, acrylamide, ethylene, propylene and 3 butenoic acid. Homo and copolymers of sulfonates, sulfates and phosphates of suitable monomers such as styrene, vinyl alcohol, vinyl chloride, etc., are particularly useful in the practice of the invention.Polystyrene sulfonate with a molecular weight in the range of from 2000 to 6000 is particularly useful in the practice of the invention. Other preferred polymers are the homopolymers and copolymers of acrylic acid, hydroxyacrylic acid, or methacrylic acid, and salts thereof, which in the case of the copolymers contain at least 508, and preferably at least 80 , by svaiglwt of units derived from the acid. Particularly preferred polymers are sodium polyacrylate and sodium polyhydroxyacrylate. The most preferred is sodium polyacrylate. Other specific preferred polymers are the homopolymers and copolymers of maleic anhydride, especially the copolymers with ethylene, styrene and vinyl methyl ether. These polymers are commercially available under trade names such as, for example, Gantrez AN. The polymerization of acrylic acid homo and copolymers can be accomplished using free radical initiators, such as alkali metal persulfates, acyl and aryl peroxides, acyl and aryl peresters and aliphatic azocompounds. The reaction can be carried out in situ or in aqueous or nonaqueous solutions or suspensions, Chainterminating agents can be added to control the molecular weight. The copolymers of maleic anhydride can be synthesized using any of the types of free radical initiators mentioned above in suitable solvents such as benzene or acetone, or in the absence of a solvent, under an inert atmosphere. These polymerization techniques are well known In the art, It will be appreciated that instead of using a single polymeric aliphatic carboxylic acid, mixtures of two or more polymeric aliphatic carboxylic acids can be used to prepare the above polymers. In general, natural polymers such as pectin, alginic acid, gum arabic and carragheenan and cellulose derivatives such as cellulose sulfate, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxybutyl cellulose are not particularly effective in the practice of the invention. Vinyl polymers without sufficient ionizable sites are likewise not particularly effective. In general, these deficiencies appear to be a result of a low ratio of ionizable sites to molecular weight or too high a molecular weight. Optional Ingredients Nonionic surfactants may be present in the compositions of the invention. Such nonionic materials include compounds produced by the condensation of alkylene oxide groups hydrophilic in nature with an organic hydrophobic compound, which may be aliphatic or alkyl aromatic in nature. The length of the polyoxyalkylene group which is condensed with any particular hydrophobic group can be readily adjusted to yield a compound having the desired degree of balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic elements. Suitable nonionic surfactants include the polyethylene oxide condensates of alkyl phenols, e.g., the condensation products of alkyl phenols having an alkyl group containing from 6 to 15 carbon atoms, in either a straight chain or branched chain configuration, with from 3 to 12 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alkyl phenol.

This includes alkali metal soaps such as the sodium, potassium, ammonium, and .lkyl olammonium salts of higher fatty acids containing from 8 to 24 carbon atoms, and preferably from 12 to 18 carbon atoms. Soaps can be made by direct saponification of fats and oils or by the neutralization of free fatty acids. Particularly useful are the sodium and potassium salts of the mixtures or fally acids derived from coconut oil and tallow, t.e,, sodium or potas sium.tallow and coconut soap.

The resulting spray dried granules were dry mixed with the following components Component PartsTetrasodium pyrophosphate 41.26Sodium carbonate 5.21Perfume, enzymes, dust control agents 1.43 47.9 parts The water dispersibility of the resulting composition was substantially superior to a composition containing the same ingredients except no sodium polyacrylate avg. m.w. 2000 and to a composition containing the same ingredients in which the sodium polyacrylate avg. m.w. 2000 was not admixed with the anionic surfactant paste prior to mixture with other ingredients. EXAMPLE VI The following composition was prepared Sodium linear C12 alkylbenzene sulfonate, Sodium Polyacrylate, and sodium sulfate flake LAS SPA 7.10 Dobanol 45E7 nonionic surfactant C14 15 alcohol polyethoxy 7 12.97Sodium tripolyphosphate anhydrous 24.00 Sodium carboxymethylcellulose CMC 1.22Sodium silicate 7v41 Maleic anhydride methyl vinyl ether copolymer Mwt 250,000 1.33 Sodium perborate tetrahydrate 28.8Magnesium sulphate 0.74Fluorescer 0.34Enzyme 1.33Suds suppressor 15 silica 85 silicone 0.34 Water miscellaneous Balance The sodium silicate, sodium tripolyphosphate, maleic any ride copolymer, CMC, magnesium sulphate and fluorescer, were first formed into a crutcher mix of moisture content 42 and spray dried to give a granular powder of density 650 70 gllitre and moisture content of 7 . This granular base powder was fed into a 3 diameter Patterson Kelley zig zag blender and the nonionic surfactant sprayed on at a temperature of 400C over a period of two minutes. Mixing was allowed to continue for a further 8. minutes after which the powder density was 800 830 g litre. The sodium perborate, suds suppressor ingredients and enzyme were then dry mixed into the nonionic containing powder by means of a Vertomix in line mixer made by Babcock GardenerLtd., Middleway, St. Blazey, Cornwall, England resulting in a powder of density 790 800 g litre. The product was passed through a 20 mesh sieve and the oversize recycled for further size reduction. The LAS SPA flalce was made from an aqueous slurry of solids content 50 by weight, in which the solids cornprise 90 LAS paste, 10 sodium polyacrylate Goodrite K 759, a sodium polyacrylate of molecular wt. 2100 made by GoodrichChemical Group, Cleveland, Ohio, USA . This slurry was dried on rollers heated by 35 psi steam and removed as a flake of thickness 0.25mm comprising 80 LAS, 10 sodium polyacrylate, 7 sodium sulfate, 3 moisture. The flake was broken up by 10 minutes agitation in a cube mixer and the portion passing through a 20 mesh sieve was used as a dry additive in the product. Addition of the LAYS SPA flake to the remainder of the product was carried out in a Vertomix, using the same procedure as for the dry mixing of the other ingredients, to give a finished product density of 750 grams liter. The finished product had a particle size distribution as follows On 14 Mesh Tyler 0 On 20 Mesh 2.88 On 36 Mesh 18.5 On 72 Mesh 39,7. On 100 Mesh 14.18 On t50 Mesh 18 Through 150 Mesh 7.096 Dispersion and solubility of the finished product in water was excellent. The product of Example VI is prepared with a LASiSPA flake thickness of 0.10 mm and a LASISPA flake thickness of 0.5n mm.Comparable dispersion and solubility is obtained. EXAMPLE VII The present invention is also helpful in reducing product loss in the sump or drain plug connection of front loading washing machines. In such machines, the sump comprises the drain plug which is located at the lowest point of the machine and a short length of piping which connects the plug either to the external casing or to part of the wash water recirculation system.Product is added to the washing machine via a dispenser, the contents of which are flushed by a stream of cold water into the external casing of the machine at the start of the cycle. Any component of the product having a low rate of solubility in cold water tends to collect in the sump and this tendency is enhanced by the formation of viscous surfactant phases which cause aggregation of other components. This tendency Is particularly noticeable when anionic surfactant is dry mixed with the remainder of the formulation and compositions in accordance with the present invention can be shown to overcome this problem. The following compositions were prepared a A flaked composition comprising 88.9 NaLAS 7.8 Na2SO4 miscellaneous 3.3 H2O b A flaked composition comprising 80 NaLAS 10 Sodium polyacrylate Mw 2000 7 Na2504 miscellaneous 3 H2O Both flake compositions were prepared as In Example Vi above. In a model test using a funnel fitted with a length of tubing to simulate a washing machine sump and adapted to trap undissolved material, the percentage of the initial formulation remaining as a residue in the sump was Sample a 17.1 Sample b 4.596
