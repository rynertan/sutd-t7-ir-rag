# Rupturable containers for fluids such as photographic processing fluids and photographic film units including such containers of processing fluids.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein are containers C for holding fluids, e.g. photographic processing materials, in photographic film units. The containers C have strong seals along certain marginal areas 13 and relatively weak seals along other marginal areas. The weak seals are designed to open and distribute fluid over a sheet of film or paper when pressure is applied to the container in a camera. Each weak seal is formed from a sealing composition comprising a copolymer of a at least 50 percent, by weight, of a polymerizable monomer having the formula I
