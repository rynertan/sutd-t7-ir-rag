# Hot melt adhesive compositions.

## Abstract
This invention relates to hot melt adhesive compositions which include a highly unsaturated hydrocarbon rubber or neoprene, about 5 to about 100 parts by weight of neutral ised sulphonated EPDM terpolymer per 100 parts by weight of the highly usaturated hydrocarbon rubber or neoprene, wherein the neutralised sulphonated EPDM terpolymer has about 5 to about 50 meq. of neutralised sulphonate groups per 100 grams of the neutralised sulphonated EPDM terpoly mer, and about 25 to about 200 parts by weight of a hydrocarbon resin derived from polymerisation of petroleum or coal distillates consisting of dienes, mono and di olefins and cyclic olefins having 5 or 6 carbon atoms per 100 parts by weight of the highly unsaturated hydrocarbon rubber or neoprene.
