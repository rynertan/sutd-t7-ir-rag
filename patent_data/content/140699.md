# DISK MOUNTING ARRANGEMENT

## Abstract
A seed disk in a vacuum seed meter has a central mounting aperture in the form of a slot widening to a circu lar hole at its centre. When the disk is mounted on the hub of the seed meter a correspondingly shaped raised portion of the hub is received in the aperture to key the disk to the hub and a correspondingly shaped handle 24 passes through the aperture. The handle is retained rotatably on a shaft by a cap 56 and a coil spring under the cap urges the handle towards the hub. After the disk has been fitted, the handle is rotated as indicated by arrow 76 and the arms 60, 62 of the handle ride up ramps 34, 36 until the arms click into de tent recesses 82, 80 .
