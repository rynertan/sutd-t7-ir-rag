# Infra red radiation detector.

## Abstract
An infra red radiation detector comprises a pyroelectric detector element 1 in an hermetically sealed housing 9,20 . The housing comprises a base 9 and cover 20 with an aperture 10 . A Fresnel lens 18 for example made of polyethylene transmissive in the 8 14Âµm wavelength range is fastened over the aperture on the inside of the cover for condensing the radiation to be detected onto the detector element. In one example the Fresnel lens is held fast against a flange 17 surrounding the aperture for example by a push fit ring 21 . Alternatively the Fresnel lens is glued to a silicon window 25 which in turn is fastened to the flange 17 over the aperture 10 . The Fresnel lens thus forms an integral part of the detector housing avoiding the need for external mirrors or lenses.
