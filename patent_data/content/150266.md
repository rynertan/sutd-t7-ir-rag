# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE LEAK TESTING OF FILTERS

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for the leak testing of filters 30 arranged in series in a housing, comprises supply pipes 40, 41 for introducing DOP particles within the housing and immediately upstream of each filter, and a hinged restric tion member 54a, 54b mounted in the housing upstream of each filter and downstream of the location at which the DOP is introduced for mixing the airstream and DOP and then dispersing the mixture over the full frontal area of the adja cent filter. A sampling device 70b, 70c is mounted down stream of each filter for monitoring the airstream to detect DOP particles and thereby permit a determination as to whether any particles are leaking through or around the filter. The restriction member 54b disposed between the filters serves the dual purpose of mixing the airstream and any leaking particles, during testing of the upstream filter, preparatory to monitoring of the airstream by the sampling device 70b , as well as mixing the airstream and the parti cles introduced by the adjacent upstream supply pipes 40, 41 , preparatory to dispersing the mixture over the full fron tal area of the downstream filter, during testing of the latter.
