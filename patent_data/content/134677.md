# Radiation activatable anaerobic adhesive composition.

## Abstract
An anaerobic adhesive composition activatable by ultra voilet or visible radiation which forms strong bonds with lapped surfaces and which is comprised of an anaerobically polymerizable acrylate ester monomer a compound which decomposes upon exposure to ultraviolet or visible light radiation to release a strong acid a peroxy free radical initiator capable of initiating the polymerization of the monomer upon substantial exclusion of oxygen and an activator of anaerobic polymerization which, in the presence of a strong acid, reacts with the peroxide initiator to produce free radicals to catalyze the anaerobic polymerization of the monomer.
