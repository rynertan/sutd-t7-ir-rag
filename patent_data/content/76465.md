# Transaxle final drive arrangement for reducing drive torque reaction transmitted to engine and transmission unit.

## Abstract
The final drive arrangement 12 of an automotive transaxle 10 is provided with a gearing 30 between the differential gear 26 and one of the driven wheels which reverses the rotation of the output of the final drive unit and then re reverses the same so that both of the driven wheels rotate in the same direction but the reaction inputted to the final drive unit from each of the driven wheels negates or offsets the other.
