## Description
The present invention is directed to a breathing mask and more specifically to a mask comprising a device for introducing liquid substances to the user of the mask. More particularly the invention is directed to a mask comprising a device for conveying liquid substances under pressure from a container to the mouth of the user provided with a mask of elastomeric material apt to protect the face and the respiratory tract. The field of application of the device forming the object of the invention, is directed to the breathing masks worn by operators having tasks of watching in ambients contaminated by toxic substances or also by staff used to carry out functions and operations in ambients polluted in consequence of war events. Breathing masks comprising devices of the cited type are already known from DE A 26 45 151. In these known masks the said devices comprise a tubular conduit disposed entirely inside the mask with one end in communication with a hole provided on the facepiece of the mask, with which a nozzle of a tube connected to an outer container can be engaged. In the non drinking or rest position the said tubular conduit is in a position spaced from the user s mouth. If the user desires to drink he must move the tubular conduit to a position in proximity of this mouth. To this end the user must unscrew the cap of an exhalating valve and actuate a lever structure by rotating it. By said rotation the tubular conduit can be moved to a position in proximity of the user s mouth and vice versa. In an other embodiment in order to move the tubular conduit to a position in proximity of the user s mouth, the user must excert pressure on an insert of the exhalation valve or on the part of the elastic facepiece adjacent to said insert. When the pressure is released the tubular conduit reassumes its rest position spaced from the user s mouth. In both embodiments when the user desires to drink, apart form engaging the nozzle with the tubular conduit, the user is obliged to perform additionally operations by which the drinking action becomes complicated. Moreover, the construction of the breathing mask itself becomes more complicated. Breathing masks comprising devices of the cited type are also known from US A 3 645 261. Generally said devices associated to breathing masks of elastomeric material comprise mostly a tubular conduit disposed inside the mask connected to a tube disposed outside the mask for the introduction of liquid substances collected in a suitable container of rubber or other like deformable material. According to this solution the tubular conduit disposed inside the mask is maintained at a first rest position through a suitable lever articulated to a rigid structure integral with the mask. Said lever on its turn is subjected to the action of a return spring to press the conduit into the cited rest position and through a suitable tooth is subjected to the action of a rotating cam which is set in action with a suitable crank mechanism to win the action of the spring and to bring the conduit from the rest position to a position in proximity of the user s mouth. The elastomeric tube disposed outside the mask comprises the end part enclosed in a suitable bag of the mask. The actuation of the device for the introduction of liquid substances takes place by means of the following steps Unfortunately the cited solution is unsatisfactory. In fact both the lever system to move the tubular conduit from the first to the cited effective position and the outer part, i.e. the connection tube, constitute sources of possible irregular workings for problems of calibration of the spring or for possible defects in manufacturing or for small inaccuracies of assembling of the mechanical parts. In fact it is to be considered firstly that the miniaturization of the mechanical parts, miniaturization made necessary by the pre arrangement of said parts in the small space usually obtainable in the masks, requires assembling steps not always verifiable with accuracy. In particular one of the possible risks of having an anomalous working in the cited device derives from the possible stage between the operation cam and the lever tooth, which are the elements necessary for moving the tube from the idle position to the effective position. Finally there is to be considered the circumstance of carrying out a double operation for the double mechanical system to be provided, both for the introduction of the end part element of the outer tube to the container and for the movement of the inner tubular conduit between the two positions. Therefore the aim of the present invention is a breathing mask comprising a device for introducing liquid substances between a container and the mask devoid of any of the cited drawbacks. The object of the present invention is a breating mask of elastomeric material for the protection of a user s face and respiratory tract comprising a device comprising a tubular conduit 4 for introducing liquid substances from an outer container to a user of the mask, said container including a syringe shaped nozzle attached to one end of said container, said masks being characterized by the fact that said tubular conduit is disposed entirely inside the mask with one end in communication with a hole provided on the facepiece of the mask, said conduit comprising at least one elbow portion of elastomeric material which is substantially curvilinear in shape and elastically deformable between a first rest position in which the other end of the conduit is remote from the user s mouth and a second operative position, in which said other end is in proximity of the user s mouth, said second position resulting from said syringe shaped nozzle being introduced via said hole inside said conduit over the entire elbow portion and said first position resulting from said nozzle being removed from said elbow portion. The present invention will be better understood by the following detailed description made by way of non limiting example with reference to the figures of the attached sheets of drawing in which Figure 1 shows a breathing mask for protecting the face and the respiratory tract of a user. A device 2 is associated to the mask 1 for introducing liquid substances from a suitable container not shown of deformable material, for instance rubber, provided with one end 3 having the shape of a syringe or like penetrating element. The device 2 Figure 2 comprises mainly tubular conduit 4 entirely arranged inside the mask and a cylindrical shaped rigid body 5 of plastic material associated to a wall of the mask of elastomeric material. The tubular conduit 4 of elastomeric material, as shown in detail in the Figure 2, is constitute by at least an elbow portion substantially in the form of a curvilinear connector with the angle between the two parts of the elbow connector greater than 90 , for instance of 120 . As shown in Figure 2 the tubular conduit comprises at the elbow portion 6 a marked thickness dissymmetry said dissymmetry is suitably studied to give a particular spring effect useful for the working of the device as it will be explained later on. Preferably, examining a cross section of the zone 6 of the conduit, the dissymmetry extend for an arc lesser than 180 . The tubular conduit 4 comprises one flared end 7 apt to be seized by the user and a further flanged end 8 formed by a flange inserted in the cylindrical body 5. Said rigid cylindrical body 5 is divided into two parts by a wall or a dividing partition 9 provide with a central hole 10. The wall 9 separates two cylindrical chambers 11 and 12 both threaded on their inner wall to receive two small cylinders 13 and 14. A cylinder is provided with a central hole 15 having dimensions corresponding to the out ones of a syringe shaped nozzle 3 or like pen trating element, and the other is provided with central opening 15 corresponding to the out dimensions of the conduit 4 in proximity of its flanged ends. The cylinder 14 is screwed on the corresponding chamber 12 to press in a tight manner the flange 8 of the conduit 4. The cylinder 13 is in its turn screwed on the wall of the cylindrical chamber 11 and presses a discshaped sealing membrane 16 realized with a selfsealing elastomeric material. Said cylinders 13 and 14 comprise means apt to allow its removal from the corresponding chambers of the body 5. Preferably said means are realized in the for of two pins 18, 19, and 20, 21 for each cylinder respectively, arranged in a diametrically oppose position on the front surfaces of the cite cylinders. Alternatively said pins could be realized with facing grooves so as to permit through the introduction of suitable tools the unscrewing of said small cylinders exerting suitable torques. The device is associated to the mask with connecting means, indicated by way of example in Figures 2 and 3 with a flange 22 projecting from the lateral surface of the rigid body, having a thread 23 which is outside the rigid body and a locking nut 24. The position of inserting and blocking the device on the mask is effected by introducing the device into a suitable hole provided on the facepiece of the mask and blocking the mask wall comprised between the flange 22 and the nut 24. The liquid feeding is made through the previously described device as follows The introduction of the liquid substances takes place when the user deforms mechanically the container and consequently makes the liquid substances flow through the syringe shaped nozzle. In the following step of removing the syringeshaped nozzle there is obtained The invention achieves the aimed purposes. In fact the introduction of liquid substances under pressure is made directly between the end part of the container, i.e. the syringe shaped nozzle 3, and the tubular conduit 4 disposed inside the mask. Therefore in the present solution there is not present a further tube or conduit arranged outside the mask acting as intermediate element between the container and the conduit disposed inside the mask. Consequently the user of the mask not only avoids one of the manual operations foreseen in the previous technique, but also avoids the raising of any mechanical drawback deriving from the presence of connection outside the mask, particularly those as already said caused by the need of making recourse to a tightness realized with a closing valve comprising mainly a spherical or cylindrical rigid body and an opposing spring. The present solution overcomes the drawbacks deriving from the prior art since, as indicated in the description the tightness between outer ambient and inner tubular conduit avails itself of an elastomeric membrane whose geometrical characteristic of being a thin disc line membrane joined to the chemical physical characteristic, relating to a self sealing composition, guarantees the cited sealing function in absence of any mechanical drawback, both before the perforation of the sealing strip with the syringe shaped nozzle, and on removal of the syringe shaped nozzle from the device. Then it is understandable that it is possible, in case of need, to substitute the elastomeric sealing with another one available from stock by exerting first a light screwing torque and then an unscrewing torque on the small cylinder 13 projecting out of the mask. The now cited favourable circumstances cannot be found in the known solutions, since any possible anomaly on valve the conventional masks does not appear to be promptly remediable by the user. Also the present invention overcomes the further drawbacks deriving from the state of the art due to the presence of complicated mechanical lever systems necessary to move the feeding tubular conduit disposed inside the mask between two distinct positions and i.e. from the idle non operative rest position to the operative position and vice versa. In fact here the recourse to a tubular conduit provided with an elbow connector of elastomeric material, gives to the conduit itself an intrinsic characteristic of opposing spring. Consequently there is both an opposition to any movement which tends to change the rest profile of the conduit and the immediate return to the not deformed position as any spring would make, on removing the cause which could deform the rest profile in the specific case following the removal of the syringe shaped nozzle from the mask. Although some particular advantageous embodiments of the invention have been described, it is to be kept in mind that this invention includes in its scope also alternative embodiments accessible to the technicians of the field and deriving from the inventive principles herebefore explained. For instance according to an alternative embodiment the tubular conduit disposed inside the mask could be realized with an elastomeric material only in the elbow conduit portion and said portion could be then associated through pipe wrench clamps to possible further rigid tubular parts having material different from the elastomeric one, for instance a metallic or plastic material. Moreover the angle between two convergent portions to determine the elbow portion could be different from that which is shown and described.
