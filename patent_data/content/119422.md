# INDUCTANCE SIMULATION CIRCUIT

## Abstract
An inductance simmulation circuit for connection be tween data handling apparatus, such as a modem, and a transmission line 3 includes an inductance simulation cir cuit 12 for providing a low d.c. resistance to allow circula tion of a line holding current, whilst presenting a high a.c. shunt impedance to the audio data tones on the line. The simulation circuit 12 comprises two transistors 13, 14 connected as a high gain amplifier across an input resistor 22 in the modem line coupling circuit 1 24 . The audio tones are fed to the input of the amplifier via a capacitor 18 and the amplifier applies amplified tone signals across the input resistor to augment the tones thereacross. The con ductive transistors also act as a low resistance connected across the input resistor for the passage of the line holding current. The simulation circuit acts, in effect, as an induc tance, withouth the use of inductive components. The input resistor is effectively connected, in series with two zener diodes 9, 10 , across the line, and the series circuit receives the line voltage and produces therefrom positive and nega tive power supplies 7, 11 for energising the entire modem. No further power supply is necessary. The coupling circuit also includes a rectifier bridge 4 , or a relay with change over contacts, for ensuring that the current flow in the series circuit 9, 10, 22 is of the correct polarity, irrespective of the polarity of the line voltage. Data signals are fed into and out of the modem via optocouplers 49, 95 so that dangerous voltages cannot reach the modem and thence the line. The modem may be constructed as an integrated circuit on a single chip with relatively few discrete components.
