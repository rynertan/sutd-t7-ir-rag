## Description
NOVEL FUNGICIDAL COLMBINATION AND ITS USE AND FORMULATIONS. ranis invention relates to a novel combination particularly effective in controlling fungal infections of cultivated plants. Many plants of economic and decorative importance are damaged annually by various types of fungi. Because of the financial losses involved, a great deal of research has been done in a attempt to find methods and substances for the control of these deleterious fungi. Triadimefon is identified as l 4 chloro phenoxy 3,3 dimethyl l 112,4 triazol l yl butan 2 one. This compound and its salts with physiologically compatible acids are described and claimed in U.S. 3,912,752 October 14, 1975 , and is alleged to show considerably higher and broader plant fungicidal activity than n douecylguanidine acetate Dodine , which compound also has fungicidal action. Further in the prior art is U.S. 4,005,083 January 25, 1977 , which discloses and claims metal complexes of azolyl ethers, including triadimefon.These metal complexes also have plant fungicidal activity. Chlorothalonil, also named tetrachloroisophthalonitrile, and identified as 2,4,5,6tetrachloro 1,3 dicyanobenzene, is described in bothU.S. Patent No. 3,290,353 December 6, 1966 , and inU.S. Patent No. 3,331,735 July 18, 1967 , as being active as a plant fungicide. There has now been discovered a synergistic fungicidal composition containing as active ingredients appropriate amounts of each of triadimefon, or salts thereof, and chlorothalonil and a method for treating fungal infections of cultivated plants, especially cereals, using the composition. This invention relates to a method for controlling fungal infections of cultivated plants such as celery and squash, and especially cereals.Thus, this invention relates to a method of controlling the earls blight of celery caused byCercospora apii the powders mildew of squash caused by Erysiphe cichoracearum the downy mildew of squash caused by Pseudoperonospora cubensis the leafspot on sugar beet caused by Cecospora lbeticola. More particularly, this invention relates to a method of controlling fungal infections of cereals caused by plant pathogenic fungi selected from the group consisting of Septoria nozorwm, Puccinia recondita,Puccinia graminis tritica, and Puccinia glumarum. In particular this invention relates to a method of controlling to fungal infection of cereals caused byPuccinia recondita. The method of controlling fungal infections of cereals is carried out by applying to the foliage of the host plants a fungicidally effective amount of a composition comprising synergistic proportions of an active first ingredient triademefon, and salts thereof, and an active co ingredient, chlorothalonil, said synergistic proportions consisting of a ratio of from about 1 400 to about 1 2.5 parts by weight of active first ingredient to active co ingredient. In particular, the method of controlling the fungal infection of cereals caused by Puccinia recondita is accomplished by applying to the foliage of the host plants a fungicidally effective amount of a composition comprising synergistic proportions of an active first ingredient, triadimefon, or salts thereof, and an active co ingredient, chlorothalonil, said synergistic proportions consisting of a ratio of from about 1 20 to about 1 5 parts by weight of active first ingredient to active co ingredient. This invention also relates to novel fungicidal compositions comprising synergistic proportions of an active first ingredient triadimefon, or salts thereof, and an active co ingredient, chlorothalonil, said synergistic proportions consisting of a ratio of from about 1 400 to about 1 2.5 parts by weight of active first ingredient to active coingredient. In order to determine that the fungicidal effect obtained by combining triadimefon and chlorothalonil is synergistic, as compared to the control of the fungus accomplished by either of the two substances applied alone, the formula developed byS.R. Colby, Weeds 15, 20 22 1967 is used. As is well known to those working in the field of plant science, if the value obtained by use of the Colby equation is less than the actual control produced by application of the combination of triadimefon and chlorothalonil, then synergism is considered to have occurred between the two active ingredients in their effect on the fungi. In operating according to the method of the present invention, the fungi to be controlled are contacted by the antifungal combination according to the following general procedures. The antifungal combination is applied to infected or susceptible plant surfaces in any convenient fashion, such as spraying or dusting. A spray method is preferable, the novel combination being applied at any time after crop emergence up until harvest, the actual frequency and duration of treatment being determined by the severity of the actual or expected disease. In spraying, it is usually sufficient for the infected or susceptible surfaces to be thoroughly wet with the liquid dispersion employed. Good results have been obtained by employing spray compositions whether they be emulsions or aqueous dispersions of solid concentrates.The antifungal substances can also be used for treatment of seed as one embodiment of the antifungal method. The combinations used in the present invention can be applied as a tank mix, wherein the particular active ingredients are formulated separately and then combined in the tank for application.Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated as a combination ready to be diluted and applied. Or, if desired, the active ingredients can be formulated separately and applied at the same time, but separately, in successive applications. Thus, the practice of the instant novel method of controlling plant pathogenic fungi is considered to include application of as a first ingredient triadimefon, together with, as coingredient, chlorothalonil, as described above, as a preformulated fungicidal composition, as a tank mix, or by successive application of the individual active ingredients. In the practice of the novel fungicidal method in the greenhouse, the triadimefon is applied as a spray at the rate of from about 5 ppm. to about 20 ppm. active ingredient, nile chlorothalonil, the co ingredient, is also applied as a spray at the rate of from about 25 ppru. to about 100 ppm. active ingredient. Those skilled in the art of the use of chemicals for the control of plant pathogenic fungi readily understand that the application rates of the active ingredients generally are higher for field application. Thus, in the field the triadimefon ingredient is preferably applied in an amount of from about 0.0025 to about 0.099 kg. ha., whereas chlorothalonil, the co ingredient, is preferably applied in an amount of from about 0.25 to about 0.99 kg. ha. Thus, a preferred ratio of the triadimefon to the chlorothalonil is from about 1 400 to about 1 2.5, preferably from about 1 50 to about 1 2.5, most preferably from about 1 10 to about 1 2.5 parts by weight. The novel combination of the invention is preferably utilized in the form of a fungicidal formulation comprising the triadimefon and the chlorothalonil associated with a nonphytotoxic, inert carrier therefor. The fungicidal formulations of the invention may comprise from about 5 to about 90 by weight of active ingredients and will usually be in the form of a wettable powder or dust, or an aqueous suspension. The triadimefon and the chlorothalonil may be employed in the form of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, as the unformulated technical material, or in whatever other formulation iff which they are available, any of which forms of the active ingredients are then diluted, suspended, dissolved, or mixed with suitable additaments, in order to prepare the desired combination of the triadimefon first ingredient, and chlorothaloni 1 co ingredient for application to control the fungi. Wettable powders or dusts are comprised of an intimate mixture of 1 the active ingredients, 2 one or more inert carriers, and 3 appropriate surfactants. The inert carrier may be chosen from the attapulgite clays, the montmorillonite clays, the diatomaceous earths, kaolins, micas, talcs and purified silicates. Effective surfactants may be found among the sulfonated lignins, the naphthalene sulfonates and condensed naphthalene sulfonates, the alkyl succinates, the alkylbenzene sulfonates, the alkyl sulfates and nonionic surfactants such as ethylene oxide adducts of phenol. Aqueous suspensions are comprised of the active ingredients suspended in water together with any desired surfactants, thickening agents, antifreezing agents or preservatives. Suitable surfactants may be chosen from those mentioned above in connection with wettable powders. Thickening agents, if used, are normally chosen from appropriate cellulose materials and natural gums whilst glycols will generally be used when an anti freezing agent is required. Preservatives, if needed, may be chosen from a wide range of materials such as the various paraben antibacterials, phenol, 2 chloro 4 hydroxytoluene, phenyl mercuric nitrate and formaldehyde. The novel synergistic fungicidal compositions are then applied to plants in effective amounts, varying somewhat with the particular organism, with the severity of the infection, and with other factors such as the environment in which treatment is con dusted. The methods for the preparation of triadimefon and its salts with physiologically compatible acids are disclosed in Meiser et al., U.S. Patent No.3,912,752 October 14, 1975 . The methods of prep aration are thus well known and readily available in the prior art. The triadimefon may be formulated according to methods disclosed in Meiser et al., supra.Triadimefon is commercially available formulated as 5 and 256 active ingredient wettable powders as an emulsifiable concentrate of 100 g. active ingredient liter and as a dust 1 active ingredient. The co ingredient chlorothalonil, is prepared according to the disclosure of U.S. Patent No.3,290,353 Dec. 6, 1966 . Chlorothalonil is commercially available formulated as a 75 percent wetteDle powder 75 WP , or as a 6 lb. gal. flowable formulation 6 F . The synergistic effect of the combined application of triadimefon with chlorothalonil is demonstrated by the following tests conducted in the greenhouse.Test 1 The efficacy of combinations of triadimefon and chlorothalonil, for the control of wheat leaf rust Puccinia recondita was determined in the greenhouse, using concentrations of triadimefon 25WP of 5, 10 or 20 ppm. in combination with 25, 50 or 100 ppm. of chlorothalonil 75 wP . Triadimefon was also evaluated alone at 5, 10 or 20 ppm., and chlorothalonil was also evaluated alone at 25, 50, and 100 ppm. of active ingredient. The triadimefon used was formulated as a 25WP, and the chlorothalonil as a 75 WP. The treatment solutions were prepared by dilution of the triadimefon 25 WP or the chlorothalonil 75 WP with tap water to the necessary concentrations. Wneat plants of the variety Monon were grown in plastic pots, each pot containing approximately 50 wheat plants. Each treatment was sprayed on the plants in two plastic pots at the time the plants were seven days old, spraying continuing until runoff occurred. After drying, the plants were inoculated with spores of the wheat leaf rust fungus, and the pots and plants were placed in a moist chamber for about 40 hours and then moved to the greerhouse for detelopment of the disease. Two weeks after the plants were placed in the greenhouse, they were examined visually to determine the percent disease incidence and this figure was converted to percent disease control. The results appear in Table 1, which follows. Table 1 Percent Control of Wheat Leaf Rust Chlorothalonil 75 WP Treatments PPM 0 25 50 100 Triadimefon 0 0 36 64 57 25 ITP 5 0 36 50 89 10 14 36 68 89 20 14 64 79 93 The results of these experiments show the existence of a synergistic effect between triadimefon and chlorothalonil at various combinations of application rates.
