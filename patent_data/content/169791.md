# Music on hold for key systems and pabx systems.

## Abstract
A music on hold system is provided for key telephone systems having key stations 23a n , central office lines 24 , and a muting relay 18 for load resistance termination of the central office lines when they are on hold. A music source 12 provides a music signal which is applied to the muting relay. When the telephone system controller 16 receives a hold command from a key station, it generates a hold signal and applies the hold signal, the muting relay. In response to the hold signal, the muting relay applies the music signal to the central office line. Before being applied to the muting relay, the music signal is conditioned 14 by passage through a gain control, a high frequency cut off filter, an amplifier, and a DC level shifter.
