## Description
The present invention relates to fluorescent optical concentrator devices. Fluorescent optical concentrator devices are a series of devices which have the following common features. A fluorescent dye is dissolved in a host material, eg glass or plastics. Radiation incident on the host material, eg ambient light or light from an adjacent generator, is absorbed in the host material by the dye. Light is re emitted by the dye which, in terms of its intensity versus wavelength curve, is characteristic of the particular dye used. The re emitted light is subject to internal reflection within the host material at the surfaces of the host material. A light outlet is provided at a particular surface of the host material or a surface adjacent thereto, so that the internally reflected light re emitted by the dye is allowed to leave the host material primarily at the light outlet.Thus, radiation incident on the device is collected, re emitted as light and concentrated by the surfaces of the device to re emerge from a particular light outlet. Examples of applications of known fluorescent optical concentrator devices are as follows. 1 Fluorescent light activated displays FLADs Devices of this kind are described in USA patent specification numbers 4,142,781 and 4,111,534. The concentrator device is located behind a conventional light modulating display, eg a liquid crystal display. Ambient light is incident on the host material of the concentrator device via the light modulating display The light outlet of the concentrator device is in the form of a series of regions, eg the bars of an alphanumeric digit, provided on a surface of the concentrator device which is generally parallel to the operating electrodes of the light modulating display. These regions correspond in shape and position within the plane that they are contained to the shape and position of the electrodes. These regions comprise rough, eg specially scratched, portions which do not permit total internal reflection.Light from the concentrator device is re transmitted through the display. The concentrator device improves the observed contrast of the display.2 Planar solar collectors PSCs Devices of this kind are described for example in the following references i Applied Optics 15 2299 1976 W H Weber and J Lambe ii Optics Letters 1 73 1977 B A Swards, T Cole and A H Zewail iii Applied Physics 14 123 1977 A Goetzberger and W Greubel iv US Patent No 4,260,219. The host material is in the form of at least one planar rectangular plate. Ambient radiation incident on the or each plate is absorbed and re emitted by the dye and this re emitted light iS guided by internal reflection along the plate to an outlet surface where the light is coupled into a solar cell. This may be either at the edge of the plate or adjacent to a surface thereof. 3 Dye lasers In these the host material containing the dye is contained or flows between two facing mirror surfaces. The first of these two surfaces provides total internal reflection. The second provides almost but not total internal reflection. The host material is excited with radiation from an adjacent source.The radiation is absorbed by the dye and re emitted as light which is internally reflected between the mirror surfaces.This light eventually emerges through the second mirror surface which acts as the light outlet. The emergent light is coherent laser light because it consists of photons whose emission is stimulated by other photons from the dye molecules during the internal reflection process . Optionally, the light output may be controlled to be in the form of a series of pulses by controlling the reflection of the second mirror surface with a known Q switch. The fluorescent dyes which have previously been considered for use in fluorescent optical concentrator devices, eg rhodamines, are not ideal largely because of limited spectral absorption of ambient radiation particularly in the case of FILADS and PSCs and strong self absorption of the re emitted light. In US Patent No 4,260,219 a method of reducing selfabsorption is proposed which involves incorporating as a colloidal solution in a solid host material an amphiphilic additive to enclose fluorescent dye particles therein within a colloidal droplet of the additive. The additive is proposed to provide an orientation polarisation to enable a shift of the emission spectrum relative to the absorption spectrum of the dye to take place. The potential disadvantages of this method are that the introduction of the additive increases the cost of production, the additive dye concentration has to be carefully controlled and the method is only feasible with a very limited number of dyes. In fact no examples of suitable dyes are mentioned in the patent. It is an object of the invention to provide a fluorescent optical concentrator device incorporating a fluorescent dye having better absorption of ambient radiation particularly in the case of FLADs and PSCs and less self absorption than the dyes previously considered for use in fluorescent optical concentrator devices. According to the present invention an optical concentrator device includes a radiation receiving area, a radiation emitting area, two spaced reflecting surfaces and between the reflecting surfaces a host material incorporating within it a fluorescent dye, wherein the dye comprises a complex of the formulaML6Z, where M represents a metal selected from Ru Os II and Ir III L6 represents a plurality of ligands satisfying six valencies of M, at least one of which ligands is provided by a heterocyclic organic molecule containing at least one non metal atom capable of ligand bonding to the metal M, and Z represents one or more ions associated with Mull, Z being present when ML6 carries an overall ionic charge and absent when ML6 carries no overall ionic charge, Z having an overall ionic charge equal and opposite to the overall ionic charge of ML6. The ligands L in the Formula ML6Z may be mono ientate ligands or part of a poly dentate ligand structure which may contain the same or different ligands. Preferably, the said non metal is provided by a heterocyclic aromatic molecule. It is preferably nitrogen, although it may also be oxygen, sulphur or phosphorus. Preferably, at least two of the ligands L are contained in bidentate ligand structures, a single heterocyclic molecule,preferably aromatic, providing both of such ligands. Preferably one, desirably each, of the bonds to the metal M is provided by nitrogen. Preferably, at least four of the ligands L are provided by two heterocyclic molecules each containing at least two nitrogen atoms all four of the nitrogen atoms being ligand bonded to the metal M. Desirably the two heterocyclic molecules are identical aromatic molecules. Where M is Ru II or Os II all of the ligands L are preferably provided by bidentate structures containing nitrogen in an overall structure as shown in Formula Ia as follows EMI5.1 Formula Ia whereEMI5.2 represents a pair of the ligands formed by a single heterocyclic molecule which is a double nitrogen containing heterocyclic chelating agent. Preferably, at least two of the three heterocyclic molecules are identical and they are desirably aromatic. Where M is Ir III it is preferred that of the six ligandsL four are provided by heterocyclic molecules, which are preferably identical and aromatic, each of which is a double nitrogen containing heterocyclic chelating agent and two are provided by halogens eg Cl. The complex structure may be in a cis configtfra tion in this form. In any of the above classes of complex where one or more pairs of the ligands L in the formula ML6Z are contained in bidentate ligand structures they may be provided by a chelating agent which is 2,2 bipyridyl or a derivative thereof containing one or more substituents in the bipyridyl ring structure or by a chelating agent which is 1,10 phenanthroline or a derivative thereof containing one or more substituents in the phenanthroline ring structure. Substituents may themselves be formed in a separate bridging or ring structure, eg they may be in a separate aromatic ring fused to the basic structure, eg such as in a naphthyl or biquinoline structure, formed with one or more of the rings of the bipyridyl or phenanthroline structure. Thus, if one or more pairs of the ligands L are formed from a 2,2 bipyridyl structure, the 2,2 bipyridyl structure may contain hydrogen in the 3,4,5,6,3 ,4 ,5 and 6 positions or a substituent group in or attached to any one or more of these positions. Preferably, where two or more substituent groups are included in the 2,2 bipyridyl structure these are identical groups. Likewise, if one or more pairs of the ligands L are formed from a 1 ,10 phenanthroline structure, the 1,10 phenanthroline structure may contain hydrogen in the 2 3q4q5t6q7q8 and 9 positions or a substituent group in or attached to any one or more of these positions Preferably if two or more substituent groups are included in the 1,10 phenanthroline structure these are identical groups Preferablyt where one or more substituents are contained in a 2,2 bipyridyl structure or a 1,10 phenanthroline structure they are aryl groups, preferably monocyclic aryl. Particular mention should be made of complexes of FormulaML6Z which contain at least two pairs of the ligands L, each pair provided by a k14 disubstituted 2,2 bipyridyl of Formula II as follows EMI6.1 where each Q is a monocyclic aryl group preferably phenyl or substituted phenyl. These complexes are dyes showing a particularly high quantum efficiency. Particular mention should also be made of complexes ofFormula ML6Z which contain at least two pairs of the ligands L, each pair of the ligands being provided by a 4,7 disubstituted 1,10 phenanthroline of Formula III as follows EMI7.1 where Q is a monocyclic aryl group preferably phenyl or substituted phenyl. These complexes are dyes showing a particularly high quantum efficiency. One or more of the ligands L included in L6 may carry a negative charge affecting the overall charge of ML6. For example, one or more of the ligands L may be halogens or ionic organic groups such as COO . Where the total negative charge provided by such ligands is equal to the total positive charge provided by the metal M no additional neutralising ion Z is required.However, where ML6 is a cation, whether or not ionic groups are included in L61 one or more ions Z are required to form a neutral compound. For example, where M is Ru II or Os II and the six ligandsL6 are provided by three heterocyclic organic molecules each ligandbonded at two of its non metal atoms to the metal M, eg by a 2,2 bipyridyl or a 1,10 phenanthroline structure, the overall charge of ML6 is 2. In other words, the ligands L do not contribute to the overall charge of L6. One or more additional anions Z providing a charge of 2, eg two anions having a single negative charge, are required to provide a neutral compound. Where M is Ir III for example, and four of the ligands L are provided by two heterocyclic organic molecules each ligand bonded to the metal M at two non metal atoms in the heterocyclic molecule, eg in a 2,2 bipyridyl or a 1,10 phenanthroline structure, and the other two ligands are provided by halogens, the overall charge on ML6 is 1. The additional anion Z having a single negative charge is required to provide a neutral compound in this case. Preferably, where an anion Z is present it is a halogen,egCl. Preferably where two or more anions Z are present they are identical and are both halogens, although they may also beC104 or other anions. Preferably, free oxygen is removed from the dye and host material used in the optical concentrator device according to the present invention before incorporation therein. For example, where the dye is in a liquid solution the solution is deaerated and where the dye is to be contained in plastic the plastic is dearated before setting. The dyes formed from complexes of Formula ML6Z may be mixed with other fluorescent dyes, eg with other dyes of Formula ML6Z and or with known dyes, eg rhodamines, to give a better overall dye excitation spectrum, as explained in detail below, before incorporation in the device according to the present invention. The optical concentrator device according to the present invention may, for example, be a fluorescent light activated display, a solar collector device or a dye laser constructed in a known manner as described above, or any one of the other devices of this kind mentioned in US Patent No 4,260,219. The host material is chosen according to the particular application, but may, for example, be a solid, eg a plastics material such as polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl chloride or polymethyl methacrylate. Alternatively, the host material may be a liquid. For example it may be an organic solvent eg ethanediol.The liquid may be held in or passed through transparent container eg a cell containing glass or transparent windows. If the liquid is held in the container, the container may include means permitting the liquid to be replaced from time to time. A solid host material particularly a plastics material will normally be used in a solar collector device and in a fluorescent light activated display whilst a liquid host material will normally be used in a dye laser. For instance, a solar collector device may comprise a film of plastics material having uniformly distributed in it a dye comprising a complex of the Formula ML6Z and at least one solar cell located adjacent to a surface of the film to receive radiation absorbed and re emitted by the dye and internally reflected and hence concentrated by the film. In this case the radiation receiving and emitting areas are provided by surfaces of the film, the former being a free area of the film and the latter an area adjacent to a solar cell. Where the device is a fluorescent light activated display it may comprise an electro optical light modulating device and a layer of the host material containing the dye comprising a complex of Formula ML6Z positioned behind the light modulating device, the radiation receiving and emitting areas being provided by surfaces of the host material. In this case the radiation emitting area comprises one or more regions of decreased internal reflectivity formed on a surface of the host material to correspond with information displayed by the light modulating device. Where the device is a dye laser it may comprise plane facing mirror surfaces at least one of which is partially internally reflecting and provides said radiation emitting area, a container containing a liquid laser active medium between said mirror surfaces, the container being transparent and providing said radiation receiving area, and means for irradiating the laser active medium to cause stimulated emission of radiation by said liquid laser active medium between said mirror surfaces, wherein the liquid laser active medium comprises a liquid host containing a dye comprising a complex of Formula ML6Z as specified above. According to the invention in another aspect a composition suitable for use in any one of the devices specified above which utilise a solid host material comprises a plastics high polymeric material incorporating, preferably having uniformly distributed in it, a fluorescent dye comprising a complex of the formula ML6Z specified above. Preferably free oxygen has been removed from the materials forming the said composition. The plastics material may be polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate or polymethylmethacrylate. Where M is Ru II or Qs Il the concentration of the complex in the plastics material is preferably between 5x1O 3 and desirably between 9x1O and 2.2x10 moles per mole of the solid plastics material Where M is Ir III the concentration of the complex in the plastics material by weight is between 1 part of the complex in 500 parts of the plastics material and 1 part of the complex in 10,000 parts of the plastics material, desirably about 1 part in 2,000 According to the present invention in another aspect there is provided a film of the composition as specified above.Preferably, the film has a thickness in the range 0.5 to 10 mm, desirably in the range 1 to 5 mm. Where the film is for use particularly in a solar collector device it preferably has a thickness as specified above and is specially fabricated with a large area, eg greater than 10 2 square metres, desirably greater than 1 square metre. According to the present invention in another aspect there is provided a novel complex of formula ML6Z suitable for use in the optical concentrator device specified above which complex may be 1 1 2 3 2 1 represented by the formula Y Y Y Z , where M is selected fromRu II and Os II , Zê represents one or two anions having an overall negative charge of 2, and each of y1 y2 and Y3 is independently selected from a structure containing a 2,2 bipyridyl nucleus or a structure containing a 1,10 phenanthroline nucleus, at least one ofY1, y2 and Y3 carrying at least one substituent in the 2,2 bipyridyl or 1,10 phenanthroline nucleus provided that the substituent is other 1 2 than deuterium and that where yl Y and Y3 are identical and are 2,21 bipyridyl structures the substituent if in the 4,4 positions is other than methyl and phenyl and if in the 5,5 positions is other than COOH, methyl, and COOR, where R is simple alkyl, and that where Y1, Y2 and Y3 are identical and are 1,10 phenantroline structures the substituent if in the 5 position is other than nitro, chloro, phenyl and methyl, if in the 4,7 positions is other than phenyl and methyl and if in the 5,6 positions is other than methyl and oxygen. Preferably, two or three of Y1, Y2 and Y3 are identical. Preferably, the substituted structure contains substituents in the 4,4 positions where the structure is a 2,2 bipyridyl and in the 417 positions where the structure is a 1,10 phenathroline. The substituents may themselves form a separate bridging group or ring structure, eg fused to one of the rings of the bipyridyl or phenathroline structure. Examples of suitable substituents subject to the proviso specified above are halogens eg Cl nitro C1 12 alkyl C1 12 alkoxy phenyl substituted phenyl eg alkyl or alkoxy or halo substituted phenyl, eg p substituted CH CH H5,OPh1 OCH2Ph CH2Ph or CH2Ph where P phenyl, NH2 NR1R2 where R1 and R2 are simple C1 to C5 alkyl NHCOR3,R3 alkyl CH CHC H J where J is 6 4 a para substituent such as phenyl, nitro, amino, halo, alkyl or alkoxy CONHNH21 CONHNHR3 CON3 COOP3, tolyl biphenyl. naphthyl, pyridyl, thienyl. also According to the present invention there isbprovided a novel A complex of the formula ML6Z suitable for use in the optical concentrator device specified above which complex may be represented by the formula M2Y4Y5W1W2Z3, where M2 is Ir III , Z3 represents an anion group, WI and W2 are halogens and each of and Y5 is independently selected from an optionally substituted structure containing a 2,2 bipyridyl or a 1,10 phenanthroline nucleus. 4 nucleus.5 1 Preferably Y and Y are identical and W and W2 are identical eg both are Cl. Preferably, Z3 is a halogen eg I. Preferably Y4 and Y5 if 2,2 bipyridyl and if substituted are substituted in the 4,4 positions and if 1,10 phenanthroline are substituted in the 4.7 positions. Substituents, if present may themselves form a separate bridging or ring structure, eg a ring fused to one of the rings of the bipyridyl or phenanthroline structure. Generally speaking, dyes of Formula ML6Z show improved absorption of ambient light and reduced self absorption compared with known dyes used in optical concentrator devices.It is believed that these advantages are obtained for the following reasons. a. The absorption spectrum of the complexes of Formula ML6Z includes both the ligand absorption bands and an allowed metal 8Sligand charge transfer transition which lies to lower energy. This combination of absorption bands gives a wider spectral absorption range to the complex ion. b. The luminescence of the complexes of Formula ML6Z is assigned as a spin forbidden triplet singlet component of the charge transfer transition. The corresponding absorption transition is weak, since it is also spin forbidden. There is therefore a spectral region of low absorption between the luminescence band and the onset of strong charge transfer absorption. This reduces the self absorption of luminescence in use in the optical concentrator device according to the present invention which depends on the reflection of luminescent radiation over relatively long path lengths. For these reasons special additives to the dye as proposed in US Patent No 4,260,219 are not required. Complexes having Formula ML Z may be prepared by 6 known synthetic procedures. Some of these complexes are, in fact, known per se but these known complexes have never been suggested for use in optical concentrator devices as defined above.

II PREPARATION OF THE COMPLEXES FROM THE LIGANDS 1. Ru II complexes were prepared by one of four methods as follows, which are known per se i refluxing 3 equivalents of the heteromolecule providing 2 ligands with 1 equivalent of RuCl3 in 95 ethanol for about 3 days or ii refluxing 3 equivalents of the heteromolecule with 1 equivalent of K2RuCl5.H2O in aqueous dimethylformamide in the presence of a reducing agent or iii heating 3 equivalents of the heteromolecule with 1 equivalent of K2PuCl5.H2O in glycerol at 2200 C for 1 hour iv Complexes of the form Pu II HHH Z Z where H and H1 are heterocyclic molecules providing bidentate ligands, eg 2,2 bipyridyls, H Hg, and Z is a halogen, were prepared by reacting a bis complex of the form Pu II HZAZA with a stoichiometric amount of H1 in ethanolic solution heated under reflux. In all cases the complexes were precipitated from solution by addition of appropriate acids or salts. 2. Os II complexes were prepared by methods which are known using NH or K salts of OsBr6 or OsC16 under conditions 4 similar to those used for the production of the Ru Il, complexes. 3. Cis dichlorobis complexes of Ir III , Ir III cisCl2L1 1 4 where L 4 represents 4 ligands provided by 2 heterocyclic molecules, and Z is an defined above, were prepared by heating two equivalents of a ligand providing heteromolecule with one equivalent of KDIrC16 in glycerol at 190 200 for 1 to 3 hours, with stirring. The complexes were precipitated from solution by addition of appropriate acids or salts1 eg iodides. The following preparative example illustrates the preparation in Steps i and ii of one of the above ligand providing heteromolecules compound No. 14ab and its subsequent conversion in Step iii into a complex Complex No. C79 .Preparative example Preparation of Ru 4,7 di 3 4 dimethylphenyl phen 3 Cl2 Step i Preparation of 3 chloro 3 4 dimethylpropiophenone I known compound This compound of Formula was preparedEMI20.1 Formula A the method descibed by P. Olavi, I Viftanen and Heikki Puotsalainen in Annales Academiae Scientiarum Fennicae Series A II Chemica 143 1968 from o xylene. The m.p. of the compound was found to be 700C.Step ii Preparation of 4 ,7 di 3141 dimethylphenyl Phen 11 This compound has the formula EMI20.2 Concentrated HC1 200 ml was heated up to 80 100 and to this was added o phenylenediamine 7.29 g . When all the diamine has dissolved the product of Step i 29.16 g was quickly added and the mixture was then stored at 90 100 for 4 hours. It was then cooled to room temperature and left to stand overnight. The resulting precipitate was filtered off and washed with dichloromethane until the washings were colourless. The pale yellow needle crystals of B HCl where B is the required heteromolecule were treated with aqueous ammonia and dichloromethane.The organic layer was separated, washed until neutral and evaporated to give the free ligand providing heteromolecule B.Trituration with petroleum ether and drying at 1100 20 mm gave the product as a white solid, 5.2 g 20 m.p. 1920. The analytical results for the product were C, 86.57 H, 6.22 N, 7.18 C28H24N2 . The corresponding figures required by theory are C, 86.55 H, 6.24 N, 7.21 .

Ethanol 150 ml was then removed under reduced pressure. Hydrochloric acid 6N, 70 ml was added to the residual solution. The orange precipitate was filtered off and washed well with cold water and dried 1000 20 mm 0.9 g, 98 .The analytical results for the product were C, 70.70 H, 5.73 N, 5.31 Cl,4.34. C84 2N6 Cl2.3.3 H20The corresponding figures required by theory are C, 70.22 H, 5.83 N, 5.85 Cl, 4.93 . III INCORPORATION INTO FILMS The Ru II and Ops 11 complexes prepared as described above were incorporated into low molecular weight polymer films as follows. To viscous solutions of plastics polyvinyl acetate in ethanol, polymethylmethacrylate in chloroform, polyvinyl chloride in cblorobenzene was added with stirring the complex dissolved in the corresponding solvent except for addition to polyvinylchloride where a solvent such as acetone or acetonitrile was used . The resultant homogeneous solutions were contained in moulds and the solvent evaporated in air over several days. The concentration of the complex in the film was between 9 x 10 and 2.2 x 10 5 moles per mole of the solid plastics material, generally I x 10 2 moles per mole of the solid plastics material. Ir III complexes were incorporated into polyvinyl chloride PVC films by heating PVC pellets together with the appropriate complex. The quantities used were 1 mg of complex per 2 g of pellets. IV ABSORPTION AND EMISSION SPECTRA The absorption spectrum and the emission spectrum were measured for two complexes of Formula ML6Z Ru 2,2 bipyridyl 3C12 and Os 2,2 bipyridyl 3I2 and the results obtained are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 respectively. A is the absorption spectrum and E the emission spectrum in each ease. As can be seen there is a very small overlap between the spectra A and E in each case. Figures 1 and 2 should be contrasted with the corresponding spectra A and E for the known dye rhodamine B, which as shown in Figure 3, show a much greater degree of overlap. V QUANTUM EFFICIENCY QE MEASUREMENTS 1. Relative QE measurements of liquid solutions of the complexes were measured by comparison of the emission intensity of the sample with that of a standard solution of rhodamine B. The sample and standard were excited at the same wavelength and absorbance, selected between 360 and 540 nm and the emission recorded at 90 to the exciting beam by a monochromator photomultiplier combination detector. The detection system was calibrated for spectral response using a Hilger Watts thermopile to allow emission spectra to be corrected and plotted as relative numbers of photons emitted versus wavelength. The area under such a curve is proportional to the number of photons emitted. Rhodamine B is taken to have the QE in absolute terms of 0.73, as determined by previous work.2. Relative QE measurements of the complexes in thin plastic films, about 1 mm thick, formed as in III above were determined by observing the emitted light at an angle of 1800 to the exciting beam. This avoids erroneously high values being given by total internal reflection within the thin film.3. Liquid solutions of the complexes were depleted of free oxygen by degassing in an optical cell fitted with a side arm in the following way. The solution was frozen to 77K in the wide arm and the gas above the solid solution was pumped away to a pressure of 10 5 mm Hg. The solution was allowed to warm to room temperature under vacuum so that it outgassed into the vacuum space. This freeze pump thaw cycle was repeated twice. Relative QE measurements for the degassed solutions obtained in this say were then measured as described under 1 above. The complexes investigated are listed below in Table 10 and results obtained are listed in Tables 11, 12, 15 and 14 which follow where the following symbols are used bipyr 2,2 bipyridyl phen 1,10 phenanthroline bipyr d deuterated 2,21 bipyridyl Ph phenyl Me methyl Et ethyl D deuterium SPA dimethyl ether 3 methylpentane ethyl alcohol, in a ratio of 5 3 2 parts by volume QE quantum efficiency DMSO dimethylsul oxide DMF dimethylformamide PVA polyvinyl acetate PVC polyvinyl chloride PMMA polymethyl methacrylate St styryl TABLE 10 List of complexesLigand No. ComDlex No.Complex 1 Cl Ru bipyr 3C12 4b C2 Ru 4,4 diClbipyr 3C12 4c C3 Ru 4,4 diBrbipyr 3I2 4v C4 Ru 4, 4 diCO2Et bipyr 3Cl2 5v C5 Ru 5,5 diCO2Etbipyr 3I2 5n C6 Ru 5,5 diMebipyr 3C12 4n C7 Ru 4,4 diMebipyr 3Cl2 4g C8 Ru 4,4 diOEtbipyr 3I2 4d C9 Ru 4,4 diOphbipyr 3Cl2 4w C10 Ru 4,4 diCH2Phbipyr 3I2 4e C11 Ru 4,4 diOCH2Phbipyr 3Cl2 40 C12 Ru 4,4 1i tbipyr 3Cl2 4m C13 Ru 4,4 diPhbipyr 3Cl2 1 2 4m C14 Ru bipyr 1 4,4 diPhbipyr 2I2 2 1 4m C15 Ru bipyr 2 4,4 diPhbipyr 1I2 2 4m 14y C16 Ru 4,4 diPhbipyr 2 4,7 di ss 12 4k C17 Ru 4,4 diNEt2bipyr 12 4i C18 41 C19 Ru 4s48 JHCoCX3biPYr 3I2 51 C20 Ru 515 diNHCOCH3bipyr 312 TABLE 10 List of complexes Continued Ligand No. Complex No. Complex 4a C21 Rti 4,4 diN02bipyr 3BF4 3b C22 Ru 4 Clbipyr 3I2, 3c C23 RU 4 Brbipyr 3I2 3f C24 Ru 4 OMebipyr 3I2 32 3a C25 Ru 4 N02bipyr 3I2 3e C26 Ru 4 OCH2Phbipyr 3I2 3i C27 Ru 4 NH2bipyr 3I2 3j C28 Ru 4 NMe2biPYr 3I2 11 C29 Ru phen 3I2 12n C30 RU 4 Mephen 3I2 13n C31 mi 5 Mephen 3012 13b 032 Ra 5 clphen 3Cl2 12d C33 Ru 4 OPhphen 3Cl2 12m 034 Ra 4 Phphen 3C12 12q C35 Ru 4 tolylphen 3cl2 12t C36 Ru 4 biphenylphen 3C12 12s C37 Ru 4 bromophenylphen 3012 12b C38 Ru 4 Clphen 3I2 12r C39 Ru 4 OMephphen 3Cl2 13n RTI ID 26.9 C40 Ru 5 Phphen 3I2 TABLE 10 List of complexes Continued Ligand No Complex No Complex 13a C41 Ru 5 NO2phen 3 ClO4 2 14n C42 Ru 4,7 diMephen 3Cl2 14m C43 Ru 4,7 diPhphen 3I2 14s C44 Ru 4,7 diBrpliphen 3Cl2 14q C45 Ru 4, 7 ditolylphen 3Cl2 14b C46 Ru 4,7 diClphen 3I2 17 C47 Ru 5,6 diMephen 312 19 C48 Rh 3,4,7,8 tetraMephen 3C12 15mt C49 Ru 4 PhPh,7 Phphen 3Cl2 15rs C50 Ru 4 BrPh,7 Me0Phphen 3Cl2 15rt C51 Ru 4 PhPh,7 MeOphphen 3Cl2 15st C52 Ru 4 PhFh,7 ErPhphen 3Cl2 1 C53 Os bipyr 3I2 5n C54 Os 5,5 diMebipyr 3I2 4m C55 Os 4,4 diPhbipyr 3I2 11 C57 Os phen 3I2 14m C58 0s 4,7 diPhphen 312 C59 Ru bipyr d8 3Cl2 C60 Ru 4,7 diPhPhphen 3Cl2 C56 Os 4,4 diC02Etbipyr 3I2 14ab C79 Ru 4,7 3 ,4 dimethylphenyl phen 3Cl2. 28TABLE 11 Absorption and luminescence properties of tris chelates of Ru II and Os II as listed in Table 10 All measurements at room temperature with the complex contained in an EtOX MeOH solution.

Table 11 illustrates that deaerating of the solutions of dye complexes of Formula ML6Z leads to higher quantum efficiencies. It also illustrates the large gap between the absorption maximum and the emission maximum. Table 12 illustrates that relatively high QE values can be obtained in plastic sheets for dye compounds of FormulaML6Z which have, in solution, lower QE values. Table 13 illustrates the solvent dependence of QE values for selected compounds. Table 14 illustrates that dye compounds of FormulaML6Z where M Ir have relatively high QE values when embedded in plastic sheets. VI MIXTURES OF THE Ru AND Os COMPLEXES WITH ORGANIC DYES It was pointed out above that the absorption process inverse to the luminescence of the Ru and Os complexes ofFormula ML6Z is relatively weak because of its spin forbidden singlet triplet character. This is particularly true for the Ru compounds, but less so for the Os complexes where the stronger spin orbit coupling breaks the spin selection rule. As noted previously this weak absorption is advantageous in reducing self absorption of the emitted light. However, as a consequence, relatively high concentrations of each complex may be required to achieve useful absorbance in the spectral region immediately to high energy of the luminescence band.Such high concentrations of the active complex can introduce non radiative concentration quenching of the QE. This effect presents a problem particularly in the case of Ru complexes, but it may be overcome by using the complexes in mixtures with other dyes, eg a conventional organic dye. Mixtures of Ru 4,7 diphenylphen 3I2 where phen 1,10phenanthroline together with known dyes rhodamine 6G and rhodamine B have been investigated in ethanediol. At useful concentration levels there is little interaction between the components of the mixture, so that the absorption and emission properties of the mixture are essentially the sum of the two separate components at the same concentration. This effect is illustrated by the luminescence excitation spectra of the Ru 4,7 diphenylpnen 3I Rhodamine B system as shown in Figure 4.The ruthenium complex has an excitation spectrum detected relative quantum efficiency v wavelength labelled 1 inFigure 4 whilst rhodamine B has an excitation spectrum labelled 2 in Figure 4. A mixture of these dyes was made with a concentration adjusted to give the same absorbance at the maximum of the absorption spectrum. Only a low rhodamine concentration was required to fill the spectral gap so the self absorption for this component was minimised. The mixture has an emission spectrum labelled 3 in Figure 4. Thus, the mixture gives an emission spectrum better than for the individual dyes because the minimum quantum efficiency is raised giving a more uniform excitation spectrum throughout the region 400 600 nm. The two dye components absorb strongly in different spectral regions, but have rather similar emission spectra in the orange region.The mixture therefore provides the widest possible spectral absorption, but minimi es self absorption problems. Dye mixtures incorporating only conventional organic dyes ie not complexes of Formula ML6Z are likely to be less efficient since each component absorbs and emits in a relatively narrow spectral range. The operation of such mixtures therefore generally requires complex energy transfer processes from the higher energy dye components to the lowest energy, which then emits. Examples of devices, which are known per se, in which the dyes of FormulaML6t may be used will now be described. As shown in Figure 5 a conventional liquid crystal display cell 11 constructed in a known way comprises a film 13 of liquid crystal material contained between glass slides 15. The film 13 is sealed in a conventional way between the slides 15 by a plastic spacer which, for the sake of clarity, is not shown in Figure 5 .The slides 15 have transparent electrodes 17 eg of tin oxide, on their respective inner surfaces which electrodes 17 have previously been photoetched in the shape of one or more characters or parts thereof the character s or parts thereof on one slide 15 matching these on the other slide 15. When a voltage from a source not shown in Figure 5 external to the cell 11 is applied between the electrodes 17 on the respective slides is by way of transparent conducting strips not shown on the inner surfaces of the slides 15 , ie across the film 13 the molecular arrangement within the film 13 between those electrodes 17 is changed by a known liquid crystal electro optical effect which depends on the liquid crystal material used and the initial alignment if any of the material relative to the inner surfaces of the slides 13 .This is the ON state which is different from the molecular arrangement in those parts of the film 13 not between the electrodes 17 which are in the OFF state. An optical contrast is observed between the ON and OFF states of the cell 11 which allows the or each character represented by the electrodes 17 between which the voltage is applied to be displayed. This is illustrated in Figure 5 by display of the letter A. Polarisers not shown in Figure 5 aligned in a known way may depending on the liquid crystal electro optical effect be positioned in front of the front slide 13 and behind the rear slide 13 in the cell ii to enhance the display contrast. A plate 19 of plastic material, eg polymethylmethacrylate, is positioned behind the rear slide 13 and behind any polariser located behind that slide . The plate 19 has dissolved in it one of the specific dye compounds of Formula ML6Z which are mentioned above, or a mixture of dyes which includes at least one compound of Formula MIZ. All of the surfaces of the plate 19 are polished plane surfaces except in a region 21 on the front surface of the plate 19 where the plate 19 has a roughened surface. The region 21 is located behind and matches the shape of the electrodes 17 in the cell 11. The edges of the region 21 may slightly overlap the corresponding edges of the electrodes 17. When ambient light transmitted through the cell 11 reaches the plate 19 it is absorbed by the dye in the plate 19. The dye re emits its own fluorescent light which is internally reflected many times within the plate 19. Eventually this light leaves the plate 19 at the region 21 which acts as a light outlet for the plate 19. The light is transmitted through the cell 11. If the plate 19 is observed through the cell 11 the character s represented by the energised electrodes 17 appear bright by the fluorescence obtained from the plate 19. This known effect is further described, using conventional fluorescent dyes, in US Patent No 4,142,781. The region 21 could be replaced in an alternative device construction by a uniform rough area behind the liquid crystal cell which only becomes visible when the cell is switched. Figure 6 shows a planar solar collector construction.Three plates 31, 32 and 33 have rectangular sides and ends and are mutually positioned so that the plate 32 is on top of the plate 33 and the plate 31 is on top of the plate 31. All three of the plates 31, 32, 33 are of plastic material, eg polymethylmethacrylate having one of the dyes of Formula ML6Z dissolved in it either alone or together with one or more other dyes. A different dye is dissolved in each of the plates 31, 32, 33 in order to enhance the overall dye absorption spectrum. One end of each of the plates 31, 32, 33 is silvered to give mirror surfaces 34, 35, 36 respectively, whilst adjacent to the other ends of the plates are located solar cells 37, 38 and 39, respectively. When ambient radiation falls on the construction from above as illustrated by a ray 41 in Figure 6 part of the spectrum of the radiation is absorbed by the plate 31. The unabsorbed parts of the spectrum are transmitted to the plate 32 where a further part is absorbed by the plate 32. Finally, parts of the spectrum absorbed by neither the plate 31 nor the plate 32 are transmitted to the plate 33 where further absorption occurs. The dye in each plate 31, 32 or 33 re emits radiation by fluorescence. This re emitted radiation is guided along the plate 31, 32 or 33 as appropriate to the end having the solar cell 371 38 or 39 in which it is absorbed. This is illustrated by rays 42, 43 and 44 guided along the plates 31, 32 and 33 respectively. Re emitted radiation directed initially away from the solar cells 37, 38 and 39 is reflected by the appropriate mirror surface 34, 35 or 36. This is illustrated by a ray 45 in the plate 31. In an alternative device one or two plates may be used, instead of the three shown in Figure 6, provided that a widely absorbing dye, eg a dye mixture as mentioned above, is used. In a further alternative device a plastics sheet, eg about I mm thick PVC having an area typically 1 m has attached to its lower face a series of solar cells, the solar cells ocupying about 50 75 of the surface area of the lower face. Dye laser constructions are well known, for example seeUS Patent No 4 271,395. Dyes of Formula ML6Z may be used in such known constructions in place of, or together with, dyes known for use in such devices. For example in the known construction shown in Figure 7 a thin walled quartz container 51 has an inlet port 53 and an outlet port 55 via which a liquid containing the dye comprising a complex of the formula ML6Z is continuously pumped. The liquid may be water or a simple organic compound such as ethanol. The molar concentration of the dye in the liquid is about 1 mole per litre of liquid. Light from a nitrogen laser 57 is focussed onto the liquid in the container 51 by a lens 58 causing stimulated emission by the dye therein. Broad band re emission in the form of laser light 60 is provided by multiple reflections between the resonator formed by a fully reflecting mirror 59 and a partially reflecting mirror 61 outside the container.
