# NEW DISTILLATION AND RECTIFICATION PROCESS OF ALCOHOLS AND APPARATUS FOR ITS PERFORMANCE

## Abstract
This invention is referred to an alcohol distillation and rec tification process, for which an apparatus formed by three in torconnected and superposed recipients is used, being the lower one a rectification dispositive provided with an ensemble of communicant vases to use up the product to be distilled, and in whose interior steam at high temperature is being in jected. in order to arrive the boiling point of the product to be distilled, which passes through the second recipient placed in an intermediate location and superposed to the first one, and endowed with a series of concentration plattes, from which, when the product overflows, it passes through a tubular ele ment toward the rectification recipient, and the produced steams, which carry the highest alcohol concentration, pass to a third recipient, that is located at the top, so that the heaviest alcohols are being purged from this second recipient. With this process alcohols in very high concentration, as well as with minimum impurities and at a very low cost are be ing attained.
