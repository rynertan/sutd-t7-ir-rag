# Apparatus for monitoring tool life.

## Abstract
A system for monitoring the vibration of a power driven cutting tool during machining first produces a signal propor tional to the vibration spectrum of the tool over a prese lected band width. This is passed through a digitally con trolled attenuator which is adjusted to provide an output sig nal at a preselected level. The degree of attenuation is stored, as is a reference value which is generated as a func tion of the attenuated signal. Then, during subsequent ma chining operations under the same machining conditions the attenuator is controlled to provide the same degree of attenuation and the reference value, which is in the form of a digital signal, is compared with the rectified and digitised output of the attenuator. When the latter exceeds the refer ence value a control signal is generated which either pro vides an audible or visual warning that the cutting tool is worn and therefore due for replacement or initiates an auto matic tool changing operation. The system effectively mon itors the wear of the tool and, in providing its own reference, i.e. the reference value which is generated, caters automat ically for changes in the machining conditions such as use of a different tool or change in workpiece material.
