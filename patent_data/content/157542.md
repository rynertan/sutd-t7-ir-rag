# ELECTRICAL CONNECTORS

## Abstract
A quick release electrical connector comprises a plug part 101 and a socket part 100 . A coupling sleeve 103 is mounted on the plug part 101 and is rotatable about the longi tudinal axis of the connector. The coupling sleeve 103 is op erative for screwing the plug part 101 and the socket part 100 together. A thrust washer 112 is disposed between the coupling sleeve and the plug part 101 and is provided with a ratchet means operative to permit rotation of the coupling sleeve 103 in one direction with a lower torque than that re quired to effect rotation of the coupling sleeve in the opposite direction. The thrust washer 112 therefore serves to prevent or at least reduce the possibility that the plug and socket parts may become inadvertently disconnected when subjected to vibration.
