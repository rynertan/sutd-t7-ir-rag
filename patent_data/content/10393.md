# A method for the non agricultural production of cacao cotyledons and a food product obtained by this method.

## Abstract
This invention is a non agricultural method for producing cotyledons of those plant species whose cotyledons have commercial value for the manufacture of useful products or for direct use as foodstuffs such as Theobroma cacao L. cacao . The method involves three 3 distinct steps, namely, 1 proliferation of cotyledonary embryos by asexual embryogenesis through in vitro culture using a defined media 2 the growth of the embryo in vitro in a media that will prevent premature germination, and 3 harvest of the in vitro grown cotyledon.
