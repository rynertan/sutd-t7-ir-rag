# Process for preparing a fibril reinforced polyolefin film and olefin polymer film so prepared.

## Abstract
A fibril reinforced olefin polymer is made of a web of randomly dispersed olefin polymer fibrils which are heated under an applied pressure to form a fused poly mer film having a small percentage of unmelted fibrils therein. The film has a higher tensile strength than a sol vent cast film prepared from the same olefin polymer.

## Description
jyibri l x tn o Cc clc Ã¬rr,oi .er I In Olefin polymer films, particularly ethylene polymer films, are used in commerce in large volume. By reXsolJ O their volume usage, the art is continuously seeking 1 olefin polymer films having improved properties and 2 more economical processes for the manufacture of olefin polymer films. According to this invention there is provided a process for preparing a fibril reinforced polyolefin comprising a forming a web of randomly dispersed olefin polymer fibrils, b heating the web to a temperature at which said fibrils melt, c subjecting the web to pressure throughout step b so as to form a compressed melted film, and d cooling the compressed melted film of step c to form a self supporting film the olefin polymer included in said fibrils having a weight average molecular weight of at least one million the duration of heating step b being such that a portion of the fibrils are incompletely melted and retain their fibril identity in the fused olefin polymer film. Preferably the web is laid down from an aqueous dis persion of the olefin polymer fibrils and the web is melted by being passed through heated calender rolls. The olefin polymer may be a polymer of ethylene or propylene. The olefin polymer fibrils employed in the practice of the invention constitute a recognized class of materials knows and described in the at. Such fibrils are prepared by precipitating an olefin polymer from an organic solvent solutiofl thereof under conditions of high shear.Representative U.S. patents diselasing the preparation of such fibrils include the ol OVj f U.S. 2,933.782 U.S. 3,031,519 U.S. 3,341,242 U.S. 3,740,333 U.S. 3,743,272 U.S. 3,306,091 U.S. 3,335,014 U.S. 3,891.499 U.S. 4,010,229 U.S. 4,013,751 When examined with the nakcd eye, tho ol ef in polymer fibrils employed in the invention resemble In appearance natural fibres such as cotton and. staple fibres of solution spun polymers such as nylon and the like. RTI ID 2.16 When examined microscopically, however, fibrils have grossly irregular shapes, including segments which appear to l e film like in nature. See for example Fig. 4 of U.S. 3,391,499. It s believed possible that these particular physical character istics may play a role in the function of the olefin polymer fibrils in the present invention. The majority of the olefin polymer fibrils employed in the practice of the invention are small in size, with the largest dimension not exceeding about 10 mm. The fibrils have a large surface to weight ratio of at least about 2 m2 gram as determined by nitrogen absorpion desorption methods. The olefin polymer fibrils deployed in the invention are prepared from an ethylene or propylene polymer having a weight average molecular weight of at least about 1 million and preferably at least about 1.5 million. Sch polymers will have an intrinsic viscosity of at least 3.5 preferably at least 5.0, and most especially at least lC, O.A listing of suitable olefin polymers and olefin polymer mixtures is set forth in U.S. 4,013,751, which description is incorporated herein by reference. The web of randomly dispersed olefir polymer fibrils employed in the invention can be prepared by numerous techniques known and reported iii t.llC art. The preferred method is to prepare a water laid web by the techniques knowe and used in the paper making al5t.S. The fused film is piepaled by heating the web to a temperature above the el ng peint of the olefin g ly ier and subj cting the veb to pressure to compress the melted polymer to form a fused film. The pressure required and the duration of the required heating cycle will depend upon a multiplicity of factors including the thickness and bulk density of the web, the melting point of the olefin polymer, and the heat transfer charactclistics of the press surfaces.The proper combination of t emperature and pressure to be employed for a given web in a particular press can be readily established through a few routine experiments. In pressing a given web at a fixed temperature and a fixed pressure, it is noted that the fibrils at the surface of the web melt first. With the passage of time, the fibrils in the interior of the web melt. If the heating is continued for a sufficient period of time, all of the fibrils melt and a homogeneous fused film is obtained. At intermediate points in the heating cycle, it is noted that the film, while fused, will contain thin fibre like sections of unmelted fibrils. Film containing such a structure has a tensile strength greater than solvent cast film prepared from the olefin polymer from whIch the fibrils were prepared.Accordingly, the temperature, pressure and cycle time should be controlled so that the fused film contains some incomplete ly melted fibrils. A desirable feature of the invent ion is that the fused film can be prepared at high rates of speed at low cost in a continuous process. Tie random web of fibrils is laid down continuosly on a paper making machine. The web then is passed over drying roll and passed through a stack of heated calender rolls The following exarnplc is set forth to illustrate more clearly the principles ad practice of this invention to those skilled in the art.Where parts or percentages are referred to, they are parts or percentages by weight unless otherwise noted Example 1Part A A lot of fibrils was prepared following the procedure of Example 1 of U.S. 4,013,751. The ethylene polymer from which the fibrils were prepared bad a weigh average molecular weight of about 1,500,000. The hydro carbon wet fibrils were refinc.d with 91 isopropanol to displace the hydrocarbon. The fibrils then were filtered and pressed to expel the maximum quantity of isopropanol.Part B Water laid sheets were prepared froze the fibrils of Part A employing an experimental size paper aking machineThe dried sheets had a basis weight of about GO Ibs. per ream. An 8 x 8 sheet was pressed for 5 minutes in a platen press under a pressure of 40,000 psig at a plate temperature of 300 F 149 C . The resulting film was well fused and generally transparent. When viewed in strong light, a few fine fibres were noted in the film. The film had a tensile strength of 4203 psi.. Part C A hydrocarbon solution was prepared from the ethylene polymer employed in Part A and a film was cast therefrom. The film had a tensile strength of 2900 psi
