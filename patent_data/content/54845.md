# MINERAL FILLED POLYPHENYLENE ETHER COMPOSITIONS HAVING IMPROVED PROPERTIES

## Abstract
There are provided compositions comprising a poly phenylene ether resin, a high impact rubber modified polystyrene, a mineral filler other than iron oxide and an effective amount of a plasticizer. Such compositions possess surprisingly improved impact strength in com parison with corresponding compositions in which the plasticizer is not present. In addition, there are provided compositions comprising a polyphenylene ether resin, an impact modifier other than a rubber modified poly styrene, iron oxide and an effective amount of a plasti cizer. Such compositions possess improved modulus in comparison with corresponding compositions in which the iron oxide is not present, with good retention of ductility which is unexpected.
