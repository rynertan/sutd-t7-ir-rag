# Holographic optical head.

## Abstract
A holographic optical head comprises a substrate 62 having a laser diode 64 and a photodetector 66 . A coherent beam from the laser is diffracted by hologram 70 and passes through a hologram beam splitter 76 and a quarter wave plate 78 to a focusing hologram 82 which diffracts and focuses the beam on a record medium 84 . Light reflected from the medium is again diffracted by the hologram 82 and is separated from the incoming beam by the beam splitter 76 , and is diffracted by hologram 72 on to the detector 66 .
