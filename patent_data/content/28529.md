# Scaling tip particularly suitable for dental scaler having circular or ellipsoidal patterns of vibration.

## Abstract
A powered dental scaler is disclosed of a type which drives a vibrating scaling tip 26 in a circular or ellipsoidal pattern of motion. A scaling tip 26 having working surfaces 104, 106, 108 provided by the edges of an elongated, curved element which has a cross sectional configuration in the shape of a multi sided figure, e.g. a triangle or a diamond, is particularly useful with a scaler having this type of vibration al pattern. The scaler tip 26 also has a curved free end portion 94 terminating in a point 28 . Adjacent the point 28 the end portion 94 may have relieved surfaces between the working edges 104, 106, 108 . These configurations enable a dental operator to conduct important dental cleaning operations with a single hand held instrument.
