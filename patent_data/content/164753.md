# High solids coating composition based on fatty polyols.

## Abstract
A composition of matter useful as a high solids coating is disclosed. The composition contains at least one fatty po lyol derived by ring opening an epoxidized fatty alcohol or ester, and at least one methylolamino curing agent. The coat ings from these compositions have increased flexibility as compared to coatings prepared from comparable polyols.
