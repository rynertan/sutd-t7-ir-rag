## Description
Gas turbine engine The present invention relates to gas turbine engines, and particularly to a multi spool type engine. It is well recognized that increasing the pressure ratio of the air exhausting from a compressor in a gas turbine engine increases the efficiency of the engine, particularly during optimum operating conditions0 However, it is also known that surge conditions must be avoided during off design operations, such as during idling and low engine speed operation. In order to meet these requirements, engines have been designed which have two spools, that is, a low pressure compressor stage is mounted on a shaft which in turn mounts a stage of turbine blades, while a first stage of turbine blades is mounted to an independent coaxial shaft on which is mounted the high pressure compressor0 In this way, the high pressure stages can be independently rotated at higher velocities and the low pressure stages at lower power requirements0 These engines have been well developed in the prior art as described in U.S. Patents 2,430,399, Heppner, 1947 2,611,532, Ljungstr√∂m, 1952 2,803,943, Rainbow, 1957 g 3,357,176,Williams, 1967 3,273,340, Hull, Jr., 1966 3,548,597,Etessam, 1970 3,729,957, Petrie et al, 1973 and 3,861,139,Jones, 1975.These patents, with the exception of 3,357,176,Williams, utilize axial compressors. Williams suggests the use of an axial compressor for the low pressure stage and a centrifugal compressor for the high pressure stage. All of the prior art engines are relatively large engines, and thus the axial compressor concept is feasible. axial compressors are made up of rotors including radially extending blades. When such engines are scaled down to below 4000 horsepower, the blades correspondingly become tiny. Axial compressor blades, for instance, on the high pressure stage, would be no larger than a fisg nail in thus rendering the blades ineffective in relation to the airflow. Thus, where high pressure ratios 36 1 are possible on large fan engines using two spool axial compressor designs, it is not presently known to operate small gas turbine engines with pressure ratios higher than 12 1 since it was only thought possible to use single shaft compressors in such engines0 In the Williams patent, the axial compressor of the first stage, although larger than the second stage, would still be of such a size that the blades would be too delicate to ingest normal debris encountered in flight, such as hail, grit, birds, etcO It is an aim of the present invention to provide a small, multi spool gas turbine engine having the capability of air pressure ratios in the area of 15 1 but with variable flow capabilities for off design conditions0 It is an aim of the present invention to provide a small, compact, efficient, inexpensive, gas turbine engine of the multi spool variety having relatively large compressor blades0 A construction of the present invention comprises an engine, an inlet for admitting air into the engine, a low pressure centrifugal compressor mounted on a first shaft, diffuser means extending circumferentially about the centrifugal compressor, duct means for redirecting the compressed fluid exhausting from said diffuser to the axial inlet of a second high pressure centrifugal compressor, said second centrifugal compressor being mounted on a second shaft concentric with the first shaft, diffuser means extending circumferentially about said second centrifugal compressor, means directing said compressed fluid to an annular combustion chamber surrounding said shafts, a turbine rotor mounted on said second shaft and forming a spool with said second shaft and said second centrifugal compressor, and a second turbine rotor mounted to said first shaft and said first centrifugal compressor. In a more specific embodiment of the present invention, a third turbine rotor is provided mounted to a third shaft extending concentrically and centrally of the first and second shafts and adapted to be connected to a transmission means0 Among the advantages of the present invention is the fact that the blades of the centrifugal compressors are relatively large, and thus the first compressor stage downstream of the inlet is more apt to ingest debris than a scaled down axial compressor including a plurality of small scaled down blades0 The high pressure compressor stage is a centrifugal compressor and has larger blades and is more apt to be effective on the airflow than comparable miniaturized axial compressor blades0 Properly designed ducting from the diffuser of the first centrifugal compressor is formed as a series of pipes which redirect the flow and inject the resultant flow from the low pressure compressor axially and at a proper angle, to the incidence of the blades of the high pressure compressor, thereby improving the efficiency of the two centriBugal compressor stages. It is evident from such a construction, that is, using centrifugal compressors, that since a major component of the compressor extends in a radial plane, the overall length of the two spool compressor and thus the engine would be much shorter than a comparable scaled down two stage axial compressor, thereby contributing to the compactness of the engine. It is further evident that in the light of the impeller blades using the centrifugal compressors, fewer parts are required as compared to a similar size, two stage, axial compressor, gas turbine, two spool engine, Of course, shorter gas turbine design means shorter hollow shafts making up the various spools, thereby increasing the dynamic stability of the shaft in operation. Having thus generally described the nature of the invention, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, showing by way of illustration, a preferred embodiment thereof, and in which Figure 1 is a fragmentary axial cross section showing the compression stages of a combustion chamber and turbine stages of a gas turbine in accordance with the present invention Figure 2 is an enlarged detailed view of the second centrifugal compressor and a first turbine rotor making up the spool including the second shaft and Figure 3 is an enlarged detailed fragmentary view, similar to Figure 2, but showing the first centrifugal compress or stage and the second turbine both mounted on the first shaft. Figure 1 shows the compressor and turbine section of a typical gas turbine engine of a type which will develop approximately 1500 horsepower 1119 kW and which will weigh no more than 800 lb 363 keg . As can be seen, the gas turbine engine, as shown in the drawings, is considerably smaller than the type of engines illustrated in certain of the prior art, including the large fan type engines such as shown in U.S0Patent 3,729,957, for instance, Referring to Figure 1, there is provided in series a first centrifugal compressor 14 which is the low pressure stage, and a downstream high pressure centrifugal compressor 16 feeding a combustion chamber 18o The turbine section 20 is located concentrically of the combustion chamber 18. Referring now more specifically to the low pressure compressor section 14, there is provided an annular air intake 22 provided with struts 24. The compressor includes a centrifugal impeller 26 fixed to a hollow shaft S2 and mounting a plurality of centrifugal compressor blades 28. A centrifugal diffuser of the conventional diffuser type may be provided at the outlet of the centrifugal compressor 14, but in this embodiment, a series of diffuser pipes 38 communicate with the diffuser 36 which in turn direct the compressed fluid to the ducts 40 at the inlet of the high pressure compression chamber 16. As will be described in more detail, there are three concentric hollow shafts S1, S2 and S3 extending along the central axis of the engine. Impeller 26 is fixed to one end of the intermediate shaft S2, while the surrounding framing 30, supporting the diffuser 36 and the pipes 38, support shaft S2 by means of bearing 42. The framing supporting the inlet duct 22 also supports shaft S1 by means of bearings 340 Appropriate seals, as illustrated at 32 in Figure 3, are located at the interface between moving and fixed parts of the engine. The high pressure compressor 16 is similar, but on a smaller scale than the compressors 140 The exhaust of the low pressure compressor 14 is channeled through the ducts 40 to the inlet of the centrifugal compressor 16 which mounts blades 46. The impeller 44 of the compressor 16 is mounted directly to a hollow shaft Si supported by bearings 43 and 45, as shown in Figure 2.A peripheral tangential diffuser 48 is provided about the radial exit of the centrifugal compressor 16, and a plurality of diffuser pipes 50 are provided directing the high pressure compressed fluid from the high pressure compressor 16 to the annular airflow passage 52 about the combustion chamber 18o The hot gases emanating from the combustion chamber 18 pass through the hot air passage 54 by the stators 56 and encounter the first turbine stage made up of a rotor wheel 62 mounting turbine blades 58 surrounded by a fixed shroud 60.The rotor wheel 62 is fixed to the shaft S1 which in turn mounts the impeller 44, as shown in Figure 2. Accordingly the turbine blades 58 and rotor wheel 62 drive the high pressure compressor 16 as the shaft Si rotates independently of the shafts S2 and S3. Downstream of the passage 54, the hot gases enoou stator vanes 64 and then a second turbine stage made up of the rotor 70 and turbine blades 66 surrounded by a fixed shroud 68. As can be seen from Figures 1 and 3, the rotor 70 is fixed to the shaft S2 to which the impeller 26 is also mount edO Accordingly, the second turbine stage, including the turbine blade 66, drives the impeller 26, that is, the low pressure compressor, independently of the speed or velocity of the high pressure compressor. Still further downstream in the hot gas passage 54 of the turbine section 20, the hot gases encounter stator vanes 72 followed by a third turbine stage made up of the rotor wheels 76 mounted to framing 78 and 86. The rotor 76 mounts turbine blades 74, while a rotor 84 mounts turbine blades 82o Both turbine rotors 76 and 84 are connected through framing 86 to the innermost shaft S3 which is adapted to provide a motive force.This third stage is known as the power stage as it is from this stage that mechanical power is transmitted0 As can be seen, therefore, from the drawings and the above description, the engine comprises two compressor spools and a power spool with both compressors 14 and 16 being centrifugal compressors with the high pressure compressor 16 being much smaller in size than the low pressure compressor 14o On the other hand, both compressors include relatively short blades which are more rigid than the eqivalent axial compressors which would have much smaller blades, and thus can function more efficiently in the airflow0 Further, the fact that both centrifugal compressors have both horizontal and vertical components, the overal length of the two spool engine, would be much shorter than an equivalent two spool axial compressor configuration0 The size and relative sturdiness of the blades on the impellers 26 and 44 make the i ngestion, for instance, in the low pressure compressor 14 much more acceptable than if equivalent small axial compressor blades were being used, The annular duct 222 which has a relatively radial component, would be covered by a screenS and thus the air intake being at 900 to the axis of the engine and of the general airflow in the engine, would be less likely to ingest grit than conventional intakes0 It has been found that the particular configuration described hereinabove allows compression ratios of above 15 1 even in such small engines where compression ratios above 12 1 were hardly considered, and it was more normal to work with compression ratios of 6 1, for example, As discussed above, it is easier to obtain high compression ratios in the two spool axial compressor device described in the larger engine sizes as illustrated from the prior art than in scaled down, almost miniaturized engines of the type with which the present invention is concerned
