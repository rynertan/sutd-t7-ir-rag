Xanthonderivat der Formel I

## Description
The present invention relates to xanthone derivatives of the formula I The compounds of formula I in accordance with the present invention are useful as diuretics having uricosuric activity and can be used in the treatment of edema or hypertension. Diuretics known to have uricosuric activity like the compounds of the present invention are phenoxyacetic acids typified by thienylic acid US A 3,758,506 . Xanthone 3 oxyacetates showing vasodelative effects are disclosed in DE B 1 172 271. Conventional diuretic hypotensive agents are extensively used as drugs of the first choice in the treatment of hypertension, but they have a high potential of causing hyperuricemia as a side effect. Furthermore, hypertension is often complicated by hyperuricemia and many cases of hyperuricemia are believed to be caused by disorders in the excretion of uric acid. Under these circumstances, there exists a strong need in medical fields for the development of diuretics having uricosuric activity. As already mentioned, thienylic acid is known to be a potential diuretic having uricosuric activity, but is yet to be commercialized because of the high possibility of causing liver disorders as a side effect. As a result of various studies made to overcome these disadvantages, the present inventors have found that the xanthone derivatives of formula I have both uricosuric and diuretic activities and yet cause minimum side effects on the liver. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding. The xanthone derivatives of formula I in accordance with the present invention are specifically classified as the compounds of formula II and furoxanthones of formula III In the xanthone derivatives of formulas I , II and III , the halogen atom is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, and the lower alkyl group is a straight chained or branched alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms . When B is a carboxyl group, the derivatives may form salts with bases. Illustrative salts include alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts and substituted or unsubstituted amine salts. Specific examples of such salts are sodium salts, calcium salts, magnesium salts, ammonium salts, lower alkylamine salts and ethanolamine salts. These salts may be readily formed by conventional methods. The compounds of formual I in accordance with the present invention are novel. The compounds of formula II may be prepared by reacting compounds of formula IV The xanthone derivatives of formula II wherein B is a carboxyl group may also be prepared from corresponding compounds wherein B is a lower alkoxycarbonyl group by conventional methods, for example, by the hydrolysis of them using alkaline hydroxides. Specific examples of the furoxanthone derivatives of formula III in accordance with the present invention are 5 oxo 5H furo 3,2 b xanthenes and 6 oxo 6H furo 2,3 c xanthenes. Compounds of formula IIIa represented by the following formula are included within the scope of the compounds of the present invention. By subjecting these compounds of formula IIIa to oxidation, compounds of formual IIIb which are also within the scope of the invention are obtained The compounds of formula III wherein B is a lower alkoxycarbonyl group may be prepared by esterifying the compounds of formula IIIb in accordance with conventional methods. In these productions, the reaction is carried out in an inert solvent such as ethers and hydrocarbons. The reaction temperature is properly selected from the range of 0 C to about 150 C. Organic peracids such as peracetic acid, perbenzoic acid and m chloroperbenzoic acid may be used as peracids in the step of producing the compounds of formula IIIa from the compounds of formula V . The oxidative reaction by which the compounds of formula IIIa are converted to the compounds of formula IIIb may be performed by a conventional technique, such as by using oxides of manganese, chromium, etc. The compounds of formula V may be prepared by subjecting the corresponding allyl aryl ethers to the Claisen rearrangement reaction. The diuretic and uricosuric activities of the compounds of the present invention were confirmed by the following experiment. Seven week old Wistar Imamichi rats that had been starved for 24 hours were divided in groups of four or five heads so that the animals of each group would excrete almost the same amount of urine. After forced urination, the rats were orally administered the test compounds that were suspended in physiological saline containing 3 gum arabic in a dose volume of 25 ml per kg of the body weight. The suspensions were administered typically in an amount of 100 mg kg. Control rats were given only physiological saline containing 3 gum arabic. The animals were housed in separate metabolic cages and the urine excreted from each animal was collected over a period of 6 hours following the administration of the test compounds or physiological saline after complete starvation. The urine volume was directly read on a measuring cylinder after forced urination there into, and the amount of urine per kg of the body weight was calculated. The amount of uric acid excreted in the urine was determined by the uricase catalase method.
