# Bank selection in naturally commutated thyristor controlled static power converters.

## Abstract
A static converter for generating and supplying to a load an eletrical output waveform of a desired frequency from a multiphase AC voltage source, uses naturally com mutated thyristors arranged in positive and negative banks which are sequentially fired in a manner as to avoid cir culating currents. The nonload carrying bank is instantly identified, and, firing pulses to the thyristors in the nonload carrying bank are inhibited only after the current there through actually goes to zero. Where the thyristors are ar ranged in pulse groups, the firing pulses to each group are inhibited separately and in some instances not all groups in the nonload carrying bank are inhibited. Termination of current flow through a thyristor group is determined by comparing the group output voltage with a composite sig nal representative of the intended group voltage which is generated by summing selected portions of the source volt ages applied to the group. Further firing of the thyristors in the group is inhibited only after the difference between these two signals exceeds a preset threshold value for an interval at least equal in duration to the thyristor reverse recovery time.
