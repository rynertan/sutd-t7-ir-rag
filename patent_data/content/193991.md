# Fine adjusting device for accurate positioning an adjusting element.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a fine adjusting device made of a metal plate 30, 40 , in which slots, arranged in pairs and ending at both ends in holes, form at least a bar parallelogram 30 33 40 43 with play free flexible hinges 34 37, 44 47 as pivots, each bar parallelogram being provided with a fixed bar 30 40 , a shifting bar 33 43 parallel to this fixed bar and two pivoting bars 31, 32 41, 42 . For a combined X Y adjustment two shifting bars 33, 43 , which are at right angles to each other, have to be connected by coupling bars 50, 51 , which each 51, 50, respectively move with the one shifting bar 33, 43, respectively in the one direction X, Y, respectively , and pivot with regard to the one shifting bar 33, 43 respectively in the other direction Y, X, respectively in the same way as the pivoting bars 41, 42 and 31, 32, respectively connected to the other shifting bar 43, 33, respectively , a stabilizing bar 60 being parallel to one 51 of the coupling bars and forming with that coupling bar a bar parallelo am together with two other bars 57, 63 , one 63 of which is rigidly connected to the shifting bar 33 , together with which the latter coupling bar 51 moves.
