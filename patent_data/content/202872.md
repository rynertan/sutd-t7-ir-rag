# Axially compact brake.

## Abstract
An axially compact brake 10 is disclosed according to the teachings of the present invention as being spring engaged and fluid released for rotationally controlling an electric motor shaft for driving a machine, robot, or other apparatus component. The brake includes a housing 24 , formed by an air chamber housing portion 28 and an annular plate 26 . The air chamber housing portion 28 includes a friction interface disc 34 and an axial cylindrical member 36 for reciprocally receiving an annular piston 50 to form a fluid pressure cylinder C . The annular plate 26 is secured to the cylindrical member 36 and includes torque pins 68 extending into the piston 50 . Coil springs 64 extend axially between the annular plate 26 and the piston 50 . The housing portion 28 has a square outer perimeter defining mounting pads 90 at its corners for sandwiching the housing between the apparatus component 23 and the motor 96 . The brake further includes an input hub 12 having a hexagonal outer cross sectional surface 18 for the slidable receipt of a friction disc 74 capturable between the friction interface disc 34 and the piston 50 . The input hub 12 is supported and rotationally mounted within the housing 24 by the motor shaft 21 and independent of the housing. Thus, the brake 10 is axially short and compact allowing the motor to be mounted closely adjacent to the apparatus component 23 . Additionally, the brake of the present invention can be easily and economically manufac tured and assembled.
