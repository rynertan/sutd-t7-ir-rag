# System and method for controlling a machine including a plurality of operating components.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to racing two or more conditions against each other to bring about a response in a controlled machine of a component responsive to the said conditions. In particular, a portion of a machine control is suspended until the occurrence of an event such as an input, a time delay, availability of data, or completion of a task. These conditions race against one another. That is, the occurrence of one of the conditions will initiate the response, and all other conditions will then be ignored. The type of response by the component depends upon the particular condition that occurred first.
