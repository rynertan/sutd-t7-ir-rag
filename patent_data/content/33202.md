# Ferritic stainless steel substrate for catalytic system.

## Abstract
A system comprising a ferritic stainless steel substrate having a tightly adherent oxide coating and a catalytic mater ial therupon. The ferritic stainless steel is of a chemistry which forms a tightly adherent non spalling scale suitable for appli cation of a catalytic bearing material and consists essentially of, by weight, up to 26 chromium, from 1 to 8 aluminium, from 0.02 to 2 hafnium, up to 0.3 yttrium, up to 0.1 carbon, up to 2 silicon, balance essentially iron.
