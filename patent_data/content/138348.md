# Insulated cabinet with interchangeable heat transfer units.

## Abstract
An insulated cabinet 10 with interchangeable heat transfer units 12, 36, 50, 72 disposed on top thereof, the heat transfer units 12, 36, 50, 72 may be refrigeration type units, freezer type units, heating type units, warming type units or proofing units and each of the heat transfer units 12, 36, 50, 72 includes a rectangular opening in the bottom thereof to which is attached a duct 104 through which heat ed or cooled air is forced, the duct 104 has parallel front and rear walls and inclined sides 124, 126 which taper to reduce the cross section of the duct, the duct 104 being a sliding fit inside a tunnel 106 which extends vertically along the back wall of the cabinet 10 . The tunnel 106 is provided with two columns of louvers 140 along its entire length through which the air from the duct 104 flows. Air exiting the louvers 140 is deflected by a baffle plate 146 which extends the full width of the rear of the cabinet 10 . The edge portions 152, 154 of the baffle plate 146 are per forated. The air thus must move out forward through the lou vers 140 then laterally across the solid portion of the baffle plate 146 before turning forward again through the perfo rations in the baffle plate into the interior of the cabinet 10 . The improved air low greatly reduces temperature differ ences within the carbinet 10 when used as an oven, and the air flow over the heating elements is more uniform, re ducing hot spots and thus prolonging their life.
