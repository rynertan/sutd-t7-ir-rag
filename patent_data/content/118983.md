# Textile treatment.

## Abstract
A method for treating textile fibres and synthetic polyamide fibres to enhance their affinity for disperse dyestuffs which comprises treating the fibres with an aqueous solution or dispersion of an arylating agent. The arylating agent contains both a benzene or naphtalene ring and a reactive group, such as a halo triazine group. The fibres may be treated by exhaustion from long liquors or by padding, and the affinity for disperse dyestuffs is consider ably increased thereby.
