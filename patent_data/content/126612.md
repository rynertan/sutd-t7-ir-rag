Novel compounds according to the present invention are those of formula I, including a cycloalkane ring of 5 to 8 ring carbon atoms, with a 2,4 dihydro lE pyrrol l yl substituent adjacent to, or separated from, the carbon atom which may carry substituents R1 and or R2. With reference to formula I, n and p are independently selected from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and 2 6 n p 5 5 X indicates that the 2,5 dihydropyrrolyl group may be in cis or trans configuration with respect to other substituents on the cycloalkane ring q is o or 1 X and Y are independently selected from H, F, Cl, Br, tri fluoromethyl, nitro, C1 C3 alkyloxy, hydroxy, azido, C1 to C3 alkyl, phenyl, methanesulfonyl, cyano, amino, C1 to C3 alkoxycarbonyl, C1 toC3 alkanoyloxy, C1 to C3 carboxacylamino NHC O R4 , sulfonic acid Sg H , Ci C3 al kanoyl, C3 al lyl i c al kenyloxy, benzoyl R is hydrogen or C1 to C3 alkyl R1, taken separately, is hydrogen, hydroxy, mercapto SH , GR3 or OC O and R2, taken separately, is hydrogen or R1 is GR3 and R2 is GR3 or R1 and R2, taken together, are selected from the group consisting of ECHbCHE , E CH2CH2CH2 E , ECHbCH CH3 CH2 E , ECH2C CH3 2CH2 E E, N OH, and H OC O CH3, wherein each E is bivalent sulfur or oxygen wherein each G is bivalent sulfur or oxygen R3 is C1 to C3 alkyl and R4 is H, or C1 to C2 alkyl and the acid addition salts thereof, particularly pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Thus, these N 2 2,5 dihydro 1H pyrrol 1 yl compounds are defined so that if R1 and R2 are other than hydrogen the oxy or thio group substituent R1, R2 , if present , can be separated from the nitrogen bearing cycloaliphatic ring carbons by at least one methylene CH2 group, in which case the R1, R2 substituents will be in the 4 position of the cyclopentyl ring compounds, in the 4 or 5 position of cyclohexyl ring compounds or a mixture of a compound wherein the R1, R2 substituent will be in the 4 position with a compound wherein the R1, R2 substituent will be in the 5 position , in the 4 , 5 or 6 positions of cycloheptyl ring compounds or a mixture of such R1, R2 position isomers , or in the 4, 5, 6 or 7 position of cyclooctyl ring compounds or the p and n definitions can be selected, so that the R1, R2 oxy or thio group substituent s can be bonded to a cycloaliphatic ring carbon atom which is adjacent to the ring carbon atom bearing either the amido nitrogen or the amino nitrogen of the compounds. The compounds of formula I or their acid addition salts in their crystalline state may sometimes be isolated from their reaction mixtures as solvates, i.e., with a discrete quantity of solvent, e.g., water, ethyl acetate, methanol, methylene chloride and the like, associated physically, and thus not affecting the chemical entity per se. It will be recognized by those skilled in the organic chemical art that the carbon atoms at positions 1 and 2 of the cycloaliphatic ring of structure I to which nitrogens are bonded are asymmetrically substituted. Likewise, for certain definitions of R1 and R2, the cycloaliphatic ring carbon atom to which Rr and R2 are bonded may also be asymmetrically substituted. Each of these three carbon atoms can independently possess an R or S configuration and thus a compound of the formula I may have as many as 23 or 8 stereoisomers which comprise four pairs of enantiomers each enantiomeric pair is termed a racemate. See, for example, J.B. Hendrickson, D. J. Cram, and G. S.Hammond, Organic Chemistry, Third Edition, McGraw Hill Book Company,New York, N.Y., 1970, pages 198 230, particularly pages 207, 208, 213, 215. Of the four racemates, two will have the nitrogen containing groups at positions 1 and 2 of structure I in a trans orientation that is, the groups will be on opposite sides of the plane of the cycloaliphatic ring such compounds will be generally referred to in this specification as trans compounds and are meant to include both possible configurations of the third substituted ring carbon if it is asymmetrically substituted.The other two racemates will have the nitrogen containing groups at positions 1 and 2 of structure I in a cis orientation that is, the groups will be on the same side of the cycloaliphatic ring such compounds will be generally referred to in this specification as cis compounds and are meant to include both possible configurations of the third substituted ring carbon atom if it is asymmetrically substituted. The four racemates of structure I compounds can each exist as a mixture of the two enantiomers or each enantiomer of each pair can be separated. Varying mixtures of enantiomers are also possible. When it is desired to specify for a structure I compound the configuration of the other asymmetric centers relative to that of position 1, this is done according to the ChemicalAbstracts Service publication, Naming and Indexing of Chemical Substances for CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS during the Ninth Collective Period 1972 1976 , a reprint of Section IV Selection of Index Names forChemical Substances from the CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS Volume 76 Index Guide.Accordingly, the relative stereochemistry of three asymmetric carbon atoms in the cycloaliphatic ring of formula I compounds is indicated by 1 the arbitrary designation of la for the orientation of the substituent on asymmetric carbon atom number one 2 the designation ax or when the substituent on asymmetric carbon atom number two is on the same or opposite side of the plane of the cycloaliphatic ring, respectively, relative to said C1 substituent and 3 the designation x or xss when the substituent on asymmetric cycloaliphatic ring carbon atom number x is on the same or opposite side of the plane of the cycloaliphatic ring, respectively, relative to said Ci substituent. Two isomers which differ only in the stereochemistry at one asymmetric carbon atom of the cycloaliphatic ring are sometimes referred to herein as epimers. If desired the formula I compounds of this invention can be resolved into their respective d and 1 optical isomers by methods known in the art. In this case, the optical resolution can be done by at least two different routes. The resulting agents by either route are any of the known resolving agents such as optically active camphorsulfonic acid, bis o toluoyltartaric acid, tartaric acid, and diacetyl tartaric acid which are commercially available and which are commonly used for resolution of amines bases , as for example inOrganic Synthesis, Coil. Vol. V., p. 932 1973 , resolution of R and S x phenylethylamine with tartaric acid. By the first method for resolving the compounds of this invention, for example, one of the aminoamide compounds can be converted into its optically active diastereomeric salts by reaction with an optically active acid examples mentioned above in a manner standard in the isomer resolution art. These diastereomeric salts can then be separated by conventional means such as differential crystal libation. Diastereomeric salts have different crystallization properties, which are taken advantage of in this separation, On neutralization of each diastereomeric salt with aqueous base the corresponding optically active enantiomers of the free amino amide can be obtained, each of which can subsequently and separately be converted as hereinafter described in the examples to the desired acid addition salt. By the second method, which in the case of some of these compounds is preferred, the formula I compounds can be made into their respective d and isomers, by first resolving each cis or trans1,2 cycloaliphatic unsymmetrically substituted amino alcohol or diamine into its respective d or isomers by treatment with the resolving agent, crystallization, separation and regeneration of the respective d and l compounds, for example, trans d diamine, trans1 diamine, or the cis ddiamine and cis l diamine, and then reacting the respective resolved diamine starting material with the desired aracyl imidazole III , the acyl halide IV or the acid V in the presence of a condensing agent to form the respective cis or trans dor compound of formula I, which can then be converted to any desired pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt by procedures exemplified hereinafter. In the above formula I compounds, the halogens having atomic numbers of from 9 to 35 are fluorine, chlorine and bromine, the term C1 to C3 al kyl means methyl, ethyl, n propyl and i sopropyl.

In general, the new compounds of this invention formula I compounds above can be prepared by reacting the selected 1,2 cycloaliphatic diamine of the formula II, wherein p, n, R, R1, and R2, are as defined above with 1 a suitable acyl source such as the appropriate acyl imidazole of the formula IIIEMI13.1 wherein q, E, X and Y are as defined above 2 or with an acyl halide of the formula IVEMI13.2 wherein M is chloride or bromide and q, E, X and Y are as defined above in the presence of an acid scavenger such as triethylamine or 3 with the carboxylic acid of the formula VEMI14.1 in the presence of a condensing agent, such as a carbodjimide, wherein q, E, X and Y are as defined above, in an organic solvent for the reactants, preferably in a chlorinated alkane, e.g., methylene chloride, ethylene dichloride, chloroform or carbon tetrachloride or in an ether solvent such as diethyl ether, or a cyclic ether solvent such as tetrahydrofuran THF or dioxane, or the like, until the compound of this invention is produced. Carbodiimides such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or diisopropylcarbodiimide can be used as condensing agents. The reactants II and III or II and IV or II and V can be mixed in substantially equimolar proportions to effect formation of the desired product I , but in cases where the non pertinent amino nitrogens are protected against reaction1 if one of the reactants II , III , IY and V is more expensive than the other, it is sometimes preferred to use a stoichiometric excess of the less expensive reactant to insure that substantially all of the more expensive reactant is consumed in the reactions.The reaction will proceed at ambient temperature for most combinations of reactants, but for some combinations of reactants, variations from the initial to final reaction conditions may vary between 25 C. and reflux temperature of the mixture depending on the reactivity of the reactants, the desired reaction time, the solvent being used, the molar proportions, and similar factors of concern to the chemist operating the process. Procedures for preparing the aracyl imidazoles III and acyl halide IV reactants used to form compounds of this invention are known in the art. See, for example, R. B. Wagner and H. O. Zook,SYNTHETIC ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, 1953, John Wiley and Sons, Chapter 17, p.546 et seq. The aracyl imidazole can be prepared in situ by reacting carbonyldiimidazole with the acid of the formula V in an organic solvent. The carboxylic acids V are either known in the art or are prepared by methods known in the art. Acid addition salts can be prepared by reacting a formula I free base with a stoichiometric amount of an acid, such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen iodide, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, benzoic acid, salicyclic acid, pamoic acid, cyclohexanesulfamic acid, methane sul foni c, naphthal enesul foni c, p tol uenesul foni c, maleic, furmari c, oxalic acids and the like. The reaction can be carried out in aqueous or organic liquid solvent or non aqueous media such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, and the like. Non aqueous media are preferred.When it is desired to obtain optically resolved products in crystalline form, it may be more convenient to form salts such as maleates, citrates or pamoates rather than the inorganic acid addition salts, such as the hydrochlorides. Also, whereas oxalic acid and other equivalent acids can be used to produce the amino amide product in a more easily handled solid form, e.g., in plant manufacturing isolation procedures, it would preferably not be used as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form of the amino amide product. In preparing the compounds of this invention the source of the 2,5 dihydro lH pyrrol l yl moiety is generally 2,5 dihydro 1H pyrrole H CH2CH CHdH2, also known as 3 pyrroline which is known in the literature Chemical Abstracts Registry Number 109 96 6 and is presently commercially available. Procedures for preparing the diamine starting materials II have already been described in the U.S. patents and pending applications listed below, it being necessary only to substitute the 2,5 dihydro1H pyrrole for the amine groups listed for placement in the 2 position of the cycloalkyl rings of the diamines listed therein, recognizing that reaction conditions chosen should not unfavorably alter the double bond of the 2,5 dihydro 1H pyrrole ring if present. Such patents and pending patent applications are U.S. Patent No. 4,145,435, U.S. Patent No. 4,098,904, U.S. Patent No. 4,360,531, U.S. Patent No. 4,359,476 and pending U.S. applications See West German published application No. P 32 41 933.3, pub lishes may 26, 1983 and Belgian Patent No. 895,002, issued May 13, 1983. The term dosage unit form as used in this specification and in the claims refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for mammalian subjects, each unit containing as the essential active ingredient a predetermined quantity of a compound of this in vention with the required pharmaceutical means which adapt said ingre dient for systemic administration. The specification for the novel dosage unit forms of this invention are dictated by and directly de pendent on the physical characteristics of the essential active in gredient and the particular effect to be achieved in view of the limi tations inherent in the art of compounding such an essential active material for beneficial effects in humans and animals, these being features of the present invention.Examples of suitable dosage unit forms in accordance with this invention are tablets, capsules, orally administered liquid preparations in suitable liquid vehicles, sterile preparations in suitable liquid vehicles for intramuscular and intra venous administration, suppositories and sterile dry preparations for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable preparations in a suitable liquid vehicle. Suitable solid diluents or carriers for the solid oral pharmaceutical dosage unit forms are selected from the group consisting of lipids, carbohydrates, proteins and mineral solids, for example, starch, sucrose, lactose, kaolin, dicalcium phospate, gelatin, acacia, corn syrup, corn starch, talc and the like. Capsules, both hard and soft, are filled with compositions of these amino amide active ingredients in combinations with suitable diluents edible oils, talc, calcium carbonate and the like and also calcium stearate. Liquid preparations for oral ad ministration are prepared in water or aqueous vehicles which advan tageously contain suspending agents, for example, methylcellulose, acacia, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol and the like. In the case of injectable forms, the injectable formulation must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability exists.Such preparations must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage, and ordinarily contain in addition to the basic solvent or suspending liquid, preservatives in the nature of bacteriostatic and fungi static agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, benzyl alcohol, phenol, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it is preferable to include osmotically active agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride in isotonic concentrations. Carriers and vehicles include vegetable oils, ethanol, polyols, for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like. Any solid preparations for subsequent extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable preparations are sterilized, preferably by exposure to a sterilizing gas, for example, ethylene oxide.The aforesaid carriers, vehicles, diluents, excipients, preservatives, isotonic agents and the like constitute the pharmaceutical means which adapt the preparations for systemic administration. The pharmaceutical dosage unit forms are prepared in accordance with the preceding general description to provide from about 0.5 to about 350 mg of the essential active ingredient per dosage unit form, which as aforesaid may be in the form of a semi solid or solid, topical, oral or rectal preparation, a liquid oral preparation, an injectable preparation including liquid preparations and solid dry preparations for extemporaneous reconstitution to a liquid injectable preparation. The amount of the essential active ingredient provided in the pharmaceutical dosage unit forms is that amount sufficient to obtain analgesic effects within the aforesaid effective non toxic range. Expressed otherwise, when used systemically, an amount of the essential active ingredient is provided to a recipient within a range from about 0.01 mg per kg to about 5 mg per kg of body weight of the recipient. Preferred dosages for most applications are 0.05 to 2.0 mg per kg of body weight. The useful pharmaceutical dosage unit forms of these compounds in pharmaceutical formulations are preferably adapted for systemic administration to obtain analgesic effects comprising an effective, nontoxic amount of a compound according to formula I or as its pharmacologically acceptable salt. Further, the invention relates to methods of obtaining analgesic effects in mammals, for example, humans and valuable warm blooded animals such as dogs, cats, horses and other commercially valuable animals, by administering systemically to the mammals the aforesaid pharmaceutical dosage unit forms supplying an effective, non toxic amount for analgesic effects. These preferred compounds have an advantage, to a greater extent, depending upon the particular compound, of having lower physical dependence liability than known analgesic compounds such as morphine and methadone, as shown by evaluation of representative compounds and those standard analgesic drug compounds in various pharmacological test procedures which measure analgesia and the physical dependence liability of the test compounds in standard laboratory test animals. Representative examples of these formula I compounds have Ego values of less than about 75 mg kg s.c. subcutaneous administration in standard laboratory animal analgesic tests such as the tail flick, pinch, and hydrochloric acid writhing tests, and the more potent of them have Ego values of less than 10 mg kg s.c. in these tests, while at the same time possessing low apparent physical dependence liability as compared to commercial analgesics used as standards. The procedures used to determine these properties are essentially those ofWay et al., Way, E.L. et al., Simultaneous Quantitative Assessment of Morphine Tolerance and Physical Dependence , J. Pharmacol. Exp.Ther., 167, pp. 1 8 1969 and Saalens et al., Saalens, J. K. et al., The Mouse Jumping Test A Simple Screening Method to Estimate the Physical Dependence Cepacity of Analgesics , Arch. Int.Pharmacodyn., 190, pp. 213 218 1971 . Statistical effective doses ED50 values and 95 confidence limits were calculated by the method of Spearman and Karber Finney, D.J., Statistical Methods inBiological Assay , Hafner Publ., 1952 . Known analgesic drugs such as morphine and methadone exhibit analgesic Ego values of less than 2 mg kg s.c., respectively, in these standard analgesic tail flick, pinch and writhing tests, but are known to have high apparent physical dependence liability effects, and this is confirmed by their morphine and methadone having relatively low naloxone jumping EDsO values ranging from 12 to 30 mg kg s.c. Other representative compounds of this invention have analgesic potencies somewhat less than the preferred compounds an analgesic activity ED50 values up to about 75 mg kg s.c., in these standard tests , and some such compounds still are characterized by having only low to moderate apparent physical dependence liability. It has been found that a representative compound of this inven tion, 1 alpha 2ss 3,4 dichloro N 52 2,5 dihydro 18 pyrrol 1 yl cy clohexyl N methylbenzeneacetamide see Example 1 below is surprisingly and unexpectedly more potent in these analgesic tail flick, pinch and writhing tests than the known compound, Ia, 3,4 dichloro N methyl N 2 1 pyrrolidinyl cycloheXylubenzeneacetamide the compound of Example 14 of U.S. Patent 4,145,435, listed above .It has further been found that the enantiomer form see Example 2 below of this representative compound of this invention is more potent in these same analgesic tests than either the racemate form Example 1 below or the enantiomer form see Example 3 below of the same compound. Nevertheless the enantiomer form Example 3 below of this compound of this invention has surprising potency in these same analgesic tests.
