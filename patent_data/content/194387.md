# A VOICE CONTROLLED TELEPHONE AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING SAME

## Abstract
A voice controlled telephone which learns the user s voice by visually prompting the user to speak command words and numbers. The user can also store names and numbers for commonly called people. When a registered person is to be called, the user merely speaks the person s name and a command to dial the number. One embodiment includes a dedicated voice recognition circuit and a separate telephone control computer while another embodiment, having speaker phone capability, uses a general purpose microprocessor for voice recognition and telephone control. When searching for a match with a user s spoken word, both embodiments scan all stored voice templates for the closest match, display the corresponding telephone number on a visual display and dial the number when a dialing command is recognized.
