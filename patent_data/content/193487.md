S. Patent No. 4,446,793 issued May 8, 1984.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention generally relates to the field of passive electronic countermeasures and more specifically to apparatus for deploying expendable materials such as chaff from a tactical aircraft. The use of chaff to defeat the radar function by denying it range and direction azimuth and elevation information is a well known and practiced technique in the art of radar jamming and or countermeasures. Passive chaff elements in the form of discrete dipoles are dispensed by an aircraft to form a distinct cloud which creates a credible false target to the ground based radar.The dipoles are generally low mass slivers of metalized milar, glass or other suitable dialectric material and these are compactly and densely packaged into canisters and loaded into ejection equipment aboard the aircraft. The ejection equipment fires the chaff out of the canisters into the aircraft windstream where velocity induced turbulence or wind shear effects are available for cloud dispersion. The low mass chaff slivers, upon ejection, rapidly slow down and fall at an almost constant rate. For example, a widely used one mil metalized glass chaff has a settling rate of about 50 feet per minute. One of the problems with present chaff systems is that the low mass slivers are easily damaged by the high compressive force necessary to eject them from the canister and into the aircraft windstream. Being compressed, the chaff dipoles may not uniformly disperse in the windstream and there for will not provide the desired radar countermeasures performance. In actual practice, approximately one third of a pound of various length chaff dipoles are placed into the aircraft boundary layer in approximately 6 to 8 milliseconds. Dipoles from the ejected clumps peel off layer by layer until all that remains is a saturated cloud of dipoles 1 1 2 2 meters in width and height and 10 12 meters in length.Initial formation of the cloud takes approximately 200 milliseconds. At aircraft velocities on the order of 800 feet per second, cloud formation takes place well aft of the aircraft with a maximum cross section of approximately four square meters when viewed on a radial run. From the foregoing, it can be appreciated that full chaff dispersion and or cloud formation is desirable as soon as possible after the chaff are ejected from a loaded canister. This invention provides an improved chaff ejection apparatus for deploying a quantity of dipoles, which apparatus imparts a vector to the chaff cloud that is transverse to the aircraft line of flight. This is accomplished by ejecting the chaff from a spin stabilized payload disk mounted in an ejection cartridge. As the payload disk is ejected from the cartridge, both high linear and rotational velocities are imparted to the disk and it emits the chaff dipoles in a substantially continuous manner as it moves out from the aircraft. When the spinning payload disk is ejected at an angle with respect to the aircraft line of flight for example e 90 degrees and releasing chaff as it moves outwardly, a significant increase in cloud size is achieved while still in the vicinity of the launching aircraft.A particular advantage of the invention resides in the fact that the chaff dipoles are not compressively ejected from the aircraft, but rather, are packaged within an expendable disk. In this respect, the payload disk receives the force necessary for ejection leaving the chaff dipoles in their as packaged condition. The self protect ability of an aircraft is therefore enhanced by the rapid chaff cloud formation and its greater size when viewed by a ground based radar.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Various objects and advantages of the invention will become more apparent and fully understood and appreciated from a consideration of the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in the several figures of which like reference numerals indicate like elements and in which FIGURE 1 is a perspective view, partially broken away, illustrating a chaff payload disk ejection cartridge forming a part of this invention FIGURE 2 is an exposed top plan view of the apparatus of Fig. 1 FIGURE 3 is an elevational view, in crosssection, of the apparatus shown in Fig. 1 as may be taken on line 3 3 of Fig. 2 FIGURES 4A 4C are partial elevational views, in cross section, of a payload disk illustrating various embodiments thereof and FIGURE 5 is a graph illustrating the percentage of chaff dipoles expelled from a payload disk as a function of the wall angle of the disk bore into which the chaff are packaged.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Referring to Figures 1, 2 and 3 of the drawings, an apparatus for deploying passive chaff elements is generally indicated by reference numeral 10. The apparatus 10 occupies a volume space as established by presently used on board aircraft chaff dispensing systems and therefore such apparatus 10 may be readily incorporated into such systems. The apparatus 10 comprises a rectangular cartridge case 12 having side walls 14a and 14b, top and bottom walls 16a and 16b, and end walls 18a and 18b. The walls of the cartridge case 12 may be made of plastic, lightweight metallic or other materials suitable for this type of application and at least one side wall 14a carries a toothed rack segment 20 which occupies a lineal length on its inside surface.One end wall 18a is characterized by an explosive impulse means 22, mounted in the wall, which is a conventional element in chaff deployment apparatus. The impulse means 22 is electrically connected to control circuitry now shown in the usual manner for ignition and detonation of the impulse means. The opposite end wall 18b is removable, that is, it may be easily discharged from the cartridge case 12 in the usual operation of the apparatus and this will be more fully described hereinafter. At least one chaff payload disk generally indicated by reference numeral 24 is carried within the cartridge case 12. A payload disk 24 is substantially cylindrical in shape having a diameter D which is essentially but not necessarily exactly, the distance from one side wall 14a to the opposite side wall 14b and has a height H which is essentially the inside distance from the top 16a to the bottom 16b as clearly evident in Fig. 3 of the drawing. Further, a payload disk 24 is characterized by a plurality of gear like teeth 26 formed about at least a portion of its circumferential extent. The teeth 26 are adapted for engagement with the teeth of the rack segment 20 such as to impart a rotation to the payload disk 24, about its axis A , as it moves lengthwise from one end 18a of the cartridge case to the opposite end 18b. Referring now to Figures 4A, 4B, and 4C of the drawings, various configurations for a payload disk 24 are illustrated. In Fig. 4A, a partial cross section is shown, the payload disk having a top end indicated at 24a and a bottom end indicated at 24b. The cylindrical shape of the disk 24 defines a bore 28, which bore is characterized by a diameter at the top end 24a that is greater than the diameter at the bottom end 24b. The bore walls are therefore tapered outwardly from the bottom of the disk and define an angle taken with respect to the cylinder axis A . The payload disk 24 shown in Fig. 4A has a closed end at the bottom 24b and a plurality of chaff dipoles generally indicated at 30 are packaged and or carried within the disk bore 28.A plurality of gear like teeth 26 are formed in at least a portion of the outer circumferential extent of the disk 24 and preferably in the thicker portion of the cylinder wall at the bottom end 24b. Accordingly, the rack segment 20 is formed in the cartridge case wall 14a along a lineal length at the bottom thereof such as to engage the teeth 26 when the payload disk 24 is loaded into the case 12. Fig. 4B illustrates a similar payload disk 24 , but according to this emobidment the bottom end 24b is not closed. The payload disk 24 is therefore an open cylinder and containment of the chaff 30 within the bore 28 is accomplished by the fact that the cartridge case top and bottom walls 16a,16b are spaced apart a distance substantially the height B of the payload disk 24 . The plurality of gear like teeth 26 are also formed at the bottom end 24b of the disk 24 . Fig. 4C illustrates an alternative embodiment wherein a payload disk 249 has a bore 28 having tapered wall surfaces which extend from a larger diameter at both of the top and bottom ends 24a and 24b respectively, terminating in a smaller diameter at the center of the disk bore at 28c .According to this embodiment, the teeth 26 are located about the centerline of the disk 24 and therefore the rack segment 20 must be located along a lineal length at the mid point of the cartridge case wall 14a. While it is recognized that the position and location of the gear teeth 26 and rack segment 20 may be varied along the height H , the taper of the walls of the bore 28 is optimized at a particular angle . Figure 5 illustrates the relationship of the percentage chaff payload which may be expelled from a payload disk 24 as a function of the bore wall angle . The graph ofFig. 5 was generated by mounting payload disks 24 having various bore angles in a test fixture.The test fixture spun each disk 24 to 1725 rpm within a few milliseconds. Because only rotational velocity and no linear velocity was imparted to the payload disks, the angle will be lower than the optimum of about 15 degrees as indicated in the figure. It is considered that the addition of a linear velocity and the effects of windshear experienced at the boundary layer of a tactical aircraft, that the angle must be at least 5 degrees with respect to the disk bore axis. In operation, a cartridge case 12 is loaded into a dispenser block which is not part of this invention, but suffice to say that such block carries and retains a plurality of cartridge cases 12, provides a firing pulse as appropriate to the impulse explosive means 22, and provides the necessary physical restraint against expansion of the cartridge case when the impulse means 22 is detonated. Upon detonation of the impulse means 22, the pressure within the cartridge case between the end wall 18a and the payload disk 24 increases by several hundred pounds per square inch in a substantially instantaneous manner. This pressure accelerates the disk 24 towards the opposite end 18b, while simultaneously, the engaged rack and gear teeth 20,26 impart a rotational acceleration to the disk 24.The removable wall 18b is discharged from the cartridge case by, either the build up of internal pressure within the case or by the payload disk as it exits the case. The payload disk 24 clears the exit plane of the cartridge case 12 within a few milliseconds exhibiting relatively high linear and rotational velocities. In this circumstance, chaff dipoles carried within the payload disk bore 28 begin dispersing by reason of the spinning action of the disk, the absence of any member to contain the chaff within the disk bore 28, and the wind shear effect present along the boundary layer of the aircraft. The tapered wall surfaces of the disk bore 28 further enhances the ability of the chaff to be dispersed and insures that a high percentage of the chaff is expelled from the payload disk case. From the foregoing, it must be appreciated that, because the payload disk 24 is spin stabilized by its loaded relationship within the cartridge case 12, the chaff dipoles are released at various distances outboard of the aircraft flight axis. The result of this is that a chaff cloud is formed almost instantaneously, ie., in the near vicinity of the launching aircraft. In fact, a chaff cloud exhibiting a greater radar cross section response is formed during the first critical few milliseconds than herebefore accomplished by the prior art. Of course, payload deployment may be further optimized by varying the density and mass of the payload disk 24 and or varying the packaging density of the chaff dipoles 30.
