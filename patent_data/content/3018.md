# Method and apparatus for loading a bale into a fluff generator.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for loading a fresh bale of stacked wood pulp sheets 36 into a continuously rotating bale milling cradle 12 of a fluff generator, usually on top of a partially exhausted bale 10 . A bale loader cradle 24 is mounted above the bale milling cradle 12 and is provided with mechanism for selectively holding the bale loader cradle 24 stationary while the bale milling cradle 12 continues to rotate and while a fresh bale 36 is loaded into the bale loader cradle 24 . When it is desired to transfer the fresh bale 36 into the bale milling cradle 12 , the two cradles are driven in synchronism with the cradles aligned. The floor 33 of the bale loader cradle 24 is then retracted and gravity transfers the fresh bale 36 from the bale loader cradle 24 into the bale milling cradle 12 . After transfer has been completed, the bale loader cradle 24 is stopped in alignment with a bale delivery conveyor 18 to ready it to accept another fresh bale.
