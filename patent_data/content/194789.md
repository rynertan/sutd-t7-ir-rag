# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR MULTIPLE SIMULTANEOUS ASSAY

## Abstract
A diagnostic system and a method for the simultaneous assay of a plurality of samples to detect a ligand is provided. The diagnostic system includes a plurality of reaction chambers which can be aligned. A dipstick card containing a plurality of dipsticks is provided. The dipsticks are in a configuration which permits simultaneous insertion of the dipsticks into an aligned set of chambers. The diagnostic system is particularly suitable for immunoassay and nucleic acid hybridization techniques.
