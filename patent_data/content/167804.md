# Flexible disk drive with an apparatus to load and unload a flexible disk.

## Abstract
A torsional actuator is disclosed for loading and unload ing a flexible disk drive 11 . The actuator includes a torsion beam 48 having a biasing arm 52 and a plurality of actuating arms 56 extending therefrom with the free ends of the actuating arms being separately engageable with different ones of the collet, pressure pad 30 and recording head arm 40 of the flexible disk drive 11 . The arms of the actuator are configured to enable selective and sequential movement of the collet, pressure pad and or recording head arm in one direction toward a disk within the disk to establish a loaded, or operational, position and in the opposite direction away from a disk within the drive to establish an unloaded, or disk accessing, position with such positioning being determined by a force applying cam engageable with the actuator.
