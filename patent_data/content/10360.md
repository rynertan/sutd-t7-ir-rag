# Prostane derivatives, processes for their preparation and their pharmaceutical compositions.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to 9β aryloxy prostane derivatives, for example 16 3 chlorophenoxy 11α, 15α dihydroxy 16 methyl 9β phenoxy 18, 19, 20 trinor 5 cis, 13 trans prostadienoic acid, which possess high activity as abortifa cients, cervical softeners, inducers of parturition or inhibitors of gastric acid production in mammals. These properties are typical of prostaglandin analogues of the E series, but chemi cally the new 9β aryloxy prostane derivatives are prostaglan din F series analogues and are therefore more stable than the E series analogues previously used for the above purposes. The new derivatives are manufactured by known analogy processes, and are formulated in conventional manner.
