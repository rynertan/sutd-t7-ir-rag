# Rear height controller for a vehicle body.

## Abstract
When a vehicle passes over a protrusion or a depression in the road surface, the front wheels move up or down first. The rear height controller detects this movement of the front wheels and lowers the rear of the vehicle in case of a protrusion, and raises it in case of a depression to maintain the resulting rear vehicle height as unchanged as possible. A front vehicle height sensor detects the distance between the body and the front wheel and sends a front vehicle height signal to a protrusion judgment means and a sinking judgment means. The protrusion judgment means and the sinking judgment means compare the front vehicle height signal with predetermined reference signals to judge whether the signal indicates a definite protrusion or a depression. If a definite protrusion or depression is detected, a rear vehicle adjustment means changes the rear vehicle height by acting on the rear suspension.

## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION REAR HEIGHT CONTROLLER FOR A VEHICLE BODYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a rear height controller for a vehicle. More particularly, the invention relates to a rear height controller which is effective against a single shock caused by a protrusion or a depression in a road surface on which an automobile is running. Conventionally, these kinds of apparatus are proposed, for example, in the published unexamined Japanese patent applications Sho 57 172808, Sho 59 23713 and Sho 59 23712.These are such that they detect a body height, or an upward or a downward acceleration of a body of a running vehicle by vehicle height sensors and when the detected signal is greater than a preset value and lasts longer than a preset time, they judge that the running road is a rough road and consequently change the vehicle height to improve the riding feeling of the vehicle. However, under the above mentioned conventional control, the vehicle is not judged to be running on a rough road, until a large turbulence is continuously detected by the vehicle height sensor. If the vehicle passes over a joint or patches of the road having a single protrusion or depression, the vehicle usually receives only a single shock and resumes running on a flat part of the road again, so that the vehicle height is not altered. For that reason, the occupants of the vehicle are not protected from the unpleasant shock due to such single protrusion or depression, which is different from the case that the vehicle is running on a rough road having continuous protrusions, sinkings or depressions. On some cases of running over such single protrusion or depression, the controllability and the stability of the vehicle deteriorate as well.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to appropriately control the height of the rear part of the body of a vehicle, to maintain the controllability and the stability of the vehicle and provide the occupants of the vehicle with a smooth ride. Another object of the present invention is to alter the height of the rear part of a vehicle passing over such a single protrusion or depression of the road surface like a joint of the road to keep the posture of the vehicle unchanged as much as possible which leads to a good controllability and stability of the vehicle and the comfortable feeling of riding. An additional object of the present invention is to return the height of the rear part of a vehicle to the original state as soon as the vehicle resumes running on a flat part of the road after passing over the single protrusion or depression of the road surface, to always control the suspension to a characteristic appropriate to the condition of the road surface at any point in time. According to the present invention, a rear height controller of a body for a vehicle having height adjustment means between the body of the vehicle and its wheels comprises the following means in order to attain the objects a front vehicle height detection means by which a distance between the front wheel and the body of the vehicle is detected to generate a front vehicle height signal b a protrusion judgment means by which the front vehicle height signal is compared with a predetermined reference signal to generate a protrusion signal when the front vehicle height signal is less than the predetermined reference signal c a sinking judgment means by which the front vehicle height signal is compared with a predetermined reference signal to generate a sinking signal when the front vehicle height signal is greater than the predetermined reference signal and d a rear height adjustment means for lowering the height of the body at the rear axle of the vehicle in accordance with the protrusion signal and to raise the height of the body at the rear axle of the vehicle in accordance with the sinking signal. The front vehicle height detection means detects the distance between the front wheel and the body of the vehicle and generates a front vehicle height signal to send to the protrusion judgment means and the sinking judgment means. The front vehicle height signal may be either one of the following signals a signal indicating a displacement of the height of the vehicle from an average height thereof, and a signal indicating a speed of the displacement of the height of the vehicle. Other kinds of front vehicle height signals may be used. The protrusion judgment means and the sinking judgment means receive the front vehicle height signal and compare the signal with predetermined reference signals. When the front vehicle height signal indicating a displacement from an average vehicle height is less than the reference signal, which shows that the front wheels move up on a definite protrusion of a road surface, the protrusion judgment means generates a protrusion judgment signal. If the vehicle height signal indicates a speed of the displacement, the protrusion means compares the absolute value of the signal with a reference signal only when the sign of the signal corresponds to a moving up of the wheels. The sinking judgment means performs a similar function to the protrusion judgment means but corresponding to a movement of front wheels down a definite depression in a road surface. The rear height adjustment means lowers the rear part of the vehicle body in accordance with the protrusion judgment signal and raises it in accordance with the sinking judgment signal. Those height adjustment operations maintain the posture of the running vehicle unchanged as much as possible by compensating for the movement of the rear wheels caused by the protrusion or depression a short time after the front wheels passed it. The object of the control operation of the rear height adjustment means can be gas suspensions, liquid suspensions, mechanical suspensions, etc. In case of gas suspensions, the rear height adjustment means controls gas feed to or gas discharge from gas chambers of the rear gas suspensions to lower or raise the height of the body at the rear axle of the vehicle. In case of liquid suspensions, the rear height adjustment means controls liquid feed to or liquid discharge from the liquid cylinders of the rear liquid suspensions to lower or raise the height of the body at the rear axle of the vehicle. And, in case of mechanical suspensions, the rear height adjustment means controls mechanical apparatus of the rear mechanical suspensions to lower or raise the height of the body at the rear axle of the vehicle. The rear height adjustment means returns the altered heights to the original height a predetermined time, advantageously depending on the vehicle speed, after the protrusion signal or the sinking signal is generated. This is done for adjusting the vehicle height in accordance with a flat part of the road after both the front and rear wheels have passed the protrusion or depression of the road surface.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS A preferred embodiment of the invention will be disclosed hereinafter with reference to the appended drawings in which Fig. 1 shows an outline of the structure of the embodiment of the present invention Fig. 2 shows the details of the structure of the embodiment of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 A shows a sectional view of the main part of an air suspension Fig. 3 B shows a sectional view along a line III B IIIB of the air suspension shown in Fig. 3 A Fig. 4 shows the structure of an electronic control unit ECU Fig. 5 A shows the structure of an input section which receives a digital front vehicle height signal Fig. 5 B shows the structure of an input section which receives an analog front vehicle height signal Figs. 6 A , B , C and D show flow charts of processings which are performed in the ECU of the embodiment of Fig. 4 Fig. 7 shows a flow chart of some of the processings, which are for calculating an average value of the vehicle height signal Fig. 8 shows a flow chart of some of the processings, which correspond to the incremental counting of a timer and Figs. 9 A , B , C and D show time charts of some of the processings.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS A preferred embodiment of the present invention is hereinafter described with explanatory figures.

An axle not shown in the drawings is supported. at the lower end of the cylinder 12a of the shock absorber 3a.An elastic cylindrical assembly 18 for elastically supporting a piston rod 12b to the vehicle body 16 is provided at the upper end of the piston rod 12b extending from the piston not shown in the drawings slidably fitted in the cylinder 12a.The shock absorber 3a is a conventional buffer whose damping force can be varied for adjustment by operating the valve function of the piston. A control rod 20 for adjusting the damping force is liquid tightly and rotatably fitted with a sealing member 22 in the piston rod 12b. The air spring unit 14 has a chamber 32 which is defined by a circumferential member 26 comprising a bottom 26a provided with an opening 24, through which the piston rod 12b is allowed to extend, and a wall 26b rising from the peripheral portion of the bottom 26a, an upper housing member 28a covering the circumferential member 26 and secured on the vehicle body, a lower housing member 28b open at the lower end and coupled to the lower end of the upper housing member 28a, and a diaphragm 30 made of an elastic material and closing the lower end of the lower housing member 28b. The chamber 32 is divided into a lower main air chamber 3b and an upper auxiliary air chamber 3c by a partition member 36 secured on the bottom 26a of the circumferential member 26 and having an opening 34 corresponding to the opening 24 provided in the bottom 26a. Both the chambers 3b and 3c are filled with compressed air. The partition member 36 is fitted with a conventional buffer rubber 40 which can be brought into contact with upper end of the cylinder 12a. The buffer rubber 40 has a passage 42 for connecting the openings 24 and 34 to the main air chamber 3b. The elastic cylindrical assembly 18 is disposed inside the circumferential member 26 whose wall 26b defines the inside circumferential surface of the auxiliary air chamber 3c, in such manner that the assembly 18 surrounds the piston rod 12b. The cylindrical elastic assembly 18 is provided with a valve unit 44 for controlling the communication of both the air chambers 3b and 3c. The assembly 18 comprises an outer cylinder 18a, a cylindrical elastic member 18b and an inner cylinder 18c which are disposed concentrically to each other.The cylindrical elastic member 18b is secured on both the cylinders 18a and 18c. The outer cylinder 18a of the assembly 18 is press fitted on the wall 26b of the circumferential member 26 secured on the vehicle body, under the action of the upper housing member 28a. The valve casing 44a of the valve unit 44, through which the piston rod 12b is allowed to extend, is secured on the inner cylinder 18c. Since the piston rod 12b is secured on the valve casing 44a, the piston rod is elastically supported to the vehicle body by the cylindrical elastic assembly 18. An annular air sealing member 46 is tightly packed in between the outer cylinder 18a and the bottom 26b of the member 26. An annular air sealing member 48 is tightly packed in between the piston rod 12b and and the valve casing 44a.An annular air sealing member 50 is tightly packed in between the inner cylinder 18c and the valve casing 44a. The valve casing 44a has a hole 52 which is open at both ends and extends in parallel with the piston rod 12b. A rotary valve 44b is rotatably supported in the hole 52. The valve 44b comprises a main portion 56a, which can be brought into contact with a lower positioning ring 54a provided at the lower end of the hole 52, and a small diameter operating portion 56b projecting from the main portion above the elastic cylindrical assembly 18. An upper positioning ring 54b, which cooperates with the lower positioning ring 54a to prevent the valve 44b from dropping out of the hole 52, is provided at the upper end of the hole 52. An annular sealing base 60 holding an inner air sealing member 58a and an outer air sealing member 58b for tightly closing the hole 52 is provided between the upper positioning ring 54b and the main portion 56a of the valve 44b.A friction reducer 62 for smoothing the rotative motion of the valve 44b when the main portion 56a of the valve is pushed to the sealing base 60 by air pressure is provided between the sealing base and the main portion of the valve. A chamber 64, which communicates with the main air chamber 3b through the openings 24 and 34 and the passage 42 of the buffer rubber 40, is formed in the lower portion of the elastic cylindrical assembly 18. The main portion 56a of the valve 44b has a recess 66 open to the chamber 64, and has a communication passage 68 extending through the main portion 56a in a diametral direction thereof across the recess 66. The valve casing 44a, which houses the valve 44b, has a pair of air passages 70, each of which can communicate at one end with the communication passage 68, as shown in Fig. 3 B . The air passages 70 extend on almost the same plane outwards in a diametral direction of the hole 52, toward the peripheral surface of the valve 44b. The other end of each air passage 70 is open to the peripheral surface of the valve casing 44a through a face hole 72. An air passage 74, which can communicate at one end with the communication passage 68, extends on almost the same place as the pair of air passages 70 toward the peripheral surface of the valve casing 44a, between the pair of air passages 70 outside the hole 52. The diameter of the air passage 74 is smaller than that of each of the air passages 70. The other end of the air passage 74 is open to the peripheral surface of the valve casing 44a through a face hole 75.The inside circumferential surface of the inner cylinder 18c covering the peripheral surface of the valve casing 44a has an annular recess 76 which surrounds the peripheral surface of the valve casing to connect the face holes 72 and 75 for the air passages 70 and 74 to each other. The inner cylinder 18c has an opening 78 which extends continuously to the recess 76 which constitutes an annular air passage. The cylindrical elastic member 18b has through holes 80, which extend outwards in the radial direction of the member 18b correspondingly to the openings 78. The through holes 80 are made open to the peripheral surface of the outer cylinder 18a through the openings 82 of the cylinder so that the openings 78 and 82 and the through holes 80 define an air passage including the air passages 70 and extending through the elastic cylindrical assembly 18. The peripheral surface of the wall 26b of the circumferential member 26 covering the outer cylinder 18a are provided with plural openings 84 which are located at equal intervals in the circumferential direction of the member 26 and extend continuously to the auxiliary air chamber 3c to connect the openings 78 and 82 and the through holes 80 to the auxiliary air chamber 3c. The peripheral surface of the outer cylinder 18a is provided with an annular recess 86 which surrounds the outer cylinder at the openings 82 to connect the openings 84, 78 and 82 and the through holes 80 to each other.The openings 84 extend continuously to the recess 86 constituting an annular air passage. Although the openings 78 and 82 and the through holes 80 are provided correspondingly to the two air passages 70 of the valve casing 44a in the embodiment shown in Fig. 3 B , the air passages 70 and 74 can be provided in optional positions in the circumferential direction of the elastic member 18b because the annular air passage 76, with which the air passages 70 and 74 communicate, is formed between the inner cylinder 18c and the valve casing 44a. A control rod 20 for adjusting the damping force of the shock absorber 3a, and a conventional actuator 3d for rotating the valve 44b of the valve unit 44, are provided at the upper end of the piston rod 12b, as shown Fig. 3 A . Since the air suspension 3 has the above mentioned construction, the air suspension performs actions described hereinafter. When the valve 44b is kept in such a closed position shown in Fig. 3 B that the communication passage 68 of the valve does not communicate with any of the air passages 70 and 74 of the valve casing 44a, the main air chamber 3b and the auxiliary air chamber 3c are disconnected from each other so that the spring constant of the suspension 3 is set at a large value.When the actuator 3d has rotated the valve 44b into such a position that the communication passage 68 of the valve communicates with the large diameter air passages 70 of the valve casing 44a, the main air chamber 3b is connected to the auxiliary air chamber 3c through the communication passage 68 communicating with the main air chamber, the large diameter air passages 70 and the openings 78 and through holes 80 of the elastic assembly 18 and the openings 82 and 84, so that the spring constant of the suspension 3 is set at a small value.When the valve 44b is rotated into such a position by the regulated actuator 3d that the communication passage 68 of the valve communicates with the small diameter communication passage 74 of the valve casing 44a, the main air chamber 3b is connected to the auxiliary air chamber 3c through the communication passage 68 communicating with the main air chamber, the small diameter air passage 74, the air passage 76, the openings 78 and through holes 80 of the elastic assembly 18 and the openings 82 and 84, so that the spring constant of the suspension 3 is set at an intermediate value because the small diameter air passage 74 provides a higher air flow resistance than the large diameter air passages 70. Leveling valves 151 154 are provided for the air suspensions 3 6, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2. A compressed air feed and discharge system 200, which is described below, is connected to or disconnected from the main air chambers 3b 6b of the air suspensions 3 6 by the leveling valves 151 154 depending on whether electricity is supplied to solenoids 151a 154a. When the leveling valves 151 154 are opened, compressed air is fed to the air suspensions, the height of the vehicle is increased. If the compressed air is discharged from the air suspensions, the height of the vehicle is decreased. When the leveling valves 151 154 are closed, the height of the vehicle is maintained. In the compressed air feed and discharge system 200, a compressor 200b is driven by a motor 200a to produce the compressed air. An air drier 200c dries the compressed air to be fed to the air suspensions 3 6, to protect pipes and the parts of the air suspensions from moisture and prevent a pressure abnormality due to a moisture phase change in the main air chambers 3b 6b and auxiliary air chambers 3c 6c of the air suspensions. When the compressed air is fed to the air suspensions, a check valve 200d provided with a fixed orifice is opened. When the compressed air is discharged from the air suspensions, the check valve 200d is closed so that the air flows out through only the fixed orifice.When the compressed air is discharged from the air suspensions 3 6, a release solenoid valve 200e is driven so that the compressed air discharged from the air suspensions through the fixed orifice at the check valve 200d and through the air drier 200c is released into the atmosphere. The solenoid valve 200e can be regulated to change the volume of each of the main air chambers of the air suspensions 3 6 to adjust the height of the vehicle. A vehicle speed sensor 250 is provided in a speedmeter, for example, so that the sensor sends out a pulse signal corresponding to the speed of the vehicle, in response to the motion of the axle of the vehicle. The output signals of the vehicle height sensors 1 and 2 and the vehicle speed sensor 250 are entered into an electronic control unit hereinafter referred to as ECU 300, which processes these signals to send out drive signals to the actuators 3d 6d of the air suspensions 3 6, the leveling valves 151 154, the motor 200a of the compressed air feed and discharge system 200 and the solenoid valve 200e to perform appropriate control if necessary. Fig. 4 shows the construction of the ECU 300. A central processing unit hereinafter referred to as CPU 301 receives the output data from the sensors and performs operations on the data, in accordance with a control program, to carry out processings for the control of various units or means or the like. The control program and initial data are stored in a read only memory hereinafter referred to as ROM 302.The data, which are entered in the ECU 300, and data necessary for operations and control, are stored into and read from a random access memory hereinafter referred to as RAM 303. A backup randomaccess memory hereinafter referred to as backup RAM 304 is backed up by a battery so that even if the ignition key switch of the automobile is turned off, the backup RAM retains data which are needed after the turning off of the switch. An input section 305 comprises an input port not shown in the drawings, a wave shaping circuit provided if necessary, a multiplexer which selectively sends out the output signals of the sensors to the CPU 301, and an A D converter which changes an analog signal into a digital signal. An output section 306 comprises an output port not shown in the drawings, and a drive circuit for driving the actuators according to the control signals of the CPU 301 as occasion demands. A bus 307 connects circuit components such as the CPU 301 and the ROM 302, the input section 305 and the output section 306 to each other to transmit data. A clock circuit 308 sends out a clock signal CK at prescribed intervals to the CPU 301, the ROM 302, the RAM 303 and so forth so that a control timing is set by the clock signal. If the output signal of the vehicle height sensor 1 is a digital signal, the signal is transmitted to the CPU 301 through the input section 305 including a buffer as shown inFig. 5 A . Fig. 5 A shows the structure of an input section which receives a digital front vehicle height signal. If the output signal of the vehicle height sensor 1 is an analog signal, a construction as shown in Fig. 5 B is provided. In the latter case, the vehicle height sensor 1 sends out the analog signal of a voltage corresponding to the height of the vehicle. The analog voltage signal is converted into a voltage VHF CR indicating an average height of the vehicle, by a CR filter circuit 305a made of a low pass filter. The voltage VHF CR is applied to an AID converter 305b.The analog voltage signal is also directly applied as a voltageVHF S indicating the current height of the vehicle, to theA D converter 305b. The converter 305b changes both the input signals into digital signals through the action of a multiplexer. The digital signals are transmitted from the converter the CPU 301. The same thing applies to the left front wheel vehicle height sensor 2. The processings, which are performed by the ECU 300, are hereinafter described referring to a flow chart shown in Fig.6 A , 6 B . The flow chart indicates the processings J performed by the ECU 300 in response to the vehicle height sensor 1 of the linear type which sends out an analog signal, as shown in Fig. 5 B . The processings are repeatedly performed at every prescribed time, such as 5 msec.The outline of the processings shown in the flow chart is described as follows 1 A current vehicle height VHF S and an average vehicle height VHF CR are determined Steps 516 and 518 2 It is judged whether or not the current vehicle height has displaced more than a predetermined value hO from the average vehicle height Step 524 3 If the current vehicle height is judged to have displaced below the predetermined value hO from the average vehicle height, the front wheels are judged to move up on a protrusion and the vehicle height at the rear axle is lowered Step 530 by driving the solenoids 751a and 152a to open the leveling valves 151 and 152 and opening the release solenoid valve 200e in Fig. 2 4 It is judged whether or not the current vehicle height has displaced over a predetermined value hl from the average vehicle height Step 552 5 If the current vehicle height is judged to have displaced over the predetermined value h1 from the average vehicle height, the front wheels are judged to move down in a sinking or depression and the vehicle height at the rear axle is raised Step 558 by driving the solenoids 151a and 152a to open the leveling valves 151 and 152 to the main air chambers 3b and 4b of the air suspensions 3 and 4 in Fig. 2 and 6 After the processings of step 5 , the vehicle height is returned to the original state if it is altered by step 3 or 5 . The details of the processings are hereinafter described.The processings are repeatedly performed in every 5 msec. It is firstly judged whether or not the processings are being performed for the first time since the activation of the ECU Step 510 . If the processings are judged to be being performed for the first time, initial setting is effected Step 512 , all variables are cleared and all flags are reset. After the initial setting is effected Step 512 or if the processings in the routine are judged to be being performed for the second time or later, the speed V of the vehicle is detected Step 514 in terms of the output signal of the vehicle speed sensor 250. A current vehicle height VHF S is then detected Step 516 . To detect the current vehicle height, either of the outputs of the vehicle height sensors for the right and left front wheels of the vehicle may be used. Since the rear wheels receive a shock regardless of which of the front wheels has moved up or down due to the protrusion or depression of the road surface, the average of the outputs of both the vehicle height sensors for the front wheels may be used or the larger one of the outputs may be used.An average of the past outputs of the vehicle height sensor 1 is determined to set an average vehicle height Step 518 . In this embodiment, the average vehicle height VHF CR is directly determined from the output signal of the vehicle height sensor 1 through the CR filter circuit 305a made of the low pass filter, as shown in Fig. 5 B . If the vehicle height sensor 1 is sending out a digital signal, the average vehicle height may be calculated from past vehicle heights VHF S measured in the ECU 300. For example, the calculation can be effected by adopting processings shown in Fig. 7, instead of adopting the processings in Steps 516 and 518 shown in Fig. 6 A . In the processings shown in Fig. 7, a current vehicle height VHF S n is detected first Step 710 , and an averageVHFa,n of the vehicle height is then calculated Steps 730 and 740 in every predetermined operation unit time tms Step 720 . In step 730, the following calculation is performed VHFa,n k 1 VHFa,n 1 VHFb,n 1 VHF S k where k Number of measured value to be averaged VHFa,n Averaged to be calculated currently n th time VHFa,n 1 Averaged calculated previously n 1 th time VHF s ,n Average to be calculated currently n th time andVHFb,n 1 Value calculated previously for convenience to calculate the average VHFa,n.In Step 740, the value VHFb,n is calculated as follows VHFb,n mod k k 1 VHFa,n 1 VHFb,n 1 VHF S n In such calculation, mod A B means the value of the remainder in the division of B by A. The processings in Steps 730 and 740 constitute such a simple method that a value approximate to the average can be calculated if only the values VHFa,n, VHFa,n 1 and VHFb,n 1 are stored in a memory beforehand. As for thesimple method, past k 1 pieces of data do not need to be stored in the memory, so that the space of the memory and the time of the calculation are saved. If the space of the memory and the time of the calculation are enough for use, a required number of measured values may be averaged normally. After the detection of the average Step 518 as shown inFig. 6 A , it is judged Step 520 whether or not the control of each suspension is in an automatic mode. If the driver of the vehicle has not selected the automatic mode by a manual switch, the processings in the routine are terminated. If he has selected the automatic mode, it is judged Step 522 whether or not the vehicle is not lower than a predetermined level, and whether the vehicle is judged to be moving. If the vehicle is judged to be moving, it is then judged Step 524 whether or not the difference VHF CR VHF S of the averaged vehicle height VHF CR from the current vehicle height VHF S has exceeded a predetermined value hO.If the difference is judged to be greater than the predetermined value hO, it is then judged whether a flag FP is reset Step 526 , i.e. FP O, which indicates that the front wheels do not move up on a protrusion of a road surface yet. If the flag FP is reset, the flag FP is set Step .528 and the rear vehicle height is lowered Step 530 . In operation, the solenoids 151a and 151b are driven to open the leveling valves 151 and 152 and at the same time the release solenoid valve 200e is opened for a predetermined time tl. With these operations, the upward movement of the rear wheels caused by the protrusion which the front wheels detected before is compensated to maintain the posture of the running vehicle as unchanged as possible.The controllability and the ride comfort of the vehicle are thus maintained in passing the protrusion. As the next processings, a timer Ti is started and a flagFr is set Step 532 . The timer Ti is for counting up the time for which the rear height of the vehicle is kept altered.The flag Fr is for determining whether or not the timer T1 should be counting, as shown in Fig. 8 which shows a flow chart indicating a routine which is repeatedly executed in every predetermined time. If the flag Fr is already set Step 810 , the timer T1 is caused to perform incremental counting Step 820 . After the alteration of the rear height of the vehicle Step 530 , the time Tv from the detection of the protrusion of the road surface at the front wheel to the passing of the rear wheel over the protrusion is calculated on the basis of the vehicle speed V as follows Tv A1 V A2 where Al Wheelbase and A2 Compensatory term constant .The compensatory term A2 is determined in consideration of the detection lags of the vehicle height sensors 1 and 2, the time taken for the rear wheels to move over the protrusion of the road surface, etc. The current routine is terminated after that. In the subsequent execution of the routine, the branch toStep 536 is taken by the judgment at Step 526 because the FlagFP is already set by the previous routine. In Step 536, it is judged whether the timer T7 exceeded the time Tv and if this condition is not satisfied, this routine is terminated.Otherwise, i.e., if the rear vehicle height has been lowered for the time Tv, the timer T1 is reset and the flag Fr is also reset Step 538 , which stops the counting of the timer T1 atStep 810 of Fig. 8. Then, it is judged whether a flag FS, whose meaning is explained later, is set Step 540 and if it is not set, the flag FP is judged to be 1 or not Step 542 .If the flag FP is 1, the rear vehicle height is raised to return to the original height to cope with a normal road surface and the flag FP is reset Steps 544, 546 . When it is judged NO at Step 524, i.e., the front wheels do not move up on a definite protrusion, a judgment concerning to a depression of the road surface is executed.It is judged whether or not the difference VHF S VHF CR of the current vehicle height VHF S from the average vehicle height VHF CR is greater than a predetermined value hl Step 522 and if the result is YES it is then judged whether a flag FS is reset Step 554 , which indicates that the front wheels do not fall down in a sinking or depression of a road surface yet. If the flag FS is reset, the flag FS is set Step 556 and the rear vehicle height is raised Step 558 .In operation, the solenoids 751a and 752a are driven to open the leveling valves 151 and 152 and at the same time compressed air is fed to the main air chambers 3b and 4b of the air suspension 3 and 4 from the compressor 200b for a predetermined time t2. With these operations, the downward movement of the rear wheels caused by the sinking which the front wheels detected is compensated to maintain the posture of the running vehicle as unchanged as possible. Then theSteps 532 and 534 are executed to count up the timer T1 and calculated the time Tv, as described before, and the current routine is terminated. In the subsequent execution of the routine, the branch to Step 536 is taken by the judgement atStep 552 because the Flag FS is already set by the previous routine.In Step 536, it is judged whether the timer T1 exceeded the time Tv and if the condition is not satisfied, this routine is terminated. Otherwise, i.e., if the rear vehicle height has been raised for the time Tv, the timer T1 is reset and the flag Fr is also reset Step 538 . Then, since FS is set in this case, YES is taken at Step 540 to proceed to the returning operations of the altered rear vehicle height. The rear vehicle height is lowered Step 560 to return to the original height to cope with a normal road surface and the flag FS is reset Step 562 . In the above processings, each of the opening time tl of the relief solenoid valve 200e and the feeding time t2 from the compressor 200b is predetermined to be a single value. However, they may be determined to be various values in accordance with the size of the protrusion or the depression or they may be dependent on the vehicle speed V, i.e., the lowering operations or the raising operations are continued until the rear wheels pass the protrusion or the depression. For example, in case of passing a depression, the processings shown by the flowchart of Fig. 6 C are started by the setting of the timer T1 and the flag Fr at Step 532 ofFig. 6 B .After the raising operations began Step 622 , the time tl is calculated as A1 V, which means the time for the rear wheels to come to the depression after the front wheels passed it, and when T1 exceeded tl, the raising operations are terminated. For returning the raised rear vehicle height to the original height, the time t7 is not reset at Step 538 in Fig.6 A and instead of the process at Step 560, processings according to the flowchart in Fig. 6 D are executed. After the lowering operations begin Step 662 , T2 is calculated as m tl Step 664 , where m the time for lowering a definite vehicle height the time for raiseing the definite vehicle height When the timer T1 elapsed the time Tv t2, the lowering operations are terminated. Fig. 9 shows a time chart indicating the processings for a case of passing a depression. Before a time point tl shown in Fig. 9, the automobile is running on a flat part of the road surface, the vehicle heightVHF S obtained from the vehicle height sensors 1 and 2 draws waves of small amplitude, and the average vehicle heightVHF CR obtained from the CR filter circuit 305a draws a a i g smoothed form of the waves. When the front wheel begins to move down into the depression of the road surface, the vehicle height VHF S sharply increases.At the time point tl, the vehicle height VHF S exceeds VHF CR hl, in other words, it is judged in Step 552 in the flow chart shown in Fig. 6 A that VHF S VHF CR is greater than hi. At the time point tl, the ECU 300 starts sending out the drive signal for opening the leveling valves 151 and 152 and feeding compressed air to the air suspensions 3 and 4 from the compressor 200b until the time point t2 which is a time tl after the time point tl. By these operations, the rear vehicle height is gradually raiseed and when, at the time point t3, the rear wheels move down in the depression and the rear vehicle height is kept unchanged. Then for the time t2 between the time point t4, which is the time Tv later than the beginning of the operation of the compressor 200b, and t5 the release solenoid valve 200e is opened, returning the vehicle height to the normal state. When the front wheels move up on a protrusions, the timings are same as that described above.
