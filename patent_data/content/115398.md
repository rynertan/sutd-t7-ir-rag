# Organic inorganic composites of neutralized polyelectrolyte complexes.

## Abstract
Neutralized polyelectrolyte complexes exhibiting hydrophobic behavior containing crystals of an organic polycation exchanged lithium and or sodium water swelling mica are made by 1 forming a glass ceramic body containing crystals selected from fluorhectorite, hydroxyl hectorite, boron fluorphlogopite, hydroxyl boron phlogopite, and solid solutions among those and between those and other structurally compatible species selected from talc, fluortalc, polylithionite, fluropolylithionite, phlogopite, and fluorphlogopite 2 contacting that body with a polar liquid to cause swelling and disintegration of the body accompanied with the formation of a gel and 3 contacting said gel with a source of organic polycations to cause a reaction between the Li and or Na ions from the interlayer of the crystals and to neutralize the charge density of the crystals, thereby forming a neutralized polyelectrolyte complex. The complex may be formed into paper, board, film, fiber or coating by dispersion of the complex into a selected liquid and forming the paper, board, film or coating from such dispersion.
