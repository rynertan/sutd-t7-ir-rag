# Method and apparatus for tracking an optically readable information track.

## Abstract
Apparatus, and a related method, for maintaining an inci dent beam of radiation 19 in alignment with the centerline of a movable optically readable information track 13 wherein the track comprises a succession of light reflecting 15 and light scattering 17 regions representative of a frequency modulated carrier and the sides of the track are adapted to scatter incident radiation in predetermined directions. The apparatus includes photodetector means 41,43 for sensing the amount of radiation scattered by each side of the track and for generating an error signal 71 indicative of the devia tion of the incident beam relative to the centerline 51 of the track, along with means 37 responsive to the error signal for controllably moving the incident beam into alignment with the centerline of the track.
