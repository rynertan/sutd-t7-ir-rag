The present silylating reaction is followed by a per se conventional one. The reaction temperature of the silylation is in the range of about 0 to 500C, preferably not higher than 380C, usually a room temperature about 200C , and the reaction time is from several minutes about 10 minutes to about 24 hours. The reaction is conducted conveniently in, for example, ethyl acetate, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, N, N dimethylacetamide, N, N dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, chloroform, benzene, toluene, acetone, methylethylketone, or acetonitrile, or an optional mixture of them, or any other solvent which is inert to this reaction.This reaction can be conducted also in the presence of an inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydrogen carbonate, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate or a trialkylamine suchastriethylamine, tributylamine, tribenzylamine, N methylmorpholine, or N methylpiperidine, an organic tertiary amine such as N,N dialkylaniline, N,N dialkylbenzylamine, pyridine, picoline or lutidine, or an organic base such l,5 diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octane or 1,8 diazabicyclo 5,4,4 undecene 7, and when the base is liquid, it can be used also as a solvent. Thus obtained l t butyl or isopropylsilyl derivative of a compound II , where R2 is a protected amino group, can be led to a l t butyl or isopropylsilyl derivative of a desired compound II by eliminating the protective group, followed by subjecting to acylation at 3 position.This acylation proceeds with good yield, and the process is simple and convenient, thus being very useful for the synthesis of various types of 2 oxoazetidine having a desired acyl group as the substituent. Further, the sulfonation of the next step can be carried out continuously. The elimination of amino protective groups of the l t butyl or isopropyl derivative of compounds II can be effected, according to the type of protective group, by selective application of per se known methods such as 1 a method involving the use of a base, 2 a method involving the use of hydrazine, 3 a method involving the use of thiourea or sodium N methyldithiocarbamate or 4 a method involving reduction. 1 The method involving the use of a base employs such an inorganic base as hydroxides, carbonates or metal alkoxides of alkali metals e.g. sodium or potassium or alkaline earth metals e.g. calcium or magnesium , such an organic base as metal alkoxides e.g. sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, lithium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium t butoxide, lithium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide , organic amine e.g. triethylamine, trimethylamine, tributylamine, N methylmorpholine, N methylpiperidine, N,N dimethylaniline, pyridine, picoline, lutidine , or a quarternary ammonium salt e.g. n butylammonium hydroxide , and a basic ion exchange resin e.g. Amberlite IRA 400 Rohm and Haas Co., U.S.A. , Amberlite IR 45 Rohm andHass Co., U.S.A. , Dowex 1 Dow Chemical Co., U.S.A. ,Dowex 2 Dow Chemical Co., U.S.A. .The method may be carried out in the presence of a solvent such as hydrophilic organic solvent e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, N, N dimethylformamide, N, N dimethyl acetamide, dimethylsulfoxide, acetone, acetonitrile, nitromethane , water, or a mixed solvent thereof. The reaction temperature is normally about 0 to 300C, preferably about 0 to 200C. 2 In the method involving the use of hydrazine, hydrazine or N methylhydrazine is employed, and the reaction may be carried out in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diethylether, chloroform, dichloromethane, ester e.g. ethyl acetate , acetone, methanol, ethanol, benzene, toluene, N,N dimethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulfoxide, and the reaction temperature is about 0 to 300C, preferably 0 to 200C, and the reaction time is about one to 24 hours. 3 In the method involving the use of thiourea, it is carried out by employing, thiourea under mild reaction conditions so as to remove halogenoacetyl group seeJournal of the American Chemical Society 90, 4508 1968 Journal of the Chemical Society 1915, 5015 . In the method involving the use of sodium N methyldithiocarbamate, it is used about 1 equivalent to small excess amount of sodium N methyldithiocarbamate relative to the starting material, the reaction is carried out in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, diethylether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, chloroform, dichloromethane, and the reaction is carried out normally at about room temperature about 200C and may be carried out under cooling about 200C or under warming about 400C . 4 The reductive method employs, according to the type of protective group and other conditions, a metal e.g.tin, zinc, etc. or a metal compound e.g. chromous chloride, chromous acetate, etc. together with an acid such as an organic acid e.g. acetic acid or propionic acid, or involves the use of a metal catalyst for catalytic reduction. The catalyst used for such catalytic reduction may for example be platinum catalysts e.g. platinum wire, platinum sponge, platinum black, platinum oxide, colloidal platinum,etc. , palladium catalysts e.g. palladium sponge, palladium black, palladium oxide, palladium barium sulfate, palladium barium carbonate, palladium carbon, palladiumsilica gel, colloidal palladium, etc. , reduced nickel, nickel oxide, Raney nickel, Urushihara nickel, etc. The reductive method is usually conducted in a solvent. The method involving the use of a metal and an acid is usually carried out in the presence of water, acetone or the like. In the catalytic reduction method, for instance, the reaction is conducted usually in the presence of an alcohol e.g. metnanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropyl alcohol, etc. , ethyl acetate, etc. The reaction temperature is not particularly critical, but may be selected suitably depending on the type of protecting groups or kinds of methods of eliminating the protective groups, and, preferably, mild conditions, i.e., ranging from under cooling about OOC to under warming about 400C . The compound II , in which the amino group at 1position is acylated, can be produced by subjecting thusobtained 3 amino compound i.e. l t butyl or isopropyl derivative of the compound III wherein R2 is amino group to acylation by the use of a desired acylating agent, for example, an organic carboxylic acid containing an acyl group represented by R2 or a reactive derivative thereof, for example, acid anhydrides, activated amides or activated esters described as follows 1 Acid anhydrides The acid anhydrides include, among others, mixed anhydrides with a hydrogen halide e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid , with a monoalkyl carbonate, with an aliphatic carboxylic acid e.g. acetic, pivalic, valeric isopentanoic or trichloroacetic acid or with an aromatic carboxylic acid e.g. benzoic acid , and symmetric acid anhydrides.2 Activated amides The activated amides include amides with pyrazole, imidazole, 4 substituted imidazole, dimethylpyrazole, benzotriazole, etc.3 Activated esters The activated esters include, among others, such esters as methyl, ethyl, methoxymethyl, propargyl, 4nitrophenyl, 2,4 dinitrophenyl, trichlorophenyl, penta chlorophenyl and mesylphenyl esters as well as esters of sucn acids as the above mentioned carboxylic acid with l hydroxy lH 2 pyridone, N hydroxy 5 norbornene 2,3dicarboximide, l hydroxybenzotriazole, N hydroxysuccinimide and N hydroxyphthalimide. Appropriate reactive derivatives of organic acids are selected from among such ones as mentioned above depending on the type of the acid used. When a free acid is used as the acylating agent, the reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a condensing agent. Examples of the condensing agent are N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, N cyclohexyl N morpholinoethylcarbodiimide, N cyclohexyl N 4 diethylaminocyclohexyl carbodiimide and N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide, pentamethyleneketeneN cyclohexylimine, trialkyl phosphite, thionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride, triphenylphosphine, N ethylbenzoisoxazolium salt, or Vilsmeyer reagent. The acylation is usually carried out in a solvent.The solvent includes, for example, water, acetone, dioxane, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, chloroform, dichloroethane, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, dimethylformamide, pyridine and other common organic solvents inert to the reaction.Among these, hydrophilic solvents may be used as mixtures with water. The acylation may be carried out in the presence of an inorganic base, such as alkalimetal, or in the presence of an organic base such as an trialkylamine as trimethylamine, triethylamine, tributylamine, N methylmorpholine orN methylpiperidine or such an organic tertiary amine as N,N dialkylaniline, N,N dialkylbenzylamine, pyridine, picoline or lutidine, or such an organic base as 1,5 diazabicyclo 4,3,0 non 5 ene, 1,4 diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octane or 1,8 diazabicyclo 5,4,4 undecene 7. When the organic base or the above mentioned condensing agent is a liquid, it may also serve as a solvent. The reaction temperature is not critical, but the reaction is mostly carried out under cooling about OOC to about 300C. In acylation reaction the acylating agent contains at least one asymmetric carbon atom, the respective stereoisomers alone as well as mixtures thereof can be subjected to the acylation. When the acylation product is a mixture of corresponding isomers, the individual isomers can be isolated as necessary by a conventional method, such as column chromatography or recrystallization. The reaction step of this invention is to subject a l t butyl or isopropylsilyl derivative of a compound II to sulfonation to give a l sulfo 2 oxoazetidine derivative I , and this reaction is conducted by bringing a l tbutyl or isopropylsilyl derivative of the compound II into contact with sulfuric anhydride or a reactive derivative of sulfuric anhydride. The reactive derivative of sulfuric anhydride is for example, sulfuric anhydride pyridine, sulfuric anhydride N,N dimethylformamide, sulfuric anhydride dioxane, sulfuric anhydride trimethylamine or sulfuric anhydride chlorosulfonic acid adduct. In the above reaction, sulfuric anhydride or a reactive derivative thereof is added in an amount of about 1 to about 5 moles, preferably about 1 to about 2 moles, per mole of a l t butyl or isopropylsilyl derivative of the compound II . The reaction temperature is about OOC to about 800C, preferably about lO0C to about 400C. A solvent may be used in the above reaction. Usable solvents include ethers such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether, esters such as ethyl acetate and ethyl formate, halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform and methylene chloride, hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and n hexane, amides such as dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide, and other usual organic solvents, alone or in combination. It is believed that the present sulfonation proceeds through the following route EMI30.1 In said formulas, X and R2 are of the same meaning as defined above. t Bu stands for t butyl.After the reaction, the compounds I can be recovered in any desired purity by subjecting silyl compound to decomposition or the reaction mixture to a purification separation procedure known per se, such as solvent extraction, recrystallization and or chromatography. The compounds I having protective groups are valuable as intermediates for thesynthesis of useful medicines and, for example, can be converted to unprotected compounds I by elimination of theprotective groups. The elimination of protective groups from azetidine derivatives I having protective groups can be effected by selective application of a per se conventional methods such as 1 a method involving the use of an acid, 2 a method involving the use of an iminohalogenating agent and then of an iminoetherifying agent, followed by, upon necessity, hydrolysis, 3 a method involving the use of a base, 4 a method involving the use of thiourea or sodium N methyldithiocarbamate, 5 a method involving the use of hydrazine or 6 a method involving reduction. 1 In the method involving the use of an acid, it employs, depending on the type of protective group and other conditions, such an inorganic acid as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, etc., such an organic acid as formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, etc., acidic ion exchange resins e.g. Amberlite IR 120 Rohm andHaas Co., U.S.A. , Amberlite IRC 50 Rohm and Haas Co.,U.S.A. , Dowex 50W Dow Chemical Co., U.S.A. ,and when necessity requires, a hydrophilic organic solvent e.g.methanol, ethanol, propanol, acetone, acetonitrile, nitromethane, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, N ,N dimethylformamide,N,N dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulfoxide , water or a mixed solvent thereof. The reaction temperature is about 0 to 300C, preferably about 0 to 200C. 2 As the iminohalogenating agent to be used in the method of eliminating protective groups by using an iminohalogenating agent and then an iminoetherifying agent followed by, when necessary, hydrolysis, there may be used, for example, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus tribromide, phosphorus pentabromide, phosphorus oxychloride, thionyl chloride, phosgene, etc.The reaction temperature is not critical, but the reaction is mostly carried out under cooling about 200C or at room temperature about 200C . As an iminoetherifying agent to be reacted with thusobtained reaction product, alcohols or metal alkoxides are used. The alcohols include alkanols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, n butanol, tert butanol, etc. as well as those compounds in which the alkyl moieties of the above mentioned alcohols are substituted with an alkoxy group such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy or the like. The metal alkoxides include alkali metal alkoxides such as sodium alkoxides, potassium alkoxides, etc. and alkaline earthmetalalkoxides such as calcium alkoxides, barium alkoxides, etc. derived from such alcohols as above. The reaction temperature is not critical, but the reaction is mostly carried out at about 50 to 300C, preferably 20 to 200C. These methods, i.e. 3 the method involving the use of a base, 4 the method involving the use of thiourea or sodium N methyldithiocarbamate, 5 the method invovling the use of hydrazine and 6 the method involving reduction, are carried out by employing the corresponding methods mentioned in the method of removing the protective group of the amino group of l t butyl or isopropylsilyl derivative of the compound II . The compounds I from which the protective groups are removed can be led to desired salts such as addition salts with an inorganic acid exemplified by hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid, or an organic acid exemplified by acetic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, mandelic acid, citric acid and tartaric acid. Having a sulfo group, the compounds I can in general form salts with bases. Therefore, the compounds I may be recovered in the form of salts, and the salts recovered may be converted to the free form or to other salts. Furthermore, the compounds I obtained in the free form may be converted to salts. The above mentioned bases are, for example, inorganic bases, such as lithium, potassium, sodium, calcium and ammonia, and organic bases, such as pyridine, colidine, triethylamine and triethanolamine. When the compounds I have free amino groups or carboxyl groups, they can respectively be recovered in the form of addition salts with such inorganic acids as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid and such organic acids as formic acid, acetic acid or p toluene sulfonic acid, or in the form of salts with the abovementioned bases. According to the circumstances, the compounds I may involve stereoisomers e.g. D isomer, L isomer . These individual isomers as well as mixture thereof can be used as medicines. When a mixture of such isomers is obtained,each isomer can be isolated as necessary by a conventional method of optical resolution. The compounds I are all in a stable powdery form, which are substantially tasteless, odorless and low toxicity, thus being useful as medicines. For example, they have antibacterial activity against certain kinds of Grampositive bacteria e.g. Staphylococcus aureus and Gramnegative bacteria e.g. Escherichia coli and have S lactamase inhibitory activity against ss lactamase which is produced by a resistant bacteria. The compounds I can be used as therapeutic or prophylactic agents for bacterial infections in humans or domestic animals e.g. mouse, rat, etc. , singly or in combination with ss lactam antibiotics. The compounds I can be prepared into, for example, injections, dry syrups, granules, tablets or capsules, by per se conventional manner, but, preferably, they are used as injections in the form of their salts or hydrates. The daily dose is, for example, generally about 50 1000 mg for an adult human, usually 100 75Q mg per day in 2 4 divided doses. Among the starting compound II , those in which X stands for hydrogen can be prepared by a similar manner to those described in British Patent No. 1,519,495. The starting compound II , including the cases whereX stands for hydrogen and methoxy, can be prepared by, for example, subjecting a compound represented by the formula III EMI34.1 wherein X and R2 have the same meaning as defined above, and R21 stands for ester residue, to oxidation with for example, ozone, alkali metal permanganate e.g. potassium permanganate, sodium permanganate , alkaline earth metal permanganate e.g. barium permanganate , osmium tetroxide, lead tetracetate, etc. in tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, N,Ndimethylformamide, N ,N dimethylacetamide, benzene, acetone, pyridine, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, water, chloroform, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride or an optional mixture of them. The ester residue R21 of the formula III includes, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, t butyl, pentyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, benzyl, pnitrobenzyl, benzhydryl, alkoxyalkyl, alkanoyloxymethyl, alkenyl, trichloroethyl, methylsulfonylethyl, benzoylmethyl, methoxybenzyl, trityl, methylthiomethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, a acetoxybutyl, etc. Among the compounds III , those in which X is methoxy can be prepared by allowing the compound III in which X is hydrogen to react with methylate of lithium, sodium or potassium in the presence of methanol and with a halogenating agent such as a halogen e.g. chlorine or bromine , anN haloimide e.g. N chlorosuccinimide or N bromosuccinimide , a haloamide e.g. N chloroacetamide or N bromoacetamide , an N halosulfonamide e.g. N chlorobenzenesulfonamide orN chloro p toluenesulfoamide , a l halobenzotriazole, or an organic hypochloride e.g. t butylhypochloride , in, for example, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, methylene chloride, chloroform, acetonitrile , methanbl, N, N dimethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide or an optional mixture of them. More precisely, the starting compound IV is produced by, for example, the following procedures.Procedure 1 EMI35.1 Procedure 2 EMI36.1 Procedure 3 EMI36.2 Regarding the symbols used in the above reaction formula,R2 has the same meaning as defined hereinbefore R21 is an ester residue and R22 is athiolresidue. Exemplary species of the members defined in the above definitions are as follows. The ester residue R21 is of the same groups as mentioned above. The thiol residue R22 include, for example, alkyl groups e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, t butyl, isobutyl, n amyl, vinyl, l isopropenyl, etc. , substituted alkyl groups e.g. methoxymethyl, ethoxymethyl, benzyl, phenethyl, xylylmethyl, p chlorobenzyl, p nitrobenzyl, p methoxybenzyl, etc. , unsubstituted and substitued aryl groups e.g. phenyl, xylyl, tolyl, naphthyl, chlorophenyl, nitrophenyl, methoxyphenyl, etc. , heterocyclic groups e.g.benzothiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, thiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, oxazolyl, thienyl, pyridyl, oxadiazolyl, oxatriazolyl, imidazolyl, benzimidazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, etc. , acyl groups e.g. acetyl, propionyl, benzoyl, thioacetyl, thiopropionyl, thiobenzoyl, etc. , carbamoyl groups e.g.methylcarbamoyl, dimethylcarbamoyl, phenylcarbamoyl, etc. , the corresponding and other thiocarbamoyl groups, and groups of the formula EMI37.1 The above mentioned procedures for producing the azetidine derivative gI will be described in detail.Proceudre 1 This method is related to a fundamental synthetic method for optically active azetidine derivatives II . The compound V used as a starting material can be easily prepared, for example by the method described inJournal of the American Chemical Society 95, 2401 1973 or a method analogous thereto. In the first stage, compound V is reacted with a disulfidizing agent. The term disulfidizing agent is used herein to include all the reactants that are capable of disulfidizing the sulfur in l position of compound V and, in particular, thiol compounds of the formula R5 SH and disulfides of the formula R22 S S R22 R22 has the same meaning as defined hereinbefore . This reaction is carried out the absence of a solvent or in an appropriate solvent. The solvent includes, for example, dioxane, N, N dimethylacetamide, N,N dimethylformamide, benzene, toluene, tert butanol, isopropanol, methyl ethyl ketone, etc., mixtures of such solvents, and other solvents which will not interfere with the reaction.While the reaction temperature is not particularly critical, it is normally advantageous to carry out the reaction at a temperature between 70 C and 1500C. When a disulfide compound of R22 S S R22 is employed as said disulfidizing agent, the reaction is catalytically accelerated by the presence of an acid or a base. This acid includes, for example, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid and other mineral acids, p toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, phenylphosphonic acid, acetic acid, formic acid and other organic acids, andLewis acids such as ferric chloride, zinc chloride, boron trifluoride, etc. When such an acid is employed, there is predominantly obtained a 1 a isopropenyl azetidine VI which contains a double bond in exo position. The base mentioned above includes, for example, pyridine, quinoline,N,N dimethylaniline, triethylamine, etc. In this case, dependingonthe reaction solvent, time, temperature, etc., there is obtained a l a isopropylidene azetidine VII having a double bond in endo position in addition to the 1 2 isopropenyl azetidine VI . This 1 a isopropylidene azetidine VII can also be easily obtained by treating 1 2 isopropenyl azetidine VI with a base. The reaction according to this procedure is preferably carried out in streams of an inert gas such as nitrogen, helium or the like. The useful molar ratio of disulfidizing agent to starting compound V depends on the S nucleophilicity of the disulfidizing agent used but, generally speaking, about 1 to about 10 equivalents of said agent are employed.After completion of the reaction, the product compound VI can be isolated in optional purity by the purification procedures known per se, e.g. extraction with solvents, recrystallization, chromatography, etc. The compound VI , on treatment with a base, yields the compound VII . The base used for this purpose may be the above mentioned base which can be used as a catalyst in the reaction between compound VI and disulfidizing agent. In carrying out this reaction, the base need not be employed in a large amount. Thus, relative to compound VI , about 0.01 to about 0,2 mol equivalent is sufficient. The reaction is generally carried out in a solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform, benzene, toluene, tert butanol, methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, methyl ethyl ketone, N ,N dimethylacetamide, N ,N dimethylformamide, etc.or a mixture of such solvents. Any other solvent that will not interfere with the reaction may also be employed. While the reaction temperature is not particularly critical, the reaction proceeds at room temperature in many instances.The product derivative VII in which R22 is a group of the formula EMI39.1 is a compound which is obtained simultaneously or partially in this reaction step and can be converted to compound VIII by treatment with a reducing agent. Then, compound VII is subjected to a reductive desulfurization reaction. The reductive desulfurizing agent used for this purpose may, for example, by Raney nickel, Raney cobalt or the like. This reaction is usually carried out in a solvent. The solvent includes, for example, methanol, ethanol, propanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethyl acetate, water, etc., although other common organic solvents which do not interfere with the reaction may also be employed. This reaction proceeds readily under mild conditions, e.g. at room temperature to about 80 C. The compound VIII is then oxidized in order to remove the N side chain. This oxidation reaction includes an oxidization reaction with an oxidizing agent and a subsequent solvolysis with a solvent or a basic or acidic catalyst. The oxidizing agent use in the above oxidation reaction includes, for example, ozone, alkali metal permanganate e.g. potassium permanganate, sodium permanganate, etc. , alkaline earth metal permanganate e.g. barium permanganate, etc. , osmium tetraoxide, lead tetraacetate, etc. This oxidation reaction is usually carried out in a solvent.This solvent includes, for example, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, N,N dimethylformamide, N ,N dimethylacetamide, benzene, acetone, pyridine, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, water, chloroform, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, etc. It may be a mixture of such solvents. The prdportion of the oxidizing agent relative to compound VIII may be about 1.0 to 4.0 molar equivalents, preferably about 1.0 to 1.2 molar equivalents, although excess ozone if it is used may be employed. While the reaction temperature is not particularly critical, the reaction usually proceeds under cooling or at room temperature.The reaction normally goes to completion with a short time.When a permanganate, for instance, is employed as the oxidizing agent, it is preferable to employ in a buffer solution such as phosphate buffer and carry out the reaction in the neutral pH region so as to minimize the decomposition of starting compound VI or and product compound I . When ozone is used as said oxidizing agent, the conversion of compound VIII to compound IX can be effected by ozonolysis e.g. by carrying out the reaction in a solvent such as chloroform, dichloromethane or carbon tetrachloride, followed by removing the excess ozone and decomposing the ozonide of compound VIII with dimethyl sulfide. The conversion of compound IX to compound II is effected by subjecting compound IX to solvolysis. This reaction is carried out in a suitable solvent and may be optionally conducted with the aid of a basic or acidic catalyst. The base used in such a procedure includes, for instance, inorganic bases such as the hydroxides, carbonates, etc. of alkali metals such as lithium, potassium sodium, etc. or alkaline earth metals such as calcium, magnesium, etc. organic bases such as metal alkoxides, organic amines,quarternary ammonium salts, etc. basic ion exchange resins and so forth.The acid used in a similar manner includes inorganic acids and their salts such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phophoric acid, zinc chloride, zinc sulfate, ferric chloride, ferric sulfate, etc., organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, etc., silica gel, acidic ion exchange resins and so forth. The solvent used for this reaction includes, for example, water, methanol, ethanol, propanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethyl acetate, etc. as well as mixtures thereof. Any other solvent that will not interfere with the reaction may also be employed likewise.This reaction usually proceeds easily under mild conditions, e.g. under cooling to a slightly elevated temperature. The reaction product in each step can be separated in optional purity by purification procedure konwn per se, e.g.extraction with solvents, recrystallization, chromatography, etc.Procedre 2 This procedure relates to a fundamental route of synthesis for the production of optically inactive azetidine derivative II . The starting compound X can be easily prepared by the method described in Molecular Modification in Drug Design 45, 15 1964 or a method analogous thereto. The methoxylation reaction of compound X to compound VIII is carried out by reacting an alkali metal salt of methanol, which is of the formula MOCH3 wherein M is an alkali metal , and a halogenating agent with the compound X in the presence of methanol. As examples of the alkali metal salt of methanol may be mentioned lithium methoxide, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, etc.The halogenating agent is a halogen compound capable of acting as a positive halogen donor, e.g. halogen chlorine, bromine, etc. , N haloimides N chlorosuccinimide, Nbromosuccinimide, etc. , haloamides N chloroacetamide, Nbromoacetamide, etc. , N halosulfonamides N chlorobenzenesulfonamide, N chloro p toluenesulfonamide, etc. , 1halobenzotriazoles, organic hypochlorite, etc. . This reaction is carried out in a solvent. Examples of the solvent include tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dichloromethane, chloroform, acetonitrile, methanol, N ,N dimethylformamide,N,N dimethylacetamide, etc. as well as various mixtures thereof. Any other solvent that will not interfere with the contemplated reaction may likewise be employed.To carry out the reaction, the starting compound X is dissolved or suspended in the above mentioned solvent and, then, the alkali metal salt of methanol, methanol and halogenating agent are added. The desirable proportions of these agents, relative to each mol of starting compound X , are not less than 1 mol of methanol, about 1 to 3.5 moles of the alkali metal salt of methanol and about 1 to 2 mols of halogenating agent. The reaction proceeds readily under cooling or at room temperature to about 300C. The reaction can be quenched by making the reaction system acidic. The suitable acid to quench the reaction may for example be formic acid, acetic acid or trichloroacetic acid. After the reaction has thus been quenched, any ess halogenating agent can be removed by treatment wit a Lec31lcing agent such as sodium thiosulfate or a trialkTy phosphite, for instance. After completion of the above reaction, the product compound VIII can be isolated in an optional purity by conventional separatoin purification procedures, for example by extraction with a solvent, recrystallization, chromatography, etc. The compound VIII is then subjected to procedures similar to the oxidation procedures described hereinbefore in connection with the conversion of compound VIII to compound II , whereby an optically inactive form of compound II is obtained.Proceudre 3 In this procedure, the compound X obtained for example by the method described in Molecular Modification in Drug Design 45, 15 1964 or a method analogous thereto is oxidized to compound II . This oxidation reaction can be effected by procedures similar to those used in the conversion of compound VIII to compound II according to the above procedure 1 . The present method of preparing l sulfo 2 oxoazetidine derivatives is of industrial advantage in that 1 the intermediate, i.e. a l t butyl or iSopropylsilyl derivative of the compound II , can be recovered in a stable state, and it can be used advantageously as a starting material in the next reaction step, 2 the protective group or the acyl group of the intermediate, i.e. l t butyl or isopropylsilyl derivative of the compound II , can be easily replaced by some other kind of acyl group, 3 the desired compounds, i.e. l sulfo 2 oxoazetidine derivatives, can be produced in a remarkably high yield, because the sulfonation is easily carried out by employing a highly purified starting material, i.e. a l t butyl or isopropylsilyl derivative of the compound II , 4 even when the starting material, i.e. compound II , has methoxy group at 3position, the present method can introduce sulfo group to l position of azetidine compound without causing adverse effect on the methoxy group.
