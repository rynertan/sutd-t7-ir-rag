# Photosensitive material for electrophotography.

## Abstract
A photosensitive material for electrophotography is provided which has a very high sensitivity to rays having a wavelength included in the oscillation wavelength region of a laser printer, especially a semiconductor laser printer, and which also has a high charge potential. This photo sensitive material comprises a phthalocyanine pigment, poly N vinylcarbazole, and an organic resin in which said phthalo cyanine pigment and poly N vinylcarbazole are dispersed, wherein the weight ratio of phthalocyanine pigment to poly N vinylcarbazole is in the range of from 1.2 to 12 and the content of the organic resin is 35 to 70 by weight based on the total amount of the photosensitive material.
