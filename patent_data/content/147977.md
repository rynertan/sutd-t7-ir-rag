# NOVEL ANODES FOR CATHODIC PROTECTION

## Abstract
Novel anodes for cathodic protection systems comprise a plurality of elongate strands which are joined together to form an open flexible mesh. At least some of the strands are electrically conductive and comprise carbonaceous material which provides at least part of the electrochemically active surface of the anode. For example, the strands can consist of or contain carbon fibers and or conductive polymer ele ments. The novel anodes are particularly useful for the cathodic protection of reinforcing bars in concrete structures.
