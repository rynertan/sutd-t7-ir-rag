# A gas liquid reactor and a method for reacting liquids and gasses.

## Abstract
A gas liquid reactor 100, 300 comprising an outside con tainment vessel 102, 302 and an inside reaction vessel rotatably supported within the outside containment vessel 104, 304 . A liquid is conducted into the inside reaction vessel 104, 304 , and that vessel 104, 304 is rotated to force the liquid therein against a wall of the reaction vessel 104, 304 and into a film having stable and geometrically simple shape. A gas is also conducted into the inside reaction vessel 104, 304 to react with the liquid therein. Because of the stable and simple shape of the liquid, the reactions between the liquid and gases are relatively easy to analyze mathematically.
