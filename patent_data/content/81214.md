# Guide apparatus.

## Abstract
A guide apparatus comprises annular rail means 24 and means 27, 28, 29 for attaching the annular rail means onto a cylindrical member 19 to be inspected by a inspecting means on the rail means. The attaching means is provided on the rail means and includes at least two radially stationary jaw means 28, 29 and at least one radially movable jaw means 27 . Each of the radially stationary jaw means has a jaw surface to be abutted on an outer periphery of the cylindrical member. A radial distance between the abutting surface of the radially stationary jaw means and the inner peripheral surface of the radial means is discontinuously variable.
