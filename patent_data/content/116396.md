# ELECTRICAL ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
An electrical assembly incorporates a multilayer printed circuit board comprising a flexible electrically insulating circuit board laminate 1 with electrical conductors 2 for connecting to terminals 3 on rigid slab like heat dissipating components such as circuit or component packages or carriers 4 . A separate rigid metallic heat sinking or spread ing plate 16 is applied, having protruding thermally con ducting pillars 17 passing through holes 15 in the circuit board laminate 1 to contact the components 4 . A further rigid plate 8, 18, 28, 38 overlies the components 4 and is clamped by clips 9,11 or bolts 31 to plate 16 . Compliant means 10, 20, 30, 40 such as springs of deformable and elastic rubber or plastics material is provided intermediate the further plate 8, 18, 28, 38 and the top of the components 4 to accommodate difference in height or thickness be tween the components 4 while transmitting pressure from the further plate 8, 18, 28, 38 to the top of the component 4 to ensure contact between the components 4 and the pillars 17 on the heat sinking or spreading plate 16 .
