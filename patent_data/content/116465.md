# Colour cathode ray tube.

## Abstract
The tube has an in line electron gun directing three electron beams through a shadow mask on to the phosphor screen. In order to improve coincidence of the three rasters by reducing coma distortion a shield cup 20 is fitted over the end of the electron gun and has apertures 22, 23, 24 in the bottom 21 of the cup for the three beams. High permeability magnetic members may be arranged on the cup bottom 21 to act as field control members. In order to avoid mis convergence due to coma distortion even at high deflection frequencies the present invention provides narrow cuts 25 radiating from the apertures 23, 24 for the outside electron beams. Cuts may also be provided in field control members round these apertures.
