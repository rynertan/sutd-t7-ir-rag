# CATHODE RAY TUBE.

## Abstract
A cathode ray tube having a black matrix phosphor screen. The cathode ray tube 1 has a film 4 composed chiefly of aluminum oxide which covers a carbon layer 3 of black matrix formed on the inner surface of a face plate 2 . Phosphor layers 5R , 5G , 5B are formed on the film 4 . Therefore, th carbon layer, being very thin, does not burn white even in the step of baking. There is obtained a highly fine black matrix phosphor screen 6 , making it possible to provide a very fine black matrix color cathode ray tube of good quality.
