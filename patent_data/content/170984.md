# DROP DETECTING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A drop detecting system has light emitting diodes and phototransistors located on either side of a translucent drip chamber. The phototransistors respond to either the shadow or the reflection from a drop falling through a light beam pro duced by the light emitting diodes. The electrical response from the phototransistors is conducted to an integrator circuit which generates an electrical signal voltage. A comparator cir cuit receives the electrical signal voltage from the integrator circuit and outputs a signal indicating the presence of a drop passing through the drip chamber. A drip chamber housing cooperates with the drip chamber to shroud the translucent portion of the drip chamber. Additionally the drip chamber housing provides for the mounting of the light emitting diodes and the phototransistors.
