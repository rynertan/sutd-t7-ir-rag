# PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF NITROPHENYLHYDROXYACETYLENE AND CONVERSION TO NITROPHENYLACETYLENE

## Abstract
Nitrophenylacetylene and certain precursors to nitrophenylacetylene are prepared by reacting a nitrobromobenzene with a substituted terminal acetylene compound containing at least three carbon atoms and a hydroxy group on the carbon atom adjacent to the acetylene group in the presence of a dialkyl or trialkyl amine solvent and a catalyst system consisting of a palladium complex containing two halogen moities and two tri substituted phosphine moieties. A cuprous iodide promoter is also employed in the reaction sequence.
