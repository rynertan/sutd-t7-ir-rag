# Separation and recovery of carbon monoxide and unsaturated hydrocarbons by copper I complexes.

## Abstract
Carbon monoxide, alkenes, alkynes or mixtures thereof are removed from feedstreams by a process which comprises contacting the feedstream with a solution of a cuprous fluor inated acetylacetonate in an organic solvent containing stabilizing agent to remove carbon monoxide, alkene, alkyne or mixture thereof by forming a first cuprous complex, decomposing the first cuprous complex whereby stabilizing agent replaces carbon monoxide alkene, or alkyne in the first cuprous complex to form a second cuprous complex, and separating the displaced component. The formation of the second cuprous complex avoids any deposition of copper metal upon heating.
