# Method of preserving organ and apparatus for preserving the same.

## Abstract
A method of preserving an organ which comprises first perfusing step of injecting blood uniformly perfusing cho line from an artery or portal vein of the excised organ while gradually lowering its temperature and exhausting it from the vein continuing until the liquid is lowered to the first proximity lowering temperature before its solidifying tem perature, second perfusing step of perfusing refrigerating defect preventing dimethyl sulfoxide or glycerin instead of the blood uniformly perfusing liquid while gradually lower ing its temperature from the first proximity lowering tempe rature continuing until the agent becomes the second prox imity lowering temperature before its solidifying tempera ture, third perfusing step of perfusing the final perfusing li quid of low solidifying temperature lower than alcohol or ether instead of the agent while gradually lowering the li quid form the second proximity lowering temperature conti nuing until the liquid becomes the third proximity lowering temperature before its solidifying temperature, or until the liquid is frozen.
