## Description
VESICLE STABILIZATION SPECIFICATION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The present invention relates to vesicle stabilization, and more particularly to such stabilization by suspending micellular particles such as vesicles in a polymeric gel matrix.Description of Prior Art The use of micellular particles such as phospholipid vesicles or lipisomes as they are commonly referred to as carriers for pharmaceutical and diagnostic agents has been the subject of extensive investigation, Ryman B.E., et al., Ann.N.Y. Acad. Sci., 308, 281 1978 Gregoriadis, G., Ed., wLiposome Technology , CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, Florida, Vol. II 1984 Fendler J.H., Acc. Chem. Res., 13, 7 1980 and Weinstein J.N., et al., Science, 204, 188 1979 . Examples of the potential application of phospholipid vesicles include consideration as carriers of enzymes, drugs particularly anti tumor drugs , chelating agents, hormones, radionuclides, cell modifying substances, antigens antibodies, interferon inducers, and virus subunit particles.However, lipisomes especially small sonicated vesicles are thermodynamically unstable at temperatures below the phase transition temperature, and tend to aggregate or fuse, to form larger unilamellar vesicles on long tern storage, Sheetz M.P., et al., Biochemistry, ll, 4573 1972 Lawaczeck R.L., et al., Biochem, Biophys. Acta, 443, 313 1976 Larrabee H.L., Biochemistry, 18, 3321 1978 and Shullery S.E., et al., Biochemistry, 19, 3919 1980 . Aggregation or fusion of the small particles into larger particles alters the properties of the vesicles, which can in turn sLdify the permeability of the vesicles and in vivo biodistribution, Kao Y.J., et al., Biochem. Biophys.Acta., 677, 453 1981 and Abra R.., et al., Biochem. Biophys.Acta., 666, 493 1981 . It is accordingly highly important to be able to store nicellular particles without having the particles aggregate or fuse together with the resultant potential change in important properties. SUMMARY OF TEE INVENTION According to the present invention, the foregoing aggregation or fusion is overcome by the storage of micellular particles in a polymeric gel matrix. The matrix may be a natural or synthetic matrix that will gel at low temperatures and capable of becoming fluid, as by melting at room temperature or a higher temperature. Examples of suitable such materials are polysaccharides and polypeptides. Upon storage at colder temperatures, the gel solidifies and restricts the motion of the particles. In turn, this slows down or prevents aggregation or fusion. Thus, the size and properties of the micellular particles remain the same size throughout storage and as long as the gel remains in its solidified state. However, at room temperature or higher, the gel will melt and the vesicle or other particle will return to its original form as a suspension in an aqueous medium which can be used for injection or other application in the same manner as freshly prepared vesicles, without alteration of significant properties or in vivo biodistribution. Examples of vesicles to which the present invention is applicable are phospholipids such as distearoylphosphatidylcholine DSPC , dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine DPPC , and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine DMPC and natural phospholipids such as egg lecithin and soybean lecithin. The vesicles may also have enclosed therein a therapeutic agent such as an antibiotic and, as will be shown from the illustrative examples which follow, the vesicles may be labelled after storage with a radionuclide such as 1111n. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONDefinitions and Abbreviations As used herein, micellular particles and micelles refer to particles resulting from aggregations of amphiphillic molecules, with preferred amphiphiles being biological lipids. Vesicle refers to a micelle in a generally sperical form, often obtained from a lipid which forms a bilayered membrane and is referred to as a liposome . Methods for forming such vesicles are well known in the art typically, the vesicles are prepared from a phospholipid, for example, distearoylphosphatidylcholine or lecithin, and may include other materials such as neutral lipids and surface modifiers such as positively or negatively charged compounds, antigens, antibodies, saccharides and lectins. Depending on the techniques for preparation, the vesicle may be a simple bilayered spherical shell a unilamellar vesicle or may have multiple layers moltilamellar vesicles .DSPC distearoylphosphatidyIcholineChol cholesterolDPPC dipalzaitoylphosphatidycholine DMPC dimyristoylphosphatidylcholineDTPA diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid EDTA ethylenedininetetrucetic acidSUV small unilamellar vesicles Material and Method of Preparation of Micelles L distearoylphosphatidylcholine DSPC from Calbiochem and cholesterol Chol from Sigma were used without further purification. Cholesterol oleate Oleate 1 14C Specific activity 51 Ci mole and 14C ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid Acetic 2 14C EDTA specific activity 4.38 mCi mmole were pur chased from New England Nuclear.Sodium salt of nitrilotriacetic acid NTA and EDTA were purchased from Baker Chemical Company. Radiochemical 111 InCi3 research grade was purchased from Nedi Physic and used without purification. lonophone A23187 was purchased from Calbiochem. Agarose Type IX was obtained from Sigma and gelatin Knox gelatin was purchased commercially.Agarose is the neutral gelling fraction of the polysaccharide complex, Agar, extracted from the agarocytes of algae of theRhodophycae, while gelatin is a heterogenous mixture of water soluble, high molecular weight proteins derived from collagen.BDFl mice were obtained from Simonson Laboratories Gilroy, CA .Preparation and Loading of Vesicles Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared and loaded according to the method of Mauk and colleagues, Mauk M.R. BR Gamble R.C., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 76, 765 1979 .Briefly, a lipid mixture was prepared by mixing DSPC, Chol, and A23187 in the molar ratio of 2 1 0.004. The lipid mixture was dried on the vaccum overnight and then sonicated in phosphate buffered saline PBS, pH 7.4 containing lmM NTA or as otherwise specified. 14C or 3H cholesterol oleate was included as a marker for the lipid phase. After sonication, annealing and low speed centrifugation, the vesicles were separated from excess NTA by passing over a Sephadex G 5Q column equilibrated with PtS. Vesicles were loaded with 111InCl3 by adding the radionuclide to the vesicle preparation and incubating at 80 C for 45 minutes. After incubation, excess EDTA was added to complex with free 1111n on the surface of the vesicle or in the folution. These free 1111n EDTA complex were then separated from loaded vesicles by column chromatography usingSephadex G 50. Dynamic light scattering measurements Vesicle size is measured by dynamic light scattering which is concerned with the time behavior of the fluctuations in the scattering intensity, Frokjaer S., et al., Alfred Benzoin Symp., 17, 384 1982 . As the particles undergo continuous Brownian motion, the scattering intensity undergoes a large fluctuation from zero total destructive interference to a maximum valve no interference . The diffusion coefficient of the diffusing particles is related to the mean life time of the fluctuation in the intensity of the scattering light.Generally, the larger the particles, the slower the diffusion and the longer the mean life time of the fluctuation. For spherical particles such as liposomes , the diffusion coefficient D is related to the hydrodynamic radius rh by theStokes Einstein relation D kB T 6 rh where kb is the Boltzmann constant1 T is the absolute temperature and is the viscosity of the solvent. A dilute sample of vesicle suspension in filtered PBS were prepared in clean 6 x 50 mm test tubes. The light scattering measurement was made with a NiComp model TC 200 computing autocorrelator particle sizer. The instrument is equipped with a 64 channel 4 bit autocorrelator and a 5 mW low noise Be Ne laser. Example I Small unilamellar vesicles StN composed of DSPC and Chol in the nolar ratio of 2 to 1 were prepared according to the method described. 14c Cholesterol Oleate was included as the lipid marker. After sonication, annealing and low speed centrifugation, the vesicles were mixed with either gelatin or agarose in sterilized vial to a final concentration of 1 10 zag of SIN. per ml of 18 gelatin solution 2 35 mg of SW per nl of 1t gelatin solution or 3 10 mg of SW per ml of 19 agarose solution.All the vials were then stroed in a refrigerator at 4 C. At different times after preparation, samples of vesicle at different concentration or polymeric medium were melted at room temperature. Dilute samples of these vesicles in PBS were prepared and the size was measured by laser light scattering as described in the method section. As shown inFigure 1, the size remained unchanged when the vesicles were stored in either the gelatin or agarose matrix. On the other hand, the vesicles in PBS aggregated or fused within a short period of time after preparation. Example II In the previous example, it is shown that the size of the vesicle in a polymeric matrix remains unchanged for a prolonged period of time. However, it is also very important in a pharmaceutical context that the liposome retain the entrapped material within the vesicle for a reasonable shelf life. This example shows no leakage of entrapped material in vesicle in a 1 gelatin medium at 4C. 1 mM 14C EDTA in PBS was sonicated with DSPC andChol 2 1 which was labeled with a trace amount of 3H cholesterol Oleate. The free unencapsulated EDTA was separated from the entrapped material by passing through a Sephadex G 50 column. The 14C EDTA encapsulated SUV s were then mixed with gelatin to a final concentration of 10 mg ml of 1 gelatin solution and stored at 4 C.The leakage of entrapped EDTA as a function of time can be monitored by the decrease in the ratio of 14C to 3B. As sown in table I, not only the size of vesicle remains unchanged, but the material inside the vesicle structure also remains entrapped throughout the storage.

A gamma ray perturbed angular coincidence spectroneter PAC was used to measure the intactness of vesicles after loading, Twang K.J. L Mauk MR., Proc. Nat l.Acad. Sci. USA., 74, 4991 1977 and Wares Cr. WestmorelandD.G., Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quart. Biol., 36, 511 1971 .The spectrometer measures the rotational correlation time of 111In in which the correlation time is related to the tumbling rate of the radionuclide. When the 111In is encapsulated within the vesicles, it exhibits a high tumbling rate high G22 because of its binding to the stall chelator within the vesicle. However, once the vesicle is disrupted such as disruption by addition of isopropanol or the entrapped material leaks out of the vesicle by other means, it binds to any surrounding protein present which markedly decreases the tumbling rate. In the following, it is apparent that 1 and 20 day old DSPC and Chol 2 1 vesicles stored in 1 gel at 40C have properties comparable to freshly prepared vesicles after loading.The G22 remains the same with and without serum indicating the long term storage has no damaging effect on the membrane of the vesicles.

DSPC, Chol 2 1 vesicles encapsulate a with lmM NTA were stored in a 1 gelatin solution at 40C. At specific time after preparation, the gel matrix was melted at room temperature. The vesicle suspended in this aqueous soau tion were then loaded as previously described. After loading, 1 mg of the loaded vesicles were injected intravenously in BDFl mice with a 6 8 day old Lewis Lung Carcinoma. The mice were then sacrifice at 24 hrs after injection. By gamma counting, the biodistribution of the injected vesicles was calculated as the amount of radioactivity per gram of tissue. The biodistribution of these aged vesicles were compared with the biodistribution of the reschly prepared vesicle in the same strain of mouse. No significant difference Student t test, p 0.001 was found between freshly prepared vesicle and vesicle in gelatin, as is set forth in TABLE III.

Examples are polysaccharides, such as gum arabic, ethyl cellulose, hydroxylated starch andXelgin, polypeptides, and polyesters synthesized from lactide or acid, poly hydro xybutyrate , poly DL lactide co glycolide .As used in the foregoing examples, agarose is illustrative of suitable polysaccharides, while gelatin is illustrative of suitable polypeptides. It will be understood by those skilled in the art, that other polymeric gel materials can be utilized within the confines of the present invention, as long as the particular such material is capable of forming the desired protective gel surface around the micellular particles at low temperatures and being transformed to a fluid, for example, by melting at approximately room temperature or higher, to become an aqueous suspension. While the use of a gel matrix capable of such transformation by melting is preferred, it will be appreciated that such materials capable of the indicated transformation by other means, e.g., enzymatic, may also be utilized. It will be also understood that while the percentage of gel in the solution or matrix is less significant to achieving the desired stabilization of the particles, it is very important with respect to the temperature at which the gel matrix is formed. Thus, for example, utilizing a gel solution of approximately 1 gel content, solidification will occur at approximately 4 C, whereas with a 10t gel solution, solidification will occur at approximately room temperature. In view of such considerations, the gel matrix will typically be a solution of from about 0.5t by weight to about 10 by weight gel, with about 1 5t by weight being the preferred range. As indicated previously, any of a variety of therapeutic agents may be enclosed in the micellular particles.Illustrative therapeutic agents include antibiotics, metabolic regulators, immune modulators, chemotherapeutic drugs, toxin antidotes, etc. Bytthe same token, the particles may be loaded with 111In or other diagnostic radionuclide, e.g., other gamma emitters such as Ga 67, Tc 99M, Cr S1, T 125, etc, and fluorescent materials or other materials that are detectable in in vitro applications. Pro the foregoing examples, it is clear that the present invention provides for the stabilization of micellular particles during storage for extended periods of time. By suspending the particles within a polymeric gel matrix to form a protective gel surface around the particles, aggregation or fusion of the particles is avoided without sacrifice of the utility of the vesicles or leakage of any enclosed material.
