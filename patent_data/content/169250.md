## Description
PAPER SIZING AGENTBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1 Field of the Invention This invention relates to a paper sizing agent for use in paper making. More particularly, the invention relates to a novel internal paper sizing agent which is effectively employed in the range of. neutral to alkali without using aluminum sulfate as a fixing agent. 2 Description of the Prior Art In the paper manufacturing industry, sizing agents that are prepared from natural rosins or modified rosins, especially, fortified rosin sizing agents that are prepared by saponifying maleic7modified rosins, are regarded as most preferable ones and they are widely used. These sizing agents are used together with aluminum sulfate and they are fixed to paper fibers under acidic conditions of pH 4.0 to 5.0.Owing to the acidic conditions in the use of these sizing agents, the following disadvantages are brought about.That is, paper making machinery suffers from corrosion, the strength and durability of obtained paper are lowered, and inexpensive alkaline fillers such as calcium carbonate cannot be used because the alkaline fillers are decomposed under an acidic condition. Therefore, it has been difficult to reduce much the production cost for paper making. For this reason, neutral sizing agents which can be fixed to wood pulp without using aluminum sulfate, were looked for and some neutral sizing agents that produce excellent sizing effect in the range of neutral to alkali have been proposed. For example, a sizing agent which is prepared by dispersing alkylketene dimer in water in the presence of cationized starch is known. The sizing agent is, however, defective in that the cost is high and it takes much time to produce desired sizing effect. Besides the above sizing agent, several neutral sizing agents of alkenyl succinic anhydride type have been proposed. For example, in U. S. Patent No. 3,102,064, there is proposed a sizing agent that is defined by the following general formula EMI2.1 wherein R is a dimethylene group or a trimethylene group, and R is a member selected from an alkyl group, alkenyl group, aralkyl group and aralkenyl group having more than 5 carbon atoms. The compounds exemplified are only branched olefins such as propylene oligomers and butene oligomers, or straight chain a olefins. The sizing effect of all of these compounds are not satisfactory and they cannot be employed in practical paper making process. In U.S. Patent No. 3,821,069, there is disclosed a sizing agent which comprises the reaction product between maleic anhydride and internal olefins and are represented by the following general formula R CH2 CH CH CH2 R wherein Rx and R are, respectively, alkyl radicals y containing 4 to 10 carbon atoms. In Japanese Preliminary Patent PublicationNo. 57 154495 is proposed a reactive sizing agent which consists of a mixture of alkenyl succinic anhydrides. The mixture is produced by adding maleic anhydride to a mixture of straight chain internal olefins that have 8 to 18 carbon atoms and double bonds thereof are almost evenly distributed at every position except a position. These sizing agents are, however, not satisfactory in view of sizing effect. The internal olefins disclosed in the foregoing U. S. Patent No. 3,812,069 are obtained by disproportionation of a olefins. The preparation of the internal olefins is difficult, which is disadvantageous because the production cost is high. While, the internal olefins that are disclosed in Japanese Preliminary PatentPublication No. 57 154495 are produced by a process that straight chain paraffin is dehydrogenated at 400 to 6000C to obtain straight chain internal olefin and unreacted paraffin is then removed by adsorption with a molecular sieve, or by the process that a olefin of lower molecular ethylene polymer is subjected to isomerization and then to disproportionation.These processes are complicated and are high in cost, and the product is accordingly expensive.BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is, therefore, the primary object of the present invention to provide a novel and improved internal paper sizing agent that is free from the above drawbacks in the conventional art. Another object of the invention is to provide a paper sizing agent which produces excellent sizing effect in neutral to alkaline regions without using aluminum sulfate as a fixing agent. A further object of the invention is to provide a paper sizing agent which can be dispersed well in water, which is compatible with various kinds of paper making additives and which can be preserved for a long time. Still a further object of the invention is to provide a paper sizing agent which can be produced without difficulties at a low cost. Pursuant to the above objects, the inventors of the present application have carried out extensive investigations and experiments. As a result, the present invention has been accomplished. According to the present invention, the paper sizing agent is characterized in that it contains a reaction product and or hydrogenation product of said reaction product, which reaction product is obtained by adding maleic anhydride to a mixture of straight chain olefins having 14 to 36 carbon atoms, said mixture of straight chain olefins comprising 3 to 65 mole , respectively, of olefins having a double bond at 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th position and the total quantity of these olefins is not less than 80 mole .DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The straight chain olefin starting materials for the preparation of neutral sizing agent of the present invention is characterized by the number of carbon atoms and the positions of double bonds in molecular chains. If the number of carbon atoms is less than 14, satisfactory effects of a neutral sizing agent cannot be produced and the storage stability of sizing agent is low.Meanwhile, if the number of carbon atoms exceeds 36, the reaction product exerts sizing effect but the viscosity is too high which causes difficulties in practical uses.Incidentally, more preferable number of carbon atoms is 15 to 24. The number of carbon atoms of olefins may be the same or different from one another. In economical viewpoint, olefins of plurality kinds of carbon atom numbers may be preferably used. According to the present invention, each quantity of a straight chain olefin having a double bond at 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th position is 3 to 65 mole , and preferably 5 to 60 mole , and the total quantity of these olefins is 80 mole or more, and preferably more than 85 mole in the starting material for preparing the sizing agent. The mixture of the straight chain olefins can be discriminated clearly from any of branched olefins and a olefins that are disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 3,102,064. In the olefins as disclosed in U. S. PatentNo. 3,821,069, double bonds exist in the middle part of molecular chains at 6th position those having 12 carbon atoms to 12th position those having 24 carbon atoms provided that the olefins are straight chain olefins. This fact will be understood from the foregoing general formula. Therefore, these olefins can be discriminated from the olefins of the present invention in which 80 mole or more of olefins have double bonds at 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th position. Furthermore, in the olefins disclosed inJapanese Preliminary Patent Publication No. 57 154495, double bonds are evenly distributed to every positions other than a position. In the case of olefins having 14 carbon atoms lower limit of the present invention, possible positions of double bonds are 1st position a position to 7th position in the middle of molecular chain and the total quantity of 2nd to 5th positions is 80 mole or more. Accordingly, average quantity of each of 2nd to 5th positions is more than 20 and the total of 1st, 6th and 7th positions is less than 20 mole . Therefore, the average of 1st, 6th and 7th positions is 6.7 . Assuming that 1st position does not exist, the average of 6th and 7th positions is less than 10 . Therefore, it cannot be said that the double bonds in the starting material of the invention are distributed evenly. Still further, with the increase of carbon atom number, the percentages of 6th or higher positions becomes small, which means that such the case is far from the even distribution of double bonds.Accordingly, the straight chain olefins of the present invention are apparently different from the olefins that are disclosed in Japanese Preliminary Patent PublicationNo. 57 154495. As explained above, the mixture of olefins used in the present invention is quite different from the olefins that have been proposed in the conventional art, in view of the distribution of double bonds. Owing to the use of such different olefins, a paper sizing agent having excellent sizing effect as compared with those prepared from the conventional olefin starting materials can be obtained.This characteristic advantage cannot be suggested by any prior art. The distribution of double bonds in the straight 13 chain olefins can be obtained by C NMR analysis. According to C NMR analysis, the chemical shifts are as follows 1st position C atom of a olefin 114.2 ppm 2nd position C atom of 2 olefin trans 124.5 ppm do. cis 123.5 ppm 3rd position C atom of 3 olefin trans 131.9 ppm do. cis 131.5 ppm 4th position C atom of 4 olefin trans 130.15 ppm do. cis 129.63 ppm 5th position C atom of 5 olefin trans 130.37 ppm 5th position C atom of 5 olefin cis 129.85 ppm Double bond C atom of other olefin trans 130.44 ppm do. cis 129.92 ppm The composition of olefins having double bonds at 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th or higher positions can be determined from the ratio of strengths of these chemical shifts. The straight chain olefins that are used in the present invention can be prepared without difficulty by isomerizing straight chain a olefins having corresponding numbers of carbon atoms in the presence of an acid catalyst under appropriate reaction conditions. The straight chain a olefins as the starting materials of the invention can be easily obtained industrially from polymerization of ethylene by Ziegler process or thermal cracking of wax. Exemplified as the acid catalysts for use in the isomerization are homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts of acid minerals such as synthetic silica alumina, synthetic silica magnesia, solid phosphoric acid, acid clay, activated clay, heteropoly acids such as H3PW12O40, H4SiW12040 andH3PMo12040, and AlCl3 electron donor and BF3 electron donor. The reaction conditions are as follows temperatures 30 250 C, pressures normal pressure 20 kg cmê, and reaction times 30 minutes 10 hours. These conditions can be properly selected according to the kinds of starting a olefins and catalyst. The type of reaction may be any of batchwise, semi batchwise and continuous. When continuous reaction is employed, the values of LHSV liquid hourly space velocity is preferably set in the range of 0.5 to 20. When the above straight chain a olefins are isomerized in the presence of a catalyst, they can be treated with or without an inert medium. Furthermore, it is desirable for maintaining the catalytic activity of the isomerization acid catalyst that the olefins are previously subjected to clay treatment at room temperature. As described above, the straight chain olefins of the invention can be obtained by isomerizing a olefins in the presence of an acid catalyst, in which it is necessary that the content of unreacted a olefins in the reaction product is not more than 20 and preferably 10 or less. In the isomerization, a small amount of dimer and other heavier olefins of solefins are also produced.However, when the reaction product is used for preparing a sizing agent, it can be employed without removing the heavier olefins. Prom the economical viewpoint, the use without removal is preferable. The addition of maleic anhydride to the thus prepared straight chain olefin mixture is carried out according to conventional methods. That is, the reaction can easily proceed heating both the materials to 180 2500C under normal pressure or an elevated pressure in an inert gas. The molar ratio of both the materials is not especially restricted, however, 0.4 to 2 moles of maleic anhydride to 1 mole of the straight chain olefin mixture is generally adopted. After the reaction, the maleic modified reaction product of the invention can be obtained by removing unreacted maleic anhydride and remaining straight chain olefin mixture by reduced pressure distillation. In this addition reaction, the main reaction product is an adduct of 1 mole of straight chain olefin with 1 mole of maleic anhydride. However, small quantities of by products such as an adduct of 1 mole of straight chain olefin with 2 moles of maleic anhydride, 1 2 adduct and polymer of maleic anhydride are simultaneously produced. These by products may be either removed or not removed. From economical viewpoint, it is desirable to use the reaction product as a sizing agent without removing the by products. The reaction product can be further subjected to ordinary hydrogenation process with using a solid catalyst such as palladium orRaney nickel to obtain alkyl succinic anhydride, which product comes also within the scope of the present invention. When paper pulp is treated with the sizing agent obtained in the above described process, the sizing agent is homogeneously dispersed in water by a forced mixing apparatus such as a homogeneous mixer, homogenizer or high pressure emulsifier and the obtained dispersion is then added to pulp slurry. When the sizing agent is dispersed in water, a dispersing agent or protective colloid such as cationized starch, gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol, cationic polyacrylamide, or polyethylene imine, or a nonionic emulsifier can be used together. Among the above dispersing agents, the cationized starch, cationic polyacrylamide and polyethylene imine have also the effect as fixing agents to pulp. The nonionic emulsifiers are exemplified by polyoxyalkylene sorbitan fatty acid ester such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate polyoxyalkylene sorbitol fatty acid esters such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol hexaoleate, polyethylene sorbitol laurate and polyoxyethylene sorbitol oleate laurate polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether such as polyoxyethylene alkyl ether polyoxyalkylene alkylaryl ether such as polyoxyethylene alkylphenol polyoxyalkylene monoester and diester such as polyoxyethylene alkyl esters polyoxyalkylene alkylamine such as polyoxyethylene alkylamine polyoxyalkylene alkylamide such as polyoxyethylene alkylamide ester of polyalcohol with fatty acid and higher alcohol. In the present invention, the quantity of the foregoing protective colloid used together with the paper sizing agent, is determined according to the dispersing property of the paper sizing agent in water and the fixing property to pulp of prepared paper sizing medium. The quantity of the protective colloid is generally in the range of 50 to 500 , preferably 100 to 200 , relative to the paper sizing agent. The quantity of nonionic emulsifier is determined according to the dispersing property of paper sizing agent, and is generally in the range of 3 to 30 , and preferably 5 to 20 relative to the paper sizing agent. In the case that the above nonionic emulsifier is previously mixed into the paper sizing agent of the present invention and the mixture is then dispersed in water, any forced mixing apparatus such as those used in dispersing with a protective colloid is not necessary.The sizing agent with nonionic emulsifier can be easily dispersed only by using a pulp mixing aspirator or by passing the mixture through an orifice these methods are hereinafter referred to as Wself emulsifying method .Therefore the paper making process can be simplified. The quantity of paper sizing agent used in the present invention varies to some extent according to the kind and usages of paper to be produced. The quantity of the paper sizing agent is, however, generally in the range of 0.05 to 5.0 by weight to dry basis pulp. It is possible to add more than 5.0 by weight of paper sizing agent but the increase of sizing effect can be hardly expected so that the addition of more than 5 is not advantageous in economical viewpoint. As described above, when the paper sizing agent of this invention is used together with a cationic protective colloid or a nonionic emulsifying agent in neutral or alkaline conditions, the sizing agent can be dispersed well in water. Owing to the use of the specific olefins, the sizing agent produces excellent sizing effect, that is, desired sizing effect can be obtained by using a smaller quantity of the sizing agent as compared with the conventional art.Furthermore, it maintains good sizing effect during long term preservation, that is, the sizing effect of prepared sizing medium after long term storage is almost the same as the effect that is produced just after it is made up. This fact is more advantageous as compared with the conventional sizing agents. The paper sizing agent of this invention can be used of course singly, and if desired, it can be used together with known sizing agents by mixing with them in any mixing ratio. It should be noted also that known pigments and fillers such as clay, talc, titanium oxide, calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate and diatomaceous earth can be used in paper making process together with the sizing agent of the present invention. The preparation and uses of the sizing agent of the invention will be described in more detail in the following examples. It should be noted, however, that the present invention be limited not by the specific disclosure herein but only by the appended claims.
