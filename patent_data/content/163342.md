# Bar feeding apparatus for multi spindle lathe.

## Abstract
A device for withdrawing from a bar pusher and thereafter unloading the crop ends of the metal bars in a bar feeding apparatus for a multi spindle lathe, said device being suitable also for placing a new bar on said bar pusher, is disclosed. The device of the invention is comprised essentially of a pair of movable jaws which by means of a turning movement close onto the crop end of a metal bar and lock said crop end therebetween. Said crop end is the residual part of the lathe machining of the metal bar. Thereafter the jaws accomplish a translation movement to detach the crop end from a bar pusher which formerly caused the bar forwarding in the feeding apparatus of the lathe. The jaws thereafter open slowly dropping the crop end in a proper unloading zone. Finally the jaws close onto a new metal bar to be machined and, by means of a further translation movement in the direction opposite to the former one, perform the insertion of the new metal bar end into the bar pusher.
