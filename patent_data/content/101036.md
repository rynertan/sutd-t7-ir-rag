An aerosol dispensing apparatus for dispensing metered amounts of fluid material from a main reservoir 12 defined by a container 11 . In order to provide a uniform dosing with an apparatus of simple construction and mode of operation the apparatus comprises a metering chamber 13 having a pair of apertures 15, 17 that respectively connect the metering chamber to said main reservoir and to the exterior of said metering chamber a chamber sealing sleeve 16, 18 mounted in each aperture, and an additional sealing sleeve 20 mounted within the metering chamber, all of the sleeves being in substantial alignment and a slidable stem 22 having a dispensing passage 28 and a bypass passage 32 , said stem being positioned within and cooperable with the sleeves so that said bypass passage 32 is adapted to selectively fluidically interconnect said main reservoir with said metering chamber, and said dispensing passage is adapted to selectively fluidically interconnect said metering chamber with the exterior thereof.
