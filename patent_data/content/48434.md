# Electro acoustic planar transducer.

## Abstract
An electro acoustic transducer using thin, light weight, planar diaphragms 13, 14 driven by strategically located, coil driven, high energy, permanent magnets 41 . A frame work 12 maintains the diaphragms 13, 14 in substantially co planar relationship a predetermined distance from and parallel to a rear support wall 16 . The diaphragms 13, 14 include at least one hinged woofer diaphragm 13 and a foam supported tweeter diaphragm 14 . The small, high energy movable permanent magnets 41 are attached to the rear surface of each movable diaphragm 13, 14 . Cooperat ing with each movable magnet 41 is a respective, stationary electromagnetic coil 29 with a cross over network directing the incoming signal to the appropriate coils, thereby placing the magnets 41 and attached diaphragms 13, 14 into cooperating fore and aft motion. The frontal acoustical waves produced by each woofer constructively interfere to augment low frequency response. The tweeter construction provides wide frontal dispersion of high frequency acoustical waves. Woofer backwaves are attenuated before emerging along the rear support wall and the tweeter backwave is vented into a rear isolative chamber.
