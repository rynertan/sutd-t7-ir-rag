# Furniture glide and furniture incorporating furniture glides.

## Abstract
A furniture glide 1 has a further furniture glide within it and possibly a third glide. The first glide member 10 is made of hard plastic and has a rounded, bottom shoulder 12 surrounding a downwardly opening cavity 11 therein. A second glide member 20 comprises a soft, plastic member seated within the said cavity 11 and projecting a short distance below said rounded shoulder, at least when the glide is unweighted. A third glide member 30 comprises a metal cap which seats over the second glide member 20 and against the first glide member 10 to provide a glide with a metal bottom surface. A purchaser of an item of furniture such as a chair fitted with such glides may use the chair as purchased or discard the metal glide member. The chair will then move around less readily. When a person sits in the chair, the soft glide member will be compressed into the recess 11 and part of the weight will be taken by the hard glide member 10 . Two or more chairs or other items of furniture may be positioned alongside one another with the third glide members 20 removed or omitted and the friction between the soft glide members 10 and the floor will render ganging means between the chairs unnecessary.
