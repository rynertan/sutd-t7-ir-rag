# Sheet feeding apparatus.

## Abstract
Banknote feeding apparatus is disclosed which includes a cassette for a stack S of banknotes, a reciprocating suction arm 6 acting on the endmost banknote for remov ing banknotes singly from the end of the stack and conveying them into the nip of a pair of rollers, and which is characterized by a gulp arm 27 with a blade 29 which is inserted into the stack and removes from the end of the stack a batch of banknotes, conveying them into the same nip rollers. The gulp arm is coupled to the rotation of the drive shaft 21 of the suction arm 6 by means of a parallel drive shaft 23 which is driven by a drive arm 22 by means of a follower 24 only in the event of a blockage of banknotes. A blockage signal energises a solenoid 20 which pushes the follower 24 into a position such that it will be driven by the drive arm 22 , so rotating the gulp arm 27 . The removal of a batch from the end of the stack should clear the blockage.
