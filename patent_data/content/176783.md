## Description
The present invention relates to a multiple output switching power supply, and more particularly to a current type multiple output switching power supply suitable to supply a power to an OA or FA equipment which requires a high precision of output voltage. A current type switching power supply is disclosed in JP A 55 120369 which discloses that a recovery current of a flywheel diode inserted in a secondary circuit of a transformer does not flow into a switching device in a primary circuit of the transformer and flow of an excessive current in an input circuit is suppressed even if the transformer is saturated by a surge voltage from the input circuit. However, it does not recognize a problem encountered in the multiple output switching power supply. JP A 55 144775 discloses a technique to operate a switching device to stabilize one of the outputs so that the multiple outputs are stabilized. In the disclosed technique, a choke coil inserted in a secondary circuit of a transformer has a plurality of magnetically coupled windings. In the disclosed technique, it is not possible to determine the output voltages by turn ratios of a plurality of secondary windings wound on a transformer but turn ratios of the windings wound on the choke coil should also be taken into consideration. As a result, the more the number of outputs is, the more difficult to design the power supply. Further, since one output is stabilized by the operation of the switching device, variations of other output voltages due to a variation of the one output voltage, that is, voltage variations due to so called cross regulation increase. Causes of the cross regulation are leakage inductances and winding resistances of the transformer. In the disclosed technique, the leakage inductances and the winding resistances which cause the cross regulation during an on period of the switching device affect to the transformer as well as leakage inductances and resistances of the windings of the choke coil and make it difficult to precisely control all of the output voltages. In a technique disclosed in JP A 56 19119, an inductor is connected to an A.C. input. As a result, a ripple of a current flowing through the inductor is large, a current capacity of a rectifying filtering circuit in a secondary circuit of a transformer is large and a maximum current flowing through a leakage inductor and a resistor of the transformer is large. As a result, outputs are affected by voltage drops thereacross and precision of the output voltages is lowered. A multiple output switching power supply with the features included in the first part of claim 1 is known from JP A 57 177277. In that circuit, the voltage supplied to the load of only one of the secondary circuits is stabilized by controlling the ON OFF operation of the switching device included in series connection at the primary side of the transformer, whereas each of the remaining secondary circuits requires its own voltage regulator circuit, each including a separate switching transistor and a controller. It is an object of the present invention to provide a multiple output switching power supply which is capable of supplying constant voltages at a desired mutual ratio at the outputs of a plurality of secondary circuits with an uncomplicated circuit design. The invention meets this problem by the circuit characterized in claim 1. Fig. 1 shows a general multiple output switching power supply. Fig. 2 is an equivalent circuits of the circuit shown in Fig.1 during an on period of a transistor Q. Fig. 3 shows a circuit configuration of a prior art multiple output switching power supply having a plurality of windings on a choke coil. Fig. 4 is an equivalent circuit of Fig. 3. Fig. 5 shows an embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 6 is an equivalent circuit during an off period of the transistor Q, for illustrating an operation of the energy discharge circuit of Fig 5. Figs. 7 to 9 show other embodiments of the present invention. A multiple output switching power supply is explained with reference to Fig. 1. E denotes a D.C. input power supply. A current I The operation of the circuit of Fig.1 is explained with reference to Fig. 2 which shows an equivalent circuit during the on period of the transistor Q. L₂ denotes an inductance of the reactor T₂, Z₁ denotes an impedance including a leakage inductance, a winding resistance and a circuit resistance of the winding n₁, and Z₂ denotes an impednace including a leakage inductance, a winding resistance and a circuit resistance of the winding n₂. The current flowing through the inductance L₂ shunts to the output terminals 1 and 2 with currents I₁ and I₂, respectively. The currents I₁ and I₂ meet the following relationship. Referring to Fig. 1, the voltages induced across the windings of the transformer T₁ during the on period of the transistor Q is considered. The voltage induced across the winding n₁ with the dotted end being positive is equal to V₁ V If V From the formula 4 , the voltage V₂ at the output terminal 2 is expressed by The voltage drop I₁ Z₁ V From the above, it is seen that the voltage V₂ at the output terminal 2 is defined by the turn ratio of the secondary windings n₁ and n₂ of the transformer T₁, and the voltage V₁ at the output terminal 1 and the voltage drops in the circuit. Since k₁ and k₂ are generally smaller than V₁, V₂ can be expressed as follows without a large error. Thus, the turn ratios of the transformer T₁ can be substantially determined by the ratios of the output voltages and the circuit design is facilitated. In the above Figures, a multiple output switching power supply having two outputs was shown. When Accordingly, the design of the multiple output switching power supply is facilitated. The circuit shown in Fig. 1 is compared with a prior art power supply having a plurality of magnetically coupled windings on a choke coil inserted in a secondary circuit of a transformer. Fig. 3 shows a configuration of the prior art power supply. T denotes a transformer, E denotes a D.C. input power supply, L denotes a choke coil having magnetically coupled windings n From Fig. 3, it is seen that the following relationships must be met during the on period of the transistor Q. where V The voltage V From the formulas 9 , 10 and 11 , From the formula 12 , the voltage V₂ at the output terminal 2 is expressed by Since the impedances of the transformer T and the choke coil and the diode voltage drops are omitted in the formula 13 as described above, the formula 13 corresponds to the formula 7 which represents the voltage V₂ in the circuit of Fig. 1. As seen from the comparison of the formulas 7 and 13 , the output voltage V₂ of Fig. 1 is essentially determined by the turn ratio of the secondary windings n₁ and n₂ of the transformer T₁ while the voltage V₂ in the prior art of Fig. 3 cannot be defined without taking the voltage V Referring to an equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 4, the operation of the prior art power supply of Fig. 3 is explained in detail. Fig. 4 shows the equivalent circuit during the on period of the transistor Q. E denotes the D.C. input power supply, I₁ and I₂ denote the currents supplied to loads connected to output terminals 1 and 2, respectively, Z₁ and Z₂ denote the impedances including the leakage inductances, winding resistances and circuit resistances of the transformer T, and Z From the formula 14 , the voltage V₂ at the output terminal 2 is expressed by From the formula 15 , it is seen that when the output currents I₁ and I₂ change, voltage variations which are proportional to Z₁ Z On the other hand, in the present case, it is seen from the formula 2 that the variation of V₂ when I₁ and I₂ change is proportional to Z₁ and Z₂. As a result, the voltage variation due to the change of the load current is smaller in the circuit of Fig. 1 and the precision of the output is higher. As described above, the circuits of Fig. 1 and of Fig. 3 are different from each other in their concepts and effects. Fig. 5 shows an embodiment of the invention with a specific circuit configuration of the energy discharge means 10 shown in Fig. 1. The energy discharge means 10 comprises windings n The operation of the energy discharge means is explained in detail with reference to an equivalent circuit of Fig. 6 during the off period of the transistor Q. L₂ denote an inductance of the reactor T₂, and Z₁ and Z₂ denote impedances including the leakage inductances, winding resistances and circuit resistances of the windings n From the equation 17 , the voltage V₂ at the output terminal 2 is expressed by In the formulas 16 18 , V The voltage drop I₁ Z₂ V It is seen from the above that the voltage V₂ at the output terminal 2 during the off period of the transistor Q is defined by a function similar to that shown in the formula 6 . The same is applicable to the multiple output switching power supply having Accordingly, the output voltage V Fig. 7 shows another embodiment. In the present embodiment, a voltage V₁ at an output terminal 2 is a sum of a voltage V₁ developed across a winding n₁ and a voltage developed across a winding n₂. Windings n In the embodiment of Fig. 5, the turn ratio of the windings n₁ and n₂ is essentially same as the ratio of the output voltages V₁ and V₂, as shown in the formula 7 . The same is true for the turn ratio of the windings n In the circuit configuration of Fig. 7, the numbers of turns of the windings n₂ and n Accordingly, the turn ratios n₂ n₁ and n Fig. 8 shows another embodiment. In the present embodiment, a control circuit 11 is provided to control the switching of the transistor Q to keep the voltage V₁ at the output terminal 1 constant. It is seen from the formulas 6 and 19 that if the voltage V₁ at the output terminal 1 is constant, the voltage at the output terminal 2 can be stabilized within a variation of a voltage drop across an impedance in the circuit. In the present embodiment, since the voltage V₁ at the output terminal 1 is kept constant, the voltage V₂ at the output terminal 2 need not take the change of V₁ into consideration as shown in the formulas 6 and 19 , and the output precision of the voltage V₂ is further improved. Alternatively, the control circuit 11 of the present embodiment may be provided in the embodiment of Fig. 5 to control the switching of the transistor Q in order to keep the voltage V₁ of the output terminal 1 constant. Fig. 9 shows another embodiment. In the present embodiment, Alternatively, the control circuit 11 may be provided in the embodiment of Fig. 5 to control the switching of the transistor Q in order to keep the voltage V₁ at the output terminal 1 constant, so that stable outputs are supplied from The control circuit 11 shown in Figs. 8 and 9 may be Hitachi switching power supply control IC HA17524 or Texas Instruments TL 494. The configuration and operation of those IC s are well known and they are not explained here. In accordance with the present invention, the output voltages of the multiple output switching power supply can be defined by the turn ratios of the secondary windings of the transformer and the windings of the energy discharge circuit of the reactor, and the design of the power supply is facilitated. When the control circuit is used to control the switching device such that one of the output voltages is kept constant, the voltage variations of other outputs can be less than 5 . Thus, the multiple output switching power supply used for the OA and FA equipments are simplified and the size and cost thereof can be reduced.
