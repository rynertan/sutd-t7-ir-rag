# Reaction injection moulded elastomers containing high molecular weight organic acids.

## Abstract
Reaction injection moulded RIM elastomers derived from high molecular weight amine terminated polyethers, a chain extender and a polyisocyanate exhibit improved tear strength and mould release properties when they include an acid of the formula R COâ‚‚H The RIM elastomers are useful, for example, as auto mobile body parts.
