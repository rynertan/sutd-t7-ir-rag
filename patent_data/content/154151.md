# Centrifugal casting furnace.

## Abstract
A centrifugal ceramic casting furnace 40 including a horizontal arm rotatably supported by the upper end of a vertical shaft 32 driven by a motor 22 and the arm having a casting ring cradle on one end, a muffle movable along said arm a limited distance toward and from the cradle 68 and a counterweight 118, 120 device mounted upon the opposite end of the arm adjustably both longitudinally and upwardly in a manner to balance the opposite ends of the arm statically and also adjustably dispose the effective masses of the muffle and counterweight within a common horizontal plane to effect substantial freedom from vibration while the furnace is rotating at a centrifugal casting speed.
