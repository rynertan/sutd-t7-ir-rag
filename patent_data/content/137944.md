# CONTROL OF A FRACTIONAL DISTILLATION PROCESS

## Abstract
In a fractional distillation process in which it is desired to maintain a desired ASTM end point temperature of the overhead liquid product withdrawn from the fractional dis tillation process, changes in the heat removed by the frac tional distillation process per unit of the feed are utilized to determine the equilibrium flash vaporization initial point and the equilibrium flash vaporization end point tem perature for the overhead liquid product. The initial point temperature and end point temperature are then utilized to determine the actual slope of the equilibrium flash vaporiza tion boiling point line. Changes in the slope of the equilib rium flash vaporization boiling point line are utilized to determine the actual slope of the ASTM boiling point curve at any particular time. The actual ASTM end point tem perature for the overhead liquid product is derived based on the actual slope of the ASTM boiling point curve thus determined. The actual ASTM end point temperature is utilized to control the fractional distillation process so as to maintain a desired ASTM end point temperature for the overhead liquid product withdrawn from the fractional dis tillation process.
