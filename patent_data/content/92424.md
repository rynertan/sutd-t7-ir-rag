# Method and apparatus for damping aircraft rotor drive.

## Abstract
Damping of a helicopter rotor drive train, the drive train including the free turbines of a gas turbine engine 12, the aircraft main 34 and tail 36 rotors, and associated shafts and gears 30, 32, is accomplished through active modulation of the fuel flow to the engine gas generator. The fuel flow is varied such that a transient torque will be developed by the free turbines which in opposite in phase to drive train resonances. The turbine speed signal NF is supplied to a damping circuit 44 which functions as a high pass filter and causes a phase shift to produce output signal NG
