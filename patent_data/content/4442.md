# Improved elastomeric ethylene carboxylic acid copolymer, a process for its preparation vulcanizable compositions containing the copolymer and vulcanized articles prepared therefrom.

## Abstract
In order to improve the mill release and green strength of an elastomeric copolymer derived from ethylene alkyl acrylates or vinyl esters of carboxylic acids and α,β unsatruated monoor dicarboxylic acids, which copolymer may optionally contain segments derived from carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide or acrylonitrile, a small quantity of one or more specific chromium III compounds are incorporated into the copolymer. A process for the preparation of the copolymer is described and exemplified, and vulcanizable compositions containing the copolymer and vulcanized articles prepared therefrom are described.
