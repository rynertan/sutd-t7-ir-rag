# Device for holding a slider for a slide fastener.

## Abstract
A device 10 for holding a slider 11 in position for threading onto a slide fastener chain 12 includes a housing 17A, 17B having a support surface 19A, 19B for supporting thereon a slider body 13 upside down, and a slit 23 receptive of a pull tab 15 hanging from the slider body 13 . A lever 25 has a pair of juxtaposed first and second arms 29, 30 disposed one on each side of the slit 25 , there being on the first arm 29 a locking projection 32 movable into and out of the slit 23 . The lever 25 is pivotable in the housing 17A, 17B between a slider holding position and a slider release position. The second arm 30 extends beyond the first arm 29 to such an extent that as the slider 11 is placed on the support surface 19A, 19B , the second arm 30 is pressed downwardly by a yoke 14 of the slider 11 to cause the lever 25 to be pivotally moved to the slider holding position. When a pull is exerted on the slider 11 during the threading of the fastener chain 12 through the slider 11 , the second arm 30 is brought into contact with the slider body 13 , thus preventing the lever 25 from being pivotally moved to the slider release position.
