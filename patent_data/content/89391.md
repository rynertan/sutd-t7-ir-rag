# Method and dilution refrigerator for cooling at temperatures below 1K.

## Abstract
The dilution refrigerator operates by sucking a ⁴He rich mixture from a tank 1 and returning it to the tank through a superleak 11 . Thereby the ³He is separated and returned to the ³He rich content of the tank 1 . By this cycling process, a drop in temperature is obtained at the exit of the superleak 11 and through re mixing of the ³He with the ⁴He. Cycling of the liquid ³He ⁴He mixture is performed by a bellows pump 9 maintained in a container 16 at a temperature below 2K and by specially designed valves 4, 6, 10 comprising a steel ball as a plug and a gold ring as the valve seat.
