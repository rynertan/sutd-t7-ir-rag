## Description
DIAPHRAGM FOR A FILTER PRESS The present invention relates to a diaphragm for a compression type filter press. In the field of filtration, efficient dehydration is desired with a view to saving of energy, and a compression type filter press has been widely used in recent years. In the compression type filter press, a diaphragm is provided on one side of a filtration chamber so that a cake remaining in the chamber upon filtration is further compressed by the diaphragm. The diaphragm is usually made of a natural rubber NR , or a synthetic rubber such as styrene rubber SBR , nitrile rubber NBR or an ethylene propylene rubber EPR depending upon the type or temperature of the material e.g. a slurry to be filtered. However, such conventional natural or synthetic rubbers had drawbacks in the heat resistance, thermal aging resistance or chemical resistance, and an improvement in this respect has been desired. It has been proposed to use a block copolymer of polypropylene with polyethylene. However, such a block copolymer is inferior to rubbers in the elasticity, and when used repeatedly, it undergoes whitening or the residual strain tends to increase. Further, such a copolymer is poor in the impact resistance at a low temperature. Therefore, there has been a possibility of an accident such that the diaphragm breaks during the compressing operation in winter time. Under these circumstances, the present inventors has conducted extensive researches to obtain an elastomer for the diaphragm free from the above mentioned difficulties, and finally accomplished the present invention. Namely, the present invention provides a diaphragm for a filter press, which is made of a polyolefin thermoplastic elastomer composed esentially of a polyolefin resin and an ethylene propylene copolymer rubber hereinafter referred to simply as EPM or an ethylene propylenenon conjugated diene copolymer rubber hereinafter referred to simply as EPDM . Now, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the preferred embodiments. In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a graph showing the changes in the elongation of a diaphragm of the present invention and of a conventional diaphragm due to thermal aging. Figure 2 is likewise a graph showing the changes in the hardness due to thermal aging. As the polyolefin resin used as the hard segment among the components constituting the elastomer of the present invention, there may be mentioned, for instance, isotactic polypropylene, syndiotactic polypropylene, polyethylene or a propylene a olefin copolymer such as a propylene ethylene copolymer, an ethylene l butene copolymer, a propylene l hexene copolymer or a propylene4 methyl l pentene copolymer. As EPM as the soft segment, there may be mentioned an ethylene propylene copolymer rubber composed of from 20 to 90 by weight, preferably from 40 to 85 by weight, of ethylene and from 10 to 80 by weight, preferably from 15 to 60 by weight, of propylene. Likewise, EPDM may be composed of from 80 to 99 by weight of an ethylenepropylene component and from 1 to 20 by weight of a nonconjugated diene component. The non conjugated diene component of EPDM includes a straight chain diene such as 1,4 hexadiene, 1,4 pentadiene or 1,5 hexadiene and a cyclic polyene such as dicyclopentadiene, methylene norbornene, ethylidene norbornene, cyclooctadiene or methyltetrahydroindene. The non conjugated diene constitutes from 1 to 20 by weight, preferably from 4 to 10 by weight of EPDM.The proportion of ethylene and propylene constituting the ethylenepropylene component are the same as the corresponding proportions in the above mentioned EPM. The blending ratio of the polyolefin resin to EPM orEPDM is preferably within a range of from 10 90 to 50 50.These components may be mechanically blended by means of a Bunbury s mixer, a single or twin screw extruder, a variety of kneaders or open rolls. They may be partially cross linked by the following steps. 1 EPM or EPDM is partially cross linked, and then blended with an polyolefin resin. 2 Cross linking is conducted while EPM or EPDM and the polyolefin resin are being mixed. 3 The two components are preliminarily kneaded and then subjected to cross linking. The degree of gelation of the partially cross linked elastomer is preferably such that when it is, immersed in cyclohexane at 23 0C for 48 hours, the insoluble component is within a range of from 20 to 95 by weight. With respect to the physical properties of the elastomer of the present invention, the flexural modulus of elasticity at 23 0C is preferably from 75 to 600 kg cm2. If the flexural modulus is less than 75 kg cm2, the rigidity tends to be poor, whereby when subjected to filtration operation by supplying a high pressure fluid at a level of e.g. from 10 to 30 kg cm2, the diaphragm tends to locally expand and enter into an inlet for the fluid, and the diaphragm tends to break frequently. Accordingly, the flexural modulus is desired to be at least 75 kg cm2. On the other hand, if the flexural modulus exceeds 600 kg cm2, the elasticity tends to be poor, whereby the permanent strain increases by repeated use.Accordingly, the flexural modulus is 2 preferably less than 600 kg cm On the other hand, the hardness is preferably from 60 to 85 as measured in accordance with JIS K6301. If the hardness is less than 60 , the elastomer tends to be so soft that the sealing between the support panel and the diaphragm tends to be poor. On the other hand, if the hardness exceeds 850, and permanent strain of compression due to the fastening force normally from 40 to 50kg cm2 of the filter press tends to increase. Accordingly, the hardness should preferably be at most 850 Further, the permanent elongation is preferably at most 20 , as measured in accordance with JIS K6301.If the permanent elongation exceeds 20 , the permanent strain increases by repeated use, thus leading to a trouble for the filtration operation. The above mentioned elastomer of the present invention may be formed into a diaphragm of a desired shape by a conventional injection molding method or compression molding method. The diaphragm of the present invention made of the above mentioned material, has far superior heat resistance, thermal aging resistance and chemical resistance to the conventional diaphragms made of rubber. Further, the diaphragm of the present invention is durable for a long period of time, and thus is extremely advantageous as a diaphragm for a compression type filter press. Now, the present invention will be described with reference to Examples. However, it should be understood that the present invention is by no means restricted by these specific Examples.EXAMPLE 1 A sheet made of a blend comprising 19 by weight ofPP polypropylene and 81 by weight of EPDM and having G thickness of 6 mm, was designated as Sample No. 1.
