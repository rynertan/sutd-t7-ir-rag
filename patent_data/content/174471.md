# Corrosion protection system.

## Abstract
Methods of preventing corrosion in which current flows between the to be protected substrate and a distributed electrode whose electrochemically active surface provided by an element which is composed of a conductive polymer and which is at least 500 microns thick. In one embodiment, the electrode is a flexible strip comprising a highly conduc tive core, eg. of copper, and a conductive polymer element surrounding the core. In another embodiment, the electrode is a conductive polymer layer which conforms to the surface of the substrate but is separated from it by a layer of insulation.
