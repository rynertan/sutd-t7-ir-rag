# A rope lock.

## Abstract
A rope lock intended for preventing a rope 13 inserted therein from being moved in a certain direction therethrough by a pulling force in the rope. The lock is primarily intended for use as a sheet lock or a winch unloading lock on sailing boats. The lock has an abutment 4 , an operating member 6 arranged pivotable about a first pin 17 in relation to the abutment and a locking member 10 arranged pivotable about a second pin 11 relative to the abutment. The locking member has a thrust portion 12 which forces the rope towards the abutment with a thrusting force in the active position, but not in the inactive position. The locking member also has a contact portion 14 for generating at least a portion of this thrust force. The lock is taken between active position and inactive position by pivoting the operating member. Said member has an operating portion 9 which is eccentric rela tive to the first pin, and which is adapted for providing a torque about the second pin, at least in the active position, such that the tope is held between the abutment and the thrust portion.
