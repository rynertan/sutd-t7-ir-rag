# Method and apparatus for welding.

## Abstract
A beam such as a laser beam is used to weld two or more overlapping layers of metal together. The beam is generated by a generator 1 , and applied through a tubular clamping element 2 which cooperates with a second tubular clamp ing element 3 to squeeze together the metal layers to be welded. By feeding an inert gas within the tubular elements 2, 3 via jets 15 , an oxygen free weld zone may be obtained. The beam is deflected to create a substantially spiral shaped weld pattern. The beam generated may be moved under the control of a computer 6 , or the workpiece and clamping members may be moved. Improved weld strength over prior art resistance welding techniques is achieved, with a greater tolerance for differ ences in the relative thickness of the metal layers.
