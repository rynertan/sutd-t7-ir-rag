# STAMPABLE SHEETS OF BONDED LAMINATE OF METAL SHEET AND FIBER MAT REINFORCED POLY ARYLENE SULFIDE AND METHOD OF PREPARATION USING RADIO FREQUENCY ENERGY

## Abstract
A method for preparing stampable composites of poly arylene sulfide compositions that are radio frequency energy sensitive and reinforced with fibrous or filamentous mat the stampable composites prepared thereby a method for preparing a laminate with metal sheet and fiber mat reinforced poly arylene sulfide in which the poly arylene sulfide is sensitive to radio frequency energy a bonded laminate produced thereby stamped objects produced from the composites and or laminates.
