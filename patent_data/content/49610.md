## Description
A NOVEL CARBAPENEM COMPOUND, ITS ESTERS AND SALTS, AND PROCESSES FOR PRODUCING THEM This invention relates to a novel carbapenem compound and its esters and salts, and more particularly, to a carbapenem compound represented by the following formula I EMI1.1 and its esters and salts, and also to processes for producing the same. The present Applicants have succeeded in isolating the substance KA 6643 B showing antibacterial activities and 8 lactamase inhibitory activity as a fermentation metabolite, and which is represented by the formula II below, from a culture broth of a strain of Streptomyces sp. KC 6643 belonging to the genus Streptomyces. This new strain was deposited with the Fermentation ResearchInstitute of the Agency of Industrial Science BR Technology located at No. 1 3, Higashi l chome, Yatabemachi, Tsukuba gun, Ibaragi ken, Japan, on April 7, 1978, and has been given Acceptance No. FERM P 4467. The strain was also deposited with the American Type CultureCollection located at No. 12301, Parklawn Drive,Rockville, Maryland, U.S.A., on March 12, 1979, and has been given ATCC Acceptance No. ATCC 31493.The isolation of the substance KA 6643 B is described inJapanese Patent Application No. 54 119139, as laid open under No. 56 43284, and in published U.K. PatentApplication No. 2,047,700A, both in the name of the present Applicants. EMI2.1 The present Applicants have made a further investigation of this substance KA 6643 B and, as a result, have found that the novel compound of the formula I can be obtained through the elimination of sulphuric acid from the substance and that this compound I is useful as an intermediate for preparing medicines showing antibacterial and B lactamase inhibitory actions. The present invention is based on this finding. It is accordingly, an object of the invention to provide a novel carbapenem compound, and esters and salts thereof which are effectively useful as intermediates for the preparation of medicines exhibiting antibacterial and B lactamase inhibitory activities. Another object of the invention is to provide a process for producing such a carbapenem compound, and its esters and salts. According to the invention, there is provided the carbapenem compound represented by the following formula I EMI2.2 at the carboxyl group thereof. The carbapenem compound I , and its esters and salts according to the invention can be prepared by esterifying the substance KA 6643 B of the formula II at the carboxyl group thereof, and subjecting the resulting ester to a reaction for the elimination of sulphuric acid and, if the compound itself is required, then to an optional de esterification treatment. The esterification of the carboxyl group in the process of the invention can be effected by any of ordinary methods including, for example, a method in which alcohols, or their reactive derivatives, are reacted with KA 6643 B, or its reactive derivatives, at the carboxyl group thereof. Preferred esters include the methyl ester, ethyl ester, phenyl ester, benzyl ester, p nitrobenzyl ester, acetoxymethyl ester and the like. The reaction for the elimination of sulphuric acid may be carried out in an aqueous solution under from weakly acidic to strongly basic conditions at a temperature of from 3G 150 C for 0.5 10 hours. The acids which can be used in this reaction include mineral acids, such as phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid and the like, and organic acids, such as acetic acid, citric acid, oxalic acid and the like. Representative alkalis are sodium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, ammonia and the like. Alternatively, the elimination of sulphuric acid may be effected by contacting the ester of the compound of formula 11 with an ion exchange resin. Examples of suitable ion exchange resins include strongly acidic cation exchange resins, such as Amberlite IRA410 and IR 120 Rohm Haas Co., Ltd. , Dowex 50 Dow Chem., Co., Ltd. , and the like, and weakly acidic cation exchange resins such as Amberlite IRC 50,IRC 84 and CG 50, and Diaion WK 10 and WK 20 Mitsubishi Chem. Ind. Ltd. . The de esterificaton when required is conducted using known techniques such as hydrolysis, or hydrogenation. The isolation and purification of the compound of the formula I from the reaction solution can be effected by any ordinary methods. Preferably, there are used gel filtration, column chromatography, reversed phase chromatography, freeze drying, or the like, which methods may be used singly or in combination. The free carbapenem compound I so obtained may if desired, be converted into an alkali metal salt, an alkaline earth metal salt, a primary, secondary or tertiary amine salt, or a quaternary ammonium salt by conventional methods. The compound I of the invention which has been obtained as previously described can be converted into compounds showing antibacterial and B B lactamase inhibitory actions. For example, a compound represented by the formula III is obtained when the compound of the formula I is reducedEMI4.1 and a compound of the formula IV is obtained when the compound of the formula I is reacted with ethanethiol EMI4.2 The invention is illustrated by the following non limitative examples Example 1 20 mg of the disodium salt of KA 6643 B was reacted with 12 mg of p nitrobenzyl bromide in 0.75 mQ of dimethylformamide at room temperature for 2 hours.After completion of the reaction, the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure and the resulting residue was purified by preparative thin layer chromatography carrier silica HF254 solvent methylene chloride methanol 4 1 to obtain 12.3 mg of the paranitrobenzyl ester of KA 6643 B.
