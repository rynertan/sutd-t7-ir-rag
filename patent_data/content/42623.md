# Satellite communication system for switching formats with reference to super frame time slots.

## Abstract
On carrying out communication among a plurality of earth stations by the use of a satellite, super frame time slots are specified on board the satellite at a super frame period equal to a frame period multiplied by a predetermined natural number in order to synchronize the satellite and the earth stations with the super frame time slots. The satellite informs each earth station of the super frame time slots by generating super frame bursts specifying the super frame time slots. Alternatively, each earth station generates super frame bursts to enter the super frame time slots on the satellite. The satellite informs each earth station of the super frame time slots by preventing the super frame bursts from being returned to each station. At any rate, the satellite and each station change an on line sequence of operation to the other in synchronism with a specified one of the super frame time slots without any interruption of com munication.
