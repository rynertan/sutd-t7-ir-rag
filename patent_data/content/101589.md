# A valve for use in a suction line.

## Abstract
A valve 10 for use between a suction line 14 and a ca sing. In one embodiment, the casing is a teat cup assembly 12 . The valve or valve assembly comprises a valve housing 18 connected to the outlet of a teat cup assembly 12 . The housing 18 includes a nipple 40 formed in the bottom por tion thereof for connection to a milk suction line 14 . A ball member 16 is mounted inside the valve housing 18 and adapted to seat at the opening from the housing 18 into the nipple 40 when the interior of the housing 18 is exposed to atmospheric pressure. The valve assembly 12 further in cludes a plunger means 50 slidably mounted in the wall of the valve housing 18 , and the plunger means 50 is adapted to slide inwardly into the valve housing 18 when the pressure in the housing 18 falls below atmospheric pressure. The inward movement of the plunger means 50 is adapted to dislodge the ball member 16 from its seated position at the nippel opening.
