# Method for avoiding the corrosion of strippers in urea manufacturing plants.

## Abstract
A method for passivating the surface of strippers of urea manufacturing plants, where the temperatures are very high, where the pressures range from 120 to 240 Kg cm² and where the effluent process flow from the synthesis reactor undergoes one or more falling film evaporations, preferably in countercurrent with a driving gas consisting of NH₃ or CO₂, characterized by the fact that the passivation is carried out by means of a synergistic combination of oxygen, preferably injected into the bottom of at least one stripper, and of a second passivating agent, preferably injected into the process flow entering the head of at least one stripper, wherein said second passivating agent is injected in the liquid state or as a liquid solution, before or contempor aneously to the start of the evaporation.
