# Gelatinous articles and compositions.

## Abstract
A gelatinous tacky article of manufacture or a gela tinous adhesive composition is produced by heating to gether two components a and b to promote chemical reaction therebetween, component a being at least one polyhydric alcohol and component b being at least one material selected from naturally occurring high molecular weight polysaccharide gums, other than gum Karaya and resins which are a copolymer of a vinyl ether and an organic acid anhydride or its corresponding free acid. There are also described gelatinous tacky articles of manufacture or gelatinous adhesive compositions produced by heating together components a , b and c to promote chem ical reaction between component a and components b and c , component a being at least one polyhydric al cohol, component b being a resin which is a copolymer of a vinyl ether and an organic acid anhydride or its free acid, and component c being a material selected from gelatin and naturally occurring high molecular weight poly saccharide gums. Gelatinous tacky articles of manufacture and gela tinous adhesive compositions in accordance with this in vention are substantially less reliant upon supplies of gum Karaya than previously proposed similar such articles and compositions.
