# Integrated circuit isolation structure and method of making.

## Abstract
A void free isolated semiconductor substrate is de scribed which contains a pattern of substantially vertically sided trenches within a semiconductor body. The pattern of isolation trenches isolate regions of monocrystalline semi conductor material which may contain active and passive semiconductor devices. A first insulating layer 28, 30, 31 is located upon the sidewalls of the trenches. The base or bottom of the trenches is open to the monocrystalline semi conductor body 12 . A epitaxial layer 40 extending from the base of the trenches fills the pattern of trenches up to a level from the upper surface of the trenches as specified approximately by the equation y 0.34 x where y is the distance between the epitaxial layer and the top surface and x is the trench width. The preferred range for the trench width x is about 10 micrometers or less. A polycrystalline silicon layer 46 fills the additional portion of the pattern of trenches above the upper surfaces of the epitaxial layer 40 . A second insulating layer 48 is located on the polycrystalline silicon layer 46 within the trenches for isolation of the pattern of trenches from the ambient. it is the dense epitaxial monocrystalline semiconductor layer 40 which prevents the formation of voids within the pattern of trenches. The polycrystalline silicon layer 46 above the epitaxial layer 40 completely covers the undesirable sharp faceted structure at the top of the epitaxial semiconductor growth structure.
