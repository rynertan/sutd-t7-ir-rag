## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF HMG CoA REDUCTASEINHIBITORS WITH A 3,5 DIHYDROXYPENTANOATE SUBUNITBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Hypercholesterolemia is known to be one of the prime etiological components of cardiovascular disease such as atherosclerosis, and there is still no effective antihypercholesterolemic agent available that has found wide patient acceptance. The bile acid sequestrants seem to be moderately effective but they must be consumed in large quantities, i.e.several grams at a time and they are not very palatable. There are agents known, however, that are very active antihypercholesterolemic agents that function by limiting cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting the enzyme, HMG CoA reductase. These agents include the natural fermentation products compactin and mevinolin and a variety of semi synthetic and totally synthetic analogs thereof. These compounds have the following general structural formula EMI2.1 wherein R isEMI2.2 One group of totally synthetic analogs are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,375,475 and have the same general structural formula EMI2.3 wherein R isEMI3.1 In the usual course of synthesis of these lactones an intermediate ester and dihydroxy acid are encountered EMI3.2 ester dihydroxy acidEach of these entities, as well as the lactone, demonstrate antihypercholesterolemic activity in vivo, of comparable magnitude.However, for these compounds to manifest a useful degree of activity, it is essential that the compounds have the particular 3R 5S 3S 5R steric relationship shown in the structures. One of the prior art synthesis of these compounds comprises reduction of ss hydroxyketones la or lb EMI4.1 but the prior art methodology exhibited no stereoselectivity producing mixtures of the 3R,5R 3S,5S and 3S,5R 3R,5S racemates in approximately 1 1 ratios. The enormously expensive procedures required to separate these diastereomers and the need to discard the unwanted half of the product made these products commercially unattractive. Reduction of substrates of this type have been reported with sodium borohydride in U.S. Patent 4,255,444 and with zinc borohydride by Hsu et al inJ. Amer. Chem. Sec., 105, 593 601 1983 and byNarasaka et a1L in Chemistry Letters, 1415 1418 1980 who disclos e the use of tri n butylborane and sodium borohydride at low temperature. The latter system provided considerable stereoselectivity, but in the examples given none of the substrates included other functibnal groups which could conceivably participate in the reductive process. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of the intermediate ester in the synthesis of antihypercholesterolemic agents which contain a 4 hydroxy 3,4,5,6 tetrahydro 2H 2 pyran 2 one moiety. This process involves the stereoselective reduction of a ss diketone intermediate of the general structural formula 2 EMI5.1 and its preparation.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A process for the preparation of a compound represented by the following general formula I EMI5.2 wherein R is EMI6.1 wherein Q isEMI6.2 5 or R5 CH R5 is H or OH R6 is hydrogen or methyl and a, b, c, and d represent optional double bonds, especially where b and d represent double bonds or a, b, c and d are all single bonds orEMI6.3 wherein E is CH CH or CH2CH2 andR1, R2 and R3 are each selected from halo such as chloro, bromo or fluoro,C1 4alkyl, Cl 4haloalkyl, phenyl phenyl with one or more substituents independently selected from halo, C1 4alkyl, and C1 4alkoxy, orR O in which R4 is phenyl, halophenyl, or substituted phenyl C1 3alkyl wherein the substituents are selected from halo and C14 haloalkyl comprises 1 reacting a compound of the Formula II RCN II wherein R is defined above, with the zinc salt of the dianion from a compound of the Formula III EMI7.1 to afford a compound of the Formula IV EMI7.2 wherein R is defined above 2 hydrolyzing under acidic conditions the compound of the Formula IV to yield a compound of the Formula V EMI7.3 wherein R is defined above and 3 stereoselectively reducing the compound of the Formula V using a tri Cl 4alkyl borane, an activating agent and an alkali metal borohydride in an inert solvent at 300C to 100C followed by isolation of the compound of the Formula I . In a first preferred embodiment R is the radical A . Illustrative of this embodiment are the compounds of the formula I wherein R5 is H, R6 is H or CH3 and b and d represent double bonds or a, b, c and d are all single bonds. In a second preferred embodiment, R is the radical B . Illustrative of this embodiment are the compounds of the formula I wherein E is CH CH , R1 is in the 6 position and represents phenyl with 1 or 2 substituents independently selected from chloro, fluoro, methyl and methoxy and R2 and R3 are independently selected from halo and C13 alkyl in the 2 and 4 positions. In the most preferred embodiment, R is EMI8.1 The preparation of the compound of theFormula IV , an enamino ketoester, is accomplished by condensing the appropriately substituted nitrile II with the zinc salt of an acetoacetate ester dianion under standard reaction conditions.Specifically, the zinc salt of the dianion is formed under anhydrous conditions in an aprotic solvent utilizing a non nucleophilic base and then a zinc halide, such as zinc chloride is added. The appropriately substituted nitrile is then added at about ambient temperature and the reaction allowed to go to completion at ambient temperature. The preparation of the cc wound of the Formula V , a diketoester, utilizes a controlled ac hydrolysis of the enamino ketoester IV with an organic acid. Specifically, th enamino ketoester is dissolved in a water miscibl solvent and then an aqueous solution of the organic acid is added at ambient temperature. The preparation of the compound of theFormula I , a dihydroxyester, is accomplished by a gtereospecific reduction of the diketoester. This process comprises the treatment of compound of theFormula V with between 0.1 and 20 molecular equivalents of a tri Cl 4alkyl borane, such as tri ethyl , tri isopropyl , tri n butyl , triisobutyl or tri sec butylborane and an activating agent such as air or pivalic acid followed by the stereospecific reductio n of the dialkyl borinic acid ester with 1 2 molecular equivalents of an alkali metal borohydride, such as sodium borohydride. The process is conducted in an inert solvent such as a hydrocarbon, e.g. hexane, tolun, cyclohexane or the like a halocarbon, e.g. methylene chloride, chloroform, ethylene dichloride or the like a C1 4alkanol, e.g. methanol, ethanol,isopropanol or the like or an ether, e.g. diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2 dimethoxyethane or the like or mixtures thereof. The preferred solvent is a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and methanol in a ratio of about 3 6 volumes of tetrahydrofuran to 1 volume of methanol.When a catalytic amount of a tri C14alkyl borane, i.e. less than 1.0 molecular equivalents, is utilized in the reduction, and C1 4 alkanol must be employed in the solvent to generate the tri Cl 4alkyl borane and increase the s reoselectivity of the reaction. The reaction is conducted at temperatures between about 300C and 100C, preferably at about 200C for about 30 minutes to 3 hours. A preferred process comprises the treatment of Compound of the Formula V with between 0.10 and 1.0 molecular equivalents of a tri Cl 4alkyl borane and between 0.01 to 0.05 molecular equivalents of pivalic acid in an inert solvent and then after cooling to between 10 and 300C adding a C1 4 alkanol followed by the addition of 1 2 molecular equivalents of an alkali metal borohydride. Under these preferred condition greater than 95 percent of the product is in the desired stereochemical conformation. The reaction mixture is conveniently worked up by quenching into hydrogen peroxide water, and extracting the product into an organic solvent. The starting materials wherein R is the radical A are conveniently prepared from the corresponding aldehydes employing standard chemical transformations. The aldehydes may be prepared using the synthetic methods described by Hsu et al., J. Am.Chem. Soc., 1983, 105, pp. 593 601 in the total synthesis of compactin.
