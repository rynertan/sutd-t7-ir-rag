## Description
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUNDS The present invention relates to the novel, anti inflammatory compound, 4 amino i2 deoxy D ribofuranosyl l Himidazo ,5pyridine and to certain derivatives, to pharmaceutical formulations of the compound or its derivatives, and to their use in medicine. United States Patent No. 4 148 888 discloses 3 deazaadenosine as an antiviral and antifocal agent. Eurpoean Patent Application No. 79 103 947.2 discloses 3 deazaadenosine as an immunosuppressant. French Patent No. 1 324 011 discloses an improved chemical synthesis of nucleosides. These are stated to have antibotic activity and to be pharma cologically important but no activity is substantiated in the specification. Particular compounds within the generality are stated to have antibacterial, cytostatic, virus mutagenic and deoxyribonucleoside synthesis inhibiting proper ties. Furthermore, there is no indication in that patent, that any of the com pounds disclosed have anti inflammatory or immunosuppressive activity. It has now been suprisingly found that 3 deaza 2 deoxyadenosine, i.e. 4 amino. 1 2 deoxy pfl ribofuranosyl W imidazo E4, 5 pyridine and certain derivatives thereof possess anti inflammatory activity and are thus useful in the treatment of inflammation. In addition these compounds have been found to have immunosuppressive activity and are therefore useful whenever it is desirable to supress the immune response of a patient. Accordingly, the present invention provides, in a first aspect, the compound of formula I EMI2.1 the 5 phosphate ester thereof, organic esters of the compound or its 5 phosphate ester, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound or its esters. As used herein, the term organic esters refers to the esters formed between the compound of formula I or its 5 phosphate ester, and lower alkanoic acids and benzoic acid. The term lower alkanoic acids refers to alkanoic acids having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. As used herein, the term esters encompasses both organic esters and the 51 phosphate ester of the compound of formula I unless the context implies otherwise. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include salts of the 5 phosphate ester of the compound of formula I , e.g. the sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium salts and acid addition salts of the compound of formula I and its organic esters such as the salts derived from hydrochloric, hydriodic, sulphuric, phosphordc, acetic, p toluenesulphonic, methanesulphonic, maleic, lactic, citric, tartaric, succinic, oxalic, p chlorobenzenesulphonic, isethionic, gluconic, pantothenic and lactobionic acids. The mechanism of the anti inflammatory action of 4 amino 1 2 deoxy beta D ribofuranosy H imidazo 4 5 c pyridine is at present unknown. It is not antipyretic and has no analgesic activity per se and in this respect is like steroidal anti inflammatory drugs such as prednisolone and hydrocortisone and like these known drugs will give relief from pain in many clinical syndromes by reducing inflammation. 4 Amino l 2 deoxy beta D ribofuranosyl 1H imidazo ,5 pyridine does not inhibit prostaglandin metabolism in vitro through the lipoxgenase or cyclooxygenase pathway and is thus free of the side effects, particularly gastric damage and inhibition of platelet aggregation, associated with prostaglandin inhibitors such as aspirin. 4 A,mino 1 2 deoxy P D ribofur anosyl lH imidazo 5,5 pyridine is also free of the side effects of the antiinflammatory steroids and unlike compounds such as acetaminophen paracetmol does not cause liver damage in the animal models used. Although its mechanism of action is different to that of aspirin, 4 amino 1 2 deoxy 3 D ribofuranosyl 1 H imidazo r,5 i7 pyridine is similar to aspirin in that it has a long duration of action about 15 hours associated with a short half life. Thus the compound of formula I will require relatively infrequent administration for example twice daily and the problem of morning stiffness and associated pain and crippling effects in patients with arthritic conditions may be alleviated, in contrast to the shorter acting non steroidal and steroidal anti inflammatory agents which do not possess this property. In addition 4 amino I 2 deoxy Dribofuranosyl 1 H imidazo ,5 pyridine by virtue of its different mode of action to aspirin, salicylates and steroids, may be combined with such drugs to provide a sparing effect reducing the required dose of these drugs and hence the side effects associated therewith. The compound of formula I is also advantageous in possessing a high therapeutic index and thus is unlikely to present problems associated with accidential overdose. 4 Amino 2 deoxy D ribofuranosyl 1 H imidazo gs5 ji7 pyridine has the substantial advantage over known anti inflammatory drugs that it is highly soluble in water unlike, for instance, aspirin and prednisolone. The compound of formula I , 4 amino 1 2 deoxy D ribofuranosyl I H imidazo E4,5 pyridine is the most preferred anti inflammatory agent. The compound of formula I , its esters, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are also useful as immunosuppressive agents. The compound of formula I , its esters, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be prepared by various chemical methods already known in the art of nucleoside chemistry. However these methods are generally not stereochemically specific thus yielding a mixture of isomers of the desired product.Furthermore, the yields are often poor and the processes are not usually suitable for use on large scale. With certain purine bases the problem of synthesis has been overcome by means of an enzymatic pentosylation see for example EuropeanPatent Application No. 78 101 295.0 in which a purine nucleoside phosphorylase enzyme is used as the essential catalyst. Such a method has the advantages that it is sterochemically specific, gives improved yields of the nucleoside and is readily adaptable to use for large scale production. It is well known that enzymes have a high degree of specificity and that small changes in the substances s may markedly affect the enzymes ability to catalyse a reaction. However, it has been reported that modification of the purine base by removal of, or addition to the heterocyclic ring system of a nitrogen atom affects the ability of the base to act as a substrate for purine nucleoside phosphorylases. Thus a number of 1H imidazo 5 pyridines have been shown not to be substrates for mammalian purine nucleoside phosphorylase Townsend et. al., Lectures in Heterocyclic Chemistry Vol. 4, supplement to 3. Hetero.Chem. 15, S 19 to S 95, 197XD and 7 deazaadenosine, 7 deazainosine and 8 azaguanosine have been shown not to be substrates for microbial purine nucleoside phosphorylase Doskocil and Holy, Coll. Czeck. Chem. Commun., 42, 370, 1977a. Further it has been shown that lH imidazo 5,5 i7 pyridine nucleosides have conformations which differ from their purine counterparts Z udemann et. al., A. Naturforsch, 33C, 305, 1978 , May et. al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 98, 825 197X7 suggesting that purines and 1H imidazo 4,5 c pyridines may be expected to behave differently in the relevant enzyme systems. We have now suprisingly found that certain 4 substituted 1H imidazo ,5 pyridines are accepted as substrates by purine nucleoside phosphorylase and thus that 4 substituted 1 2 deoxy beta D ribofuranosyl 1H imidazo 4,5 c pyridines may be produced by an enzymatic method. Accordingly, the present invention provides, in a second aspect, a process for producing compounds of formula II EMI6.1 wherein R is halogen, amino or substituted amino, including protected amino, which process comprises reacting a 4 substituted I H imidazo E4, 5 pyridine base of formula III EMI6.2 wherein R is as defined above, with a 2 deoxyribosyl donor system comprising 2 deoxyribose 1 phosphate and a purine nucleoside phosphorylase enzyme. When R in a compound of formula III is amino, the product of the reaction is amino 1 t2 deoxy B D ribofuranosyl 1 H imidazo , 5 Jc pyridine, the compound of formula I . This particular reaction is not practicable by chemical means. When R in a compound of formula III is halogen or substituted amino, including protected amino, the reaction produces novel compounds which are of biological interests in themselves Furthermore, those compounds of formula 1I wherein R is halogen or protected amino are intermediates useful in the production of the compound of formula I as will become apparent below.Compounds of formula IIA3 EMI6.3 wherein Ri is halogen or substituted amino, including protected aminM,ualReahwlw As used herein the term substituted amino encompasses groups such as mono and di loweralkyl amino and other conventionally substituted amino groups including protected amino groups. The term protected amino refers to substituted amino groups which may readily be converted to amino groups by processes known in the art of organic chemistry, thus, in particular it embraces aralkylamino groups such as benzylamino and benzylhydrylamino groups. Compounds of formula IIA are of biological interest and those wherein R1 is halogen or protected amino are also useful as intermediates in the synthesis of the compound of formula I . For use in the production of compounds of formula II , 2 deoxyribose1 phosphate may be provided by synthetic processes known in themselves in the literature Twee, for instance, MacDonald, D.L., and Fletcher, H.G. Jr., 3. Amer. Chem. Soc., 82, 1832, 196it7. However, it can be convenient or even advantageous if the 2 deoxyribosyl moiety is generated enzymatically from a 2 deoxyribosyl moiet donor and inorganic phosphate. Although this reaction may be carried out separately and the product added to the reaction mixture, it has been found advantageous to carry out the generation of 2 deoxyribosel phosphate and the production of the compound of formula II in a one pot process by enzymatically forming the intermediate 2 deoxyribose 1 phosphate in situ. The net effect of the coupled reactions therefore is the transfer of the 2 deoxyribosyl moiety of the donor 2 deoxy ribonucleoside to the free 4 substituted lH imidazo g,5 i7 pyridine base, of formula III , thereby producing the desired 2 deoxyribonucleoside. The 2 deoxyribosyl moiety donor may be a purine 2 deoxyribdnucleosfde for example, adenine 2 deoxyribonucleoside, a pyrimidine 2 deoxyribonucleoside for example, uracil 2 deoxyribonucleoside, or a mixture of various 2 deoxyribonucleosides and non nucleosidic material. However, for the purposes of the present invention it is preferable that the 2 deoxyribosyl moiety donor is substantially free from non nucleosidic material and also that it is a pyrimidine 21 deoxyribonucleoside. The reasons for the preference for the use of a pyrimidine 2 deoxyribonucleoside as the donor are two fold. Firstly, the properties of the donor 2 deoxyribonucleoside are sufficiently different from those of the desired product to facilitate easy purification. Secondly, the donor base liberated during the course of the reaction is a pyrimidine rather than a purine which results in substantially less competition between the donor base and the acceptor base for the catalytic site on the enzyme directly involved in product synthesis purine nucleoside phosphorylase . The pyrimidine 2 deoxyribonucleoside donors may be prepared by any of the methods known in the art, fiee for instance, Drell, W., J. Amer. Chem.Soc., 75, 2506, 195g1. Purine 2 deoxyribonucleoside donors may be prepared by any of the methods known in the art, ee for instance, Hotckiss, R.D., 3. BioL Chem, 175, 315, 194s7 It has been found that both reactions described hereinabove are catalysed by various enzymes which are present in microorganisms and mammalian tissues.The phosphorolysis of the donor 2 deoxyribonucleoside is catalysed, for instance, by purine nucleoside phosphorylase if the donor is a purine 2 deoxyribonucleoside, or by pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase if the donor is a pyrimidine 2 deoxyribonucleoside. The second reaction, by which the desired 4 substituted 1H imidazo 0i,5 E7 pyridine 2 deoxyribonucleoside is synthesised from the Mreoe g v base of formula III and 2 deoxyribose l phosphate, is catalysed by purine nucleoside phosphorylase. The required 2 deoxyribosyl tranferring enzyme system therefore may consist of the latter phosphorylase alone, or in combination with any one of the former type, if the 2 deoxyribosyl donor is a 2 deoxyribonucleoside of a pyrimidine or pyrimidine analogue. As previously stated, it has been found that the enzymes required for the catalysis of the reactions employed in the process of the present invention occur in microorganisms as well as mammalian tissues. For the purposes of the present invention, however, aerobic bacteria such as B. stearothermophilus and especially E. colli B, which is freely available from the American type culture collection under deposition No. ATCC 11303, were found to be excellent sources of such enzymes. The bacteria which provide the enzymes may be cultured under a variety of conditions. However, media which contained large quantities of glucose were found to be undesirable since the levels of the nucleoside phosphorylase enzymes in the bacterial cells were depressed in the presence of glucose. It has been found that crude enzyme preparations are less suitable than purified preparations. This is due to the fact that crude preparations contain troublesome nucleic acids as well as enzymes other than those required for the process of the present invention. The extraneous enzymes in crude preparations catalyse undesirable alterations of substrates and products, and may even cause proteolysis of the required enzymes themselves. These factors decrease not only the yield of the desired products but also the ease with which they can be isolated from reaction mixtures. In most cases therefore, it is desirable to purify the crude enzyme preparations before addition to the reaction mixture. This may be achieved in a number of ways known in themselves in the art. For instance, the desired enzymes may be separated or concentrated from extracts of the cells by a combination of treatment with calcium phosphate gel and ion exchange chromatography. Alternatively the cell extract may be treated with streptomycin or nuclease DNA ase RNA ase prior to calcium phosphate gel treatment or by nuclease DNA ase RNA ase treatment prior to ion exchange chromatography.Nuclease treatment is particularly advantageous if performed under dialyzing conditions at 40 to 400C, preferably at 250C. Gel filtration has been found to be especially useful as a late or final step in the purification when only relatively small volumes of liquid are involved. The enzymes, provided in a sufficiently effective state and concentration, may then be used to catalyse the aforementioned reactions. A typical reaction mixture contains a 2 deoxyribosyl moiety donor, and 4 substituted lH imidazo g,5 s pyridine base, inorganic phosphate, for example dipotassium hydrogen phosphate K2HP04 , and the appropriate enzyme or enzymes in an aqueous medium or in a medium containing up to 50 of an organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, acetone, methylethylketone, ethylacetate, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dim ethyl sulfoxide, trichloromethane or cellosolve. The preferred concentration of organic solvent is 5 v v. The inorganic phosphate concentration can be from 0.001 mM to 2,000 mM, preferably 1 to 200 mM.The reaction is performed at near neutral pH, that is in the pH range of about 5 to 9, preferably 6.0 to 8.5 and at a temperature of 3 to 70 C, preferably 25 to 450C. Mild conditions are preferable since the glycosidic bond of 4 substituted lH imidazo g,5 d7 pyridine 2 deoxyribosides is labile under acidic conditions, particularly at elevated temperatures, and the enzymes are unstable at extremes of temperature and pH. The preferable concentration of the enzyme is a function of the substrate efficiency of the particular 2 deoxyribosyl moiety donors and acceptors used and the length of time that one wishes to allow the reaction to proceed. In some cases it is preferable to use larger amounts of the enzyme in order to reduce the reaction time because of the instability of certain of the products in aqueous solution.The purity of the enzymes used is a question of convenience. Crude extracts will catalyze the desired reactions but the yield of product is usually less and its isolation is more difficult than when purified enzymes are used for the reasons explained above. If the enzymes used are stored as ammonium sulphate suspensions, they are preferably added to the reactions as centrifuged pellets from the suspensions rather than as the whole suspensions. Enzymes may be salvaged from reaction mixtures, for instance by batch adsorption onto DEAE cellulose after the reaction has reached a satisfactory point and subsequent removal from the soluble components of the reaction mixture by centrifugation or by gel filtration of reaction mixtures. In some cases, enzymes may be recycled by virtue of the fact that the bulk of the product precipitates out from the reaction mixture and upon its removal, more starting material may be added to the reaction fluid in order that product formation may be resumed. Usually it is preferable that all the components are contained in suspension or solution but when highly soluble substrates are used an alternative procedure wherein a solution of the reaction mixture components except enzymes is pumped slowly through a column containing a stationary phase to which the appropriate enzymes have been fixed, for instance, when the enzymes are adsorbed to a DEAE cellulose may be preferable. It has been found that, if it is so desired, enzymes may be conserved by allowing reactions to proceed for extended periods of time, for example, up to thirty days or longer. However, for reaction mixtures which are incubated for more than one day it is desirable to have an antimicrobial agent, for example sodium or potassium azide or toluene, in the reaction mixture, unless the reaction mixture is sterilised by filtration or some other technique known to the art. The desired 4 substituted lH imidazor,5 si7 pyridine 2 deOxyribosides may be recovered or isolated by any of the known means for separating mixtures of chemical compounds into individual compounds. For example, the separation can be effected by utilizing differences in the solubilities in various solvents between the desired end product and impurities, the difference in their distribution coefficients between two solvent layers, the difference in their adsorbabilities to an adsorbent such as ion exchange resins, the difference in their rates of passage through cross linked resins such as polyacrylamide gels, or the difference in their crystallizabilities from a solvent. In cases where the product crystallizes out of the reaction mixture, it can be collected by centrifugation or by filtration with or without a filter aid.In practice, these means for separation or isolation are carried out in combination or repeatedly depending on the desired purity and state of the products. As mentioned above the compound of formula I may be produced from compounds of formula IIA wherein R1 is halogen or protected amino by conversion of the 4 substituent to an amino group. According to the present invention in another aspect there is therefore provided a process for producing 4 amino 1 2 deoxy 85 D ribofuranosyl lH imidazo ffi5 d7 pyridine which comprises the conversion of the 4 substituent of a compound of formula IV , EMI13.1 EMI13.2 wherein R2 is halogen or protected amino, into an amino group. When R2 is halogen this conversion may be effected by conventional means such as ammonolysis using ammonia at elevated temperatures and pressure or using hydrazine. In the latter case the 4 hydrazino derivative is formed and then reduced, advantageously using Raney nickel in a suitable solvent such as oxygen free water. It has been found particularly convenient to carry out this conversion by first introducing a protected amino group at the 4 position and reducing this afford the compound of formula 1 . Thus, for instance, the 4 halogeno compounds of formula IV may be treated with benzylamine or benzhydrylamine, i.e. diphenylmethyl amine. Reduction may be effected by conventional means including reduction using Raney nickel, metallic sodium in liquid ammonia or hydrogen gas and an appropriate catalyst, such as palladium hydroxide, in a suitable solvent, such as an alcohol. Compounds of formula II may also be produced by chemical methods of pentosylation known in the art of nucleoside synthesis. Accordingly, the present invention, in a further aspect, provides a process for producing a compound of formula II as hereinbefore defined which process comprises reacting a compound of formula V EMI13.3 wherein R is halogen, amino or substituted amino, including protected amino and Q is a leaving atom or group capable of being replaced with a 2 deoxyribosyl moiety, with a compound of formula VI EMI14.1 wherein A is an acyloxy group or a halogen atom and Z is a suitable protecting group. Suitably, Q is a hydrogen or metal atom or a trialkylsilyl group and preferably is a trimethylsilyl group. If R is to be an amino or mono substituted amino, i.e. if it will have a hydrogen atom bonded to the nitrogen atom, in the desired compound of formula II and Q is a trialkylsilyl group, then in the compound of formula V R will also bear a trialkylsilyl substituent which may be removed by a subsequent hydrolysis step as is known in the art. When Q is hydrogen, A is suitably an acyloxy group, preferably the residue of a lower alkanoic acid and especially an acetoxy group. When Q is a trialkylsilyl group, A is suitably a halogen atom and preferably a chlorine atom. Z is suitably the residue of a carboxylic acid, preferably an aromatic carboxylic acid such as para toluoic acid i.e. para methyl benzoic acid . It will be appreciated that compounds of formula II wherein R is a substituted amino group including compounds of formula IV wherein R2 is protected amino may be produced by the enzymatic or chemical methods of pentosylation described above either directly from the appropriately substituted compound of formula III or V , or by first producing a compound of formula fl wherein R is a halogen atom and then converting the 4 halogeno substituent to the appropriate substituted amino group. Esters of the compound of formula I and salts of the compound or its esters, may be produced by standard chemical methods. Compounds of formula III wherein R is chlorine or amino, are known and may be prepared by methods known in the art, such as those described by Salemink and Van der Want, Rec. Trav. Chim., 68, 1013 1949 Mizuno et. al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., Tokyo , 12, 866, 1964 Montgomery and Hewson, J. Med. Chem., 88, 1263, 1969 . Further compounds of formula III may be produced by chemical means analogous to those used for converting compounds of formula 11 wherein R is halogen to those wherein R is amino or substituted amino as described above. Compounds of formula IV are produced by direct pentosylation of appropriately substituted compounds of formula Ill or V or by conversion of a compound of formula 11 wherein R is halogen by methods described above. Compounds of formula V wherein R3 is chloro or amino are known in the art. Further compounds of formula V may be prepared by conversion of the 4 substituent as described above. Compounds of formula VI are also known any may be prepared by known methods, Ree for instance Hoffer, M., Chem. Ber., 93, 2777, 1960 , Ness, R.K. et al, J. Org. Chem., 26, 2895, 1 963 , Robins M.G. and Robins R.K. in Synthetic Procedures in Nucleic Acid Chemistry, Vol. 1, W.W. Zorback and R.S. Tipson Eds., Interscience Publishers, NY, NY, 1968 p.519 andRobins, M.J. and Robins, R.K., 3. Amer. Chem. Soc., 87, 4934, 1965S7. The compounds of formula I , its esters and pharmaceutically acceptable salts are useful in both short and long term treatment of inflammation. The compound of formula I has also been demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of lymphocyte mediated cytolysis and thus to have immunosuppressive activity. While the compound of formula I , its esters and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound or its esters may be administered as the raw chemical, it is preferred that they be administered as pharmaceutical formulations. Accordingly the present invention, in a further aspect, provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of formula I , an ester or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound or an ester thereof, hereinafter referred to as the active compound , in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A carrier is a material useful for administering the active compound and must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The pharmaceutical formulations are prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy all of which involve bringing into association the active compound and the carrier therefor. 4 A mino 1 4A Amino 1 2 deoxy p D ribofuranosyl 1 H imidazo tgg,5 .f7 pyridine is effective as an anti inflammatory agent not only orally and systemically but also locally and is thus particularly suitable for topical administration. The term topical as applied herein relates to the use of the active ingredient incorporated in a suitable pharmaceutical carrier, and applied at the site of the disease for exertion of local action. Included within the scope of topical formulations are ophthalmic formulations. Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for topical administration may be presented in anhydrous forms such as ointments, lotions, jellies, sprays, aerosols and bath oils. The term ointment includes formulations including creams having oleaginous, absorption, water soluble and emulsion type bases, for example petrolatum, lanolin, polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof. Ointments are semi solid materials with the active compound dispersed therein. These and other topical formulations enable the active ingredient to be applied and retained locally at the site of the disease. Topical formulations may contain a concentration of active compound of from 0.05 to 2 w w preferably 0.1 to 1 w w most preferably 0.2 to 0.5 wiw. Other pharmaceutical formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, and parenteral administration although of these oral is preferred. The formulations may, where appropriate, be conveniently presented in discrete dosage units and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. A convenient unit dose formulation contains the active compound in an amount of from 5 mg to 250 mg, preferably 10 to 100 mg, most preferably about 50 mg to be taken once or several times daily. Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for oral administration wherein the carrier is a solid are most preferably presented as unit dose formulations such as boluses, capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined anount of the active compound. A tablet may be made by compression or moulding optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active compound in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Tablets may be optionally coated and, if uncoated, may be optionally scored. Capsules may be be prepared by filing the active compound either alone or in admixture with one or more accessory ingredients, into the capsule cases and the sealing them in the usual manner.Cachets are analogous to capsules wherein the active compound together with any accessory ingredient s are sealed in a rice paper envelope. Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for oral administration wherein the carrier is a liquid may be presented as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid, or as an oil in water or water in oil liquid emulsion. Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for rectal administration wherein the carrier is a solid are most preferably presented as unit dose suppositories. Suitable carriers include cocoa butter and other material commonly used in the art, and the suppositories may be conveniently formed by admixture of the active compound with the softened or melted carrier s followed by chilling and shaping in moulds. Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for parenteral administration include sterile solutions or suspensions of the active compound in aqueous or oleaginous vehicles. Such preparations are conveniently presented in unit dose or multi dose containers which are sealed after introduction of the formulation until required for use. It should be understood that in addition to the aforementioned carrier ingredients the pharmaceutical formulations described above may include, as appropriate, one or more additional carrier ingredients such as diluents, buffers, flavouring agents, binders, surface active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives including anti oxidants and the like, and substances included for the purpose of rendering the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. For the treatment of inflammatory conditions the active compound may be administered orally or parenterally to man at dosages in the range of 0.05 to 10 mg kg body weight of recipient per day, particularly 0.2 to 5 mg kg per day, most preferably 0.3 to 1 mg kg per day, calculated as the free 2 deoxy riboside. In contrast immunosuppression requires more than 10 mg kg body weight of recipient per day. Accordingly there is provided as a further aspect of the present invention a method for the treatment of inflammation comprising the administration to a human or other mammal suffering from an inflammatory condition the compound of formula I , or an ester thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound or an ester thereof. By the term inflammation is meant the reactive state of hyperaemia and exudation from its blood vessels, with consequent redness, heat, swelling and pain, which a tissue enters in response to physical or chemical injury or bacrerial invasions. Clinical conditions with which inflammation is associated, and hence for which an anti inflammatory agent is indicated, include for example arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, postoperative inflammation, dental inflammation, acute and chronic ocular inflammatory diseases such as conjunctivitis. There is also provided, as a further aspect of the invention, a method for the susppression of the immune response in a human or other mammal comprising the administration of an immune response suppressing, non toxic amount of the compound of formula I or an ester thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound or an ester thereof. Conditions where suppression of the immune response is desirable include auto immune diseases such as Lupus erythematosis, Haemolytic anameia, Ulcerative Colitis and Nephrosis and in the prevention of rejection of foreign cells such as grafts including organ transplants. The invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following examples which are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way.Example 1 4 A mi no 1 2 deoxy D ribofuranosyI 1 tl imidazo , 5 2c pyridine The reaction mixture consisted of an aqueous suspension 26.9 ml of 4 amino I H imidazo 4, pyridine dihydrochloride 2.4 mmoles , 2 deoxythymidine 7.2 mmoles , dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 2.7 mmoles , potassium azide 0.13 mmoles , 1,120 International Units I.U. of E.coli. purine nucleoside phosphorylase European Patent Application No. 78 101 295.0 and 3,750 I.U.of E.coli. thymidine phosphorylase U.S. Patent No. 4 097 337 .
