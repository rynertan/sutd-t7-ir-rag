Alloy skeleton metal sulfide hydrogenation catalysts that are corrosion resistant are known. See,U.S. Patent 2,402,626. Other alloy catalysts are also known. See, for example, U.S. Patents 3,519,575 3,052,739 3,962,139 3,147,154 and 3,455,845.

In contrast, the catalyst of the present invention comprise a catalytic metal carbon hydrogen composition deposited on a low surface area support which provides a means of catalyst dispersion and facilitates catalyst recovery. The metal containing deposit or coating provides the high surface area or extended catalyst surface for the desired catalytic reactions.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention, there is provided a catalyst comprising a composition comprising a metal component, carbon and hydrogen deposited on a support selected from the group consisting of solid metals and metal alloys of metals of Groups IB, II, III,IV, VB, VIB, V113, VIII and mixtures thereof of thePeriodic Table of Elements, said support having a surface area of less than about five square meters per gram and the metal constituent of said metal component of said composition being selected from the group consisting of metals of Groups II, III, IV, V, VIB, VIIB, VIII and mixtures thereof of the Periodic Table of Elements, and said composition having a surface area of at least about 50 m2 g.

For example, the gas may be hydrogen, argon, helium, nitrogen, steam, air, carbon dioxide, etc. The molten alloy first may be atomized into an inert gas followed by steam treating or air steam treatment. The formation of metal or metal alloy powders by atomization is well known in the art. See, for example, the book by W. D. Jones,Fundamental Principles of Powder Metallurgy, London Edward Arnold Publishers, 1960, pages 213 238.

Suitable metal components of the composition that is deposited on the support are catalytically active components of metals of Groups II, III, IV, V, VIB, VIIB,VIII and mixtures thereof. Preferably the metal component is a component of vanadium, tungsten, molybdenum, nickel, cobalt, iron and mixtures thereof. Suitable concentration of the metal component on the support includes from about 0.01 to about 10.0 weight percent, preferably from about 0.1 to about 5 weight percent, most preferably from about 0.5 to about 2.0 weight percent, calculated as the elemental metal, based on the total catalyst. The high surface area supported catalysts of the present invention are made by utilizing a hydrocarbonaceous oil boiling at atmospheric pressure above about 221 C., preferably above about 260 C., more preferably above about 343 C. These hydrocarbon oils may be derived from any sources such as petroleum, oil shale, tar sands and oils derived from coal liquefaction processes. The Conradson carbon residue of these oils will generally range up to about 50 weight percent, preferably below about 30 weight percent as to Conradson carbon residue, see ASTM test D 189 65 . By way of example, suitable hydrocarbon oils for the process of the present invention include virgin gas oil, vacuum gas oil, coker gas oil, visbreaker gas oil, petroleum distillates, white oils, hydrocarbon oils derived from coal liquefaction processes, coal liquefaction bottoms, synthetic polymer oils such as ethylene oligomers, synthetic and natural waxes, etc. Preferably, the oil is a mixture of hydrocarbons boiling at atmospheric pressure, in the range of about 343 to 565 C.More preferably, the hydrocarbon chargestock comprises at least 50 percent of the Conradson carbon in the form of a hydrocarbon stream comprising more than 1 weight percent Conradson carbon residue, such as residua, whole crudes, etc. To the hydrocarbon oil are added the support of the present invention and a thermally decomposable metal compound, wherein the metal constituent is selected from the group consisting of Groups II, III,IV, VIB, VII3, VIII and mixtures thereof of the PeriodicTable of Elements. A sufficient amount of a single thermally decomposable metal compound or of a mixture of metal compounds is added to the oil to provide a ratio of atoms of Conradson carbon of the oil chargestock to atom of metal constituent of the therm ally decomposable compound or compounds of less than about 750 to 1, preferably less than about 600 to 1, more preferably less than 100 to 1.Suitable ranges of ratio of atoms of Conradson carbon of the oil to atom of metal constituent of the thermally decomposable metal compound include an atomic ratio ranging from about 2 to 1 to about 600 to 1, preferably from about 2 to 1 to about 300 two 1, more preferably from about 4 to 1 to about 100 to 1. Thus the amount of thermally decomposable metal compound added will vary depending on theConradson carbon of the oil feed actually used so as to provide the ratio required to obtain high surface area catalytic solids. By the expression ratio of atoms of Conradson carbon of the oil charge stock to atoms of metal constituent is intended herein the following relation weight of Conradson carbon residue 12 weight of the metal constituent of the thermally decomposable compound atomic weight of the metal Suitable thermally decomposable metal compounds convertible under preparation conditions to solid, high surface area deposit include 1 inorganic metal compounds such as carbonyls, halides, oxyhalides, polyacids such as isopolyacids and heteropolyacids e.g., phosphomolybdic acid, and molybdosilicic acid 2 metal salts of organic acids such as acyclic and alicyclic aliphatic carboxylic acids and thiocarboxylic acids containing two or more carbon atoms e.g., naphthenic acids aromatic carboxylic acids toluic acid sulfonic acids e.g., toluenesulfonic acid sulfinic acid mercaptans xanthic acids phenols, di and polyhydroxy aromatic compounds 3 organo metallic compounds such as metal chelates, e.g., with 1,3 diketones, ethylenediamine, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, phthalocyanines, etc. 4 metal salts of organic amines such as aliphatic amines, aromatic amines and quaternary ammonium compounds. The metal constituent of the thermally decomposable metal compound that is convertible to d solid, high surface area deposit is selected from the group consisting of Groups II, III, IV, V, VIB, VIIB, VIII and mixtures thereof of the Periodic Table of Elements, that is zinc, antimony, bismuth, titanium, cerium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese, rhenium, iron, cobalt, nickel and the noble metals including platinum, iridium, palladium, osmium, ruthenium and rhodium. The preferred metal constituent of the thermally decomposable compound is selected from the group consisting of molybdenum, tungsten, vanadium, chromium, cobalt, titanium iron nickel and mixtures thereof.Preferred compounds of the given metals include the salts of acyclic straight or branched chain aliphatic carboxylic acids, salts of alicyclic aliphatic carboxylic acids, heteropolyacids, carbonyls, phenolates and organoamine salts. When the thermally decomposable metal compound is added to the hydrocarbonaceous oil, it first dissolves or disperses in the oil and subsequently, under catalyst preparation conditions herein described, is converted to a solid high surface area catalyst. The oil comprising the thermally decomposable metal compound is heated at a temperature ranging from about 199 C to about 571 C, preferably at a temperature ranging from about 260 C to about 482 C, more preferably at a temperature ranging from about 316 C to about 44t9 C, at a pressure of either atmospheric or superatmospheric, preferably at superatmospheric pressure in the presence of a gas selected from the group consisting of a hydrogencontaining gas, a hydrogen sulfide containing gas, and a gas comprising hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide, preferably at least 50 psig of such gas. More preferably, the gas comprises hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide. The hydrogen sulfide may comprise from about 1 to 90 mole percent, more preferably from about 2 to 50 mole percent of the hydrogen containing gas. Suitable total pressures in the catalyst preparation zone when the heating step is being conducted include a pressure ranging up about 5000 psig, preferably a pressure ranging from about 100 to about 3000 psig. Suitable reaction times include from about 5 minutes to about 4 hours, preferably from about 10 minutes to 2 hours. Contact of the solution under catalyst preparation conditions in the reaction zone with the hydrogen sulfide containing gas converts the metal compound to the corresponding metal catalyst.The oil containing the solids is removed from the catalyst preparation zone. The solids may be separated from the oil by conventional means, for example, by settling or centrifuging or filtration of the slurry.The recovered solids are the high surface area supported catalysts of the present invention. The surface area of coating or deposit on these catalysts will be at least about 50 m2 g and range from about 60 to about 600 m2 g, usually from about 100 to about 500 m2 g. The total measured surface area of the supported catalyst that is, deposit support will be at least about 0.5 m2 g, and range from about 0.5 to about 60 m2 g, usually from about 1.0 to 30 m2 g.Generally, the high surface area supported catalysts of the present invention comprise at least 0.01 to 10 weight percent, preferably above about 0.1 to 5 weight percent, more preferably from about 0.5 to about 2 weight percent of the metal constituent, calculated as elemental metal, corresponding to the metal constituent of the added thermally decomposable metal compound, said weight being based on the total high surface area catalyst. The catalyst of the present invention may be prepared either in a batch process or in a continuous type operation. Alternatively, the high surface are.composition comprising the metal carbon hydrogen may be preformed by utilizing the above given thermally decomposable compounds, hydrocarbonaceous feed and preparation conditions except the omission of the low surface area support. The low surface area support is subsequently added to hydrocarbonaceous oil comprising the preformed high surface area composition or the preformed metalcarbon hydrogen containing composition is subsequently mixed with a hydrocarbonaceous oil of the same type as the oil suitable for the formation of the high surface area composition and with the low surface are support of the present invention.The mixture is heated at the same temperature and conditions used in the formation of the metal carbon hydrogen composition in the presence of a hydrogen containing gas which may additionally comprise hydrogen sulfide for a time sufficient to deposit the metal carbon hydrogen composition on the low surface area support and thereby form a high surface area supported catalyst of the present invention. The solids that are recovered from the reaction product of the catalyst preparation zone are suitable as catalysts, catalyst components or catalyst supports for use in a number of chemical processes and hydrocarbon treating and conversion processes such as catalytic cracking, hydrogenation, hydrogen refining, hydrodesulfurization, hydrocracking, reforming, etc., especially for hydroprocesses. The term hydroprocess is intended herein to mean a process conducted in the presence of hydrogen in which the hydrocarbonaceous oil feed is either upgraded refined without substantial change in the boiling range of the oil or a process in which the hydrocarbonaceous oil is converted to lower boiling hydrocarbon products. The metal carbon hydrogen coated support may be produced ex situ and added as a preformed metal component carbon hydrogen coated support to the chargestock to be treated or the desired metal compound may be added to the hydrocarbonaceous oil chargestock containing the support and the decomposition of the metal compound may be made to occur in situ in the oil chargestock by heating the oil comprising the support and the metal compound to an elevated temperature while adding a hydrogen containing gas or a hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide containing gas to the mixture. The catalyst of the present invention may be used in a slurry process, in a fluidized bed process, in a fixed bed process, in a moving bed process, in an ebullating bed process, etc. It is particularly suited for use in slurry processes since recovery of the catalyst could be performed by gravity separation, magnetic filtration or a combination of both of these methods. The particle size of the catalyst may suitably range from about 0.5 micron to about 150 microns in diameter, preferably from about 1 to about 50 microns, most preferably from about 1 to about 10 microns in diameter. The smaller particle sizes will be preferred for slurry type processes whereas particle sizes above 100 microns in diameter would be suitable for fluidized bed type processes. The catalysts of the present invention are suitable for use in hydrocarbon treating processes and coal liquefaction processes. The catalysts are particularly suited for hydroconversion of hydrocarbonaceous oils and coal. The operating conditions to be employed in the hydrocarbon treating processes are well known and will vary with the particular reaction desired.

Alternatively, a preformed coating or the total catalyst may be composited with other known catalytic components. Thus, a recovered high surface area composition or the total catalyst may be composited in a conventional manner with metal constituents that are known to catalyze a given process. The compositing of the catalyst with the additional catalytic components may be performed by impregnating the preformed high surface area composition or total catalyst comprising one or more metal constituents with catalytic components or precursors in any. conventional way, such as contact of the solids with a dissolved salt of the desired metal or metals or by a method such as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,959,179. The compositing of the preformed high surface area composition or total catalyst may be performed by depositing a desired catalytic metal component or precursor of a catalytic metal component on the surface of the solids, including contacting of the solids with vapor phase materials. Furthermore, physical mixtures of two or more different performed high surface area compositions or total catalysts may be used in certain processes, for example, a recovered catalyst having one or more metal constituents which is different from another recovered catalyst wherein different initial thermally decomposable metal compounds were used. The catalyst of the present invention may be used in a moving bed, fixed bed, fluidized bed, ebullating bed, suspension transferline or in slurry processes.PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The following examples are presented to illustrate the invention,Example 1 Preparation of catalyst comprising molybdenum carbon hydrogen composition coated on 410 stainless steel powder Runs 476, 477 . A mixture consisting of 8.Og of molybdenum naphthenate 6.0 weight percent molybdenum , 92g of light Arab vacuum gas oil and 12.50g of 325 mesh 410 stainless steel was charged to a 300 cc autoclave, which was pressured with 2000 psig hydrogen at room temperature, heated to 316 C and held for one hour with stirring. The autoclave was cooled below 93.33 C and vented while further cooling to room temperature.The autoclave was then pressured with 100 psig of H2S and then to 2100 psig with hydrogen, after which it was heated at 399 C for two hours. After cooling, the autoclave was vented and the contents filtered. The solids were thoroughly washed with hot toluene followed by hot heptane and then dried in a vacuum oven at 90 C for one hour. The recovered solids, which are supported catalysts in accordance with the present, invention, weighed l3.93g and had the following properties pore 2 volume, 0.13 cc g total surface area, 21.5 m carbon, 0.95 weight percent hydrogen, 0.15 weight percent. The weight percent of coating with molybdenum calculated as MoS2 based on the total catalyst was 6.85 weight percent. The surface area of the stainless steel 2 powder was determined to be 0.09 m g and the pore volume, 0.01 cc g. From this determination and the analyses of the supported catalyst, it was calculated that the surface area of the coating was 254 m2 g and the pore volume was 1.31 cc g.Example 2 Preparation of catalyst comprising molybdenum carbon hydrogen composition coated on 410 stainless steel Run 470 . A preparation similar to that described inExample 1 was performed except that 50.0g of 410 stainless steel powder was added. The recovered solids, which were supported catalysts in accordance with the present invention, weighed 53.28g and had the following properties pore volume, 0.02 cc g total surface area, 2.63 m2 g carbon, 0.35 weight percent hydrogen, 0.06 weight percent. Electron photomicrographs showed that the catalyst comprised the high surface area molybdenumcarbon hydrogen composition of Example3 coated on the stainless steel support. The weight percent Mo C H coating, with Mo calculated as MoS2, was 1.92 weight percent based on the weight of 410 stainless steel charged. From the analyses, it was calculated that the coating had a surface area of 133 m2 g and a pore volume of 0.52 cc g.Example 3 Preparation of unsupported high surface area molybdenum hydrogen carbon composition Runs 471, 472 . This is not an example of a catalyst of the invention. A preparation similar to the one described inExample 1 was performed except that the 410 stainless steel powder was not added. The weight of the recovered solids was 0.96g This preparation was repeated, and the two solids were combined for analyses and testing. The solids, which are not in accordance with the supported catalyst of the present invention, had the following properties pore volume, 2.17 cc g surface area, 272 m2 g carbon, 10.07 weight percent hydrogen, 1.24 weight percent molybdenum, 50 weight percent. Electron photomicrographs showed that the unsupported catalyst comprises rough, irregular particles of 10 to 250 microns in size.Example 4 Preparation of catalyst comprising molybdenum carbon hydrogen coated on 410 stainless steel powder starting with dispersion of 410 stainless steel and alcoholic phosphomolybdic acid in gas oil Run 56 R 41 . A solution of 1.02g of phosphomolybdic acid 2H3P04. 20Mo03. 48H20 in 4.48g of anhydrous isopropyl alcohol and 92.78g of light Arab vacuum gas oil was charged to a300 cc autoclave along with 50.02g of 325 mesh Tyler 410 stainless steel powder. A gas charge comprising 100 psig H2S and 1900 psig hydrogen was added at room temperature, and the autoclave was then heated to 399 C and held at this temperature with stirring for a period of two hours. Upon cooling below 93.33 C, the autoclave was vented and the gases were measured and collected for compositional analysis by mass spectrometry. The contents of the autoclave were filtered to recover the molybdenum carbon hydrogen coated alloy catalyst, which was washed with hot toluene followed by hot n heptane to remove adhering oil, and then vacuum oven dried for 30 minutes at 90 C.The supported catalytic solids that were recovered weighed 51.10 grams and are catalysts in accordance with the present invention. The filtered gas oil product was analyzed for sulfur content so that a first cycle hydrodesulfurization activity of the catalyst could be evaluated. Product sulfur measured 0.764 weight percent compared to 2.4 weight percent sulfur for the gas oil feed.Example 5 Preparation of catalysts comprising molybdenum coated on 410 stainless steel starting with phosphomolybdic acid impregnated 410 stainless steel dispersed in gas oil Run 56 R 75 . This is not an example of a catalyst in accordance with the present invention. A solution of 1.0g of phosphomolybdic acid PMA in 9.0g of anhydrous isopropyl alcohol was added dropwise with stirring to 50g of stainless steel powder.The 10g of solution was just sufficient to wet the powder. The mixture was then vacuum oven dried at 90 C for one hour to produce 50.66g of dry, phosphomolybdic acid coated 410 stainless steel powder. The dry powder and 96.19g of light Arab vacuum gas oil were charged to a 300 cc autoclave, which was pressued to 100 psig with H2S and then up to 2000 psig with hydrogen. After a stirred, two hour contact at 399 C, the autoclave was cooled, vented and the contents filtered to recover the molybdenum coated catalyst. Washed free of adhering oil and vacuum oven dried, the catalyst was found to weigh 52.10g. It is not a catalyst of the present invention. The filtered product oil was found to contain 1.53 weight percent sulfur. This is considerably higher than that obtained for the product oil in Example 4. Therefore, it can be seen that impregnating the molybdenum component on the metal alloy support prior to decomposition in gas oil gave an inferior catalyst relative to that obtained by dispersing the metal.component catalyst precursor in gas oil and then conducting the decomposition in the presence of the alloy support as described in Example 4 .Example 6 Preparation of unsupported high surface area molybdenum carbon hydrogen composition Run 56 R 47 . A 300 cc autoclave containing a mixture of 8.10g of molybdenum naphthenate and 92.5g of vacuum gas oil was charged with 100 psig H2S and 1900 psig hydrogen at room temperature. The autoclave was heated to 399 C and held for two hours with stirring. Upon cooling below 93.33 C, the autoclave pressure was released and the contents were filtered to recover a molybdenum carbon hydrogen solid composition. After washing with hot toluene followed by hot n heptane, the solids were vacuum dried at 90 C for 30 minutes. There were recovered 1.0g of molybdenum carbon hydrogen composition identical in appearance to that obtained in Example 3 which was obtained by a slightly different procedure .Example 7 Gas oil desulfurization with unsupported catalyst of Example.6 Run 46 R 48 . Example 7 is not an example of the catalyst of the invention. The high surface area molybdenum carbonhydrogen composition from Example 6 was charged to a 300 cc autoclave along with 92.27g of fresh, light Arab vacuum gas oil. A gas charge comprising 100 psig H2S and 1950 psig H2 was added at room temperature, and the autoclave was then heated to 385 C for a 30 minute stirred contact followed by 40 minutes at 449 C. Upon cooling below 93.33 C, the autoclave gases were vented off, measured, and collected for analysis of composition by mass spectrometry. The autoclave contents were filtered to recover an unsupported catalyst comprising molybdenum, carbon and hydrogen and a product oil. The product oil was found to contain 0.38 weight percent sulfur. Overall, the desulfurization of the oil feed amounted to 84 weight percent.Example 8 Preparation of supported molybdenum carbonhydrogen containing composition from a mixture of preformed molybdenum carbon hydrogen composition and 410 stainless steel powder Run 56 R 49 . A mixture consisting of 0.8g of unsupported high surface area molybdenum carbon hydrogen composition recovered from Example 7, 50.0g of 325 mesh Tyler 410 stainless steel powder and 93.57g of light Arab vacuum gas oil was charged to a 300 cc autoclave. A gas charge comprising 100 psig H2S and 1950 psig H2 was added at room temperature and the autoclave was then heated to 385 C for a 30 minute stirred contact followed by a contact of 40 minutes at 449 C. Upon cooling below 93.33 C, the autoclave gases were vented off, measured, and collected for analysis of composition by mass spectrometry. The contents of the autoclave were filtered to recover the molybdenum containing catalyst and a product oil. After washing sequentially with hot toluene and hot n heptane, the solids were vacuum dried at 90 C for 30 minutes.There were recovered 53.82g of catalyst solids which were 1 identical in appearance to the molybdenum carbon hydrogen coated catalysts of Examples 1, 2 and 4 2 free of any of the characteristically fluffy unsupported molybdenum carbonhydrogen composition and 3 ferromagnetic, i.e., all of the solids were attracted by a magnet. The sulfur in the oil product, 0.34 weight percent, was somewhat lower than that seen in Example 7. This shows that the hydrodesulfurization activity of the catalyst. was not lost by preparing it by combining the molybdenumcarbon hydrogen composition with the 410 stainless steel powder. The supported catalyst resulting fromExample 8 is a catalyst in accordance with the present invention.Example 9 Gas Oil Desulfurization with the supported catalyst of Example 8 Run 56 R 52 . The gas oil desulfurization test used inExample 7 was repeated using the catalyst of the present invention recovered from Example 8. The sulfur in the oil product was 0.38 weight percent, which is identical to that obtained with the unsupported catalyst comprising molybdenum carbon hydrogen of Example 7. The results show that the molybdenum carbon hydrogen composition continues to exhibit its full activity after being supported on 410 stainless steel powder. Tables I to III summarize some of the data of the above given examples.

Hastelloy C is a trademark of Haynes Stellite Co., Kohomo, Ind. see ChemicalEngineering Handbook, McGraw Hill, 1934 edited by Perry .The stainless steel was ferromagnetic. Particle size distribution of the 410 stainless steel was 99.9 less than 30 microns, 96.7 less than 20 microns and 54.2 less than 10 microns. The reactor was flushed with hydrogen after charging and then pressured to 25 psig with hydrogen sulfide and then to 2000 psig with hydrogen.The reactor temperature was increased to 300 C with stirring and held there for 120 minutes. Thereafter, the reactor was cooled quickly and the contents discharged. The stainless steel on which the metal sulfide containing composition was deposited was recovered by filtration, washed free of adhering oil with toluene and vacuum dried at 80 C to constant weight. In this manner, 51.94 grams of catalyst which was still strongly ferromagnetic were recovered. This recovered catalyst gave the following analyses molybdenum, 0.39 weight percent carbon, 0.41 weight percent hydrogen, 0.07 weight percent. Analysis of the oil medium showed a molybdenum concentration of 1 ppm, thus further demonstrating that the molybdenum was associated with the 410 stainless steel particles. The conversion advantages obtained using theMoS2 carbon hydrogen deposited on 410 stainless steel as catalyst in the hydrocracking of Cold Lake Crude, relative to 410 stainless steel alone and to a non catalytic system are shown in Table IV.

It should be noted that run 6R 34 is a comparative run with n6 catalyst and run 21 R 08 is a comparative run with stainless steel alone. Run 21 R 05 catalyst of example 10, molybdenum sulfide carbonhydrogen on stainless steel is a run utilizing the catalyst of the present invention. It should be noted that molybdenum sulfide carbon hydrogen deposited on stainless steel as catalyst was better than the run utilizing the stainless steel alone as catalyst, particularly for suppresing the formation of coke.Example 11 The conversion advantages obtained using molybdenum sulfide carbon hydrogen surface coated 410 stainless steel Example 10 as catalyst in the hydrocracking of light Arabian vacuum gas oil, relative to 410 stainless steel alone are shown in Table V.

This is a desirable selectivity characteristic for most vacuum gas oil hydrocracking uses.Example 12 A catalyst comprising a molybdenum sulfidecarbon hydrogen composition coated on a 325 mesh Tyler water atomized ferroaluminum alloy powder was prepared as follows a mixture comprising 3.68 grams of molybdenum naphthenate, 99.8 grams of light Arab vacuum gas oil and 50 grams of alloy powder which assigned 90.5 weight percent Fe 9.1 weight percent C1 and 0.4 weight percent oxygen was charged to a 300 cc autoclave, which was pressured with 20 psig hydrogen sulfide and 2000 psig hydrogen at room temperature and then heated with stirring for a period of two hours at 399 C 750 F . The autoclave was cooled below 93.33 C 200 F and vented while further cooling to room temperature. The autoclave contents were filtered and the recovered solids were washed with hot toluene followed by hot n heptane.After vacuum oven drying for one hour at 90 C, 52.08 grams of catalyst were recovered. The recovered catalyst is a catalyst of the present invention. The resistance of the catalyst of example 12 to sulfiding corrosion was determined by subjecting the catalyst to four consecutive high severity cycles of vacuum gas oil hydrocracking. After the fourth cycle, fifty two point twenty eight 52.28g grams of dry catalyst were recovered, which amount is only O.g greater in weight than the weight of the catalyst charged to the first hydrocracking cycle. The apparent rate of weight increase percent increase in weight divided by hours of contact was 0.16 per hour. A summary of the hydrocracking results obtained in each cycle is given in Table VI.
