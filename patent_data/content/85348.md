# Reagents for the determination of enzymes.

## Abstract
Assay reagents for the determination of enzymes such as α amylase, α glucosidase, β glucosidase, and acid and alkaline phosphatases are described. The reagents comprise a substrate capable of releasing the chromophore p nitrophenol at a rate proportional to the amount of enzyme being essayed and a buffer material that eliminates the temperature dependence of the chromophore.
