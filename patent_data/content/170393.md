# Data recording medium.

## Abstract
A data recording medium comprising, as a recording layer, a thin magnetic alloy film 2 having an axis of easy magnetization along a direction perpendicular to the surface thereof, and an anticorrosion protective layer 3 formed on the recording layer 2 . This recording medium is featured in that the anticorrosion protective layer 3 is formed of a thin oxide film which is obtained by subjecting the surface portion of the recording layer 2 to an anodic oxidization. This protective layer 2 may be further covered with a dielectric film as a second protective covering.
