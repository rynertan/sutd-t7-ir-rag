## Description
The invention relates to a method of detrmining an NMR distribution in a region of a body which is situated in a steady, uniform magnetic field, including the steps of The invention also relates to a device for determining an NMR distribution in a region of a body, comprising Such a method and device are known from FR A 2533031 Netherlands Patent Application 82.03519 . During the measurement period in the known method a periodic, alternating gradient magnetic field is generated whose period equals the sampling interval, at least one additional signal sample being taken in each sampling interval. As explained in said FR A 2533031, the use of the alternating gradient magnetic field and the taking of additional signal samples ensure that at least two rows of a two dimensional image frequency matrix will have been filled after the sampling of a resonance signal FID or spin echo signal . Thus, the duration of a measurement cycle is reduced to one half one third, one quarter when one two, three additional signal samples are taken, respectively. Because the duration of a resonance signal amounts to only some tens of milliseconds, the taking of 128 or 256 signal samples in a row in the image frequency matrix will require a sampling interval of the order of magnitude of 100 µs, which means that the frequency of the additional gradient magnetic field must amount to 10 kHz. This comparatively high frequency for the alternating gradient magnetic field limits the maximum number of rows of the image frequency matrix which can be filled by sampling a single resonance signal. The maximum distance Δk between two rows filled by sampling a resonance signal amounts to in which ½t It is also to be noted that the energy required for operating the gradient coils increases with the frequency of the magnetic field when the energy to be applied to the gradient coils is increased, the eddy currents in the metal parts of the magnet for generating the main field also increase, which is undesirable. The first effect means that comparatively expensive amplifier equipment will be required, which is also a drawback. In the British Patent Application GB 2 026 172 there is described a multiple line volume NMR method. Multiple line volumes are scanned using spin echo excitation for non overlapping line volumes. E.g. in Figure 5 of GB 2 026 172 in two line volumes there are generated spin echo resonance signals. Although a magnetic field gradient g It is an object of the invention to provide a method and a device in which it is not necessary to generate an alternating, periodic gradient magnetic field having a comparatively high frequency, and in which the period of time required for making an image having a resolution which at least equals that obtained when use is made of the prior art method and device is the same or substantially shorter. It is a further object of the invention to provide a method and a device such that defects in an image of the nuclear magnetization distribution which are caused by non uniformities of the uniform magnetic field, local susceptibility transitions and chemical shift σ of the resonance frequency of bound nuclei are eliminated or substantially reduced. To achieve this, a method in accordance with the invention is characterized in that the period of the sampling interval is at least a factor 2 shorter than the period of the alternating periodic gradient magnetic field which at most equals the measurement period, as a result of which k space is being filled according to a zig zag pattern during a measurement period T can reach such a high value that the maximum image frequency for example, k A preferred version of a method in accordance with the invention in which a steady, uniform magnetic field is generated in which the region of the body is situated and which includes the steps of The preferred version of the method in accordance with the invention offers the advantage that all signal samples associated with the image frequencies k It will be known that the precessional frequency of the nuclear magnetization M is often defined by means of the formula ω γ.B, in which γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and B is the intensity of the magnetic field. The gyromagnetic ratio γ depends on the type of nucleus only if the nucleus is considered to be free. Usually nuclei are not considered to be free, because they are affected by binding electrons about the nucleus. This becomes apparent as the so called chemical shift the bound nucleus does not resonate at ω γ.B, but rather at ω γ.B. 1 σ . Both the angular frequency ω and the shift Δω ω ω γ .B. σ are proportional to the magnetic field B. The value of σ is generally very small having an order of magnitude of 10 ⁶ . If the intensity of the magnetic field B is sufficiently high for example, 1.5 T this chemical shift σ can cause defects in an image of the proton density in a body. The shift Δω for protons in fat with respect to protons in water amounts to 200 Hz for a field strength of 1.5 T σ 3.5.10 ⁶ . The appearance of image defects due to the chemical shift σ will now be described. An image of a body is composed of a matrix of pixels. When a row of pixels is considered which extends in the gradient direction of a gradient magnetic field, a bandwidth Δω Non uniformities of the steady field may also cause image defects which are really distortions of the image of the actual situations. Furthermore, susceptibility differences also cause deformations of the actual image. Said differences may locally reach very high values up to 9 ppm, compare σ 3.5 ppm . When an applied gradient magnetic field is not much stronger than a local gradient due to non uniformity and susceptibility differences, pronounced image distortion will occur which causes one part of the image to be shifted over another part. The local intensities are also affected because in the distorted shifted part the image intensity is retained and actually superposed on the intensity of another part of the image . This causes intensity increases and decreases at contours of organs in medical images which could be incorrectly interpreted layers of fat concentrations where there are no concentrations . The effect of said non uniformities and susceptibility differences can be partly eliminated by choosing a very strong gradient magnetic field. However, this solution has the drawback that the bandwidth of the nuclear spin resonance signal to be received becomes very wide, which results in a poor signal to noise ratio. In order to obtain an image of an NMR distribution without the defects caused by chemical shift, non uniformities of the steady main magnetic field and local susceptibility differences, a version of the method in accordance with the invention is characterized in that during the measurement period only the alternating gradient magnetic field is applied so that, after the signal transformation has been applied to the signal samples taken, there is obtained for each pixel a frequency spectrum in which the intensities of the nuclear spins, whether bound or not, can be distinguished, after which an image of a magnetization distribution of a given type of nuclear spin is formed by selecting for each pixel the intensity of a selected type of nuclear spin from the frequency spectrum associated with the relevant pixel. An image of an NMR distribution thus obtained is substantially free of the described defects, which can be understood as follows. The chemical shift causes intensity peaks in the frequency spectrum which are always situated at the same distance from one another so that they can be recognized. Magnetic field non uniformities and local susceptibility differences cause a local field strength variation and hence a frequency shift of said intensity peaks in the frequency spectrum. When a sufficiently wide frequency spectrum is measured for each pixel and the recognizable intensity peaks are selected from this spectrum, the frequency shifts are cancelled. For example, for the determination of a proton density distribution it is now possible to form a distortion free image of a distribution of free protons water , bound protons fat and the total protons water fat by adding in the latter case the intensity peaks of water and of fat from the frequency spectrum for each pixel. A device in accordance with the invention is characterized in that the programmed computer means are further arranged to establish that the period of the sampling interval is at least a factor 2 shorter than the period of the alternating periodic gradient magnetic field which at most equals the measurement period, as a result of which k space is being filled according to a zig zag pattern during a measurement period, the zig zag patterns being shifted and interleaved in k space with respect to each other over different repetitions. Embodiments in accordance with the invention will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to the drawing therein Fig. 1 shows a coil system 10 which forms part of a device The coil system The coil system 10 also comprises four rectangular coils 5 only two of which are shown or four other coils such as, for example Golay coils , for generating the gradient magnetic field G Fig. 2 shows a device The described device During a next step signal samples are collected. For this purpose use can be made of the gradient fields which are generated by the generators 19, 21, 23, respectively under the control of the central control means 45. The detection of the resonance signal referred to as an FID signal is performed by switching on the r.f. detector 27, the demodulator 28, the sampling circuit 29, the analog to digital converter 31, and the control unit 37. This FID signal appears as a result of the precessional motion of the nuclear magnetizations about the field direction of the magnetic field Bo due to the r.f. excitation pulse. This nuclear magnetization induces an induction voltage in the detection coil whose amplitude is a measure of the nuclear magnetization. The analog sampled FID signals originating from the sampling circuit 29 are digitized converter 31 and stored in a memory 33. After a final signal sample has been taken during a measurement cycle, the central control means 45 deactivates the generators 19, 21 and 23, the sampling circuit 21, the control unit 37 and the analog to digital converter 31. The sampled FID signal is and remains stored in the memory 33. Subsequently, a next measurement cycle is performed during which an FID signal is generated, sampled and stored in the memory 33. When a sufficient number of FID signals have been measured the number of FID signals to be measured depends, for example on the desired resolution , a 2 D or 3 D image of a nuclear magnetization distribution can be determined Fig. 3a shows an example of a measurement cycle in accordance with the invention which will be described with reference to the device 15 shown in Fig. 2. After switching on the main coils 1 which generate a steady, uniform magnetic field Bo, a 90 It is known that the phase angle of a magnetization at a point Thus, an image frequency k Thus, after each sampling period t It will be apparent that when a gradient field G Because a periodic, alternating gradient magnetic field G As a result, the first signal sample which is taken during the measurement period T In order to fill the image frequency matrix k Consequently, after the application of the G and similarly By choosing a different value for k Various alternatives exist for the described sampling diagram filling diagram for the k Figs. 4a and 4b show the principle of a preferred version of a method in accordance with the invention. Using a 90 so that the image frequency matrix can always be filled starting from the same side k When a shorter delay period τ Because t It will be apparent that it is possible to start a new measurement cycle with a 180 Fig. 5a shows examples of G For the selection adjustment of a given measurement cycle with associated time intervals and respective periodic and alternating gradient field intensities, use is made of programmed computer means. In an embodiment of the device 15 Fig. 2 , the central control means 45 comprise a programmed computer 51 VAX 11 730 including an input output station 52 and an interface 53 see Fig. 6 , the outputs 55 thereof controlling the following sections of the device 15 the generators 19, 21 and 23 for the gradient field waveforms to be generated, the generator 25 for generating r.f. 90 A further version of a method in accordance with the invention will be described with reference to Fig. 7. According to the hereinbefore described methods, all image frequencies between k When an image is to be reconstructed from the measurement data in the image frequency matrix k When the signal samples are taken using methods in which the k It has already been mentioned that during the regular uniform filling of the k Another step would be to adapt the shape of the amplitude of the alternating gradient field. An example of such an amplitude is shown in Fig. 9a. Each half period of the alternating gradient field terminates with a back porch with the amplitude equal to zero. The duration of this back porch is preferably equal to half the sampling interval which may in this case be twice as long as the sampling interval used for a method as described with reference to Figs. 3a, b and 4a, b. Half the duration of the period of the alternating gradient field preferably amounts to m ½ or Although the foregoing examples may have created the impression that the invention relates only to the determination of a nuclear spin density distribution, the invention can also be used advantageously for the determination of a T₁ relaxation time distribution, a T₂ relaxation time distribution, and a flow velocity distribution, and for location dependent spectroscopy. In the latter case, for example no constant gradient field will be present during the measurement period see Figs. 3a and 4a but only the image frequency k It is also to be noted that the description of spectroscopy measurements in accordance with the described methods can be used to determine nuclear spin density distributions in which image defects due to chemical shift σ and magnetic field non uniformities which are caused by a non ideal steady main field Bo see Figs. 1 and 2 and by local susceptibility differences, are virtually absent. The foregoing will be described in detail with reference to Figures 3a and b. The measurement cycles for filling the entire k It is also possible to carry out measurements without switching on the G
