# PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF DIFFERENTLY DESIGNED CERAMIC PAVING TILES AND TILE OBTAINED THEREBY

## Abstract
Process for the production of differently designated ceramic tiles, comprising the step of showering appropriate ly selected vitreous bodies over the entire surface of the tiles, after having previously applied thereon an ordinary priming layer of spreaded enamel and a pattern of special enamel, and the step of directing a blow of skimming air to remove from the tiles the vitreous bodies arranged on the areas of said tiles whereon said special enamel has not been applied, the remaining previous and following steps of the process being those typical of the conventional processes for the production of enamelled ceramic tiles.
