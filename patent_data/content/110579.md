## Abstract
A polar relay comprises a contact spring assembly, a permanent magnet assembly, a winding assembly and an arma ture assembly which are arranged on a frame body assembly made of an insulating material. All the assemblies are positioned adjacent to and parallel to each other and are fit in the base during assembly. When mounted on a printed circuit board, the polar relay requires a minimum of area and enhances productivity.
