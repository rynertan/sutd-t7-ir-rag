# Complementary MOS circuit.

## Abstract
The substrate voltages V₁ and V₂ of NMOS and PMOS transistors, respectively, which constitute a CMOS circuit and the source voltages V₃ and V₄ of these transistors have the following relationship V₁ V₃ V₄ V₂ where V₁ may be equal to V₃ or V₄ may be equal to V₂ . In order to maintain the above relationship, it is prefer able that internal power supply means are formed on the substrate upon which is also formed the CMOS circuit so that some of the above voltages may be produced.
