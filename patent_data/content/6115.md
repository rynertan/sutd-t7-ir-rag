# Apparatus and method for continuous tread production.

## Abstract
An apparatus and processes for the production of a continuous rubber strip which is molded with surface designs, such as tire treads, in the uncured state and then cured, after removal from the mold, by heat or radiation is disclosed. In the apparatus the extruded rubber strip 2 is passed between cooperating mold segments carried by respective endless belts 3, 4 which, along with related components, apply suitable temperatures and pressures to the strip to produce the surface designs. The molded uncured rubber strip is removed from the molds and then completely cured by radiation und or heat. Process embodiments are also disclosed wherein partial curing of the rubber while in the molding apparatus is performed.
