# ULTRASONIC VIBRATORY ATOMIZER

## Abstract
An ultrasonic atomizer has the nozzle body horn formed with the vibrational node in the region of an annular mountig flange about the largest diameter of the nozzle body. The fluid inlet and bypass passages for the nozzle body are located in the mounting flange and a resilient seal ring is provided on each opposite side of the mounting flange. The seal rings are in radial compression between the nozzle body and the housing for providing the dual function of vibrational mounting equally about the nodal region and fluid pressure sealing about the inlet and bypass ports.
