# Process for melt spinning acrylonitrile polymer hydrates.

## Abstract
The melt spinning of acrylonitrile polymer hydrates is improved when the polymer used contains at least 91 by weight acrylonitrile units and up to 9 by weight of one or more copolymeric units and has an intrinsic viscosity of 0.6 2, 7 23 µ eq. g. enolizable groups after mild acid treatment, 15 70 µ eq. g thioether ends derived from a water insoluble mercaptan and less than 3 µ eq. g. oxidizable hydrolysis fragments.
