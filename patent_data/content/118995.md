# Generation of identification keys.

## Abstract
Commercial transactions conducted over a telecom munications link are verified using a transaction key avail able at both ends of the link. The transaction key is produced by combining 1 data supplied to the retailer by a customer and stored by the bank with 2 data stored by the retailer. The telecommunications link includes a node which passes the retailer s data to the bank in the form of a label obtained by encrypting the retailer s code with a client code. The bank retrieves the bank code and decrypts the label to obtain the retailer s code. The bank also retrieves the customer s data and combines the two elements to obtain the same transac tion key that was created at the retailer s terminal.
