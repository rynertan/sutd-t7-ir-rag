## Description
THIN FILM MAGNETIC HEAD ANDMANUFACTURING METHOD THEREOF The present invention relates to a thin film magnetic head suitable to apparatus including video tape recorders. In recent years, metal tapes have been widely used as magnetic tapes for video tape recorders. As a magnetic head suitable to such a metal tape, a thin film magnetic head has been proposed by one of the present inventors as disclosed in the Japanese Utility Model ApplicationLaid Open No. 141419 83, for example. In such a thin film magnetic head, a magnetic thin film made of sendust, permalloy or the like having a high saturation magnetic flux density is used as the core material. And as shown in Fig. 1, the first magnetic core 2 and the second magnetic core 3 respectively made of magnetic thin films are formed on a non magnetic substrate 1. A gap 5 formed on the non magnetic substrate 1 is put between the first and second magnetic cores 2 and 3 and is made of a nonmagnetic material.A winding hole 6, i.e., a hole used for passing windings therethrough is provided in the magnetic cores 2 and 3, the gap 5, and the substrate 1 as shown in Fig. 1. Windings 7 are wound through the hole 6 to form the thin film magnetic head. Since the winding hole 6 regulates the gap depth Gd of the thin film magnetic head 10 in this structure, however, the gap depth Gd depends upon the work precision of the winding hole. Accordingly, it is very diffuclt to attain the gap depth with high precision. From the restriction of the machine tool, the winding hole 6 is generally round shaped or oval. From the viewpoint of the head performance and efficiency, it is desired that the above described shape and an acuteangled front end in the direction of the front surface of the head. However, it is difficult to meet the desire by machining. After work, the positioning precision of the winding hole 6 and the face precision contrary to the face roughness of the hole edge line and the internal surface of the hole are poor. It is extremely difficult to attain the demanded precision 5 vm for the gap depthGd. Because glass or ceramics material having high resistance to wear is generally used as the non magnetic substrate 1 and such a material is not easily shaved in many cases. Further, since the winding hole 6 is provided close to the front surface or the tape abrasion surface of the head, the strength of the portion of the gap depthGd poses a problem. In addition, due to vibration or head generated during work, the magnetic thin film might peel off or its characteristics might be deteriorated. Since the portion of the gap depth Gd along the gap is important in the head performance, the above described problems might bring about fatal results. If the winding hole is formed at the original substrate stage, the degree of freedom in the work method is increased. However, the gap might be short c r c due to the magnetic thin film adhered to the internal surface of the hole, resulting in trouble to the head performance. An object of the present invention is to provide a magnetic head having a gap structure defined correctly with high dimension precision. Another object of the invention is to provide a thin film magnetic head having a well defined magnetic path region. Another object of the invention is to provide an integrated magnetic head having a gap of accurate threedimensional structure formed on one non magnetic substrate.To attain the above described objects, in accordance with the present invention, means for regulating the gap depth is provided and the gap depth structure is separated from the winding structure. That is to say, in a portion which is surrounded by magnetic cores magnetic circuit formed on a non magnetic substrate and which adjoins the gap depth surface side, a non magnetic pattern material is provided. And the non magnetic pattern material functions to regulate the gap depth and prevents the magnetic core magnetic thin film from peeling off or being deteriorated in characteristics. Since a non magnetic pattern material adjoining a magnetic core is provided on at least the gap depth surface side of a region which is surrounded by the magnetic cores magnetic circuit on a non magnetic substrate, it is possible to realize the dimension of the gap depth with extremely high precision and it is also possible to prevent the film peeling off and characteristics deterioration in the head manufacturing process. The present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is an oblique view of a thin film magnetic head of the prior art Fig. 2 is an oblique view of an embodiment of a thin film magnetic head according to the present invention Figs. 3a to 3e are drawings for illustrating the manufacturing process of the thin film magnetic head illustrated in Fig. 2 Fig. 4 is an oblique view of an improvement over the thin film magnetic head illustrated in Fig. 2 Figs.Sa and 5b are plane views of other examples of non magnetic patttern materials Fig. 6 is an oblique view of the above described thin film magnetic head when it is attached to the base Fig. 7 is an oblique view of another embodiment of a thin film magnetic head according to the present invention Fig. 8 is an oblique view of still another embodiment of a thin film magnetic head according to the present invention Figs. 9a to 9f show the manufacturing process of the thin film mangetic head illustrated in Fig. 8 and Fig. 10 is an oblique view of application of the thin film magnetic head illustrated in Fig. 8. An embodiment of a thin film magnetic head according to the present invention will now be described by referring to Fig. 2. The thin film magnetic head ofFig. 2 includes a non magnetic substrate 1, magnetic cores 2 and 3, a gap material 5, a winding hole 6, windings 7 and a non magnetic pattern material 8. The non magnetic substrate 1 is made of crystallized glass or a nonmagnetic ceramics material which has high resistance to wear. The non magnetic substrate 1 is approximately 2 mm square and is 0.1 to 0.3 mm in thickness. The suitable coefficient of thermal expansion of the non magnetic substrate is approximately 100 x 10 7to 130 x 7 10 . The magnetic cores 2 and 3 are made of multi layer films of an amorphous alloy which is mainly composed ofCo. Each layer is 5 to 10 pmin thickness and is insulated from adjacent layers by SiO2 films having thickness of approximately 0.1 m in order to avoid the eddy current loss in the video frequency band. For the magnetic cores 2 and 3, a sendust alloy may be used instead of an amorphous alloy. A pair of magnetic cores 2 ald 3 respectively taking the shape of letters C and I form a magnetic circuit in conjunction with the gap material put between them. The thickness of the magnetic core is chosen to be nearly equal to the track width 10 to 30 pm. However, the thickness of the portions excepting the gap located on the head front surface side may be increased or decreased. The gap material 5 is a non magnetic film made of SiO2, for example, and is 0.2 to 0.3 um in thickness. The direction of the gap face is inclined by a predetermined azimuth angle 100 in the perferred embodiment with respect to the normal direction to non magnetic substrate 1. The gap material 5 is formed over the entire length in the depth direction of the heat. Instead, the gap matërial 5 mÅay be forZried o ly near the front surface of the magnetic cores 2 and 3 The gap material 5 may also be adhered to the upper faces or the lower faces of the magnetic cores 2 and 3.The pattern materials 8 and 8a are non magnetic metal materials such as aluminum. Instead, the non magnetic pattern materials 8 and 8a may be glass or ceramics material which is identical or similar to the above described non magnetic substrate 1 or may be heatresisting organic resin polyimide . On the non magnetic substrate 1, the non magnetic pattern materials 8 and 8a are formed on the place where the magnetic cores 2 and 3 are not present. The non magnetic pattern materials 8 and 8a are nearly equal to the magnetic cores 2 and 3 in thichness and are in contact with the magnetic cores 2 and 3 intervened by a plane further via the gap material 5 in some places . The non magnetic pattern material 8 is formed in the place surrounded by the magnetic cores 2 and 3 and may be trapezoidal shown in Fig. 2.Two boundary planes of the trapezoid near the front surface 13 make an acute angle. The angle a is more preferably approximately 400 to 700. On the other hand, the nonmagnetic pattern material 8a is formed on the periphery surrounding the magnetic cores 2 and 3. The non magnetic pattern material 8a may be omitted. Within the boundaries of the above described non magnetic pattern material 8, the winding hole 6 is so provided as to pass through the non magentic substrate 1. The windings 7 are wound through the winding hole 6 to form the thin film magnetic head 10. Although not illustrated in Fig. 2, a non magnetic metal material chrome, zirconium, or the like of approximately 1 to 5 pm is formed between the nonmagnetic substrate 1 and the magnetic cores 2 and 3.The similar non magnetic metal material is also formed over the upper surfaces of the magnetic cores 2 and 3 partly or wholley to improve the precision of the track width. On the upper surfaces of the magnetic cores 2 and 3 and the pattern materials 8 and 8a, a guard film is formed. The guard film is 30 to 50 pm in thickness and is made of alumina, forsterite, or the like which has high resistance to wear and which is close to the material of the magnetic core in coefficient of thermal expansion. In such a thin film magnetic head 10, the shape of the head magnetic circuit, especially the value of gap depth Gd is uniquely defined by the boundary between the magnetic core 2 and the non magnetic pattern material 8, and has no connection with the position or face precision of the winding hole 6. That is to say, if the non magnetic pattern material 8 is formed with high precision, the gap depth can be automatically realized with high precision. In addition, since the surfaces of the winding hole 6 is not in direct contact with the magnetic cores 2 and 3, the magnetic path is defined by the boundary surface of the pattern material 8 and it is possible to prevent peeling off or magnetic characteristics deterioration during the manufacturing process. Figs. 3a to 3e show the manufacturing process of the thin film magnetic head illustrated in Fig. 2. The steps of the manufacturing process will now be sequentially described. In the step of Fig. 3a, the non magnetic pattern materials 8 and 8a modeling the head magnetic circuit in the negative form are formed on the nonmagnetic substrate I which is approximately 1 mm in th ick ness. The thickness of the non magnetic pattern materials 8 and 8a is chosen to be close to that 10 to 30 pm of the magnetic core including the non magnetic materials placed above and below the magnetic core, if present .Especially for the portion 8 of the non magnetic pattern materialr which is surrounded by the magnetic circuit, severe dimension precision is demanded. When aluminum is used as the non magnetic pattern material, for example, the following method 1 or 2 is taken. In the method 1 , after aluminum is coated by vaporization on the entire surface of the non magnetic substrate 1, a mask made of another heat resisting resin is placed on the surface and aluminum is removed by ion etching from above. In the method 2 , another heat resisting resin is formed into a predetermined high precision concave pattern by plasma etching, and aluminum is coated by vaporization and buried into the concave groove, and the resin is removed after aluminum is leveled.As a result, the non magnetic pattern material 8 is obtained with the position precision of 2 to 3 pm, the face roughness 1 to 2 pm of the section, and taper angle, or the angle of the environmental boundary plane measured from the core plane, of 700 to 900. In the step of Fig. 3b, a non magnetic film not illustrated , a magnetic core 2 , and the second non magnetic film not illustrated are successively formed on the concave portion resulting from the step ofFig. 3a. The magnetic core 2 is formed in a thin film by sputtering an amorphous alloy Co family or a sendust alloy. For avoiding loss in the high frequency region, the magnetic core 2 is insulated every 5 to 10 pm by aSiO2 film which is 0.1 pm in thickness. And the magnetic core 2 is 10 to 30 pm in total thickness. The SiO2 films are also formed by sputtering. The non magnetic films are formed by vapor coating or sputtering chrome, zirconium, or the like. The upper surfaces of the nonmagnetic pattern materials 8 and 8a are flattened or leveled by abrasion. In the step of Fig. 3c, a half of the buried magnetic core 2 is removed along the projected gap and its extension to form a gap face 4. In Fig. 3c, a half which does not include the non magnetic pattern material 8 is removed until the gap face 4 appears at the central part between the non magnetic pattern materials 8 and 8a. For this removal, a shaving by a diamond tool is effective. Thereby, it becomes possible to obtain a gap face having good linearity and tapered with a predetermined azimuth angle 00 to 100 with respect to the substrate surface. The diamond tool has passed through a portion 8b. Since the magnetic core on the gap face is held by the non magnetic pattern materials 8 and 8a in front and in the rear, the film peeling off due to work process can be prevented.For reducing the work hours, the width of the material to be shaved and removed can be reduced to several ten pm in the actual process by providing the magnetic core 2 so as to slightly exceed the projected gap face using the mask sputtering or etching in the step of Fig. 3b, instead of providing the magnetic core 2 on the entire concave surface. The magnetic core 2 taking the shape of letterC is thus obtained. In the step of Fig. 3d, the gap material 5 made of SiO2 or the like is formed on the gap face 4 by sputtering. The gap material is 0.2 to 0.3 pm in thickness. If mask sputtering is used at this time, it is possible to confine the gap material 5 to a necessary portion of the front part the surface abraded by the magnetic tape of the gap face 4. Subsequently, the second magnetic core 3 is adhered and buried in the concave half wherefrom the magnetic core has been removed in the step of Fig. 3c. Although the magnetic core 3 is produced in the same way as the above described magnetic core 2, it is made slightly larger in thickness than the magnetic core 2. The unnecessary film adhered onto the magnetic core 2 is removed by abrasion until the non magnetic pattern materials 8 and 8a are exposed.The magnetic core 3 taking the shape of letter I is thus obtained. If, at this time, a non magnetic film is provided on the upper surface of the C shaped magnetic core 2 and the above described abrasion is terminated within the thickness of the non magnetic film, the track width is uniquely defined by the thickness of theC shaped magnetic core 2, resulting in high precision.In the above described abrasion, the entire surface of the magnetic core need not necessarily be leveled, but only the portions on the head front part and on the nonmagnetic pattern material 8 may be leveled. Thereafter, a guard film not illustrated made of alumina, forsterite, or the like is coated by vaporization by 30 to 50 pm for guarding the magnetic cores 2 and 3. In the step of Fig. 3f, the winding hole 6 is opened inside the boundary planes of the non magnetic pattern material 8 by ultrasonic machining. The hole is 0.2 to 0.3 mm in diameter and is round shaped or oval. The hole is 0.3 mm or more in depth and reaches the non magnetic substrate 1. Then the thickness of the nonmagnetic substrate 1 is so reduced to 0.1 to 0.3 mm by applying a slicer to its rear face as to pass through the winding hole 6. Then the side of the front surface 13 is subjected to cylinderical abrasion to attain the predetermined gap depth Gd 20 to 30 pm. The cylindrical abrasion can be effected while watching that the front face side of the non magnetic pattern material 8a is removed and the tape rubbing face side of the magnetic core 2 is exposed. Or alternatively, the cylindrical grinding or cylindrical abrasion can be effected while observing on the measuring instrument the change in the inductance value of the winding 7 which is caused by the abrasion of the front surface of the magnetic core 3.When the latter method is adopted, the winding 7 must be wound before the abrasion step. Owing to the function of the non magnetic patternmaterial 8, the edge line of the magnetic core 2 becomes clear with high precision.The precision iS pm of the gap depth Gd can be easily attained. Further, since the non magnetle pattern material 8 guards the magnetic core from the heat or vibration generated during the ultrasonic machining, the film peeling off and the characteristics deterioration can be prevented. If the cylindrical abrasion was effected by watching the removal, the winding 7 is then wound to realize the thin film magnetic head 10 as illustrated in Fig. 1. In a modified manufacturing method, an nonmagnetic substrate with the winding hole 6 perforated thereon beforehand is used. As described before, the gap shortcircuit may be brought about in the prior art.By using the non magnetic pattern material 8 according to the present invention, however, the trouble of the gap shortcircuit is obviated and the gap depth can be realized with high precision. The case of one thin film magnetic head has heretofore been described. If a substrate having a large area is used, however, a number of thin film magnetic heads can be produced in the surface at a time, resulting in improved mass productivity. In that case, a step for separating the substrate into thin film magnetic heads is required. By separating the substrate at a portion of the non magnetic pattern material 8a serving as the boundary, the peeling off and the characteristics deterioration of the magnetic core can be prevented. Fig. 4 shows an improvement over the thin film magnetic head illustrated in Fig. 2. The thin film magnetic head of Fig. 4 is characterized by the detailed shape of the non magnetic pattern material. That is to say, the edge line 12 of the front part of the nonmagnetic pattern material 8 for defining the gap depth Gd is made nearly parallel to the front face 13.The desirable length of the edge line 12 is approximately several ten pm. The length exceeding 100 pm worsens the head efficiency. Even if a slight error of the gap position is caused in the above described gap face forming step, the value of the gap depth Gd exhibits no change provided that the shape of Fig. 4 is adopted and that the gap position is within the length of the edge line 12. As a result, high precision can be maintained. Such an embodiment can we applied to other embodiments described later. Although the non magnetic pattern material 8 is trapezoidal in the embodiment of Fig. 4, it is permitted to use any shape having two boundaries Q1 and Q2 which is near the front face and which make an acute angle.For example, the shape illustrated in Fig. 5 may be used. Fig. 6 shows an example of the above described thin film magnetic head according to the present invention, which is attached to a base 14. The selected attaching face is the upper face of the thin film magnetic head 10 whereon the magnetic core is formed. The first merit in this case is that the gap depth value can be easily read since the shape of the magnetic core can be directly looked at. And the second merit is that the step difference between the base reference face lower face side in Fig. 6 and the track position can be easily realized with precision. Fig. 7 shows another embodiment of a thin film magnetic head according to the present invention. In the thin film magnetic head of Fig. 7, a plurality of gaps two gaps in the case of Fig. 7 are included. A thin film. magnetic head 10 of Fig. 7 includes a pair of C shaped magnetic cores 2a and 2b, a pair of gap materials 5a andSb, winding holes 6a and 6b, windings 7a and 7b, and non magnetic pattern materials 8a and 8b. The thin film magnetic head 10 has two gaps 5a and 5b operating independently each other and has a combination of different azimuth angles. This thin film magnetic head 10 is used for a special reproducing function of a video tape recorder.From the viewpoint of the magnetic circuit, the thin film magnetic head 10 has two magnetic circuits which own jointly an I shaped magnetic core 3 at the center. The I shaped magnetic core 3 may be formed independently. In this embodiment as well, the gap depths Gdl and Gd2 can be obtained with high precision by the function of the non magnetic pattern materials Ba and 8b in the same way as the embodiments described before. Further, in this embodiment, the relative shift between two gap depths must be avoided and the gap interval Xg must be realized with high precision. These demands are satisfied owing to the high position precision of the non magnetic pattern materials 8c and 8d according to the present invention. This embodiment is effective not only for the winding system illustrated in Fig. 7 but also for the thin film coil system which will be described later. Fig. 8 shows still another embodiment of a thin film magnetic head according to the present invention.The thin film magnetic head of Fig. 8 is characterized by the fact that the winding hole is abolished and the winding is realized in the thin film coil form. An nonmagnetic substrate 1, an L shaped magnetic core 2, a gap material 5, an I shaped magnetic core 3, a non magnetic pattern material 8, a rear magnetic core 9, and a thin film coil 11 are included in a thin film magnetic head 10. On the non magnetic substrate 1, the L shaped core 2 and the I shaped core 3 confront each other at the head front face side with the gap material 5 put between.Their rear portions are open circuited. The L shaped core 2 and the I shaped core 3 form a front magnetic core.Inside the magnetic cores, the non magnetic pattern material 8 is formed with nearly identical thickness with the front magnetic core. In the same way as the embodiments described before, the gap depth Gd is realized with high precision. The newly provided rear magnetic core 9 bridges between the L shaped magnetic core 2 and the I shaped magnetic core 3 to form a magnetic loop.The thin film coil 11 surrounds portions of the cores jointed by the bridge and takes the shape of spiral having the linkage with the magnetic loop. The thin film coil 11 is disposed above the upper surfaces of the front magnetic core i.e., the L shaped magnetic core 2 and the I shaped magnetic core 3 and those of the nonmagnetic pattern materials 8 and 8a and below the rear magnetic core 9. They are insulated each other bySiO2 films. The pattern material 8a may be omitted.In the same way as the front magnetic cores 2 and 3, the rear magnetic core 9 is composed of a magnetic thin film made of an amorphous alloy, a sendust alloy, or the like.The thin film coil 11 is made of conductive metal such as copper or aluminum and is formed in the spiral shape by one to three turns at respective joint portions of the magnetic cores. For brevity, figures show the case where each leg has one turn. This coil 11 may be provided at either one portion. The winding direction of one joint portion is opposite to that of the other joint portion. They are wound in the so called balance winding so that currents caused by an external magnetic field falling at right angles with the paper cancel each other.Although not illustrated in Fig. 9, a guard film made of alumina, forsterite, or the like is formed over the rear magnetic core 9 and the thin film coil 11. Similarly to the embodiments described before, the gap depth Gd of the thin film magnetic head of this embodiment can be obtained with high precision owing to the effect of the non magnetic pattern material 8.Further, as a new effect obtained by using the thin film coil winding, the cost required for opening of the winding hole and winding work can be signifcantly reduced. As for the performance, the joint area of the rear magnetic core can be made sufficiently large in the magnetic circuit, and the tight winding to the magnetic core becomes possible by the use of the thin film coil. Accordingly, the recording reproducing efficiency of the head can be improved. Since the perforating work of the winding hole has been eliminated, the film deterioration due to work can be completely avoided. Figs. 9a to 9f show the manufacturing process of the thin film magnetic head illustrated in Fig. 8.The steps of the manufacturing process will now be described one after another. In the step of Fig. 9a, the non magnetic pattern materials 8 and 8a modeling the front magnetic core in the negative form are formed on the non magnetic substrate 1. In the step of Fig. 9b, the magnetic core 2 composed of the magnetic thin film is buried into the concave portion of the pattern and is scraped to be flattened In the step of Fig. 9c, a half of the magnetic core 2 is shaved and removed to form the gap face 4 as well as the L shaped magnetic core 2. In the step of Fig. 9d, the gap material 5 is coated and the magnetic core is buried into the remaining half surface and flattened to form the I shaped magnetic core 3. In the step of Fig. 9e, copper, aluminum or the like is coated by vaporization and etched via SiO2 insulating films to form a vortex shaped thin film coil 11. Since at this time the non magnetic pattern material 8 is used, the surface on which the thin film coil 11 is formed is flat. Accordingly, failures such as coil break can be reduced as compared with an uneven surface.Thereafter, the SiO2 insulation film is coated over the upper surface of the thin film coil 11. In the step of Fig. 9f, the rear magnetic core 9 is so formed as to bridge between portions of both legs of the front magnetic core the L shaped magnetic core 2 and the I shaped magnetic core 3 , which are surrounded by the thin film coil 11. At this time, the mask sputtering method i s effective in preventing the core joint portion from exceeding the thin film coil 11. Thereafter, the guard film is adhered and cylindrical abrasion is applied to the front surface 13 to accomplish the thin film magnetic head 10 as illustrated in Fig. 8. Fig. 10 shows still another embodiment of a thin film magnetic head according to the present invention. The thin film magnetic head 10 includes a plurality of gaps two gaps in Fig. 10 and thin film coils lla and llb. Effects similar to those of Figs. 8 and 9 are obtained.
