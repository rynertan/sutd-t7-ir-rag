# MAGNETICALLY SENSITIVE SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE.

## Abstract
A magnetically sensitive semiconductor device for producing a Hall voltage output in the presence of a mag netic field. A carrier, which has been injected from the junction between first and second semiconductor regions, is accelerated by means of an electric field in a depletion layer located at the junction between second and third semiconductor regions. The arrangement is such that, owing to the high speed of the carrier, a higher Hall output voltage can be obtained even for comparatively small elec tric currents.

## Description
SPECIFICATIONTitle of Invention magneto sensitive semiconductor deviceTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a magneto sensitive semiconductor device utilizing theHall effect.BACKGROUND ART In a prior art Hall element, a Hall voltage VH expressed by the following equation is generated.EMI1.1 where I is input current, B is magnetic flux density component perpendicular to the input current, q is carrier charge, n is carrier concentration, and d is the distance where magnetic field acts i.e. the thickness of a semiconductor substrate . This Hall voltage is caused by Lorentz force F acting on the carriers moving in the magnetic field. F q B vxS 2 where E is the electric field which moves the carrier and v is carrier velocity . Being the X axis component of the carrier velocity v and the Z axis component of the magnetic flux density B are taken, electric field Ey along the y axis is generated. By Vx B 3 W being the distance along which By is generated the width of the substrate , the Hall voltageVH is expressed as follows VH E W 4 y since Ix Jx Wd Substituting v and j aE where p is carrier mobility, J is current density, and a is conductivity , tben VH p W Ex Bz 5a EMI2.1 the equation 13 is obtained, substituting a q.p .n in the equation 5b . In order to increase the Hall voltage, magnetic flux density and the width, being equal the electric field and the carrier mobility the carrier mobility increases as the electric field increases but is gradually saturated must increase from equation 5a .With the conventional Hall element, in which the conduction mechanism by the majority carrier has the linear current voltage characteristic, the current increases in proportion to the input voltage in order to increase the electrieffieid. This is clear from the equation 13. It is not practical to get the carrier mobility close to the saturation velocity because of requiring large current.DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION This invention is to obtain higher Hall voltage or magnetic sensitivity than the conventional device. With the magneto sensitive device according to this invention, the magnetic sensitivity increases by about three power 103 because of large carrier velocity and the device can be utilized for highly sensitive measurement, witch head and so on. According to this invention, the carriers run in the depletion layer of the reversely biased junction, which are injected from the near junction which is forwardly biased, The carrier velocity fs determined by the voltage across the reversely biased junction and the carrier current density is determined by the voltage across the forwardly biased junction, either independently.Accordingly, the carrier velocity can increase close to the saturation velocity in the depletion layer without increasing the current.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig 1 is a perspective view showing the diagramatical structure of this invention, and Figs. 2 and 3 are a plan view of an embodiment of the magneto sensitive semiconductor device according to the invention and a cross sectional view on the A A line respectively.BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Fig. 1 diagramatically shows first, second and third regions 1, 2 and 3 of N, P and N types, respectively.There are provided a voltage supply source applying a forward bias voltage to a first PN junction 4 between the first and second regions 1 and 2, and a voltage supply source applying a reverse bias voltage to a second PN junction 5 between the second and third regions 2 and 3.A transistor 10 is constructed which has emitter, base and collector made of the first, second and third regions 1, 2 and 3, respectively, and in which the carriers move from the emitter 1 to the collector 3 in X axis direction .The Z axis component of magnetic field applied to the transistor along the thickness d of the substrate is sensed. The Hall voltage is induced along width W of the substrate Y axis direction and output electrodes 6 and 7 are provided at the both sides of a depletion layer region 8 of the second junction 5. Electrons in the emitter region 1 are injected through the forwardly biased emitter base junction 4 into the base region 2 and reach the depletion layer 8 as the base width in the X axis direction is sufficiently smaller than the diffusion length of the electron.The electrons are accelerated therein by the collector base voltage up to its saturation velocity and reach the collector region 3. Since the magnitude of the electric field applied to the reversely biased junction can be very large as compared without junction, the carrier velocity can be readily close to its saturation velocity. While the electron current density through the depletion layer 8 is determined by the emitter base voltage, this voltage need not be increased so as to get large electron velocity.That is, controlling the carrier velocity is indepent from controlling the carrier current density. The Hall electric field is generated along the y axis when the z axis component of the magnetic flux density acts on the space charge region carriers running in the x direction. The output electrodes 6 and 7 are provided to face the depletion layer region 8 of the collector base junction 5. The collector region 3 must have such low impurity concentration that the depletion layer should readily extend, and the collector base voltage must be such a value that the depletion layer should reach the output electrodes 6 and 7. When the carrier velocity is close to the saturation velocity, the carrier mobility and hence the Hall voltage are little influenced by temperature. Referring to Figs. 2 and 3 an embodiment of this invention will be explained. An N type siiicon substrate 21 of 300 thickness and 40 Qcm resistivity is provided as a collector region and p type base andN type emitter regions 22 and 23 are formed by double diffusion. An N type collector region 24 is diffused distant from the base by 24 P. At just between the base and collector N regions 22 and 24 formed are two N type output regions 25 and 26, which are apart from each other by 12 p . All the above regions are formed on one major surface of the substrate 21, and the emitter, collector N and output regions 23, 24, 25 and 26 are diffused at the same time.Emitter, base, collector and output regions are provided with electrodes, respectively, and the surface of the substrate is passivated by an SiO2 layer 27. The output regions 25 and 26 may be formed of P type to be a diode structure in place of two ohmic N regions. There may be a pair of diodes in parallel and opposite polarity, to which suitable biasings are applied to controll the output level. The magneto sensitive device may be formed not only in a silicon substrate but also in a silicon epitaxial layer on an insulating crystalline substrate made of sapphire or the like, in which the thickness d of the current path can be small and the width W is selected by etching pattern of the silicon layer with plural devices on the same substrate. Further, the device may be formed in germanium a III V compound semiconductor of higher carrier mobility such as Ga As. The running carriers in the space charge region in solid are contrasted to electrons in vacuum, in which, the electrons run from a cathode to a plate in a vacuum tube and the Hall voltage is derived fton a pajr of output electrodes provide between the cathode and the plate. The alrge velocity of the carrier running in the space charge depletion region of semiconductor can be utilized for other than the Hall effect field. For example, a P type gate region of a mesh or grid shape may be formed in the depletion layer region 8 in palce of the output electordes 6 and 7, shown in Fig. 1, by which the carriers passing through the channel defined thereby, are used for the input of amplification. In this case, a fixed forward voltage is applied across the emitter base, an input signal is applied across the gate base or gateemitter, and a voltage supply source and a load, in series, are connected between the collector base or collect9r emitter. The large carrier velocity running through the channel tenders, the transistor showing high frequency characteristic and transconductance.
