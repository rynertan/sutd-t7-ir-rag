## Description
Electrical connector for term . atinc flat, multi conductor electrical cable. This invention relates to an electrical connector for tenninating a flat multi conductor electrical cable. In United States Patent Specification No.4,094,566 there is described such an electrical connector comprising a body member of electrically insulating material carrying on a surf ace thereof a row of electrical terminals each having a mating portion adjacent one edge of the body member surf ace and a conductor connection portion in the form of a slotted plate adapted to establish an electrical connection to a conductor of a flat multi conductor electrical cable by movement of the conductor transversely of its axis into the slot in the plate, in known manner. This known connector also includes a bus r e er arranged on the body member surface and providIng a plurality of integrally formed slotted plate portions in a row parallel to the row of slotted plate conductor connection portions of the terminals. For use of this known connector, an end portion of a cable to be tor.min ted is prepared by exposing the conductors thereof, and the conductors are then moved transversely of their axes into appropriate ones of the slotted plate portions of the terminals in the case of signal conductors and the bus member in the case of ground conductors. Thus, the signal conductors are terminated to individual terminals of the connector while the ground conductors are commoned by the bus membf r. The bus member iilitially has a slotted plate portion aligned with the slotted plate portion of each terminal, and also a slotted plate portion positioned between each adjacent pair of terminal slotted plate portions. Prior to conductor connection, those portions of the bus ember aligned with terminals to be connected to signal conductors are bent to an inoperative position so that a signal conductor can pass over each such portion without connection thereto. The known connector also includes a cover mamber adapted to be positioned over the body member surface and the terminals and bus member thereon, the inner surface of the cover member being formed with grooves to receive the conductors of the cable, and with transverse slots to receive the slotted plate portions of the terminals and bus member, whereby the conductors can be located in the grooves and the cover member then applied to the body member to urge the conductors into the slots in the associated slotted plate portions of the terminals and bus member. The connector specifically described in the above noted United States specification has a row of terminals on each of two opposite surfaces of the body member and a bus member which extends across both surfaces, the conductors of a cable to be terminated being separated into two groups for terminat .on on the two surfaces of the body menber respectively each surface then being covered by an individual cover member. According to this invention a known connector as discussed above is characterised in that the terminal carrying surfaces of the body member are turned with grooves to receive the conductors of a cable and direct the conductors to the conductor connection portions of the terminals and bus member, an edge of the body member being formed to guide the conductors to overlie the two surfaces of the body member as required. The connector of this invention has the advantage that the body member serves both to carry the terminals and bus member, and also to locate the conductors of a cable in the connector as required, whereby it is ensured that the conductors are accurately aligned with the conductor connection portions of the terminals and bus member. Further, only the body member is a relatively complex structure, it being possible for the cover members to be smooth surfaces and thus easy to manufacture. This invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the drawings, in which Fiaure 1 is a perspective view of an assembled connector according to the invention with a cable connected thereto and positioned over a contact post carrying substrate with which the connector is to be mated Figure 2 is an exploded perspective view of the connector of Figure 1 Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the manner in which the terminals are retained on the body member of the connector of.Figures 1 and 2 Figure 5 is a side view of the body member of the connector of Figures 1 and 2 Figur 6 is a sectional perspective view of part of e31 conductor guiding edge of the body member of Figure 5 Figure 7 is an exploded perspective view of a terminal and the associated part of the body manner of the connector of Figures 1 and 2 Figure 8 is a sectional side view of the connector of Figures 1 and 2 with the conductors of a cable posItioned for receipt in the grooves in the body member of the connector Figure 9 is a view similar to Figure 8 but showing the conductors received in the grooves in the body members Figure 10 is a view similar to Figures 8 and 9 but showing the conductors connected and the cover mei bers of the connector in position Figure 11 is a view on the lines Xl XI in Figure 8 Figure 3.2 is a view on the line XII XII in Figure 9 Figure 13 is a view similar to Figure 1 but, showing another connector according to the invention Figure 14 is a view similar to Figure 2 but of the other connector of Figure 13 Figure 15 is a sectional side view of the connector of Figures 13 and 14 in a partly assembleÅa state Figure 16 is a view similar to Figure 15 but with the connector fully assembled Figure 17 is a transverse sectional view through the strain relief part of the connector of Figures 13 to 16 Figure 18 is an exploded perspective view of a different strain relief feature for the connector of Figures 13 to 17 and Figure 19 is a view similar to Figure 17 but through the feature of Figure 18. Referring to Figures 1 to 12, the connector comprises a body member 1 moulded from electrically insulating plastics material and carrying on each of its two opposite major surfaces, a row of electrical terminals 2 each stamped and formed from sheet metal, and having, as shown in Figure 7, a socket portion 3 adjacent one edge of the body member surface, and a conductor connection polo 4 in the form of a slotted plate adapted to establish an electrical connection to a conductor of a cable by movement of the conductor transversely of its axis into the slot in the plate, in known manner. The body member 1 also carries a bus member 5 stamped and formed from sheet metal and extending across both the major surfaces of the body member 1, the bus member 5 providing a plurality of integrally formed slotted plate portions 6 in two rows parallel to the two rows of slotted plate conductor connection portions 4 of the two rows of terminals 2 respectively. The connector also comprises two cover members 7 and 8 each moulded from electrically insulating material and adapted to be latched in position over a respective major surface of the body member 1. As best seen in Figures 2 and 5, both the major surfaces of the body member 1 are formed with grooves 9 to receive.the conductors of a cable, and with transverse slots 10 to receive the slotted plate portions 4 and 6 of the terminals 2 and bus member 5, respectively. As shown in Figure 6, each groove 9 opens to an edge of the body member 1 by way of a funnel entry mouth 11 defined by three converging walls, namely two side walls 12 and a base wall 13. The base walls 13 are arranged with some on each side of the central longitudinal plane of the body member 1 such that conductors inserted into the mouths 11 will be guided to one or the other surface of the body member 1. Adjacent the position where it opens into the mouth 11 each groove 9 is formed at each edge with an upstanding ridge 14 which is used to secure a conductor in the groove 9 as will be explained below. As shown in Figure 7, each terminal 2 is received in a cavity 15 in the body member 1, with an intermediate portion 16 of the terminal 2 joining the receptacle portion 3 and the slotted plate portion 4 being received in a slot 17 joining the cavity 15 to the slot 10 which receives the 5 lotted plate portion 4. The terminal intermediate portion 16 is formed with a recess 18 which receives a projection 19 in the slot 17 to locate the termina 2 correctly. Referring now to Figures 3 and 4 also, each longitudinal edge of the cavity 15 is formed with an upstanding ridge 20 which after insertion of a terminal 2 is turned over the cavity 15, as shown in Figure 4, in order to retain the terminal 2 in the cavity 15.The free end wall 21 of the cavIty 15 is formed with an aperture 22 by way of which a male terminal post Figure 1 can be inserted into the receptacle portion 3 of a terminal 2 in the cavIty 15. Referring now to Figures 8, 9 and 10, in order to tenninate a flat multi conductor cable, 100 in Figure 1, with the connector, the insulation is stripped from an ond portion of the cable to expose the conductors 101, some of which in use constitute signal conductors and are to be connected to respective terminals 2, and the others of which in use constitute ground conductors and are to he connected to the bus member 5. The cable 100 is then advanced axially towards the mouths 11 of the grooves 9 in the body member 1, with the open sides of the mouths 11 closed by wiping members 200 of a tool not shown in detail.The mouths 11 guide the conductors 101 to overlie the two major surfaces of the body member 1, as shown in Figure 8. The wiping members 200 are then moved over the surfaces of the body member 1 downwards as seen in the drawings to the position shown inFigure 9, during which movement they urge the conductors 101 into respective grooves 9 in the body member 1. As shown in Figures 11 and 12, the wiping members 200 also deform the ridges 14 to overlie the conductors 101 after insertion into the grooves 9 whereby the conductors 101 are retained in the grooves 9. A further tool 300 Figure 9 is then used to urge the conductors 101 into the slotted plate portions 4 and 6 of the terminals 2 and bus member 5 as appropriate, this in known manner. The cover members 7 and 8 are then applied to the body member 1, as shown in Figure 10, and are secured to the body member 1 by pegs 23 seeFigure 2 on hoth cover members 7 and 8 which engage in holes 24 in the body member 1, pegs 25 on the cover member 8, which extend through holes 26 in the body member 1. and engage in holes 27 in the cover member 7, and pegs S28 on the cover member 7, which engage in holes 29 Figure 10 in the cover member 8. As shown in Figures 2 and 10, the cover members 7 and 8 are formed, at the cable exit end of the connector with longitudinally offset transverse bars 29 and 30 respectively, whereby the cable 100 c formed into a sinuous path, shown in Figure 10, to provide strain relief against axial forces on the cable 100, for the connections between the conductors 101 and the terminals 2 and bus member 5. The assembled connector is then as shown inFigure 1, and can be mated with an apprQnriate array of male terminal posts 400 carried by a substrate 401 to provide required connections between the conductors 101 of the cable 103 and the posts 400. Referring now to Figures 13 to 17, the connector here shown Is similar in design in function to the connector of Figures 1 to 12, and corresponding parts have the same references. The essential differences are in the general shape of the connector, the manner in which the cover members 7 and 8 are secured to the body member 1, and the manner in which strain relief. is provided by the cover members 7 and 8. As shown in Figures 14 and 15, the cover members 7 and 8 are formed at the mating end lower end in the drawings of the connector with a row of projecting teeth 30 arranged and adapted to engage in the male contact receiving apertures 22, as shown in Figures 15 and 16, to secure the cover members 7 and 8 to the body member 1 at that end. Thus, after connection of the conductors 10 to the terminals 2 and bus member 5, as described with reference to Figures 1 to 12, the teeth 30 are engaged in the apertures 22, as shown in Figure 15, and the cover members 7 and 8 then closed onto the body member 1, as shown in Figure 16.Each cover member 7 or 8 is formed at one side with a latch arm 31 having at its free end an inwardly directed projection 32 arranged and adapted to engage in a recess 33 in the other cover member 8 or 7 thereby to latch the cover members 7 and 8 together and thus to the body member 1, as shown in Figure 16 Each cover member 7 or 8 also carries on its inner surface a row of stop members 34 which after latching of the cover members 7 and 8 to the body member 1, are located behind the receptacle portions 3 of the terminals 2, and serve to prevent over insertion of a male contact 400 in Figure 13 into the receptacle, thus preventing damage to the connection between the terminal 2 and a conductor 101. As its latching end upper end in the each cover member 7 or 8 is formed. at one side with a tapered V shaped projection 35, and at the other side with a correspondingly shaped recess 36 arrangod and adapted to receive the projection 35 of the other cover member 8 or 7, with the cable 100 located between the projections 35 and recesses 36. Thus, on latching of the cover members 7 and 8 together, the cable 100 is distorted in two directions, as shown in Figures 16 and 17, and very effective strain relief is provided for the connections between the conductors 101 and the terminals 2 and bus member 5. In the modified connector shown in Figures 18 and 19, the ridges 35 and recesses 36 in the cover members 7 and 8 are simply block shaped with sloping ends instead of having the shapes shown in Figures 13 to 16.
