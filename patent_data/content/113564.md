# Method and apparatus for supplying sheet to winding unit.

## Abstract
A plurality of sets of sheet drive rollers 4a, 6, 7 including a touch roller 6 for urging a sheet 5 against a core are provided on a running path, along which a sheet is supplied to a core in a shaft drive type winding unit. Two adjacent ones of said sheet drive rollers are coupled to each other by a fine speed adjustment interlock mechanism 8 . The speed change ratio of the fine speed adjustment interlock mechanism 8 is adjusted to remove or reduce the variation in the tension in the sheet between the two rollers and also control the tension to a level suited for the winding.
