## Abstract
A method of fabricating structural components compris ing attaching a continuous resin wetted fibre to a mould. The mould is then rotated so as to wind the fibre into recesses of a pre determined shape in the mould. The resin is allowed to cure so as to form a channel cross section structure.

## Description
STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS The present invention relates to structural components and more particularly relates to structural components made from resin wetted fibres. The production of structural components such as parts of buildings, boats etc. by the technique of laying up resin wetted fibre glass in a mould is well known. However, this is a relatively labour intensive and time consuming process and further an extra step is required if it is necessary to inter connect separate components. Thus, according to the present invention there is provided a method of fabricating structural components comprising a attaching a continuous resin wetted fibre to a mould b rotating the mould c winding the fibre into recesses of a pre determined shape in the mould and d allowing the resin to cure. The mould is preferably removable from the cured structure and a mould release agent may be used to facilitate separation of the component from the mould. In one example the mould comprises two flat facing pieces of wood with a circumferential insert between to define the mould. The rotation of the mould may be achieved by use, for example, of a motor driven shaft or alternatively manual rotation may be used. Suitable materials for the manufacture of the structure described above are glass fibre or textile , roving or strands wetted with organic or chemical glues, paints, plastic materials, polythene, epoxy, urethanes, water glass mixed with cement, magnesium oxychloride, polyester resins and other kinds of plastics. The invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings. Figures 1 a and 1 b show two sections at right angles of a typical jig for winding channel section structural components. The jig 1 comprises a pair of rectangular wooden sheets 2 placed parallel to each other and maintained at a distance of about 3 inches apart by a circumferential insert 3 which is bolted to each of the wooden sheets 2. A rotatable shaft 4 passes centrally through and at right angles to the plane of the sheets 2 and is connected to a motor adapted to rotate typically at 60 rpm. The shape of the insert 3 is determined by the type of structural component to be formed but in the example it has a recess 9 of square U shape to form the channel section component. Figure 2 shows the method of producing the resin wetted fibres. The continuous wetted fibre was produced by passing four continuous bundles 5 of glass fibres together through a bath 6 of polyester resin and then through an orifice plate 7 to give a roughly uniform fibre diameter. The glass fibre rovings used wereVetrotex EC 14,2400 Tex produced by St Gobain Industries and each bundle contained about 208 fibres of about 10 microns diameter. The polyester resin used was Cellobond A 2785 CV HP Chemicals Limited with a catalyst and accelerator. The formulations were chosen so that easy wetting of the fibre occurred but with sufficient wetting to reduce run off tendency. During use, the wetted continuous fibre 8 from the resin bath 6 was fastened to the insert 3 of the jig. The jig 1 was then rotated and the wetted fibre 8 passed into the recess 9 of the insert 3.Rotation was continued until the wetted fibre 8 filled the recess 9 of the insert 3. At this stage the outer surface of the resin wetted fibres may be smoothed off by use of a wooden block or the like. The resin was then allowed to cure at room temperature for several hours dependent upon the formulation adopted. The wooden sheets 2 were then removed along with the inserts 3 to leave a channel cross section structure. The sheets and insert were initially coated with a suitable mould release agent to facilitate ease of separation of the cured structure. When making closed channel section structures, the insert is made in several pieces to enable ease of removal after curing. Figure 3 illustrates typical sections of structures which may be achieved by changing the shape of the insert. Figure 4 shows further structures which may be fabricated by placing two or more uncured or cured closed structures adjacent to each other and then rotating them and winding further resin wetted continuous fibres around the periphery, the further structure being subsequently allowed to cure. Also three dimensional structures may be produced in this way be winding resin wetted fibres around, say, two structures set at right angles. After the structure has been wound and cured, the structure may be divided along a line of symmetry to form two or more identical structures. Some examples of this are shown in Figure 6.
