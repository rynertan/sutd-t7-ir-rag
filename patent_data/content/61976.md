# Purification of ammonium tungstate solutions.

## Abstract
Prior to evaporative crystallization of ammonium tung state solutions to give ammonium paratungstate APT , an aluminum compound, e.g. aluminum sulfate solution, is added to precipitate silicon and phosphorus impurities. The yield of crystallized ammonium paratungstate is thereby increased.
