## Description
The enzymatic protein rennin has long been known as usefulfor coagulating milk casein in cheese making. It is also usedin connection with cheese ripening because of its specificproteolytic activity. In the past, it has been obtained fromrennet in commercial manufacture. Milk fed calves can bebutchered and the fourth stomach removed freed of its foodcontent. A complicated method is then used wherein the stomachsare dried, salted, and frozen. At factory points, the stomachsare washed, freed of salt and treated to remove surface fat.They are then stretched on racks and dried. The dried stomachsare often cold stored then ground and placec into large vatswith a brine solution circulated through the skins untilextraction of rennin is completed. he above procedure forpreparing rennin is costly, and presents many difficulties inproducing large amounts needed for commercial use in variousapplications throughout the world. It is an object of this invention to obtain living cellswhich are capable of producing rennin in culture for volume production. It is a still further object of this invention to obtainliving cells which are capable of producing prorennin in culturefor volume production. It is a still further object of this invention to obtainliving cells which are capabie of producing pre prorennin inculture for volume production. It is another object of this invention to provide rennin,prorennin, or pre prorennin derived from living cells inaccordance with the preceding objects which living cells containgenetic material derived from recombinant DNA material. It is still another object of this invention to providespecialized rennin genes, pre prorennin genes and prorenningenes. It is still another object of this invention to providemethods of producing rennin, prorennin or pre prorennin usingrecombinant DNA techniques. It is still another object of this invention to providesignal sequences for use in transporting selected amino acidsequences such as selected enzymes or protein material toperiplasmic space, other cellular areas or extracellularly withthe appropriate host. It is still another object of this invention to provideparticular modified cells for use in production of polypeptidesdisplaying rennin or milk clotting activity. The subject matter of the invention is as claimed in claims 1 to 23. According to the invention, transformable living cells selected from the groupconsisting of fungi, yeast and bacteria other than E.coli contain genetic material derived fromrecombinant DNA material and are capable of expressing bovine rennin or pre prorennin orprorennin. Expression ofpre prorennin in a host cell can be obtained by generating a DNAsequence that codes for pre prorennin. That sequence hasattached to it a transcriptional promoter and a ribosomal binding site at the 5 end and the distance between thebeginning of the DNA that codes for pre prorennin and thesegment of DNA carrying the promoter and binding site isvaried. The DNA is then transformed into host cells. The hostcells are cloned and those that have high levels of expressionof pre prorennin are selected. In a method of obtaining expression of prorennin or renninin host cells, a DNA sequence that codes for pre prorennin andhaving a 5 end is selected. A portion is removed from the 5 end which portion codes for the prorennin or rennin precursorpolypeptide. The remainder bearing the prorennin or rennincoding sequence is ligated onto a synthetic piece of DNAcarrying a translational initiation codon at the 3 end of thepiece. One then proceeds as before by attaching atranscriptional promoter and ribosomal binding site to thesequence and varying the distance between the beginning of theDNA that codes for prorennin or rennin and the segment of DNAcarrying the promoter and ribosane binding site. This materialis transformed into host cells, cloning is carried out andselection of the cells that express prorennin or rennin asdesired and selected above is carried out. Yeast microorganisms prepared by the process describedherein are exemplified by cultures deposited in the AmericanType Culture Collection of 12301 Park Warren Drive, Rockville,Maryland 20852 and identified as Accession No. 20623 which isstrain CGY116 a derivative of Pre prorennin,prorennin and rennin can each be obtained by isolation of pre prorennin DNA material. The pre prorennin is a precursor ofprorennin. By removingportions of the pre prorennin DNA, one could obtain geneticmaterial which will code for prorennin or for rennin. Pre prorennin, prorennin or rennin genes in accordance withthis invention comprise any nucleotide sequences coding for theamino acid sequence of pre prorennin, prorennin or renninrespectively and exclude any intervening nucleotide sequencespresent in the genomic DNA encoding pre prorennin, prorennin orrennin respectively and are attached to vectors whichreplicate in suitable host cells other than E.coli. The cells are capable ofexpressing recombinant DNA material to produce the desiredenzymatic protein. Yeast, fungi and bacteria other than E.coli can be usedaccording to the invention. These cells are selected to be capable of producing largequantities of the enzymatic protein under reasonable commercialculture conditions. The enzyme rennin EC 3.4.23.4 , which is referred to inthis application is also known as chymosin. It is the majorproteolytic protein found in the stomach of the pre ruminantcalf and is responsible for clotting milk. Rennin is usedcommercially for the production of cheese. Prorennin is aprecursor form of rennin having 42 additional amino acids at theamino terminal end as described by B. Foltmann et al, For the purposes of this application, the prorennin gene isdefined as any sequence of nucleotides wnich codes for theprorennin molecule, the amino acid sequence of which isdescribed in the literature B. Foltmann, V.B.Pedersen,H.Jacobsen, D.Kauffman, and G.Wybrandt, The pre prorennin gene includes the sequence of nucleotidescoding for prorennin, but also includes 48 additionalnucleotides on the 5 end which code for the amino terminalprecursor polypeptide found on the pre prorennin enzyme. The rennin gene is defined as any sequence of nucleotideswhich code for the prorennin molecule excluding the first 126nucleotides which encode the proenzyme portion of prorennin. The living cells are prepared in the first instance byusing a plurality, of known DNA technologies starting withmaterials obtained from the fourth stomach of a calf. The rennin,pre prorennin and prorennin obtained can be used incheese making to clot milk to obtain cheese and perhaps in othercommercial applications to clot milk to obtain cheese. Largevolumes can be produced by culture techniques. Thus largeamounts of materials are capable of being produced at reasonableproduction rates and costs. The genetic recombinant DNAmaterial is substantially identical to the rennin portion ofthe calf pre prorennin gene when rennin is to be produced,substantially identical to the calf pre prorennin gene whenpre prorennin is to be produced and substantially identical tothe prorennin portion of the calf pre prorennin gene when prorennin is to be produced. The differences in the recombinantDNA material relate mainly to the molecules being devoid ofintrons that may exist in the calf gene. Any species of bacteria which is considered safe forrecombinant DNA work can be used, including, for example, The host cells into which the desired recombinant DNAmaterial is introduced are preferably derivatives of The cells can be grown by conventional culturingtechniques. For example, culture media for the The cultures can be grown in suspension, plated on agarmedium, or other standard tissue and cell culture techniques canbe used. The culture media used can be any of the standard culturemedia for growing the particular cells. For example, TY mediumwith the cells initially seeded at a level of 1 to 4 where In standard techniques, the Various media known for growing cells can be used and formno part of the present invention. Similarly a variety ofgrowing methods, techniques and conditions can be used. Forexample, while the cells are preferably grown at temperatures offrom 30 degrees C to 40 degrees C, temperatures outside of thisrange can be used. The starting point for obtaining the cells of the presentinvention is the use of recanbinant DNA techniques known in theart to obtain the genetic material desired and to insert it intothe host cell after which the host cell is cloned. Preferably, the rennin gene, pre prorennin gene orprorennin gene which one wishes to ultimately clone in anorganism is isolated in a first step by obtaining messenger RNAof the pre prorennin gene from a tissue source. In the case ofthe calf, this is obtained by isolation from the fourth calfstomach. The messenger RNA can be isolated as by the method ofDeeley et al R.G. Deeley, J.I.Gordon, A.T.H. Burns, K.P.Millinix, M.Bina Stein, R.F. Goldberger The messenger RNA is then converted to double stranded DNAby conventional means. First, the complimentary copy of the DNA is made from the messenger RNA by conventional recanbinant DNAmeans as by the use of AMV reverse transcriptase. For example,the methods of A.Efstratiadis, F.C. Kafatos, A.M. Maxam and T.Maniatis, Next, enzymes such as Thirdly, synthetic linkers can be attached to both ends ofthe double stranded DNA as for example by the use of Hind III orEco Rl synthetic oligonucleotide linkers using conventionalmethods such as described in R.H. Scheller, T.L. Thomas, A.S.Lee, W.H.Klein, W.D. Niles, R.J. Britten and E.H. Davidson, In a fourth step, the DNA molecule is integrated into thechromosome or attached to a vector which can be a plasmid, virusor cosmid as known in the art. Such vectors include In a fifth step, the recanbinant DNA molecule can beintroduced into the cytoplasm of the host cell line usingconventional procedures such as described in M. Mandel A. Higa 1970 Recognition of the correct clone may be accomplished by themethod ofhybridization selection or by probing with syntheticoligonucleotides, T. Taniguchi, Y. Fujii, Kuriyama and M.Muramatsu, The newly modified host cell is then cloned and expressionof the material desired obtained. For example, the technique ofGuarente et al using the lactose operon promoter, 1980 L.Guarente, G. Lauer, T.M. Roberts M. Ptashne, The following examples illustrate the production of pre prorennin A, prorennin A or rennin A byrecombinant means more specifically. The expression of pre prorennin, prorennin and rennin,respectively, in E.coli cells, vectors which comprise a corresponding gene and which replicate inE.coli cells, and E.coli cells transformed with such vector do not form part of the invention, withthe exception of plasmid pCGE 21 as claimed in claim 9 and the E.coli cells as claimed in claims8 and 10. Stomach tissue from milk fed calves was obtained fresh froma local slaughterhouse the mucosa of the fourth stomach wasdissected away from the stomach wall and frozen in dry ice.Twenty one grams of the mucosal tissue was disrupted by means ofa blender into 200 ml of cold buffer 10 degrees C consistingof 50mM Tris About 8.7 µg of cDNA was synthesized from 20 µg of the calfstomach poly A containing RNA by incubation for one hour at 42degrees C in 50mM Tris The Sl treated double stranded cDNA 1.7 µg was incubatedin Buffer T 25mM Tris The reaction was adjusted to 10mM EDTA pH8 and fractionatedon a Biogel A 150m column 0.7cm x 20cm .

Foltmann Strain CGE24 is The pre prorennin gene contains three recognition sites forthe restriction endonuclease Hha I recognizes GCGC see Table1 , one of which removes the pre signal sequence and leaves thesequence for prorennin minus the first nucleotide G for thealanine codon. Accordingly, we isolated this partial HhaIdigestion product which represents a nearly intact prorenningene. Eighteen µg of RFI doublestranded DNA from recanbinantphage 293 118 37 was cut with 12 units of restriction endonucleaseHind III N.E. Biolabs in 50 µl of Buffer H for one hour at37 C.

DNA which corresponds to the uncut plus the singly cut piecemissing about 25 nucleotides from the beginning of 293 118 37 wasisolated from a band on a 2 agarose gel. Plasmid pBR322 DNA 10µg was cut with restriction endonuclease Hind III N.E. Biolabs, 9units in 100 µl of Buffer H for one hour at 37 C. The DNA wasphenol extracted and ethanol precipitated. About 0.5 pmoles ofeach DNA i.e., the partial HhaI cut 293 118 37 and the Hind IIIcut pBR322 were combined, redissolved in 28 µl of water, andrendered blunt ended by treatment with DNA polymerase I Boehringer Mannheim, 9 units in a 40 µl reaction containingBuffer D 60mM Tris About 5 µg of the pCGE 181 DNA will be cut with Xba I N.E.Biolabs, 4 units for one hour at 37 C in a 50 µl reactioncontaining Buffer X 150mM NaCl, 6mM Tris In order to obtain DNA carrying only the rennin codingsequence, the RFI DNA from recombinant plage 293 207 was resectedwith the nuclease Bal 31 and ligated into an fl phage vector. Theligation products were cloned, and a library of resected renninDNA was prepared. Specifically, 8 µg of 293 207 phage RFI DNA wascut with 6 units Hind III N.E. Biolabs in a 20 µl reaction containing Buffer H for one hour at 37 C. After phenol and etherextraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA was redissolved in20 µl of water and treated with 1.25 units Bal 31 N.E. Biolabs in a 50 µl reaction containing Buffer B for 30 minutes at 30 C.The reaction was stopped by phenol extraction and ethanolprecipitation. Bal 31 resected DNA fragments in the size range500 1000 bp were isolated from a 1.5 agarose gel by thefreeze thaw technique referred to above. The resected DNA wasrendered blunt ended by treatment with DNA polymerase I Boehringer Mannheim, 9 units in a 40 µl reaction containingBuffer D for 10 minutes at 10 C. Synthetic oligonucleotidelinkers specifically, Hind III 8 mer CAAGCTTG 5.0 µg fromCollaborative Research, Inc. were kinased with We will determine the amount of rennin synthesized by subjecting a lysate of cells carrying the plasmid to radioimmuneassay using iodinated authentic purified rennin and anti renninserum.

Double stranded recombinant flphage 293 118 37 DNA 200 µg was digested with the restrictionendonuclease PstI N.E. Biolabs, 20 units for 150 minutes at 37 Cin a 100 µl reaction containing Buffer P. Eleven microliters of100mM Tris A second treatment of the DNA with the Klenow fragment of Preparation of the vector DNA began with digestion of 3.3µg of pBR322 DNA with 5.4 units of ClaI endonuclease Boehringer Mannheim for one hour at 37 C in a 30 µl reactioncontaining ClaI buffer.

These two DNA pieces were ligated together in a 29 µlreaction containing Buffer L and T Generating the second of the three plasmids required forthis construction required the subcloning of therennin containing Hind III fragment of recombinant phage293 118 37 doublestranded DNA. Generation of the third component needed for constructionof the rennin producing plasnid required digestion of 2 µg ofpGL101 L. Guarente, G. Lauer, T.M. Roberts and M. Ptashne 1980 see above DNA with restriction endonuclease PvuII N.E.Biolabs, 5 units for one hour at 37 C in a 20 ul reactioncontaining Buffer H plus 10mM 2 mercaptoethanol.

The ampicillin resistant plasmidsderived from the transformed cells will be analyzed by size,restriction enzyme digestion, and DNA sequence to find thedesired plasmid pCGE305 which will bear the ATG rennin sequenceunder transcriptional control of the These three species, pre prorennin, methionine prorenninand methionine valine rennin may be expressed in First, a more complete deletion of the DNA coding for the 5 end of the pre prorennin, prorenninand rennin will be obtained as follows. DNA coding for thepre prorennin gene carrying the ATG translation initiation codonand less than 20 nucleotides to the 5 side of the ATG will beobtained from the Bal31 resected rennin DNA fl plage bankdescribed in Section 8 above by screening those phage usingrestriction enzymes coupled with gel electrophoresis andsequencing by the Sanger method F. Sanger In order to obtain expression in yeast of each of thesepieces of DNA, the following experiments may be performed. theDNA coding for pre prorennin, met prorennin, met val rennin ormet rennin will be cut out of the appropriate phage or plasmiddescribed above. The piece will be further cut with SmaI, andthe desired fragment coding for a form of rennin will bepurified by gel electrophoresis. Similarly, a BamHI blunted to SalI piece of DNA coding for the ZYA segment from Due to the ready availability of a plasmid pRB71 M. Roseand D. Botstein, submitted for publication which resembles thedeletion 35 of In order to obtain efficient expression of prorennin inyeast, the In order to obtain expression of a prorennin fusion protein i.e., fused to the first 11 nucleotides of the In the first construction, the 5 portion of the prorenningene was inserted into the BamHI site of pRB71 such that this result suggested that a similar plasmid should directthe expression of a Meanwhile, about 15 µg of recombinant fl phage 293 118 37double stranded DNA was cut with 12 units of Hind III N.E.Biolabs for 2 hours at 37 C in 100 µl of Buffer H. Afterphenol and ether extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA 6 µg was rendered blunt ended by treatment with 10 units The ethanol precipitated pCGS16 DNA which had been cut withBglII and SalI endonuclease was redissolved in 13 µl water alongwith the gel purified 293 118 37 BglII Hind III SalI linkered DNA fragment and the two pieces were ligated together in a 20 plreaction containing Buffer L and 600 units T Accordingly, the yeast strain CGY80 was transformed withthe plasmid DNA by the method of A. Hinnen, J.B. Hicks, and G.Fink 1978, see above and leucine prototrophs were selected.One such transformant, CGY116, was grown to exponential phase inminimal medium containing the appropriate amino acidsupplements, labelled with 100 uCi Strain CGY116 is With reference again to Table 1, the nucleotide and aminoacid sequence of preprorennin A as shown, illustrates thenucleotide sequences for several of the materials of thisinvention. These materials can be cut from the nucleotidesequence shown by conventional procedures. Similarly thepre prorennin A form can be changed to the prorennin B form bysubstituting a glycine residue at position number 290 in placeof the aspartate residue at this position. Useful products obtained from the pre prorennin A as shown in Table 1 include the following nucleotide sequences forming part of the recombinant material As used herein, the term genetic material derived fromrecombinant DNA material indicates the genetic material of thehost cells which have been transformed with recombinant DNA andcloned to obtain cells which carry the genetic information forthe desired product. Recombinant DNA material is used in itsnormal sense to denote DNA derived from two or more differentsources joined or spliced together to form a single molecule butalso includes synthesized DNA obtained for example by chemicalsynthesis. Obviously the recombinant methods used to isolateand obtain the original recombinant DNA material may producehost cells which are then cloned and grown without the need forreuse of genetic recombinant methods. In such case, the clonedcells are considered to be derived from the cells which wereoriginally treated by recombinant DNA methods and are consideredto contain genetic material derived from recombinant DNAmaterial. As described above, recombinant DNA molecules are formedcomprising genes coding for at least one polypeptide displayingmilk clotting activity or useful in producing such polypeptides. Although specific prorennin, pre prorennin and rennin genesare specifically set forth in FIG. 1, it should be understoodthat these terms as used herein include functional equivalentsthereof having any changes in nucleotide or amino acid sequencesor alterations which do not significantly affect milk clottingor catalytic activity of the final rennin product. Thus thebroad term rennin as used in rennin, pre prorennin andprorennin is meant to include any sequence of amino acids thatclots mammalian milk such as bovine or goat s milk, and thus mayinclude selected fragments of rennin as previously sequenced inthe prior art. The rennin, pre prorennin and prorennin can have non functional amino acid sequences attached thereto which canbe removed by conventional methods to enhance the desiredactivity of the polypeptide. As mentioned above, calf rennin exists in two allelic formsA and B which differ at the 290 amino acid sequence position andpossibly at the 204 position. Although the cloning andexpression of rennin A is described here, a gene for rennin Bmay be readily generated from the A form gene by simpletechniques outlined below. Expression of rennin B may beobtained in a manner identical to that described here for the Aform. In order to generate a gene for rennin B,oligonucleotides spanning the regions which are to be changedand including the desired changes could be chemicallysynthesized. For example, two 20 mer oligonucleotides, one ofsequence identical to nucleotides 847 866 Table 1 exceptnucleotide 856 is changed from an A to a G, and one of sequenceidentical to nucleotides 1099 1118 Table 1 except nucleotide1109 is changed from A to G, would be synthesized and used toprime second strand DNA synthesis off of fl phage 293 118 37double stranded DNA which had been randomly nicked and convertedto single strands with endonuclease III by the method of R.B.Wallace Although the methods of this invention describe startingwith RNA material it is also possible to start by isolating thegene derived from the genomic DNA. In that case the interveningsequences would be first spliced out or a suitable host organismwould be used which is capable of processing the RNA to removeintervening sequences. It is also possible to start bychemically synthesizing the appropriate RNA or DNA, or portionsthereof, and then employing procedures described hereinultimately to obtain the expression of either rennin,pre prorennin and or prorennin. Furthermore, cloned genes forthe milk clotting proteins of other organisms, such as sheep,goat, pig or water buffalo, which may produce rennin likeenzymes can be generated using the procedures described here.
