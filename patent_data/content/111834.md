# Stainless steel.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a fully austenitic, nonmagnetic stainless steel which maintains the carbon concentration of the final steel near the solubility limit for carbon in the steel and adds columbium in an amount sufficient to stabilize the steel by columbium s preferential scavenging of carbon over chromium. This preferential scavenging substantially eliminates chromium carbide for mation at grain boundaries in the solid solution of the final stainless steel product. A highly preferred stainless steel consists essentially of, by weight 16 20 Manganese, 12 15 Chromium, 5.0 Molybdenum max., 2.5 Nickel max., 1.0 Copper max., 0.75 Silicon max., 0.2 0.5 Nitrogen, 0.04 Phosphorus max., 0.01 Sulfur max., 0.035 Carbon max., Columbium at a concentration of at least ten times the Carbon concentration, and the remainder being essentially Iron with incidental impurities.
