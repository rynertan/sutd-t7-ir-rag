# Data communication network.

## Abstract
A data communication network 10 over which data handling devices 14 can transmit and receive packets among themselves has a bus 22 , a number of subnetworks 12 each having interfaces for connecting a number of devices to each subnetwork , a concentrator 20 for connecting each in terface to the bus, each concentrator having a transceiver 110 for transmitting, to the bus and to devices connected to each subnetwork, packets originating from devices within a subnetwork transmitted packets , and for receiving from the bus packets originating from other subnetworks received packets , collision avoidance circuitry for monitoring transmis sion attempts by devices connected to the subnetwork, for detecting competing transmission attempts that would create a collision on the subnetwork, and, upon such detection, per mitting a selected attempt to enter the subnetwork, while preventing other attempts from entering it, collision detection circuitry for monitoring the bus and preventing all attempted transmissions from entering the bus whenever a packet from another subnetwork is present on the bus, circuitry for generating a collision signal upon detecting competing transmission attempts, a network interface unit NIU 16 associated with each device to cause withdrawal of an attemp ted transmission by that device upon receipt of a collision signal, a transmit channel over which transmitted packets are transmitted to the bus, a receive channel over which received packets are transmitted to devices connected to each subnet work, a station interface unit SIU 18 intermediate the NIU and concentrator, a first transmit connector over which transmitted packets pass from the NIU to the SIU, a receive connector over which received packets pass from the SIU to the NIU, a collision signal connector over which collision signals pass from the SIU to the NIU, a second transmit connec tor over which transmitted packets pass from the SIU to the transmit channel, a combined receive and collision signal con nector over which collision signals pass from the concentrator to the SIU, and over which received packets pass from the receive channel to the SIU, and demultiplexing circuitry in the SIU for routing collision signals to the collision signal connector and received packets to the receive connector.
