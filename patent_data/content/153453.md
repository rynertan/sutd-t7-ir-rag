# V belt transmission apparatus.

## Abstract
A V belt type power transmission apparatus for stepless variable change speed transmission comprises a large number of V shaped metallic members 4 disposed in series along on an endless metallic belt 3 to form, as a whole, a V belt assembly 2 , and this assembly 2 is applied between V pulleys 1 on a driving side and a driven side for effecting a power transmission, and each of the respective V shaped metallic members 4 is mounted, at its groove 5 made therein and open outwards, on the metallic belt 3 from inside the belt, and a stopper member 6 positioned outside an outer surface of each of the metallic belts 3 is provided in the groove 5 for preventing the V shaped metallic member 4 from coming off inwards. Respective end portions 5a 6a on both sides in the groove 5 width direction of the V shaped metallic member 4 , of the stopper member 6 are so in engagement with respective groove wall portions on both sides of the groove 5 of the V shaped metallic member 4 as to be positioned inner than the outer surface position of the metallic belt 3 . Said metallic members 4 may have curved engaging grooves 9 in which engage correspond ingly bent end portions 6a of said stopper member 6 .
