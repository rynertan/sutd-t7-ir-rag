A system for the detection, location and extraction of an intrauterine device IUD including a magnetic IUD, a locator probe 20 to be used intravaginally and an extractor probe 10 to be used intrauterinally, both containing at least one Hall ef fect generator. The probe is inserted into the patient and an in dicator means 30 is provided to communicate the presence of the IUD, in the case of the locator, or the distance of the IUD from the probe, in the case of the extractor. After positioning the extractor next to the IUD using the indicator for guidance, grasping means 14 in the extractor is actuated to effect tem porary attachment of the IUD to the extractor which is then withdrawn from the uterus.
