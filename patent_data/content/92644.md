## Description
CORROSION RESISTANT CONDUCTIVE GLASS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThe invention is an alkali corrosion resistant conductive high temperature glass composite using ruthenium dioxide and zirconia glass. Description of the Prior ArtThe quest for corrosion resistant electrodes for miniature precision work such as printheads has led to the use of noble metal in glass techniques and various printed circuit techniques involving conductors embedded in ceramic. Printheads and other precision electrode devices are known to suffer from corrosion problems when operated in an alkaline environment.The use of ruthenium dioxide sintered in a binder layer of low melting point glass in a thin film has been described by C. J. Sambucetti andH. K. Seitz, Sintering of Powdered RuO2 to Fabricate ElectrodeStructures, IBM Technical Bulletin, Vol. 23, No. 9, February 1981.U. S. Patent 4,000,346, Dowell, Optically Transparent, ElectricallyConductive Coating, issued December 28, 1976, describes a technique for depositing a thin film of a noble metal oxide such as ruthenium on the surface of an optically transparent substrate such as glass. Dowell also describes mixing a valve metal oxide titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum, and wolfram with the noble metal oxide to increase resistance to thermal decomposition, abrasion and agressive chemical environments. The coating includes no silicon dioxide, no aluminum oxide, no sodium oxide, no potassium oxide and no lithium oxide. It is a coating, not a glass. U. S. Patent 3,006,775, Chen, Ceramic Material and Method of Making the Same, issued October 31, 1961, describes a glass containing zirconium dioxide but no ruthenium dioxide. U. S. Patent 4,100,050, Cook et al, Coating Metal Anodes to DecreaseConsumption Rates, issued July 11, 1978, describes coating metal anodes to decrease consumption rates. It describes using ruthenium dioxide as a coating on a titanium electrode, but as a coating, not a glass.other techniques for using layers of RuO2, RuO2 powder in plastic and other deposition techniques are disclosed in the following U.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is an object of the invention to provide a conductive glass composite which combines the required conductivity with wear resistance and resistance to corrosion by alkalies and yet has a satisfactory thermal expansion and a high melting point.Another object of the invention is to form a conductive glass composite of ruthenium dioxide fine particles in about 1 6 to 2 1 ratio with a high melting point, high alkali resistance zirconia glass.A conductive glass composite is prepared of ruthenium dioxide fine particles, in a ratio of 1 6 to 2 1 Ru02 to zirconium dioxide bearing glass frit, fired to a temperature of 800 1000 C, which is sufficient to glaze the composite without destroying the conductive properties of the ruthenium dioxide. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGThe FIGURE is a not to scale depiction of the composite nature of the alkali resistant conductive glass of the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGThe FIGURE shows the alkali resistant conductive glass composite of the invention. Ruthenium dioxide particles 1 in the glass 2 provide conductive paths through the glass. The conduction mechanism includes contact between individual ruthenium dioxide particles, but in some cases the ruthenium dioxide particles are completely surrounded by glass but of such minimal thickness that the dielectric is not sufficient to inhibit conductivity. The conductivity via metal and ions is very small and can be neglected.In the FIGURE, contacts shown schematically provide a relatively low resistance connection of electrical current through the glass.

The resultant conductive composite material can then be used in the shape in which it was produced, or it can be ground into a fine powder and reformed to a desired shape and fired again. Alternatively, a paste may be made up of the glass frit and RuO2 and placed by known techniques such as silk screening in the desired configuration on or through holes in a ceramic substrate and then heated to 800 10000C sufficient to bond the composite to a substrate. This forms a conductive pattern with the personality required for complex electrical devices such as printheads. The resulting device is conductive and resistant to mechanical wear as well as alkali corrosion.The resulting conductive glass composite is also resistant to normal reagents such as water and acids. The invention provides an optimum wear resistance, alkali resistance and conductivity not known by previous formulations, and, in Ru02 glass frit ratios of 1 1 to 2 1 is particularly useful as an electrode for use in electrochemical printing.
