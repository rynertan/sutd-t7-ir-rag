## Description
Microorganism of the genus Serratia, method of producing the same and method for sroducinq L aspartic acid The present invention relates to a novel microorganism useful for production of L aspartic acid, a method for producing such a novel microorganism and a method for producing L aspartic acid using the microorganism. It has hitherto been known that Serratia marcescens has aspartase activity, and a method of enzymatic production of L aspartic acid frcm ammonium fumarate or fumaric acid and an ammonium salt by using such a microorganism has been also known. in the prior art JapanesePatent Publication No. 12553 1979 . However, aspartase activity of Serratia marcescens cased in such a conventional method is not so high as it is st,fficient for industrial production of L aspartic acid. ln addition, it has been known that, in the presence of a readily assimilable carbon source such as glucose, formation of an enzyme responsible for utilization of another carboii source in Serratia marcescens having aspartase actiltity is repressed, i.e. the microorganism is subjected to so called catabolite repression Biochem. J., 36, 619 1942 . Therefore, when cultivation of Serratia marcesce s is carried out by addition of a readily assimilabl B carbon source such as glucose to a medium, aspartase ativity of the microorganism is insufficiently high and, hence, the yield of L aspartic acid is decreased. Under these circumstances, in order to establish an industrially advantageous process for producing L aspartic acid, the present inventors have intensively studied. As the result, the present inventors have found that mutants having very high aspartase activity in comparison with that of their parent strain and being released from catabolite repression can be obtained by treating a microorganism of the genus Serratia to induce mutation and cultivating the treated microorganism in a certain medium and can be advantageously utilized in the production of L aspartic acid in an industrial scale. One object of the present invention is to provide a novel microorganism useful for industrial production ot L aspartic acid. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for,production such a novel microorganism. Still, another object of the present invention is to provide an industrially advantageous method for producingL aspartic acid. These objects as well as other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description. According to the present invention, there is provided novel microorganism of the genus Serratia having high aspartase activity and being released from catabolite repression and a method for producing such a novel microorganism comprising mutagenizing a microorganism of the genus Serratia having aspartase activity and being subjected to catabolite repression, cultivating the treated microorganism in a medium containing L aspartic acid either as a sole nitrogen source or as sole carbon and nitrogen sources and collecting a microorganism being able to grow in the medium.A method for producing L aspartic acid comprising contacting a culture of the novel microorganism, microbial cells collected from the culture or a processed material of the microbial cells with fumaric acid and ammonia to produce L aspartic acid and then collectingL aspartic acid thus produced is also provided. The novel microorganism of the genus Serratia having high aspartase activity and being released from catabolite repression of the present invention can be obtained by mutagenizing a parent strain, i.e., a micro organism of the genus Serratia having aspartase activit y and being subjected to catabolite repression, cultivating the treated microorganism in a medium containing L aspai tic acid either as a sole nitrogen source or as sole carbon and nitrogen sources to isolate a strain which can grow faster than the parent strain in the medium. The microorganism to be used as the parent strain is not limited to a specific one so far as it is a microoganism of the genus Serratia having aspartase activi. y. A suitable examples of the parent strain are Serrat .a marcescens SR41 FERM P 7014, Fermentation Research Institute FRI , Agency of Industrial Science andTechnoLogy, Ibaragi ken, Japan and Serratia marcescens, deposition number OUT 8259 Osaka University in Osaka Japan . T.1e mutagenesis of the parent strain can be carried out according to a conventional method. For example, the treatmert with N methyl N nitro N nitrosoguanidine or ultravio3zt radiation can be employed. The concentration of L aspartic acid in a medium used for cultivation of the microorganism treated by the mutagenesis is preferably about 0.005 to 5 regardless of using L aspartic acid either as a sole nitrogen source o as sole carbon and nitrogen sources. When L aspartic acid is used as a sole nitrogen source, glucose, sucrose or the like can be used as a carbon source. For example, when glucose is used, its concentration in the medium is preferably about 0.1 to 10 . Further, in both cases of using L aspartic acid as a sole nitrogen source and using it as sole carbon and nitrogen sources, various salts, trace elements and the like used for a conventional nutrient medium can be added to the medium. The method for cultivating the microorganism treated by the mutagenesis is not limited to a specific sne and the cultivation can be carried out according to a conventional method. For example, a so called continuous cultivation method ,Saikin, Phage Jikken ho the separate volume of Tampakushitsu, Kakusan, Koso , p 35 1972 can be suitably employed In such a method, the microorganism treated by the mutagenesis is inoculated in a flask containing a medium and the flask is incubated at 10 to 450C, preferably at 28 to 37 C with continuously pouring the additional medium into the flask at a constant rate of addition e.g., degree of dilution 0.05 to 0.5 hr , while the equal volume of the resulting culture is removed frcm the flask to concentrate and separate microbial cells which can quickly grow under such conditions. Then, the culture thus obtained i s spread on plates containing a medium having the same composition as that of the medium used in the continuous cultivation but containing about 0.1 to 5 of L aspart.ic acid and cultivated at 10 to 450C, preferably at 28 to 370C for 1 to 3 days. A large colony grown on the plates is isolated to give the desired microorganism having high aspartase activity such as 9 to 13 Amole min mg protein as measured by the method disclosed hereinafter and being released from catabolite repression. The representatives of the microorganism having high aspartase activity and being released from catabolite repression thus obtained are deposited with FermentationResearch Institute FRI , Agency of Industrial Science andTechnology, Ibaragi ken, Japan under Budapest Treaty onNovember 13, 1982. They are Serratia marcescens APc 109 FERM BP 391 and Serratia marcescens APc 494 FERM BP392 . Aspartase activities of these microorganisms are about 4 times as high as that of the parent strain or more.In addition, the microorganism of the present invention has such a characteristic that it has very high enzymatic activities responsible for tricarboxylic acid cycle TCA cycle such as citric acid synthase, ketoglutarate dehydrcgenase complex and fumarase activities as well as very high glutamate dehydrogenase and D serine deaminase activities in comparison with those of the parent strain. Since, as described in the above, aspartase activity of the microorganism of the present invention is extremely superior to that of the parent strain, L aspartic acid can be advantageously from fumaric acid. and ammonia by using the microorganism. That is, L aspartic acid can be produced by contacting a culture of the micrsorganism, microbial cells collected from the culture or a processed material of the microbial cells with the substrates, i.e., fumaric acid and ammonia to effect L aspartic acid producing enzymatic reaction. The microorganism of the present invention can be cultivated by using a conventional nutrient medium containing carbon sources e.g., glucose, sucrose, glycerol, fumaric acid , nitrogen sources e.g., ammonium fumarate, ammonium sulfate , orcanic nutrients e.g., yeast extract, peptone, corn steep liquor, meat extract , inorganic salts e.g., potassium dihydrogen phosphate, magnesium sulfate , and the like. The cultivation can be carried out according to a convesntional method. For example1 after adjusting pH of a medium to 5.0 to 9.0, the microorganism is inoculated into the medium and cultivated at 10 to 45 oC, preferably, at .8 to 370C for 12 to 92 hours under aerobic conditions.In the medium, L aspartic acid can be also used as a carbon source as well as a nitrogen source and the preferred amount thereof is about 0.1 to 5 . As described in the above, when ti aspartic acidproducing reaction is carried oat, not only the culture of the microorganism but also microbial cells collected from the culture and a processed material of the microbial cells can be used. The collection of the microbial cells from the culture can be carried out according to a conventional method such as filtration, centrifugation, and the like. Examples of the processed material of the microbial cells are washed microbial cells prepared by washing the microbial cells with physiological saline solution, phosphate buffer solution, carbonate buffer solution and the like dried microbial cells prepared by drying the microbial cells according to a conventional method such as lyophilization, acetone treatment and the like ground microbial cells prepared by grinding the microbial cells with glass beads, alumina and the like autolysates of the microbial cells prepared by toluene, chloroform and the like sonicates of the microbial cells prepared by sonic oscillator microbial cell extracts prepared by french press and immobilized preparations obtained by immobilizing the microbial cells or the above other processed materials thereof according to a known method such as gel conjugation method, adsorption method Dr the like. Examples of the immobilized preparations are those obtained by immobilizing the microbial cells or the above other processed materials thereof on supports, carriers or bases such as polyacrylamide gel, sulfur containing polysaccharide e.g., carrageenan, furcellaran, etc. gel, collagen gel, alginic acid gel, polyvinyl alcohol gel, agar gel and the like.When polyacrylamide gel is used, the immobilization can be carried out according to the method disclosed in JapanesePatent Publication No. 1831 1978. When sulfur containing polysaccharide gel is used, the method disclosed in JapanesePatent Laid Open PubLication No. 6483 1978 can be employed.Further, when collagen gel, alginic acid gel, polyvinyl alcohol gel, agar geL or the like is used, the immobilization can b carried out according to the methods disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid Open Publication Nos.144780 1976, 30582 1974, 80285 1974 and 133484 1976. Fumaric acid and ammonia to be used as the substrates can be introduced into a L aspartic acid producing enzymatic reaction system in various forms. For example, they can be introduced into the reaction system in the form of ammonium fumarate or as fumaric acid or its salt and an inorganic ammonium salt. As the salt of fumaric acid, for example, sodium fumarate or potassium fumarate can be suitably used. As the inorganic ammonium salt, for example, ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate or a mixture thereof can be suitably use. In case ot using fumaric acid or its salt and the inorganic ammonium salt, it is preferable that the molar ratio of these two components are within the range between 1 1.5 to 1 2. The enzymatic reaction can be carried out at such a wide temperature range as about 5 to 500C but, in view of stability of the enzyme of the microorganism, it is preferable that the enzymatic reaction is carried out at 20 to 450C. Further, it is preferable to carry out the enzymatic reaction at a pH range of 6 to 10. Besides, when the enzymatic reaction is carried out, it is preferable to add a divalent metal ion such as calcium ion, magnesium ion, manganese ion, strontium ion or the like to the reaction system. The amount of the divalent metal ion can be about 0.1 to 10 mM and thereby stability of the enzyme can be improved. When the microbial cells are used, preferably, the reaction is carried out in batchwise and T aspartic acid can be produced by suspending the microbial cells collected from the culture thereof in a solution of the above substrates and stirring the suspension. When the immobilized preparation is used, the reaction can be carried out not only by a batch process but also by a continuous process using a column packed with the immolxilized preparation since the immobilized preparation is insoluble in water. For example, the immobilized preparation is packed in a column and a substrate solution is passed down through the column at a suitable flow rate o obtain effluent containing only L aspartic acid. When the reaction is carried out by a batch process, L aspartic acid can be produced by suspending the immobilized preparation in a substrate solution and stirring the suspension. In the latter case, the immobilized preparation can be reused by separating it from the reaction mixture according to a standard method such as filtration or centrifugation. The progress of the above reaction is effected by the amount of microbial cells, temperature, reaction time, flow rate of the substrate particularly, linear velocity and the like.Optimal reaction conditions which can attain 100 progress of the reaction can be readily found, for example, by suitably adjusting the flow rate of a substrate solution passing down through a column according to the amount of an immobilized preparation, in case of a continuous process using a column, or by suitably adjusting a reaction time, in case of a batch process. L Aspartic acid thus produced and accumulated in the reaction mixture can be readily separated and purified according to known methods, for example, by combining a conventional method using an ion exchange resin with other known methods. As described hereinbefore, according to the present invention, the microorganism of the genus Serratia having extremely high aspartase activity in comparison with that of a known microorganism of the genus Serratia used in a conventional method for producing L aspartic acid can be obtained. Further, according to the present invention, L aspattic acid can be produced from fumaric acid and ammonia in a very high yield within a short period of time by using the microorganism of the genus Serratia having such a high aspartase activity. With respect to the increase in aspartase activity of the microorganism of the present invention, although any specific mechanism has not yet been clarified, it is assumed that a ene thereof responsible for the production of aspartase is probably mutated.In addition, the microorganism of the present invention have such a characteristic that its aspartase activity is not decreased even in the presence of a readily assimilable carbon source such as glucose since the microorganism is released from catabolite repression. In other words, the aspartase activity of the microorganism is scarcely effected by the kinds of carbon sources ts be used and the high aspartase activity is constantly revealed. Thereby, there is no need to pay attention to the kind of a carbon source used in the production of L aspartic acid. This is one of the preferable characteristics cf the present invention. Furthermore, in addition to the high aspartase activity, the microorganism of the present invention has such a characteristic that all cf the activities of the enzymes responsible for TCA cycle such as citric acid synthase, ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex and. fumarase as well as glutamate dehydrogencLse and D serine deaminase in the presence of glucose are als extremely increased. Such a microorganism as activities o all enzymes thereof being increased has r,ot hitherto been known in the prior art. The following examples further illustrate the present invention in detail but are not to be construed to limit the scope thereof. In the examples, asparta se activity was determined by contacting 1 M ammonium fumarate solution containing 1 mM magnesium chloride pH 8.7 with the microbial cells or the processed material thereof, incubating at 37C for 15 to 60 minutes to effect the enzymatic reaction, ancl measuringL aspartic acid in the resulting reaction mixture by bioassay using Leuconostoc mesenteroides P60 J. Biol.Chem., 172, 15 1948 1. D Serin deaminase activity was determined according to the method described in J. Biol.Chem., 241, 1239 1966 . Citric acid synthase activity was determined according to the method described in Methods inEnzymology, 13, 1969 . C Ketoglutarate dehfdrogenase activity was determined according to the method described inSeikagaku Jikken Koza, Vol. 12, p 196 1976 . Glutamate dehydrogenase activity was determined according to the method described in J. Microbiol., 64, 187 1970 . Further, fumarase activity was determined as follows 0.2 M Potassium fumarate 0.01 M potassium phosphate butter pH 7.0, 30 ml was added to an enzyme, microbial cells or a processed material of microbial cells and the mixture was reacted with shaking at 370C for 1 hour.Hydrochloric acid was added to the reaction mixture to remove unreacted fumaric acid. The amount cf L malic acid in the supernatant was colorimetrically determined by reacting it with 2,7 naphthalene diol to develop color. Example 1 Serratia marcescens SR41 was treated with Nmethyl N nitro N nitrosoguanidine according to d standard 10 method and 5 x 10 microbial cells thus treated were inoculated into a spinner flask volume 50 ml, manufactured by Belco Co., U.S.A. containing a medium 50 ml composed of glucose 3.0 , sodium L aspartate 0.015 , potassium dihydrogen phosphate 0.3 , diyzotassium hydrogen phosphate 0.7 and magnesium sulfate heptahydrate 0.01 . Then, a continuous cultivation was carried out at the degree of dilution of O.l hr at 300C for 8 days.The resulting culture was diluted 105 to 106 times with physiological saline and spreaded on plates containing a medium having the same composition as the above except that the concentration of sodium L aspartate was 0.5 and 1.5 of agar was added. After cultivation at 300C for 1 to 2 days, resulting large colonies were picked up to isolate Serratia marcescensAPc 494 FERM BP 392 . Aspartase activities and activities of the enzymes responsible for TCA cycle of the microorganism thus obtained and the parent strain were measured. The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

As is seen from Table 1, in comparison with the parent strain 8000, the aspartase activity of APc 494 strain is increased about 17 times in the presence of glucose and 5 times in the absence of glucose. In view of this, it is recognized that APc 494 strain is a mutant resulted from mutation of a gene responsible for the production of aspartase as well as release of catabolite repression.

Example 2 According to the same manner as described inExample 1, Serratia marcescens SR41 treated with Nmethyl N nitro N nitrosoguanidine was inoculated in a medium 50 ml composed of sodium L aspartate 0.1 , potassium dihydrogen phosphate 0.3 , dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 0.7 and magnesium sulfate heptahydrate 0.01 and continuously cultivated for 8 days.
