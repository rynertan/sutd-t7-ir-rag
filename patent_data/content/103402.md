## Description
APPARATUS FOR PLAYING A RECORD DISC This invention relates to apparatus for playing a record disc, most typically a gramophone record. Any record player requires that access is permitted to the turntable to enable the user to place a record centrally on the turntable using the spindle as a guide, and hitherto this has meant that in equipment known as a rack system and comprising a turntable, an associated amplifier and possibly a tuner and or cassette tape player, the turntable has always had to be located on the top of the system and has had to be provided with a removable or alternatively hinged lid.This has had various disadvantages first it has inhibited the designers freedom in designing as aesthetically pleasing system, secondly the lid gets in the user 5 way when placing a record on the turntable and if not hinged has to be put down somewhere while the record is placed in position, and thirdly the equipment cannot be. used when mounted in a shelving system without a very large space between the top of the equipment and the shelf above. It is known, for example, from British patent specifications nos. 488067, 644778 and 727458, to mount apparatus for playing a record disc on a tray or drawer which slides in a horizontal plane in and out of the cabinet in which the apparatus is housed. Although the arrangements described in these specifications avoid the need to provide sufficient space for a hinged lid to be opened, we have appreciated that they do have one major disadvantage. Because the drawers are intended to be slid in and out of the cabinet by hand, it is not possible to slide the drawer back into the cabinet once a record is playing as it is almost inevitable that the stylus of the pick up arm will be disturbed. Consequently, the record disc must, with all these arrangements, be played in a position in which the disc is exposed to the atmosphere and the dirt and dust it carries.It is with a view to avoiding this exposure to airborne dust that record playing apparatus is normally provided with a lid or cover. British patent application no. 2075242 describes apparatus in which the turntable is, in use, mounted on a motor driven plate which slides horizontally into and out of a front opening in the cabinet. Again, however, the apparatus is such that a record disc can only be played in a position in which a substantial part of the disc is outside the cabinet and exposed to the dust carrying atmosphere. It is also known, for example, from published European patent application no. 0040880, to provide apparatus for playing a record disc comprising a generally closed housing having an opening at one side a turntable assembly operable to play a record disc a carriage supporting the turntable assembly and slidable through the opening in the housing and drive means for driving the carriage between an inner position, in which the turntable assembly is fully received within the housing, and an outer position in which a record disc can be placed on the turntable. The apparatus described in application 0040880 is,however, provided with a conventional automatic pick up arm, mounted within the housing, which operates when the carriage is returned to the inner position. Although this arrangement has the advantge that the record disc is played within the cabinet, it is inconvenient to use because the automatic pick up arm will only position the stylus at the outermost edge of the disc and it is not, therefore, possible to select a particular portion of the disc at will or to resume playing after an interruption without beginning at the outermost edge again. The apparatus in accordance with the present invention is characterised in that the turntable assembly includes a pick up arm which is mounted on the carriag e and in that the turntable assembly is operable to play the record disc in all positions of the carriage. Thus, a disc may be placed on the turntable when it in the outer position, the pick up arm positioned on any selected portion of the disc and the drive means operated to return the carriage to its inner position within the cabinet while the disc is playing. The invention will be described in ore detail by way of example with reference to the drawings in which Figure 1 illustrates record playing apparatus in accordance with this invention embodied in a rack system counted in a shelving system Figure 2 is a front view of the record playing apparatus with part of the housing removed Figure 3 is a side view of the record playing apparatus with part of the housing removed Figure 4 is a view similar to Figure 2 with the tray in its outer position and with part broken away to show the drive train Figure 5 is a plan view showing the tray in its outer position and Figure 6 is a circuit diagram for the drive motor circuit. Figure 1 illustrates a rack system 10 mounted between two shelves 12, 14 of a shelving system. The rack system is seen to fit neatly between the two shelves. The rack system 10 includes a gramophone record player section 20, an amplifier section 26, a cassette decks section 22, and a radio tuner section 24. As is seen the record player section 20 is not the top section but as shown forms the bottom section of the system. The rack system 10 has a wooden housing 16 which is closed on the back, sides, top and bottom, and is also closed on the front except for the bottom record player section where the housing has an opening 18. There is a metal frame within the wooden housing.The record player section of course has a turntable 30 Figure 3 with a central spindle 32 over which a record is placed, and this turntable is mounted on a tray 34. A cut out 35 of required shape is formed in the tray to receive the turntable motor, etc.The tray 34 is of plastics material and is slidably mounted in the housing 16 for movement through the opening 18 in a plane which is parallel to the plane of the turntable 30, between an outer position shown in Figure 4 where the turntable lies outside the housing 16, and an inner position shown in Figure 3 where the turntable is fully received within the housing. When the tray is in the inner position the front portion of the tray closes the opening 18 in a manner to be described belt. The tray is moved by a reversible d.c. electric motor 36, mounted on the back edge 38 of the tray 34, and which drives a pinion 40 through a drive train 42 comprising a belt 44 and various reduction gears 46. To actuate the motor there is a switching system comprising a manually operable cross over switch 48 and two microswitches 50.The manual switch 48 is mounted on a pillar to the right of the opening 18. The microswitches are fixed on the base of the housing and are actuated by opposed si2es of a pillar 52 on the tray, The pillar 52 is mounted by a screw 54 as shown in Figure 5. The apparatus is thus arranged that the turntable can be driven forward by operation of the switch 48 to permit a record to be placed on the turntable. The record player can be started and the pick up arm placed by hand or automatically on the record, and the switch 48 operated again so as to return the tray 34 into the housing. The movement must be particularly smooth otherwise the pick up arm may be bounced out of the record grooves. This has been achieved in the illustrated example by a combination of measureS. First, as noted above, the pinion 40 is mounted centrally on the back edge of the tray 34, so as to pull evenly on the tray.The pinion engages a rack 56 which is formed on the side of a plastics moulding secured to the base of the housing. Formed integrally with the rack is a guide track 58 which receives two downwardly extending guide rollers 60 one to each side of the pinion 40. The gearing between the drive motor and the pinion is such that the tray moves at a speed of less than 2 cm s and preferably about 1 cm s. Each side of the tray is also guided by rollers. On each side the tray carries a track 62 and at the rear of the tray a roller 64. The sides of the housing each carry two rollers 66 near the front of the housing, for engaging in the track 62 on the tray, and a track 68 for receiving the roller 64 on the tray. The tracks are square channel section to provide two bearing surfaces for the associated rollers, though it will be appreciated that the rear roller 64 will tend to bear on the downwardly facing upper surface 70 of the track 68 and the rollers 66 will tend to bear on the downwardly facing upper surface 72 of the track 62. In this way the tray is maintained horizontal during its travel. The tray is so guided by two smaller guide rollers 74 mounted for rotation about vertical axes and positioned at the ends of the opening 18. these roilers stop .he tray skewing as it moves and assist in keeping it in line with the fore and aft direction. The front of the tray has a fixed front plate 76 covering the lower half of the opening 18 and a pivotal transparent cover member 80 which can lie behind the front plate 76, as shown in Figure 4, or can be raised, as shown in Figure 3, to cover the upper half of the opening 18. The cover member 80 has for this purpose two side arms 82 which are mounted in pivots 84. on the tray 34. The lower surfaces 86 of the arms 82 are shaped with a cam profile and engage with fixed cam followers 88 on the housing. Thus when the tray is in its outer position the cover falls to its lower position behind the front plate 76. As the tray is driven rearwardly by the motor the cam followers 88 engage the cam surfaces 86 and raise the cover gradually until with the frontplate 76 it completely closes the opening 18. The circuit for the motor 36 is shown in Figure 6. A d.c.supply is provided by a transformer 90 Figs. 4 and 5 and rectifier circuitry 92 of standard construction. This supply is connected through the cross over switch 48 so that one polarity is applied selectively to one pole of the motor and the other polarity is applied to the other pole in one case through the rear microswitch 50 and in the other case through the front micro switch 50. The microswitches are normally closed and open when the pillar 52 reaches them. To ensure that a user cannot inadvertently touch the electric parts a plastics profi e 94 is formed at the back of the tray 34.Also there is a cover plate not shown provided above the turntable within the housing to prohibit access to the circuitry in the sections above.
