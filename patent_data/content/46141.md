# Process for removing and recovering volatile organic substances from industrial waste gases.

## Abstract
A process for removing and recovering volatile organic substances from industrial waste gases by adsorption on to solid adsorbents 28, 29, 30 and description by hot inert gas circulating in a closed cycle, carried out continuously or intermittently. According to the new process, the volatile organic substances are recovered from the inert desorption gas partly by condensation by means of cooling 20 , and partly by readsorption 31, 32, 33 on to solid adsorbents.
