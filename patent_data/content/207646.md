# Dual ion beam deposition of dense films.

## Abstract
A novel dual ion beam sputtering process for depositing thin films of high density is described. One of the ion beams contains relatively heavy sputtering ions, such as argon ions, for ejecting atoms from a target. The second ion beam is also directed at the target and contains ions having energies of at least 3 electron volts and less than about 20 electron volts. The products of the beams are collected on a substrate as a thin film. High density, hydrogenated amorphous semiconductor films, oxide and nitride films, and other films, may be deposited according to the process. The films have densities nearly equal those observed for bulk samples of the same materials. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon films deposited by the process exhibit enhanced photoconductivity.

## Description
The technique of thin film deposition by ion beam sputtering is well established. In the typical process an ion beam of relatively heavy ions is directed at a target to cause ejection of atomic particles. These particles are collected on a substrate to form a film. In some variations of the technique, two ion beam sources are used usually a sputtering beam is directed at a target and the second beam is directed at the depositing film. For a general description of these techniques see Weissmantel, et al., Preparation of Hard Coatings by Ion Beam Methods, 63 Thin Film Solids, 315 325 1979 . In some methods, two relatively high energy ion beams, one containing noble gas ions and the other containing different types of ions, are directed at a target. The sputtered products are then collected on a substrate. See German Democratic Republic patent 149,549. An improved technique for dual beam deposition of thin films has recently been devised. In this technique, an ion beam composed of sputtering ions is directed at a target and a second ion beam composed of hydrogen or halogen ions is also directed at the target, rather than at the depositing film. When the target is silicon and the second beam is hydrogen ions, improved hydrogenated amorphous silicon films are prepared. See European patent application 0177115 published April 9, 1986. While the referenced techniques can provide electronic quality semiconductor films, it is also desirable to deposit high density films for use as diffusion masks in integrated circuit manufacture and for use as corrosion and wear resistant coatings on metals. Amorphous films of acceptable density for such applications are usually achieved only by high temperature post deposition treatments. The temperatures necessary to improve film density can have a detrimental effect on the substrate, particularly if the substrate is an integrated circuit. Accordingly, there is a need for a low temperature technique for depositing dense amorphous films. In the invention a novel dual ion beam process produces thin films, for example, amorphous hydrogenated silicon, silicon oxides, nitrides and other compounds, having densities very near the bulk values of the deposited materials, on substrates maintained at temperatures between 20C and 400C. In the novel process a beam of relatively heavy sputtering ions, such as argon ions, is directed at a target. A second beam of ions of relatively low energy is also directed at the target. These low energy ions, may be hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen or other ions and typically have energies less than about 20 electron volts, but not less than about 4 electron volts. The low energy ions combine with the target atoms or atoms sputtered from the target to form the deposition species either as atoms or molecules that are collected on a substrate. The deposition species impact the substrate with relatively low energy depositing a much denser film than otherwise observed in deposition by sputtering. In contrast to known dual ion beam processes, in the new process, the low arrival energy of the deposition species reduces structural disorder or defect formation in the deposited film producing the higher density. The resulting thin films show densities and dielectric constants at or very near the values usually measured only for bulk samples of the deposited materials. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon films deposited according to the process show increases in photoconductivity by about an order of magnitude or more over the best similar films deposited by previously known dual ion beam techniques. An arrangement of apparatus for carrying out the novel process is shown in Figure 1. A sputter target 1, which is gradually consumed in the sputtering process, is disposed opposite a substrate 3, on which the deposition species produced in the process are collected to form film. A beam 5 of relatively heavy sputtering ions is directed at target 1 from a conventional ion gun, not shown. The ion gun may be of the Kaufman type in which ions are formed in crossed electrical and magnetic fields. Electrons emitted from a central cathode follow spiral paths through the magnetic field toward a circumferential anode. The electrons form ions of gaseous atoms introduced into the gun between cathode and anode. The ions formed are accelerated out of the gun by an electrically charged accelerating grid. Just inside the gun from the accelerating grid is a screen grid maintained at a slightly different potential than the accelerating grid to protect the accelerating grid from ion impacts. Typically the sputtering ions are argon ions supplied to the beam source as argon gas. Other noble gases can be used as ion sources as well. The voltage applied to the ions in the sputtering beam source ranges from 750 to 1500 volts. A second beam 7 of low energy ions is directed at target 1 from a different direction. To achieve the best results, I prefer that the low energy ions have energies not greater than about 20 electron volts and no less than about 3 to 4 electron volts. A conventional Kaufman ion source cannot produce such low energy ions while sustaining a desired beam current. Therefore, I have found it necessary to modifiy a 2.5 cm. Kaufman source to produce ions with the desired energy at an acceptable beam current. In order to increase the current of the beam at low voltage, the screen grid is removed. As a result, the width of the dark space in the plasma within the Kaufman gun determines the beam current. The width of the dark space varies in a complex way with the absolute value of the anode voltage, permitting the beam current to be maintained at a desired level, although the voltage on the anode is reduced to produce ion energies between 3 and 20 electron volts. The ions in the second beam are also derived from a gas which may be elemental, such as hydrogen, oxygen or nitrogen, or a compound, such as silane and germane. In the arrangement of Figure 1, substrate 1 may be heated, for example, by an electrical current flowing through a substrate holder or by heat lamps to aid the deposition process. Typically, the range of substrate temperatures used in the novel process are 20C to 400C. The substrate may, for example, be glass, quartz, silicon, a metal or metal alloy. Typically, the vacuum in which the process is performed is maintained at about 0.13 to 1.33 x 10 Â³ pascal. In the arrangement of Fig. 1, the target may be silicon, germanium, molybdenum, nickel, etc. The ions in the low energy beam may be hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, etc. By choosing the proper combinations from these exemplary lists, films of silicon oxides, hydrogenated silicon, nitrides, germanium silicon alloys and other compounds and alloys can be produced. I have deposited numerous films of silicon oxides at room temperature by the novel process using argon ions as a sputtering beam, a silicon target and a low energy oxygen ion beam. Those oxide films have been analyzed by spectroscopic ellipsometry and show the same dielectric constant as does bulk silicon dioxide, even when the films are very thin. The same technique was used to measure the density of the films and demonstrated that the films had already reached their maximum density when only 2 nanometers thick. Using x ray spectroscopy techniques, it was determined that the film had a formula of SiO Many hydrogenated amorphous silicon films have been deposited by the new process using an argon beam, a silicon target and low energy hydrogen beam. These films not only have higher densities than other dual ion beam sputtered hydrogenated silicon films, but show substantially improved photoconductives. In Figure 2, the measured dark conductivity broken line and photoconductivity solid line are plotted for films deposited according to the new process and by a known dual ion beam process in which both beams are directed at the source. The latter process is disclosed in European patent application 0177115 published April 9, 1986. In that application, the hydrogen beam voltage employed was 100, 150 or 200 volts and the deposited films showed an optimized quality at a beam voltage of 150 volts. Those films showed maximum logarithmic dark conductivities and photoconductivities of 11 and 6.8 respectively. Films prepared according to that earlier disclosed process are shown in Figure 2 for hydrogen ion beam voltages of about 100 volts or more. Hydrogen beam voltage is plotted on the abscissa. Films of hydrogenated amorphous silicon prepared according to the novel process are shown in Figure 2 for the plotted data points corresponding to hydrogen beam voltages less than about 40 volts. The value of the logarithm of measured dark conductivity, the broken line, is keyed to the right ordinate and the value of the logarithm of measured photoconductivity, the solid line, is keyed to the left ordinate . As is apparent from the graph, both dark current and photoconductivity increase dramatically, more than an order of magnitude, when the hydrogen beam voltage drops below about 20 volts, i.e. when the energy of the ions is below 20 electron volts. The results plotted in Figure 2 were measured from films deposited on substrates at temperatures of 150C, with a sputtering beam of argon ions at 1000 volts and 30 milliampere current and a hydrogen beam current of 10 milliamperes. The amount of hydrogen incorporated in the films decreases sharply as the hydrogen beam voltage is reduced to the range of the novel process. See Figure 3. In order to optimize the improved results shown in Figure 2, I find it important to avoid contamination of the depositing films by heavy metal ions. While the arrangement of Figure 1 shows the sputtering and low energy ion beams striking only the target, in practice some of the ions in the beams miss the target and can strike the walls of the vacuum chamber in which the deposition takes place. Since the typical vacuum chamber may have a metal wall or base plate, the stray ions can sputter heavy metal ions into the chamber and onto the substrate. To avoid this source of contamination, I prefer to use a curtain of high purity silicon wafers to shroud the volume between the target and substrate. A hydrogenated silicon germanium alloy film may be deposited by using a silicon target and a low energy beam of ions formed from germane gas. The precise mechanism resulting in the deposition of the high density amorphous films is not known. In the typical sputtering process a growing film is constantly bombarded with sputtered atoms or electrons of relatively high energy. These atoms may well cause some sputtering or structural damage the depositing film, such as the creation of voids, reducing its density. In addition, some of the sputtering gas atoms may be incorporated in the depositing film. In the novel process the low energy ions interact with the target and or with atoms sputtered from the target to form the depositing species. The substrate is not bombarded with species having energies that may damage the film. In addition, the number of sputtering gas ions incorporated into films prepared according to the novel process is quite low. A typical secondary ion mass spectroscopy SIMS measurement of films deposited according to the invention shows about 10 Â³ percent of argon in a hydrogenated amorphous silicon film.
