# Synthetic diamond heat sink.

## Abstract
A synthetic diamond heat sink which can be easily shaped and which ensures a consistently high thermal conductivity in which the diamond is a Type lb diamond containing 5 to 100 ppm nitrogen. The synthetic diamond crystal has a shape approaching that of a hexahedron with a high proportion of 100 planes and is synthesized by heating a carbon source, a solvent and a diamond seed crystal in the stability region of diamond at a high pressure. The tempera ture gradient between the carbon source and the seed crystal is adjusted to cause diamond growth on the seed crystal. The solvent employed is selected from the group of cobalt, nickel, iron, chromium and manganese. The diamond crystal is caused to grow as the temperature of the solvent is radually decreased at a rate of 0.15 to 10 C per hour so that temperature of the area where growth occurs on the seed crystal is held constant within a range the lower limit of which is a temperature 20 C higher than the melting point of the solvent and carbon source system and the upper limit of which is a temperature 40 C higher than the lower limit.
