# Device for determining local absorption differences in an object.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a device for determining local absorption differences in a planar object section, comprising an X ray source 2 and an X ray detector 10 which is directed towards the X ray source and which comprises a number of plate shaped collimating elements 30 which are directed towards the X ray source. On the respective lines of projection of these collimating elements towards the source, there are arranged radiation absorbing elements 34 whose dimensions, measured in the direction of the X ray source, are smaller than those of the collimating elements and whose dimensions measured in a direction at right angles and in the sectional plane are larger than those of the collimating ele ments. Apparent variations in the sensitivity of the X ray detector due to a lateral shift of the X ray focus in the X ray source, are thus substantially mitigated.
