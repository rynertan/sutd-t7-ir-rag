# Deflection circuit for a cathode ray tube.

## Abstract
A deflection circuit having particular application to a flat calhode ray display tube in which a channel plate electron multiplier is disposed parallel to, and spaced from a cathodoluminescent screen and a low current, low voltage electron beam is scanned over the input side of the electron multiplier by means of a variable electrostatic field created between a planar array of substantially parallel elongate electrodes and the input side of the electron multiplier. In order to generate the variable electrostatic field a deflection circuit is provided having a plurality of ramp voltage generating stages, each stage being connected to a respec tive elongate electrode. The deflection circuit is operated in such a manner that the completion of the generation of a ramp voltage in one stage is used to trigger the next required stage.
