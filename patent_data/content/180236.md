In reference to Fig.1, one preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described. This figure shows a case in which a toilet bowl a , a toilet bowl urinal b and a hand washing bowl c are arranged in a unit room A . The unit room A is formed with an air passage A₄ communicating with the interior of its floor A₁ , interior of a side wall A₂ and interior of a ceiling A₃ , and a grating A₅ having several vent holes therein is arranged over an entire floor surface, and in turn an entire ceiling wall is provided with air filters A₆ . Interior air is forcedly circulated by a circulation blower A₇ arranged in the midway of the air passage A₄ , thereby clean and fresh air is always supplied through air filters A₆ and the atmosphere in the room is kept clean. Each air filter A₆ is a high grade filter which can collect dusts of ultra fine particles and its efficiency of collection is more than 99.7 . The toilet bowl a is provided with a water supplying part 1 for cleaning the interior of the toilet bowl a as shown in Figs.2 to 4, a local cleaning device 2 and local drying devices 3 constituting a local cleaning and drying device for use in cleaning a local part of a user and thereafter drying the local part, an air bleeding device 4 for discharging odor in the toilet bowl a and a control part 6 for receiving a sensing signal from a sensing part 5 for sensing a human body and a signal from an operating part 7 and for controlling each of the operations of the devices. The water supplying part 1 is made such that a water passage 1a communicating with a source of water is formed at an outer circumference of the toilet bowl a , a water supplying pipe 1b is connected to the water passage 1a , a solenoid valve 1c is arranged in the midway of the water supplying pipe 1b , the solenoid valve 1c is electrically connected to the control part 6 , the solenoid valve 1c is opened for a predetermined period of time under an instruction from the control part 6 , a cleaning water is supplied to the water passage 1a from the water supplying pipe 1b , the cleaning water is flowed along the inner wall of the toilet bowl a from several water flowing ports 1d opened at the bottom wall of the water passage 1a so as to clean the toilet bowl a . The water supplying pipe 1b and the solenoid valve 1c are placed out of the unit room A so as not to hinder the flow of the clean air in the unit room A and then they are connected to the source of water. Cleaning water from the water supplying part 1 and sewage in the toilet bowl a are discharged out of the unit room A through a drain trap 1a and a drain pipe 1f connected to the drain trap. The local cleaning device 2 is made such that a cleaning water injection nozzle 2a is arranged at the lower surface of a seat a1 , the nozzle 2a is connected to the source of hot cleaning water through the water supplying pipe 2b and the solenoid valve 2c , the solenoid valve 2c is electrically connected to the control part 6 , the solenoid valve 2c is opened under an instruction from the control part 6 , the cleaning water of desired temperature is supplied to the cleaning water injection nozzle 2a through the water supplying pipe 2b , the nozzle 2a injects the cleaning water toward the local part of the user so as to clean the local part. The cleaning water injection nozzle 2a can be extended out or retracted from an opening a2 of the seat a1 and it is set such that its projection amount in respect to the opening a2 is different in each of the anus cleaning and the cleaning with bidet, respectively. The water supplying pipe 2a and the solenoid valve 2c are out of the unit room A due to reasons similar to that found in case of the toilet bowl cleaning device. Local drying devices 3 are made such that hot air passages 3a are defined within the seat a1 , the passages 3a are connected to a hot air generating machine 3c through air feeding pipes 3b for guiding the passages out of the unit room A , and the hot air generating machine 3c is electrically connected to the control part 6 . The hot air generating machine 3c is operated under instructions from the control part 6 to feed the hot air to the hot air passages 3a , the hot air is injected toward the local part of the user from the injection ports 3d opened at the front end walls of the passages 3a so as to dry the local part of the user. The hot air generating machine 3c is placed out of the unit room A , and within the casing 32c to which the suction pipe 31c is connected are arranged in sequence a blower fan 33c , an air filter 34c having a high efficiency of collection and a ceramic heater 35c generating no oxides, and further the hot air generating machine has a less thermal loss and can supply clean hot air in such a way as the air does not pollute the interior of the unit room A . An air bleeding device 4 is made such that an air bleeding passage 4a is defined at an outer circumference of the seat al , the bleeding passage 4a is communicated with the forced discharging fan 4c through discharging pipes 4b for guiding the passages out of the unit room A , the bleeding fan 4c is electrically connected to the control part 6 , the forced discharging fan 4c is operated under the instructions from the control part 6 , odor in the toilet bowl a is suctioned from the suction port 4d opened to the bottom wall of the discharging passage 4a and then discharged out of the unit room A . A sensing part 5 is composed of a photoelectric sensor which is fixed at the rear upper position of the toilet bowl a at the rear wall A₈ of the unit room A and is electrically connected to the control part 6 . The sensor detects a human body during a use of the toilet bowl, sends a sensed signal to the control part 6 and verifies the control part 6 that a beginning of the use of the toilet bowl is found. The sensing part 5 is made such that as shown in Fig.5 a light emitting and receiving element 5a is inclined forwardly and downwardly, a sensing area is restricted near the toilet bowl a and an erroneous operation is prevented in such a case as, for example, other than the use of toilet bowl, i.e. a man merely passes by in front of the toilet bowl a , it may not detect the human body. The operating part 7 is used for making a manual change over operation between the local cleaning device 2 and the local drying devices 3 , wherein as shown in Fig.6, a photoelectri sensor 7a is assembled in the operating panel 7b and arranged at the side upper position of the toilet bowl a at the side wall A₂ of the unit room A . The operating part is electrically connected to the control part 6 and the photoelectrical sensor 7a detects the hands of the user during a change over operation and sends the sensed signal to the control part 6 . That is, every time the user places his hands in front of the photoelectrical sensor 7a , operations of the local cleaning device 2 and the local drying devices 3 are changed over among a local cleaning, cleaning with bidet, drying and stop. Operation of the operating part 7 is allowed only when the sensing part 5 is operated, operation other than use of toilet bowl sensed by the sensing part 5 is prohibited and the cleaning water is prevented from accidentally being injected at the cleaning water injection nozzle 2a in the local cleaning device 2 other than an occasion of use of the toilet bowl and further from being stained in the unit room A . Receiving of a signal sent from the operating part 7 to the control part 6 is cancelled in case that a signal output time is in a desired period of time, e.g. less than 0.5 second, subsequent signals are also cancelled in case that output interval of signals is less than a desired period of time, e.g. less than 1 second, and operations of the local cleaning device 2 and the local drying device 3 are not unnecessarily changed over. The operating panel 7b is provided with a display for indicating operating conditions of presence or absence of input of power supply and ranging from the cleaning to the stop and with light emitting diodes 7c near the display for indicating the operations. At a position near the operating panel 7b is arranged a water force adjusting operating panel 8 for use in adjusting the water force from the cleaning water injection nozzle 2a in the local cleaning device 2 . The operating panel 8 is provided with the water force adjusting switches 8a and 8b as shown in Fig.7. The switches 8a and 8b are a so called manual touch switch. These switches are relatively less frequently used and only a part of the finger tip is contacted with the switches, so a slight adhesion of hand stain may not generate any troubles at all. Operations of the toilet bowl a during its use described above are performed in reference to the time chart and the flow chart as shown in Figs.8 and 10. That is, the user sits on the seat a1 , the sensing part 5 detects the human body and the sensed signal is sent to the control part 6 . This sensed signal is cancelled within a desired time, e.g. within three seconds and useless operation of the water supplying part 1 , local cleaning device 2 and the local drying devices 3 are prevented. When the sensed signal is fed to the control part 6 more than three seconds, the solenoid valve 1c of the water supplying part 1 is opened and a preparatory cleaning of the toilet bowl a is carried out and at the same time the power supply for the operating part 7 is turned on. Further, when the sensing part 5 detects the human body and at the same time the forced discharging fan 4c for the air bleeding device 4 is operated and the discharging or bleeding of odor is started under a suction at the suction port 4d . The reason why the preparatory cleaning is performed consists in the fact that water film is formed at the inner wall surface of the toilet bowl a in advance and the stains after use of the toilet bowl may easily be removed. And the bleeding operation is continued during the use of toilet bowl in such a way as odor can be discharged without leaving it as well as for a desired period of time, for example, 15 seconds after the user moved away from the toilet bowl upon completion of the use of the toilet bowl, cleaning of the local part and drying of the local part and even after the output of the sensed signal of the sensing part 5 is stopped and after the output of the sensed signal is stopped. Upon completion of use of the toilet bowl, the user sets his hands in front of the photoelectrical sensor 7a at the operating part 7 to cause the sensor 7a to detect the hands, thereby the local cleaning device 2 starts to operate with the output of the first sensed signal and the cleaning of the local part is carried out with the cleaning water injected from the cleaning water injection nozzle 2a . After completion of the local cleaning operation, a second sensing signal is outputted at the photoelectrical sensor 7a at the operating part 7 again with a manual operation and a cleaning with bidet can be carried out. After washing with bidet or in case that the cleaning with bidet is not required, a third sensing signal is subsequently outputted at the photoelectrical sensor 7a of the operating part 7 , thereby the local drying devices 3 start to operate, hot air is blown from the blowing ports 3d and then the local part is dried. A ceramic heater 35c in the local drying devices 3 is started to heat when the sensing signal of the sensing part 5a is outputted, and a hot air is fed instantly by a blower fan 33c when the drying operation is started. A fourth sensing signal is outputted at the photoelectrical sensor 7a of the operating part 7 , thereby operation of the local drying devices 3 is stopped and the light emitting diode 7c for displaying a stopped condition in the operating panel 7b is illuminated for about one second. Further, upon completion of cleaning after use of the toilet bowl and drying of it in such a manner as described above, when the user moves away from the toilet bowl a , an input from the sensing part 5 to the control part 6 is stopped and the power supply for the operating part 7 is turned off and at the same time the solenoid valve 1c of the water supplying part 1 is opened again for a desired period of time under instructions from the control part 6 with a desired interval, for example, 2 seconds after the input of the signal is stopped, thus a major cleaning of the toilet bowl is carried out and the sewage is discharged out of the toilet bowl a . After the input of the sensed signal from the sensing part 5 is stopped and after a desired period of time, for example, 15 seconds is elapsed, operation of the bleeding device is stopped and all the operations are also stopped. In this way, under a condition in which all the operations are stopped, that is, at the time other than using of the toilet bowl, the power supply for the operating part 7 is kept turned off, so that the operating part 7 does not detect the human body so long as the sensing part 5 does not output any sensing signals, and it does not produce any outputs and thus it is possible to prevent any erroneous operations of the local cleaning device 2 and the local drying devices 3 . The local cleaning device 2 and the local drying devices 3 continue their operations within a desired period of time set by the control part 6 until the operating part 7 produces a new sensed signal, and stops automatically after the desired period of time is elapsed. The set time is set to, for example, 5 minutes in case of performing the local cleaning and the cleaning with bidet, and it is set to 10 minutes for example in case of performing the local drying operation. After the set time is elapsed, an alarm device will be operated after the local cleaning device 2 and the local drying devices 3 are stopped and will generate an alarm. Figs.11 and 12 illustrate another preferred embodiment of a toilet bowl a , wherein fixing frames 9 are integrally assembled and formed at the rear part of the toilet bowl a . Within the fixing frames 9 are fixed and arranged the water supplying part 1 , local cleaning device 2 , local drying devices 3 , functioning part of the discharging device 4 and the control part 6 . Cover panels 10 are fixed between the fixing frames 9 , thereby covers the functioning part of each of the devices and the control part 6 so as to make a unified assembly. The fixing frames 9 are assembled in a box like form higher than the toilet bowl a and the seat a1 , a sensing part 5 is fixed to the cover panel 10 covering the front surface and at the same time a cord 6a pulled out of the control part 6 can be connected to a power supply cord 6b arranged out of the cover panel 10 . The functioning part of the water supplying part 1 corresponds to the water supplying pipe 1b and the solenoid valve 1c , the base end of the water supplying part 1b is passed through the cover panel 10 and projected outward and further can be connected to a main water supplying pipe 1h through a connector 1g . The base end of the drain pipe 1f connected to the toilet bowl a is similarly passed through the cover panel 10 , projected outwardly and can be connected to the drain main pipe 1j through a connector 1i . The functioning part of the local cleaning device 2 corresponds to the water supplying pipe 2b and the solenoid valve 2c except the cleaning injection nozzle 2a and to a hot water heater 2d connected to the extremity end of the water supplying pipe 2b as shown in the drawings, the hot water heater 2d is mounted on and fixed to a mounting plate 2e arranged within the fixing frames 9 and at the same time connected to the midway part of the water supplying pipe 1b of the water supplying part 1 through a branch pipe 2f . The functioning part of the local drying devices 3 corresponds to the air blowing pipe 3b and the hot air generating machine 3c , the base end of the suction pipe 31c of the hot air generating machine 3c is passed through the cover panel 10 , projected outwardly and can be connected to the suction main pipe 3d . The functioning part of the bleeding device 4 corresponds to a bleeding pipe 4b and a forced bleeding fan 4c , the base end of the bleeding pipe 4b is passed through the cover panel 10 , projected outwardly and can be connected to the main bleeding pipe 4d . Therefore, the system shown in Figs.11 and 12 can be completed on site only by connecting a power supply code 6b , main water supplying pipe 1h , drain main pipe 1j , suction main pipe 3d and bleeding main pipe 4d . Since this system has no troublesome operation found in Figs.3 and 4 in which the functioning part of each of the devices and the control part 6 are separately arranged and thereafter they must be connected to each other, resulting in that their mounting work is quite simple and convenient. Then, a toilet bowl urinal b will be described as follows. As shown in Figs.13 to 15, the toilet bowl b is provided with a water supplying part 11 for cleaning the interior of the toilet bowl b and a control part 13 for receiving a sensed signal from a sensing part 12 sensing the human body and for controlling the operation of the water supplying part 11 . The water supplying part 11 has a water passage 11a along an entire circumference of the opening b1 , the water passage 11a is connected to a water supplying source through the water supplying pipe 11b extending out of the unit room A , a solenoid valve 11c is arranged in the water supplying pipe 11b , the solenoid valve 11c is electrically connected to the control part 13 , the solenoid valve 11c is opened under instructions from the control part 13 , the cleaning water is supplied from the water supplying pipe 11b to the water passage 11a . The cleaning water is flowed from several water flowing holes 11d opened at the bottom wall of the water passage 11a along the inner wall of the toilet bowl b so as to clean the interior of the toilet bowl b . The cleaning water and sewage from the water supplying part 11 are discharged out of the unit room A from the toilet bowl b through a drain trap 11e and a drain pipe 11f . The sensing part 12 is comprised of a photoelectric sensor, detects a human body standing in front of the toilet bowl b in case of using the toilet bowl, sends the sensed signal to the control part 13 , causes the control part 13 to acknowledge the starting of use of the toilet bowl, and the sensing part is fixed in flush with the upper front wall b2 of the toilet bowl b in such a way as it may not hinder the flow of clean air within the unit room A . A fixing structure for the sensing part 12 is constructed as shown in Fig.16, wherein the sensing part 12 is inserted and fixed to a front wall b2 of the toilet bowl b through a fixing hole b3 , a front end flange 12a of the sensing part 12 is abutted against an outer surface of the front wall b2 and in turn a fixing threaded shaft 12b at the rear end is fixed to the inner surface of the front wall b2 through bracket 12c and nut 12d . Operation of the toilet bowl b during sue of the toilet bowl b as described above is performed in reference to the time chart and the flow chart shown in Figs.17 and 18. That is, when the user stands in front of the toilet bowl b , the sensing part 12 detects the human body and sends the sensed signal to the control part 13 . This sensed signal will be cancelled in case that the output has a desired period of time, for example, within three seconds, and a useless operation of the water supplying part 11 will be prevented. When the sensed signal is inputted to the control part 13 more than three seconds, the solenoid valve 11c of the water supplying part 11 will be opened under the instructions from the control part 13 and then the cleaning of the toilet bowl b will be started before using of the toilet bowl. A duration of the solenoid valve 11c is one second, the solenoid valve 11c is closed after the time of opening of the valve is elapsed, the valve will be opened again after six seconds and periodical opening and closing operation of the solenoid valve 11c is repeated by several times within a period of using the toilet bowl. The valve opening time or valve closing time of the solenoid valve 11c is counted by a timer at the control part 13 and the solenoid valve 11c is opened or closed with a period of setting time at the control part. Thus, a proper amount of cleaning water is supplied into the toilet bowl b continuously from before starting of use of the toilet bowl to after completion of use of the toilet bowl under a periodical opening and closing operation of the solenoid valve 11c , a water film is always formed at the inner wall of the toilet bowl b , the bowl is cleaned without remaining any urine component and no odor may be produced. That is, even if the user moves away from a front part of the toilet bowl b upon completion of use of the bowl and input of the sensing signal from the sensing part 12 to the control part 13 is stopped, the cleaning water supplied under the opening of the solenoid valve 11c before its stoppage cleans the interior of the toilet bowl b . Figs.19 and 20 illustrate another preferred embodiment of the toilet bowl urinal b , wherein the fixing frames 14 are integrally assembled and formed at the rear part of the toilet bowl b , the functioning part of the water supplying part 11 and the control part 13 are fixed and arranged in the fixing frames 14 , cover panels 15 are fixed between the fixing frames 14 so as to cover the functioning part of the water supplying part 11 and the control part 13 to make a unified assembly. The fixing frames 14 are assembled to form a box like shape slightly higher than the height of the toilet bowl b and a code 13a0 pulled out of the control part 13 can be connected to a power supply code 13b arranged outside of the cover panel 15 . The functioning part of the water supplying part 11 corresponds to a water supplying part 11b and a solenoid valve 11c , a base end of the water supplying pipe 11b is passed through the cover panel 15 , projected outwardly and can be connected to a main water supplying pipe 11h through a connector 11g . The base end of the drain pipe 11f connected to the toilet bowl b is passed through the cover panel 15 in the same manner as that of the water supplying pipe 11b , projected outwardly and can be connected through a main drain pipe 11j . Therefore, the system shown in Figs.19 and 20 is completed in its work on site merely by connecting the power supply code 13a , water supplying main pipe 11h and the drain main pipe 11j and this system may eliminate a troublesome work such as a separate mounting of the functioning part of the water supplying part 11 and the control part 13 and then a connection of these elements as found in Figs.13 to 15, resulting in that an installing work becomes simple and a convenient work is assured. A hand washing bowl c0 will be described. Figure 21 . The hand washing bowl c is supported by a mounting block c placed out of the unit room A , only its front opening part c1 and a front wall c2 around the opening are adjacent to the interior of the unit room A from the rear wall A₈ . The hand washing bowl c is provided with a hand washing water injection device 21 constituting a water supplying part, a bowl cleaning device 22 , a hot air heater 23 for drying hands, air bleeding device 24 in the bowl c and a control part 26 for controlling an operation of each of the devices by receiving a sensed singal from a sensing part 25 for sensing the hands when the hands are washed. Each of the devices and the control part 26 are arranged within the hand cleaning bowl c or out of the unit room A so as not to prevent a flow of clean air in the unit room A . The hand washing water injection device 21 is arranged such that the water injection nozzle 21a is displaced from an intermediate position of a width direction outwardly on the upper wall surface c4 of the bowl part c3 in the hand washing bowl c and is fixed to face downward. The nozzle 21a is connected to a water supplying source through the water supplying pipe 21b having a solenoid valve 21c therein, the solenoid valve 21c is electrically connected to the control part 26 , the solenoid valve 21c is opened for a specified period of time under the instructions from the control part 26 to supply the cleaning water to the injection nozzle 21a and the nozzle 21a injects the hand washing water into the bowl c3 . The injection nozzle 21a is inclined by a desired angle toward a vertical line passing through an intermediate position in a width direction of the hand washing bowl c . The bowl cleaning device 22 has an annular water passage 22a at the upper circumferential part of the bowl c3 , the water passage 22a is connected to the water supplying source through a water supplying pipe 22b provided with the solenoid valve 22c . The solenoid valve 22c is electrically connected to the control part 26 , the solenoid valve 22c is opened under instructions from the control part 26 , the cleaning water is supplied to the water passage 22a , is flowed from several water flowing holes 22d opened at the bottom wall of the water passage 22a along the inner wall of the bowl c3 so as to clean the interior of the bowl c3 . The cleaning water from the bowl cleaning device 22 is discharged out of the hand washing bowl c and unit room A together with the cleaning water from the hand washing water injection device through a drain trap 22e and a drain pipe 22f . A hot air heater 23 is provided with a hot air injection nozzle 23a at the upper wall surface c4 of the bowl part c3 at a position in its width direction which is symmetrical to the injection nozzle 21a . The nozzle 23a is connected to the hot air generating machine 23c through a flexible pipe 23b , the hot air generating machine 23c is electrically connected to the control part 26 . The hot air generating machine 23c is operated for a desired period of time under instructions from the control part 26 to send the hot air to the injection nozzle 23a and then the hands are dried by hot air blown from the nozzle 23a . The injection nozzle 23a is inclined at the same angle as that of the water injection nozzle 21a toward the vertical line passing through an intermediate position in a width direction of the hand washing bowl c . Therefore, putting the hands at the intermediate position in a width direction in the hand washing bowl c causes both cleaning water from the water injection nozzle 21a and hot air from the injection nozzle 23a to be applied to the hands without moving them. The hot air generating machine 23c is made such that a blower fan 233c , air filter 234c and ceramic heater 235c are arranged in sequence from the upstream side within a casing 232c to which a suction pipe 231c is connected. A thermal loss is less and a clean hot air can be fed in such a way as the clean air in the unit room A is not polluted. The air bleeding device 24 in the bowl c3 is placed adjacent to the rear part of the bowl c3 to form air bleeding passage 24a , the air bleeding passage 24a is connected to a forced air bleeding fan 24c through an air bleeding pipe 24b and at the same time the air bleeding fan 24c is electrically connected to the control part 26 , the forced air bleeding fan 24c is operated for a specified period of time under instructions from the control part 26 to suck dusts such as effete matter of hands dropped into the bowl c3 under chafing of hands during drying of hands from the air bleeding passage 24a together with hot air and then discharge them. The sensing part 23 is comprised of a photoelectric sensor which is arranged at a position in the upper wall surface c4 of the bowl held between the water injection nozzle 21a and the blowing nozzle 23a , that is, an intermediate position in a width direction of the hand cleaning bowl c , and as shown in Fig.21, an optical axis ℓ₁ of light emitting and light receiving element is inclined downward and forward by a desired angle in respect to a vertical line. The inclination of the optical axis ℓ₁ is made in order to enable the sensing part 25 to positioned slightly deeper from the opening c5 of the hand washing bowl c , to prevent any erroneous operation of the sensing part 25 caused by an accidental cutting of the light beam emitted from the light emitting element with hands and to enable a rapid sensing of hands to be performed when the hands are put into the hand washing bowl c through the opening c5 in case of washing hands. Operation of each of the devices in the hand washing bowl c is automatically controlled by the control part 26 received the sensed signal from the sensing part 25 . In order to perform both hand washing and drying operations for a desired period of time, it is necessary to make a manual control over the operation of each of the devices and so in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the manual control is performed by a switch operation at the operating panel 27 . The operating panel 27 is arranged at the side position of the hand washing bowl c at the rear wall A₈ of the unit room A . The operating panel 27 is provided with a hand washing switch 27a and a drying switch 27b of push button type, light emitting diodes 27c , 27d indicating the input condition of the switches, as shown in Fig.23, and similarly it is provided with a stop switch 27e of a push button type switch and with light emitting diodes 27f0, 27g for displaying either an automatic control or a manual control and for indicating its operation, and further it is electrically connected to the control part 26 . Operation of the hand washing bowl c during hand washing is performed in reference to the time chart and the flow chart shown in Figs.24 to 27. At first, in case of an automatic control operation, when the user puts his hands into the hand washing bowl c , the sensing part 25 detects the hands and sends the sensed signal to the control part 26 . Input of a sensing signal to the control part 26 is only first time of inputting operation and the sensed signals outputted subsequent to the first input time are prohibited from being input to the control part 26 . When a sensed signal is inputted to the control part 26 , the solenoid valve 21c for the hand washing water injection device 21 is opened for a desired period of time, for example, 10 seconds, under instructions from the control part 26 and the cleaning water for washing hands is injected from the water injection nozzle 21a . The solenoid valve 22c for the bowl cleaning device 22 is opened in simultaneous with the injection of the cleaning water from the water injection nozzle 21a and then the cleaning in the bowl c is started. Time of opening of the solenoid valve 22c is for one second, the solenoid valve 22c is closed after this valve opening time is elapsed and then the valve is opened again after six seconds. Such a periodic opening and closing of the solenoid valve 22c is repeated by several times within a hand washing time. Valve opening and closing time of the solenoid valve 22c is counted by a timer at the control part 26 and the solenoid valve 22c is opened or closed at a period of specified time at the control part 26 . Thus, a proper amount of cleaning water is supplied continuously into the bowl c3 of hand washing bowl c until completion of hand washing action under a periodical opening and closing operation of the solenoid valve 22c , and the sewage generated after hand washing action is discharged out of the hand washing bowl c and out of unit room A without being remained in the bowl c . After the hand washing and cleaning of the bowl c3 are carried out, the hot air generating device 23 and air bleeding device 24 simultaneously start their operation after a desired time, for example, 5 seconds is elapsed and then the hand drying and the air bleeding of the bowl part c3 are carried out. The reason why a delay time is made between a starting of operation of the hot air heater 23 and the air bleeding device 24 and a stoppage of operation of the hand washing water injection device 21 and the bowl cleaning device 22 consists in that the cleaning water or sewage remained in the bowl part c3 is prevented from being splashed out of the bowl part c3 with hot air produced from the hot air heater 23 and the air bleeding device may not badly affected under a suction of the cleaning water into the air bleeding device. The hot air heater 23 is operated such that air is heated during its passage through the ceramic heater 235c under a rotation of the blower fan 233c in the hot air generating machine 23c , the hot air is blown from the blowing nozzle 23a , struck against the hands to dry them. The ceramic heater 235c is already started to heat when the sensed signal is inputted to the control part 26 and the hot air may instantly be fed by the blower fan 233c when the drying operation is started. The air bleeding device 24 is operated such that the bowl part c3 is suctioned through the air bleeding passage 24a under a rotation of the forced air bleeding fan 24c , an operating time of the fan 24c is counted by a timer at the control part 26 , the fan 24c is operated within a specified period of time at the control part 26 and then its operation is stopped after the desired delay time, for example, 5 seconds is elapsed after the operation of the hot air generating device 23 is stopped. The reason why this delay time is made consists in the fact that dusts such as waste matters produced by scrubbing of hands after drying of hands is discharged out of the bowl part c3 without being remained in it. In case that the automatic control is changed over to a manual control, the stop pushbutton switch 27e at the operating panel 27 is depressed and the operation performed under an automatic control is stopped and reset to its initial condition, and thereafter either the hand washing switch 27a or the drying switch 27b is depressed to change over the automatic control to the manual control. Even if both the hand washing switch 27a and the drying switch 27a are depressed during the automatic control operation, its input is not received at the control part 26 . In case that the hand washing switch 27a is depressed, both hand washing water injection device and 21 and bowl cleaning device 22 are simultaneously started to operate in the same manner as that of the automatic control so as to perform both cleaning of hands and bowl part c3 . In order to stop the water injection of cleaning water after the hand cleaning is performed for a specified period of time, either the stop switch 27a or the drying switch 27b is depressed. In case that the drying switch 27b is depressed, the hot air heater 23 and the air bleeding device 24 are started to operate with a delay of desired time in the same manner as that of the automatic control after the injection of cleaning water is stopped, a change over from the hand washing operation to the drying operation is performed. In turn, in case that the drying switch 27b is depressed, the hands can be dried for a desired period of time under an operation of the hot air heater 23 in the same manner as above. In order to stop the drying operation, either the stop switch 27e or the hand washing switch 27a is depressed, and in case of depressing of the hand washing switch 27a , the operation is changed over to the hand cleaning operation with a delay time in the same manner as that of the automatic control. System shown in Figs.28 and 29 illustrates another preferred embodiment of the hand washing bowl c respectively. The system shown in Fig.28 is made such that fixing frames 28 are integrally assembled and formed from the bottom part of the hand washing bowl c to the upper part thereof through a rear part, and the cleaning water injection device 21 , bowl cleaning device 22 , hot air heater 23 , the functioning part of air bleeding device 24 and the control part 26 are fixed and arranged in the fixing frames 28 , and at the same time a cover panel 29 is fixed over the fixing frames 28 , thereby it covers the functioning part of each of the devices and the control part to make a unified device. The fixing frames 28 are comprised of a mounting block 28a and a frame 28b formed in a longitudinal box like shape and faced upwardly from the mounting block 28a , the hand washing bowl c is mounted and fixed on the mounting block 28a , a front opening c1 of the hand washing bowl c and a front wall c2 around the opening are projected out of the cover panel 29 and at the same time a cord 26a pulled out of the control part 26 can be connected to a power supply cord 26b arranged outside of the cover panel 26b . The functioning part of the cleaning water injection device 21 corresponds to the water supplying pipe 21b and the solenoid valve 21c except the water injection nozzle 21a , a base end of the water supplying pipe 21b is passed through the cover panel 29 , projected outwardly and can be connected to the main water supplying pipe 21e through a connector 21d . The functioning part of the bowl cleaning device 22 corresponds to the water supplying pipe 22b and the solenoid valve 22c , and a base end of the water supplying pipe 22b is connected to the midway part of the water supplying pipe 21b of the toilet cleaning water injection device 21 through a branch pipe 22b , thereby cleaning water is supplied. A base end of the drain pipe 22f to be connected to the hand washing bowl c is also passed through the cover panel 29 in the same manner as that of the water supplying pipe 21b , projected outwardly and can be connected to the main drain pipe 22i through a connector 22h . The functioning part of the hot air heater 23 corresponds to a flexible pipe 23b and a hot air generating machine 23c except a blowing nozzle 23a , and the hot air generating machine 23c is mounted and fixed on a mounting plate 32d arranged in the fixing frames 28 . The functioning part of the air bleeding device 24 corresponds to a air bleeding pipe 24b and a forced air bleeding fan 24c , a base end of the air bleeding pipe 24b is passed through the cover panel 29 , projected outwardly and can be connected to the main air bleeding pipe 24d . Therefore, system shown in Fig.28 is completed in its work on site by a mere connection of a power supply code 26b , a main water supplying pipe 21e , a main drain pipe 22i and a main air bleeding pipe 24d and it does not require any troublesome operation in which the functioning part of each of the devices and the control part 26 are separately mounted and then they must be connected to each other as shown in Figs.21 and 22, resulting in that a mounting work becomes simple and convenient. In turn, a system shown in Fig.29 is made such that an hot air generating machine 23c of a hot air heater 23 and an air bleeding passage 24a0 formed adjacent to the rear part of the bowl part c3 are connected by a suction and air bleeding pipe 23e . The air fed through the suction and air bleeding pipe 23e from within the bowl part c3 under a rotation of the blower fan 233c of the hot air generating machine 23c is heated while it is passed through the ceramic heater 235c , and then the hot air is blown from the blowing nozzle 23a to dry the hands and at the same time dusts such as waste matters generated under a scrubbing of both hands while drying operation is suctioned and then the waste matters are removed while they are passed through the air filter 234c , and they are circulated. Operation of the automatic control in case of hand washing at the hand washing bowl c shown in Fig.29 is carried out in reference to the time chart and the flow chart of Figs.30 and 31, wherein in case of performing a manual control, the operation is performed in reference to the time chart and the flow chart of Figs.32 and 33. Therefore, the system shown in Fig.29 can be installed more easily than that of Fig.28 due to the fact that the air bleeding device and the main air bleeding pipe are not required to have a connection on site. Further, although the present preferred embodiments show that the toilet bowls a and b and the hand washing bowl c are installed in the unit room A , it is not necessarily required to install three units a , b and c and for example, two units of toilet bowls a and b or two units of toilet bowl b and the hand washing bowl c may be installed.
