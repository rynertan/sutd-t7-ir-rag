# Surgical gown.

## Abstract
A surgical gown is disclosed in which the main body of the gown is fan folded around transversely extending fold lines. The sleeves 13 of the gown are inserted between the lower most fold or bottom fold 21 in the gown and the next adjacent fold. The donning of the gown forces the lowermost fold away from the remainder of the gown eliminating any problem of blocking of the gown.
