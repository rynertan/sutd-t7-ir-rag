# Tool changer assembly.

## Abstract
A tool changing mechanism or assembly 12 for a machine tool 14 , which has a spindle 15 for rotating a tool 13 on an operating axis and has a tool storage magazine 21 having at least one tool receiving means such as a socket 22 for supporting a tool on a storage axis, has an improvement which enables increased distances between the spindle and the storage axis. The improvement is that a tool changing arm 27 is mounted on a housing or a shuttle 23 to rotate about a first axis and the shuttle 23 is mounted on the frame 24 of the machine tool 14 so that it can be moved between two linear positions as the arm 27 is rotated so that the axis of rotation of the arm 27 is shifted in a linear path. Preferably, the arm 27 in addition to rotating about a first axis is rotated about a second axis which extends along or parallel to the length of the arm 27 so that the tool may be turned end for end as it is being transferred and the means 25, 26 for shifting the shuttle 23 is driven by the same actuator 49 that rotates the arm 27 so that movement of the arm 27 and shuttle 23 are synchronized. In the preferred embodiment, intermittent motion of the shuttle 23 is obtained by using an intermittent motion mechanism.
