# Measuring system based on the triangulation principle for the dimensional inspection of an object.

## Abstract
An apparatus for the rapid and accurate dimensional inspection of an object. In particular, the apparatus is adapted for the acquisition of object range data. The apparatus includes a source for emitting a slender beam of radiation, first beam guide means 2 for causing the beam to impinge on a desired spot P of the object under inspection, second beam guide means 4,5 for causing radiation reflected from the spot of impingement on a linear radiation sensitive detector 6,7 A preferred embodiment includes third beam guide means for causing radiation reflected from the spot of impingement to traverse a further path also leading to the detector. The second and third beam guide means are structurally different from each other in such a manner that one and the same object spot irradiated by the beam portion is imaged on the detector as two separate, focussed spots space fixed distance from each other. Thereby a reliable discrimi nation can be made between true and false reflections from the object under inspection.
