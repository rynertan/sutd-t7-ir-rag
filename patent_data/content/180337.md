# BUFFER CIRCUIT

## Abstract
An integrated circuit unity gain buffer amplifier suitable for low voltage operation, in which the input signal is applied to the base of a common emitter NPN transistor first stage Q1 . The collector of the first stage is connected to the base of an emitter follower NPN transistor second stage Q2 . The emitter of the second stage is connected to the base of an emitter follower PNP transistor third stage Q3 . The collector of the first stage is loaded by a constant current source 4 and its emitter is con nected through a resistance R1 to ground. The collector and emitter of the second and third stages respectively are con nected together through a resistor R3 to the supply voltage Vcc . The emitter of the second stage is connected through a resistance R2 to ground. The collector of the third stage is connected both to the output terminal 6 and to the emitter of the first stage. This allows the circuit to operate at a very low supply voltage without any transistor operating in practical saturation.
