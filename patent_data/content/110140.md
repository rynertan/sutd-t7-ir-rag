# Method and apparatus for forming an optical connector.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for forming miniaturized opti cal components such as fiber optics connector terminals in which a three part mold set is employed to attain precise concentricity of mold cavity formations carried by two of the three mold parts which are movable axially relative to and positioned by the third or central one of the three parts. The two movableparts are each located by oppositely diverging frustoconical reference surfaces on the central part and include mold surface components which are axially posi tionable relative to the parts in which they are carried. The central part is supported by a shuttle for movement between a molding position and an ejection position, appropriate ejection pins being located in spaced relation to the molding position so as not to interfere with the molding operation. Precise concentricity and axial location of the three mold parts is effected in substantial measure by application of a mold closing force exclusively along the common axis of the three parts and under a force limited to a pre established value.
