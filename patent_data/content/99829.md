# Fuel metering apparatus.

## Abstract
A fuel air ratio control apparatus for a reciprocating engine used in light aircraft including a fuel metering apparatus 32 and an electronic fuel air ratio control 39 . The control 39 generates an electrical signal Wf Wa indicative of a desired fuel air ratio based upon the flight condition of the aircraft and the metering apparatus 32 meters fuel flow Wf according to the mass airflow Wa ingested by the engine. The fuel metering apparatus 32 positions a metering valve 348 by means of a force balance of opposing forces developed by an air diaphragm 330 and a fuel diaphragm 335 . The fuel diaphragm 336 is subjected to the differential pressure of a metering head pressure Pu and a fuel output pressure Pm . The output pressure Pm is regulated by a controlled orifice 343 influenced by a proportional solenoid 406 whose armature valve 341 is positioned by the electrical signal Wf Wa .
