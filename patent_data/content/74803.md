# Clad metal joint closure.

## Abstract
A plasma arc spray overlay of cladding metals is used over joints between clad metal pieces to provide a con tinuous cladding metal surface. The technique permits applying an overlay of a high melting point cladding metal to a cladding metal surface without excessive heating of the backing metal.
