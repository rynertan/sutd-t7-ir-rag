# Reinforced material incorporating fine composite powder and method and apparatus for making the same.

## Abstract
A composite material made of a matrix of a first metal and reinforcing first particles with average particle diameter less than or equal to about ten microns dispersed in the first metal matrix, with the reinforcing first particles each having a composite structure, being made up of a plurality of fine second particles of a ceramic made by reacting together a second metal and a gas and being combined with one another by a matrix of a third metal. This composite material is made by vaporizing the second metal 7 , mixing the vapor with the gas, expanding the mixture through a nozzle means 23 for providing adiabatic expansion cooling under reaction between the second metal and the gas to provide the fine second particles of ceramic, producing vapor of the third metal 31 and mixing it in with the fine second parti cles at the downstream of the first nozzle means, directing the resulting mixture through a second expansion nozzle means 26 to form the first particles of composite structure, and directing an output flow from the second nozzle means into a bath of the first metal 60 to amalgamate the first particles with the matrix of first metal.
