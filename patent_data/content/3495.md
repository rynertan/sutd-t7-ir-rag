# A device for the diffusion of substances between two fluids separated by a semipermeable membrane.

## Abstract
A device for diffusion of substances between two fluids A, B separated by a semipermeable membrane 2 , preferably oxygenator, by which a first fluid A , for example oxygen, is conducted along the one surface of the membrane 2 with diffusion of one or several substances from this fluid A through the membrane 2 to the other fluid B , which is conducted on the opposite side of the membrane. The first mentioned fluid A is thereafter mixed direct into the other fluid B .
