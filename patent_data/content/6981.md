# A rapid clamping device for variable cutting tips.

## Abstract
A holder for the assembly of a conventional flame cutting torch tip 14 which provides release of the tip, and can include water cooling 42 44 of the tip during machine cutting opera tions. Although such tips often become fouled, the prior art has not provided sufficiently quick release for replacement purposes. The tip is held in abutment against the torch by a plurality of cam 48 actuated clamping followers 56 which wedge against the shoulder 68 of the conventional flame cutting tip when the holder is in a clamping position. The cam is operated by rotating a spring biased 26 actuating member, preferably a circumferential ring 22 , the ring being rotatable between a clamping position and a releasing posi tion, and normally being biased by said spring into the clamp ing position.
