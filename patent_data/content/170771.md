# A shock absorber for use with drilling tools.

## Abstract
A well tool 11 carried in a drill string for maintaining bottom hole contact while absorbing angular and axial shock forces of a rotating drill bit comprises a tubular man drel 17 slidably mounted within a tubular barrel 18 . A groove 47 and a roller 56 connection guides the mandrel within the barrel during drilling. Resilient shock absorbing members 66 are carried between stop elements on the mandrel and barrel. Shock forces are absorbed by the tele scoping movements of the mandrel within the barrel. The mandrel is formed of two pieces that threadedly connect to one another between the resilient shock absorbing mem bers 66 and the groove and roller connection.
