# A device for compacting powder.

## Abstract
A compaction device for compacting powder in which a compaction chamber 16 is formed by a block 1 having a conical bore 9 and a conical sleeve 2 being movable in the bore to be compressed thereby. The taper of sleeve 2 is somewhat smaller than that of the bore 9 . A combined shock absorber and extractor, for the compacted powder, which comprises a movable support 4 extending into the compac tion chamber 16 and being provided with an enlarged head portion 13 having passages 14 . An accumulator 42 is connected to a chamber 22 of the cylinder 11 in which support 4 is movable. The accumulator 42 improves the shock absorbing characteristics.
