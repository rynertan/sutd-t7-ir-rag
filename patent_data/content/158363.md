# Programmable array.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a thin film photoprogrammable mem ory array with a substantially increased resistance associated with each cell of the array. First and second sets of ortho gonally oriented address lines are formed on a substrate with the first set of address lines crossing the second set of ad dress lines at insulated cross overs. A plurality of amorphous silicon diodes are deposited on the members of the first set of address lines adjacent the insulated cross over points. Settable memory material, an optically programmable chal cogenide, is deposited in electrical contact with each of the amorphous silicon diodes and in electrical contact with a member of the second set of address lines adjacent the cross over region. When the settable memory material has been set to its high conductivity state, the electrical resistance be tween the amorphous silicon diode and the adjacent member of the second set of address lines is proportional to an ef fective electrical length measured along the settable storage member. A method of making the improved array is also disclosed. In a preferred embodiment the array is made on flexible substrate made of a synthetic polymeric resin.
