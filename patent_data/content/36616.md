# Method for producing fire resistant thermally insulating board.

## Abstract
A method for producing a fire resistant, thermally insulating board, which comprises applying liquid hy drated sodium silicate B onto the inner surface of a facing material or sheet A , spreading powdery hydrated sodium silicate C over the said applied surface, laying the said spread surface on 1 a facing material or sheet D , 2 a facing material or sheet D applied in advance with liquid hydrated sodium silicate B or 3 a facing material or sheet having powdery hydrated sodium silicate C spread further over the applied surface of 2 , implementing the heating and pressing procedure for gluing the assembly, and laminating the resulting fire resistant board E with rigid isocyanurate foam F . The fire resistant, thermaliy insulating board shows reduced fusing and combustion of the rigid isocyanurate foam F even when exposed to flame and possesses superior mechanical properties.
