## Description
PRODUCTION OF MICROBIAL CELLULOSE This invention relates generally to the production of microbial cellulose. Heretofore, standing cultures of cellulose producing microorganisms have been used to produce cellulose at the liquid air interface of such cultures. While the biosynthetic mechanism of microbial cellulose synthesis is incompletely understood, it does appear to have a high demand for oxygen. A standing culture of such microorganisms in a gas impermeable vessel produces a planar cellulosic film or pellicle in the liquid near where that liquid abuts the air. The structure of microbial cellulose membranes has been studied by Purz et al Faserforshung und Textiltechnik 28 4 pp. 155 163, 1977 and 27 11 pp. 561 570, 1976 and determined to be an interwoven and disordered mesh of fibrillar strands with diameters of 50 nm to 100 nm. Acetobacter xylinum pellicle has apparently been utilized to produce edible gelatinous cubes under the nameNata De Coco by Orientex Merchandising of the ELilippines. According to Bergey s Manual of Systematic Bacteri ologt Vol. 1, ed. N.R. Krieg pp. 268 274, Williams andWilkins, Baltimore, Md. 1984 cellulose synthesizing Acetobacter strains which were formerly classified asAcetobacter aceti, subspecies xylinum are now classified as subspecies of Acetobacter pasteurianus and Acetobacter hansenii. The Bergey reference cited above also refers to studies indicating that static culture favors cellulose synthesizing cells while shake cultures favor cellulosefree mutant cells. The present invention comprises a process for microbial cellulose production. Both a liquid culture comprising a cellulose producing microorganism and a structure having a first side and a second side and comprising material permeable to gases are provided. The first side of the structure is contacted with an oxygen containing gas. The second side of the structure is contacted with the liquid culture so that microbial cellulose is produced thereon. The structure may be a shaped mold or cast or may supply oxygen containing gas to a continually nutrient supplemented culture. Cellulose producing microorganisms useful in the present invention include members of the Acetobacter,Rhizobium, Agrobacterium and Pseudomonas genera Brown et al. J. Applied Polymer Science Appl. Polymer Symp. 1983 37 33 78 . The growth of such cellulose producing microorganisms with microbial cellulose productions occurs generally in a suitable nutrient medium having a pH between about 3.5 and about 5.5 when incubated under aerobic conditions and at temperatures between about 200C and about 300C. A use of Acetobacter xylinum to coat synthetic fibers with microbial cellulose is disclosed inU.S. 4,378,431, issued to Brown, which is incorporated by reference herein. Many varieties of cellulose producing microorganisms, particularly Acetobacter xylinum, exist and are virtually ubiquitous in natural surroundings such as damp forests for example. A suitable nutrient medium for Acetobacter culture isSchramm Hestrin medium Schramm et al., J. GeneralBiology 11, pp. 123 129, 1954 comprising about 20 g l glucose 5 g l peptone 5 g l yeast extract 2.7 g l anhydrous dibasic sodium phosphate and 1.15 g l citric acid monohydrate. The pH of the medium is adjusted to between about pH 3.5 and about pH 5.5 by the addition of hydrochloric acid. Another suitable nutrient medium comprises about 8 volume percent vinegar, 5 volume percent ethanol and 4 weight percent malt extract. Any of a wide variety of nutrient media having a pH between about 3.5 and about 5.5 are suitable for the practice of the present invention see Bergey, cited above . Such suitable nutrient media may preferably include a hexose, most preferably glucose, acetic acid and yeast extract.Yet another suitable nutrient medium, adjusted to the above described pH range, is corn steep liquor. In one embodiment of the present invention, a cellulose producing microorganism, most preferably Acetobacter xylinum, is inoculated into a volume of suitable nutrient medium. The inoculated nutrient medium is introduced into a shaped mold which is permeable to gases and yet substantially retains the nutrient medium and microorganism to produce a filled mold. The nutrient medium and microorganism may also be separately introduced to the mold and mixed therein. The shaped mold preferably comprises a membrane or film of natural or synthetic polymer, sufficiently porous to allow gaseous diffusion therethrough while substantially retaining the liquid nutrient medium and microorganisms therein.Among the porous materials preferably utilized in the practice of the present invention are polyvinyl chloride, cellulose, cellulose derivatives such as cellulose acetate or cellulose nitrate and polyethylene. Many other materials comprising synthetic or natural polymers well known to those skilled in the art are usable as porous materials to produce the shaped molds, for example, of the present invention. After the suitable nutrient medium and cellulose producing microorganism have been introduced into the shaped mold, the resultant filled shaped mold is preferably suspended in the air or in an oxygen enriched gaseous environment or may rest upon a porous surface therein. To minimize evaporative liquid losses, the filled mold is most preferably incubated in an enclosed chamber containing a separate reservoir of water to maintain a humid atmosphere. As the inoculated filled mold is incubated at a temperature between about 200C and about 300C for a period between about 2 days and about 21 days, microbial cellulose is produced and passes from the microorganisms, which themselves are growing and multiplying. The produced microbial cellulose, after sufficient period, forms a relatively uniform shaped object of hydrated microbial cellulose having the form of the mold. The shaped object may then be collected from the mold for use or further processing. Such shaped objects of hydrated microbial cellulose, after washing and any desired trimming, are usable as, for example, flexible contact lenses, wound dressings or burn dressings or gloves, for example. Examples of further processing of the shaped objects to produce different products include impregnation with proteins, peptides, amino acids, vitamins, other nutrient flavoring agents or texturing agents individually or in combination. Such impregnated shaped microbial cellulose objects function as edible artificial foods or nutritional supplements useful as produced or dried for stabilization and later consumption. Yet other forms of further processing include, for example, drying the shaped objects to produce particular containers, structural supports, packaging materials or absorbents. In particular cases, the microbial cellulose objects could be subjected to chemical treatment such as chemical derivatization with, for example, acetyl chloride to form cellulose acetate objects which in turn may be physically modified to form a nonwoven cellulosic textile. In view of the above described aerobic suspension of permeable molds containing nutrient medium inoculated with cellulose producing microorganisms, other embodiments of the invention are apparent. In a second embodiment of the present invention, a cast, which comprises material permeable to gases and encloses a quantity of oxygencontaining gas is immersed in nutrient medium inoculated with a cellulose producing microorganism. The microorganism produces cellulose at the liquid material interface to substantially coat the cast. After this coating has proceeded to a desired degree, the cast, coated with hydrous microbial cellulose, may be removed and used or processed further, for example by drying, chemical derivatization or cast removal, if desired. Further embodiments of the present invention comprise methods of continuous microbial cellulose production.Many well known processes are available for fermentations where fresh nutrient is continually added to a bacterial culture while depleted nutrient containing metabolic waste products is withdrawn. When such a continuous fermentation of cellulose producing microorganisms is conducted in contact with a structure comprising material permeable to gases and an oxygen containing gas is circulated on one side of said material, cellulose will be continually produced on the second side of the material which contacts the culture. A continual mechanical withdrawal of cellulose so produced may be conducted and the withdrawn cellulose directly utilized or further processed. Materials permeable to gases and suitable for use in the processes of the present invention include those comprising polyvinylchloride, cellulose, or cellulose derivatives. Further suitable gas permeable materials usable in the processes of the present invention are known in the field of blood oxygenator design as shown byHaworth Physiological and Clinical Aspects of OxygenatorDesign, 1976 eds. Davids and Engell, Elsevier NorthHolland Biomedical Press, pgs. 293 to 298 . These suitable gas permeable materials include silicone rubber, silicone rubber compounded with silica particles, silicone polycarbonate co polymers, polyalkylsulphone and microporous membranes of polytetrafluoroethylene or silicone.The materials permeable to gases of the present invention may include materials comprising these described as useful in the field of blood oxygenator design. The production of microbial cellulose by practice of the present invention may be altered by the use of agents which, alone or in combination, change the form of microbially produced cellulose. The addition to culture media containing cellulose producing microorganisms of various agents such as certain fluorescent brightening agents, direct cellulose dyes or cellulose derivatives alters the fibrous structure of product cellulose. Fluorescent brightening agents include those of the diaminostilbene type such as 4,4 bis 4 anilino 6 bis 2 hydroxy ethyl amino 1,3,5 triazin 2 ylamino 2,2 stilbenedisulfonic acid. Direct cellulose dyes include trypan blue, congo red, amidine red and benzo orange. Cellulose derivatives include carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, and hydroxypropylcellulose Brown et al J. Appl. Polymer Sci. Appl. Polymer Symp.Vol. 37 pp. 33 78, 1983 . Microbial cellulose, as shaped objects, sheets, fibers or other forms produced by the practice of the present invention may be used or processed in many different ways. Among the methods of use is the inclusion of fibrous microbial cellulose as reinforcing fiber in cementitious mixtures, as has been demonstrated with wood pulp fiber Coutts, et al., 1983, J. Appl. PolymerSci. Applied Polymer Symp., Vol. 37, pp. 829 844 . The treatment of cellulose and cellulose derivatives with liquid ammonia L NH3 is well known process Herrick, idem, pp. 993 1023 . Microbial cellulose produced by the process of the present invention may be likewise processed with L NH3, for example to produce ammoniated cellulosic fibers with improved tensile strength, or reduced extensibility to increase the structural strength of nonwoven cellulosic textiles to increase the structural strength of nonwoven cellulosic textiles and to form cellulosic derivatives after L NH3 cellulose activation. A wide variety of cellulose derivatives are particularly useful to prepare liquid crystal solutions. These derivatives include various hydroxyalkyl cellulose ethers, numerous cellulose esters of carboxylic acids, cellulose sulfate, and cellulose nitrate Gray, idem, pp. 179 192 .Such derivatives may as easily be prepared from microbial cellulose produced according to the present invention and the derivatives utilized as liquid crystals. Zugenmeier idem, pp. 223 238 discusses the molecular conformation of cellulose esters, cellulose alkyl ethers and cellulose urethanes as disclosed by x ray diffraction patterns. The above cited four references, Coutts et al. Herrick Gray and Zugenmeier all from the 1983 Journal of Applied Polymer Science are relevant to the present invention in their descriptions of cellulose derivatives and uses and are incorporated by reference herein. Microbial cellulose produced by the processes of the present invention may be utilized for the production of woven and non woven textiles or liquid crystals. The wide variety of cellulose derivatives available by the processes shown or discussed in the above cited references are all applicable to microbial cellulose, the particular conditions being available after only routine modifications and experimentation. The product microbial cellulose need only be subjected to the various available methods of alteration or derivatization. The present invention offers advantages over prior related technology, which include, for example, increased rates of oxyaen dependent microbial cellulose synthesis, precise control and determination of the three dimensional shape of objects produced therewith, and the continuous production of micorbial cellulose when desired. The following examples are meant to elucidate the performance of particular embodiments of the present invention and are not meant to be limiting unless otherwise so indicated herein. EXAMPLE 1 Sterile polyvinyl chloride gloves Fisher Scientific 11 294 120A Disposable Vinyl Gloves were used as shaped molds permeable to gases and subjected to the introduction of about 250 ml of Schramm Hestrin nutrient medium pH 5.5 . Each medium containing glove was inoculated by introducing 1.5 ml of an Acetobacter xylinum AmericanType Culture Collection No. 23679 culture containing about 106 cells ml and obtained from a four day aerobic and static culture of said microorganism in Schramm BR Hestrin medium. Excess air was squeezed out of the filled gloves and the glove open ends sealed by being tied. The sealed gloves were then suspended in a one liter beaker which was covered to retain humidity. The covered beaker containing the nutrient medium and Acetobacter xylinumcontaining molds was incubated at 250C. After three days of incubation one of the molds was removed and opened. A cellulosic object had formed on the inner surface of the mold, creating a hollow cast in the shape of a hand. The object did not stick to the mold and was readily removed intact. After six days of incubation a second mold was removed and opened. The resultant shaped object of microbial cellulose, more massive than the three day object, was readily removed and found to have completely filled finger portions while the palm region of the shaped object was yet hollow. EXAMPLE 2 Two portions of seamless cellulose dialysis tubing having an average dry inflated diameter of about 2 cm Fisher Scientific Cat. No. 08 667C and referred to hereafter as 2 cm diameter dialysis tubing was immersed in distilled water and sterilized by standard autoclaving.Two portions of the dialysis tubing having lengths of about 20 cm were tied off and filled with Schramm BR Hestrin nutrient medium containing about 106 Acetobacter xylinum ATCC strain no. 23769 cells ml. One filled tubing was suspended in an enclosed glass cylinder above a small quantity of distilled water to maintain a humid aerobic environment and the second filled tubing was immersed in sterile Schramm Hestrin medium contained in an enclosed glass cylinder. Both glass cylinders and their contents were incubated for two days at about 250C and then the filled tubing removed, opened, and their contents examined. The tubing having been suspended in the humid aerobic environment was found to be completely filled with a cylindrically shaped object of microbial cellulose.The cylindrically shaped microbial cellulose object was easily removed from the mold, had a clear jellylike center, and was whitish on the surface formerly contacting the dialysis tubing. This microbial cellulose object, about 2 cm in diameter could be twisted and stretched without breaking to a thread of less than about 1 mm diameter or could be pressed between flat surfaces into a sizeable thin sheet. When the filled tubing which had been incubated while suspended in Schramm Hestrin medium was opened, it was found that only a few small wisps of microbial cellulose were present. The need for an ample supply of oxygen for cellulose production was thus illustrated. EXAMPLE 3 Another aspect of the present invention was illustrated by sterilizing a length of the 2 cm diameter dialysis tubing and then tying in a quantity of air to produce an air filled dialysis sack. The air filled sack was then immersed in Schramm Hestrin medium held in a capped conical tube and containing about 106 cells ml ofAcetobacter xylinum American Type Culture Collection no.23769 . After incubation for a period of 3 days at about 250C the dialysis sack was removed and found to be largely encased ty a thin and clear layer of microbial cellulose. EXAMPLE 4 A length of sterile dialysis tubing with a 2 cm diameter was filled with Schramm Hestrin medium inoculated with about 106 cells ml of Acetobacter xylinum. The filled tubing was suspended in a capped cylinder half filled with Schramm Hestrin medium so that the lower half of the filled tubing was immersed in the medium.After three days of incubation at about 250C, the tubing was removed, opened and the content examined. The upper half of the tubing contained a thick cylindrical formation of microbial cellulose while the lower half had a thin membraneous formation. This observation was consistent with the apparent demand for oxygen of microbial cellulose production. EXAMPLE 5 The potential usefulness of several materials for mold construction was evaluated. Freshly boiled distilled water was utilized to fill petri dishes which were then covered with polyvinylchloride Fisher Scientific 11 29412A disposable vinyl gloves SARAN Wrap or unstretchedPARAFILM Amercan Can Company . After three hours under ambient conditions the water samples in the filled covered Petri dished were measured for oxygen content by immersion therein of an oxygen electrode which was connected to an oxygen monitor. When air saturated water was calibrated to yield a reading of 100 and nitrogen saturated water, 0 ó the polyvinylchloride covered sample read 86 the SARAN Wrap covered sample, 72 and the PARAFILM covered sample, 68 . The results generally indicate the material permeability to oxygen and thus suitability for use as the material permeable to gases of the present invention. EXAMPLE 6 The formation of microbial cellulose described in EXAMPLE 3 particularly, as well as the other examples will permit the construction of apparati for continuous production of microbial cellulose. For example, a continual flow fermentation process with cellulose producing microorganisms may be designed where, a deep vat culture ofAcetobacter xylinum, for example, is subjected to a continuous input of fresh liquid nutrient medium. Immersed in this deep vat liquid culture would be a multiplicity of substantially hollow columns constructed of material permeable to gases. These columns will be connected to a source of gaseous oxygen such as air for example, such that fresh oxygen will be circulated therein. The oxygen, diffusing through the permeable column walls will facilitate Acetobacter growth and cellulose production thereupon, analogous to that seen in EXAMPLE 3 herein. Harvesting the cellulose may be begun in many ways, one of which would be to initially wrap a string, for example around the permeable column. After a cellulosic film has formed about the column, forming hydrogen bonds to the string, the string may be gradually pulled away from the column to draw a portion of the microbial cellulose deposit therewith. The cellulose deposit, having great tensile strength as described in EXAMPLE 2, for example, would follow and may then be continually withdrawn as a cellulosic fiber. The cellulosic fiber from the permeable columns may be continuously collected from the culture as individual strands from each column or as combined strands for use or further processing, for example as a textile fiber. Changes may be made in the construction, operation and arrangement of the various segments, elements, steps and procedures described herein without departing from the inherent concept and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.
