# Test device, composition and method for the determination of triglycerides.

## Abstract
A method and composition for the hydrolysis and assay of triglycerides are disclosed. The method includes the steps of adding lipase and cholesterol esterase to a triglyceride in combination with a glycerol assay system and determining the amount of triglycerides present based on the amount of glycerol produced. The composition includes a mixture of lipase, cholesterol esterase and a glycerol assay system.
