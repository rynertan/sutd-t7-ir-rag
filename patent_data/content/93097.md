# CARRIAGE CHASSIS

## Abstract
The invention relates to a sprung chassis particularly for perambulators or baby carriages. The chassis includes two side members 1 abd two axles 2 uniting said members and arranged at right angles thereto. Either end of each axle is rigidly attached to one end of a swinging arm 6 having a U shaped downwardly omen cross section, which straddles the side member 1 with a good sliding fit, the other end of the swinging arm being pivotably connected to the side member via a pivoting shaft 7 parallel to the axle. The arm 6 has a greater height than the side member 1 and the axle 2 is attached to the bottom portion of the arm side walls at a distance below the underside of the side member 1 . A helical spring 8 is arranged on a vertical bolt 9 extending through holes in the side member 1 and the portion of the swinging arm 6 above the side member. At its upper end the bolt has a head 10 engaging against the upper side of the swinging arm 6 , and a nut 11 at its lower end, the spring 8 being confined between the nut 11 and the underside of the side member 1 .
