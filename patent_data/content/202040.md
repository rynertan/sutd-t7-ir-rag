# Flame retardant, impact resistant polyamide compositions.

## Abstract
A fire retardant, impact resistant polyamide composition containing 1 to 25 of a rubbery copolymer containing functional groups derived from maleic, fumaric, norborna diene and succinic anhydrides or an alicyclic carboxylic acid or functional derivative thereof having a cis form double bond in the ring, 10 to 30 of a halogenated polymer having a weight average molecular weight greater than 5,000 and a synergist for the halogenated fire retardant. The composition provides a good level of impact strength in combination with a high level of fire retardancy. A particularly good balance of properties can be obtained from compositions containing fillers, especially glass fibres.
