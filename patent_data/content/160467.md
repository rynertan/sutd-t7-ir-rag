# ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY, BIBULOUS SUPPORT FOR USE THEREIN, AND AN ASSAY KIT

## Abstract
Methods and devices are provided involving heter ogeneous enzyme assays. A simplified protocol for the assays results from incorporating enzyme substrate on a bibulous support to which is conjugated a member of a specific binding pair. Upon introduction of the support into the assay medium, the substrate diffuses into the medium, eliminating a separate development step for the assay.
