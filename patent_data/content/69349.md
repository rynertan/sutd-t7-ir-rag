# Magnetic recording media.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a magnetic recording medium comprising substrate and a resinous composition containing magnetic particles of uniaxially anisotropic hexagonal crystals having particle diameters of 0.01 0.3 Âµm and coated on said substrate the ratio of remanent magnetization to saturation magnetization on the magnetiztion curve corrected to demagnetizing field which is measured in a direction vertical to the surface of the recording medium, ranging from 0.3 to 0.7. This magnetic recording medium requires no orientation treatment for its production.
