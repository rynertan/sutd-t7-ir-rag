# Electrostatic ink jet printing apparatus and method.

## Abstract
An electrostatic ink jet printing apparatus and method uses a linear array of nozzles 2 each of which records a seg ment of a row of pixels in a given raster pattern. The pixel seg ment is recorded by electrostatically deflecting the ink drops 5 from a nozzle 2 to the pixels contained within the seg ment. The drops 5 from adjacent nozzles 2 are stitched or aligned to these ideal pixel positions by aligning the ink drop streams to drop position sensors 16, 17 . Two sensors 16, 17 are used for each nozzle. Preferably, adjacent nozzles share sensors. The sensors are spaced relative to each other to very close tolerances. Consequently, alignment of each noz zle to its two drop position sensors means that the drops from adjacent nozzles are aligned or stitched .
