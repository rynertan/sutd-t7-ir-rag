# Clock recovery circuit for burst communications systems.

## Abstract
On the receiver side of a burst communications system, such as a time division multiple access TDMA system, the clocks of every burst have to be recovered and synchronized. The clock recovery circuit 104 of the present invention com prises an oscillator 3 with a frequency substantially equal to the clock frequencies, a phase difference detection circuit 2 , an averaging circuit 4 for averaging the phase differences detected, a memory circuit 6 for storing the averaged phase difference, a control circuit 5 , and a phase shift circuit 7 generating a recovered clock S based on the output from the oscillator 3 and the phase difference read out from the memory circuit 6 . The recovered clock of a burst issued by a station is used as the clock for a subsequently incoming burst of the same station. Thus the response time required in con ventional clock recovery devices is avoided and the S N ratio of the recovered clocks is improved.
