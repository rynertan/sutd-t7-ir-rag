# Self aligning web reel.

## Abstract
A plurality of flangeless reel hubs store webs of a flexible material from a sitting operation. To quickly remove the filled reels 20 from the individual clutch members 22 the inner driven diameter of the hub of the reel 20 includes elongated diamond shaped teeth 38 . These teeth match with slots in the individual driving clutches. The teeth are centered and driven by the shaped slots which align and positively drive the reel. Relief cutouts 54 are provided to accommodate the compression pressure against the hub by the many layers of web material wound under high tension onto the outer circumference of the reel hub. A single shaft with slots to match the teeth in the reel can be used to align the reels, and individual vacuum columns 58 can accom modate the tension differences between the individual webs.
