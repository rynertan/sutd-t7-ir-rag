Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 is a partial side view of a machine tool fitted with the present invention Fig, 2 is a schematic view showing one embodiment of the invention for detecting a target in the form of a drill Fig, 3 is a section through the waveguide of the broken took detecting system shown in Fig, 2 illustrating the E field intensity in the waveguide when the target is removed therefrom Fig 4 is also a section through the waveguide illustrating the E fie d intensity in the waveguide when the target is present and Fig. 5 is another embodiment of the invention showing the target positioned at the end of the waveguide The microwave detection system according to the present invention is suitable for detecting a wide variety of targets, but is particularly useful for detecting relatively small targets such as drill bits at relatively close range Thus the microwave detection system according to the present invention is particularly useful in combination with an automatic drilling machine wherein a number of drilling operations are being conducted simultaneously as the microwave detection system according to the present invention is capable of detecting the presence or absence of a plurality of targets, With reference to the Figures, automated drilling machine 9 is utilized to drill extremely small holes in a stack of printed circuit boards 10, The machine includes at least one pressure foot assembly 11 in each drilling station that houses a retractable drill 12. While the present invention is particularly useful for drill targets having a diameter that is at or below 0,013 it is also useful for larger size targets and planar surfaces as well, The microwave detection system of the present invention is shown as 13 retrofitted to the pressure foot assembly of the machine Since the system does not require physical contact, it can be mounted in any convenient location to detect the continuity or the discontinuity of the target, the detection system includes a waveguide 15 and a transceiver module 17.The waveguide passes through the work zone of the drilling station and is terminated by an adjustable shorting stub 18 of the type that is well known and used in the art, The waveguide shown is rectangular in cross sectional form and contains two small coaligned holes 19 19 centered in the top broadwall 20 and the bottom broadwa 21 of the waveguide, Normally, the elongated shank of the drill 12 is contained in the holes and sufficient c earance is provided therebetween to enable the drill to move vertically towards and away from the work, The drill in Fig, 1 is shown in a broken condition although in operation the drill would be within the waveguide for detection, With reference to Figure 2, transceiver module 17 contains a local oscillator 23, which may be a Gunn diode, that is positioned at one end of the waveguide to propagate a microwave signal down the waveguide toward the target which for illustration is a drill, The adjustable shortening stub is positioned in the waveguide behind the target and is arranged to reflect a well defined return signal back toward the module, The receiver section of the module includes a detector such as a Schottky diode 25 and a mixer circuit 26. The return wave signal is picked up by the diode 25 and is apyjied to the mixer along with a sample of the transmitted signal.The two input signals are heterodyned down to baseband in the mixer to provide an easily detectable D,C. output signal indicative of the amplitude rather than the frequency of the return signal the mixer output is coupled directly via line 29 to a comparator 30 through amplifier 31 so that only the D,C. component of the output signal is applied to the comparator, The microwave system operates on the principle that the presence of a continuous target, such as a fine drill, in or near the end of the waveguide at a predetermined location produces a change in the standing wave ratio SWR of the transmitted signal , This change in the SWR is capable of being detected by the receiver to provide a signal that is indicative of the target condition.The comparator threshold can be set to detect either the presence or the absence of a target, Although the present system resembles a doppler radar, it should be apparent that it does not operate on the doppler effect in that the frequency component of the output signal is not utilized in the comparator circuit, As will be explained in greater detail below, the present system is adjusted to provide a clear indication of changes in the amplitude of the D,C, output signal component to determine the presence or absence of a specific target rather than its movement toward or away from the transceiver, The waveguide dimensions are specifically adjusted for the particular system application to provide for maximum detection sensitivity so long as the width of the waveguide permits transmission, Variations in the height of the waveguide will affect the power level of the transmissions and thus affect the overall sensitivity of the system. The location of the shorting stub is also important, Preferably the stub is located at the N M4 or N y8 distance from the centerline of the target where A is the wavelength of the transmitted signal and N is some positive integer.By so positioning the shorting stub. the waveguide is tuned to the transmitted signal to allow detection to be carried out on the linear part of the return signal As noted, the local oscillator propagates an electromagnetic wave down the hollow rectangular waveguide which is terminated at the shorting stub, The openings 19 for the tool, which are contained in the broadwal 1 s of the waveguide are minimized to provide sufficIent clearance to allow the tool to move axially therein without touching the waveguide, Insertion of a tool into the waveguide causes a change in the magnitude and phase of the reflected wave incident at the transceiver 17, The transceiver heterodynes the signal down to baseband so that the amplitude of the signal D,C, component translates to an easily detectable offset change, The cross sectional dimensions of the waveguide and the operating frequency of the local oscillator are scaled to any values that are compatible with dominant mode only wave propagation, The system is tolerant in regard to the exact positioning of the tool opening 19 and the stub positioning however, it is preferred that these locations be optimized for specific applications, The E field intensity within the waveguide is shown in Figs, 3 and 4 for dominant mode propagation, The normal E field profile across the cross section of the waveguide is shown in Fig, 3 with the maximum strength of the field occurring at central axis 22 of the waveguide and falling off symmetrically to either side thereof, When a tool 12 is positioned in the waveguide, it shorts the E field at the axis and produces a pronounced change in the profile of theE field as graphically displayed by the arrows in Fig, 4, By selecting the operating frequency and the waveguide dimensions for dominant mode operation only, the tool acts like a shorting stub to an incident wave and produces a discernible change in the phase and amplitude of the return Let the total E field incident plus reflected waves at the transceiver pe denoted by VE, which can be written VE W, expax rexp oxg where VO i s the incident wave at the load a is the complex propagation constant for the waveguide r is the complex reflection coefficient of the load x is the distance from VE to the loadA short section of waveguide can be regarded as being without loss if the too aperature is sufficiently small. Therefore a becomes EMI14.1 where z is the operating frequency in rad sec c is the speed of light in free space and nazis the width of the waveguide broadwall.If the transceiver unit generates a simple sinusoidal signalA exp jwt at the central axis, equations l and 2 yield VE A exp jwt exp jssx rexp 3 The load reflection coefficient is now equal to l since either the shorting stub or the tool will present a short circuit to the incident E field.Equation 3 thus becomes VE 2A sin Sx Cexp j u t ssx ir 2 4 The transceiver, because it is directly coupled to the comparator, will only detect the D.C, related component of equation 4 which takes the form VEmax where 6 2A sin x and 2 ax When the tool is removed from the waveguide x It ls 6 and when the tool is present in the waveguide x lt 7 Thus, equations 5 7 define the amplitude and the phase at the transceiver for either the presence or the absence of the tool. With reference to Fig. 2, the present invention will be e x p l a i n e d in regard to a simple homodyne transceiver, The baseband mixer D.C. component output of the homodyne transceiver is given by EMI15.1 where 6 is an arbitrary phase constant and K is the mixer conversion constant.Using equations 5 through 8 , the following relationship is obtained for the condition where the tool is absent from the waveguide SOD.C. KAsin ss It Is cos 2 ss lt Is 9 and when the tool is present SOD.C. KAsin sslt cos 2 glt io As can be seen, by using either equation 9 or 10 the physical parameters of the target detection system can be easily optimized for any given application so that the output of the comparator can be used to either automatically shut down the machine and or sound an alarm indicating a discontinuation in the target, Because of certain size constraints, there may be times when the target cannot be passed through the waveguide. In this case, the shorting stub is removed from the waveguide and the distal end of the guide is opened to atmosphere. As illustrated in Fig, 5, the target, which in this case is illustrated by fine wire 50, is positioned at the opening in close proximity with the end face of the waveguide The target is located a distance 4 or . 8 times some positive integer from the output of the transceiver As explained above in greater detail , the parameters of the system can be easily optimized for the x 1 mode of operation In this application, the signal sent out by transceiver 52 along the waveguide 51 is somewhat attenuated because of the absence of the shorting stub, however, the return is detectable so that the condition of the target can be ascertained accurately. Other and further uses and modifications of the microwave detection system of the present invention will be more fully appreciated by those skilled in the art
