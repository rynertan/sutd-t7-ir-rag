## Description
1,2,4 TRIAZOLES The present invention provides 1 acyl 3 5 alkyl 5 3 phenyl 1,2,4 triazoles which have antiirSlani natory properties and have the structureEMI1.1 wherein R is lower alkyl or cycloalkyl, RÚ is lower alkyl or cycloalkyl, and X is hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, nitro or trifluoromethyl. The preferred compounds of the invention are those of formula I wherein X is in the meta or para preferably the para position and is halogen, R is methyl or ethyl, and R1 is methyl or ethyl. The term lower alkyl as used herein refers to alkyl groups naving 1 to 7 carbons, preferably 1 to 4 carbons, including straight or branched chain groups, such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, i propyl, 2 propylbutyl, n butyl, s butyl, i butyl, t butyl, n pentyl, n hexyl, and n heptyl and the various branched chain isomers thereof. The term lower alkoxy as used herein refers to lower alkyl groups as defined above attached to an oxygen atom, with methoxy being preferred. The term cycloalkyl as used herein refers to saturated carbocyclic radicals containing 3 to 7 carbons in the ring, such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl or cycloheptyl. The term halogen as employed herein refers to chlorine, bromine, iodie or fluorine with chlorine and bromine being preferred. East German Patent No. 67,130 to Becker et al describes a procedure for the synthesis of 3,5 disubstituted 1,2,4 triazoles useful as intermediates. The product triazoles are formed as follows. A starting material of structureEMI2.1 wherein R1 is alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkoalkyl, acylaminoalkyl, or a heterocyclic group and R2 is hydrogen, alkyl, or aryl, is treated with acylating agent such as an acid chloride or acid anhydride or an alkylating agent such as an alkylhalide.Depending on conditions, the product is isolated directly or as its salt or an intermediate product or residue of undefined structure or composition is first isolated and then converted to the triazole product by thermolysis or hydrolysis. A by product is described in several examples which is a diacyl or dialkyl hydrazine presumably arising from the l, y3razino portion of the starting triazole that is lost in the course of the reaction. In Example 10 of the Becker et al patent,N 4 3,5 dimethyl 1,2,4 triazolyl benzamidine is reacted with acetic anhydride at 1700C for 2 3 hours with evaporation of the volatile materials to form a residue Rückstand of unknown composition and utility. The residue is heated for 3 hours in water to give the 3 methyl 5 phenyl 1,2,4 triazole product. Becker et al neither identify the components of the residue nor separate out or isolate such components. However, it is believed that about one half of the Rückstand or residue is a mixture of various by products, and the remainder is a mixture of l acetyl 5 methyl 3 phenyl lH 1,2,4 triazole and l acetyl 3 methyl 5 phenyl 1H 1,2,4 triazole in about a 90.10 ratio to each other. Becker et al in a paper entitled A NovelSynthesis for 3 Substituted 1,2,4 Triazoles, Journal fur praktische Chemie. Volume 311.1969, pages 477 489, disclose the preparation of 3 substituted 1,2,4 triazoles include 3 phenyl 1,2,4 triazoles of the structure EMI4.1 wherein R1 can be ethoxy, methyl, ethyl or n propyl.A general preparation for l acetyl 3 phenyl1,2,4 triazole and l propionyl 3 phenyl 1,2,4 triazole is set out on page 487. U. S. Patent No. 4,006,159 to Newman discloses mixtures of acyl subsultuted 1,2,4triazole 3 carboxamides which may be present by the following structural formulae EMI4.2 l acyl s triazole 3carboxamide 2 acyl s triazole 3carboxamide 4 acyl s triazole 3carboxamide wherein each mixture consists of all three forms wherein R is the same in each form and wherein R is hydrogen, alkyl having up to 15 carbon atoms cycloalkyi having from 3 to 8 carbon aroms phenyl ortho , meta , or para hydroxyphenyl ortho , meta , or paramethoxyphenyl or adamantyl.The above mixture is said to be useful as antiviral agents. The compounds of the present invention having the structure of the formulae I and II may be prepared according to a modification of the procedure outlined in East German Patent 67,130 1969 , Chem. Abst. 71, 124441e. Thus, a benzonitrile of the structureEMI5.1 is condensed with an amino 1,2,4 triazole of the structureEMI5.2 in the presence f an alkali metal hydride, such as sodium hydride or lithium hydride, and a nonreacting solvent such as dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide or dioxane, to fonci a compound of the structure EMI6.1 The formula V compound is then reacted with an acid anhydrideEMI6.2 such as acetic anhydride, propionic an hydride, butyric anhydride and the like to yield a mixture cf the formulae I and II compounds of the invention. The mixture may be separated into the formula I compound and the formula II compound by crystallization from an appropriate solvent, such as ethanol or isopropyl ether or by chromatography on a suitable adsorbent, such as silica gel. The formulae I and II compounds may be separately recovered iff crystalline form each at least 95 and preferably 99 pure. The starting triazole of structure IV is prepared by techniques well known in the art e.g., see Th. Cartius and G M. Dedichen,J. Prakt. Chem., 50, 241 1894 , Beil. 26, 29 .Thus, the formula IV compound may be prepared by reaction of hydrazwne and an alkyl cyanide of the structureVII RCN wherein R is lower alkyl or cycloalkyl, under high temperatures ranging from 100 to 250, preferably from 140 to 1900C, for periods of 0.5 tc 48 hours in a sealed system, if necessary. The compounds of formula I have antiinflammatory activity as measured by the mouse active arthus MAA test and or other related tests and are useful as antiinflammatory agents and may be used, for example, in a manner similar to phenylbutazone or indomethacin. They may be nsed to decrease joint swelling, tenderness, pain and stiffness in mammalian species, e.g., in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.The quantity administered ranges from about 1 mg to about 150 mg per kg and preferably from about 5 mg to about 75 mg per kg of body weight per day. A compound of formula I or II can be administered orally or parenterally for example, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously . Powders can be prepared by comminuting t active ingredient with a similarly comminuted diluent such as starch or lactose.Suitable forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, troches, elixirs, wafer, chewing gum, syrups, and a suitable form for parenteral administration in a sterile injectable.Such unit dosage forms are prepared by compounding with a conventional vehicle, excipients, binders, preservatives, stabilizers, flavoring agents or the like as called for by acceptable pharmaceitical practice. Also, the compounds used in this invention can be formulated with other pharmaceutically active compounds. The tablets, troches, pills, capsules and the like may also contain the following a binder suc l as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin an excipient such as dicalcium phosphate, a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like a lubricant such as magnesium stearate and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin may be added or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen or cherry flavoring. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain in addition to materials of the above type a liquid carrr such as a fatty oil.Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit, for instance, tablets, pills or capsules may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propyl parabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any dosage unit form should be pharmaceutically pure and substantially non toxic in the amounts employed. The invention thus extends to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound cf the invention or a mixture thereof in a physiologically acceptable vehicle and to a method for treating an inflammatory condition in a mammalian host which comprises administering an effective amount of a compound of the invention.
