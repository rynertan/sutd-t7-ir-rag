# Differential pressure valve.

## Abstract
A pressure differential valve connected to a refrigerating circuit piping which, when a refrigerating cycle stops, blocks the high pressure coolant from diffusing into the low pressure section. Said pressure differential valve comprises a valve body having a first inlet, a first outlet, a second inlet and a sec ond outlet a valve disk installed in a valve chamber between the first inlet and the first outlet to open or close the passage between the first inlet and outlet, the valve disk being urged to open by a spring a diaphragm installed between the second inlet and the second outlet to form pressure chambers and a check valve secured to the diaphragm and communicating to both of the pressure chambers whereby when the check valve is closed, the diaphragm causes, through a connecting rod, the valve disk to close. Said valve disk has radially projecting guide vanes attached to the axially extending portion of the seat contacting disk to form spaces through which coolant can flow.
