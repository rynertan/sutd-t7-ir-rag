# A variable size circular aperture camera.

## Abstract
Apparatus is disclosed for exposing circular patterns of light on photosensitive surface 13 by providing spaced from the surface a lengthwise variable light source 16 focusable on the photosensitive surface and causing relative rotation and rotatable relative to the surface about an axis of rotation passing through the center of the photosensitive surface and the light source. In a modification the axis of rotation passes through the center of the photosensitive surface and through a point radially offset from the light source.
