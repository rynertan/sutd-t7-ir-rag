# A METHOD FOR DEEP DRAWING

## Abstract
A method for deep drawing sheet wherein i the sheet is formable by deep drawing and ii the sheet is in the form of a blank having a flange portion and a center portion comprising the following steps a cooling the blank to a temperature no higher than about minus 50 C b heating the flange portion to a temperature higher than the center portion and sufficient to establish a temperature differential between the flange portion and the center portion of about 40 C to about 150 C and c drawing the blank into a concave deep drawing die using a mating convex punch, the center portion being initially at a temperature no higher than about 0 C and the drawing being effected at a speed sufficient to maintain the temperature differential established in step b .
