# Rotary cutting tool, and tool driver and holder.

## Abstract
A tool driver and holder for rotary cutting tools, such as reamers and drill bits, comprises a shank member 10 having a cylindrical portion 11 projecting axially from one end thereof and this cylindrical portion 11 has at least two tool securing and driving spline members 12 projecting longitudinally from the end thereof remote from the shank 10 . These spline members have arcuate outer faces 21 and radially inwardly extending side faces merging into a convex inner face to provide a central axial gap and symmetrically disposed radial gaps therebetween. A cylindrical sleeve member 14 is rotatably mounted on the cylindrical portion 11 and splines 12 and this sleeve member 14 has at the outer ends thereof radially inwardly projecting tool holding tab members 15 . The sleeve 14 and associated tab members 15 are positionable between a tool securing and a tool releasing position. The tool holder is adapted to receive a symmetrical reversible fluted cutting tool 19 of generally cylindrical outer configuration having curvilinear flutes formed in the outer face thereof symmetrically disposed about and extend ing the length of the tool body, defining peripheral lands between the flutes, retaining indentations 29 formed in the lands at the mid point of the tool body, and cutting edges formed in both end regions of the tool.
