# SILICA RICH, POROUS AND NONPOROUS FIBERS AND METHOD OF PRODUCING SAME

## Abstract
Porous and nonporous, alkaline tolerant, solid silica rich fibers are produced from forming glass fibers of an alumi num borosilicate composition having extractable compo nents and nonextractable components comprising silica and one or more metal oxides from a metal of Group IV of the Periodic Chart, and extracting the extractable components with or without heat treating the glass fibers. The nonporous silica rich fibers are produced from the porous silica rich fibers by reconsolidated through heat treatment to shrink the pores.
