## Description
CRF AND ANALOGS This invention is directed to peptides related to the hentetracontapeptide CRF and to methods for pharmaceutical treatment of mammals using such peptides. More specifically, the invention relates toCRF and analogs of CRF, to pharmaceutical compositions containing CRF or such analogs and to methods of treatment of mammals using CRF or such analogs. Experimental and clinical observations have supported the concept that the hypothalamus plays a key role in the regulation of adenohypophysial corticotropic cells secretory functions. Over 25 years ago,Guillemin, Rosenberg and Saffran and Schally independently demonstrated the presence of factors in hypothalamus which would increase the rate of ACTH secretion by the pituitary gland incubated in vitro or maintained in an organ culture. None of the secretagogs characterized to date meets the criteria expected of a pHysiologic corticotropin releasing factor, CRF.Accordingly the purification of a large CRF has been pursued. Starting material for the purification was an early side fraction of the 490,000 ovine hypothalamic fragments originally extracted in the Laboratory forNeuroendocrinology at The Salk Institute, as described in Burgus et al. Hypothalamus and Endocrine Functions F. Labrie et al. eds. Plenum, New York, 1976, p. 355.None of the earlier attempts at purification were felt to have obtained this large molecular weight CRF in a purity of greater than about 1 . Sauvagine is a 40 residue, amidated generally similar peptide which was isolated from the skin of theSouth American frog Phyllomedusa sauvagei, was characterized by Erspamer et al. and was described inRegulatory Peptides, Vol. 2 1981 , pp. 1 13.Sauvagine has the formula pGlu Gly Pro Pro Ile Ser Ile Asp Leu Ser Leu Glu Leu Leu Arg Lys Met Ile Glu Ile Glu Lys Gln Glu Lys Glu Lys Gln Gln Ala Ala Asn Asn Arg Leu Leu Leu Asp Thr Ile NH2. Sauvagine has been reported to have biological activity in lowering blood pressure in mammals and in stimulating the secretion of ACTH and 13 endorphin. CRF has now been isolated, purified and characterized as a hentetracontapeptide having the formula H Ser Gln Glu Pro Pro Ile Ser Leu Asp Leu Thr Phe His LeuLeu Arg Glu Val Leu Glu Met Thr Lys Ala Asp Gln Leu Ala Gln Gln Ala His Ser Asn Arg Lys Leu Leu Asp Ile Ala NH2. It may alternatively be referred to as Amunine. The synthesis of the 41 residue peptide has been completed, and both the isolated CRF and the synthetic CRF have been found to stimulate ACTH and B endorphin activies in vitro and in vivo. Synthetic CRF has been found to substantially lower blood presssure for an extended time period. As a result CRF has been made available in substantially pure form i.e. substantially free of the remainder of a crude biological extract or of related synthetic replicates , and a purity of at least about 93 or higher is practically obtainable and useful for clinical testing. Analogs of the 41 residue peptide CRF having the following formula have at least substantially the same biological activity Z R1 Pro Pro Ile Ser R8 Asp Leu R11 R12 R13 Leu Leu Arg R17 R18 R19 Glu R21 R22 Lys R24 R25 R21R26 R27 R28 Gln Gln Ala R32 R33 Asn Arg R36 Leu Leu Asp R40 R41 NH2 wherein Z is hydrogen or an acyl group having 7 or less carbon atoms and or a peptide up to 10 residues long R1 is Ser Gln Glu or pGlu Gly or Gln Glu or Glu or D Ser Gln Glu orD pGlu Gly or desR1 R8, R12, R19 R24 and R40 are selected from the group consisting of Leu,Ile, Ala, Gly, Val, Nle, Phe and Gln R11 is Thr orSer R13 is His, Tyr or Glu R17 is Glu or Lys R18 is Val or Met R21 is Met, Met O , Ile, Ala,Leu, Gly, Ule, Val, Phe or Gln R22 is Thr or Glu R25 is Asp or Glu R26 is Gln or Lys R27 is Leu,Ile, Ala, Gly, Val, Nle, Phe, Asp, Asn, Gln or Glu,R28 is Ala or Lys R32 is His, Tyr or Ala R33 isSer, Asn, Thr or Ala R36 is Lys or Leu R41 is Ala,Ile, Gly, Val, Leu, Nle, Phe, Gln or des R41, provided however that when R13 is His, then R17 is Giu, R18 is Val, R22 is Thr, R26 is Gin, R28 is Ala, andR36 is Lys and provided that when R13 is Glu, R17 is Lys, R18 is Met, R22 is Glu, R26 is Lys, R28 is Lys, R32 is Ala and R36 is Leu, then either R1 is not pGlu Gly or R8 is not Ile or R11 is Thr orR12 is not Leu or R19 is not Ile or R21 is not Ile or R24 is not Gln or R27 is not Glu or R33 is notAsn or R40 is not Thr or R41 is not Ile. Pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the invention include CRF or its analogs, or nontoxic addition salts thereof, dispersed in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or solid carrier. The administration of such peptides or pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts thereof to mammals in accordance with the invention may be carried out for the regulation of secretion of ACTH, 13 endorphin, lipotropin, and corticosterone and or for the lowering of blood pressure and or for affecting mood, behavioral and gastrointestinal functions. CRF has been isolated from ovine hypothalamic extracts, purified and characterized. The nomenclature used to define the peptides is that specified bySchroder Lubke, The Peptides , Academic Press 1965 wherein, in accordance with conventional representation, the amino group appears to the left and the carboxyl group to the right. Where the amino acid residue has isomeric forms, it is the L form of the amino acid that is represented unless otherwise expressly indicated. The invention provides CRF and analogs of CRF having the following formula Z R1 Pro Pro Ile Ser R8 Asp Leu R11 R12 R13 Leu Leu Arg R17 R18 R19 Glu R21 R22 Lys 24 25R26 R27 R28 Gln Gln Ala R32 R33 Asn Arg R36 Leu Leu Asp R40 R41 NH2 wherein Z is hydrogen or an acyl group having 7 or less carbon atoms and or a peptide up to 10 residues long R1 is Ser Gln Glu or pGlu Gly or Gln Glu or Glu or D Ser Gln Glu orD pGlu Gly or desR1 R8, R12, R19, R24 andR40 are selected from the group consisting of Leu,Ile, Ala, Gly, Val, Nle, Phe and Gln R11 is Thr orSer R13 is His, Tyr or Glu R17 is Glu or Lys R18 is Val or Met R21 is Met, Met O , Ile, Ala,Leu, Gly, Nle, Val, Phe or Gln R22 is Thr or Glu R25 is Asp or Glu R26 is Gln or Lys R27 is Leu,Ile, Ala, Gly, Val, Nle, Phe, Asp, Asn, Gln or Glu R28 is Ala or Lys R32 is His, Tyr or Ala R33 isSer, Asn, Thr or Ala R36 is Lys or Leu R41 is Ala,Ile, Gly, Val, Leu, Nle, Phe, Gln or des R41, provided however that when R13 is His, then R17 is Giu, R18 is Val, R22 is Thr, R26 is Gin, R28 is Ala, andR36 is Lys and provided that when R13 is Glu, R17 is Lys, R18 is Met, R22 is Giu, R26 is Lys, R28 is Lys, R32 is Ala and R36 is Leu, then either R1 is not pGlu Gly or R8 is not Ile or R11 is Thr orR12 is not Leu or R19 is not Ile or R21 is not Ile or R24 is not Gln or R27 is not Glu or R33 is notAsn or R40 is not Thr or R41 is not Ile. The peptides are synthesized by a suitable method, such as by exclusively solid phase techniques, by partial solid phase techniques, by fragment condensation or by classical solution addition. CRF and certain analogs may also be synthesized by recently developed recombinant DNA techniques. Common to chemical syntheses of peptides is the protection of the labile side chain groups of the various amino acid moieties with suitable protecting groups which will prevent a chemical reaction from occurring at that site until the group is ultimately removed. Usually also common is the protection of an alpha amino group on an amino acid or a fragment while that entity reacts at the carboxyl group, followed by the selective removal of the alpha amino protecting group to allow subsequent reaction to take place at that location. Accordingly, it is common that, as a step in the synthesis, an intermediate compound is produced which includes each of the amino acid residues located in its desired sequence in the peptide chain with various of these residues having side chain protecting groups. Also considered to be within the scope of the present invention are intermediates of the formula X R1 Pro Pro Ile Ser Xê R8 Asp X5 Leu R11 X12 5 R12 R13 Leu Leu Arg X3 R17 R18 R19 Glu X R R 6 R24 R25 R26 427 21 22 Lys X R24 R28 Gln X4 Gln X4 Ala R R33 Asn X4 3 R,, Leu Leu Asp XJ 7 Arg X R36 Leu Leu Asp X R40 R41 X 1 wherein the R groups are as hereinbefore defined X is either hydrogen or an a amino protecting group. The amino protecting groups contemplated by X are those known to be useful in the art in the step wise synthesis of polypeptides.Among the classes of a amino protecting groups covered by X1 are 1 acyl type protecting groups, such as formyl, acrylyl Acr , benzoyl Bz and acetyl Ac which are preferably used only at the N terminal 2 aromatic urethan type protecting groups, such as benzyloxycarbonyl Z and substituted Z, such as p chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl, p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, p methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl 3 aliphatic urethan protecting groups, such as t butyloxycarbonyl BOC , diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, i sopropyloxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl 4 cycloalkyl urethan type protecting groups, such as cyclopentyloxycarbonyl, adamantyloxycarbonyl, and cyclohexyloxycarbonyl and 5 thiourethan type protecting groups, such as phenylthiocarbonyl.The preferred a amino protecting group is BOC. X2is a protecting group for the hydroxyl group of Thr and Ser and is preferably selected from the class consisting of acetyl Ac , benzoyl Bz , tert butyl, triphenylmethyl trityl , tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl ether Bzl and 2,6 dichlorobenzyl DCB . The most preferred protecting group is Bzl. Xê can be hydrogen, which means there is no protecting group on the hydroxyl group. X3 is a protecting group for the guanidino group of Arg preferably selected from the class consisting of nitro, p toluenesulfonyl Tos , Z, adamantyloxycarbonyl and BOC, or is hydrogen. Tos is most preferred. 4 X is hydrogen or a protecting group for the amido group of Asn or Gln and is preferably xanthyl Xan . 5 X is hydrogen or an ester forming protecting group for the B ora carboxyl group of Asp or Glu, preferably selected from the class consisting of benzyl, 2,6 dichlorobenzyl, methyl, ethyl and t butyl ester.OBzl is most preferred. X6is hydrogen or a protecting group for the side chain amino substituent of Lys. Illustrative of suitable side chain amino protecting groups are Z, 2 chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl 2 Cl Z , Tos, t amyloxycarbonyl Aoc , BOC and aromatic or aliphatic urethan type protecting groups as specified hereinbefore. When Met is present, the sulfur may be protected, if desired, with oxygen. When His is present, the imidazole nitrogen can be protected withTos or 2,4 dinitrophenyl DNP . When Tyr is present, the hydroxyl group may be protected with DCB. The selection of a side chain amino protecting group is not critical except that it must be one which is not removed during deprotection of the amino groups during the synthesis. Hence, the amino protecting group and the side chain amino protecting group cannot be the same. X7 is selected from the class consisting ofOH, OCH3, amides, hydrazides, esters and an amide anchoring bond used in solid phase synthesis for linking to a solid resin support, represented by the formulae O CH2 benzyl polyamide resin support, NH benzhydrylamine BHA resin support, and NH paramethylbenzhydrylamine MBHA resin support.The polyamide polymer is commercially available and is discussed in detail in Bioorganic Chemistry, 8, 351 370 1979 where a preferred version of it is discussed inFigure 6. Use of BHA or MBHA resin is preferred, and cleavage gives the CRF amide or CRF analog amide. In the formula for the intermediate, at least one of XÚ , Xê , X , X4 , X5 and X6 is a protecting group. Depending upon the particular amino acids chosen for the R groups, they may also have a protecting group attached as specified hereinbefore and as generally known in the art and mentioned hereinbefore.In selecting a particular side chain protecting group to be used in the synthesis of the peptides, the following rules are followed a the protecting group must be stable to the reagent and under the reaction conditions selected for removing the amino protecting group at each step of the synthesis, b the protecting group must retain its protecting properties and not be split off under coupling conditions and c the side chain protecting group must be removable, upon the completion of the synthesis containing the desired amino acid sequence, under reaction conditions that will not alter the peptide chain. For the acyl group represented by Z, acetyl, formyl, acrylyl and benzoyl are preferred. For the 1 to 10 amino acid peptide which may be optionally included without adversely affecting the potency, any amino acids may be used, but the L or D forms of the naturally accurring amino acids would normally be used. The peptides are preferably prepared using solid phase synthesis, such as that described byMerrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 85, p 2149 1964 , although other equivalent chemical syntheses known in the art can also be used as previously mentioned.Solid phase synthesis is commenced from the C terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected a amino acid to a suitable resin as generally set forth in U.S. Patent No. 4,244,946 issued Jan. 21, 1981 to Rivier et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such a starting material for CRF can be prepared by attaching O amino protected Ala to a BHA resin. Ala protected by BOC coupled to the BHA resin using methylene chloride and dimethylformamide DMF .Following the coupling of BOC Ala to the resin support, the amino protecting group is removed, as by using trifluoroacetic acid TFA in methylene chloride, TFA alone or with HC1 in dioxane. Preferably 50 weight TFA in methylene chloride is used with 0 5 weight 1,2 ethanedithiol. The deprotection is carried out at a temperature between about O C and room temperature.Other standard cleaving reagents and conditions for removal of specific a amino protecting groups may be used as described in Schroder Lubke, The Peptides , 1 pp 72 75 Academic Press 1965 . After removal of the amino protecting group of Ala, the remaining a amino and side chain protected amino acids are coupled step wise in the desired order to obtain the intermediate compound defined hereinbefore. As an alternative to adding each amino acid separately in the synthesis, some of them may be coupled to one another prior to addition to the solid phase reactor. The selection of an appropriate coupling reagent is within the skill of the art. Particularly suitable as a coupling reagent is N,N dicyclohexyl carbodiimide DCCI . The activating reagents used in the solid phase synthesis of the peptides are well known in the peptide art. Examples of suitable activating reagents are carbodiimides, such as N,N diisopropyl carbodiimide and tJ ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide. Other activating reagents and their use in peptide coupling are described by Schroder Lubke, supra, in Chapter III and by Kapoor, J. Phar. Sci., 59, pp 1 27 1970 . Each protected amino acid or amino acid sequence is introduced into the solid phase reactor in about a fourfold excess, and the coupling is carried out in a medium of dimethylformamide DMF CH2C12 1 1 or in DMF or CH2C12 alone. In instances where the coupling is carried out manually, the success of the coupling reaction at each stage of the synthesis is monitored by the ninhydrin reaction, as described by E.Kaiser et al., Anal. Biochem. 34, 595 1970 . In cases where incomplete coupling occurs, the coupling procedure is repeated before removal of the a amino protecting group prior to the coupling of the next amino acid. The coupling reactions can be performed automatically, as on a Beckman 990 automatic synthesizer, using a program such as that reported in Rivier et al., Biopolymers, 1978, 17, pp.1927 1938. After the desired amino acid sequence has been completed, the intermediate peptide is removed from the resin support by treatment with a reagent, such as liquid hydrogen fluoride, which not only cleaves the peptide from the resin but also cleaves all remaining 2 3 4 5 side chain protecting groups X , X3, X4, Xs and X6 and the amino protecting group X1 unless it is an acyl group which is intended to be present in the final peptide , to obtain the peptide. When using hydrogen fluoride for cleaving, anisole and methylethyl sulfide are included in the reaction vessel as scavengers. When Met is present in the sequence, theBOC protecting group may be cleaved with trifluoroacetic acid TFA ethanedithiol prior to cleaving the peptide from the resin to eliminate S alkylation. The following Example sets forth the preferred method for synthesizing analogs of CRF by the solid phase technique. EXAMPLE I The synthesis of the CRF having the formula H Ser Gln Glu Pro Pro Ile Ser Leu Asp Leu Thr Phe His Leu Leu Arg Glu Val Leu Glu Met Thr Lys Ala Asp Gln Leu AlaGln Gln Ala His Ser Asn Arg Lys Leu Leu Asp Ile Ala NH2 and a molecular weight of 4666 is conducted in a stepwise manner on a benzhydrylamine hydrochloride resin, such as available from Bachem, Inc., having a substitution range of about 0.1 to 0.5 mmoles gm.resin. The synthesis is performed on an automaticBeckman 990A peptide synthesizer. Coupling of BOC Ala results in the substitution of about 0.35 mmol. Ala per gram of resin. All solvents that are used are carefully degassed, preferably by sparging with an inert gas, e.g.helium or nitrogen, to insure the absence of oxygen that might undesirably oxidize the sulfur of the Met residue. After deprotection and neutralization, the peptide chain is built step by step on the resin.Generally, one to two mmol. of BOC protected amino acid in methylene chloride is used per gram of resin1 plus one equivalent of 2 molar DCCI in methylene chloride, for two hours. When BOC Arg Tos is being coupled, a mixture of 50t DMF and methylene chloride is used. Bzl is used as the hydroxyl side chain protecting group forSer and Thr. P nitrophenyl ester ONp is used to activate the carboxyl end of Asn or Gln, and for example, BOC Asn ONp is coupled overnight using one equivalent of HOBt in a 508 mixture of DMF and methylene chloride. The amido group of Asn or Gln is protected byXan when DCC coupling is used instead of the active ester method. 2 C1 Z is used as the protecting group for the Lys side chain.Tos is used to protect the guanidino group of Arg and the imidazole group of His, and the side chain carboxyl group of Glu or Asp is protected by OBzl. At the end of the synthesis, the following composition is obtained BOC Ser Bzl Gln Xan Glu OBzl Pro Pro Ile Ser Bzl Leu Asp OBzl Leu Thr Bzl Phe His Tos Leu Leu Arg Tos Glu OBzl Val Leu Glu OBzl Met Thr Bzl Lys 2 Cl Z Ala Asp OBzl Gln Xan Leu AlaGln Xan Gln Xan Ala His Tos Ser Bzl Asn Xan Arg Tos Lys 2 Cl Z Leu Leu Asp OBzl Ile Ala resin support.Xan may have been partially or totally removed by TFA treatment used to deblock the a amino protecting group. In order to cleave and deprotect the resulting protected peptide resin, it is treated with 1.5 ml.anisole, 0.5 ml. of methyl ethyl sulfide and 15 ml.hydrogen fluoride HF per gram of peptide resin, first at 20 C. for 20 min. and then at O.OC. for one half hour. After elimination of the HF under high vacuum, the resin peptide is washed alternately with dry diethyl ether and chloroform, and the peptides are then extracted with de gassed 21 aqueous acetic acid and separated from the resin by filtration. The peptide is purified by gel permeation followed by semi preparative HPLC as described in Rivier et al., Peptides Structure and Biological Function 1979 pp. 125 128. The chromatographic fractions are carefully monitored by HPLC, and only the fractions showing substantial purity were pooled. Specific optical rotation of the CRF peptide, which was synthesized and purified in the foregoing manner, was measured on a Perkin Elmer Model 141 as alpha D22 77.5 1.0 c l in 1 acetic acid without correcting for the presence of H2O and TFA and had a purity of about 96 .To check whether the precise sequence was achieved, the CRF peptide was hydrolyzed in sealed evacuated tubes containing 4N methanesulfonic acid and 0.28 tryptamine for 24 hours at 1l00C. Amino acid analyses of the hydrolysates using a Beckman 121 MB amino acid analyzer showed the following amino acid ratios Asp 4.02 , Thr 1.85 , Ser 2.76 , Glu 7.0 , Pro 1.58 , Ala 4.03 , Val 0.96 , Met 0.95 , Ile 1.93 , Leu 8.15 , Phe 1.00 , Lys 2.00 , His 1.95 andArg 1.98 , which confirmed that the 41 residue peptide structure had been obtained. EXAMPLE II CRF was extracted, isolated and purified in the following manner. 490,000 ovine hypothalamic fragments were extracted in ethanol acetic acid chloroform, defatted with a mixture of ethyl ether and petroleum ether and subjected to repeated shake out with the partition system 0.18 acetic acid n butanol pyridine 11 5 3 . The combined aqueous phases showACTH releasing activity. Following dialysis Spectrapor 3 against 2NHOAc, about 350,000 fragment equivalents of the retentates weighing 15 grams were subjected to gel filtration on Sephadex G 50. The bulk of material was chromatographed at cold room temperatures in 9 successive runs using a 3.1 x 150 cm. G 50 column eluted with 2 N HOAc. The zone showing the most significantACTH releasing activity eluted at about 1.3 Ve VO. A portion of the material from this zone, about 130,000 fragment equivalents, was subjected to ion exchange on SP Sephadex. The sample was applied in 0.01M ammonium formate buffer, pH 3.2 and eluted with a linear gradient of the application buffer to 1 5 M ammonium formate, pH 7.0. ACTH releasing activity was weakly absorbed. The ACTH releasing fraction fromSP Sephadex and the remainder of the zone fromSephadex G 50 were dissolved in 6 M guanidine HCl HOAc, pH 2.5, heated 5 min. at 900, then chromatographed onBiogel P 10 with 4 M guanidine HCl HOAc, ph 2.5.TheACTH releasing fractions were pooled and purified further by successive high pressure liquid chromatographic HPLC steps which included 1 Reverse phase HPLC on Bondapak CN Waters and Associates using a gradient of decreasing triethylammonium phosphate TEAP and increasing acetonitrile 2 Reverse phaseHPLC on Bondapak C18 Waters and Associates withTEAP acetonitrile and either 3a Reverse phase HPLC onBondapak Ct with gradients of triethylammonium formate and acetronitrile, or 3b Reverse phase HPLC on C18 with gradients of trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile.Lyophilized active zones from both HPLC steps 3a or 3b were used for composition and structural analysis which gave the following sequence H Ser Gln Glu Pro Pro Ile Ser Leu Asp Leu Thr Phe His LeuLeu Arg Glu Val Leu Glu Met Thr Lys Ala Asp Gln Leu Ala Gln Gln Ala His Ser Asn Arg Lys Leu Leu Asp Ile Ala NH2. EXAMPLE III The synthetic and the natural CRF were examined for their effects on the secretion of ACTH and ss endorphin in vitro and the synthetic CRF was also examined in vivo. The high potency of synthetic and natural CRF to stimulate the secretion of ACTH andB endorphin by cultured rat pituitary cells was measured. Minimal and half maximal responses were observed at about 10 picomolar and about 100 picomolar of synthetic CRF, respectively. The secretory response to maximal 5nM concentrations of CRF is at a plateau level. In vivo doses from 30 ng to 3 pg Kg of body weight rapidly elevated ACTH and B endorphin like ss END LI secretion 5 20 fold. Synthetic CRF has been shown to be a powerful stimulator of ACTH and B END LI secretion in vivo in several rat preparations. Plasma levels of ACTH and ss END LI are elevated for at least 5 20 minutes following the intraveneous administration of CRF to nembutal anesthesized male rats and to quiescent male or female rats with indwelling intravenous cannulae. In addition, CF is found to have a dramatic effect upon blood pressure in rats and dogs.Mean cartoid blood pressure in a urethane anesthesized rat fell from 87 to 72 2 mm Hg and remained at that level for 30 minutes following an injection equal to 3 pg CRF Kg body weight the subsequent administration of an injection equal to 30 g CRF Kg body weight lowered mean blood pressure to 42 3 mm Hg for more than 2 hours.

Testing in accordance with the general procedure set forth in Example III shows that it likewise stimulates the secretion of ACTH and ss END LI and causes a very significant lowering of blood pressure. It is of interest that CRF and its analogs exhibited such an extreme lowering of blood pressure.As a result, these peptides may be particularly valuable for the treatment of high blood pressure conditions and also for the treatment of patients who are to undergo certain types of surgery. As CRF profoundly stimulates the pituitary adrenalcortical axis, CRF or its analogs should be useful to stimulate the functions of this axis in some types of patients with low endogenous glucocorticoid production. For example, CRF should be useful in restoring pituitary adrenal function in patients having received exogenous glucocorticoid therapy whose adrenalcortical functions remain supressed. Most other regulatory peptides have been found to have effects upon the central nervous system and upon the gastrointestinal tract. Because ACTH and B END secretion is the sine qua non of an animal s response to stress, it is likely that CRF should have significant effects on the brain as a mediator or limiter of the body s stress response. Accordingly, CRF may also find application in modifying the mood and behavior of normal and mentally disordered individuals. Because CRF and its analogs elevate the levels of ACTH, ss END, B lipotropin and corticosterone, its administration can be used to induce their effects on the brain and its periphery to thereby influence memory, mood, pain appreciation, etc., and more specifically, alertness, depression and or anxiety. It is also believed that relatively larger amounts of CRF or some of its more potent analogs may function in a manner similar to the way that GnRH superagonists inhibit reproductive functions. Thus, these peptides may be able to desensitize CRF targat organs and thus be valuable in the treatment of subjects with Cushing s disease and similar disorders. CRF, its analogs or the nontoxic addition salts thereof, combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to form a pharmaceutical composition, may be administered to mammals, including humans, either intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intranasally, intracerebrospinally or orally. The peptides should be at least about 93 pure and preferably should have a purity of at least about 988.This purity means that the intended peptide constitutes the stated weight of all like peptides and peptide fragments present. Their administration may be employed by a physician to lower blood pressure or to stimulate endogenous gluco corticoid production. The required dosage will vary with the particular condition being treated, with the severity of the condition and with the duration of desired treatment. Such peptides are often administered in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic salts, such as acid addition salts or metal complexes, e.g., with zinc, iron, calcium, barium, magnesium, aluminum or the like which are considered as addition salts for purposes of this application . Illustrative of such acid addition salts are hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, phosphate, tannate, pamoate, oxalate, fumarate, gluconate, alginate, maleate, acetate, citrate, benzoate, succinate, malate, ascorbate, tartrate and the like. If the active ingredient is to be administered in tablet form, the tablet may contain a binder, such as tragacanth, corn starch or gelatin a disintegrating agent, such as alginic acid and a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate. If administration in liquid form is desired, sweetening and or flavoring may be used, and intravenous administration in isotonic saline, phosphate buffer solutions or the like may be effected. The peptides should be administered under the guidance of a physician, and pharmaceutical compositions will usually contain the peptide in conjunction with a conventional, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.Usually, the dosage will be from about 1 to about 200 micrograms of the peptide per kilogram of the body weight of the host. In some instances, treatment of subjects with these peptides can be carried out in lieu of the administration of ACTH or corticosteroids, in such instances a dosage as low as about 10 ng Kg of body weight may be employed. As used herein all temperatures are C and all ratios are by volume. Percentages of liquid materials are also by volume. Although the invention has been described with regard to its preferred embodiments, which constitute the best mode presently known to the inventors, it should be understood that various changes and modifications as would be obvious to one having the ordinary skill in this art may be made without departing from the scope of the invention which is set forth in the claims appended. hereto. For example, substitutions and modifications at other positions in the CRF peptide chain can be made in accordance with present or future developments without detracting from the potency of the analogs, and such peptides are considered as being within the scope of the invention.
