## Description
The present invention relates to a method for fabricating a dielectric isolated DI integrated circuit IC device. It relates more particularly to a method for fabricating an improved DI substrate so as to remove inherent drawbacks associated with its fabricating process. The use of dielectric isolation DI instead of pn junction isolation in the fabrication of IC devices becomes progressively widespread in specific fields. Due to their reduced parasitic capacitance and very high inter device breakdown voltage, the DI IC devices are widely used for apparatus where breakdown damage may occur, such as switching devices for subscriber line interface circuits SLIC of electronic telephone exchangers. Dielectric isolation is a method for fabricating IC in which circuit components are isolated by dielectric layers. Fig. 1 is a partial cross sectional view of a prior art DI semiconductor substrate. There are electrical element regions 7 or islands , isolated from each other and from a substrate 6 by individual dielectric layers 4, usually a silicon dioxide SiO₂ layer. The substrate 6 has a thickness sufficient to support the islands and to ensure the necessary mechanical strength for the device to be handled. The prior art fabrication of a DI wafer begins with preparing a one conductivity type doped single crystal silicon substrate original silicon substrate , followed by the formation of insulating moats 3 for islands 7 on the surface. Subsequently, a dielectric layer such as a SiO₂ layer 4 is formed covering the entire surface of the wafer, over which silicon is deposited by a conventional chemical vapor deposition CVD method using a silicon halide hydrogen reduction process, to form a layer of a predetermined thickness. The deposited silicon layer is grown at high temperature such as 1100 C to form a polycrystalline silicon polysilicon layer. The wafer is then inverted and the original single crystal silicon layer is ground enough to reveal the DI layers 4 for the islands 7. Finally the front surface of the wafer is finished to a smooth defect free surface ready for further fabrication of electrical circuits thereon. The above process can be understood more easily by observing Fig. 1 upside down. Fig. 1 shows a substrate after the above processes are completed. Usually, each island 7 accomodates a circuit element such as a transistor or a film resistor. The island contains a one conductivity single crystal silicon layer where the circuit element is formed. A heavily doped layer 5 is included to reduce the saturation resistance of the collector of a transistor formed in the island 7. There are substantial problems in the fabrication of the DI substrate. One of them is the bow phenomenon, consisting in the warpage or curvature of the multi layer structure of the wafer after the formation of the polysilicon substrate layer 6 on the dielectric layer covering the original silicon substrate. There is a difference of expansion coefficient between single crystal silicon and polysilicon. The polysilicon layer is grown at high temperature and the wafer is cooled to room temperature, causing stresses inside said wafer which cause the structure to bow . Another problem occurs when some humps or projections of coarse structure of polysilicon, formed in the peripheral edge of the wafer, are mechanically removed. Tiny broken pieces of polysilicon mechanically cause damages to the surface of the wafer during surface grinding process, reducing the wafer yield. Furthermore, channels for scribing formed on the DI wafer are covered with the dielectric layer, in the same way as other island areas. Accordingly, scribing cutters are easily abraded when cutting the hard dielectric layer. These are problems associated with the prior art method for fabricating a DI substrate. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method for fabricating a dielectric isolated DI IC device. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method for fabricating a DI substrate effective in raising the fabrication yield and reducing the fabricating cost of the DI substrate. These objects are attained by a method which comprises, according to the invention, the steps consisting in In document DE A 2 451 861 is described a method for forming monosilicon zones between polysilicon zones which correspond to moats isolating islands in an IC device. It is pointed out that the formation of monosilicon zones between isolated islands of an IC device or in scribing regions between ICs on a wafer does not form part of the present invention. As stated hereinbefore,problems are encountered when fabricating a DI substrate by a method according to the prior art, and it will be understood by those skilled in the art that these problems are caused by the polysilicon substrate 6. Therefore, the formation of polysilicon structure for said substrate is not desirable. However, as long as the silicon deposition for forming said substrate is performed on a dielectric layer, the formation of the polysilicon structure is inevitable. A single crystal silicon structure is only obtained by depositing silicon on an exposed single crystal silicon surface. The dielectric layer is indispensable only to island areas, and areas for mounting circuit elements, but unnecessary for other areas such as scribing channel areas, the peripheral area including the edge portion of the wafer and a contact area for the substrate. With the method according to the invention, for the regions other than the island regions, the formation of the dielectric layer is prevented using for example a conventional masking technology, leaving exposed portions of the original single crystal silicon surface. For example, the formation of the dielectric layer is selectively prevented over the areas for scribing channels, the peripheral area of the wafer and a contact area for the polysilicon substrate so as to expose the original single crystal silicon surface. As a result, single crystal silicon layers are formed selectively and partially over the areas described above, amongst the polysilicon layer. With thus formed DI substrates, the above mentioned drawbacks can be eliminated or at least reduced. The mismatching effect of the expansion co efficients of single crystal silicon and polysilicon is limited to the dice which are much smaller than the whole wafer, resulting in the reduction of the bow phenomenon, or warpage of the wafer. During the mechanical processing, such as grinding work for shaping or rounding the peripheral area or edge of the wafer, the generation of destructive polysilicon particles is reduced, because the machining is effected on a portion of single crystal silicon. And, when the wafer is scribed into a number of dice, it can be easily cut along predetermined scribing regions channels , since an abrasive dielectric layer such as silicon dioxide does not exist therein and harmful polysilicon particles are not generated, resulting in the reduction of the wear of the scribing cutters. Furthermore, the single crystal silicon is easily scribed along its cleavage plane, providing the die with smoother side walls than when scribing a polysilicon substrate. This method is also applicable to form a contact for the polysilicon substrate, on the front surface of the die, enabling an easy connection of the substrate to a fixed potential. Embodiments of the present invention will now be disclosed with reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 2 is a perspective view,partially in cross section,of a portion of a DI wafer fabricated by a method according to the present invention. It should be noted that single crystal silicon layers 19 are selectively formed inside a polysilicon substrate 16 beneath scribing channels 18. The fabrication steps of this DI substrate are disclosed with reference to Figs. 3 to 10. A one conductivity type, n type doped, for instance, single crystal silicon wafer 11 is prepared, followed by the subsequent forming of a silicon dioxide SiO₂ layer 12 over the surface of the wafer 11, leaving windows for isolating moats 13 as shown in Fig. 4, by the use of a conventional lithographic technology. The isolation moats 13 define the island areas as will be seen later. Then, a silicon nitride Si₃N₄ layer 20 is formed selectively over the portion of the SiO₂ layer 12 corresponding to the scribing regions 18 by the use of a conventional method. Next, the isolation moats 13 are created by anisotropic etching through the windows, resulting in moats 13 having a V shaped cross section. After removing the SiO₂ layer 12, except for the portion under the silicon nitride layer 20, by etching, a heavily doped, n type silicon layer 15 is formed over the entire surface of the wafer by a conventional method as shown in Fig. 5. Following this step, a thermal oxide layer 14 is grown over the entire surface of the wafer except the region covered by the silicon nitride layer 20 as shown in Fig. 6. The thermal oxidation is performed in a pressurized environment of for example 5 atm. The silicon oxide layer 14 forms the isolation layer between the single crystal silicon layer 11 and a polysilicon layer which is to be created later. The thickness of the oxide layer 14 is relatively high, such as 1.0 µm or more, while that of the silicon dioxide layer 12 formed at the earlier step is relatively low, such as approximately 0.4 µm 4000 Å . After removing the silicon nitride layer 20 by etching with phosphoric acid, a controlled etching is applied to the entire surface of the wafer, until the thin oxide layer 12 is completely removed to expose the underlying single cystal silicon surface 18 where a scribing region is to be formed. However, as shown in Fig. 7, the thick oxide layer 14 having a predetermined thickness still remains, covering the area 17 where the islands are to be formed and the surfaces of the isolation moats 13. Subsequently, as shown in Fig. 8, a silicon layer is grown over the entire surface of the substrate, comprising the surface of the oxide layer 14 and the exposed single crystal silicon surface 18, by a conventional CVD method, using a silicon halide such as trichlor silane SiHCl₃ . Naturally, a single crystal silicon portion 19 is grown over the surface 18 and a polycrystalline silicon portion 16 is grown over the silicon dioxide layer 14. Following the formation of the substrate layers 16 and 19, the device is inverted and the original single crystal silicon layer 11 is ground off mechanically until the silicon dioxide layers 14 covering the side walls of the moats 13 are revealed on the ground surface as shown in Fig. 9. At this step, the islands 17 are isolated from each other by the silicon dioxide layers 14 as clearly seen in Fig. 9. Thus, a DI wafer is completed. As shown in Fig. 10, using a conventional method, an IC circuit element is created in each island of the completed wafer, which is divided into dice by scribing at the scribing regions 18 comprising single crystal silicon only. Therefore, the scribing tool used, usually a diamond cutter, is not as easily damaged as when used for scribing prior art wafers. In addition, the side walls of each die are smooth and clean since the single crystal silicon is fractured along a cleavage plane. Another embodiment will now be disclosed referring to Figs.11 to 15. The modification lies in the method for exposing the surface of the original single crystal silicon layer 11, as shown in Fig. 7 or 15, a photoresist layer being used. A single crystal, substrate 11 is masked with a silicon dioxide layer 12 patterned by a conventional photolithographic technology for opening windows for the moats 13 as shown in Fig. 11. Isolation moats 13 having a V shaped cross section are formed in the same way as in the former embodiment, as shown in Fig. 12, followed by the formation of heavily doped n type layer 15 and thick oxide layer 14, consecutively, as shown in Fig. 13. After this step, a photoresist layer 21 is formed over the surface of the oxide layer 14, selectively opening windows 20 for the scribing regions by using a conventional photolithographic technology Fig. 14 . By etching off the thick oxide layer 14 through the windows 20, the areas where the scribing regions are to be formed, on the surface of the original single crystal silicon substrate 11, are exposed as shown in Fig. 15, after which, the photoresist layer 21 is removed by chemical etching or dry etching. The subsequent fabricating steps are the same as in the case of the former embodiment described. The method for forming a single crystal silicon portion in a polysilicon substrate can be applied to a peripheral region 22 of the wafer, which is denoted by a hatched area in Fig. 16. As illustrated in this Figure, the wafer comprises dice 24 and a peripheral region 22. The dice 24 are separated from one another by cutting the wafer at the scribing regions 18. During the scribing, the scribing tool, such as a cutting grinder, is not abraded as easily as in a prior art method, since the material of the scribing region is single crystal silicon. Usually, when a polysilicon layer is formed on the oxide layer 14, it has many humps 25 and projections 26 of coarse grain immediately after its formation by a CVD method, as shown in Fig. 17. Therefore, it is necessary to shape and round the edge 23 and the peripheral region 22 of the wafer, for a precise working in the subsequent fabrication steps. In this case, a great number of hard and sharp particles are generated, causing damages such as scratches at the surface of the wafer. When the peripheral region 22 including the edge 23 of the wafer is of single crystal silicon, this drawback is significantly decreased, since the workability of the single crystal silicon is much better than that of polysilicon. Accordingly, it is very advantageous for the fabricating process of a DI wafer to apply the method of this invention to obtain a peripheral region 22 of single crystal silicon. The bow phenomenon previously described, still exists in the wafer fabricated according to the method of this invention, as long as a sandwich structure remains at each island. However, the effect of the discrepancy of the expansion coefficient between single crystal silicon and polycrystalline silicon is limited within each island since the scribing regions are constituted entirely of single crystal silicon and that no stress occurs inside these regions. As a result, the total quantity of bow , or warpage, is significantly reduced compared to a prior art wafer, providing a greater facility for subsequent machining work of the wafer, for obtaining a precise parallelism of the front and back surfaces of said wafer. Furthermore, the present invention is applicable to the formation of a contact of a DI IC device with a substrate, for providing said substrate with a fixed electric potential in order to prevent electrical floating, particularly for high frequency use. A cross sectional view of such contact with the substrate is illustrated in Fig. 18. In a substrate of polysilicon 116, islands 117 are formed using the method described above. In this case, one of islands 117 is modified to form a contact with the substrate 116. The bottom portion of a dielectric isolation layer 114 is removed to expose a surface of single crystal silicon, before the formation of the polysilicon substrate by a CVD method, and with the aid of the exposed surface of the original single crystal silicon substrate 111, a portion 119 of single crystal silicon is formed in the polysilicon layer 116. The fabrication process will be apparent for those skilled in the art with reference to the preceding description regarding embodiments of the present invention. A heavily doped layer 115 is not necessary but neither harmful for the contact and can be formed simultaneously with doped layers 115 for other islands 117. After completion of the DI substrate, a silicon dioxide layer 120, an n type doped contact region 121 and a wiring 125 are formed by a conventional method as shown in Fig. 18. In this case, the formation of the wiring 125 can be performed together with other wirings for circuit elements formed on islands, resulting in a saving of fabricating steps.
