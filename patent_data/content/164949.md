# PROGRAMMABLE PROGRAMMED SOCKET

## Abstract
A socket can be readily programmed to adapt the pin out configuration of an integrated circuit for convenient plug in use or substitution in an environment, such as a socket, ordinarily intended for a similar integrated circuit with a different pin out configuration. The invention includes a support, a first plurality of electrical contacts mounted in a prescribed pattern on one side of the support, a second pluality of electrical contacts mounted in a similar prescribed pattern on one other side of the support, and a programm able device, such as an EPROM, to which all the contacts are connected that can be programmed to complete or to open electrical paths between contacts. Printed circuit traces and plated through holes couple respective first contacts on the side of the support and respective second contacts on the other side of the support to the programmable device. Encapsulating material about the support, traces thereon, preferably the programmable device, and contacts where they are joined to the traces provides structural strength and integrity for the device and environmental isolation for the contact trace junctures and programmable device trace. A cover guides pin contacts to engagement with respective female contacts in the programmed socket. The invention also relates to a method of affecting the desired program med interconnections, a method of making the programmed socket and a programmable shunt device.
