## Abstract
An adhesive cleaning device comprises a roll 3 of an adhesive coated tape wound on a core 31 through which passes the axial portion 2 of a pushing handle 21 . To show the direction in which the device should be pushed over a floor so as to pick up dirt, arrows a are printed on the tape surface. The dirty portions of the tape are removed to reveal fresh tape, as needed. The core may be made so as to be easily fractured and removed from the interior of the roll when the use of the roll of tape is finished. The tape may be only partially adhesive coated if the coating is in a series of lines, the spaces between the adhesive portions allow the roll to be deformed under pressure so that the area in contact with the floor is increased.

## Description
ADHESIVE CLEANER The present invention relates to an adhesive surfaced cleaning device. An assembly comprising a roll having a handgrip and having provided on the roll a rolled adhesive tape, prepared by winding adhesive tape on a core in the manner such that the adhesive layer of the adhesive tape faces outside, is known to be used as an adhesive cleaner for cleaning a floor surface. The adhesive cleaner is generally used such that the rolled adhesive tape is moved by rotating the same to clean the floor surface. If the adhesive strength of the adhesive surface decreases by adhesion of dirt, one roll of the adhesive tape is unwound to expose a fresh adhesive surface. However, such an adhesive cleaner has the disadvantage that if the rotating direction R of the rolled adhesive tape 1 is the same as the winding direction of the adhesive tape as shown in Fig. 1 if the drawings, unwanted unwinding of the adhesive tape tends to occur and smooth cleaning of the floor surface becomes difficult. The object of the present invention is to provide an adhesive cleaner having the structure which can overcome the above described disadvantages. The adhesive cleaner according to the present invention comprises a rolled up adhesive tape, the adhesive tape comprising a tape support having provided on one surface thereof an adhesive layer, wherein a mark showing the rotating direction of the rolled adhesive tape is provided on the adhesive tape. In the accompanying drawings Figure 1 is a view showing the unwinding of the adhesive tape in a conventional adhesive cleaner Figure 2 is a perspective view of the adhesive cleaner according to the present invention Figures 3A and 3B are views of two forms of adhesive tape used in the present invention Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of a portion of a roll of the adhesive tape Figure 5 is a cross section of an adhesive tape roll showing one embodiment of the present invention Figure 6 is a cross sectional view of the core tube used in the present invention Figure 7 is a cross sectional view of another embodiment of the core tube used in the present invention and Figure 8 is a cross sectional view of a portion of the conventional cleaner. The present invention is hereinafter explained by reference to the accompanying drawings. In Fig. 2, 1 is a tube which is rotatably supported by a horizontal axis 2 having an arm 21 22 is a handgrip and 3 is a roll of adhesive tape and is prepared by winding an adhesive tape comprising a tape support having provided on one surface thereof an adhesive layer on a core 31 in the manner such that the adhesive layer faces outside. The tube 1 is provided into the rolled adhesive tape 3 so as to contact the core 31. Marks a showing the rotating direction of the rolled adhesive tape i.e., the direction opposite to the winding direction of the adhesive tape are provided on the adhesive tape over the entire length thereof. This mark can be provided along one side of the adhesive tape as shown inFig. 3A or provided along the center of the adhesive tape as shown in Fig. 3B. The adhesive tape can be prepared by printing the marks on one surface of the tape support 101 such as paper, plastic film, non woven fabric or the like , coating the adhesive layer 103 on the surface in an entire surface coating, a line like form, a stripe like form or a wave like form and then winding the coated tape in the manner such that the adhesive layer 103 faces outside as shown in Fig. 4. Further, the adhesive tape can be prepared by forming the adhesive layer 103 on the entire surface or part of the surface of the release treated layer 102 provided on one surface of the tape support 103 and then winding the coated tape in the manner such that the adhesive layer 103 faces inside. In the adhesive tape of this type, when the tape is unwound, the adhesive layer 103 is adhered and transferred on the back the release non treated surface of the layer , thereby exposing a fresh adhesive surface according to the unwinding. The adhesive tape which is wound in the manner such that the adhesive layEr faces outside requires a removable film or the like to protect the outermost surface of the adhesive layer during the storage, but the adhesive tape wherein the adhesive layer faces inside does not require such a protective film. In comparison with the adhesive tape prepared by providing the adhesive layer on the entire surface of the tape support, an adhesive tape on which the adhesive layer is orrly partial is such that the adhesive areas 103 are formed with a sufficient interval. Therefore, when such an adhesive tape is wound in a roll form, spaces 104 are formed between the tape supports and between the adhesive layers, and this space 104 provides an elastic cushioning effect to the rolled adhesive tape.Therefore, the rolled adhesive tape has a soft and deformable structure due to the cushioning effect of the space 104. Therefore, when an external force is applied, the rolled adhesive tape deforms and the contact area to the surface to be cleaned increases. As a result, even if the surface to be cleaned is uneven, the adhesive tape conforms to the uneven surface, and dirt and dust in the depressed area on the surface to be cleaned can be easily and securely catched. One embodiment wherein the degree of deformation was measured is shown below. The rolled adhesive tape according to the present invention used for measurement was prepared by winding an adhesive tape prepared by coating an adhesive layer on one surface of 0.05 irrn thick vinyl chloride film which had been release treated in the strip, like form in the coating thickness of 40 pm, on a 0.5 mm thick paper tube so as to have the roll diameter of 63 mm. The weight of the roll was 0.5 kg, and the width of the contact area to the floor surface at this time was 10 mm. Loads of 1.5 kg and 2.0 kg were applied to the roll and the width of the contact area in each. load was measured. The results obtained are shown in. the Table below.When the roll is mounted on a jig and is rotated by hand, the load l s 1 5 to 2 0 kg with a normal person. TABLE Load kg 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 Width of contact 10 15 19 21 area mm It is preferred that in order to facilitate unwinding of the tape from the rolled adhesive tape, at least one side of the tape support is the adhesive non coated area 33 as shown in Fig. 2. Further, a cut 32 can be provided on the adhesive tape. The preferred embodiment of the core 31 is explained below. In Fig. 5, 11 is the core comprising paper, a synthetic resin or the like, which core 11 is ,divided into at least two parts three parts in Fig. 5 by a cut A provided in the diameter direction. 12 is the adhesive tape or sheet comprising the tape like or sheet like support having provided on one surface thereof, which is wound on the surface of the assembly of the core 11 which is divided into at least two parts by the cut A, in the manner such that the adhesive. layer faces outside. Thus, the adhesi ve tape or sheet roll 13 is composed of the core 11and the adhesive tape or sheet 12. Figs. 6 and 7 each shows another embodiment of the core 11. Fig. 6 has the structure in which a partial cut A having the connecting portion B is formed, which is capable of substantially dividing into at least two parts, and a plurality of the connecting portion B may be formed. The core inFig. 7 has the structure such that the cut At is provided along the lengthwise direction of the core 11 to divide the core. As described above, the adhesive cleaner according to the present invention has the mark which indicates the normal rotating direction direction opposite to the winding direction of the adhesive tape of the rolled adhesive tape so that the rolled adhesive tape can be correctly rotated in the normal direction and the unwinding of the adhesive tape during cleaning as shown in Fig. 1 can be completely prevented. Further, the unwinding of the adhesive tape after use can be easily effected by providing the non adhesive portion 32 on at least one side of the adhesive tape and utilizing the same. In addition, the adhesive tape after use can be easily cut and removed with the aid of the cut 32 provided on the non adhesive portion 33, and dirt does not adhere on the side s of the tape. The adhesive tape or shett is thus wound on such a core which is .divided into at least two parts or is capable of substantially dividing into at least two parts in the manner such that the adhesive layer faces outside, so that after finishing usezof the adhesive tape or sheet, since the adhesive tape or sheet which integrally supports the core is not present, the core is divided and can be easily taken from the cover cf. Figs. 5 and 6 , or by applying pressure by hand to the core after use, the connecting portion deforms and breaks and the core can be easily taken from the cover. Moreover, the rolled adhesive tape wherein the adhesive is partially coated on the support in a stripe like, twist like or dot like form has cushioning properties, is easily deformable and is soft so that the rolled adhesive tape can contact a hard floor surface and alsq depressed areas of the grooves perform a sufficient cleaning.
