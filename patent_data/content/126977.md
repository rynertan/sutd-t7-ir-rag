# Floppy disk drive apparatus.

## Abstract
A floppy disk drive apparatus includes a spindle for holding a floppy disk 6 , a motor 10 which is driven in response to a drive signal from a drive signal generator 24 , thereby rotating the spindle, a head 12 for writing data into this floppy disk 6 and reading out data therefrom, and a control circuit 16, 21, 22, 30, 40 which detects an index hole of the floppy disk 6 and generates an index signal. This control circuit is provided with an inhibiting circuit 16, 21, 22, 30, 40 for inhibiting the drive signal supplied to the motor 10 when it has been detected that the floppy disk 6 is not held on the spindle.
