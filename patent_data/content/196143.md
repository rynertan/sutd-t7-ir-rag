## Description
Title A method of preparing an implant material, and twocomponent kit suitable therefor. This invention relates to a method of preparing an implant material on the basis of particulate bioactive ceramic biomaterial. In an article by K. Groot in Med. Progr. Technol.9, 129 136 1982 , implant materials are disclosed, including particulate bioactive ceramic biomaterials, that can be used for filling holes in bone and tooth tissue. The term biomaterials refers to materials that can be used to replace bone and tooth tissue. According to their physico chemical properties, biomaterials can be distinguished into 1 metals, 2 plastics, 3 ceramic materials, and 4 composite materials, for example, metal ceramic combinations cermets . Biologically, these products can be distinguished into 1 inert materials and 2 bioactive materials, according to whether a direct bond is or is not formed between the bone tissue, connective tissue, or epithelium tissue and the implanted material the implant . Biologically, ceramic implants are generally regarded as the most acceptable, sometimes termed the most biocompatible. Examples of inert ceramic biomaterials are aluminum oxide and a diamond like carbon derivative.Bioactive ceramic biomaterials are materials which at least in vivo and at least on the outside exhibit a physico chemical structure and composition which correspond to one or more structures and compositions which occur in the inorganic phase of bone or tooth tissue. Examples of such bioactive ceramic biomaterials are apatite, fluoroapatite, a or 6 whitlockite, calcium carbonate, magnesium containing B whitlockite, calcium phosphate, and glass ceramic such as the commercial products Ceravital Leitz, Germany and Bioglas. These known bioactive ceramic biomaterials are presented as implant materials in the particulate state. They may, for example, be introduced into the hole to be filled in the bone or tooth tissue by means of a needleless syringe together with water or saline. One disadvantage of this known implant material, however, is that both during application and afterwards the particles are difficult to maintain in position.A significant part of the particles flows away, finds its way into wrong places, and may later cause problems there. Indeed, the handling of the known implant material is difficult, and particular measures have to be taken for the particles to be kept in position after application, such as the use of a cover over the bone or tooth tissue defect treated. Moreover, only relatively small spaces can be filled with these implant materials. The present invention provides a method of the above kind which eliminates these disadvantages and is characterized in that particles of bioactive ceramic biomaterial with a particle size of at least 200 Am are made up into a mixture by means of water in the presence of a water soluble hydrocolloid in the particulate material and or in the water. The hydrocolloid is characterized in that an aqueous solution when cooled to a temperature slightly above body temperature 38400C exhibits a sol gel transition. The gel sol transition generally takes place not at the same temperature, but a higher temperature for example, 75 80 C . The method according to the invention comprises heating the mixture to above the gel sol transition temperature, whereafter the resulting sol is cooled to slightly above the sol gel transition temperature.Immediately after the implantation of the powder liquid mixture the gel state is obtained by cooling to body temperature, and so its consistency is hard. These physical reactions have been used before in preparing so called hydrocolloid or agar agar casts, that is to say, materials with which accurate negatives can be obtained from teeth see Peyton et al., Restorative Dental Materials, 4th.Edition, C.V. Mosby Co., U.S.A., 1971 , pp 187191, and Greener et al., Materials Science in Dentistry,Williams and Wilkins Co., Baltimore, U.S.A. 1972 , pp 309 314 . Known materials for making casts commonly also contain fillers to produce good processing consistency.A typical filler is, for example, calcium carbonate.In order to permit making accurate casts of fine detail, however, very fine filler is used, in particle sizes of no more than 20 to 30 sum, preferably no more than 5 to 10 cm. As regards the composition of the implant material according to the present invention, this is distinguished from known materials for making casts in the presence of particles having sizes of at least 200 plum. According to the invention, it is preferable to use particles of bioactive ceramic biomaterial having a particle size of at least 250,us. A larger particle size implies larger interspaces between the individual particles, which interspaces are sometimes referred to as macropores see K. de Groot in Ceramics in Surgery,Ed. P. Vincenzini, 1983, Elsevier Scientific PublishingCompany, Amsterdam, pp 79 80 , and promotes the ingrowth of bone and tooth tissue. Particles which are too small, i.e. less than 200 sum, would impede bone ingrowth, and are therefore unsuitable for use in implant material.A practical upper limit for the particle size is about 4 mm, although larger particles are suitable. As regards the composition of the implant material according to the invention, it is preferable that 80 99 by weight of the dry matter is constituted by particles of bioactive ceramic biomaterial, and 120 by water soluble hydrocolloid. In order to produce a paste like consistency that is easy to process, it is preferable that 30 50 ml water is used to 100 g of dry matter. Lower or higher proportions, for example 20 ml or 60 ml water to 100 g dry matter1 however, are good to use. In principle, the water soluble hydrocolloid may be present in the particulate component, while the aqueous liquid consists of water. The other possibility, i.e., that the hydrocolloid is present in the water, is also comprised by the invention. One important advantage of the implant material according to the invention is that it is much simpler to process than the known particulate material. After mixing the components, a kneadable paste is obtained, which without any loss of material can be effectively applied to the location in question and moulded. The particles of bioactive ceramic biomaterial present in the paste cannot flow away, either during application, or later. The hardened hydrocolloid is biocompatible and, in time, is absorbed in vivo. At the same time, the function of the hydrocolloid is taken over by ingrown bone or connective tissue, so that a perfect filling of the bone or tooth tissue defect results. The pastelike implant material according to the invention is in addition suitable for filling larger holes and cavities, in particular between bone and a prosthesis introduced. The invention also provides a two component kit for preparing an implant material, comprising a particulate component and a aqueous liquid with the particulate component and or the aqueous liquid containing a water soluble hydrocolloid. As observed before with reference to the method according to the invention, it is preferable for the particulate component to contain particles of bioactive ceramic biomaterial having a particle size of at least 250 Am that 80 99 by weight of the dry matter is constituted by particles of bioactive ceramic biomaterial, 1 20 by weight by water soluble hydrocolloid that the water soluble hydrocolloid is present in the particulate component and that 30 50 ml water is present to 100 g of dry matter. The invention is illustrated in and by the following examples. Example I A particulate material was prepared1 consisting of 3 g of hydrocolloid and 90 g apatite particles having a particle size of 250 3501um. This particulate material was mixed by shaking with 400 ml water, which resulted in a readily processable paste.Example II A powdered material was prepared, consisting of 3 g hydrocolloid and 90 g calcium carbonate particles having a particle size of 250 350 Dm. This particulate material was mixed by shaking with 40 g water1 whereby a readily processable paste was obtained.Example III A particulate material was prepared, consisting of 4 g hydrocolloid and 70 g ss whitlockite particles having a particle size of 2 4 mm. This particulate material was mixed by shaking with 40 ml water, whereby a readily processable paste was obtained.
