## Description
ANTIGLAUCOMA COMPOUNDS This invention relates to the treatment of glaucoma. It particularly relates to compounds of the structureEMI1.1 wherein each of R1, R2 and R3 is independently hydrogen, methyl or ethyl, and each of R4 and R5 is independently methyl or ethyl, and their pharmacologically acceptable, non toxic acid addition salts. It is to be understood that many of the aboveidentified compounds have one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and that the present invention includes all stereo isomers of the new compounds. The use of epinephrine and its salts and derivatives in the treatment of glaucoma is known in the art F.E. Leaders, et al. Arch. int. Pharmacodyn. 183, 93 106 1970 . U.S. Patent No. 3,809,714 discloses the di pivaloyl ester of epinephrine as having anti glaucoma activity. The 3,3 dimethyl butyric acid diester of N t butyl 4 methyl norepinephrine having the structureEMI1.2 has been reported in British Patent No. 1,298,771 to show bronchodilator activity. For these known compounds which are reported to have anti glaucoma activity, the activity is weak at low concentrations and is of relatively short duration at such concentrations. Some antiglaucoma drugs tend to give an initial increase in the intraocular pressure after administration,While this increase is usually fleeting, it is an undesirable effect for individuals having glaucoma. Other undesirable effects of known anti glaucoma drugs are mydriasis the dilation of the pupil, and contralateral activity, i.e., the reduction of the intraocular pressure of the eye which is not being treated with the drug. This is an indication of a systemic effect which is usually accompanied by side effects such as tachycardia. It has now been found that the topical administration to a glaucomatous eye of a substituted alkyl diester of epinephrine or an alkyl derivative thereof, preferably as a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable, non toxic acid addition salt thereof, will result in a significant reduction, i.e., of the order t6 about 5 to 7 mm., in the intraocular pressure of the glaucomatous eye for a period of about 24 hours. This reduction in the intraocular pressure over the 24 hour period occurs at concentrations of about .05 to 0.10 percent by weight. At similar concentrations the dipivalyl ester of epinephrine provides lower reductions over a period of only five 5 hours while the 3,3 dimethylbutyric acid di ester of N t buty a methyl norepinephrine provides still lower reductions for a period of only 3.5 hours. The novel esters of the present invention exhibit activity at concentrations as low as 0.005 and 0.001 percent.The above mentioned known esters exhibit no activity at these concentrations. The new products of the present invention are prepared by reduction of the corresponding keto compound EMI3.1 to produce compounds in which R2 is hydrogen. Alternatively, compounds in which R2 is methyl or ethyl can be produced by reaction of the keto carbonyl group of the aforesaid keto compounds to form the requisite secondary alcohol group,.This is accomplished by reaction of methyl or ethyl magnesium halide or equivalent reagents known to react with carbonyl groups to form secondary alcohols. If desired, the present new compounds can also be prepared by acylating compounds of the following structure EMI3.2 with an acylating derivative of an acid of the formula EMI3.3 The aforesaid reduction process, i.e. reduction of a carbonyl group to a secondary alcohol group, can be accomplished by any of the methods commonly employed for such conversions including chemical reduction, e.g. active metals and mineral acids such as zinc or tin and hydrochloric acid, or using catalytic reduction, e.g. hydrogen gas over metal catalysts such as palladium and nickel. If desired, metal hydrides such as metal aluminum hydrides and borohydrides can also be used.Usually, for commercial production, catalytic reduction is preferred particularly employing several atmospheres of pressure of hydrogen gas over noble metal catalysts such as palladium or platinum, usually on a catalyst such as carbon. Reaction of the carbonyl compound with Grignard reagents, e.gp ethyl magnesium chloride and methyl magnesium bromide, is accomplished using known methods. The Grignard reagent need merely to be contacted with the carbonyl compound for reaction to occur. The aforesaid reactions are conveniently carried out in the presence of a solvent for the reactants. Such sovlents include, for example, ester solvents such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate, N,N dialkyl amides such as dimethyl formamide and diethyl acetamide, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetic acid, methylene achloride, ethylene chloride, and similar such solvents. The aforesaid acylation reaction can be carried out using known derivatives of the said acids, including for example acyl halides, anhydrides, mixed anhydrides, lower alkyl esters, and the free acids in the presence of for example, carbodiimides and carbonyl diimidazoles, and the like. The said reactions will occur at room temperature and even lower to about OOC. The use of elevated temperatures is for convenience in that it permits somewhat shortened reaction periods. Temperatures ranging from 0 C up to the reflux temperature of the reaction system can be used. Where hydrogen halide is involved as a reaction product, it is convenient to use hydrogen halide acceptors, e.g. tertiary organic amines e.g. trimethylamine, pyridine, picolines and the like. The present new compounds are also preparabie by the reaction of the corresponding epoxide of the formula EMI5.1 with an amine CH3NH2 to form the hydroxyl amine under known reaction conditions, which preferably utilize a solvent as described hereinbefore. The invention will be illustrated in the examples which follow. These examples are given by way of illustration and are not to be considered limiting.
