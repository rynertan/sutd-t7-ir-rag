## Description
Our invention relates to a method using fermentation techniques to produce and recover certain naturally occurring esters found to be useful for their organoleptic properties in augmenting or enhancing the aroma or taste of consumable materials such as foodstuffs, chewing gums, toothpastes, medicinal products, chewing tobaccos, smoking tobaccos, perfume compositions, colognes and perfumed articles, e.g., solid or liquid anionic, cationic, nonionic or zwitterionic detergents, perfumed polymers, fabric softener compositions, fabric softener articles, cosmetic powders, hair preparations and the like which esters are defined according to the structure wherein R₁, R₂ and R₃ each represent hydrogen or methyl R represents C₂ C₅ lower alkyl and the dashed line represents a carbon carbon single bond or a carbon carbon double bond with the proviso that at least one of R₁, R₂ and R₃ represents methyl. These esters are produced by means of a fermentation reaction of amino acids defined according to the structure with a C₂ C₅ lower alkanol according to the reaction wherein R is the see as R . Of course, the mixtures resulting from the fermentation contain a number of esters in addition to those defined according to the structure as will become evident from the detailed description of the invention and the examples set forth, infra. The reaction is effected as a result of the presence in the reaction mass of certain organisms, for example The reaction takes place by bubbling air through the fermenter which contains one or a mixture of the amino acids defined according to the structure for example, L leucine, L isoleucine or L valine and carbon sources such as The concentration range of the amino acid or a mixture of amino acids may vary in the fermenter from about 0.1 by weight of the total contents of the fermenter up to about 1.0 by weight. The concentration of carbon source in the fermenter based on the weight of total contents of the fermenter is from about 0.5 up to about 8.0 . Other substrates which may be employed are An important aspect of our invention is in the recovery of the ester reaction product defined according to the structure as it is produced in the fermentation process, to wit The air that is passed through the fermentation broth during the fermentation, picks up these esters defined according to the structure and other useful esters as will become apparent from the detailed description of the invention and the examples, infra. This air stream containing the esters is then passed through a filter then a condenser and the cooled air containing the esters is then passed through one or more charcoal beds which pick up the esters defined according to the structure as well as other useful esters. When saturated or when near saturation, the charcoal is removed from the containers holding the charcoal beds and admixed with a suitable liquid distillation material. The mixture of charcoal and the distillation material is placed, separately or simultaneously into a vessel which is then fitted with a distillation column and overhead condenser. Distillation is carried out whereby the esters are recovered from the resulting charcoal distillation liquid ester mixture. The resulting ester mixture can be further refined by means of further fractional distillation and or by means of preparative GLC. Among the various useful naturally occurring esters produced according to the process of our invention are Apparatus useful for the present invention typically comprises at least the elements described in claims 3 and 4.
