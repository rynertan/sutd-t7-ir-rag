# A method for reducing sharkskin melt fracture during extrusion of ethylene polymers.

## Abstract
A method for reducing sharkskin melt fracture during extrusion of a molten narrow molecular weight distribution linear ethylene polymer which comprises extruding said polymer through a die having a die gap greater than about 50 mils and wherein at least a portion of one surface of the die lip and or die land in contact with the molten polymer ist at an angle of divergence or convergence relative to the axis of flow of the molten polymer through the die.
