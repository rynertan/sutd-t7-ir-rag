# Method and an apparatus for controlling A.C. rotating machinery power plants.

## Abstract
The control of a quantity voltage, phase relating to a generator motor pair in an electric power station is accom plished by generating a pulse sequence associated to the quantity to be controlled and a predetermined reference pulse sequence and detecting the relative phase shift. This phase shift, or an integrated value of a number of successive phase shifts, controls a double ramp generator the sign and slope of which are proportional to the detected phase shift. After integrating such signal is employed to vary the magnetic induction of the rotor to balance the system again.
