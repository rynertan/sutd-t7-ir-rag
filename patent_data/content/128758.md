## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN VEHICLE DISC BPAKES OF THE LIQUID COOLED TYPE This invention relates to improvements in vehicle disc brakes of the liquid cooled type, of the kind in which at least one friction braking member carrying a lining of friction material is rotatable in a housing containing a cooling liquid for cooling the braking member, and actuating means is provided for urging the braking member into engagement with a relatively stationary braking surface to apply the brake. When disc brakes of the kind set forth are used with certain types of vehicles, for example agricultural type vehicles, there is often a need to accommodate high levels of energy and power. In order to accommodate such high levels it is desirable to make the effective area of the lining materal as large as possible. Increasing the effective area of the lining material will reduce the contact pressure, increase the lining volume, and reduce the power and energy per unit of rubbed area, thereby reducing the braking path temperatures and the wear rate of the lining material.However, such a substantial increase in the area of the lining material can cause a deterioration in the flow of liquid around and across the braking faces such that the temperature can peak at the centre of the braking path to a point where a breakdown in the wetted area can cause rapid wear and disintegration of the lining material. According to our invention in a disc brake of the kind set forth the lining of friction material is separated into annular rings by at least one annular groove which acts as a reservoir for cooling liquid, and throttling means are provided for throttling the flow of liquid across the braking faces of the rings. The reservoir ensures adequate circulation of liquid across the braking faces of the rings during brake application, and the throttling means resists the centrifugal effect which otherwise might cause dissipation of the flow of liquid across the braking faces with inherent loss of cooling. Our arrangement maintains the lining friction level, and provides more equal work distribution across the braking face. We can therefore increase the effective area of the lining material substantially in comparison with conventional friction braking members of similar type, whilst ensuring that the braking faces of the lining material are adequately cooled by liquid. This enables the brake to accommodate higher levels of energy and power and maintain substantially even wear of the lining material. When the brake is of the multi plate type comprising sets of relatively stationary and rotatable friction braking members alternatively interposed within a common housing, the stationary members comprise planar metal plates, and each rotatable member comprises a metal plate provided on opposite sides with lining material separated into annular rings by at least one groove, and throttling means for throttling the flow of liquid across the braking faces of the rings, the liquid reservoirs on opposite sides of each rotatable friction member will add to the cooling effects since each reservoir has a specific heat substantially five times greater than that of the intermediate stationary plates. When the actuating means comprises an expander comprising a pair of pressure plates which are disposed between a pair of adjacent rotatable friction members, and balls located in angularly spaced recesses in adjacent faces of the pressure plates, relative angular movement between the pressure spaces causes the balls to ride up ramps defined by the walls of the recesses thereby urging the pressure plates axially away from each other to clamp the braking members into frictional engagement, each groove in each rotatable friction member is substantially coincident with the pitch circle of the recesses in which the balls are located. This increases the degree of cooling in the regions of the thinner metal section at the base of the recesses for the balls, thereby reducing the likelihood of hot spotting occurring in such regions. The throttling means and the replenishment of the liquid in the annular grooves can be provided either by the natural porosity of the lining material itself or by providing flow grooves in at least the innermost annular ring. Such flow grooves may be radial and when provided in more than one ring may be offset circumferentially from each other to promote a degree of circumferential flow around the annular grooves by providing an increased throttling effect in a similar manner to that achieved when flow grooves are omitted from the outermost ring.Alternatively the flow grooves in a quadrant of the braking member are parallel to each other, with the grooves in adjacent quadrants being mutually at right angles. In such a construction the grooves may extend through both rings of lining material, with at least some of those in adjacent quadrants intersecting in the inner ring to form a matrix. The flow grooves may extend into the material of the metal ring which carries the lining material, and the flow grooves may be superimposed in the linings on opposite sides of the braking member, with the flow grooves also passing through the material of the metal ring. For example the flow grooves may comprise elongate notches which may extend inwardly from the peripheral edge of the member and traverse at least the outermost annular lining ring, or such elongate grooves may comprise openings which traverse the innermost annular lining ring and the annular groove which acts as the reservoir, or the innermost lining ring, the reservoir groove, and a part of the outermost ring. The linings may be constructed from any conventional organic or inorganic material. For example the linings may be constructed by powder, moulding or felting techniques. Typically powder is applied to sintered material, moulding to resin and fibre, and felting to paper. Conventional sintered material has a relatively low coefficient of friction ill and is relatively noisy in operation, whereas organic material has a relatively high p and is quieter in operation as compared with sintered material. The wear characteristics of organic material may not be as good as those of sintered material for a given area, at least when subjected to relatively high brake energy and power and such materials, when dry, can fatigue and de laminate. The increase in the effective overall frictional braking area enables us to provide a multi plate disc brake of increased energy and power capacity. Alternatively the brake can utilise fewer braking members which reduces the overall cost of the brake and compacts the assembly, at least axially. The intermediate stationary plates are normally slotted to avoid coning so that the linings will engage frictionally with slotted faces. When the linings comprise paper or resin graphite any tendency for the paper or resin to fatigue as a result of being worked in and out of the slots in the stationary plates is reduced substantially by the relatively increased effective area of the lining. For example the internal radial dimension of the innermost ring can be increased to match the internal radial dimension of the stationary plate, reducing the contact pressure or even eliminating the need for providing slots in the stationary plates. Some embodiments of our invention are illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a plan of a self energising brake of the oil immersed multi plate type Figure 2 is a section on the line 2 2 of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a plan of a rotatable braking member for the brake illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 Figure 4 is an end view of the same Figure 5 is a section through an actuator for the brake Figure 6 is a plan of another rotatable member, Figure 7 is an end view of the member Figure 8 is a section on the line 8 8 of Figure 6 Figure 9 is a section on the line 9 9 of Figure 6 Figure 10 is a plan of yet another rotatable member Figure 11 is a plan of yet another rotatable member and Figure 12 is a graph showing the relative cooling effects between a known friction member of an oil immersed brake of the multi plate type and a friction member of the present invention. An oil immersed brake of the multi plate type illustrated in Figures 1 to 5 of the drawings comprises sets of relatively stationary and rotatable friction braking members 1 and 2 which are alternatively interposed within a common housing 3 through which cooling oil is circulated. All the braking members 1, 2 comprise annular discs of which the stationary members are keyed to the housing 3 at their outer peripheral edges for relative sliding movement, and the rotatable members 2 are slidably splined to a shaft to be braked. Each stationary member 1 comprises a planar steel plate which may be slotted to prevent coning, and each rotatable member 2 comprises a steel plate 4 provided on opposite sides with linings 5 of friction material. The peripheral edges of linings 5 may be displaced radially inwards slightly with respect to the peripheral edge of the plate 4. An actuator assembly 6 is disposed between a pair of adjacent rotatable members 2, for example replacing a stationary plate. The actuator assembly 6 comprises a pair of pressure plates 7, 8 which are centered on pilots 9 in the housing and are provided in adjacent faces with angularly spaced recesses 10 in complementary pairs of which balls 11 are housed. A pull rod 12 is coupled to the inner ends of a pair of toggle links 13, 14 of which the outer ends are coupled to respective radial lugs 15, 16 on the two pressure plates 7 and 8. The application of the brake is initiated by the pull rod 12 which withdraws the toggle links 13, 14 to move the pressure plates 7, 8 angularly in the housing 3 in opposite directions. This causes the pressure plates 7 and 8 to separate axially by the balls 11 running up ramps defined by the walls of the recesses 10.This tends to clamp the two sets of friction members 1, 2 together, and the engagement of the pressure plates 7, 8 with the rotatable members 2 causes the two pressure plates 7, 8 to be carried round with the members 2 until the movement of one of them is arrested by a stop abutment in the housing 3, suitably defined by the engagement with a lug 17, 18 on that plate with a respective pilot 9. The other plate continues to be carried round with a servo or self energising action which increases the separation of the pressure plates 7, 8 to enhance the braking force. Each lining 5 comprises a ring of friction material, for example of conventional sintered material, but preferably of an organic material, suitably paper or resin graphite. The ring 5 is separated into inner and outer annular rings 20, 21 by means of a circumferentially extending groove 22 which acts as a reservoir for oil to ensure that the interengaging braking faces of stationary and rotatable friction members are adequately wetted, and therefore adequately cooled, when the brake is applied. As illustrated the groove 22 is formed in the lining 5 itself but, in a modification, the groove 22 may define a space between two separate concentric rings of friction material. The groove 22 is substantially coincident with the pitch circle diameter of the recesses 10 in which the balls 11 are located. This increases the degree of cooling in the regions of the thinner metal sections of the pressure plates 7 and 8, thereby reducing the likelihood of hot or blue spotting occuring in such regions. The linings 5 are provided with means for replenishing the reservoirs and with throttling means to resist the centrifugal effect which might otherwise cause dissipation of the flow of liquid across the braking faces with inherent loss of cooling. Various arrangements of such replenishment and throttling means are illustrated in Figure 3 of the drawings, with a different arrangement illustrated in each quadrant 23, 24, 25 and 26 of the friction member. Depending upon the nature of the material comprising the friction lining and the effective area of the rings 20, 21, satisfactory replenishment of the reservoir and throttling can be achieved by the natural porosity of the material itself. This is illustrated in quadrant 23. As shown in quadrant 25 the inner ring 20 may be provided with angularly spaced straight radial flow grooves 27 to ensure adequate replenishment of the reservoir, with throttling means for the outer ring 21 being defined by the porosity of the lining material. In the construction shown in quadrant 26 both rings are provided with radial flow grooves 28 and 29 respectively which are substantially radial. The grooves 28 and 29 may be aligned at adjacent ends, or they may be relatively displaced circumferentially to increase the throttling effect. As illustrated, the grooves 28 and 29 may be straight but, in modifications, they may be eccentrically or spirally arranged As shown in quadrant 24 the grooves 28 and 29 are aligned at adjacent ends, but are curved slightly in the same direction to increase the rate of flow across the braking face. In any of the constructions of quadrants 24, 25 and 26, the radial grooves may extend into the metal plate 4 itself. In another construction the grooves on opposite sides of the plate are superimposed upon each other, and may also be interconnected by complementary grooves extending through the metal plate 4 itself. In the rotatable braking member shown in Figures 6 to 9, five radial notches 30, which are equi spaced angularly, extend inwardly from the peripheral edge of the member 2 through the plate 4 and both linings 5, to a position spaced inwardly from the inner peripheral edge of the ring 20. The linings 5 are provided with flow groove patterns comprising four grooves 31 which are angularly spaced and extend generally radially, and with pairs of grooves 32, of which each pair is located, and spaced angularly, between adjacent pairs of the grooves 31. The grooves 32 of each pair diverge outwardly to the peripheral edges of the linings 5. The pattern of the flow grooves 31 and 32 in one of the linings 5 is superimposed upon the pattern in the other although, in a modification, the two patterns may be displaced from each other. All the flow grooves 30, 31, and 32 traverse both rings 20 and 21 but are not as deep as the circumferentially extending groove 22 which acts as the reservoir. The peripheral edges of the outer rings 21 are slightly inset radially from the peripheral edges of the metal plate 4. The construction of the braking member of Figures 6 to 9 is otherwise the same as that of Figures 3 to 5 and corresponding reference numerals have been applied to corresponding parts. In the braking member of Figure 10 the notches 30 are replaced by five notches 34 of which the circumferential width is substantially less than that of the notches 30, and the notches 34, at their inner ends, only extend radially through the plate 4 and the rings 21 for distances terminating short of the groove 22. The braking member 2 is provided with a further set of five grooves 35 which are alternately displaced between, and equi angularly with respect to, the notches 34. The grooves 35 are in the form of angularly spaced, radially extending, openings, which pass through the material of both the linings 5 and the plate 4, traverse the ring 20, and terminate at their outer ends in the groove 22 and at their inner ends at a position displaced by a substantial distance from the inner peripheral edge of the ring 20. The openings 35 are substantially of similar circumferential width to that of the notches 30 in the braking member of Figures 6 to 9. The linings 5 are provided with groove patterns similar to those of the braking member of Figures 6 to 9 with respect to which corresponding reference numerals have been applied to corresponding parts. In the braking member of Figure 9 the notches 34 are omitted and the openings 35 are extended radially outwards to project radially into the rings 21 for substantially two thirds of the radial width of the rings 21. The linings 5 are provided with a different pattern of flow grooves. As illustrated spaced parallel flow grooves 40 are provided in each quadrant of the braking member, and the grooves 40 in adjacent quadrants are mutually at right angles to each other. All the grooves 40 extend between the inner and outer peripheral edges of the linings 5, with the grooves 40 traversing the annular groove 22 and both rings 20 and 21. The grooves 40 in adjacent quadrants of the innermost ring 20 intersect to form matrixes 41, 42, 43 and 44. The grooves 40 are shallower than the groove 22. In the construction of Figure 11 the radial extension of the openings 35 increases the flow of liquid across the braking forces and between opposite faces of the rotatable member 2, thereby increasing the cooling effect, and the arrangement of the grooves 40 provides a substantially even flow across the braking faces. As in other constructions described above, the pattern of flow grooves is superimposed in the linings 5 on opposite sides of the plate 4. The construction of the braking member of Figure 11 is otherwise the same as that of Figure 10 and corresponding reference numerals have been applied to coresponding parts. The graph of Figure 12 compares the braking face temperature for a given area of friction lining between a lining comprising a conventional single annular ring, and that of the present invention comprising two or more annular rings separated by groove defining respective reservoirs for oil. It will be observed that the braking face temperature of the conventional single ring rises significantly towards the centre of the face indicating inadequate liquid cooling. This, will cause rapid wear of the lining material, for example fatigue and delamination in construction in which the lining is of paper. In the construction of the present invention incorporating at least two annular rings, it will be seen that a more even braking face temperature is achieved across the whole of the face indicating adequate and more even cooling.
