# Hydrogel contact lenses for extended wear.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for the preparation of hydrogel contact lenses having improved mechanical properties, said process comprising polymerizing, in the presence of an azo type initiator, a monomer mixture comprising from 25 to 50 by weight of N vinyl pyrrolidone, up to 5 by weight of methacrylic or acrylic acid, 0.1 to 1 by weight of 1,3,5 tris propenoxy 2,4,6 triazine TPT , or perhydro 2,4,6, triketo 1,3,5, tris propene 2 1,3,5 triazine TTPT , as a cross linking monomer, the balance being essentially hyd roxy alkyl acrylate or methacrylate, wherein the alkyl group is ethyl or propyl.
