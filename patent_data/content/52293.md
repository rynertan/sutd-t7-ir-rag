# Rotary drive coupling.

## Abstract
A flexible coupling 20 for drivingly connecting two rotatable shafts 24,28 or the like, and for use in applications where torque is transmitted only in one direction of rotation or where the torque transmitted in one direction of rotation is significantly greater than the torque transmitted in the other direction of rotation, includes a flex member 30 consisting of four elongated flex elements 36,37,38,39 joined together in a rectangular arrangement. The two elements positioned on opposite sides of the rectangular arrangement are of substantially rectangular cross sectional shape along a ma jor portion of element length, and the elements of one such pair 36,38 are thicker than the elements of the other pair 37,39 . The flex member 30 is connected between the two rotatable shafts 24,28 in a manner which causes the thicker elements 36,38 to be in compression and the thinner elements 37,39 to be in tension during torque transmission in the favored direction. The difference in element thickness provides a more stable flex member 30 structure, reducing unwanted spurious defections and thereby improving the capacity for useful deflections associated with driving and driven member misalignments. The coupling may include only a single flex member 30 or may have a number of such members connected in series 59 to increase its misalign ment capabilities.
