# Remotely actuated metal disintegration machine apparatus.

## Abstract
A metal disintegration apparatus 10 for performing machining work using an electrode 30 on a portion of a workpiece P in a confined inaccessible location includes electrode means 30 , electrode holder means 32 for movably holding the electrode means 30 and elongated means 34 for positioning and supporting the electrode holder means 32 at a desired remote location. Vibration feed means 20 are coupled to the electrode means so that the electrode 30 can be vibrated relative to the electrode holder means 32 and advanced so that the electrode 30 can perform arc machining. The vibration feed means 20 is located at a location remote from the electrode means 30 the metal disintegration apparatus 10 is ideally suited for work at inaccessible locations such as those encountered in steam generators of nuclear reactors.
