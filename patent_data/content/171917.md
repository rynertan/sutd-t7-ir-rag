# Transparent polarizing laminated glasses.

## Abstract
This invention concerns an improved process for fabri cating transparent laminated polarizing glasses consisting of a substrate of inorganic or organic glass, a coating of polarizing properties deposited upon one surface of the substrate, and an integral, optically transparent composite film consisting, on the one hand, of one lamina of thermo plastic polyurethane of adhesive properties, and, on the other hand, of one lamina of thermosetting polyurethane of anti lacerative and self regenerating properties the thermo plastic polyurethane ply adhering to the polarizing coating. This process comprises applying the polarizing coating to the substrate, then treating at least the coated surface of the substrate with a aqueous solution containing γ aminopropyltrimethoxysilane or γ aminopropyl triethoxysilane, and thereafter applying said composite film.
