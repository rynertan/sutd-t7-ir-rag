# Orange juice concentrate and process of making thereof.

## Abstract
A natural orange juice concentrate prepared from natu ral orange compounds is disclosed. The orange juice concen trate has at least 35 solids including pulp, non volatile compounds, pectin and volatile compounds. This orange juice concentrate has at least 65 of the aroma and flavor volatile compounds of the natural juice. The aroma and flavor volatile compounds comprise a low boiling fraction and a higher boiling fraction in a ratio of at least 4 1. The ethyl butyrate level is at least .1 of the total volatile compounds, the proportion of ethyl butyrate to limonene being in the range of .0015 1 to about 0.6 1. The orange juice concentrate is prepared by separating natural orange juice into a pulp portion and a serum portion. The serum portion which comprises 7 to 20 solids and from 80 to 93 water is concentrated by removing essentially pure water. The concentration step can be acomplished by freeze concentration or by sublimation concentration. When sublimation concentration is used, the pulp does not have to be separated from the serum. Substantially 100 of the non volatile solids are retained. Moreover, the product is substantially free of oxidative degradation products.
