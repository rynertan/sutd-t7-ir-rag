# Coil placing device and method of conversion thereof.

## Abstract
A device for placing prewound coils and insulating wedges into slots of dynamoelectric machine stator cores in the manufacture of electric motors has a wedge making apparatus including a drive, a mechanism 35, 77 for cutting insulating wedges from a strip 27 of insulating material, and mechanism 39 for forming the wedges 19, 21 into a magazine 11 for subsequent insertion into stator core slots 15 . To enable the device to be quickly converted from operation on a stator core of one configuration to operation on a stator core of different configuration without removing any bolts from the device, the wedge making apparatus actuating arrangement includes an elongated bipartite mate rial cut off drive bar 79, 81 for coupling the drive to the cutting arrangement 35, 77 an elongated bipartite wedge forming drive bar 83, 85 coupling the drive to the arrange ment 39 for forming the wedges into the magazine 11 . Both the bipartite drive bars are separable into two parts to allow removal of the cutting and forming arrangements from the device without disturbing the drive. To this end, each bipartite drive bar includes a clamping bolt 87, 95 received in an open ended slot of one bipartite part 81, 85 so that the bars are readily separable by merely loosening the bolts. A readily separable mechanism for indexing the magazine 11 may also be provided so that the magazine and cutting and forming arrangements may be removed from the device and replaced by different parts adapted to a stator core of a different configuration with minimal difficulty.
