## Description
Specification Method of Preparing Albumin Rich Foodstuff Raw MaterialsTechnical fieldThis invention relates to a method of preparing albumin rich foodstuff raw material consisting essentially of beans, seaweeds, algae or other vegetable albumin rich substances and not containing salt.Background of the inventionLike meat, as a source of animal albumin, beans, seaweeds, algae, etc. are important foodstuffs as a source of supplying vegetable albumin to human bodies. Miso , a product of soya beans is an important foodstuff for Japanese. However, due to recent change in social life, especially due to decrease in hard labor, the quantity of salt requested by human bodies is now decreasing. Too much salt affects the health causing high blood pressure, kidney dislase, etc. so that it is necessary to limit the quantity of salt taken into human bodies. For this reason, it has been tried to develop foodstuffs containing no or only little salt.Prior artIn a paper of H. Iwashita et al of Miso Technique No. 86 issued on April 16, 1961 is disclosed a method in which a mixture of boiled or steamed soya beans and rice malt is maintained at a temperature of from 45 to 550C for 24 36 hours, then 3 5 by weight of 95 ethyl alcohol is in 0 corporated at a temperature of about 40 C. Thereafter, the mixture ist let stand still at room temperature for about one week to improve flavor and taste and to age the mixture. BAen miso is prepared according to this method, acidification caused by usual live fungus, for example lactic acid bacilli and aerotropic decomposive bacteria can be prevented by temperature control. However such control device is bulky and expensive. Furthermore, according to this method, the mixture of the boiled or steamed soya beans and the rice malt is semisolid, and moreover since the quantity of ethyl alcohol incorporated is extremely small, not only the mixing step is difficult to perform but also it is almost impossible to obtain a homogeneous mixture.Japanese laid open patent specification No. 48498 of 1976 discloses a method of preparing soya bean miso ih which all or a portion of the salt incorporated into a mixture of steamed or boiled soya beans is substituted by less than 100 by volume or preferably less than 5 by volume of alcohol fo the purpose of preparing soya bean miso not containing or containing but a small quantity of salt. Although this method is more advantageous than the first mentioned method in that there is no difficulty of temperature control and incorporation of alcohol, where rice malt or wheat malt is used, substitution of alcohol of less than 5 by volume makes it difficult to suppress the adverse effect of the lactic acid bacilli or the like thus resulting in acidification. Consequently it is difficult to determine the optimum aging interval.Even wehen the quantity of alcohol is increased beyond 5 by volume it is impossible to sufficiently suppress the adverse effect of the lactic acid bacilli, etc. When the quantity of alcohol approaches 10 by volume the flavor of alcohol becomes remarkable thus degrading the quality of the product.Aim of the inventionAccordingly, it is the principal object of this invention to provide a novel method of preparing albumin rich foodstuff raw material not containing salt which is inexpensive and can be used for a number of purposes.Object of the inventionWe have found that the difficulties of the prior art methods can be eliminated by a novel method comprising the steps of immersing malt in ethyl alcohol or an aqueous solution thereof or incorporating ethyl alcohol or an aqueous solution thereof into malt to sterilize the same, then incorporating boiled or steamed vegetable albumin rich substances such as beans, seaweeds and algae and finally aging the mixture. The semisolid, paste like or ricegruel like albimin rich foodstuff raw material prepared by this method can be pulverized after drying.According to the present invention, albumin rich foodstuff raw materials are made from grain malts and vegetablealbumin rich substances such as beans, seaweeds, algae, etc.As beans soya beans, adzuki beans, kidney beans, peas, cowpeas, fava beans, winged beans, etc. can be used.As seaweeds, several kinds of lavers can be used.As algae, chlorella, spirulina and so on can be used.Grain malt is sterilized by ethyl alcohol or its solution.The ethyl alcohol utilized in this invention is a commercially available alcohol suitable to be added to foodstuffs, and the aqueous solution of the alcohol is prepared by di luting it with water suitable for drink.The concentration of the aqueous solution of alcohol suitable for the method of this invention is that of 15 2 alcohol containing remaining fungus of about 2 to 4 as shown in the following Table I.

Especially, where a 75 alcohol aqueous solution is used no deactivation was noted as shown by the result of experiment shown in the followingTable II.

It is advantageous to admix the malt with albumin rich substances after taking out the malt from alcohol or an aqueous solution thereof.Where alcohol or its aqueous solution is incorporated into the malt it is advantageous to admix it with albumin rich substances after sterilization without separating alcohol.It is advantageous to mix together sterilized malt and steamed or boiled albumin rich substances at a temperature of from 300C to 400C.The malt utilized in this invention is selected from the group consisting of rice malt, wheat malt, bean malt and malts of albumious substances depending upon the intended use of the albumin rich foodstuffs raw material free from salt.It is especially advantageous to add additional quantity of alcohol when malt treated with alcohol is admixed with the boiled or steamed albumin rich substances.Advantageously, the quantity of incorporation of ethyl alcohol or an aqueous solution thereof should be less than 5 by weight based on the sum of the weight of the albumin rich substances and the malt in terms of the total alcohol concentration.In practice, it is advantageous to perform the aging step of this invention at a temperature between 200C and 500C, preferably between 300C and 400C. Although the aging period is determined depending upon the aging temperature and the quantity of the malt used but a concrete aging period should be determined in accordance with the intended use of the resulting foodstuff. When one considers the percentage of decomposition, more than one week or at least 10 days is sufficient.The albumin rich foodstuff raw material of this invention obtained after aging can be used in many fields of application. For example, the foodstuff raw material in the form of a semisolid, a paste or a rice gruel can be suitably added to an ordinary miso to prepare miso containing a small quantity of salt, or to prepare a raw material of mayonnaise and sauce. It can also be used to prepare a spread by admixing it with butter or cheese or as raw materials to prepare soup, confectionary, bread, biscuit, etc.To have better understanding of the invention some typical examples of the method of this invention will now be de scribed as follows.Example 1.60 Kg of rice malt dried for 20 hours at room temperature and having a water content of 20 was dipped for 30 minutes in 6 1 of 93.5 ethyl alcohol suitable for incorporation into foodstuffs . Then, the malt was taken out of the alcohol at which time the alcohol content of the malt was about 20 by weight. 40 kg of soya beans which have been cooled to a temperature of about 45 c after boiling or steamed was put into a stainless container having a capacity of 200 1 and equipped with an agitator. After adding 1.1 Kg of the ethyl alcohol the mixture in the container was admixed. At the end of this step, the temperature of the mixture was 400C. Thereafter the mixture was transferred into a polyvinyl chloride container having a capacity of 80 1, and maintained in a constant temperature room to effect aging. The alcohol content, holmol nitrogen content, pH value, color, etc. of the aged mixture were tested and its various characteristics were also tested respectively at 0, 5, 10 and 20th days after initiating the aging step and the results are shown in the following Table III The control example a was prepared in the same manner as this example 1 except that the rice malt was not sterilized by immersing it in alcohol but 2.5 Kg of the alcohol was added at the commencement of the aging see Japanese laid open patent specification No. 48 498 1976 referred to above .Example 2.The same process as in Example 1 was repeated except that the temperature of the boiled or steamed soya beans was changed to about 35 C ant that the temperature of the constant temperature room was held at 30 C during the aging.The temperature of the contents in the aging container was 300C. The same test and measutement as in Example 1 were made and results are also shown in Table III in which the control examples were prepared in the same manner as the control example a .

Both samples 1 and 2 showed favorable aging characteristics. Especially the sample 1 showed excellent taste at 20th day. Although sample 1 was not yet completely aged at 10th day but at 20th day it showed stable taste and excellent color.As above described in the cases of control samples a and b it was considered that live acid fungus became active regardless of the mixing temperature and the aging temperature. In the samples 1 and 2 of this invention it is to be noted that no acidification has occurred under the same temperature condition.In samples 1 and 2 the amount of the holmol nitrogen were respectively 0P67 and 0.65 S after aging for 20 days.Which shows that the percentage of decomposition of albumin ist high when one considers the fact that the quantity of the holmol nitrogen of ordinary miso is about 0.45 . The albumin rich foodstuff raw material prepared by the process of Example 1 and not containing any salt was analyzed and found to have the following nutrient compositions a vitamine B1 0.17 mg , vitamine B2 0.22 mg , water content 1.5 measured by drying method under a reduced pressure , albumin 31.8 coefficient 5.71 , oil 17.9 Soxhlet extraction method , fiber 4.0 , ash 3.5 , sugar 41.5 , salt as NaCl 68.9 mg , calcium 257 mg b 100 g of a powder of the albumin rich foodstuff raw material not containing salt was used. Its calorie value 445 was calculated based on the following values albumin 3.47, oil 8.37, fiber and sugar 4.07.Example 3.3 Kg of rice malt was dipped for one hour in 3 1 of 93.5 alcohol which was suitable to prepare foodstuffs and then taken out of the alcohol. The alcohol content of the malt thus treated was about 20 by weight. 15 Kg of soya beans which have been cooled to 35 0C after boiling or steaming was put in a steel container having a volume of 100 1 and provided with an agitator together with the malt dipped in alcohol and mixed together, The temperature of the mixture at the start of the mixing operation was 30 c.After completion of the mixing operation the mixture was transferred into a polyvinyl chloride container having a volume of 20 1 and maintained in a constant temperature room held at 300C thus causing the mixture to age. The water content, pH value, alcohol content, color, number of live funguses, the percentage of dissolved nitrogen, the percentage of nitrogen decomposition of the aged mixture were measured and its various characteristics were also determined at 0th, 4th, 11th, 20th and 37th days and the results are shown in the following Table IV.Example 4.The same process steps as in Example 3 were repeated except that 0.3 1 of 93.5 alcohol was added at the time of admixing. The results of measurement regarding aged material are also shown in Table IV. Example 5.Again the process steps of Example 3 were repeated except that 0.2 1 of 93.5 alcohol was added to the boiled or steamed soya beans and that 0.3 1 of 93.5 alcohol was incorporated at the time of mixing and the results are also shown in the same table.Example 6.1.0 1 of 93.5 20 alcohol was sprinkled on 3 Keg of rice malt and admixed therewith. After standstill for 30 minutes.15 Kg of soya beans which have been boiled or steamed and then cooled to a temperature of about 35 C put in a steel container provided with an agitator and having a capacity of 100 1, and then the rice malt was added and admixed with the soya beans. The aged product was tested in the same manner as in Example 3 and the results are shown in the following Table IV.Control sample C The process steps of Example 3 were repeated except that the alcohol treatment of the rice malt was not performed and that 1.0 1 of 93.5 alcohol was incorporated at the time of admixing the ingredients.

In addition, the control example C was completely acidified at the 11th day of the aging but in theExamples 3 6 of this invention the mixture was aged satisfactory.About 25 of nitrogen decomposition is sufficient but it is considered that this value could be increased with larger aging days.Example 7.4 Kg of rice malt was dipped for one hour in 4 1 of 93.5 alcohol. Then, the malt was taken out of the alcohol at which time the alcohol content of the malt was about 20 by weight. The malt dipped in alcohol was put into a steel container having a capacity of 100 1 wherein 15 Kg of soya beans which have been cooled to a temperature of about 35 0C after boiling or steamed was put. The malt and the soya beans were admixed with an agitator. At the end of this step, the temperature of the mixture was 300C.Thereafter, the mixture was transferred into a polyvinyl chloride container having a capacity of 20 1, and maintained in a constant temperature room of 300C to effect aging.The water content, pH value, alcohol content, color, number of live funguses, holmol nitrogen content of the aged mixture were measured and its various characteristics were also tested respectively at 0, 10, 20 and 31st days after initiating the aging step. The results are shown in theTable V. Example 8.The same process as in Example 7 was repeated except that 15 Kg of boiled or steamed soya beans was changed to 15 Kg of boiled or steamed adzuki beans. The same test and measurement as in Example 7 were made and results are also shown in Table V.Example 9.The same process as in Example 7 was repeated except that 15 Kg of boiled or steamed soya beans was changed to 15 Kg of boiled or steamed kidney beans.

However, with recent change in taste, demand for miso is now decreasing.Among a number of reasons may be mentioned a large quantity of salt contained in miso which is not suitable for taste of some of the Japanese. An average quantity of salt taken by a Japanese is said to be 10 15 g day and one cup of miso soup contains about 2.5 g of salt. Miso contains a large quantity of albumin and amino acid necessary forJapanese. Accordingly, it is presently necessary to decrease the salt content for increasing demand. Decrease in the salt quantity of miso increase the demand therefor for condiments and for treating foodstuffs. In the prior art miso containing less than 12 x of salt ist not suitable for storage but according to this invention it is possible to freely adjust the salt concentration. Low salt content miso was prepared by admixing the prior art miso containing 12.5 by weight of salt ardthe albumin rich foodstuff raw material containing no salt prepared by Example 1 according to the formulation shown in the following Table IX.
