## Abstract
Apparatus for cooling electrochemical fuel cell system components. Periodic reversal of the direction of flow of cooling fluid through a fuel cell stack 10 provides a greater uniformity of cell operational temperatures thereby impro ving cell efficiency. Flow direction through a recirculating coolant fluid circuit 50 is reversed through a two position valve 58 , without requiring modulation of a coolant pump 56 .
