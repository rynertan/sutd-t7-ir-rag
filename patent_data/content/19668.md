## Description
CONVECTRON THERMONUCLEAR REACTOR AND PROCESS With the reduced availability of conventional sources of energy, controlled fusion has held promise of providing an economical and plentiful source of energy. This promise, however, remains unfulfilled. In spite of intensive research, no practical device for producing controlled thermonuclear fusion has yet been demonstrated. The most usual approach is to make use of externally generated magnetic and electric fields to confine a plasma within an evacuated chamber, usually a torus. Such systems were generally large and were foreseen as central power stations and, by their nature, would not be useful as a power source of limited output. Such proposed systems were intended to radiate neutrons and radiant energy which would be converted into a useable form of energy.Much work has been done on methods for making use of the energy in the neutrons and the visible radiation and such conversion apparatus forms no part of the present invention. The present invention takes a significantly different approach to the production of thermonuclear energy from those methods in the current and earlier literature. Energy is produced continuously in modestquantities from a relatively small generator in contrast with the large central generators envisioned by most of the previous research. A plasma ball is produced, by any desired means such as by a high current arc in a suitable environment, and is held in position by two jets of gas from opposing nozzles and an electrostatic field. The fuel consists of the usual fusion materials, such as a mixture of deuterium and tritium, combined with a carrier gas that does not enter into the thermonuclear reactions but acts as a medium for the imprisonment of photons that would otherwise be radiated from the plasma. My invention is based on a new model for plasma turbulence. I contend that it is possible for a plasma to assume a spherical shape as a result, at least in part, of internal magnetic fields which are generated by the plasma itself. The spherical plasma is a deep electromagnetic well with central temperatures and densities in the range of thermonuclear interest. The whole configuration behaves as a miniature star hld together by electromagnetic forces in a steady state so long as sufficient energy is generated,at the center. Two examples of such a plasma sphere are 1 ball lightning observed in the earth s atmosphere during thunderstorms and 2 circuit breaker fireballs generated during switching errors in the machine rooms of United States submarines. It is an object of my invention to provide a method and apparatus that can be incorporated into an economical and practical lowcapacity thermonuclear generator to produce continuous flow of high energy neutrons. Another object is. to provide a method and apparatus for the continuing maintenance of a plasma ball within a reaction chamber. Another object is to provide for a continuous thermonuclear reaction in a plasma tha.t is confined without requiring externallygenerated magnetic fields. Still another object is to provide for a thermonuclear reaction in a plasma that is continuously fueled by thermonuclear fuel mixed with a carrier gas that takes no direct part in the thermonuclear reaction Another object of my invention is to provide for a reaction chamber having inlet nozzles in opposing positions along a common axis of the chamber and exhaust means for continuous or intermittent removal of fusion products and unused gases. Yet another object is to provide a method and apparatus for carrying out thermonuclear reactions substantially at atmospheric pressure.. Another object is to produce fusion in a plasma sphere consisting of two counterrotating vortex rings It is an object of my invention to provide a method and appa ratus for maintaining a continuing plasma within a chamber and in a position where it does not make contact with the walls of the chamber. Still another object is to provide a method and apparatus for controlling a thermonuclear reaction by regulation of the quantity of fuel supplied to it. These and other objects will be in part apparent from and in part pointed out in the following description considered In conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Figure lA is a general perspective view of the apparatus with parts of the enclosing wall broken away to show the central plasma sphere, in which the ignition system is aligned with the center line of the reaction chamber Figure 1B shows a modification of the apparatus of Figure lA in which the ignition system lies in the equatorial plane of the reaction chamber Figure 2 is a chart showing the run of temperature vs. density inside the plasma sphere where 0 represents the outer surface, A the photospheric surface, B the sonic interface and C the center of the plasma sphere on line PQ the pressure due to molecular motion is equal to the pressure due to degenerate electrons Figure 3 represents the streamlines in a meridional cross section of the plasma sphere, in which S represents three stagnation points on the polar axis of the flow pattern, and SR indicates the stagnation ring on the equator Figure 4 is an enlarged representation of the central part ofFigure 3, in which A represents subsonic outflow in a converging duct, B supersonic outflow in a diverging duct, E supersonic inflow in a converging duct, and D subsonic flow in a diverging duct S represents the central stagnation point of the flow and the dotted line C represents the sonic interface Figure 5 is a sketch representing the electromagnetic field inside the plasma sphere, in which the equatori.al plane XOY contains the magnetic field lines and the meridional plane XOZ rontains the electric field lines Figure 6 is a sketch representing the flow pattern inside and around the plasma sphere the interior flow is a twin pair of counterrotating vortex rings centered on the polar axis Z, with inflow in the equatorial plane XOY and outflow along the polar axis Z the external flow comprises two jets symmetrical about the polar axis Z, which attach to the plasma sphere at the poles and separates from it on the equator Figure 7 is a schematic longitudinal section through the ignition system of the reactor Figure 8 is a sectional view taken along line 8 8 of Figure 7 Figure 9 is a schematic longitudinal section through a nozzle Figure 10A is a schematic, longitudinal section through a reaction chamber and auxiliary apparatus of the embodiment shown in Figure lA Figure 10B is a similar longitudinal section through the apparatus shown in Figure 1B.

A new type of thermonuclear reactor and process is conceived, which is based on a model for plasma turbulence that explains the physics of self contained energetic plasma spheres such as ball lightning and circuit breaker fireballs. Among the features that distinguish this model from contemporary theories are i convective heat flux prescribes mass flow, and ii ferromagnetic ordering in the convective plasma. The precise dependence of the flow pattern on the convective heat flux is derived from the thermodynamics of irreversible processes the resulting relation implies that a convective plasma sphere must consist of a twin pair of counterrotating vortex rings centered on their common axis of symmetry. This is a configuration which contains kinetic energy, but does not contain angular momentum when averaged over the whole sphere.The vortex motion has a singular point at the center of the sphere, where radial streamlines in the equatorial plane join and form two streamlines which go radially outward along the symmetry axis of the flow, until they meet the surface of the plasma sphere. At the north and south poles of the vor tex motion, the radial streamline branches out into meridians lying on the surface of the plasma sphere. On the equator, the surface streamlines from opposite poles join and form ingoing streamlines returning to the center of the sphere. In this way, the ttlin vortex ring configuration establishes a direct communication between the center and the surface which will be brought to advantage in the following reactor design. The flow along the polar axis resembles the flow in a Laval nozzle at the center, the fluid is at rest, as in the reservoir of aLaval nozzle the outward acceleration along the symmetry axis cools down the fluid as in the convergent part of the Laval nozzle when the fluid reaches the local speed of sound, it continues as a supersonic flow under further cooling of the fluid, provided the pressure difference between the center and the surface is sufficiently high, just as in the divergent part of the Laval nozzle. As the streamlines of the supersonic flow curve towards the equatorial plane, the reverse process begins to happen the supersonic flow decelerates to sonic velocity under heating of the fluid, and decelerates to stagnation at the center under further heating of the fluid the flow near the equatorial plane resembles the flow in a diffuser. The Laval, nozzle analogy enables one to estimate the run of pressure, temperature and density inside the plasma sphere. Going outward from the center pressure, temperature and density decrease monotonically in a way depending upon the adiabatic Index of the gas. The plasma sphere must have a strong stratification the values of pressure, temperature and density at the center are much higher than the surface values of these parameters. The precise values of the central parameters depend on the total energy content of the plasma sphere if the vortex motion contains a kinetic energy of 108 joules, the central temperature of a.plasma sp.here with a mass of a few grams must be over 107 Kelvin, which is in the range of thermonuclear interest.It may be noted that an exploding ball lightning was calculated to have an energy of 109 joules. Between the supersonic vortex flow at the surface of the plasma sphere and the atmospheric air a boundary layer must develop, across which the temperature decreases to its atmospheric value, and the density increases to its atmospheric value, and the velocity goes to subsonic values. Nar the poles and near the equator, this boundary layer is isobaric as no exeternal forces act on its material. The isobaric condition may be violated between poles and equator because of the curvature effects. As was stated earlier, the model for plasma turbulence postulates ferromagnetic ordering in the convective region of the plasma sphere. This brings about a magnetic permeability in the convective region which may be very much larger than unity. This ferromagnetic ordering causes a negative binding energy which is necessary to obtain a stable configuration. It provides an inward magnetic force which compensates the force due to the outward pressure gradient, and the inertial forces due to the curved vortex motion of the gas in the convective envelope. The magnetic field is p4rely azimuthal magnetic field lines are circles centered on the symmetry axis of the vortex flow. The magnetic field lines coincide with the vortex lines of the flow pattern, but they do not change direction on passing the equatorial plane, as do the vortex lines.The vortex lines have opposite directions in the northern and southern hemispheres, but the magnetic field lines have the same direction throughout the sphere. On the symmetry axis the azimuthal magnetic field must vanish, and no magnetic force will be present to decelerate and deflect the supersonic jets emanating from the center. This is done instead by the electric field which is generated inside the plasma as a result of the flow perpendicular to the magnetic field. This electric field is always perpendicular to the magnetic field and hence lies in meridional planes of the vortex flow. Also, the field lines are everywhere perpendicular to the streamlines. Unlike the streamlines, vortex lines and magnetic field lines, which are closed, the electric field lines may begin on positive charges and end on negative charges.Hence the convective envelope has a distribution of space charge in which the surfaces of opposite hemispheres have the opposite charge distribution the inner surface of the convective envelope also has a charge distribution which is the opposite of the charge distribution on the outer surface. The dominant multipole moment of the charge distribution as a whole is the linear octupole moment. The total charge of the plasma sphere remains zero. Because of the multipole moments of the charge distribution, the plasma sphere will experience a net force when placed in an inhomogeneous external electric field. This electric force is used in the following reactor design. to keep the plasma sphere from touching the walls of the reaction chamber. The plasma sphere is formed by first short circuiting an electrical power supply and then suddenly interrupting the current. From circuit breaker experiments on ships it has been found that the current must be over 150,000 amperes to form a fireball in atmospheric air, the voltage between the electrodes being a few hundred volts. In order to reach thermonuclear conditions at the center of the fireball, currents of about one million amperes would be sufficient. At the present time, battery banks, as present on submarines, appear to be the best power supply to generate sufficiently energetic fireballs. The conditions in the discharge and in the plasma sphere which develops from it can be controlled by means of the amount of charge in the battery bank and by varying the moment at which the short circuit current is interrupted. To get a thermonuclear reaction going at the center of the plasma sphere, the atmospheric air must be mixed with some thermonuclear fuel, of which the isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium, have the lowest ignition temperature. As these isotopes form an explosive mixture with oxygen, this element must not be present in the plasma sphere. Rather, the plasma, sphere must be predominately of a gas that does not react chemically with hydrogen or its isotopes. Nitrogen, or even more inert gases, may be used. This carrier gas is premixed with the selected thermonuclear fuel before the plasma sphere is generated. As the discharge is struck in this mixture, and thermonuclear conditions develop at the center of the plasma sphere, the fusion reaction at the center must produce just the needed amount of power to sustain the radiative output at the surface.The state of the plasma sphere will then remain the same for so long as the therm onuclear fuel is supplied to it. This is comparable to the main sequencestate of stars in which fusion of hydrogen into helium halts the gravitational contractions until all hydrogen is burned. For steady state operation, it is also necessary to remove the reaction products continuously or intermittently.The carrier gas does not participate in the reactions, but serves to make the energy transfer from the center to the surface convective. The plasma sphere could not exist if radiation or conduction were the dominant mode of heat transfer between the center and the surface. Once the plasma sphere has been formed, it is transported into the reaction chamber by the drag force of the gas flowing around it, and settles at an equilibrium position determined by the net effect of the drag forces from two gas jets coming from opposite directions and of the electrostatic field inside the reaction chamber. The equilibrium position can be adjusted by changing the strength of either jet, or by changing the potentials that cause the external field. The reaction will continue so long as the fuel concentration is kept at the proper level. As the fuel consumption in thermonuclear reactions is.very slow, diffusion will keep the fuel concentrations inside and around the plasma sphere at substantially the same level.One way to stop the reaction is to filter the fuel out of the carrier gas circulation, and to wait until the fuel concentration inside the sphere falls below the critical level. The plasma sphere will then radiate away its internal energy and recombine to neutral gas. During operation as a thermonuclear reactor, the total mass of the plasma sphere may be increased in the following way One hemisphere has a positive surface charge and the other has a negative surface charge dis tribution. If the neutral gas in the boundary layer is ionized, electrons will enter the positive hemisphere and positive ions will enter theega tive hemisphere of the plasma sphere, thereby increasing its total mass.The material of the boundary layer can be ionized by bombarding it withX rays or by approaching it with radio active material. In this way, a small, low power plasma sphere could gradually be grown into a reactor of any desired power output. Two equations describe the state of turbulence in a magnetized plasma. One relates the convective heat flux in the plasma to the vorticity of the flow pattern in the plasma. This holds only if no heat sources exist inside the layer. In this case, the heat flux has a vanishing divergence which means it has a vector potential as indicated by the Helmholtz Theorem. This vector potential of the convective heat flux q is identified as the vorticity of the fluid flow inside the turbulent plasma curl curl cq l A detailed derivation of this equation is given in my doctoral dissertation Thermally Driven Mass Flows in the Convection Zone of the Sun , which is available as report NASA CR 136505, or as Microfilm No. N74 1542 fromUniversity Microfilms.The basic idea underlying Equation 1 is the expanding sphere model for turbulent fluids. This turbulence model introduces a rotational degree of freedom into the dynamic equations for a turbulent fluid. The model distinguishes between orbital and intrinsic a lgular momentum of fluid elements, which are coupled by the anti symmetric component of the stress tensor. In ascribing anti symmetric stresses to the turbulent fluid, the expanding sphere model goes beyond the realm of theNavier Stokes equations, which describe fluids with a symmetric stress tensor.In addition to anti symmetric stresses, the rotational degree of freedom inherent in the expanding sphere turbulence model introduces couple stresses into the dynamical equations, which represent the flux of intrinsic angular momentum in a given direction in the same way as each component of the stress tensor represents the flux of linear momentum. The most important effect of the expanding sphere turbulence model reveals itself in the transport equation for heat, as derived from second law of thermodynamics one finds that in addition to heat transfer by translations of fluid elements there can be heat transfer by rotations of fluid elements also. Moreover, the flux of heat is thereby coupled to the flux of the intrinsic angular momentum in the tur bulent fluid.With regard to the transformation properties under proper as well as improper transformations one finds that the rotational contribution to the heat flux is as given in Equation 1 . An atmospheric plasma ball represents a spherically symmetric situation in which the outward heat flux q depends only on the distance from the center of the sphere, hence q L . 0 . 0 2 4 rê where L denotes the luminosity Watt of the plasma ball. In the form of Equation 2 , the heat flux has a vanishing divergence, in accordance with the concept of Equation 1 .. The solution for the vorticity curl v inside an atmospheric ball is obtained by integrating Equation 1 usingStokes theorem one finds a purely azimuthal vorticity of the form curl cL 1 cos 3 4 r sin where the positive sign refers to the northern hemisphere and the negative sign refers to the southern hemisphere. An alternative formula for the vorticity on the northern hemisphere of the plasma ball is cL tan , and for the southern hemisphere cL cot . These expres 4 r 2 4 r 2 sions show that the plasma ball consists of two counterrotating, but otherwise identical vortex rings, each of which occupies one hemisphere of the ball. As both c and L must be taken as positive quantities, the sense of the fluid circulation is such that the fluid moves outwardly along the axis of the rings the Z axis in Figures 3 to 6 and inwardly along the equatorial plane that separates the rings. the XOY plane inFigures 5 and 6 . The meridional plane XOZ in Figure 6 shows qualitative streamlines of the vortex ring occupying the northern hemisphere of the plasma ball.The equatorial plane XOY of Figure 6 contains radially inward streamlines of both vortex rings. These streamlines meet at the center of the sphere, and issue from the center along the polar axis Z, in opposite directions. On reaching the surface of the sphere, the streamlines along the polar axis branch out along meridians lying on the surface, and these branches return to the equatorial plane, where meridional streamlines issuing from opposite poles meet and turn inward to the center of the sphere. The overall circulation in a meridional plane is shown inFigure 3. The north and south poles of the plasma sphere are stagnation points, the equator is a stagnation ring. The center line of each vortex ring has the form of a circle, the location of which is determined by the density stratification inside the plasma sphere.If the center line of each vortex ring is close to the center of the sphere and far from the surface, then the density must be high in the central region and low in the.regions near the surface. The exact form of the streamlines of the vortex flow cannot be found directly from Equation 3 . The velocity 9 also has to satisfy the continuity equation divpv 0, which introduces the density p into the equations. For the axisymmetric flow considered here, the velocity only has meridional components vr, Vo, and the conti nuity equation is satisfied with a stream function v through ve ar.0n v, r.On substituting these expressions in Equation pr sine rsin 3 one obtains a 1 a sin 1 cL 1 cos3 4 r2 psin where the density depends only on the distance r from the center of the sphere.Equation 4 is a second order, elliptic, inhomogeneous partial differential equation for which analytic solutions can be obtained for the case of uniform density by means of Green s function technique. The uniform density case, however, is not relevant to the situation inside an atmospheric plasma ball, as described in Equation 1 . In order to have a pressure which decreases monotonically from its central value to its surface value of one atmosphere, the flow along the polar axis must be subsonic in the converging part of the vortex motion, but supersonic in the diverging part, as depicted in Figure 4 . Hence the outer part of the plasma sphere is in supersonic motion, and the central region is in subsonic motion. Correspondingly, the central region has a high density and temperature, but the surrounding layers have a progressively lower density and temperature.The amount of central concentration of the mass distribution cannot be determined without establishing an equation of state for the plasma which forms the sphere. The equation of state relates pressure, density and temperature, and is best examined in the logarithmic T,p plane depicted in Figure 2. The plasma sphere can be divided into three regions.Going inward from the surface 0 with atmospheric values for pressure, density and temperature there is first a thin boundary layer characterized by a constant pressure of one atmosphere. As the material of the boundary layer is still largely un ionized, the ideal gas law holds good. Under isobaric conditions, the ideal gas law implies that temperature and density are inversely proportional as the boundary layer gas heats up to surface temperature of the plasma ball, its density falls off. This behavior is represented as the isobaric line OA in Figure 2. At the same time the velocity grows from rest at the exterior surface of the boundary layer to supersonic values at the interface with the plasma sphere. The visible surface of the plasma sphere is the location where the photons decouple from matter.Outside the visible surface, the material is transparent, but inside the material is opaque, and radiation and molecular motion have the same temperature. Moving inward from the visible surface, the temperature of the plasma increases monotonically, and with it the degree of ionization of the molecules increases. The equation of state is now given by Saha s equation. For a complicated mixture of molecules like atmospheric air, Saha s equation predicts only a slow increase of temperature, but a much more rapid increase of density as one moves inward into the plasma ball starting from the visible surface. The broken part of curve AB in Figure 2 approximately represents the run of temperature and density in the region where pressure mainly comes from motion of partially ionized molecules, in accordance with Saha s equation.As the density increases further, curve AB enters the region where electron degeneracy becomes important, as in solids. The line PQ in Figure 2 separates the regions of the T,P plane where kinetic pressure dominates from the region where the pressure of. degenerate electrons dominates. So long as the degenerate electrons are non relativistic, the equation state is p kip5 3, where K is a constant. This implies that in the region of the plasma sphere where pressure comes primarily from degenerate electrons, the temperature must be proportional to p2 3. The same relation T p 2 3 holds for the line PQ in Figure 2, at which the contributions to the preset sure from the molecular motions and from degenerate electrons are equal. Therefore, as the density in the plasma ball increases, the curve AB will enter the region with degenerate electron pressure, and will continue parallel to PQ as the line BC, where C stands for the center of the plasma sphere. The position of the dividing line PQ in the T,p plane is only slightly sensitive to the chemical composition of the plasma which forms the sphere. The central values of temperature and density of any plasma sphere according to the concept of Equation 1 must always lie closely to PQ in Figure 2, even if the gases which make up the plasma are different from air. This is important since oxygen must be removed from air before it can be mixed safely with thermonuclear fuels such as deuterium and tritium.To summarize the three regions of an atmospheric plasma ball with different equations of state, we have Boundary layer ideal gas law isobaric pT const. 5A Envelope Saha s equation . T kPO 2 3 5B Central region electron degeneracy T Kp213 . 5C non relativistic The position of point 0 in Figure 2 is determined by the average temperature and density in the atmosphere. If the plasma ball is generated in a controlled environment, then the position of 0 can be changed. However, changes in temperature and density have no effect on the position of the line PQ, which is the locus of the central temperature and density of any plasma sphere according to the concept of Equation 1 .Since only the central temperature and density of the plasma sphere determine its usefulness as a vehicle for controlled fusion there is no need to supply the reaction chamber with equipment for pressurization or evacuation, as this only affects the position of 0 and not the essential position of the center C in Figure 2. The position of the visible surface A in the T,P plane is also dependent on conditions in the surrounding gas. For atmospheric fireballs, colors ranging from red to blue have been reported, and this may be related in an as yet unknown way to the central values of temperature and density. For main sequence stars, the trend is that blue stars have higher central parameters than stars with a red surface.Therefore, point A is situated in Figure 2 at 104 OKelvin. The surface temperature of a plasma sphere must be expected to be sensitive to the chemical composition of the plasma, and this will be a carefully controlled parameter in the thermonuclear reactor design described later. In the present model, stability of the plasma sphere arises from magnetic interaction of individual plasma eddies. Magnetic attraction of plasma eddies can produce stable plasma spheres just as gravitational attraction can produce stars. Like an ordinary magnet, and like other magnetic materials below the Curie temperature, such a plasma has a permanent magnetic field even in the absence of current or external magnetic fields. To explain how this magnetic interaction produces vortex motion in an atmospheric plasma ball, consider an electrical discharge between two electrodes immediately after breaking a very large short circuit current, as in Figures 11A and 11B. Initially, the current traverses the turbulent plasma slab 35 in the axial direction Z, driven by the power supply and self inductance of the electrical circuit.Magnetic field lines produced by the discharge current circle the Z axis in azimuthal direction. As ferromagnetic ordering of plasma eddies in azimuthal direction begins to increase the magnetic flux through meridional halfplanes e.g. plane XOZ of the plasma slab, Faraday s law of induction generates closed electric field lines in each meridional plane of the slab 35.Figure 11A shows a qualitative picture of closed and open field lines in the discharge between the copper bar 28A acting as anode, and the identical copper bar 28B acting as kathode. Electrical forces along open field lines only result in stresses on the immovable copper electrodes 28A and 28B, but electrical forces along closed field lines produce a meridional circulation in the plasma slab. With the direction of the closed field lines fixed by Faraday s law of induction, the sense of this meridi onal circulation depends on the sign of the space charge of the plasma. Near the anode, outward electric field lines will accelerate the positive plasma outward along the flat surfaceof electrode 28A.Near the kathode, inward electric field lines also accelerate the negative plasma outward along the flat surface of electrode 288. In the neutral midplane region between kathode and anode, there is no electric force to offset the inward magnetic force on all plasma elements, and the plasma is accelerated towards the axis Z as in linear pinch experiments. Figure 11B sketches streamlines of the resulting meridional circulation pattern in the plasma slab. The flow consists of two counterrotating, but otherwise identical vortex rings, as demanded by Equation 3 for atmospheric plasma balls.The sense of the meridional circulation sketched in Figure 11B is consistent with Lenz s law the electrical current produced by the circulation of both the positive anode region and the negative kathode region of the plasma slab results in an azimuthal magnetic field which opposes the increase of magnetic flux caused by ferromagnetic ordering of plasma eddies. In the steady state, plasma motion across magnetic field lines drives charge carriers of opposite sign towards the surface which separates inward and outward flow in each of the two vortex rings. In Figure llB the electric charge distribution is represented as an electric dipole layer in the midplane of the plasma slab 35.As long as plasma flows radially inward across.azimuthal magnetic field lines in the XOY plane, positive charge resides on the nodal surface 37A of the upper vortex ring, and negative charge resides on the nodal surface 37B of the lower vortex ring sketched in Figure llB Coulomb attraction of these two surface charges represents electrical energy as in a polarized dielectric. Such coupling between vortex motion and electric field energy turns the plasma slab into a hydromagnetic capacitor, as explained by Anderson et.al. in Journal of Applied Physics,Volume 30, Number 2 februari 1959 pag. 188 196. Such devices are known to store electrical energy with great efficiency. Relative dielectric constants obtained with rotating conductors in strong external magnetic fields range from 106 for low density plasma circulation, up to 1015 for metals spinning at the break up velocity. With the vacuum capacity of the electrode system 28A and 28B increased by this enormous amount, the discharge can store the observed range of ball lightning energies at moderate voltages. I conclude that a sufficiently strong electrical discharge between the flat electrodes 28A and 28B behaves as a dielectric slab with dielectric constant between 106 and 1015 times higher than in the vacuum. During the discharge, magnetic field energy residing in the circuit self inductance L is transferred to the discharge capacity C and stored as electrical energy.As long as the discharge stays between the electrodes 28A and 28B, the discharge current will oscillate with periodT 2slLC, provided the circuit resistance R satisfies R 2 L C. When the electrical circuit is first broken, the discharge current is maximal and all energy resides in the magnetic field of the circuit self inductanceL. The first current zero is reached after a time T 4. At zero current, all magnetic field energy of the circuit has been transferred to the discharge, where it is stored as dielectric field energy as in a polarized dielectric. The moment of zero discharge current is the proper time to remove the discharge from the region between the electrodes 28A and 28B. On leaving the electrode region, the slab can assume a spherical shape.This marks the birth of an independent plasma sphere 2, such as forms the heart of the present fusion reactor design. If the discharge were fed by an electrical circuit dominated by resistance or capacitance, the discharge current would not oscillate.Without zero s in the discharge current, it is difficult to see how the discharge could leave the electrode region between 28A and 28B, and take a significant fraction of the circuit energy with it. The ignition circuit must contain an inductor which can store the full energy to be imparted to the discharge and the plasma sphere resulting from it. Calculation of the electromagnetic field inside the independent plasma sphere must be based on Maxwell s equations, augmented by a constitutive equation of electrodynamics specifying the proposed magnetic interaction of turbulent plasma elements. This constitutive relation cannot be the usual linear dependance of the current density J on the electric field t. Ohmic currents would produce Joule heat, and a heat flux vector with non zero divergence violates the basic relation between heat flux and mass flow in the convective envelope, Equation 1 .Instead of Ohm s law, a linear relation A t between the current density 5 and the vector potential t is taken as constitutive equation for the convective envelope of the plasma sphere 2 6 where p is the magnetic permeability of the vacuum, and x is a constant with the dimension of a length. Equation 6 was first proposed by London to dcsrcibe magnetic phenomena in superconductors. Equation 6 guarantees absence of Ohmic dissipation and conservation of magnetic flux in the convective envelope of the plasma sphere.The state of ordered vortex motion across magnetic field lines in the turbulent plasma actually bears a close resemblance to the so called vortex state characteristic of type II superconductors.The steady state magnetic field equation is obtained directly by taking the curl on both sides of Equation 6 . With B curly and o J curlss, the magnetic field g turns out to obey curicurlt t X2 0 7 where the length scale has been taken uniform. magnetic field solutions of Equation 7 cannot be uniform. In the planar case, admissible solutions of Equation 7 are exponentially damped. Inside the plasma sphere, the magnetic field only has an azimuthal component.In spherical polar coordinates r,o, , the magnetic field inside the plasma sphere depends on radius r and polar angle e , but not on the azimuthal angle , because of symmetry about the polar axis Z of the coordinate frame. With the center of the plasma sphere located at r 0, the general solution of Equation 7 inside the convective envelope is where Pn cose EMI26.1 8a 8b ..... are associatedLégendre functions of the first kind, and modified spherical Bessel functions of the first kind respectively. Graphs of the first few Bessel functions inEquation 8b are given in Handbook of Mathematical Functions, edited byM. Abramowitz and I.A. Stegun Dover Publications Inc. New York , on page 444.The Bessel functions in Equation 8b all increase monotonously from zero at the center r 0, and thereby produce an inward magnetic pressure.All Legendre functions in Equation 8b vanish for polar angles e 0 and o it, and this ensures that there is no magnetic field anywhere on the polar axis Z. The lowest order mode n 1 of Equation 8b can be expressed in elementary functions as EMI26.2 which can be easily verified by substitution in Equation 7 . The magnetic field configuration of Equation 9 is shown in Figure 14B, as calculated with a programmable pocket calculator. On dashed lines in the right hand side of Figure 14B, the magnetic field has constant strength. Between adjacent lines, the strength of the magnetic field differs by a factor of two.For the sake of calculation, the length scale A in Equation 9 has been taken equal to the inner radius of the convective envelope the outer radius is ten times larger. Under these conditions, Equation 9 gives a surface value for the magnetic field which is about a thousand times larger than the the field at the inner radius of the convective envelope. The local strength of the magnetic field and the magnetic energy content of the plasma sphere is further determined by the coefficients Bn in Equation 8b . The direction of the magnetic force on the plasma is perpendicular to the field lines of the current density. Since the magnetic field is azimuthal, the current flows in meridional planes of the plasma sphere.Under axisymmetric conditions, field lines for 5 follow from its vector potential t through B rsine constant. By the London equation, Equation 6 , field lines of t the vector potential of t are field lines of the current with reversed direction. rield lines of S and 2, as derived from Equation 9 , are plotted in the left hand side of Figure 14B. The magnetic force JXB is perpendicular to these field lines, and lies in meridional planes. In the equatorial plane, the magnetic force direction is radially inward, but towards the poles the deviation in axial direction becomes progressively stronger. By means of higher order terms in the normal mode expansion Equation 8b , the field lines of the current can be made more nearly circular, and the magnetic force more nearly centripetal. However, for all combinations of normal modes in Equation 8b , the magnetic field vanishes on the polar axis. This indicates that the force balance of the plasma sphere must be completed with electrical forces arising from plasma motion across magnetic field lines. Under conditions of infinite conductivity, as underliethe London equation,Equation 6 , there is no electrical field in the rest frame of the plasma.On transforming to a laboratory frame in which the plasma moves with velocity v across a magnetic field B, the infinite conductivity condition turns into E vxB O 10 whereby the the electric field vector lies in meridional planes, and is perpendicular to streamlines of the vortex motion. In the present model, streamlines do not coincide with field lines of the current density. Thus the electric force need not be alligned with the magnetic force on the plasma. In connection with Equation 4 for the stream function it was remarked that streamlines of the vortex motion cannot be found analytically for compressible flow, but only by means of numerical integration on a. computer. By Equation 10 , the same remark applies to the calculation of the electric field.Still, some qualitative remarks can be made regarding the electric field configuration and its associated charge distribution. The electric field lines have at least one end on the inner surface of the convective envelope. Since counterrotating vortex rings occupy opposite sides of the equatorial plane, surface charges of opposite polarity accumulate on the inner surface. Like the plates of a charged capacitor, these two henlispherical surface charge distributions attract each other, and thereby compress the central region of the plasma sphere along the polar axis Z. This electric compression towards the equatorial plane complements the magnetic compression towards the polar axis discussed earlier.Given enough energy, these two forces will create static thermonuclear conditions in a small region around the center of the plasma sphere through radial adiabatic compression. Such electric field lines as do not cross the equatorial plane either ted towards the surface of the convective envelope, or bend towards the polar axis Z Thereby, the outer surface acquires a surface charge distribution, and the polar axis acquires a line charge distribution which is opposite to the charge residing on the inner surface of the convective envelope.The upper and lower hemisphere ofthe plasma ball each have an electric dipole moment alligned with the polar axis Z. In addition, each hemisphere has a net charge of opposite sign, because of the electric field lines which cross the equatorial plane. The total charge of the plasma sphere is zero. The dominant multipole moment of such a charge distribution is the linear octupole. In dielectric materials, the polarization vector need not be alligned with the electric field vector. This results in anti symmetric components in the stress tensor of the turbulent flow, which are the deeper reason for the insufficiency of the Navier Stokes equations, and the use of Equation 1 t describe the convective envelope of the plasma sphere.In the central region of the plasma, outward pressure comes in part from degenerate electrons, and outward energy transfer from radiation or conduction by electrons. For steady state operation of a plasma ball, diagrammatically illustrated at 2 in Figures lA, IB, lOA, and lOB, a thermonuclear fuel is transported towards the center from the ends of a reaction chamber, generally indicated at 4, and reaction products are removed continuously from the center. In the embodiments of Figures lB and lOB this is achieved by suspending the plasma ball between two gas jets, in the areas 8 and 9, See also Figure 12A coming from opposite directions. These jets contain fuel in such amounts that the fuel concentration in the plasma ball Is kept at a constant level through diffusion across the interface between the jets and the plasma ball. The jets are produced by two identical nozzles, generally indicated at 10A and lOB, centered on opposite ends of the plasma ball 2.The two nozzles, positioned along the Z axis of the reaction chamber 4, direct their jets toward the plasma sphere 2 and cause on each hemisphere a drag force in opposite directions. When the plasma sphere is displaced upwards, the downward drag force from the upper nozzle increases, but the upward drag force from the lower nozzle decreases hence there is a net downward drag force which tends to restore the plasma sphere to its equilibrium position. Likewise, a downward displacement of the plasma sphere results in a net upward drag force restoring the sphere to its equilibrium position. The conclusion is that the nozzlesl0A and 10B can stabilize motions of the plasma sphere along the polar axis Z. A qualitative picture of the flow pattern inside and around the plasma is shown in Figure 12h. The reaction chamber 4 is transparent to allow radiation emanating from the plasma surface to escape. The flow pattern of the jets inside the reaction chamber is characterized by a stagnation point at either pole of the central plasma ball 2 and by a stagnation ring located at its equator, as indicated in Figure 6. The gas leaves the reaction chamber through an exit port 6 and is collected for recirculation or recovery of the reaction products which, with deuterium or tritium for fuel, are isotopes and may be separated from the carrier gas by liquification. Prior to entering the chamber 4, or in the chamber itself, the fuel is mixed with the carrier gas in the required concentration. The energy output of the central plasma sphere can be regulated by a throttle valve, diagrammatically illustrated at 12 See also Figure 15 controlling the fuel concentration inside the jets.Alternatively, the fuel and carrier gases may be premixed in the desired ratio before the source is connected to the reaction chamber. The two nozzles lOA and lOB are of identical construction, as ilius trated in Figure 9. Each is designed to 1 produce a jet of carrier gas emanating from its central conical exit section 11, 2 produce a jet of fuel gas emanating from a hollow needle 13A, and 3 allow the fuel needle 13A to be connected to a source of electric potential not shown . Because of this potential, the outer parts 11,15 and 16 of the nozzle are made of insulating material, whereas the fuel needle 13A is made of metal.The position of the nozzle as a whole with respect to the reaction chamber 4 can be fixed, after adjustment, by tightening a screw 17. Also, the position of the fuel needle can be secured within the tube 16 of the nozzle by tightening a screw 18. The entrance section 15 of the nozzle is connected with a source 19 of carrier gas by a pipe 20. The entrance of the fuel needle 13A is connected by a pipe 21 to the fuel supply 22. The amount of fuel entering the reaction chamber 4 is contolled with the throttle valve 12. A perforated collar 23 keeps the fuel needle centered on the axis of the nozzle. When the metal needles 13A and 13B are placed at different potentials, an electric force arises on each hemisphere of the plasma sphere 2, which is directed towards the nearest needle. When the plasma is displaced away from the polar axis Z, both electrical forces become inclined with respect to the polar axis and there arises a net electrical force that tends to restore the plasma sphere to its equilibrium position, irrespective of the direction of its displacement. Hence, it is possible to stabilize motions away from the polar axis by means of the electric force on the plasma sphere arising from placing the metal needles 13A and 13B at a suitable potential difference.An additional effect of this external electrostatic field is that the plasma sphere, because of its charge distribution, orients itself along the polar axis Z of the external field.Electric field lines inside and around the plasma sphere are shown inFigures I IA and l2B. The dominant multipole moment of the charge distribution inside the plasma sphere 2 is a linear octupole in the upper hemisphere there is a distribution of negative charge throughout the.convective region, and of positive charge on the interface between the convective region and the core in the lower hemisphere, the situation is reversed the positive charge is distributed throughout the convective part and the negative charge is on the interface. All of these charge distributions are symmetric about the polar axis Z, and together form a linear octupole. If the plasma sphere were confined only by two jets, as in Figure 12A, the displacements away from the polar axis would be unstable simimarly, confinement by an electric field only, as in Figure 12B, is unstable with respect to displacement along the polar axis Z. When the two forces are combined, however, as in Figure 12C, the plasma sphere can be kept in a stable position without touching the walls of the reaction chamber at any point. The precise position of the sphere can be controlled by changing the strength of either gas jet, or by changing the potential of the needles 13A and 13B. The correct values for these adJustable parameters can be determined beforehand by substituting for the plasma sphere a thin metal sphere with the same dimensions, as such a sphere is equally susceptible to drag forces from the jets and electric forces from the needles. The central plasma ball is created as follows An electrical power supply is short circuited by placing the slugs 32A and 32B between the electrodes 28A ans 28B see Figures 7 and 8 . The electrical circuit includes a power supply with voltage E, and an inductor with self inductanceL the total resistance of the circuit is R. The differential equation E Rt governing the current is LdI dt IR E, with the solution I t1 exp . As the short circuit current rises from zero to its asymptotic value E R, the slugs 32A and 32B are pulled outward simultaneously, leaving a gap between the electrodes 28A and 28B. Since at the moment of interruption, the circuit contains a non zero magnetic flux LI, inductive effects produce an arc discharge across the gap. If the discharge current exceeds a threshhold value of about 150 kiloamperes, ferromagnetic ordering of turbulent plasma elements is responsible for the discharge to behave as a large effective capacity C. After breaking the circuit and formation of the discharge, the equivalent electrical circuit is a series L, C, R circuit, connected to a voltage E see Figure 13A .Taking the circuit parametersL, C, R, and E as independent of time, the differential equation for the current is now Ld2I dt2 RdI dt I C 0, which has periodic solutions provided R2 4L C. For sufficiently small resistance R, the current oscillates harmonically with period 2it LC. At maximum and minimum values of the currentI, the field energy of the oscillation is stored completely in the magnetic energy iLI2of the inductor. At zero current, the entire field energy is stored in the electrical energy Q2 2C of the capacitor, where Q is the charge on one of the capacitor blades. Some charge leakage is likely to occur through the discharge therefore, it would be more realistic to represent the arc in the equivalent electrical circuit as a capacitor parallel with a resistor.Furthermore, the discharge capacity is not constant, but increases with the strength of vortex motion in the plasma. Thirdly, the contribution of transformer iron to the circuit self inductance L depends on the magnitude of the current I, because of saturation. For these reasons, the following numerical discussion can only give order of magnitude estimates for the the electrical circuit parameters necessary to form a thermonuclear plasma sphere. Consider a cylindrical lightning discharge of radius r 0.1 meter and length 1 100 meter. At a discharge current of 200 kAmps, the energy Em of of the magnetic field around the discharge may be estimated as JKBdV oI2I ln l 2.4x106 Joule, where Fuzz x10 7 N A is the magnetic 2 r permeability of the vacuum. The self inductance of this lightning stroke is given by L 2Em I2 1.2x10 4 Henry. Next conside r an electrical circuit consisting of cylindrical copper bars of radius rO 0.1 meter and length l 10 meter on board of a ship. In the event of an electrical short circuit, the magnetic field of a sufficiently large short circuit current will magnetize the iron hull of the ship to saturation.The effect of the iron hull is represented in the equivalent electrical circuit of Figure 13A as the magnetic core of the inductor L. For the sake of calculation, represent the hull of the ship as a cylinder surrounding the copper bars over their full length with massive transformer iron. With length 1 10 meter, inner radius rO 0.1 meter and outer radius r1 10 meter, the cylinder volume will be V s r1 ro2 l 31 m3, and this represents a mass of 2.5x106 kg iron. If all this iron is magnetized to a saturation field of B 1.5 Tesla, the magnetic energy at current I 200 kAmps is JHBdV BsIl rl rO 2.7x106 Joule. This is comparable in magnitude to the magnetic energy in the lightning discharge calculated above. In the present case, the magnetic energy does not depend quadratically in the current I, but only linearly, because the iron cylinder around the current will be completely saturated. This also means that the self inductance of the cylinder depends on the magnitude of the current. In submarines, the electrical power supply is a set of batteries capable of producing short circuit currents of more than 100 kAmps.If such a battery bank with voltage E is short circuited, the current reaches 1 0.63 of its asymptotic value Im E R after a characteristic time t L R. Typically, the characteristic time in submarine short circuits is given as 0.05 sec, which is consistent with L 10 4 Henry and R 2x1 3 Ohm for the relevant circuit parameters The battery bank must have a voltage E 1mR 633 Volt for the current to reach 200 kAmps at t 0.05 sec, as in Figure 13B. At this moment, an energy iLI2 2X106 Joule is stored in the magnetic field, and this is 54 of the work done by the battery bank since the circuit was shorted. The remaining 46 X has of course been dissipated as Joule heat in the circuit resistance R. The resistance of 10 meter copper bar with radius 5 cm is 14x10 6 Ohm. Clearly the main contribution to the circuit resistance comes from the internal resistance of the battery bank. With internal resistance 0.08 Ohm, on ordinary 12 Volt car battery will have a shortcircuit current of 150 Amps.Anarray of 2000 parallel rows of 50 of such car batteries in series can produce the required maximum short circuit current of about 300 kAmps at 600 Volt, and such a power supply will just have the internal resistance R 2xlO 3 Ohm indicated above. The generation of plasma spheres during switching errors in the engine room of ships was discussed by P.A. Silberg in his article Review of Ball Lightning in Problems of Atmospheric Electricity, editor S. Coroniti, Elsevier . As the electrical circuit is broken at t 0.05 sec., the discharge capacity C enters the differential equation for the current. A periodic solution for the current is desired, in which the magnetic field energy of the inductor L turns into electrical energy in the capacitor C with as little dissipative losses as possible.At zero current, the circuit contains no magnetic flux, sothat the oscillation can be stopped by blowing the turbulent plasma slab 35 away from the electrodes 28A and 28B by means of the nozzle 10A in Figures 1A and 10A, or the nozzle 10C in Figures 1B and 10B. On leaving the electrode gap, the plasma slab 35 transforms into a self contained plasma sphere , and floats towards its central position in the reaction chamber 4 indicated on Figures 1A, 1B, lOA and 10B. After breaking the circuit at t 0.05 sec., the first zero of the current occurs after i of the oscillation period 2s LC. For the sake of calculation, the first current zero is taken at t 0.06 sec., which gives 0.04 sec. for the oscillation period and, with L 10 4 Henry for the circuit self inductance, an estimate of C 0.4 Farad for the capacity of the discharge. Without discharge, the capacity of the electrodes would be given by C 0A d 4.4x10 12 Farad, where Eo 8.8x10 12 Farad meter is the dielectric constant of the vacuum, A 10 2 m2 is the electrode surface area, and d 2x10 2 meter is the electrode spacing. To make up the difference, the discharge must have a relative dielectric constant of 0.4 4.4x10 12 1011.This high value still falls within the range of values reported for rotating devices 106 for a iow density plasma capacitor to 1015 for solids spinning at the.break up velocity. Figure 13B sketches the discharge current during ignition, idealized as above. Instead of a battery bank, the ignition circuit could also be equipped with a capacitive power supply, for instance a capacitor bank or a homopolar generator. The electrical circuit then must include a switch S which disconnects the power supply without interrupting the circuit.The equivalent electrical circuit is now as in Figure 13C, and the ignition procedure is as follows At t 0, the switch S is connected with the power supply E, and the electrodes 28A and 28B are short circuited by means of the slugs 32A and 32B. At this stage, the circuit consists of the power supply capacity Cp and the circuit inductance L, sothat the discharge current will oscillate with period 2itVLC . Since the discharge current starts at zero, it p reaches its first maximum after i of its oscillation period. At this moment, all energy of the oscillation resides in the magnetic field of the inductor i.This magnetic energy is not allowed to return to the power supply. By means of switch S, the power supply is disconnected from the circuit, and simultaneously the slugs 32A and 32B are removed from the electrodes 28A and 28B. Instead of returning to the power supply, the magnetic energy of the inductor now ends up in the arc discharge as before. The presence of a large inductor in the ignition circuit is the feature essential to the formation of an energetic plasma ball, and not the way in which the inductor acquires magnetic energy. Ignition apparatus for creating the plasma ball by means of an arc is generally indicated at 25 in Figures 1A, 1B, 7 and 8. A duct 24 of ashcstos or other non combustible material is connected to an opening at the equator of the chamber 4. To create an arc within the duct 24, Figures 7 and 8 two electrodes 26A and 26B are formed of heavy, opposing, spaced copper bars extending transversely into the duct 24. The ends of these electrodes are provided with contacts, as indicated at 28A and 28B, of silver or other highly conductive metal resistant to oxidation and which can withstand high temperatures. The duct 24 is provided also with two oppositily disposed outwardly extending collars 30A and 30B having longitudinal openings into the interior of the duct 24 in alignment with and on opposite sides of the gap between the electrodes.To provide a low resistance path capable of.conducting a high current between the electrodes, two generally cubical silver slugs 32A and 32B are slidably positioned in the collars and coupled to insulating arms 34A and 34B by which the slugs can be moved radially inwardly into.the gap between the contacts 28A and 28B. The slugs are dimensioned to fit nicely between the contacts to form a low resistance connection cap able of carrying a high current. The arms 34A and 34B are connected to a shutter mechanism not shown which may be of any design capable of rapidly separating the two slugs from the contacts. Speeds in the order of one to a few milliseconds can be attained with available mechanisms, and such speed is important in generating the fireball. The high intensity arc that forms between the contact points gives rise to a fireball capable of leaving the area where it is init sated. In this instance, the fireball is caused to move into the chamber 4 by the gas jet which passes through the duct 24 into the chamber 4 and by the magnetic force created by the current through the arc and the electrodes 26A and 26B. As noted above, the plasma ball, after being transported into the chamber 4, is maintained in position, away from the chamber walls, by the force of the two opposing jets from the nozzles lOA and lOB and the electrostatic field. The characteristics of the glass forming the chamber 4 are the same as those previously used in the construction of the torus commonly used as a chamber for thermonuclear reactions. The chamber 4 is formed of two identical generally conical sections 4A and 4B, the larger ends of which are held in juxtaposition by longitudinal compression by any suitable mechanism that permits exhaust gases to escape from the space between them into an annular collection ring 36 connected to the port 6. In this example, the collection ring is interrupted to provide room for the arc discharge mechanism 25. The third nozzle lOC is used only during the initial creation and positioning of the plasma sphere, whereas in the embodiment of Figure 1A, to be described, the jet used to displace and position the plasma ball continues to function during the fusion process. In operation, the plasma ball 2 is maintained in the central area of the chamber 4 and the reaction products, along with the excess carrier gas and any unused fuel, are discharged into the ring 36 and outwardly through the port 6 for disposal or recovery of useful gases. The plasma sphere is maintained in the central area of the chamber by the two opposing nozzles lOA and lOB in combination with the externally created electrostatic field. These gaseous jets are formed of light gases, whose nuclei are capable of reacting to form heavier nuclei, and a carrier gas that takes no part in the reaction.The active gas may, for example, be equal parts of deuterium and tritium. The inactive gas may be nitrogen or some even less reactive gas.The major portion of the mixture is the inert gas carrier and its concentration must be enough so that it forms an effective shield that imprisons high energy photons in the core of the plasma sphere. The composition of the fuel mixture will be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of the particular system. It may for example consist of 5 deuterium, 5 tritium, and 90X nitrogen. The gaseous jets thugs serve the multiple functions of maintaining the plasma ball in position, so that. it does not touch the walls of the chamber, providing a continuous supply of reaction fuel, and flushing the reaction products from the chamber. By regulating the flow of fuel gases into the jet, as by valve 12, it is possible to control the rate of energy generation in the thermo nuclear region. The construction of the chamber and the mode of operation may assume many different forms. To some extent these will depend upon the size and density of the plasma sphere. If the density of the plasma is significantly greater than air, the sphere may be maintained in position by a single operating nozzle. Such a configuration is illustrated by Figures 1A and lOA considered in conjunction with the explanatory Figures 12k, 12B and 12C In this example, the sphere is created by the arc structure 25 and blown by means of the nozzle into position in the chamber. The force of the jet from the bottom nozzle lOB and the electric potential connected to the needle 13B serve to maintain the sphere 2 in position. One method of maintaining the plasma sphere 2 in the desired position is by use of a servomechanism that senses the position of the plasma ball, by optical or other type sensors, and adjusts the velocity of the carrier gas entering the chamber through one or both of the nozzles or the strength of the electrostatic field as may be necessary to maintain the position of the plasma sphere. It is contemplated that under certain operating conditions the means for initial creation of the plasma ball may be omitted from the reactor structure, the plasma ball being generated in a separate apparatus temporarily connected to the fusion reactor, the apparatus being removed once the reactor is placed in operation. From the foregoing it will be seen that my invention may take a variety of forms in terms of physical construction as.well as in the mode of operation thereby adapting it for the economical and practical requirements of each particular application.I CLAIM
