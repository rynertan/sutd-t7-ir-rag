## Description
V ESr PROTEIN FORTIFIED ACIDIC LIQUID BEVERAGES 4D PREPARATION THEREOF The present invention relates to whey protein fortified acidic liquid beverages and to the pre paration thereof. Acidic liquid beverages, either carbonate or still, especially of the citrus variety, are well known In the preparation of liquid acidic beverages, inorganic acids such as phosphoric acid or organic acids such as citric acid are soften used to acidify the beverages to the proper level. Phosphoric acid is generally used for cola type beverages which have below 3. Citric acid is generally used to acidify still beverages which have a pH within the range of 4.0 to 3. Acidified liquid beverages can be preparea in single strength or concentrate. Single strength beverages are those which are prepared from the raw ingredients in the concentration used in the final beverage. These beverages are directly bottled for sale. Generally, the contents of the bottles ar pasteurized to prevent undue microbial growth. Acidified liquid beverages can also be prepared as liquid concentrates. In one form, the concentrates containing all of the final ingredients are diluted to proper strength with water, carbonated water, fruit juices or like liquid. The diluted beverages so prepared are then bottled and if desired pasteurized, for sale to the consumer. In another form, the concentrate which contains all the flavoring but not all the acid needed to adjust the pH to the level desired is diluted and the pH adjusted at the bottling facility. Because of their low, nutritive value, much investigation has been undertaken in an attempt to protein fortify these acidic beverages. For instance, a clear, still beverage has been prepared using cheese whey protein concentrate prepared by ultrafiltration of cottage cheese whey Holsinger et al., Food Technology, February 1973, p. 59 .Also of relevance is U.S. Patent No. 3,922,375. In the preparation of liquid beverages contain ing whey protein concentrate by Holsinger et al., the whey protein was ultrafiltered and then gel filtered to obtain a product having 81. protein, 10.86 lactose and a very low ash content of 1.5 .Citric acid and phosphoric acid were effectively used to acidify the solutions because of the low ash level of the whey protein fortified. The products were storage stable when bottled for at least one year. It is known that the salts of a whey protein concentrate exert a high acid buffering capacity U.S. 3,896,241 . This patent teaches 9 method for overcoming this problem by preparing a whey protein concentrate for use in beverages including the steps of filtering through diatomaceous earth, then ultrafiltering and contacting the concentrate with a strongly cationic exchange resin. The product is low in mineral salt and has a low pH not requiring substantial use of acidulants. Both the product used in Holsinger et al. and U.S. PatentNo. 3,896,241 required extensive costly processing in order to decrease the ash level sufficiently low for effective use. In attempting to protein fortify a liquid acidified beverage with a whey protein concentrate derived primarily by the ultrafiltration of whey, it was observed that the buffering capacity of the whey protein concentrate required a large amount of citric acid to adjust the pH to the proper range. A whey protein concentrate prepared by ultrafiltration generally has at least 3 ash.The higher the asn level1 the more citric acid is required to adjust the pH to the proper level. The use of a larger amount of citric acid causes the taste of the beverage to become too sour and unpalatable. Other acidulants such as fumaric acid are well known to be useful in acidifying various foods.Because of the non hygroscopic character of fumaric acid vis a vis citric acid, it is an extremely valuable ingredient in extending the shelf lifeof many kinds of powdered food products such as powdered beverages. However, the slow solubility rate of fumaric acid in water at low temperatures which is a disadvantage as an acidulant for cold water beverages, has been overcome by admixing the acid with 0.3 dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate and 0.5 calcium carbonate. This material, a cold water soluble fumaric acid, is sold for use in dried beverage powders, frozen food concentrates, frozen desserts, acidulated dry beverage bases and fumaric acid acidulated fruit juice drinks. An alternative method of increasing the solubility rate of fumaric acid in water is through the addition of a small percentage of modified starch. Coid water soluble fumaric acids for use in dry or powdered beverages are disclosed in U.S. PatentNos. 3,011,894 and3,181,953. No prior art is known wherein cold water soluble fumaric acid has been used as an acidulant in liquid acidic beverages which contain a whey protein concentrate having a high ash content and which evidence severe problems in taste. Further, the greater the amount of protein used, the greater the amount of acid required to overcome the buffering ef fect of the protein and the ash.The limited solubili ty of fumaric acid does not make it adaptable for use i acidifying livid beverages having higher levels of whey protein sInce the amount of acid needed to lower the pH far exceeds the solubility level of rumaric acid in the beverage. Because of the low solubility, zumaric acid is not recommended as an acidifying agent for liquid beverages. It has now been found that the flavor problem incurred in providing for the necessary pH adjustment for a high ash, whey protein concentrate containing liquid beverage can be overcome. In accordance with the present invention, it has been found that, ina liquid acidic beverage or liquid concentrate therefore fortified with â composition comprising 1 from about 75 to about 100q by weight of a whey protein concentrate having at least 40 protein and at least 3 and preferably from about 3 to about 15 ash and 2 from about 25 to 0E of another protein containing whey based product wherein the whey protein concentration of the liquid acidic beverage is from about O.i to about 5 , the pH can be effectively lowered by adjusting the pH within the range of from about pH 3 to pH 4 with a cold water soluble fumaric acid without providing a be e 2g2 ile s S too sour and unpalatable.A more economical product is also obtained because o reduced amount of fumaric acid needed to effect the necessary pH adjustment vis a vis citric acid. A single strength beverage can be obtained using fumaric acid in place of cold water soluble fumaric acid when low concentrations of acid are required.The beverages of the present invention are stable both before and after pasteurization and storage. Protein fortified beverages of the present invention when acidified from neutral pH to a pH of about 3 4 are less turbid than beverages fortified with whey protein concentrates dried at acidic pH which are subsequently acidified to the desired level. As used herein, stable suspension is intended to cover beverages both before and after pasteurization which do not form precipitates and settle upon standing for one month. Commercial stable suspensions are defined as not forming precipitates or settling upon standing for three months. The whey protein concentrate having at least 3 and preferably from about 3 to about 15 ash used in the present invention can be derived from any cheese whey. Cheese whey is the byproduct of the acid, or rennet coagulation of milk protein i.e., casein from milk in the manufacture of cheese. The whey obtained from the acid coagulation is called acid or cottage cheese whey and that obtained from rennet, sweet or cheddar cheese whey The preferred cheese whey for use in preparing the concentrates used in the present invention is 100 acid cottage cheese whey or blends with up to 208 sweew cheese whey. The more preferred is 100 acid cottage cheese3 whey. The whey protein concentrate prepared from acid whey has a bland flavor which does not interfere with the other flavors in the drink.The remaining descriptIon wili relate to the preferred embodiment, a protein concentrate from acid cheese whey. The whey protein concentrate used in the present invention is prepared by ultrafiltration Horton, B.S. et al., Food Technology, Volume 26, page 3C, 1972 . The most effective results are obtained using are ultrafiltered whey concentrate from cottage cheese whey containing from about 408 to about 608 and preferably about 45 559 whey protein. These percentages are by weight based on the total dry solids in said concentrate. In a typical process, cottage cheese whey is neutralized to a pM of about 6.4 with 508 caustic. After storage, the pH is then adjusted to about pH 7.2 and any solids or precipitates are removed by centrifuged clarifiers.For effective long term storage stability, it is preferred that the spin down after clarification is less than 0.1 by weight of the sample volume. The clarified liquor is then pasteurized and fed to an ultrafiltration membrane unit. The retentate is condensed and spray dried. Protein products generally comprising from about 40 to óQE whey protein TN x 6.38 , 10 30t lactose, 3 15 ash and 0.1 48 fat are prepared by this process. A typical product has about 108 total ash which includes about 1.98 sodium, 1.67 potassium, 1.15 calcium, 0.93 phosphorus and 0.21 magnesium.It is theorized that the phosphorus present as phosphate is the most significant factcr of the ash in contributing to the buffering affect. The dried retentate with the aforegiven composition is con sidered a whey protein concentrate. While it is preferred to use the whey protein concentrate in the dry form, the liquid form can also be used on a percent by weight protein basis. Liquid levels in the final formulation are then adjusted according ly. Liquid whey protein concentrate must be kept under refrigeration to prevent spoilage. For nutritional purposes, it is preferred to use a low ash, low sodium whey protein concentrate in the liquid beverages of the invention, i.e., an ash level below the average of 10 and above the 3 lower limit. These can be prepared by processing acid whey at native pH to avoid the addition of sodium by neutralizing with caustic.Also, a low ash whey protein concentrate can be prepared by adjusting the protein content own to the desired level with a filler, i.e., dilute 60 whey protein concentrate to 50 whey protein with lac tose. A sodium and ash level lower than that obtained by preparing a 50 whey protein concentrate directly by ultrafiltration can be obtained. In addition to the whey protein concentrate, the whey protein fortifier composition can also include from about 25 to about 0 of another whey protein containing composition such as dried whey, delactosed whey and delactosed demineralized whey where demineralization is accomplished by any known method such as electrodialysis. Cold water soluble fumaric acid is ciassified by the Food and Drug Administration as solubilized fumaric acid suitable for human consumption. These materials generally include fumaric acid mixed with a blend of 0.3 dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate DOSS and 0.5 calcium carbonate percent by weight based on the total dry weight of the fumaric acid . This is set forth in the Handbook of Food Additives, published by the Chemical Rubber Publishing Company at page 257. Other cold water soluble fumaric acids such as those prepared with an edible starch approximately less than 18 are also useful in the present invention.By cold water soluble fumaric acid is meant any fumaric acid which has been modified to increase the rate of solubility in cold water 250C. greater than the rate of solubility for fumaric acid in water t 25 C. The acidic soft drinks which can be fortified with protein In accordance with the present invention include any acidic soft drink, ether natural or formulated, which has a final pH between the range of from about 3.0 to about 4.0. These include citrus and citrus flavored drinks including natural orange juice, lemonade, lime, lemon lime and the like. Drinks of other flavors such as mango can also be prepared. The soft drink can be carbonated or non carbonated still as desired. Carbonation can be effected by any technique known to be useful in the art. The drinks which are most typically within the stated pM range are the citrus flavored type. A typical composition includes 11 sugar, 888 water, 0.238 citric acid and flavorings. The acidic liquid beverage is normally comprised mainly of water as well as sugar t5 sucrose protein fortifier composition, acicuiant and flavoring agents. The liquid beverage can also contain natural liquid fruit juices, if desired. Any sweetening agents normally used in these beverages can be used in place of or combined with the sucrose. The acidic liquid beverages of the invention are intended to be fortified with whey protein in an amount ranging from about 0.5 to about 5 by weight protein based on the total weight of the liquid beverage. It is preferable that the protein fortification range from about 1 to about 3 by weight. The actual amount of solids added depends on the concentration of whey protein in the whey protein concentrate. The amour.t of acid required to be used depends on the amount of protein and ash contained in the beverage. The greater the amount o protein and ash, the greater the amount of acid needed to achieve. the necessary pM. For instance, in a beverage containing 1.3 protein derived from a low ash, low sodium whey protein concentrate containing 50 protein, 0.3 cold water soluble fumaric acid was required to lower the pil to 3.35 and still obtain a very palatable beverage.In general, the fumaric acid acidulant can be used in amounts ranging from about 0.12 to about 0.50 by weight based on the total weight of the liquid beverage though this amount depends on the protein content utilized and the final desired pM within the range of 3 to 4. Because of the low solubility of fumaric acid, modified fumaric acid can be used to acidify single strength beverages, particularly those requiring small amounts of acid for the necessary pM adjustment, i.e., low protein fortification.If the buffering effect of the whey protein concentrate is high enough, cold water soluble fumaric acid or mixtures of Lumaric acid cold water soluble fumaric acid can be used. Cold water soluble fumaric acid can be and is preferably used for both single strength and concentrates. Concentrates are generally prepared for dilution at a rate of 6 to 1 4 to 1. The liquid acidic beverage or concentrate can be prepared by dissolving the whey protein concentrate in water and adding thereto an amount of acid needed to decrease the pM to the proper level. The whey protein concentrate can also be admixed or coblended with the fumaric acid and, if desired, the other dry ingredients, of the beverage, liquefied, and adjusted to the proper pH. The beverage can also contain any of the optional flavoring ingredients, flavor enhancers, emulsifiers, coloring ingredients, clouding agents or other such ingredients normally used in preparing acid liquid beverages. The preferred liquid beverages of the present invention are the citrus type. Fruit juices or flavor characteristic of the country of use can also be added such as mango. It has also been found that fumaric acid and cold water soluble fumaric acid can be partially combined with phosphoric acid to provide the proper pM. For instance, cold water soluble fumaric acid can be used to partially reduce the pH below a pH of about 4.5 and preferably below a pH of about 4 followed by adding phosphoric acid to reduce the pM to the final desired level. The product is smooth, stable and very palatable. The liquid acidified beverage is less tart than a similar beverage prepared using citric or malic acid in place of the phosphoric acid. The beverages prepared with citrus and malic acids are too tart and unpalatable.Phosphoric acids usable in this aspect of the invention include any food grade phosphoric acid such as 858 phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid is generally used in small amounts, i.e., that amount needed to reduce the pH from about 4.5 to that pH within the range of 3 to 4 that is desired. For single strength beverages and concentrates, cold water soluble fumaric acid is preferred though fumaric acid can be used in combination with the phosphoric acid for both types of beverages particularly if the amount of fumaric acid is sufficientlv low to be soluble in the concentrate. The beverages disclosed herein are those adapted to be conveyed to the consuming public for consumption without further dilution. In the case o the liquid concentrate, this is not intended to be sold to te consuming public but as is usual in the industry, to bottlers or dispensers of such liquid beverages. The liquid beveragescare containerized and sold to the consuming public in containers appropriate to the liquid and the industry. Still beverages can be sold in waxed cartons, bottles or other like containers. Carbonated beverages are usually conveyed in containers of glass or plastic sufficiently adapted to maintain the gas pressure within the container. Concentrates are containerized in vessels adapated for end use, i.e., bottling or unit dispensing. The beverages of the invention are particularly adapated to be conveyed to the public in a nonrefrigerated state requiring pasteurization for health purposes. The proteins remain stable even after pasteurization. The beverages can also be conveyed in refrigerated storage if desired The present invention will be more fully illustrated in the examples which follow. EXfl i ijS 1 A liquid acidic still beverage was prepared containing a whey protein concentrate prepared by ultrafiltering acid whey until a protein content of approximately 60 by weight of the whey protein concentrate is reached followed by diluting the whey protein concentrate with lactose to 2 protein level of about 50 to form a product lower in sodium and ash content than a whey protein concentrate prepared by ultrafiltering acid whey to about 50 protein.The following recipe or the liquid beverage was used INGREDIENTS Water 200 milliliters Sr 23 grams Whey Protein Concentrate 6 grams Part o the sugar was dissolved in the 200 milliliters o water. The remaining sugar was dry mixed with the whey protein concentrate in a mortar with a pestle. The dry mix was slowly added to the sugar water solution with stirring until dissolved. Using a pH meter and magnetic stirrer, cold water soluble fumaric acid was gradually added with stirring until a pM of 3.35 was reached. 0.6 grams of fumaric aciÅa was required. Controls using citric acid 1.47. grams and malic acid 1.32 grams were also prepared using the same procedure. The beverage prepared with fumaric acid was the least sour and most sweet of the three. The citric acid and malic acid controls were very sour and unpalatable. The beverages were pasteurized by heating at 750C. for 20 minutes and cooled. All three beverages were stable. R SEPLE 2 A liquid whey protein fortified acid, i.e., still beverage was prepared by blending 5.8 grams of the whey protein concentrate as defined in Example 1 and 0.6 grams of a cold water soluble fumaric acid modified with starch in a mortar with a pestle.This blend is then added siowly to a solution of 23 grams sugar dissolved in 200 milliliters of water with mixing until dissolved. The product was pasteurized as in Example 1. The pH was 3.4 with a somewhat tart taste. Natural mango flavor was added to provide a pleasant beverage. EXAMPLE 3 Example 2 was repeated using 6 grams of whey protein concentrate and 0.6 grams of regular fumaric acid. The liquid beverage had a palatable somewhat tart taste. EXAMPLE 4 A whey protein containing beverage was pre pared as in Example 1 with the exception that the pK was lowered from a native pH of 6.5 to a pM of 3.7 using 0.4 grams of cold water soluble fumaric acid.The pM was then adjusted from pH 3.7 to pM 3.35 with citric acid 0.66 grams . The beverage was extremely sour and unpalatable. EXAMPLE 5 The process of Example 4 was repeated using 85 phosphoric acid in place of the citric acid. The beverage was extremely smooth, less tart than the product of Example 4 and very palatable.
