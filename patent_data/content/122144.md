# Optical data storage.

## Abstract
Optical data storage members are disclosed in which the guard bands present between data carrying tracks of con ventional data storage members are used to carry information recorded in a manner which avoids the danger of cross talk be tween adjcent tracks. One preferred arrangement consists of an optical data storage member comprising an optically record able surface having a plurality of tracks in which information may be recorded in analogue or digital form, the tracks being of a first type in which the material constituting the track is sen sitive to radiation of a first predetermined characteristic and a second type in which the material thereof is sensitive to radia tion of a second predetermined characteristic, wherein tracks of the first type alternate across the surface of the optical data storage member with tracks of the second type. The tracks may be constituted by a surface region carrying a plurality of closely spaced grooves, the grooves of one track being or thogonally directed with respect to those of its adjacent tracks. The predetermined radiation characteristic can be the polarisa tion state of the incident radiation.
