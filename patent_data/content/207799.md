# IMPROVED COOLANT PASSAGE STRUCTURE FOR ROTOR BLADES IN A COMBUSTION TURBINE

## Abstract
A combustion turbine rotor blade is provided with an airfoil portion having a plurality of coolant holes extending radially outwardly therethrough. The coolant holes are ta pered to a smaller flow cross section in the radially outward direction to produce more uniform cooling action over the length of the holes over which tapering is provided.
