# Capsule sorting apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for sorting capsule components is described, which consists of assembled capsules 13 from unassembled capsule bodies and caps characterized by a conveyor plate 16 positioned to receive the capsule compo nents, a vibratory drive 18 coupled to said conveyor plate 16 for effecting progressive movement of said capsule com ponents along said conveyor plate 16 toward an exit chute 27 , said conveyor plate 16 having a plurality of circular holes with a diameter greater than the diameter of the capsule caps and less than the length of an assembled capsule 13 , an upper plate 21 spaced above said conveyor at a distance less than said cap length and greater than said cap diameter, said upper plate 21 having a plurality of circular holes in coaxial alignment with the holes in said conveyor plate 16 and hav ing a diameter slightly greater than the length of an assem bled capsule 13 , said conveyor plate 16 and said upper plate 21 cooperating to permit passage of only said caps and said bodies through the holes in said conveyor plate 16 .
