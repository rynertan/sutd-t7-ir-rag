# Sectional ingot mold.

## Abstract
A sectional ingot mold 10 formed of a plurality of side wall sections 12,14,16,18 which when assembled define at least the side periphery of a mold cavity, with means coacting on the side wall sections for coupling the wall sections together into an integral unitary ingot mold 10 said means, providing for automatic compensation for expansion and retraction of the mold assembly sections when molten metal is poured into the ingot mold by providing for expeditious expansion of the mold assembly sections with respect to one another while aiding in sealing the mold sections from leak age of molten metal during the pouring and cooling of the ingot in the mold. In certain embodiments, yieldable gasket 34 material is disposed between the wall sections at their junctions for aiding in preventing leakage of molten metal from the ingot mold assembly during pouring and solidifica tion of an ingot in the mold. The interior surface 22 of each mold section may be sinuous for aiding in stress relief of the formed ingot while aiding in reducing external skin cracks of the ingot or leakage of molten metal from the mold and or the interior 22 of the newly formed ingot.
