# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING ELASTOMERIC PARTICLES FREE OF AGGLOMERATION

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process of producing elastomeric particles, such as those of natural and synthetic powdered and crumb rubbers and to the compositions prepared in accordance with such process. Specifically, the invention comprises encapsulating the elastomeric particles with a coating or film of a preplasticized vinyl resin, such as, for example, polymers and copolymers of vinyl and vinylidene halides and the like. The resultant composite particles are free flowing and free of irreversible agglomeration and can be used in dry blending with other materials prior to being formed into useful articles.
