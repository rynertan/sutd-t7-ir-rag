# Digital paging system having bit rate switching means and digital paging receiver therefor.

## Abstract
The described paging system is capable of effectively transmitting and receiving message codes without adverse ly affecting the paging code especially address code re ception probability. The paging receiver comprises a receiver device 1, 2, 3 for receiving a paging code including a first code having a first transmission rate, a second code having a second transmission rate and a discrimination code for distinguish ing the first and second codes. A low pass filter LPF 4 is connected to the output of the receiver device 1, 2, 3 for switching its cut off frequency in response to a control sig nal S2 and selectively extracting the first and second codes. A data processing section 12 is coupled to the output of the LPF 4 for generating the control signal S2 in response to the received discrimination code, supplying the control signal S2 to the LPF 4 , and decoding the extracted first and second codes.
