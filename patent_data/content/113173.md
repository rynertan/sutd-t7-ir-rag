# Free falling, self locking adjustable tip assembly.

## Abstract
A free falling, self locking adjustable tip assembly in a safety belt apparatus includes a tongue plate 28 insertable into a buckle 30 and a continuous retractable belt length 15 providing both a lap 42 portion and a shoulder 44 portion. The tip assembly through which the belt passes has a snubber slide 60 engaged with the tongue plate 34 and slidable relative thereto. When the belt is drawn by the passenger over his body, the belt shifts the snubber 60 slide rearward on the tongue plate 34 to where the belt 42 is firmly gripped between a surface of the tongue plate a surface of the snubber slide, whereby that portion of the belt which extends across the passenger s lap cannot expend. When the belt is retracted so that a run of the belt is substantially vertical, the weight of the tip assembly 28 causes its front end to tip downward causing the slide to fall forward along the tongue plate 34 releasing its grip on the belt, whereby the tip assembly freely falls to a lower position along the vertical belt run. To prevent the belt from miscentering and twisting within the tip assembly, the snubber slide 60 has a pair of parallel tracks to guide the belt 44 through the tip assembly.
