# Antenna device.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an antenna device, which comprises a reflec tor 10 and a primary radiator for an ARSR system including a low beam horn antenna 22 disposed at a position substantial ly at the focal point of the reflector 10 and a high beam horn antenna 24 disposed below the low beam horn antenna 22 . The antenna device further comprises a primary radiator for an SSR system including two modified diagonal horns 26, 28 provided on opposite sides of and having outside perimeters complementary to the arrangement of the low and high beam horn antennas 22, 24 and at positions corresponding to a po sition midway between the low and high beam horn antennas 22, 24 . A yagi antenna 30 used as a part of the SSR radiator, is disposed above the low beam horn antenna 22 . Thus, the antenna device can be used commonly for both the ARSR and SSR systems.
