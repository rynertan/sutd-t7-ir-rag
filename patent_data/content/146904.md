# COMPOSITE THICKENING AGENT

## Abstract
A composite thickening agent comprising two or more thickening agents of different sensitivity to ions and a component which is ionizable in water, indicated here as ionic component . The thickening agent components are selected and proportioned so that each one, being sensitive to a different degree of ionic concentration, has a different thickening action in the presence of different levels of dilution. In practice the less sensitive ones work at greater ionic concentration, the more sensitive ones at higher levels of dilution lower ionic concentration . In this way the composite thickening agent allows the viscosity of an ionic solution or suspension to be kept relatively constant during the entire process of dilution.
