# COATINGS FOR CUTTING BLADES

## Abstract
An edge cutting implement is provided with a refractory material coating e.g. of titanium nitride by a coating technique such as sputter ion plating. The coating technique is carried out under conditions such that the coating terminates adjacent a cutting edge of the implement, e.g. 1 2 mm from the cutting edge. Thus, the cutting edge is not covered by the refractory material. A cutting implement so coated is found to possess improved cutting performance compared with a similar but uncoated implement or with a similar implement where the cutting edge is coated. Also, use of titanium nitride as the refractory material imparts a decorative golden colour to the imple ment.
