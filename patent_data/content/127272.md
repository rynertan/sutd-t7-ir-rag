# Focusing magnetron sputtering apparatus.

## Abstract
A cathode assembly 10 for use in a magnetron sputter ing system, the system having a cathode assembly with paral lel elongated target segments 74, 75 which are formed sub stantially of a material which is desired to be sputter deposited onto a substrate. The elongated target segments are each provided with a material removal surface which is inclined toward the other segment with respect to the plane of the substrate. Such inclination permits the material which is removed from the target bars to be focussed onto a relatively narrow area, thereby improving the efficiency of the sputter ing operation and reducing machine down time for cleaning and vacuum pumping. End target segments 66, 67 are pro vided for improving the efficiency of film deposition near the ends of the elongated bars. The end target segments are provided with material removal surfaces which are also inclined, and connect with the elongated target segments to form a rectangular frame arrangement. An elongated inner pole piece 71 has outwardly extending portions 99 near each end to improve uniformity of a trapping magnetic field between the inner pole piece and a rectangular annular outer pole piece.
