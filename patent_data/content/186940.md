# Wired and input stage fet logic gate.

## Abstract
A logic gate for use as a fundamental building block in more complex digital circuitry. The logic gate has multiple wired AND input circuits 72, 74 , each capable of accepting multiple inputs A, B C, D resp. , and each connected to a single pull up field effect transistor 76, 78 resp. , and to a common power supply Vp. The wired AND input circuits 72, 74 are ORed together and their signals level shifted by diodes 80, 82, 84 , before application to a FET output circuit 86 that has one gate terminal and multiple drain output ter minals. To facilitate expansion of the logic, these output ter minals are connectable, either singly or together with out puts from other similar gates, as inputs to similar gates. The logic gate of the invention has a very low parts count com pared with other logic topologies for the same purpose, and has an extremely favorable propagation delay power product.
