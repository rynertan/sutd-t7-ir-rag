# PROCESS FOR AUTOMATICALLY PAINTING PIECES FED IN ALONG A PROCESSING LINE AND APPARATUS CAPABLE OF PERFORMING THE SAME PROCESS

## Abstract
Process for automatically painting pieces fed in along a processing line which utilizes on the line itself at least a painting machine, such as a so called painting robot, prefer ably of the kind provided with an articulated arm, carrying a spraying device and controlled, by means of corresponding actuators and electrical position transducers, by an electro nic equipment suitable to store a number of predetermined processing procedures and to pilot the painting machine according to said procedures, so that said spraying device can be operated in space, time and mode according to a desired programming. Said painting machine can move with alternate back ward and forward motion in a direction parallel to the axis of the processing line and can vary its relative speed at will with respect to pieces to be painted.
