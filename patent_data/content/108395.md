# Opto mechanical cursor positioning device.

## Abstract
A hand held Mouse contains an optical system for detecting the number of patterns crossed by its movement across a periodic optical pattern. The optical system is limited to detecting the distance traveled by the mouse across the pattern, a mechanical displacement device within the mouse being utilized to detect the direction of move ment. Signals from the optical distance detector and the mechanical direction detector are combined to drive the cursor in a controlled direction across a cathode ray tube or other display device.
