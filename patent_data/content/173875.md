# Dynamic focus signal shaper.

## Abstract
A dynamic signal shaper for a cathode ray tube display system is described. In some cathode ray tubes an electro magnetic lens is driven by a correction signal derived from the beam deflection signals. The required correction signal is proportional to the product of the squares of the horizontal and vertical deflection signals. The described signal shaper incorporates means for making the constant of proportional ity independently adjustable for beam deflections in each corner of cathode ray tube screen.
