# Catalytic process for the production of ethanol.

## Abstract
A method for the selective, direct preparation of ethanol which comprises contacting a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen at a temperature of from 100 to 400 C and at a pressure of from 50 to 1000 bars with a catalyst comprising ruthenium and at least one other metal selected from Groups VII and VIII of the Periodic Table and a source of halide ions in a liquid medium comprising an aprotic amide or imide or an aprotic heterocyclic compound containing an OCO group ing in the ring.
