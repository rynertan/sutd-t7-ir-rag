# IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO FURNACES

## Abstract
The invention relates to a solid fuel furnace having a fixed grate and a grate mounted within the furnace chamber to rake the ash and fuel mechanically to remove clinker from the grate. The grate may be raked in strips by either one rake movable transversely or a plurality of separate rakes. Alternatively, the rake may be the full width of the grate and controlled to move the ash and live fuel by discreet increments.
