## Description
This invention has particular utility in a compiler in which optimization algorithms are used to improve the quality of the code. In particular, this invention improves the time to perform the optimizations known as common subexpression elimination and code motion. Further, this invention is intended to increase the effectiveness of the above mentioned optimizations. While the invention will find utility in optimizing compilers for all types of computers, it has particular significance for reduced instruction set computers, for which the code produced by compilers is often more voluminous than code produced for complex instruction set computers, because each instruction of a reduced instruction set computer is simpler and performs less function. There is more opportunity and need for optimization in code produced for a reduced instruction set computer. The quality of code produced by compilers has been an issue ever since the first compiler was produced. One of the principal objectives of IBM s FORTRAN I compiler, the first commercially available compiler, was to produce object code in the field of scientific computation which was comparable in code quality to that produced directly by assembly language programmers coding by hand . Today, higher level languages are designed to be used in every field in which computers are applicable. Even the original FORTRAN language has been bolstered to make it applicable to a wide range of programming tasks. However, it is still important that the quality of code produced by the compiler be high, especially if the resultant code is to be used in a production environment. Code produced by a skilled assembly language programmer is still the yardstick against which compiler produced code is measured. A large number of optimization techniques have been developed and refined since the 1950 s to improve the quality of compiler generated code. Indeed, many of these optimizations were known in principle, and used in some fashion by the team that produced the first FORTRAN compiler. Optimizations that are frequently employed in optimizing compilers include common sub expression elimination, moving code from regions of high execution frequency to regions of low execution frequency code motion , dead code elimination, reduction in strength replacing a slow operation by an equivalent fast operation , and constant propagation. Descriptions of these otpimizations can be found in J. T. Schwartz, E. Morel and C. Renvoise A. Aho, J. Ullman, Global common subexpression elimination and code motion are among the most important optimizations. Measurements have shown that these optimizations have a larger effect on code improvement than any of the other optimizations. Many articles in the literature discuss how to perform this optimization the first two of the above citations contain excellent accounts of how to determine where in a program, copy of code should be inserted in order to allow original code to become redundant and subject to elimination. These articles also describe how to determine where redundant code exists. The methods depend on the program s flow graph, and a knowledge of certain properties which can be determined by examining basic blocks one at a time. These properties are The above mentioned references describe how to perform global common subexpression elimination and code motion on the premise that the above mentioned sets are known for every basic block. In particular, these references describe how to compute the set of computations to be inserted at the end of certain basic blocks to achieve the effect of code motion, based on the sets, DEX, UEX, and THRU. These computations are well known to those skilled in the art. However, unless care is taken in computing UEX, DEX, and THRU, the commoning and code motion algorithms may only common and or move the first of a sequence of related computations. For example, consider the code fragment of TABLE I. It is easy not to put the computation of R102 Op 3 into UEX for a basic block consisting of the code in TABLE I because R100 and R101 may not have the same values on entering the basic block as they do when the U. S. Patent 4,309,756 discloses a method for evaluating certain logical computations. The disclosed concepts are narrow in scope and anachronistic for a patent issued in 1982. It is primarily background art in that it sheds no light on naming computations so that potentially redundant computations are given the same name. UK Patent 1,413,938 is concerned with techniques for testing compiler output for correctness. It could be used to test the correctness of code generated by an optimizing compiler. However, it bears no relevance to how the optimizing compiler generates code in general, or how it achieves its optimizations. U.S. Patent 4,277,826 uses hashing to maintain a virtual address translation mechanism. The present invention used hashing to quickly reference computations previously encountered in the compilation process. However, hashing is a minor detail in the embodiment of our invention. The present invention is defined in the attached claims. The present invention teaches deriving a basis for computations, and it is shown how expressing all computations in terms of basis elements enables global common subexpression elimination and code motion ot operate expeditiously. Copending application EP A 0171592, entitled A Method operable within an Optimizing Compiler teaches that under certain code generation strategies, a basis can be selected during the intermediate code generation process. It is not necessary to wait for code generation to be completed to determine a basis . In such cases, all computations can be expressed in terms of the basis immediately during intermediate code generation. The PL 1L compiler, which is discussed in Cocke, J. and Markstein, P., The term intermediate language as used herein is one used by the compiler to represent the program being translated. It is usually at a lower level than the source language and a higher level than the target language. Optimizing compilers transform intermediate language programs into equivalent, but better, intermediate language programs. It is to be understood that this phase of the compilation is known in the art and is not considered to be novel per se. It is described herein merely to complete the description of the present invention. This operation is performed in block 1 of FIG. 2. It is a primary object of the present invention to provide an optimizing compiler with a module which allows several related computations to be commoned or moved with a single pass of a commoning and code motion algorithm. It is a further object of the invention to utilize the concept of computing a basis for a program. All computations in the program can be expressed in terms of the basis elements. It is a further object of the invention to show how the basis of a program can be used to compute the set of upward exposed expressions, which is necessary to perform global commoning and code motion algorithms. The set of upward exposed expressions is computed, using the basis , in such a manner, as to allow several related computations to be commoned or moved with just one pass of a commoning or code motion algorithm. It is a further object of the invention to show how the basis of a program can be used to compute the set of downward exposed expressions, which is necessary to perform global commoning and code motion algorithms. The set of downward exposed expressions is computed, using the basis, in such a manner as to allow several related computations to be commoned or moved with just one pass of a commoning or code motion algorithm. It is further object of the invention to show how the basis of a program can be used to compute the set of unaffected computations, which is necessary to perform global commoning and code motion algorithms. The set of unaffected computations is computed, using the basis, in such a manner to allow several related computations to be commoned or moved with just one pass of a commoning or code motion algorithm. It is a further object of the invention to show how to compute the kill sets , which for each basis item are the non basis computations which depend on the value of the basis item. The set of upward exposed expressions, downward exposed expressions,and unaffected expressions are most readily computed in terms of the kill sets. It is a further object of the invention to show how to use the kill sets to propagate the set of available computations while examining the computations in a basic block for the purpose of removing redundant code. Those objects are achieved by the invention as defined in the appended claims. FIG. 1 is a very high level functional flowchart of an optimizing compiler in which the present invention has particular utility. FIG. 2 is a high level flowchart of the herein disclosed compiler module for effecting the desired commoning and code motion. FIG. 3 is a high level flowchart of the global common subexpression and code motion algorithm which is used in an optimizing compiler, and in which the present invention has utility. The present invention provides a mechanism which allows larger sets to be recognized for UEX, DEX and or THRU, and thus greater amounts of code can be commoned or moved with one application of the algorithm. The following is a bit of definition of a nubmer of terms used in the description of the present invention. To continue with the present description, take the following items as a computational basis Thus, basis elements can be determined as they are encountered, either because the use of a user variable was encounted, or a declaration of a user variable was encountered, or a user variable requires a descriptor at execution time, or references are made to heaps or stacks belonging to the run time environment, or the compiler must generate a distinguished temporary, or the compiler must make reference to object code i.e. a branch instruction . The figures which comprise the flowcharts of the present invention e.g. FIG. 3 are largely self explanatory. FIG. 1 is a very high level flowchart for a compiler as is well known in the art. Blocks 1, 2, 4 and 5 are quite straightforward and well known. Block 3 entitled Code Optimization is the phase of the compiler activity to which the present invention applies. FIG. 2 is a flowchart of the optimization phase for such an optimizing compiler. The operations performed in Blocks 1, 3 and 4 are straightforward and well known in the art. Block 2 is the area of the optimizing compiler to which the present invention applies. This block is shown expanded in FIG. 3. FIG. 3 is a flowchart for the global commoning and code motion phase of the compiler. As stated previously in the specification, this overall objective is well known in compiler design. The specific manner in which the operations are performed will be described subsequently in functional terms. Blocks 4, 5, 6 and 7 are generally known in the art of optimizing compilers as stated previously. The operations are described in terms of the functions performed in the following general description of the overall operation of the global common subexpression elimination and code motion phase of a typical optimizing compiler utilizing the present invention. Specific subprograms for performing these operations are set forth in Appendices I and III VI for convenience of reference. Appendices I and II comprise the subprograms which perform the operations delineated in Blocks 1, 2 and 3 of FIG. 3 which operations comprise the heart of the present invention. The method requires the following steps set forth for convenience of reference in an essentially tabular format Below, is a sample PL 1 program to illustrate our invention The numbers to the left of each line of PL 1 are merely for identification. After code generation, our compiler has produced the following code. In the intermediate language listing, the numbers to the left indicate which line of source code caused that line of intermediate language text to be generated. To make the code easier to follow, we point out that the RET operation marks the return from the subprogram. LHA and STHA are half word load from memory and store to memory, respectively. LR copies the contents of the right operand into the contents of the left operand it is mnemonic for Load Register . BF is mnemonic for Branch on False. It causes flow of control to go to the label specified in the last operand based if a bit in the register specified by the first operand is zero. The bit to be examined is given by the second operand. As used in the example, the CI instruction followed by the BF cause control to flow to label 3 if the contents of R100 is not greater than 10. The other operation codes are self evident to those skilled in the art, and in the intermediate language notation, the leftmost operand is the result of performing the operation indicated, on the Following p.9 step 1 of the disclosure, we determine the basis to be Following step 2 of the disclosure, we find the following dependencies for each non basis item Performing step 3 gives us the following kill sets for the basis items The sets DEX, UEX, and THRU are then determined for the basic blocks by step 4, yielding Following the algorithm suggested in step 5, the sets AVAIL and THRU, and the auxilliary sets GDX, GUX, PAX, CIE, and CIX are calculated to be As a result of performing code insertion as described in step 5, and redundant code elimination as described in step 6, the program which follows is obtained. Lines with identification 9999 are lines of code which result from the code insertion program. Compare this intermediate code program with the one above to see the change in the program To see the advantage of the present invention, if the commoning and code motion algorithm had been applied without the concepts of basis and kill sets, DEX, UEX, and THRU might have been determined to be As a consequence, only instructions to compute R100 and R111 would have been candidates for code motion. The program would transform to Notice that five instructions were left inside the loop. Three additional applications of the commoning and code motion process would be required without the present invention to achieve the same result that the procedure of the present invention achieved in one application of the commoning and code motion algorithm. The following is a brief mathematical description of the use of UEX, DEX and THRU lists. More particularly, it discusses the function of the AVAIL and INSERT lists and their use in producing the final output from the procedure set forth in FIG. 3. For each basic block B, it is necessary to determine the following sets of computations, from UEX, DEX, and THRU The references cited previously give several techniques for computing AVAIL and INSERT from UEX, DEX, and THRU. There are several different criteria for deciding when to move code. The reader is advised to consult all the references cited previously to get several different points of view. To make the present invention self contained, Morel and Renvoise s method will be followed for computing AVAIL and INSERT. The reader is urged to read their paper for justification of their method. To compute AVAIL and INSERT five auxilliary sets of computations are introduced for each basic block The equations which define these sets of computations are as follows One method for solving these equations is to initialize gux b and pax b to the empty set for all basic blocks b, and to initialize gdx b to the set of all computations for all basic blocks except for the entry basic block, for which gdx entry basic block is initialised to the empty set. The entry basic block represents the code which is executed when control first enters the program being compiled. Equations 1 , 2 , and 3 are each solved by recomputing gux b , gdx b , and pax b respectively, repeatedly for all basic blocks, until recomputation does not change the sets for any of the basic blocks. Having calculated gux b , gdx b , and pax b for all basic blocks b, we next solve equations 4 and 5 concurrently. Initialize pie b and pix b to the set of all expressions with two exceptions. pie entry block and pix exit block are initialized to the empty set. Then repeatedly recompute both pix b and pie b from equations 4 and 5 for all basic blocks b until recomputation does not change the sets for any of the basic blocks. Finally, insert b and avail b can be computed directly from equations 6 and 7 using uex b and thru b , and the results of having computed gdx b , pix b and pie b . The following table concisely relates to the Appendices I thru VI to the blocks of FIG. 3. These subprograms code fragments are written in PL 1 code and are sufficiently annotated as to allow any skilled programmers to utilize the present invention in an optimizing compiler in either the form shown or to easily rewrite the subprograms in another target language which would be more compatible with his compiler. As stated previously the programs set forth in Appendices I and II represent the subject matter of the present invention as set forth in Blocks 1, 2 and 3 of FIG. 3 and the remaining Appendices II thru VI represent programs which perform the operations specified in Blocks 4 thru 7 of FIG. 3.
