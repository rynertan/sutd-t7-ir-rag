# Isomerisation of alkyl aromatics using a gallium containing aluminosilicate catalyst.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a process for the hydrocatalytic treatment of a hydrocarbon feedstock which is a mixture of alkyl aromatics containing at least one di or polymethyl benzene and an alkyl benzene selected from ethyl benzene, methyl ethyl benzene and propylbenzene by contacting the mixture at 300 to 500 C, a pressure of 0 to 100 bars gauge and in the presence of hydrogen with a gallium containing aluminosilicate catalyst and recovering the desired product. The aluminosilicate has a silica to alumina ratio of between 10 1 and 100 1 on a molar bases. The xylene products are useful raw materials as such or for making the corresponding dicarboxylic acids.
