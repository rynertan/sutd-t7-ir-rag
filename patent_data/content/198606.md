# Metal product fabrication.

## Abstract
A metal matrix composite e.g. of SiC in a metal alloy is made by the steps of atomising a stream of molten metal to form a spray of hot metal particles by subjecting the stream to relatively cold gas directed at the stream, applying to the stream or spray relatively cold solid particles of a material of dif ferent composition from the metal, and depositing the metal having the particles incorporated therein. The deposit is made into a shaped metal matrix composite by reheating it to a controlled temperature above the solidus of the metal, the temperature being such that the deposit possesses sufficient fluidity for it to be gravity or pressure cast, and casting the fluid deposit to give the shaped product. The temperature is preferably above the liquidus of the metal, for example substantially above the liquidus.
