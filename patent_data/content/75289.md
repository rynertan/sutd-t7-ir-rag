# Process for making allylic esters of tetrabromophthalic acid.

## Abstract
Allylic esters of tetrabromophthalic acid are formed using allylic alcohol both as a reactant and a solvent. In the first step, the alcohol and a base are reacted with tetrabromophthalic anhydride to form the half ester so dium salt, in the second step, the half ester sodium salt is reacted with allylic halide to form the diester which crystallizes from solution. The excess solvent may be treated to recover the raw materials or recycled.
