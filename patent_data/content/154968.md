# MARINE SEISMIC PROSPECTING METHOD AND SYSTEM

## Abstract
Multiple marine robot vehicles adapted to tow seismic streamer cables are advanced along parallel paths under remote control from a mother seismic exploration vessel so as to develop a pattern of marine seismic profiles in either 2 D or 3 D density. Command and control may be provided by acoustic links to enable deeply submerged or under ice operation of such robots.
