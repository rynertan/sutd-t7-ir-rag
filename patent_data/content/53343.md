# Reproducing and amplifying circuit for magnetoresistive head.

## Abstract
A reproducing and amplifying circuit for a mag netoresistive head 10 comprises an amplifying circuit 30, 40, 50, 51, 52 with a feedback circuit 31, 70, 90 . The head is connectable with the feedback circuit so that the head is supplied with a drive current by the amplifying circuit and that a reproduced electric signal outputed by the head is coupled to the amplifying circuit for amplification. A magnetoresistive element 70, 80, 90 may be provided in the amplifying circuit to effect temperature compensation for the head. The reproducing and amplifying circuit is simple in structure, has an enhanced signal to noise ratio and is immune to temperature variation.
