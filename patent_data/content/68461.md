## Description
HIGH VINYLIDENE CHLORIDE CONTENT INTERPOLYMER COATING RESINS AND METHOD OF PREPARATION The homopolymer of vinylidene chloride is generally insoluble at room temperature in such organic solvents às tetrahydrofuran. However, when vinylidene chloride is interpolymerized with one or more copolymerizable monomers, useful materials result which may be soluble at room temperature in organic solvents.Typical copolymerizable monomers include acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, methyl. acrylate or other C2 C15 alcohol esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid, e.g., methyl methacrylate , acrylic acid, itaconic acid, chloroacrylonitrile, vinyl chloride, vinyl bromide, and vinylidene bromide. Particularly, useful organic solvents include mixtures of toluene and tetrahydrofuran. These materials find particular use in the cellophane industrv where a verv thin usuallv about 0.00127 0.00381 mm 0.05 0.15 mil coating of a so called soluble vinylidene chloride copolymer resin is deposited from a solvent, or mixture of solvents, on both sides of a cellophane film to serve as a water vapor barrier film.In addition, the coating promotes retention of water, thus helping to prevent brittle fracture of the film and also provide a heat sealable outer coating For manufacturers concerned with applying such thin coatings to substrates such as cellophane, the solubility of a polymer in a solvent and the water vapor transmission rate WVTR of a coated substrate are particularly importantproperties Usually the desired properties include as low a WVTR as possible coupled with low temperature solubility of the polymer in an inexpensive solvent or solvent mixture. The WVTR of vinylidene chloride interpolymers is directly related to the mole percent of vinylidene chloride in the interpolymer. Therefore, it is generally advartageous to get the mole percent of vinylidene chloride as high as possible consistent with solubility in one or more desired organic solvent systems However, a high vinylidene chloride content generally means that strong crystallizing forces are present in the interpolymer reducing solubility. As the mole percent of vinylidene chloride is raised in an interpolymer series, the interpolymers change from products which crystallize slowly, are amorphous and dissolve readily, to interpolymers which crystallize rapidly and are highly crystalline and much more difficult to dissolve. A small amount of interpolymeric composition variation can result in interpolymers unsuitable for coating purposes because they fail to dissolve adequately in a solvent system or because they crystallize out of solution after initially dissolving Careful control of solution turbidity, hereinafter called haze , as measured in terms of percent light transmission is essential to use of these interpolymers for coating purposes.It has been found that excessively slow crystallization rates result in blocking during machine operations when a coated film is wound in large rolls before crystallization is generally complete. Blocking , as used herein, is the tendency of the interpolymer coating to adhere to another coated layer. When blocking is particularly severe, it may not be possible to unwind a roll of coated film. A combination of choice of monomers and method of polymerization thereof has now been discovered which is believed to be superior to anything known heretofore for attainment of optimum combined barrier and solubility properties. The resulting interpolymer having polymerized therein vinylidene chloride, methyl methacrylate, itaconic acid and a comonomer selected from the group consisting of acrylonitrile, methacrylic acid and methacrylonitrile have a high vinylidene chloride content, a narrow composition range, and enhanced solubility in organic solvents. They also provide a low permeability to moisture and to oxygen and a good crystallization rate for a film cast from an interpolymer solution. It has now surprisingly been found that interpolymers, having polymerized therein vinylidene chloride, methyl methacrylate, itaconic acid and comonomer selected from the group consisting of acrylonitrile, methacrylic acid and methacrylonitrile, which have a high vinylidene chloride content result from a process for preparing, in aqueous emulsion, controlled zinterpolymer compositions having polymerized therein a from 86 to 92 mole percent vinylidene chloride b from 14 to 8 mole percent of a mixture of methyl methacrylate and a comonomer selected from the group consisting of acrylonitrile, methacrylic acid and methacrylonitrile, said mixture of methyl methacrylate and the comonomer having a molar ratio of the comonomer to methyl methacrylate of from 0.2 1 to 5 1 and c from 0.5 to 1.0 weight percent itaconic acid based on weight of a plus b said interpolymer compositions having a relative viscosity of from about 1.3 to 1.7 at 25 C as a 1 percent solution in tetrahydrofuran said interpolymer compositions being capable of forming generally haze free solutions when present in an amount of 20 percent solids in a solvent mixture comprising 65 weight percent tetrahydrofuran and 35 weight percent toluene, based on solvent mixture weight, by a process comprising the sequential steps of A initiating emulsion polymerization by forming a seed latex, the seed latex being formed in a batch emulsion polymerization process which comprises 1 adding a first monomer charge to an aqueous emulsion polymerization medium, the first monomer charge comprising from 3 to 8 weight percent of a principal mixture of monomers, comprising from 86 to 92 mole percent vinylidene chloride and from 14 to about 8 mole percent of a comonomer mixture of methyl methacrylate and a comonomer selected from the group consisting of acrylonitrile, methacrylic acid and methacrylo nitrile, said comonomer mixture having a molar ratio of the comonomer to methyl methacrylate of from 02 1 to 5 1, the polymerization medium comprising water, an emulsifier and from 0.5 to 1.0 weight percent itaconic acid based on the principal mixture of monomers 2 adding a polymerization initiator to said emulsion polymerization medium, at a generally constant rate 3 continuing seed latex formation under autogenous pressure until a pressure drop in vapor. pressure of monomers in the polymerization medium of from 12.4 to 15.2 kPa occurs B continuing polymerization under autogenous pressure by adding to the emulsion polymerization medium 1 a second monomer charge in an amount between 85 and 92 weight percent of the principal mixture of monomers as in A 1 , said second monomer charge being added at a constant rate, the rate being sufficient to continually provide an excess of unreacted monomers in the polymerization medium, said excess being from 2 to 10 weight percent based on weight of the polymerization medium and 2 the polymerization initiator at the same constant rate of addition as in A 2 and. C following addition of all of the second monomer charge, finishing polymerization in a predetermined time interval T, the time interval T having at least a first portion and a second portion, by 1 continuing to add the polymerization initiator at the same constant rate of addition as in A 2 and B 2 , the initiator being added throughout the time interval T and 2 adding a third monomer charge in an amount between 2 and 12 weight percent of the principal mixture of monomers as in A 1 said third monomer charge being added over the first portion of the time interval T in such a manner that the vapor pressure of monomers in the emulsion polymerization medium is reduced smoothly as refiected by a time pressure curve wherein time is plotted on the abscissa and pressure is plotted on the ordinate, the time pressure curve being generally free of discontinuities from the beginning of the time interval T to the end thereof and having a shape, the shape being that of a line which is concave downward Also within the scope of the present invention are the polymers prepared in accordance with this process Included is a crystalline, controlled composition interpolymer having polymerized therein a from 86 to 92 mole percent vinylidene chloride b from 14 to 8 mole percent of a comonomer mixture of methyl methacrylate and a comonomer selected from the group consisting of acrylonitrile, methacrylic acid and methacrylonitrile said comonomer mixture having a molar ratio of the comonomer to methyl methacrylate of from 0.5 1 to 2 1 and c from 0.5 to 1.0 weight percent itaconic acitibased on weight of a plus b said interpolymer having a relative viscosity of from 1.3 to 1.7 at 250C as a 1 percent solution in tetrahydrofuran said interpolymer being capable of forming haze free solutions when present in an amount of 20 percent solids in a solvent mixture as measured in terms of at least 80 percent transmission of the solution using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer operating at a wavelength of 640 nanometers against a reference of pure solvent mixture after aging the solution at 250C for a period of 24 hours, said solvent mixture comprising 65 weight percent tetrahydrofuran and 35 weight percent toluene, based on solvent mixture weight. Figures 1 and 2 are time pressure curves showing vapor pressure of monomers in the reactor as a function of time. Figure 1 is a partial reproduction of a chart of pressure transducer readings taken during the polymerization of monomers in Example 1, Experiment A.Figure 2 is a partial reproduction of a chart of pressure transducer readings taken during the polymerization of monomers in Example 2, Experiment D. In Figures 1 and 2, the vertical axis represents pressure and the horizontal axis reflects time in hours. The horizontal axis in Figures 1 and 2 is not a straight linear progression but contains a portion where the time scale is expanded. Steps I, II and III of the polymerization processes are so labeled onFigures 1 and 2. The charts of pressure transducer readings of Figures 1 and 2 are generally smooth lines.The lines do, however, contain minor variations which result in a fsawtooth appearance normal for polymerization apparatus wherein there is a time lag between a temperature increase and a response by a cooling medium control. The monomers are polymerized using a three step aqueous emulsion process. Step I focuses on the formation of a seed latex. A first monomer charge of from 3 to 8 weight percent of a principal mixture of monomers is added during Step I. The principal mixture of monomers comprises from 86 to 92 mole percent vinylidene chloride, and from 14 to 8 mole percent of comonomer mixture of methyl methacrylate and a comc,nomer selected from the group consisting of acrylonitrile, methacrylic acid and methacrylonitrile. The comonomer mixture has a molar ratio of the comonomer to methyl methacrylate of from 0.2 1 to 5 1.Step II focuses on the simultaneous and continuous addition of monomers.A second monomer charge of from 85 to 92 weight percent of the principal mixture of monomers is added duringStep II. A portion of the principal mixture of monomers must remain after the Steps I and II to be added as a third monomer charge. Step III focuses on finishing polymerization. The third monomer charge, from 2 to 12 weight percent of the principal mixture of monomers, is added according to a specific monomer feeding schedule.The schedule calls for the third monomer charge to be added in at least two incremental steps. A polymerization initiator is added at a generally constant rate throughout all three steps. Step I is essentially a small batch polymerization. In a batch polymerization, polymer composition is likely to vary because of unequal reactivity ratios among the monomers. Therefore, it is essential thatStep II be started as soon as the seed latex shows signs of polymer composition variation as indicated by a pressure drop in the polymerization apparatus. The pressure drop is a drop in vapor pressure of monomers in the reaction mixture. If the transition from Step I to Step II is late, e.g., after a pressure drop of more than 12.4 to 15 2 kPa enough polymer composition change may occur to produce an unsatisfactory interpolymer which is insoluble or yields solutions having an unsatisfactory haze value. With regard to Step II, prior known processes for preparing interpolymers of this type e.g., the process of U.S. Patent 3,87 9,359 require that the monomers be added to the polymerization reaction medium, in the proper ratios, as fast as they are polymerized.As such, there is generally very little excess monomer present at any time within the polymerization medium to prevent polymer composition change and a resultant loss in WVTR and solubility characteristics. In another process, the monomers must be added in two stages during the second step. In a first stage, the monomers must be added at a rate sufficient to continually provide an excess of monomers in the polymerization medium. In a second stage, remaining monomers must be added at a rate sufficient to continually ensure an absence of excess monomers in the polymerization medium.The latter process is disclosed as being critical for providing coatings having adequate flexibility. It has now been unexpectedly found that interpolymers having the combination of properties required by the present invention are formed when from 85 to 92 percent of the total monomeric materials, excluding the itaconic acid, is added in a generally constant ratio and rate throughout Step II. The rate must be sufficient to provide an excess of unreacted monomers in the polymerization medium of 1 to 10 weight percent based on weight of the polymerization medium.the amount of unreacted monomer is generally greatest near the beginning of Step II and least near the end ofStep II. With regard to Step III, the process of U.S.Patent 3,879,359 requires that the polymerization reaction be continued after all monomers have been added until about a 50 percent drop in reaction pressure occurs Immediately thereafter the reaction medium must be cob led and the unreacted monomer removed to control copolymer composition change in a batch system. Such a process provided minimum WVTR and maximum resin solubility when properly carried out. A second process requires the further addition of an ethylenically unsaturated comonomer and a polymerization initiator to prevent undesirable interpolymer composition change. It has now been unexpectedly found that interpolymers having the combination of properties required by the present invention are formed when a portion of the principal mixture of monomers is added during Step III. The portion is from two to twelve weight percent based on the principal mixture of mono ners Also, by incrementally reducing the rate of monomer addition of the third monomer charge from the rate of monomer addition during Step II in at least two incremental steps while maintaining the rate of initiator addition, the vapor pressure of monomers in the free space decreases gradually.The resulting interpolymer produced by incrementally reducing the rate of monomer addition during Step III is surprisingly soluble when compared to an interpolymer of generally identical composition prepared in the same manner except that monomer addition is stopped at the end of Step II. A time pressure curve representing the polymerization wherein monomer addition is stopped at the end of Step II has a characteristic Step III shape shown in Figure 2 that is generally concave upward when pressure is plotted on the ordinate and time is plotted on the abscissa. By way of contrast, a time pressure curve for Step III when monomer addition is incrementally reduced is generally concave downward when pressure is plotted on the ordinate and time is plotted on the abscissa as shown in Figure 1. Step III continues for a time interval T which varies in accordance with 1 the interpolymer which is being polymerized and 2 the amount and ratio of mixed monomers remaining at the end of the second step. Particularly desirable results have been obtained with a time interval T of about 1 hours. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that satisfactory results are obtained when the time interval T is other than 1 hours. As such, the time interval of 1l 2 hours is not to be taken by way of limitation. It has been found that suitable results are obtained when two incremental steps are used to reduce the rate of monomer addition during Step III from that of Step II. In the first incremental step, a first reduced rate of addition is maintained for a first fractional part of the time interval T. The first reduced rate of addition must be less than the rate of monomer addition during the second step, or Step II.In the second incremental step, a second reduced rate of addition is maintained for a second fractional part of the time interval T. The second reduced rate of addition must be less than the first reduced rate of addition. More than two incremental reductions in the rate of monomer addition from the rate of monomer addition during Step II may be made. Particularly, beneficial results are obtained when the time intervalT also has a third fractional part wherein only the polymerization initiator is added to the polymerization medium. Desirable results are obtained when 1 the first fractional part of the time interval T is aboutT 6 2 the second fractional part of the time intervalT is about T 3 3 the third fractional part of the time interval T is about T 2 4 the first reduced rate of addition is about one half the rate of monomer addition of Step II and 5 the second reduced rate of addition is about one fourth the rate of monomer addition of Step II. The three step process is necessary to provide satisfactory interpolymers in accordance with the present invention. Interpolymers having the same general composition as those of the present invention but which are produced without adding a portion of the principal mixture of monomers during Step III are unsatisfactory for purposes of the present invention because of poor solubility or excessive haze arising it is believed from the formation of too much high vinylidene chloride content interpolymer during Step III.Similar interpolymers containing from 86 to 92 mole percent vinylidene chloride may also be produced by a conventional batch emulsion polymerization with all of the monomers added at the start of polymerization are generally not sufficiently soluble in low cost solvents to provide useful coatings for substrates such as cellophane. It is recognized that each of the monomeric materials polymerized to form the interpolymers of the present invention has a characteristic reactivity ratio with respect to each of the other monomeric materials.Such characteristic reactivity ratios are well known in the art. In general, methyl methacrylate and the comonomer which is selected from the group consisting of acrylonitrile, methacrylic acid and methacrylonitrile both enter the interpolymer faster than vinylidene chloride while itaconic acid enters slower Accordingly, the present invention requires that all of the itaconic acid be added during Step I rather than added in the same manner as the primary mixture of monomers. Because of the differing reactivity ratios, it is believed that the vinylidene chloride content of the interpolymer increases as the emulsion polymerization proceeds toward completion. At some point as the vinylidene chloride content of the interpolymer increases, the interpolymer ceases to be soluble in a given solvent system such as a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and toluene in a weight ratio of 65 35. Insolubility of.an interpolymer which initially dissolves in a solvent system, is manifest as crystallization which causes the solution to be hazy. The onset of insolubility varies with solvent strength. There will be, however, a threshold level at which solutions of the interpolymer are not stable. This threshold may be called the haze threshold . Beneficially, the interpolymers prepared by the present invention do not develop hazy solutions upon standing for 24 hours at 250 Centigrade OC after dissolving for a period of about 30 minutes in a solvent system which is maintained at a temperature of about 300C Desirably, the interpolymers prepared in accordance with the present invention are capable of forming generally haze free solutions when present in an amount of from about 5 to 20 weight percent solids based on weight of solids plus solvent. The solvent system is desirably a blend of tetrahydrofuran and toluene in a weight ratio of tetrahydrofuran to toluene of 65 35.Such generally haze free solutions desirably have a haze value of at least 80 percent transmission. Haze values are measured in terms of percent transmission of visible light of the solution, after the solution has been aged for a period of 24 hours at a temperature of 250C, against a reference of the solvent. system. Haze values may be obtained by using an ultraviolet spectraphotometer operating at a wavelength of 640 nanometers.Preferably, such generally haze free solutions have a haze value of at least 85 percent transmission. The interpolymers prepared in accordance with the present invention beneficially have a relative viscosity of from 1.3 to 1.7 at 250C as a 1 percent solution in tetrahydrofuran. Said interpolymers beneficially have the following properties when deposited as a coating with a coating weight of 4 grams per square meter a a minimum heat seal temperature of from 700C to. 1400C b a water vapor transmission rate of no greater than 3.9 grams m2 24 hours at 380C c an oxygen transmission rate of no greater than 4.6 cubic centimeters of oxygen m2 Z4 hours l atmosphere of oxygen at 250C d a crystallization ratio at 15 minutes at 800C of from about 0.5 to about 2.The interpolymers desirably have a minimum heat seal temperature of from 950C to 1300C when deposited as a coating with a coating weight of 4 grams per square meter. The interpolymers of the present invention are prepared desirably from a principal mixture of monomers and itaconic acid. The principal mixture of monomers comprises from 86 to 92 mole percent vinylidene chloride and from 14 to 8 mole percent of a comonomer mixture of methyl methacrylate and a comonomer selected from the group consisting of acrylonitrile, methacrylic acid and methacrylonitrile. The amount of itaconic acid is and from 0.5 to 1.0 weight percent itaconic acid based on the principal mixture of monomers. The comonomer mixture has a molar ratio of methacrylic acid to methyl methacrylate of. from 0.2 1 to 5 1. Interpolymers containing less than 0.5 weight percent itaconic acid provide inadequate coating adhesion when the interpolymer is applied as a lacquer coating to a substrate such as dellophane.Amounts of itaconic acid in excess of about 1.0 weight percent based on the primary mixture of monomers may be used. However, such amounts are not required for sufficient adhesion and are accordingly uneconomical. It has been found that in a short time duringStep II, the amount of unreacted monomers in the polymerization medium drops rapidly from a high level of about 10 weight percent based on weight of the polymerization medium to a low level of about 1 to 2 weight percent. The short time interval will be referred to as the shift interval. Placement of the shift interval within Step II depends upon a number of factors. Such factors include 1 amount of latex solids 2 desired interpolymer molecular weight and 3 desired interpolymer solution viscosity. Desirably, the amount of latex solids to be produced is in the range of from about 50 to 56 weight percent based on weight of the latex. The polymerization time measured from the beginning of Step I to the end of Step III is desirably about 5 to 20 hours. Polymerization intervals of less than about 5 hours may be used but may require the use of complex cooling apparatus. Polymerization times of more than about 20 hours are possible but usually uneconomical. In Step I, the emulsion polymerization medium is beneficially heated to a temperature of 300 to 800C, preferably about 500 to 600C, and most preferably 500C. In Steps II and III, polymerization is respectively continued and finished at a temperature beneficially within the range of from 300 to 800C and desirably, from about 500 to 60 C. Particularly, beneficial results are obtained when polymerization temperatures are maintained within a tolerance of j0.50C These temperature limitations for each of the three steps of the process are important. If the shift interval occurs too early during Step II, an interpolymer which is too soluble will be produced. That is, the interpolymer will not crystallize. If the shift interval occurs too late during Step II an interpolymer which is generally insoluble will be produced. A desirable time interval for Step II is about 5 to 15 hours. Conventional amounts and types of emulsifiers and other additives may be used in preparing the interpolymers of the present invention. Such emulsifiers and other additives must not interfere with, or significantly alter, the reaction mechanism or the final interpolymer prescribed herein. Also, small amounts of other monomeric materials may be added before, during, or after the prescribed polymerization reaction. Such additives and other monomers must not significantly alter, the reaction mechanism or the final interpolymer prescribed herein. Conventional amounts of reduction oxidation hereinafter redox initiators may be used in preparing the interpolymers of the present invention. A preferred redox initiator is t butyl hydroperoxide sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate mixture wherein the sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate is generally added in excess. The amount of initiator used varies over a broad range and depends largely upon the type and concentration of the initiator as well as the desired interpolymer molecular weight. As noted above, the emulsion polymerization initiator is desirably added at a generally constant rate throughout the emulsion polymerization sufficient to produce interpolymers in accordance with the present invention. The following examples, wherein all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise stated, illustrate the present invention.Example 1 A. Preparation of Vinylidene Chloride VDC Methyl Methacrylate MMA Methacrylic Acid MAA Itaconic Acid IA Interpolymer According to the Present Invention A VDC MMA MAA IA interpolymer was prepared by emulsion polymerization in a 3 liter glass pipe reactor equipped with an agitator and metering pumps. Step I Initiating Polymerization The initial water phase charged to the reactor was as follows 1425 grams of deionized water 18 grams emulsifier 80 active a dihexyl ester of sodium sulfo succinic acid commercially available under the trade designation Aerosol MA from American Cyanamid Company. 13 grams itaconic acid .70 weight based on the total weight of the VDC MMAXMAA monomer mixture added during polymerization The initial water phase was added to the reactor. The reactor was then evacuated, purged w ith gaseous nitrogen and tacuated a second time. A monomer mixture comprising the following ingredients was prepared 1898 grams 90 mole VDC 109 grams 5 mole MMA 92 grams 5 mole MMA An oxidizing solution was prepared by diluting 11.1 grams of 7 percent t butyl hydroperoxide TBHP to 500 grams with deionized water. A reducing solution was similarly prepared by diluting 4.1 grams of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate to 500 grams with deionized water. Following the second evacuation of the reactor, the reactor was heated to a temperature of about 550C while stirring at a rate of about 250 revolutions per minute rpm . The rate of stirring was maintained at about 250 rpm throughout all three steps. About 73 grams of the monomer mixture was then pumped into the reactor as rapidly as possible. Addition of the oxidizing and reducing solutions was then started. The oxidizing and reducing solutions were each added by pumping, through separate pumps, at a rate of about 10 grams per hour. As such, the oxidizing and reducing solutions were mixed in the reactor. The seed latex reaction was allowed two proceed until there was a drop in pressure from the maximum pressure attained during Step I of about 13.8 kPa.Step I lasted for an interval, beginning with addition of the oxidizing and reducing solutions and ending with the drop in pressure of about 13.8 kPa, of about one hour. Step II Continuous Addition Generally, immediately following the pressure drop, addition of the monomer mixture was started at a rate of about 130 grams per hour. The 130 gram per hour rate of addition was maintained for about 13 hours. As such, a total 0,jf about 1722 grams of the monomer mixture was added during Step II. Addition of the oxidizing and reducing solutions, each at a rate of about 10 grams per hour, was continued throughout StepII. Step III Finishing Generally, immediately following completion of monomer mixture addition in Step II, finishing was started. In Step III, the monomer mixture was added in accordance with the following schedule 1 addition of monomer mixture at a rate of about 65 grams hour for b hour and 2 addition of monomer mixture at a rate of about 32 grams hour for hour. Addition of the oxidizing and reducing solutions, each at a rate of about 10 grams per hour, was continued throughout Step III.Step III lasted for an additional 3 4 hour after completion of monomer mixture addition. As such, Step III lasted for about 1 hours. At the end of Step III, addition of the oxidizing and reducing solutions was stopped. The reactor was then cooled to ambient temperature. The latex was then recovered as detailed below. B. Recovery of the Polymer from the Latex The interpolymer was recovered from the latex by coagulation in calcium chloride CaC12 . 35 Cubic centimeters cc of a 32 Caul2 solution were added to 1000 cc of water to form a solution. The solution was then heated to a temperature of about 400C. Thereafter 200 cc of the latex produced in A above were added to the mixture with stirring at a rate of about 250 rpm.An additional amount of 1000 cc of water was then added to the mixture. The mixture was then slowly heated to a temperature of about 800C and held at that temperature for about 2 hours while continuing stirring at a rate of about 250 rpm. The slurry was then quenched with ice The polymer was collected and washed with a spray of water for 10 minutes in a centrifuge. The interpolymer was then dried to a powder form containing less than about 2 water. The interpolymer was then ready for evaluation. C. Test for Solubility of the Interpolymer Haze Stability The haze or tubidity of 19.5 percent interpolymer solids in a 65 35 weight ratio tetrahydrofuran toluene THF Tol solvent mixture was measured using a BeckmanModel 25 Ultraviolet Spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 640 nanometers nm . Haze values are reported as percent transmission. The lower the transmission value, the more turbid or hazy the solution. D. Testing Coating Performance 1. Preparation of coated film Coating tests were conducted on an oriented polyester film. The film was coated with a 19.5 percent interpolymer solids lacquer solution using a 65 35 weight ratio THF Tol mixture as the solvent. The coating weight was about 4 grams square meter. The coated film was aged for 16 hours at a temperature of 600C to ensure development of crystallinity before testing the coating. 2. Measuring permeability to water vapor Permeability to water vapor WVTR was measured using an infrared diffusometer, commercially available from Reigel Mocon Modern Controls under the designationModel IRD 2. The data are reported as grams of water per square meter per 24 hours at 380C for a coating weight of 4 grams per square meter. 3. Testing for minimum heat seal temperature A Robot automatic controlled, air operated jaw sealer was used for making seals so that minimum heat seal temperature MHST could be measured. Heat seals were made at 5 degree intervals between 950C and 1350C using 138 kPa jaw pressure and dwell time of 1 second The MHST is the temperature at which coating deformation is first observed when the seal is torn apart. 4. Measuring permeability to oxygen Permeability to oxygen O2TR wds measured using an oxygen diffusometer commercially available from Riegel Mocon Modern Controls under the designation Oxtzcn Model 1050. The data are reported as cubic centimeters cc of oxygen per square meter per 24 hours per one atmosphere of oxygen at 250C for the coating weight of 4 grams per square meter. 5. Determining the crystallization ratio at 15 minutes at 800C A 15 percent solution of the interpolymer in a solvent mixture of tetrahydrofuran and toluene THF tol in a respective weight ratio of 65 35 was prepared by stirring the interpolymer in the solvent mixture for 30 minutes at 300C. Crystallization of a coating prepared from the solution was monitored by casting a film from the solution onto a 12.7 micrometer tetrafluoroethylene film directly in the beam of a recording infrared spectrophotometer using a coating apparatus generally identical to that described in U.S. Patent 3,220,378. The spectrophotometer was a Beckman Model 4240 commerically available from Beckman Instruments, Inc. The coated film was maintained at a temperature of about 800C throughout the procedure described herein.An infrared absorption band of 1045 cm is characteristic of crystalline vinylidene chloride interpolymers. Intensity of the 1045 cm 1 absorption band was monitored with time to yield a crystallization rate curve and a value for change in optical density at 1045 cm 1 The change in optical density at 1045 cm 1 as a result of crystallization is divided by a correction factor. The correction factor is the difference between an optical density value for the coated film at 1410 cm 1 and an optical density value for the coated film at 1520 cm 1 The correction factor is an approximate correction factor for coating thickness.Data reported in Tables I andII was thus determined in accordance with the following formula Optical density at 1045 cm 1 at 15 minutes Optical density atCrystallization ratio 1045 cm l at 0 minutes at 15 minutes at 800C Optical density at 1410 cm 1 Optical density at 1520 cm 1 6. Measuring relative viscosity of the interpo lymer Relative viscosity of the interpolymer was determined by using an Oswald viscosimeter. A one percent interpolymer solution was prepared by dissolving about 1 2 gram of the interpolymer in 50 milliliters of tetrahydrofuran.The one percent solution was compared to a pure sample of tetrahydrofuran in a manner wellknown in the art to determine a relative viscosity. The following Table I sets forth the composition of the interpolymer, the relative viscosity thereof, the haze stability thereof and the minimum heat seal temperature, the WVTR, the 02TR and the crystallization ratio at 15 minutes at 800C of coatings prepared therefrom. For purposes of identification, the interpolymer prepared by the process detailed in part A of Example 1 is hereinafter identified asExperiment A. Two additional interpolymers were prepared and tested in generally the same manner asExperiment A. These interpolymers are identified inTable I as Experiments B and C.
