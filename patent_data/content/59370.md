# Automatic lock slider for slide fasteners.

## Abstract
An automatically locking slider 10 for slide fasteners has a locking member 25 including a piece of resilient strip which is bent into a generally 3 shape having a U shaped base 26 extending around a transverse spindle of a pull tab 17 , a locking prong 29 extending from one end of the base 26 , and an anchor 27 extending from the other end of the base 26 and terminating in a recessed end 28 interlocked with a locking member retaining nose 23 on a slider s neck 13 . The base 26 is normally urged against the spindle of the pull tab 17 by the resilience of the strip 25 . The recessed end 28 of the anchor 27 is normally urged against the nose 23 by the resilience of the strip 25 and is thereby prevented from becoming out of interlocking en gagement with the nose 23 . Thus the locking member 25 is held in position on a slider body solely by the resilience of the strip, requiring no bending or deformation of any part of the slider body that would make the slider defective from an aesthetic view.
