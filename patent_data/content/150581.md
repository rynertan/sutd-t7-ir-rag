# Apparatus for charging, and transporting toner particles.

## Abstract
This invention is generally directed to an apparatus for charging toner particles comprised in operative relationship of a means for charging insulating toner particles 12 and a means for transporting 1 insulating toner particles, said means for charging 12 and said means for transporting 1 being charged to a predetermined potential, which apparatus further includes therein a brush device 21 for delivering toner particles to a charging nip 11 situated between the means for charging the toner particles 12 and the means for transport ing the toner particles 1 . The brush device 21 can also func tion as a charging source for the toner particles, and as a cleaning system. More specifically in one embodiment the present invention is directed to an apparatus for simultane ously metering, charging and transporting non magnetic insu lating toner particles comprising in operative relationship a me tering roll means 12 , an optional trim blade means 27 for said metering roll means, a toner supply reservoir means 25 containing therein weakly charged insulating toner particles possessing about an equal number of positive and negative charges thereon, a transporting hard roll 1 or donor belt means 2 , a triboelectrically active coating contained on said transporting means, a drive roll means 4 , an idler means 10 , a tensioning means 14 , an imaging means, a voltage source means 15 for the metering roll means, a voltage source means 6 for the drive roll means 4 , and the transporting means, said metering roll means 12 moving in a direction op posite to the direction of movement of the transporting means 1 and wherein the apparatus further includes a moving brush means 21 contained in the toner supply reservoir 25 which brush means contains bristles 23 thereon, wherein the brush 21 transports toner particles to a charging nip 11 situated between the metering roll means 12 and the transporting means 1 .
