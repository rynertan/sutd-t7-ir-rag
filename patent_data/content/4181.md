# Shaft coupling.

## Abstract
A coupling 8 for a flexible shaft 10 for a pump rotor 12 orbiting within a stator 13 . Coupling of the shaft 10 to a driving or driven member is made easily by screwing the end 10.1 of the shaft 10 by hand into a socket 12.1 in the member 12 , and by then locking the shaft 10 against rotation in the socket 12.1 by means of abutting complementary oblique faces 18.1 10.12 at the end of the shaft 10 and at the end of the locking element 18 in the transverse bore 16 intersecting the socket 12.1 . The screwing in of the shaft 10 into the socket 12.1 need not to be more than fingertight.
