# A process of preparing platinum complexes.

## Abstract
A process is provided for preparing cis Pt NH₃ ₂Cl₂ and intermediates. As a step in the process, the intermediate cis Pt NH₃ ₂l₂ is prepared from K₂Ptl₄ or Na₂Ptl₄ by adding NH₄OH under controlled conditions of temperature and pH. The cis Pt NH₃ ₂Cl₂ is provided in high yield and purity.
