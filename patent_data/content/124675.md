# Device to be fixed to the step of the dagger board of a surf board to serve as a padler s seat.

## Abstract
Device consisting of a seat 1 and a rudder bar 3 applied to the body of a wind surfer by means of a blocking clamp 6 through the step 7 of the dagger board to allow alternating propulsion of the craft with paddles or the like.

## Claims
Claims 1. Device to be fixed to the step of the dagger board of a wired surfer for a paddler to sit on, consisting of a seat with a rudder bar for a paddler to sit on, joined to the body of the craft by being fixed through the step or the dagger board. 2. Device as claimed in claim 1.wherein the anatomical seat 1 for the paddler P to sit on is joined to ongitudinal bar 2 on which is placed rudder bar 3, the position of which can be adjusted by inserting pn 4 in suitable holes 5 made in said bar 2, which in fixed to the body of the wind surfer S by means of element 6 held agaist the lower opening of the step 7 of the dagger board, attached with screws, grooves or any other way to the top end of rod 8 in correspondence with said bar 2, while the second point of attachment is realized with element 9, preferably of the expansion type, inserted in the hole 30 normally used for the bottom of the mast. 3. Device as claimed in claim j wherein anatomically shaped bar ii is applied to the paddler s legs P, by means of adjusting belt 12, or the like, attached to bar 2 in order to prevent the natural bending of the legs, which can lead to loss of equilibrium during motion

## Description
Device to be fixed to the step of the dagger board of a surf board to serve as a paddler s seatStefano PALAZZI, Maurizio PALAZZIThe invention concerns a device to be applied to surf boards in order to transform them from wind surfers into crafts powered by paddles or the like.It is known that wind surfers are usually paced in the water only under favorabZeewind conditions, except for experts. They thus are not used for long periods.The aim of the invention is to allow a wider, more differentiated use of wind surfers, by removing the most and said and transforming them into crafts like canoes.This aim is achieved wihh the device according to the invention, consisting of a seat with a rudder bar for a paddler to sit on, joined to the body of the craft By being fixed through the step of the dagger board which, being an open aperture, allows it to be held against the lower surface of the wind surfer.The invention is shown in a preferred embodiment in the attached drawing, in which figure 1 shows an axoncmetric exploded view of the device figure 2 shows the device attached to a wind surfer. The figures show in detail the anatomic seat 1 for the paddlerP, joined to longitudinal bar 2 on which is placed rudder bar 3, the position of which can be adjusted by inserting pin 4 in suitable holes 5 made in said bar 2, which is fised to the body of the wind surfer S by means of element 6 held against the lower opening of the step 7 of the dagger board, attached with screws, grooves or any zither way to the top end of rod 8 in correspondence with said bar 2, while the second point of attachment is realized with element 9, preferably of the expansion type, inserted in the hole 20 normally used for the bottom of the mast. Another characteristic of the invention consist of the presence of anatomically shaped bar ii to be applied to the paddlerls legs P, by means of adjusting belt 12, or the like, attached to bar 2, inrorder to prevent the natural bending of the legs, which can lead to loss of equilibrium during motion.Obviously, assembling the device according to the invention involves only application and fixing of the blocking element 7 in step 8, and insertion of expansion element 10 in the opening 11 of the wind surfer S.Of course, while the principle of the finding remains unchanged, the forms of realization and the details of construction may be varied widely from that described and illustrated here, without going beyond the bounds of the present invention.
