# A CONTROL CIRCUIT FOR WIPER ACTUATION FOR A VEHICLE WINDOW

## Abstract
A control circuit for a motor driven wiper on a vehicle window comprises a voltage oscillator 30 32 effective to generate a rectangular voltage wave having a substantially constant frequency and duty cycle the circuit producing two additional rectangular voltage waves from the first a second delayed from the first by a first delay circuit 43 47 and a third delayed from the first by a second delay circuit 36 41 dependent upon the capacitance of a capacitive sensing element 15 affected by moisture on the vehicle window. The three rectangular voltage waves are provided to the inputs of an AND gate 34 having an output effective to trigger and retriggerable monostable multivibrator 50 having an energized output period longer in duration than a cycle of the rectangular voltage wave to drive the wiper motor when the level of moisture on the window in the vicinity of the capacitor is sufficiently high. The first delay circuit may be adjustable by the vehicle operator to vary the moisture sensitivity of the system. If the capacitive sensing element is placed within the wipe pattern just above the inner wipe position, a fully automatic control may be provided.
