## Description
DESCRIPTION SUPPORT STAKE FOR PLANTS AND METHOD OF FABRICATING THE STAKE This invention is directed to a support stake for plants and a method of manufacturing the same. More particularly it relates to an extruded stake made of metal or synthetic plastics material. Many previous attempts have been made to provide practical stakes for use in supporting soft stemmed plants. Widespread use is still made of wooden stakes for use with plants such as tomatoes, flowers and the like.However, wood is expensive, bulky and can break and inflicts splinters or slivers on the unwary user.Metal is practical to an extent but it is a high cost heavy item, subject to rust, and expensive to transport in bulk. However there may be situations in which metal stakes are desirable or even essential. Other speciality stakes, such as that shown inU.S. Patent Specification No.4,176,494 have been proposed, but being of relatively complex arrangement they are unsuited for low cost extruded production, and may furthermore be over complicated by stem clips and the like. Canadian Patent Specification No.279,684 shows a metal stake of U section having a complex adjustable securing ring for attachment of a plant to the stake and U.S. Patent Specification No.3,875,699 shows a plastics post having a hollow section with extending flanges for use as a grape stake, being notched to receive wire clips. According to the present invention there is therefore provided an extruded support stake for plants having a plurality of wing portions, at least one longitudinally extending surface being inwardly curved to connect said wing portions for receiving in use a portion of a plant in braced relation therein. In its preferred form, the stake is a lightweight stake having a lobed cross section possessed of a high stiffness, at least some of the lobes having serrated edges to promote the non slippage of ties by means of which portions of plants are tied to the stake, the provision of multiple lobes serving to facilitate the attachment of more than one plant if desired, and promoting packaging and transportation by semi nesting together of multiples of stakes into bundles. the above mentioned wing portions may be constituted by a plurality of extending wing portions possessing a high stiffness modulus. In addition, the edges of the stake wing portions are preferably serrated, to facilitate the tying of ties in substa ntially non slipping relation with the stake. The provision of a cap at one end of the stake facilitates driving of the stake into the ground, the other end of the stake being parted by way of an oblique cut, to simplify fabrication and point the stakes, two at a time, in point to point relation to facilitate utilization. The stake may be formed from an extrudable metal, such as aluminium, but is preferably made from a synthetic plastics material. The form of the stake indicated above provides the following characteristics 1 Low weight to stiffness ratio. 2 Low cross sectional area which facilitates driving the stake into the ground 3 Cross sectional form adapted to production by extrusion 4 Tying serrations which are readily applied during the extrusion process and which also break the sharp edge portions and facilitate handling. 5 Outwardly concave lobed surfaces tend to provide directionalized soil compaction to minimise loosening effect in the ground, with a diminished need for ground penetration. 6 Lobed surface provides stem localization, with indirect tie forces to minimise stem damage. The stake of the present invention, particularly when extruded from a synthetic plastics material, provides a durable, clean, low cost, washable stake which is readily stored and transported. Colour may be added, at the preference of the user, using a stable plastics material such as a bottle compound.Owing to the vulnerability of PVC to ultraviolet degradation, the use of reclaimed scrap is contemplated. There. is further provided a method of manufacturing a stake by the extrusion of a lobed section, including serrating the edges of the section. Thus, according to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of fabricating a support stake for plants including the steps of extruding a multi lobed section, and forming serrated indentations into edge portions of said lobes subsequent to extrusion. The method may involve the extrusion of a thermogetting plastics material to form the multi lobed section, and the indentations may be formed by rolling, cutting or turning. The invention will now be further described, merely by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is a general view showing a portion of a stake in accordance with the present invention Figure 2 is a schematic plan section showing a plant stem in tied relation with the stake of Figure i Figure 3 is a scrap view showing a serrated lobe edge of the stake of Figure 1 Figures 4, 5 and 6 show horizontal cross sections through alternative embodiments and Figure 7 shows a stake, according to the present invention, complete with end cap and diagonal point, in ground inserted relation. Referring to the drawings, Figure 1 shows a 3 lobed extruded plastics support stake 10 for plants which has lobes 12 having serrated edge portions 14 Figure 3 , generally applied as a coining operation, by rolling, immediately subsequent to the extrusion operation. The relative size of the serrations are somewhat exaggerated for the purposes of illustration and appreciation. The lobes 12 thus constitute wing portions such that the stake has three longitudinally extending surfaces.ll Figure 2 which are inwardly curved to inter connect the lobes 12 for receiving in use a portion of a soft stemmed plant 13 in braced relation therein. The serrated edge portions 14 facilitate the retention of ties 17 thereabout in substantially non slipping relation, i.e. the ties will not have a tendency to slide down towards the bottom of the stake and hence not serve their intended purpose. Figure 7 illustrates a stake 15, corresponding to the stake 10 of Figure 1, having a cylindrical end cap or driving cap 16 and a pointed or tapered end 18 obtained by an oblique severance cut such that, during the manufacturing process, stakes are separated in pairs and simultaneously pointed. The driving cap 16 extends closely over at least a plurality, and preferably all, of the lobes 12.The tapered end 18 facilitates insertion of the stake into the ground. Figures 4 and 6 illustrate cross sections through alternative four lobed cruciform embodiments. TheFigure 5 embodiment is contemplated as a more expensive specialty stake of limited application. Although the particular description and drawings relate to stakes extruded from synthetic plastics materials, it is envisaged that suitable metals may be used for certain specialised applications.
