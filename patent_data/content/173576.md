# CABLE ENCAPSULATION AND STRAIN RELIEF

## Abstract
Cable splice and encapsulation arrangement to cover an encapsulated cable region which is devoid of sheath and jacket. At each side of the devoid region 22, 76 , the cable 18, 19, 70 has a strap member 10 encircling it and piercing means 16 of the strap member protrude through the jack et 46 and into the sheath 34, 36 at spaced positions around the cable. An outwardly projecting means 14 of each strap member is intimately embedded in a moulded plastic end 50, 86 of a combined encapsulation and tensile strength means 48, 84 . This combined means may be an integral plastic molding 48 having the two ends 50 and a por tion 52 between the ends and which bridges the devoid region 22 . Alternatively, it may comprise individual mould ed plastic ends 86 with tensile means such as steel rods 92 extending between and embedded in the ends. The invention also includes a strain relief device for inclusion in the splice and encapsulation arrangement.
