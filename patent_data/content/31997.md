# Polymerisation process for production of polymer microparticles of high refractive index and coating compositions containing them.

## Abstract
The production is described of polymer microparticles, which may optionally be crosslinked, by dispersion polymer isation in aliphatic hydrocarbon liquid of a monomer mixture which comprises up to 50 of styrene or a substituted deriva tive thereof and up to 50 by weight of a derivative of maleic acid or fumaric acid which is soluble in the hydrocarbon liquid at the polymerisation temperature. The microparticles have a high refractive index and are suitable for incorporation in coating compositions which are based on a film forming polymer, such as a thermosetting acrylic resin or an resin, containing a significant proportion of aromatic residues, and which are intended to be used either unpig mented or when containing only light absorbing pigments.
