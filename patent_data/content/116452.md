## Description
The present invention relates to an improved synthesis of nizatidine, an important and relatively new H₂ receptor antagonist, primarily of use in the treatment of gastric ulcers, and to a novel intermediate useful in that synthesis. Nizatidine, i.e., N methyl N 2 2 dimethylaminomethylthiazol 4 ylmethylthio ethyl 2 nitro 1,1 ethenediamine, has the structural formula I and is described in U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,382,090. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for preparing nizatidine which comprises reacting the isothiourea of formula I with nitromethane, at a temperature of from 50 C to 150 C. The invention also provides a process for preparing the novel intermediate of formula I which comprises reacting the methylthioethylamine of the formula with methylcarbonimidodithioic acid, dimethyl ester, of the formula The novel intermediate of formula I is provided in a third aspect of the invention. In this document, all temperatures are described in degrees Celsius. As stated above, the intermediate of formula I can be used to prepare nizatidine by reacting it with nitromethane. The reaction is preferably carried out in a secondary alkanol such as 2 butanol or isopropanol. Other solvents which can be used, but which provide lesser yields, include nitriles such as acetonitrile and propionitrile esters such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate and the like, and primary alkanols such as ethanol and isobutanol. It is possible to carry out the reaction with nitromethane without any additional solvent, but it is preferable to use some solvent. It has been found most advantageous to use about equal weights of solvent and nitromethane, and to use a substantial excess of nitromethane, such as at least about 5 moles per mole of the isothiourea. Extremely large excesses in the range of from about 10 to about 25 moles of nitromethane, or even more, may be used if desired and will cause no difficulty. It is desirable to carry out the nitromethane reaction at an elevated temperature, in the range of about 50 150 , and about 100 has been found to be especially convenient. The reaction is not particularly rapid, even at elevated temperature, and several hours reaction time is necessary. Periods of about 12 24 hours are convenient. It will be understood that higher temperatures will usually allow the process to proceed at a higher rate, and that the process may be carried out under pressure, if desired, to enable higher temperatures to be used. The starting compounds which can be used to prepare the intermediate of formula I are known compounds. The thiazole is disclosed in British Patent Specification No. 2,067,987, and the dithioic acid ester is disclosed by Ainley The preparation of the intermediate is preferably carried out in water, an alkanol such as ethanol or isopropanol, or an aqueous alkanol. Higher molecular weight alcohols such as 2 butanol can be used but give less yield and a less pure product. Solvents other than alkanols, such as esters, halogenated alkanes, ethers, and aromatics can be used if necessary but are by no means preferred. The reaction is carried out in the presence of at least about 1 mole of an acid. Both mineral acids and organic acids are useful, and the acid may be added as such or as an acid addition salt of either reactant. The examples below show various acids in use, including very strong acids such as hydrochloric acid and methanesulfonic acid, as well as relatively weak acids such as oxalic acid. Any practical organic or inorganic acid may be used as is convenient in the circumstances, such as acetic acid, butyric acid, benzoic acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, maleic acid and the like. When an aqueous or aqueous alkanolic reaction medium is used, it is highly preferred to adjust its pH to about 5 7. Both product purity and yields are improved by doing so. Depending on the nature of the acid used in the mixture, it may be necessary to add some base to obtain the desired pH. The identity of the base is not important, so long as the solubilities of the substances are taken into account. Bases such as potassium, lithium and sodium hydroxides, carbonates and bicarbonates, tertiary amines including pyridine, triethylamine and triethanolamine, and the like may be used as is convenient in the circumstances. The acid base balance is less important when a nonaqueous reaction mixture is used. Operation in water as the reaction solvent is preferred. The examples below show the use of both aqueous reaction mixtures and mixtures based on alcohols, as well as the use of both dilute aqueous acid and relatively concentrated acids. The reaction takes place at moderately elevated temperatures in reasonable periods of time. Temperatures in the range of from about 50 to about 125 are convenient. It is particularly convenient, as usual in organic chemistry, to operate at the ambient pressure reflux temperature of the reaction mixture, but there is no objection to operating under pressure in order to raise the boiling point of the mixture. Particularly advantageous temperatures are in the range of about 75 100 . Reaction times in the range of from a few hours to 1 day are appropriate the examples below show excellent yields of product obtained in times in the range of about 3 8 hours. A chemist would expect that the starting compounds used in the present process would possess an unpleasant odor, and such is indeed the case. The intermediates should be handled and the process should be carried out in equipment which is substantially vapor tight to avoid contaminating the process area with evil smelling vapors, and the process wastes must be disposed of in a suitable manner. The product of the process is conveniently isolated in good purity by conventional means as shown by the examples below. For example, the mixture may be neutralized and extracted with an organic solvent, and the product isolated from the aqueous layer by making it highly basic and extracting with a suitable organic solvent, especially dichloromethane.
