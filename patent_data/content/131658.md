# A synchronisation mechanism for a multiprocessing system.

## Abstract
A synchronisation mechanism is disclosed for controlling devices or sub systems connected to a common bus in a multiprocessing system so that the devices are kept in step one with the other when performing sequences of operations. More specifically, the mechanism ensures that no device can start its i 1 th operation until all devices have completed their ith operation. This is achieved by providing each device with three synchronising logic blocks LB1, LB2, LB3 each of which functions to generate control signals p, q, r respec tively on associated control lines at the end of selected opera tions in the sequence of operations. The control lines monitor ing the performance of corresponding operations in all the devices are each applied via logic circuits L1 or L2 or L3 as appropriate to one of three selected bus lines P, Q, R respec tively . The logic circuits operate to produce a bus control signal on the selected bus line only when all of the correspon ding operations have been completed by all the devices. As soon as a bus control signal is generated on one of the bus lines all devices start performing the next operation in the respective sequences.
