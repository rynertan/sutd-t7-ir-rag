# PACKAGE FOR DISPENSING MEDICATION

## Abstract
A package for medication comprises a blister pack 10 in the form of a single blister sheet defining a plurality of pockets 11 filled with the medication and covered with a rear foil layer 30 . In addition the blister pack 10 can be covered with an outside relatively permanent plastics cover 20, 21 including means for hanging the cover on suitable supports. The pockets 11 of the blister sheets are arranged in five columns of seven rows with four of the columns having elongate axes 13, 14, 15, 16 of the pockets inclined to the left and the final column having the axes 17 inclined to the right. This provides a readi ly visible indication that the user has reached the final column thus requiring reordering of further medications in a replaceable blister pack. A slight change in angle between the four left wardly inclined columns prevents use of counterfeit medications.
