# Process for producing permanent magnet materials.

## Abstract
Permanent magnet materials of the Fe B R type are produced by preparing a metallic powder having a mean particle size of 0.3 80 microns and a composition of 8 30 at R, 2 28 at B, and the balance Fe, compacting, and sintering, at a temperature of 900 1200 degrees C. Co up to 50 at may be present. Additional elements M Ti, Ni, Bi, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Al, Sb, Ge, Sn, Zr, Hf may be present. The process is applicable for anisotropic and iso tropic magnet materials.
