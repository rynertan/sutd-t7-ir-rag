# Process for forming alloy layer.

## Abstract
A method of forming an alloy layer on the surface of a substrate 28 comprising forming a vessel 10 a molten bath 20 comprising at least one vaporizable alloying component having a higher vapor pressure than at least one other vaporizable alloying component in said bath, forming a thin, substantially inert, liquid layer of an evaporation retarding film on the upper surface of said molten bath, said liquid layer of an evaporation retarding film having a lower or comparable vapor pressure than both said vaporizable alloying components, co vaporizing at least a portion of both said vaporizable alloying components whereby said evapor ation retarding film retards the initial evaporation of said vaporizable alloying component having a higher vapor pressure, and forming an alloy layer comprising both said vaporizable alloying components on said substrate.
