## Description
The present invention relates to co vulcanizable compositions of fluoroelastomers. More particularly,the present invention relates to co vulcanizable compositions of fluoroelastomers, having improved chemical stability. The fluoroelastomers on the basis of vinylidene fluoride, vulcanized according to the bisphenolic or dihydroxy systems Kirk Othmer, Encyclopaedia of Chemical Technology, vol. 8, page 506, 1979 , are very valuable products which are used in the industrial world, in particular in the fields of car and oil industry, and in general in the energy industrial field. In the automobile field, fluoroelastomers are used mainly in the fuel circulation system or as components of engine parts and of parts of gearbox differential trans mission unit. In the first case, as application examples, mem branes for fuel pumps, valve seats, non return valves, flexible hoses and, in general, seal gaskets for fuel can be mentioned. In the second case, analogous examples are gaskets for gear wheels, seal liners for cylinders in diesel engines, gaskets for the crankshaft, non return valves for the exhaust gases, gaskets of the type of shaft seals, and still others. In the oil and energy industrial field, fluoroelas tomers are used for applications wherein they come into direct contact with the crude oil, above all at high temperatures and pressures , such as, for example, for gaskets, valves and pumps, or parts thereof. In this field, an important application for fluoro elastomers is represented by the expansion joints used in the exhaust ducts for the flue gases in thermoelectric power plants, wherein resistance to high temperatures combined with resistance to the corrosive action of acid ic flue gases is required. Fluoroelastomers are used in these , and in other fields, such as in the electric and electronic field, thanks to their properties of high thermal stability and chemical resistance, even at high temperatures. But during the last years, and in some application types, precise technological requirements have arisen, which the manufactures of the prior art, vulcanized by the bisphenolic or dihydroxy systems, are not able to fulfil. The problem involves in particular the chemical stability under severe operating conditions characterized by high temperatures in the presence of steam, of mineral acids, of highly aggressive lubricating fluids, such as, e.g., the oils of SF series, containing as additives compounds having a high swelling capacity for fluoroelas tomers based on vinylidene fluoride. Furthermore, a general improvement is required as regards the processability characteristics of the mixes, for the moulding of such articles as the shaft seals, as well as the possibility to easily extrude the mixes to produce suitable semifinished articles having even com plex profiles. The problem of the chemical stability has been solved thanks to the use of the peroxidic vulcanization process. However, this type of vulcanization does not fulfil the above mentioned requirements as for processability, in particular by moulding and extrusion furthermore, the same processability results to be less reliable Rubber Chemistry and Technology, vol. 55, page 906, 1982 , and on compression set test much poorer results are obtained Kirk Othmer, ibid., page 510 . In European patent application No. 84.110707, co vulcanized compositions have been prepared and disclosed, which have allowed certain improvements in performance to be achieved, but which still show poor processing relia bility, as well as a slight decrease of chemical thermal properties. Purpose of the present invention is to provide a co vulcanizable composition of fluoroelastomers, which al lows the above described drawbacks to be overcome. More particularly, purpose of the present invention is to provide a co vulcanizable composition of fluoroe lastomers based on vinylidene fluoride, which allows an improved processing reliability and a better chemical and thermal stability to be achieved. The Applicant has now surprisingly found, and is the object of the present invention, that these and further purposes are achieved by means of a co vulcanizable elas tomeric composition comprising The elastomers as of item A are known from tech nical literature and can be prepared as described in Kirk Othmer, ibid., pages 500 foll., or they can be found on the market under the tradenames VITON, TECNOFLON, FLUOREL, DAIEL.

Other peroxidic cross linking coagents are, e.g., triallylisocyanurate and tetramethyl tetravinyl cyclotetrasiloxane. Examples of organic peroxides which can be used in the compositions of the present invention comprise 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di tert.butylperoxyhexane and the corres ponding derivative of hexine.
