# A process for expanding microspheres.

## Abstract
A process for expanding expandable thermoplastic micro spheres containing a blowing agent which will be volatilized at heating. A slurry of the unexpanded spheres is fed to a pres sure zone together with steam whereby volatilization of the blowing agent occurs in the zone and the expanded micro spheres are then allowed to leave the zone at a considerable pressure drop.
