# Hog feeder.

## Abstract
Feeder apparatus is provided for delivering a predetermined amount of feed to hogs and like live stock. The apparatus includes a feed transporting and dispensing conveyor 26 with which are associated a plurality of feeder units 25 each unit receives and temporarily stores the feed. Each unit includes a feed receiver body 31 . A boot 34 extends from the body 31 and defines a discharge opening 44 . A pear shaped stopper valve 40 carried in the boot fits into and onto the discharge opening to obstruct the flow. A stopper valve pull system 47 acts to draw the stopper valve away from the discharge opening, thereby permitting feed flow if desired, this pull system can be connected to a timer so as to discharge the feed at a pre selected moment. The stopper valve includes a semi spheroidal element 41 adapted to fit into and onto the discharge opening and a conical element 42 adapted to be drawn through the feed pile so as to discourage feed bridging and hang up within the feeder unit body. A discharge tube extending into the feeder unit body includes an extensible and retractable bellows member 52 for varying the height of the feed pile to be collected within the feeder unit.
