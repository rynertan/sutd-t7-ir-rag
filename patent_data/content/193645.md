# Naphthalenic derivatized plasticizers for polyphosphazene polymers.

## Abstract
Plasticized polyphosphazene compositions exhibiting excellent flame resistance and low smoke output are dis closed. The plasticizers are resinous alkylated naphtha lenes condensed with formaldehyde which are charac terized by methylene bridges between naphthalenic rings with softening points ranging from 2.2 C to 70 C.
