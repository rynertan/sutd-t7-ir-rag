# Slide fastener chain.

## Abstract
A slide fastener chain 1 has a plurality of spaced separating regions along which the slide fastener chain 1 can be separated or torn to slide fastener lengths one after another by hand without a cutting device. Each separating region 7 extends transversely across the fastener chain 1 and is at least partially thinned or recessed by fusing the thermoplastic synthetic materials of the fastener stringers 2,2 at the prospective sepa rating region 7 .
