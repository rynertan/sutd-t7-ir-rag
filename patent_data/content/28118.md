# Polymer articles containing entrapped volatile ingredients.

## Abstract
A hydrophilic monomer such as hydroxypropyl methacry late and a lipophilic monomer such as lauryl methacrylate are copolymerised in the presence of a fragrance or other volatile active ingredient. The resulting polymer contains entrapped active ingredient which tends not to exude from the polymer during storage yet is gradually released as vapour when the po lymer is exposed to the atmosphere. e.g. as an air freshener.
