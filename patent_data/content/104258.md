## Description
CHROMATOGRAPHY STICK AND SAMPLE DEVELOPING METHODTechnical Field This invention relates to chromatography stick which is utilized in a chromatography technique wherein silica gel is used in separating and collecting a sample including two or more components to develop and separate respective components, and is good in separating characteristics and is large in collected amounts and, also, relates to a sample developing method utilizing the stick.Background Art Recently, a sample developing method has been utilized wherein silica gel is thinly applied on a glass plate, and is dried to form a thin layer of silica gel, then, one or two drops of a sample is attached on one end of the layer, and the layer is dipped in a solvent such as benzene or kerosine, thereby developing the sample and separating and collecting components of the sample by utilizing respective rising up rates of the components. According to prior art wherein the thin layer of silica gel A is formed on a glass plate B, there are shortcomings such that since the portion adjacent to the glass plate is highly dried in the manufacturing process the rate of adsorption differ between the portion adjacent to the glass plate and the outer portion remote from the glass plate, thus, the developing condition on the silica gel is not uniform refer to Fig. 1 . Further, when the silica gel is thickly coated, there is a tendency that samples are mixed in cutting the silica gel to collect samples. As the result, it is not possible to coat thickly the silica gel, thus, a large amount of the sample cannot be developed and the collected amounts of samples cannot be increased. Further, since the sample develops at an inclined form the separation necessitates a large distance, thus, the silica gel cannot usually be used two times or more. The present invention aims to provide a chromatography member which enables to develop the sample at a short distance, whereby it is possible to use the member for several times since a substantial length of non used portion is left when a sample developed portion is cut off. Further, the invention aims to provide a chromatography member which enables to develop the sample uniformly and in parallel and to prevent the mixing of components of the sample. Further, the development of the sample is easy and a large amount of the sample can be collected. Further, the invention aims to provide a sample developing method which enables to develop the sample by simply mounting a stick on a mounting stand, thus the method is very simple and extremely practical.Disclosure of the Invention Accordingly, the chromatography member according to the invention is formed solely of adsorptive material such as silica gel or the like and, if necessary, mixed with a binder such as plaster or the like and is formed to have a column like or platelike configuration. Whereby, the development of the sample is uniform and in parallel, the mixing of components of the sample is prevented, and the length of sample developed portion is short thereby permitting the usage over several times. Further, according to the invention, the sample is attached on the bottom surface of heretofore described chromatography member, and the member is mounted on a mounting stand to which a solvent is freely supplied. Whereby, a large amount of components of the sample can easily be collected by simply mounting the chromatography member on a mounting stand.Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 is a schematic explanatory view of prior art method Fig. 2 is a side view showing the essential portion ofFig. 1 Fig. 3 is a longitudinal sectional view of an embodiment of the invention Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 are front views of other embodiments of the invention and Fig. 6 is a perspective view of a stick of the invention showing a sample developed condition.Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention The invention will hereinafter be explained in detail with respect to embodiments shown in the drawings, wherein shown at 1 is a stick formed of an adsorptive material such as silica gel, alumina, cellulose, polyamide and the like, and mixed with a required binder material such as plaster to form a desired configuration such as a column like or plate like shape. Such column like or plate like shaped member is defined as stick.The materials are dissolved in water and are formed to have a desired configuration and, thereafter, dried at about 1100C to strengthen the adsorptive power in forming the stick 1. Shown at 2 is a container for receiving therein solvent 3 such as kerosene or benzene, and a mounting stand 4 is mounted therein.The mounting stand 4 is formed of a box like member 5 having a suitable number of through holes 6, 6, ... in the circumference thereof and in a same plane. Shown at 7 is a liquid rising up member formed of material such as sponge, guaze, asbestos, glass and the like having the capillarity function and received in the box like member 5 with the upper surface thereof being positioned above the through holes 6, 6, ... in the box like member. The solvent 3 enters into the box like member 5 through the holes 6, 6, ... so that the liquid rising up member contains the solvent 3 as a whole. Next, description will be made with respect to the usage. A sample 8 is attached on the bottom surface of the stick 1 and the stick 1 is mounted on the liquid rising up member 7. When the cross section of the stick 1 is a stable form such as rectangular or circular the stick itself is positioned upright and, when the cross section is an instable form such as plate or the like the stick is leaned on 9 side wall of the container 2 with the height of which being increased or is leaned on other supporting member so as to retain the stick as upright as possible. The solvent 3 soaks into the stick 1 from the bottom surface thereof and the sample 8 attached to the bottom surface is developed. If the solvent 3 is positioned upwards of the portion to which the sample 8 is attached, the solvent moves upward without developing the sample. The sample 8 is developed to form separated layers 9, 9, ... due to the difference in the adsorption of respective components with respect to the stick 1.When the separation has sufficiently been made, the stick 1 is cut by respective separated layers 9, 9 ... and the samples of respective components are obtained. The sample is used for qualitative or quantitative analysis as desired through steps such as solvent extracting step and the like. The mounting stand 4 may be constituted of, without utilizing the box like member 5, a stand portion 10 and a leg portion 11, and the liquid rising up member 7 is mounted on the stand portion 10, which is formed of such as a plate member, an L shaped mesh member or a perforated plate, with the lower end or downwardly depending portion of the liquid rising up member 7 being dipped in the solvent 3 so as to wet the liquid rising up member 7. Further, the liquid rising up member may be omitted with the solvent 3 being received in the container 3 at a level same to the stand portion 10 of the mounting stand 4. According to the method of the invention as heretofore described, a mounting stand is positioned in a container receiving therein solvent, the sample is attached to the bottom surface of a chromatography stick which is formed of silica gel and, if necessary, mixed with a binder such as plaster and is formed to have plate like or column like configuration, and the chromatography stick is mounted on the mounting stand to which the solvent is supplied, thus, it is possible to increase the crosssectional area of the stick, and to increase the amount of the sample being adsorbed thereby obtaining large amount of the sample components. Further, there is no obstruction against the development of the sample, and, it is possible to obtain accurate sample components since the separation characteristic are very good.Capability of Exploitation in Industry As heretofore described, the chromatography stick and the sample develping method according to the invention, the difference in adsorptive characteristics of the sample are not observed, the sample is accurately separated into respective components, the separation and development of the sample are reliable and accurate without having the risk of mixing. Further, the portion on which the sample is developed is cut and the sample is collected, but the development is performed on a short distance when the separation is properly made, thus, the stick can be used over several times. Further, the stick can be formed into a thick and large form without causing any trouble, thus, it is possible to collect large amount of the sample or the components of the sample, whereby analysis can easily and accurately be performed.
