# Motor vehicle lamp reflector.

## Abstract
The rectangular reflector has lateral reflective portions 23, 24 and instead of having upper and lower planar fill in portions which can result in undesirable reflections, has upper and lower reflective portions 25, 26 which are consti tuted by an infinite number of non circular, e.g. parabolic or elliptical, curves. These curves extend forwardly of the reflec tor body 20 to terminate at the front opening 21 thereof. The curves have foci and focal axes which are coincident and increase progressively in focal length from the centre of the reflector to the lateral reflective portions 23, 24 . Such a reflector has improved light collection and light spreading properties.
