# Improvements in holography.

## Abstract
A method of producing a holograph of a large object, for example, a building, in which a photographic transparency of the building is taken and laser light passed through the trans parency to irradiate a 3 dimensional scale model of the build ing, the holograph being produced either by reflection or transmission.
