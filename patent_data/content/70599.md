## Description
DEVICE FOR HOOKING AND UNHOOKING KEYS CARRIED BY AKEY HOLDER This invention relates to a device for hooking and unhooking keys carried by a key holder. One type of presently available key holder comprises as its key support element a rigid ring, of which a portion is open and which rotates in a slot provided in the key holder body. On the outside of the body there is provided a slidable button which is rigid with a tooth. By sliding the button with a finger, the tooth either becomes inserted into or withdraws from the slot. Thus when the open portion of the ring is located in the slot, the button is pushed in such a direction that the tooth enters the open portion, so preventing further rotation of the ring. By pressing the button in the opposite direction, the tooth leaves the slot and returns to its seat, so enabling the ring to rotate in order to move its open portion to the outside for adding or replacing keys. The invention proposes to simplify this design by replacing the tooth and button with a resilient element which spontaneously engages in the open portion, so preventing accidental rotation of the ring, but for which a manually applied force of no great strength is sufficient to oppose the action of the resilient element and allow the ring to rotate. The design proposed by the i vention is at the same time extremely simple in its construction and very functional and practical. This is because the key holder body is quite smooth without any projecting buttons to influence its configuration. Moreover, it is very difficult for the resilient element to undergo wear or damage, as however happens with known tooth and button devices. Its operation is also much simpler because the ring is rotated with one hand while the other hand simply holds the key holder, instead of it being necessary to push with the finger of one hand while holding the key holder and rotating the ring with the other. The resilient element gives definitely improved reliability and life to the device, and the keys are held in a secure manner and can be unhooked only by intentional manual action but not accidentally. These and further objects which will be more apparent hereinafter are attained according to the present invention by a device for hooking and unhooking keys carried by a key holder comprising a key holder body and a ring containing an open portion sufficiently large to enable keys to be hooked on to and unhooked from the ring, the ring rotating in a slot of circular arc configuration provided within the body and of length such as to contain in its interior a ring portion of greater length than the open ring portion, characterised in that a portion of the slot is constricted by an arcuate flat spring which presses on to the ring, and of which the curvature is such that when in its rest position it lies between the edges of the open portion in order to prevent accidental rotation of the ring, the elasticity of the spring being such as to enable it to deflect under the force exerted by the manual rotation of the ring1 thus withdrawing from the open portion. A non limiting description is given hereinafter by way of example of a preferred embodiment of the device according to the invention, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a partial view of a key holder provided with a key support ring Figures 2 and 3 are views of the interior of the key holder of Figure 1, shown in two different operating positions Figure 4 is an enlarged view of a detail of Figures 2 and 3. The drawings show only a small portion of the key holder body 10, as this can be of any configuration without it influencing the operation or characteristics of the invention in any way. A ring 11 is provided with an open portion 12 and slides in a slot 13 provided in the body 10. The cross section of the slot 13 is slightly greater than that of the ring, and has the same curvature so that the ring can slide freely inside it. The slot 13 enlarges on one side to form a cavity 14, in which two notches 16 are provided, separated from the slot 13 by walls 15. In the slots 16 are inserted the ends 17 of an arcuate spring 18 having a vertex 19 which normally intersects the slot 13 at that portion into which the cavity 14 opens, so reducing the slot cross section. Suitable spacers 20 retain thel ends 17 of the spring 18 in the notches 16, to enable them to slide axially with slight slack so that the spring can deform, but not to translate parallel to itself. The principle of operation, which is very simple, is as follows. When in the position shown in Figure 1 and by the full lines in Figure 4, the open portion 12 of the ring 11 contains in its interior the vertex 19 of the spring 18, which prevents rotation of the ring because any small rotational movements of the ring in one direction or the other cause the edges of the open portion 12 to make contact with the spring. However, on manually rotating the ring in one direction or the other, an edge of the open portion 12 presses against the spring 18 so as to deform it elastically, as shown by dashed lines in Figure 4, thus flattening it. when the outer circumference of the ring 11 is tangential to the spring vertex 19 Figure 3 and dashed lines in Figure 4 , the ring is able to rotate without hindrance, although not idly because the vertex 19 continually presses against the ring, thus requiring continuous manual force to rotate it. Under these conditions, as the load is uniform and is exerted on the vertex 19, the spring extends as it deforms, so that the ends 17 slide in the respective notches 16 as again illustrated by dashed lines in Figure 4. When the open portion 12 is external to the body, as shown in Figure 3, it is possible to hook or unhook keys on to or from the ring. If the ring is again rotated so that the open portion 12 enters the body, the ring releases its pressure on the spring 18 Figure 2 , and this resiliently returns into the position in which it partly occupies the open portion 12, so preventing accidental rotation of the ring 11. The body 10 is advantageously formed from two half body portions, glued, screwed or otherwise fixed together in order to form between them the slot 13 and compartment 14 for containing the various members of the device.
