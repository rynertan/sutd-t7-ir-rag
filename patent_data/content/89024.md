# Mechanical starter for internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
A mechanical starter according to the present invention comprises two disc shaped elemente 1, 3 coaxial with each other and rotatable the one with respect to the other, and at least two strips 20, 21 of elastomeric material, coplanar to each other, which at their ends are fixed to the dis shaped elements. One of the two disc shaped elements is secured to the body of an internal combustion engine, while the other 3 disc shaped element rotates with respect to the first one. Means are provided for deforming the strips of elastomeric material to store thereby energy in said strips and for delivering said energy to the shaft of the engine.
