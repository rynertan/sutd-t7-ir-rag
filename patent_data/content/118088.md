# Process and apparatus for preparation of polyparaphenylene terephthalamide fibers.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of poly p phenylene terephthalamide fibers according to the wet spinning method comprising passing an optically anisotropic solution of a poly p phenylene terephthalamide type polymer through a non coagulating fluid layer and guiding the solution to a coagulating bath, characterized in that filaments are taken out together with a stream of a coagulating solution from a fine tube or a fine hole 11 arranged in the lower portion of the coagulating bath and the filaments are travelled through a space to a second fine tube or fine hole 12 arranged below said first one. In the fine tube or fine hole arranged in the lower portion of the coagulating bath, the stream of the coagulating solution flowing out together with the filaments is accelerated and in the second fine tube or fine hole, the speed of the stream of coagulating solution accompanying the filaments is decreased. In an apparatus for use in the process, a sealed chamber 10 is provided immediately below the coagulating bath 21 and integrated with the fine tube or fine hole 11 arranged in the lower portion of the coagulating bath and with the second fine tube and fine hole 12 arranged at the lower end of the chamber.
