# APPARATUS FOR THE MONITORING AND WARNING OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARDS

## Abstract
There is disclosed nortable apparatus 31, 32, 33 which is electrically operable for monitoring and for giving warning of the presence of a predetermined environmental hazard in the neighbourhood of the apparatus. The apparatus is usable in working environments e.g. shipyards, in which it is important to provide immediate detection and a warning of the presence of an environmental hazard. The apparatus therefore comprises a detector having a monitoring unit 11, 12 arranged to respond to the presence of a predetermined environmental hazard, such as the presence and or change in concentration of one or more predetermined potential environmental health hazards such as the presence of radiation e.g. X rays, poisonous gases e.g. cyanide, flamm able gases e.g. hydrocarbons, fire or smoke, or the change in concentration of specific gases, such as oxygen, where a reduced concentration can lead to suffucation and an increased concentration can lead to enhanced fire risk. The apparatus is characterised by a first indicator arrangement 13, 14 for providing a safe operation indica tion or a warning indication depending upon the detection by the monitoring unit 11, 12 respectively of the absence or the presence of the hazard and a second indicator arrangement 18 for providing a further warning indication in the event of malfunction of the apparatus sufficient to render the appar atus incapable of monitoring and giving warning of the presence of a hazard. Preferably, the apparatus is further characterised by a third indicator arrangement 17 for providing further warning indication in the event of environ mental changes occurring which could render the apparatus, or a part thereof, incapable of reliably monitoring and giving warning of the presence of a hazard.
