# Cutting machine for preparing models for spectacle lenses.

## Abstract
A cutting machine for preparing a model for spectacle lenses comprising a base rotatable about its axis by drive means for supporting a spectacle dummy lens or real lens concentrically placed thereon and serving as a model lens, a clamp rotatable with the base and the lens for holding the lens between the base and the clamp, a profiling member adapted to contact the outer periphery of the lens held between the base and the clamp, a rotary head rotatable at the same speed as the base by drive means about an axis parallel with the axis of the base for holding a model work thereon concentrically therewith, and a stationary cutter for cutting the work on the rotary head.
