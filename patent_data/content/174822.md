# Drop out correcting apparatus.

## Abstract
A drop out correcting apparatus having a drop out detecting circuit 21 for detecting a drop out period from a reproduced video signal, a mixing circuit 22 for superim posing a drop out detecting signal from the drop out detect ing circuit 21 upon the reproduced video signal, a time base fluctuation correcting circuit 23 for removing a jitter component of an output signal from the mixing circuit 22 , a drop out detecting signal separating circuit 24 for separat ing the drop out detecting signal from the output signal of the time base fluctuation correcting circuit 23 , and a drop out correcting circuit 25 for correcting the drop out of the reproduced video signal by the separated drop out detecting signal.
