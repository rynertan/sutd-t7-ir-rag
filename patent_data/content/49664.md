# Surgical stapling apparatus having self contained pneumatic system for completing manually initiated motion sequence.

## Abstract
Surgical stapling apparatus has a sequence of motion which is initiated manually and which is thereafter continued automatically by a pneumatic system contained within the apparatus. The pneumatic system uses relatively low press ure gas, and the apparatus has a mechanical linkage between the pneumatic system and the parts driven by the pneumatic system for matching the force available from the pneumatic system to the force required to drive the appar atus during the various portions of the motion sequence. An illustrative embodiment of the invention is ligating and dividing apparatus 20 in which the motion sequence includes clamping tissue 10 in the apparatus, advancing staple like metal ligatures toward the clamped tissue 10 , crimping the ligatures around the tissue 10 to ligate the tissue 10 , and cutting through the ligated tissue 10 between the ligatures.
