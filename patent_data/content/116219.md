# Chemical dispenser, particularly for a flushing toilet.

## Abstract
A chemical dispenser 10 for dispensing a predeter mined volume of a chemical solution into a body of liquid, such as water in a toilet tank 72 , in response to a change in the level of the liquid, is disclosed. The dispenser comprises a container 12 which holds the solid chemicals 26 to be dispensed, an air vent 28 extending from the top 22 of the container, and a siphon 32 which enters the container through a deck 24 located below the top of the container and has U shaped bend 36 extending above the top of the container but below the top 42 of the air vent. The dispenser structure provides substantial isolation of the chemical solution in the dispenser from the surrounding tank water between flushes, without the presence of any isolating air bubbles, and also provides a color change signal indicating when the solid chemical within the dispenser is depleted.
