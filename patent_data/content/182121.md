# Semiconductor integrated circuit with CMOS gate array.

## Abstract
A semiconductor integrated circuit includes p and n type semiconductor areas 10P and 10N alternately arrang ed in a row direction, p channel MOS transistor blocks arranged in each of the p type semiconductor areas 10P and each including two p channel MOS transistors TP11, TP12 , n channel MOS transistor blocks arranged in each of the n type semiconductor areas 10N and each including two n channel MOS transistors TN11, TN12 , and p and n type diffusion areas 27P and 27N formed, respectively, in each of the p type semiconductor areas 10P and each of the n type semiconductor areas 10N . The MOS transis tor blocks are arranged on two columns in each of the p and n type semiconductor areas 10P and 10N , and each of the diffusion areas 27P and 27N is formed in a position defined by the gate electrodes of four MOS transistors TP11, TP12, TN11, TN12 of the same channel type in the two MOS transistor blocks adjacent to each other in a row direction.
