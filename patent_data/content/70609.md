# Control device for a laundry drier.

## Abstract
A control device for a laundry drier of the kind in which mechanical movement of the laundry load in a drum causes the article s constituting the load to form an electrically resistive connection MSR between con tact electrodes 5 and 6 in the drum. An a.c. sensing current is fed from a transformer T1 via the load MSR and through a series capacitor C2 such that the voltage across the capacitor C2 is an inverse function of the state of dryness of the articles. This voltage is com pard in a comparator TR1 with a reference voltage Vref which is so chosen that the comparator TH1 gives an output signal when the articles of the load have reached a predetermined dryness. Any electrostatic charges de veloped in the load are suppressed by a unidirectional low impedance shunt comprising a diode D8 and a resistor R12 in series.
