# Process for dehalogenation of organic halides.

## Abstract
Halogenated species such as PCB dissolved in hydrocarbon based oils such as electrical insulating oils, turbine oils and crankcase oils are dehalogenated by con tacting the oil with a fine dispersion of molten sodium part icles of which at least 80 are below 10 microns particle size, at a temperature of 100 to 160 C. The process removes hazardous halogenated species and, after separation of excess sodium suspended solids and, if necessary, water washing, drying, and activated clay treatment, may permit the oil to be re used.
