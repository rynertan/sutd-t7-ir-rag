# Method of magnetic separation of cells and the like, and microspheres for use therein.

## Abstract
Magnetically responsive microspheres having Protein A associated with the outer surfaces thereof are reacted with antibodies selective to the cells, bacteria, or viruses to be separated from a mixed population to attach the antibodies in oriented relation with their Fab arms extending outwardly, and the microspheres are then used in a magnetic separation procedure. The preferred microspheres are prepared from a mixture of albumin, Protein A, and magnetic particles, the microspheres being prepared so that the Protein A is present in the exterior surfaces for antibody binding.
