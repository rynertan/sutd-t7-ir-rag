# Method for forming resist pattern.

## Abstract
A method for forming a highly precise resist pattern with good reproducibility has the steps of applying a resist ma terial to a substrate to form a resist film baking the resist film cooling the resist film in a controlled manner selec tively irradiating the resist film with one of electromagnetic waves in a predetermined wavelength range and particle beam having predetermined energy and developing the resist film to form a resist pattern.
