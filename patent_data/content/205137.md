## Description
TITLE DIELECTRIC COMPOSITIONS afield of Invention The invention relates to dielectric compositions and particularly to low firing temperature dielectric compositions.Background of the invention Because of their high volumetric efficiency and thus their small size, multilayer ceramic capacitors MLC s are the most widely used form of ceramic capacitors. These capacitors are fabricated by stacking and cofiring thin sheets of ceramic dielectric materials on which an appropriate electrode pattern is printed. Each patterned layer is offset from the adjoining layers in such manner that the electrode layers are exposed alternately at each end of the assemblage. The exposed edges of the electrode pattern are coated with a conductive material which electrically connects all the layers of the structure, thus forming a group of parallel connected capacitors within the laminated structure.Capacitors of this type are frequently referred to as monolithic capacitors. Metallizations useful in producing conductors for multilayer capacitors normally comprise finely divided metal particles applied to the green tape in the form of a dispersion of such particles in an inert liquid vehicle. The thin sheets of ceramic dielectric material used for the fabrication of MLC s are commonly referred to as green tapes and are comprised of a thin layer of finely divided dielectric particles which are bound together by an organic polymeric material. Unfired green tapes are prepared by slip casting a slurry of the dielectric particles dispersed in a solution of polymer, plasticizer and solvent onto a carrier surface, such as polypropylene, Mylare polyester film or stainless steel, and then adjusting the thickness of the cast film by passing the cast slurry under a doctor blade. Although the above described green taped process is more widely used, there are nevertheless other procedures with which dielectric compositions of the invention can be used to make MLC s. One technique is the so called Nwet process . In one aspect, this may involve passing a flat substrate through a falling sheet of dielectric slip one or more times to build up a dielectric layer see Hurley et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,717,487 . Another way of carrying out the wet process is to brush a number of thin layers of dielectric slip onto a substrate to build up a thick dielectric layer see Burn. U.S.Pat. No. 4,283,753 . Another method of making MLC s involves forming a paste of the dielectric material and then alternately screen printing the dielectric and metal layers with intervening drying steps until the designed structure is complete. A second electrode layer is then printed atop the dielectric layer s and the entire assemblage is cofired. Monolithic multilayer capacitors are typically manufactured by cofiring barium titanate based formulations and conductive electrode materials in oxidizing atmospheres at temperatures of 1200 1400 C. This process yields durable. well sintered capacitors with high dielectric constant, e.g., greater than 1000 However firing under these conditions requires an electrode material with high melting point, good oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures, sinterability at the maturing temperature of the dielectric, and minimal tendency to interact with the dielectric at the sintering temperature. These requirements normally limit the choice of electrode materials to the noble metals platinum and palladium, or to alloys of platinum, palladium and gold. See also U.S. 3,872.360 to J. L.Sheard which is directed to the preparation of monolithic multilayer capacitors. Significant savings in electrode costs could be realized if dielectric materials could be modified to 1 yield good die lectric properties high dielectric constant and low dissipation factor after firing in reducing atmosphe res so that base metals could be used as electrodes, and or 2 sinter at temperatures of 9500C or lower so that silver, which is significantly less costly than the other noble metals but has a lower melting point 9620C , could be used in electrode formation. Attempts have been made to modify barium titanate ceramics so that they may be fired in reducing e.g. hydrogen or inert e.g argon, nitrogen atmospheres. The use of this approach has been somewhat limited in that the electrical properties, e.g., dielectric constant, dissipation fa ctor, temperature coefficient of capacitance, etc., are compromised as compared with those of conventional air fired compositions. In addition, maintaining an inert or reducing atmosphere involves an additional production cost as compared to firing in air.Exemplary of this approach is Buehler, U.S. Pat. No.3,757,177, disclosing capacitors of base metal electrodes e.g., Ni, Co, Fe and modified barium titanate MnO , Fe2 3 CoO2. CaZrO3 fired in an inert atmosphere about 13000C col. 3, lines 33 34 . Several attempts have been made to reduce the maturing temperature of dielectrics by mixing high temperature ferroelectric phases titanates, zirconates, etc. with glasses which mature at relatively low temperatures. Examples of this approach are given in Maher U.S. Pat. No. 3,619,220,Burn U.S. Pat, No. 3,638,084, Maher U.S. Pat. No. 3,6B2,766, and Maher U.S. Pat. No. 3,811,937. The drawback of this technique is that the dilution effect of the glass often causes the dielectric constant of the mixture to be relatively low. Another technique for lowering the sintering temperature of titanate based dielectrics is by the use of sintering aids . Additions of bismuth oxide or bentonite to barium titanate lowers the maturing temperature to about 12000C. Nelson et al. U.S.Pat. No. 2,998,579 . Maturing temperatures of 12O00 12900C may be attained by addition of phosphates to titanates as described in Thurnauer et al. U.S. Pat. No. 2,626,220. However, in each of these cases, the decrease in maturing temperature is not sufficient to permit the use of cofired silver electrodes, and dielectric properties are often degraded. There existed a need for a composition which would produce a high dielectric constant e.g., 1000 or above and low dissipation factor e.g., less than 5 , preferably less than 2 and sinters in air at low temperatures e.g., less than 1000 C or less .This would permit cofiring with silver or palladium silver electrodes and hence would greatly reduce the cost of high dielectric constant multilayer capacitors.

No 3 suggestion was made as to the manufacture of multilayer capacitors. In a second article from the same laboratory, G. A. Smolenskii et al. SovietPhysics Solid State 3, 714, 1961 report investigating certain solid solutions, including those of Krainik et al. Firing was similarly done in a PbO vapor atmosphere. Phase transitions are discussed. In what is apparently a third article in this series, A. I. Zaslavskii et al. SovietPhysics Crystallography 7, 577, 1963 , s ray structural studies are reported. Brixner U.S. Pat. No. 3,472,777 discloses the manufacture of ferroelectric ceramic disks by a two step firing process. Each firing step is taught to occur in the range 8000 12000C in air. In the sole example, firing was at 10500C. Brixner discloses various dielectric compositions such asPbMg1 3Ti1 3W1 3O3 and Y containing compositions. More recently, Bouchard has approached the problem of dielectric compositions having low firing temperatures and dielectric constants as high as 6000 for use in Z5U type capacitors. These substituted lead titanate compositions correspond to the following formula SrxPb1 xTiO3 a PbMgrWsO3 b, wherein x 1 0 O.1O r 3 0.45 0.55 a 0.35 0.5 5 0.55 0.45 and b 1 0.5 0.65 S r s s 1, and a b 1.Such materials are disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,048,546, 4,063,341, and 4,228,482 all to Bouchard. Also, Thomas in U.S. Application S.N. 628,146, filedJuly 5, 198Q, discloses related low fire dielectric materials for Z5U service in which a 1 0.45 0.6 and b 1 0.5 0.65. More recently, U.K. Patent Application 2,115,400A discloses quite similar compositions which have low sintering temperatures corresponding to the formula PbTi Mg W O , in which x and y range from .25 to 0.35. These materials are made by mixing the corresponding metal oxides and calcining the mixture at 700 7500C. The materials are sintered at 800 9500C which is below the melting point of silver. Some of the compositions of the U.LC. application are identical in composition to those ofBouchard and are therefore expected to have the same properties. Notwithstanding the substantial progress in attaining higher dielectric constants, the electronics industry foresees the need for dielectric composition having still higher dielectric constants K on the order of 2500 and even higher for X7R type service. Dielectric materials for X7R type service find extensive use in electronic equipment for data processing, military applications, automotive applications, telecommunications and other applications in which the material is subjected to substantial changes in temperature, frequency and voltages. Among the properties which X7R dielectric materials must possess are a dissipation factor DF of no more than 2.5S, an insulation resistance IR of at least 1000 F and a thermal coefficient of capacitance TCC of no more than 15 within the range of 55 to 1250C.Brief DescriPtion of the Invention In view of the steadily more stringent requirements of the electronics industry for improved low firing dielectrics, the invention is directed to barium titanate based dielectric compositions suitable for X7R type service having dielectric constants above 2000, especially 2500 and higher. More particularly, the invention is directed in its primary aspect to a composition for forming a densified dielectric body at low firing temperatures which is a mixture of finely divided particles consisting essentially of a 99.2 99.95S wt. of an admixture of 1 97.10 99.48 mole BaTiO3 having an average particle size of not more than 1.5 um, 2 2.00 0.52 mole S of a metal oxide selected from Nub205, Ta205 and mixtures thereof, and 3 0 0.90 mole S of an oxide of a rare earth having an atomic number of 57 62 or mixtures thereof, and b 0.8 O.O5S wt. of a mixture of transition metal oxides having atomic numbers of 24 28, consisting essentially of 30 70 mole MnO2 and 70 30 mole of the oxide of at least one other such transition metal. In a secondasIiec9, the invention i s directed to a tape casting composition comprising the above described dielectric composition dispersed in a solution of binder polymer in a volatile nonaqueous solvent. In a third aspect, the invention is directed to a method of forming green tape by casting a thin layer of the above described dispersion onto a flexible substrate, such as a steel belt or polymeric film, and heating the cast layer to remove the volatile solvent therefrom. In a fourth aspect, the invention is directed to capacitors made by laminating and cofiring a plurality of the above described green tape layers on which an appropriate electrode pattern has been printed in an offset manner such that the edges of the printed electrodes from alternating layers are exposed at opposite ends of the laminated structure and the exposed ends of the patterned electrodes are each connected electrically by means of a conductive coating thereon. In a fifth aspect, the invention is directed to screen printable thick film compositions comprising the above described dielectric composition dispersed in organic medium.Prior Art Unexamined Japanese Patent Application 56 88876 discloses a dielectric composition consisting of 98.0 99.5 mole z BaTiO3, and 0.25 1.0 mole S of both Nd 0 and Nb O . It is disclosed that 23 25 0.5 0.4 wt. MnO2 or SiO can be added to the 2 composition to improve sintering characteristics. The compositions were fired at 1200 l300C. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONBarium Titanate It is essential that only high purity barium titanate be used in the composition of the invention.By high purity is meant that the material contains no more than about 0.2S by weight of such impuritie s as SiO2, Al2O3 and FexOy. If such impurities exceed about 0.2 by weight, the composition becomes difficult to sinter and the dielectric constant K is lowered. In addition to the importance of its chemical purity, it is essential that the BaTiO 3 have very fine particle size. In particular, the average particle size of the BaTiO must be no more 3 than about 1.5 em and preferably no more than 1.0 em. Primary Metal Oxide With respect to the primary metal oxides, Tea 205 and Nb205, neither their purity nor their particle size is especially important within reasonable and practical limits. Thus, they need not be of such high purity as the BaTiO3 and.furthermore, the primary metal oxide particles can be substantially larger. For example, such metal oxides can have an average particle size of up to 5 um. Nevertheless, it is still preferred that the average particle size of the primary oxides be no larger than about 3 trim. Rare Earth Oxide The rare earths contribute to improvement of all the electrical properties of the composition.However, their useful concentration is quite narrow.Though the presence of rare earth oxide is not always essential, it is nevertheless preferred to use at least 0.15 mole rare earth oxide to improve electrical properties, in some instances K values, in other instances IR or TCC. On the other hand, if more than 0.9 mole is used, such excessive concentrations also tend to lower K values. Thus, the concentration of rare earths in the composition of the invention is quite narrowly critical. Rare earth oxides which are suitable for the invention are limited to those rare earths having atomic numbers of 57 62 of which samarium Sm , neodymium Nd and praseodymium Pr are preferred.In a manner similar to the primary oxides, neither the purity nor particle size of the rare earth oxides is critical. Thus, the rare earth oxides, like the primary oxides, may have an average particle size of up to 5 em, though no more than 3 Bm is preferred. Though the rare earth oxides can be used in concentrations as high as 0.9 mole S, it is nevertheless preferred that the total of the primary metal oxide and the rare earth be less than 2,0 mole z in order that the K and IR values of the capacitors made therefrom not be lowered excessively,Transition Metal Oxide If less than 30 mole MnO2 is used, theIR of the composition is likely to be too low and if more than 70 mole MnO2 is used, TCC values tend to become too high, Thus it is preferred that theMnO2 constitute 30 70 mole s of the total of the transition metal oxides. The transition metal oxides for use in the invention are those of transition metals having atomic numbers of 24 28. It is essential that the mixture of transition metal oxides be comprised ofMnO2 and at least one other such transition metal oxide of which Nio is preferred.Fluxina Agent Though not essential, it may often be preferred to add to the dielectric compositions of the invention a small amount of fluxing agent for the purpose of lowering the sintering temperature of the composition. As used herein, the term flux11 or fluxing agentu refers to inorganic materials which are glass formers below the sintering temperature of the BaTiO3. Such materials will be most frequently utilized when it is desired to lower the firing temperature of the composition below about 1100 C. Suitable fluxing agents are vitreous at the firing temperature and have relatively low viscosity. Furthermore, they are at least partial solvents for the BaTiO during firing. Appropriate fluxing 3 agents include, but are not limited to, bismuth oxide. lithium tetraborate, cadmium borate, cadmium borosilicate, lead borosilicate, and lithium metaborate. It will also be recognized that stoichiometrically appropriate mixtures of the corresponding oxides can also be used. For example. a mixture of CdO and 203 can be used as a precursor for cadmium borate which is formed upon firing the composition. Mixtures of various fluxing agents can, of course. be used of which the mixture of 35 65 mole lithium tetraborate and 65 35 mole s bismuth oxide is particularly preferred. When fluxes are used in the composition of the invention, they will be used in concentrations of 0,1 1.5t wt. basis the total weight of component mixtures a and b .A flux concentration of 0.3 1.0 wt. is preferred.Within these concentration limits, the sintering temperature of the composition can be lowered without also excessively lowering the K value as well.Organic Medium Regardless of which method of application may be used, the above described mixture of organic solids must be dispersed in an organic medium.Though occasionally water based media can be used, the organic medium most commonly used will be for the purpose of making either green tape casting solutions or thick film pastes.A. Green TaPe Casting Solutions As mentioned above, green tapes of the dielectric composition of the invention are made by casting a dispersion of the dielectric material in a solution of polymeric binder and volatile organic solvent onto a flexible substrate. such as a steel belt or polymeric film. and then heating the cast layer to remove the volatile solvent therefrom. The organic medium in which the ceramic solids are dispersed consists of the polymeric binder which is dissolved in a volatile organic solvent and, optionally, other dissolved materials such as plasticizers, release agents. dispersing agents.stripping agents. antifouling agents and wetting agents. To obtain better binding efficiency, it is preferred to use at least 5S vol. polymer binder for 95S vol. ceramic solids. On the order of 25 35 vol.binder for 75 65t vol. ceramic solids is further preferred. It is desirable to use the least possible amount of binder vis i vis solids in order to reduce the amount of organics which must be removed by pyrolysis. In the past, various polymeric materials have been employed as the binder for green tapes.e.g., poly vinyl butyl , poly vinyl acetate , poly vinyl alcohol , cellulosic polymers such as methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, methylhydroxyethyl cellulose, atactic polypropylene, polyethylene, silicon polymers such as poly methyl siloxane , polytmethylphenyl siloxane , polystyrene, butadieneistyrene copolymer, polystyrene. poly vinyl pyrollidone , polyamides, high molecular weight polyethers, copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide1 polyacrylamides, and various acrylic polymers such as sodium polyacrylate, poly lower alkyl acrylates , poly lower alkyl methacrylates , and various copolymers and multipolymers of lower alkyl acrylates and methacrylates. Copolymers of ethyl methacrylate and methyl acrylate and terpolymers of ethyl acrylate. methyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid have been previously used as binders for slip casting materials. More recently, Usala. in U.S. PatentApplication S.N. 501a978, filed June 7. 1983, has disclosed an organic binder which is a mixture of compatible multipolymers of 0 100 wt. C18 alkyl methacrylate, 100 0 wt. C18 alkyl acrylate and 0 5S wt. ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid or amine. Because the polymers permit the use of minimum amounts of binder and maximum amounts of dielectric solids. their use is preferred with the dielectric composition of this invention. For this reason, the disclosure of the above referred Usala application is incorporated by reference herein. The solvent component of the casting solution is chosen so, as to obtain complete solution of the polymer and sufficiently high volatility to enable the solvent to be evaporated from the dispersion by the application of relatively low levels of heat at atmospheric pressure. In addition, the solvent must boil well below the boiling point and decomposition temperature of any other additives contained in the organic medium. Thus, solvents having atmospheric boiling points below 1500c are used most frequently. Such solvents include benzene, acetone, xylene, methanol, ethanol, methyl ethyl ketone, 1,1,1 trichloroethane, tetrachloroethylene, amyl acetate, 2,2,4 triethyl pentanediol 1,3 monoisobutyrate, toluene and methylene chloride. Frequently, the organic medium will also contain a small amount. relative to the binder polymer, of a plasticizer which serves to lower the glass transition temperature Tg of the binder polymer. However, the use of such materials should be minimized in order to reduce the amount of organic materials which must be removed when the films cast therefrom are fired. The choice of plasticizers is, of course, determined primarily by the polymer which must be modified. Among the plasticizers which have been used in various binder systems are diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, octyl phthalate. butyl benzyl phthalate, alkyl phosphates, polyalkylene glycols, glycerol. poly ethylene oxides , hydroxyethylated alkyl phenol, dialkyldithiophosphonate and poly isobutylene .Of these, butyl benzyl phthalate is most frequently used in acrylic polymer systems because it can be used effectively in relatively small concentrations.B. Thick Film Paste Often it may be desired to apply the compositions of the invention as a thick film paste by such techniques as screen printing. When the dispersion is to be applied as a thick film paste.conventional thick film organic media can be used with appropriate rheological adjustments and the use of lower volatility solvents. In this event, the compositions.must have approvr iste viscosity so that they can be passed through the screen readily. In addition, they should be thixotropic in order that they set up rapidly after being screened, thereby giving good resolution. While the rheological properties are of primary importance, the organic medium is preferably formulated also to give appropriate wettability of the solids and the substrate, good drying rate, dried film strength sufficient to withstand rough handling and good firing properties. Satisfactory appearance of the fired composition is also important. In view of all these criteria, a wide variety of inert liquids can be used as organic medium. The organic medium for most thick film compositions is typically a solution of resin in a solvent and, frequently. a solvent solution containing both resin and thixotropic agent. The solvent usually boils within the range of 130 3500C. Especially suitable resins for this purpose are polymethacrylates of lower alcohols and monobutyl ether of ethylene glycol monoacetate. The most widely used solvents for thick film applications are terpenes such as alpha or beta terpineol or mixtures thereof with other solvents such as kerosene, dibutylphthalate, butyl carbitol, butyl carbitol acetate, hexylene glycol and high boiling alcohols and alcohol esters. Various combinations of these and other solvents are formulated to obtain the desired viscosity and volatility requirements for each application. Among the thixotropic agents which are commonly used are hydrogenated castor oil and derivatives thereof. It is, of course, not always necess ary to incorporate a thixotropic agent since the solvent resin properties coupled with the shear thinning inherent in any suspension may alone be suitable in this regard. The ratio of organic medium to inorganic solids in the dispersions can vary considerably and depends upon the manner in which the dispersion is to be applied and the kind of organic medium used.Normally, to achieve good coverage, the dispersions will contain complementally by weight 60 90 solids and 40 101 organic medium. Such dispersions are usually of semifluid consistency and are referred to commonly as pastes, The pastes are conveniently prepared on a three roll mill.The viscosity of the pastes is typically within the following ranges when measured at room temperature on Brookfield viscometers at low, moderate and high shear rates l Shear Rate Sec Viscosity Pa.s 0.2 100 5000 300 2000 Preferred 600 1500 Most preferred 4 40 400 100 250 Preferred 140 200 Most preferred 384 7 40 10 25 Preferred 12 18 Most preferredThe amount and type of organic medium vehicle utilized is determined mainly by the final desired formulation viscosity and print thickness.Formulation Basically, the compositions of the invention are formulated merely by mixing the inorganic solids with the organic medium in a mixing apparatus such as a ball mill. Two or more of the inorganic solids may be premixed before addition to the organic medium, but the sequence and manner of mixing are not critical so long as uniform mixing and dispersion are obtained.However, to obtain a higher degree of mixing uniformity. it is preferred to premix the materials with water, mill the mixture and then dry it. After this the uniform mixture is mixed with organic medium.In the examples which follow, the compositions were formulated by adding all of the inorganic solids to the organic medium and then mixing.Capacitor Processing As described above. many multi layer capacitors are fabricated by printing on electrode metallization in the desired pattern upon a dielectric substrate which is a green tape. The printed dielectric substrates are stacked, laminated and cut to form the desired capacitor structures.The green dielectric material is then heated to effect removal of the organic medium from the electrode material and of the organic binder from the dielectric material. The removal of these materials is accomplished by a combination of evaporation and thermal decomposition during the firing operation.In some instances it may also be desirable to interpose a preliminary drying step prior to firing. When firing the above described capacitor assemblages, it is preferred to employ a first firing step in which the assemblage is heated slowly to l00 5500C, which will be effective to remove all of the organic material without damage to the laminated assemblage. Typically the organic burnout period is 18 24 hours to assure complete removal of organics. When this has been completed, the assemblage is then heated more rapidly to the desired sintering temperature. The . desired sintering temperature is determined by the physical and chemical characteristics of the dielectric material.Ordinarily the sintering temperature will be chosen to obtain maximum densification of the dielectric material. However, it will be recognized by those skilled in the art of fabricating capacitors that maximum densification is not always needed.Therefore the term nsintering temperature refers to the temperature and implicitly the amount of time as well to obtain the desired degree of densification of the dielectric material for the particular capacitor application. Sintering times also vary with the dielectric composition but ordinarily on the order of two hours at the sintering temperature is preferred. Upon completion of sintering, the rate of cooling to ambient temperature is carefully controlled in accordance with the resistance of the components to thermal shock. The following properties which are relevant to the ability of a given capacitor to function properly are referred to in the examples.CaPacitance Capacitance is a measure of the capability of a material to store an electrical charge expressed mathematically. C KAN divided by t, where K is dielectric constant. A equals area overlap of electrodes, N is number of dielectric layers, and t is thickness of dielectric layer. The units of capacitance are farads or fractions thereof such as microfarads 10 farad, nanofarads 10 farad or picrofarads 10 12 farad .Dissipation Factor Dissipation Factor DF is a measure of the phase difference between voltage and current. In a perfect capacitor the phase difference would be 90O. However, in practical dielectric systems, this phase difference is less than 90 by an amount because of leakage and relaxation losses. In particular, DF is the tangent of the angle A.Insulation Resistance Insulation Resistance IR is a measure of the ability of a charged capacitor to withstand leakage in DC current. Insulation resistance is a constant for any given dielectric regardless of capacitance. In the examples which follow, simple single layer capacitors having green thicknesses of 30 35 mils 762 889 um were prepared by stacking and then laminating an appropriate number of green tapes by pressing at about 2,000 psi 140 kg cm2 . The dielectric laminant was cut into 0.5 x 0.5 1.3 x 1.3 cm squares. Twelve such squares were prepared from each composition and tested. After being cut into such squares, each was heated to effect burnout of the organics. The firing profile after burnout was 1 3 hours up to firing temperature, 2 2 hours at the firing temperature, and 3 3 hours to exit from the furnace. Upon cooling the fired dielectrics.a silver electrode was applied on both sides of the laminant thus forming a single capacitor which is referred to as a K square. The K squares were tested for dielectric constant K , dissipation factor DF , insulation resistance IR and both cold and hot temperature coefficient of capacitance CTCC andHTCC. respectively . Temperature coefficient of capacitance is a measure of the percentage change in capacitance incurred upon heating a material over a specified range of temperature. In the case of CTCC.the temperature range is 55 to 250C and for HTCC.the temperature range is 25 C to 1250C. A TCC.either hot or cold, of 15 or less is considered to be satisfactory. If either value is substantially above 15 . the part is unsatisfactory for X7R specification use. The following examples and comparative showings are presented to illustrate the advantage of the present invention. EXAMPLES ExamPle6 1 37 A series of 37 dielectric mixtures having various compositions was prepared and formed into green tapes as described above.

This can be seen particularly well by comparing Example 2 withExamples 1, 3 and 4. Examples 5 8 show that as the amount of Nb is raised, the K value tends to be lowered.Nevertheless. the effect of the rare earth in raising K value is still evident. Example 9 illustrates that the use of very high Nb concentrations may lower K excessively. Examples 10 12 show that if the amount of Nb is too low, the HTCC value of the capacitor becomes more highly negative. In particular, Examples 10 and 11, which are low in Nb, have poor HTCC. On the other hand, when the Nb is too high. K tends to be degraded. For this reason, it is preferred that at least 0.52 mole Nb be used, but not more than 2.0 mole t. Example 12 is of interest in that it shows that if the total of the Nb and the rare earth is above about 2.0 mole S, the CTCC is likely to be too highly negative. Examples 13 and 15 illustrate the functional equivalence of Sm and Pr. Examples 14 and 15 show the necessity of the transition metal to obtain good HTCC. but that the amount must be limited to avoid too much lowering of the K value. Examples 15 19 show usefulness of Pr to replace Sm. In particularly. Examples 15 and 16 exhibit good TCC values. However. Examples 17 19 show the adverse effect on K if the concentration ofNb is too high. Examples 20 23 show the general suitability of other rare earths for use in the composition of the invention. Example 24 shows that if no transition metal oxide is used, both HTCC and CTCC are too negative,IR is lowered and DF is undesirably high. Example 25 shows the need for the second transition metal in order to obtain adequately high IR values.Similarly, Example 26 shows that if the second transition metal is present but nC is absent. 2 then both HTCC values are adversely affected. In contrast, Examples 27 and 28 which contain bothMnO2 and NiO exhibit good electrical properties throughout. Examples 29 31 show that the transition metals Co, Fe and Cr are functionally equivalent toNi in the composition of the invention. The Fe andCr tend to lower IR but not so much as to make them impractical for most applications. IR values of 2,000 or higher are quite satisfactory for almost all current uses. Examples 32 35 show that Ta is functionally equivalent to Nb in the compositions of the invention. Example 34 shows that lowering the amount of rare earth tends to lower both K and IR.Examples 36 and 37 Two sets of compositions were prepared in which a small amount of SiO2 was added to illustrate the adverse effect of impurities in theBaTiO3.

As would be expected the data on these devices in Table 3 show that the firing temperature could be reduced substantially with a concomitant lowering of K. Nevertheless, all electrical properties were satisfactory for most purposes.

A powder mixture was prepared by mixing the ingredients with water. milling. and drying. The dried mixture was mixed with organic medium to form a casting solution. This casting mixture was then used to form a green tape by the method described hereinabove and the green tape was used to form both single layer green K squares and five layer MLC green chips . The internal electrode material for theMLC s was 70 30 Ag Pd. The composition of the dielectric material, format, firing temperature and electrical properties are given in Table 4 below.All electrical properties were satisfactory.
