# Relay for pilot protection of electrical power lines.

## Abstract
Logic circuitry for a directional comparison blocking protec tive relay scheme is described. A forward reaching and a reverse reaching protective relay 38 located at the local and remote terminals of a protected line segment 43 determine whether a fault is internal or external to the protected line segment. To carry out this function, the protective relays produce signals 64, 70, 68, 62 representative of fault location and communicate with each other via a communications channel 65 . Processing the signals at each terminal is performed to determine the fault location and avoid tripping when the fault character changes. By using fault detectors to determine the existence of a fault, the logic at each terminal for combining the signals is simplified and security against false tripping is im proved.
