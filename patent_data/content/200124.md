# DECODING METHOD AND ENCODER DECODER FOR CYCLIC CODES

## Abstract
An encoder decoder for detecting and correcting a burst error of a cyclic code uses a two way feedback shift register including a chain of ℓ pieces of flip flops and exclusive OR gates corresponding to generator polynomials. A received code word is provided to the two way feedback shift register in a forward shift direction during a decoding mode. After inputting the received code word into the feedback shift register, if a syndrome is not equal to zero, the shifting direction of the feedback shift register is changed over, so that the shifting of the contents of the flip flops is repeated until a zero tester detects that outputs of selected ℓ m pieces of the flip flops become all zero. When the zezo tester detects the all zero, the contents of remained m pieces of the flip flops are provided as an error pattern of the received code word.
