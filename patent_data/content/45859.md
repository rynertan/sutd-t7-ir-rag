# Spark electrode assembly.

## Abstract
A spark electrode assembly 10 for a gas range igniter system is disclosed which is low in cost, easy to assemble, and reliable in operation. The assembly comprises a resi lient, electrically conductive support member 18 having a U shaped configuration and adapted for connection to the top frame of the gas range. An integrally molded insulator member 46 is connected to the support by means of a peripheral flange portion 50 which extends through rectan gular openings 38 formed in parallel leg portions 43, 44 of the support. The inward spring bias exerted by the legs of the support maintain the insulator assembled thereto. A barbed, wire connecting insert 60 is crimped to an electrical lead 58 and inserted into a bare 54 in the insulator. Barbs 64, 66 on the insert abut against the top surface of a wall 56 which extend inwardly radially from the internal wall of bore 54 and prevent removal of the electrical lead from the insulator.
