# Remote control assembly vibration dampening .

## Abstract
A motion transmitting remote control asembly 10 of the type for transmitting motion in a curved path by a flexible motion transmitting core element 12 includes a resilient vibration dampener 24 disposed between the support housing 22 and the end fitting 16 for providing noise and vibration isolation therebetween. A method for making the assembly 10 includes the steps of inserting the end portion of the conduit 14 into a cavity of a first mole and injecting organic polymeric material into the cavity for molding the end fitting about the conduit, inserting the end fitting 16 into a cavity of a second mold and injecting a vibration dampening material into the mold for molding a vibration dampener 24 about the end fitting 16 , and placing the vibration dampener 24 into a cavity of a third mold and injecting an organic polymeric material for molding a support housing 22 about the vibration dampener 24 .
