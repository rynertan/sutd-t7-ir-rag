# Rotational motion fluid loop sensor.

## Abstract
A rotational motion sensor has a circular, tubular body 1 filled with a fluid. A sensor head 6 forming part of the body 1 houses a movable detecting element in the form of a piston 7 which is magnetically levitated so that it is kept out of contact with the sensor body. Movement of the piston 7 is detected in a number of different ways including using a variable magnetic reluctance pick off 4, 5 .
