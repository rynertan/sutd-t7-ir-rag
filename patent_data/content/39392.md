# Stabilized magnetically sensitive avalanche transistor.

## Abstract
A new semiconductive device for sensing uniaxial magnetic fields is described. The sensor is essentially a dual collector lateral bipolar transistor operated in the avalanche region. Each of the collectors 1 exhibits two space charge resistance effects. One effect produces a negative resistance and the other produces a positive resistance. When the two space charge resistances are carefully balanced, a net zero collector resistance is achie ved. A balanced condition can be maintained for a broad range of collector currents. A vertical V I property is there by achieved. It has been found that the positive space charge resistance characteristic is inversely proportional to the ionization area and that the negative component is proportional to the area in the avalanche zone at each collector. It has been found that a magnetic field can mo dulate the ionization areas at the collector junctions. The area modulated results in modulation of the positive and negative space charge resistances at each collector and a resultant shift in the avalanche voltage occurs for each col lector. A differential output may be obtained since thei mo dulation effect operates oppositely on each of the collector junction areas. This mechanism accounts for the linear and differential magnetoresistive behavoir of the device.
