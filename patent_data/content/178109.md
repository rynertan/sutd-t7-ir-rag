# High reliability optical transmission systems.

## Abstract
In an optical transmission system, particularly a sub merged system, a line finding system is provided which, in the event of a fault somewhere along the system, enables the re maining operative lines or paths to take over the traffic and thus steer around the fault. The laser sources of the submerged repeaters and switched by electrical selection at their input using failed clock or a supervisory signal to achieve the switch ing.
