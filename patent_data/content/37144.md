## Description
CHROMIUM COMPLEXES AS DIETARYSUPPLEMENTS AND PHADACEUTICAL AGENTS Technical Field The instant invention relates to chromium III complexes an their use as dietary supplements and hypoglycemic pharmaceutical agents in humans and lower animals. Chromium has been determined to be an essential micronutrient for the maintenance of normal glucose tolerance in animals. The chromium cation exists in oxidation states of plus 1I, plus III and plus VI. Chromiwm II is very readily oxidized to chromium III on exposure to atmospheric oxygen. Chrom√¨um VI is toxic to man and animals. The chromium complexes used in this invention have the chromium cation in the III oxidation state. Chromium III is safe and required in a proper dietary regimen of animals and humans. Thus, as used herein, chromium is intended to mean the chromium cation in the III oxidation state. The action of chromium is closely associated with that of insulin. Chromium deficiency in humans has been reported as the cause of a reduced response of insulin sensitive tissue to the hormone, manifested by impaired glucose metabolism. The use of various chromium III salts for supplementing diets of mammals has been reported in the scientific literature. Persons particularly in need of chromium III supplementation include diabetics diabetes mellitus and those suffering from a dietary chromium deficiency. Chromium deficiency may result in impaired glucose metabolism in one or more of the following situations 1 dietary chromium deficiency, 2 juvenile onset diabetes, and 3 maturity onset diabetes. In the case of dietary chromium deficiency, if a mammal obtains less chromium from its diet than is used or excreted from the body on a daily basis, the resulting negative chromium balance will eventually deplete body sores of chromium te the point where many bodily functions, especially insulin sensitive processes, are impaired. Dietary supplementation with a form of chromium that is absorbable from the gastrointestinal tract and able to undergo biological interaction with insulin sensitive systems would alleviate this situation. In juvenile onset diabetes, there is essentially a complete cessation of insulin production by the pancreas.Lack of circulating insulin results in severe hyper glycemia. Insulin therapy is required to maintain normal blood glucose levels, but treatment is difficult and often results in wide variations in blood glucose values. In addition, it is known that elevate blood glucose results in mobilization of body stores of chromium which is then nearly quantitatively excreted in the urine. Thus, it is apparent that a victim of juvenile onset diabetes would mobilize and excrete more chromium than a normal individual. If this chromium is not replaced via the diet or by therapeutic supplementation, the resulting chromium deficiency may induce a refractory response to exogenous insulin, exacerbating the diabetic symptoms and requiring ever increasing doses of insulin to maintain normal blood glucose levels.A biologically active form of chromium, given either as a dietary supplement or as an adjunct to, or in combination with, insulin therapy, would help to prevent the development of this situation and, in some instances, allow the amount of insulin administered to maintain normal blood glucose levels to be substantially decreased. Maturity onset diabetes presents a different set of conditions, but with an end result similar to that of juvenile onset diabetes. In maturity onset diabetes, the pancreas continues to secrete insulin, often at higher nan normal levels. However, due to impaired tissue sensitiity or defective insulin, this endogenous insulin e ic s little or no physiological response. Normal blood glucose levels are approximated either by injection of exogenous insulin or by oral administration of hypo glycemic drugs which stimulate the pancreas to produce even more insulin.As in juvenile onset diabetes, the abnormally high blood glucose levels would be expected to lead to increased chromium mobilIzation and excretion, resulting in eventual chromium deficiency and aggravation of the diabetic situation. Since chromium is necessary for optimum in vivo action of insulin, the importance of improving the effectiveness of insulin in a maturityonset diabetic by administering an absorbable and effiicacious form of chromium is clear. In those diabetic individuals who are chromium deficient, this would allow lowering the total dosage of insulin or oral hypoglycemic drug, even to the point that administration of insulin or oral hypoglycemic drugs could be halted without affecting the patient. One paradox of chromium deficiency is that while many foods naturally contain entirely adequate levels of chromium, the chromium is lost during processing. With the advent and prevalence of processed foods, it has become increasingly necessary to supplement the diet with chromium. This task has proved to be difficult because the chemical form in which chromium IiI is presented to the body is highly determinative of its extent of absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, and thus its bioactivity, at effective, yet safe dosage levels. It is an object of the present invention to provide chromium III in a stable, yet metabolically useful, form. In accordance with this invention, certain chromium III complexes in safe and effective amounts can be used to treat impaired glucose metabolism due to diabetes mellitus, as well as to treat more generalized problems associated with chromium deficiency. Background Art Many of the chemically familiar chromium compounds have been found to be ineffective for delivering chromium III ions orally to the body. Accordingly, efforts to treat mammals in need of the chromium III ion have involved the use of organic complexes of chromium which are somewhat ill defined and rather unstable. U.S. Patent 3,914,410, Godfrey 1975 discloses addition of trace amounts of certain chromium salts to sugar to produce a fortified composition which is said to reduce the severity or incidence of atherosclerosis or adult onset diabetes. Unrefined sugar contains appre cable quantities of chromium, but as the sugar is reined the chromium is removed. U.S. Patent 3,925,433, Abdel Monem, et al. 1975 describes complexes formed between chromium and a amino acids. The chromium in these complexes is said to be reaaily absorbed, cistributed and utilized within the biochemical system of animals and humans. The rate of absorption and distribution is said to be substantially higher than that of onromium chloride. Shwartz and Mertz, Archives of Biochemistry andBiophysics, Vol. 85, p. 293 1959 state that very stable chromium complexes, for example the bidentate chromium acetylacetonate and several ethylenediamine complexes, seem to be metabolically inert. Mertz, Nutrition Reviews 33, No. 5, p. 130 May 1975 states that simple chromium compounds, for example the chloro, aquo, or acetate coordinate chromium compounds or complexes, do not meet the criteria of absorption and bioavailability needed for use as cofactors for insulin. Disclosure of Invention EPO Patent Application N 80200219.6 filed March 7, 1980 publication N 0016496, discloses the use of chromium III acetylacetonate as a dietary supplement, in conjunction with insulin, and the like. The present invention employs non acetylacetonate chromium III complexes of the formula A EMI6.1 wherein the substituent groups are as follows X and X 0, Nn, S, NR1 Y and Y alkyl, aryl, H, CO2R2, SR1, OR1, perfluoroalkyl1 perfluoroaryl Z 1i102 H, CO2R2, NHCOR1,CN, OR1, COR1, SCN,EMI6.2 perfluoroalkyl, alkyl, aryl, perflucroaryl, specifically excluding halogen with R1 as C1 C22 alkyl or aryl √®.g. , phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, and the like and R2 as C1 C22 alkyl groups Y and can be the same or different, and X and X can be the same or different, provided that when X and X are both oxygen, and Y and Y are both methyl, Z is a substituent other than hydrogen. It is to be understood that the chromium III complexes herein ere hexacoordinated, Accordingly, mixtures of the complexing agents can be used to form mixed chromium complexes of the foregoing type. The present invention encompasses the use of the aforesaid chromium complexes as dietary supplements. This invention also provides a convenient method for supplementing foods from which the naturally occurring chromium has been removed by means of the disclosed bioavailable, bioactive chromium complexes. This invention also encompasses a method for treating diabetics comprising administering safe and effective amounts of the aforesaid chromium complexes. Chromium is known to be a co factor for insulin.Accordingl, this invention also provides a method for treating diabetic patients by concurrently administering safe and elective amounts of the cnromium complexes and insulin to the diabetic. The heat stability of the onromium complexes em ployed herein allows them to be incorporated in food products prepared at high temperatures without loss of nutritional value. Examples of such food products include those obtained from soybean protein. In accordance with the foregoing, the instant invention encompasses the aforesaid chromium complexes in unit dosage forms, in combination with insulin, in com bination with hypoglycemic agents, and in foods and dietary supplements, e.g., vitamin mineral preparations. Best Mode The chromium III complexes of the present invention are know n materials, and their syntheses form no part of this invention. Appropriate syntheses of these complexes are disclosed in the literature, as described more fully hereinafter. Of the several types of chromium III complexes encompassed by formula A, hereinabove, the folloing are preferred compounds of formula A wherein X and X are each oxygen, Y and Y are each hydrogen and Z can be H i.e., malonaldehyde complex compounds wherein X and X are each 0, Y is H, Y is CH3 and Z can be H i.e., 3 oxobutanal complex both cis and trans compounds whereinX and X are each 0, Z is H, and Y and Y are each phenyl compounds wherein X is O, X is N phenyl or N substituted phenyl such as p tolyl, o tolyl, and the like, and Y, Y and Z are each H and compounds wherein X and X are eachO, Y and Y are each CF3, and Z is H. Of the foregoing compounds, the malonaldehyde and 3 oxobutanal complexes cis and trans are most preferred. Within the realm of sound medical judgment, the dosage of chromium complex will vary with the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition, and the duration cf treatment employed. However, single dosage amounts range frorn 0.15 to 100 micrograms g of chromium as complex per kg of body weight, preferably 1 to 10 vta per kg. Unless otherwise specified, the unit designated g per kg as used herein refers to g Cr per kg of body weigh.. The higher dosages within this range are usually employed for therapeutic use in cases of severe chromium deficiency and in diabetes therapy, whereas the lower dosages are appropriate for maintaining adequate dietary chromium levels. For therapuetic use, up to 4 dosages per day can be used routinely, but this can be varied with the needs of the patient, consistent with a sound benefit risk ratio. Preferably, dosages ranging from about 1 g to about 10 g per kg are employed when the chromium complex is administered orally. For parenteral administration subcutaneous, intra peritoneal, intramuscular dosages are preferably from about 0.5 to about 70 ug per kg per day. For long term parenteral infusion intravenous the most highly preferred dosage range is from about 0.15 to about 15 ug per kg per day. The chromium complexes are sparingly soluble in water. Parenteral administration can be carried out in ethanol water mixtures. For purposes cf oral administration, the chromium complexes can conveniently be formulated as capsules, tablets or granules. Convenient unit dosage forms of the chromium complexes comprise from about 1.5 g to about 0.07 grams of chromium as the complex and a pharmaceutical carrier. For treatment of non human animals, the chromium complexes are preferably incorporated in animal feed, feed supplements or feed concentrates. The preferred concentration range of the chromium complexes as described hereinabove in unit dosage forms intended for use by humans and small domesticated animals is rom about 0.15 g to about 300 ug o Cr, more pre erably from 50 g to 250 g of Cr. h higher concen tration range from about 0.3 mg cf Cr to about 200 mg oCr is the preferred it dosage for intended for treat ment of larger, non ruminant animals, e.g., horses and the like. Convenient compositions for oral administration of the chromium complexes can also take the form of troches, chewable tablets and foodstuffs. The term pharmaceutical carrier as used herein denotes any of the usual pharmaceutical excipients, including solid cr liquid fillers, diluents, tableting aids, encapsulating substances, and the like. Some examples of the substances which can serve as pharmaceutical carriers or the chromium complexes include sugars, such as lactose, clucose an sucrose starches, such as cornstarch and potato starch cellulose and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, ethylcellulose, cellulose acetate and powdered tragacanth malt gelatin talc stearic acids magnesium stearate calcium sulfate vegetable cils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and oil of theobroma polyols, such as propylene glycol, glycerine, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethyleneglycol agar alginic acid saline and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non toxic, compatible substances typically used in pharmaceutical formulations. Wetting agents and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, as well as coloring agents, flavoring agents and preservatives can also be present. Tableting is done using conventional techniques. Gelatin capsules are another mode of ad ministration. The pharmaceutical carrier employed in conjunction with the chromium complexes is used at a concentration sufficient to provide a practical size to dosage re lationship. Pre er2bly, the pharmaceutical carrier comprises from about 0.18 to about 99 by weight of total composition. The chromium complexes can be conveniently included in standard vitamin, mineral or mixed vitamin mineral compositions to provide an excellent dietary supplement.The chemical and heat stability of the complexes assures that they will not undesirably interact with various foodstuffs, vitamins, minerals, and pharmaceutical excipients. It will be appreciated that the present invention is useful not only in humans but also in lower animals in treating similar disease states involving the impairment of glucose metabolism and for general overall health and well being. Animal feed compositions to which the chromium complexes of this invention can be added generally include as foodstuffs a cellulosic roughage component such as hay, straw, plant hulls, corn cobs, and the like.Protein containing components such as whole grains, in clung corn, wheat, barley, oats, rye, millet and alfalfa are typically included. As disclosed hereinabove, the chromium complexes employed in the practice of the present invention can be prepared using art disclosed procedures, or obvious modifications thereof. The following articles, incorporated herein by reference, describe such procedures in great detail. The preparation of tris l,3 propanedialato chromium III , i.e., the preferred malonaldehyde Cr III complex herein, is described in detail in INORGANIC SYNTHESESVol. VIII, pages 141 143, 1966. The preparation of the preferred cis and trans 3 oxobutanal complex, specifically cis anc trans tris 3 oxobutanalato chromium III is described in the same volume of INORG2STC SYNTHESES, pages 144 148. Likewise, the preparation of tris 4 ptoluidino 3 penten 2 onato chromium III appears in the same volume, pages 19 153. The synthesis of tris l,3diphenyl 1,3 propanedionato chromium III and tris 1,1,1trifluoro 2,4 pentanedionato chromium III are reported in INORGANIC SYNTHESES, Vol. VIII, pages 135 140, 1966.Collman, et al., . Org. Chem. 28, 1449 55 1963 , report the synthesis of tris 3 acetyl 2,4 pentanediono chromium III . Collman, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 83, 3529 30 1961 , describe the synthesis of nitro and other chromium III compounds. Heath, et al., Aust. J.Chem, 1972, 25, 2547 51, describe the synthesis of chromium III complexes of formula A, wherein X and X are each sulfur, i.e., tris dithioacetylacetonato chromium III . The syntheses of various compounds of formula A wherein is nitrogen are reported by Collman, et al., Inorganic Chemistry Vol. 1, No. 3, August 1962, pages 99 503. The chemical and heat stability of the chromium complexes disclosed or use herein allows them to be formulated in all manner of compositions without loss of nutritional value. Thus, the chromium complexes of formula A can be used as diet supplements in food, in unit dosage forms, as additives to other diet supplements such as vitamins and minerals, and in combination with insulin solutions and various hypoglycemic agents. The known forms of insulin regular, prompt, insulin zinc and crystalline zinc, Semilente , isophane insulin suspension NPH insulin and insulin zinc suspension, Lent globin zinc insulin, protamine zinc insulin suspension, extended insulin zinc suspension Ultralente , are all useful in pharmaceutical mixtures with the chromium complexes cf formula A. for Intramuscular injection. The oral hypoglycemic agents useful with the chromium complexes in the minner of this invention are of the known commercial types. They include the sulfonylurea compounds tolbutamide, chlorpropamide, acetohexamide and tolazamide and the bisguanide compound phenformin. The dosage of insulin will, of course, be determined by the attending physician, according to the needs of the patient. In the present invention, from about 5 units to about 70 units of insulin will be aar.inistered per day concurrently with the chromium complex. Likewise, the oral dosage OT non insulin hypoglycemic agents can be adjusted to the needs of the individual patient, but generally ranges from about 0.5 5. to about 5 g., on a daily basis, depending, of course, on the ty e of hypoglycemic agent.
