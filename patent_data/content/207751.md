## Description
F BRONECTINS Fibronectins FNs constitute a class of high molecular weight glyco proteins that have a key role in various contact processes of the vertebrates such as cell attachment and spreading, cell migration, control of cell morphology, differentiation and oncogenic transformation.All these biological activities imply interaction of FN with cells and with extracellular materials. Binding activities for collagen. heparin, fibrin, cell surfaces, bacteria and DNA have been located in different domains of the FN molecule for review, see Yamada, 1983 . FN is one of the most versatile known proteins, both functionally and structurally. FN molecules are usually dimers of similar but not identical polypeptides of MW 250,000. Cellular FN is found in a fibrilar component of the extracellular matrix of fibroblasts and other cell types. Plasma FN is a soluble molecule present in high concentrations in plasma 300pg ml and probably involved in opsonization, wound healing and haemostasis Yamada, 1983 Hynes Yamada, 1982 .Partial primary structure data have revealed high conserved amino acid sequences both between the two FN forms and among FNs from different species bovine plasma Petersen et al, 1983 , bovine cellular Xornblihtt et al, 1983 , human plasma Pande 6 Shively 1982 Garcia Pardo et al, 1983 , human cellular Kornblihtt et al, 1983, 1984a Oldberg et al, 1983 , rat plasma Schwarzbauer et al, 1983 . These data have tended to confirm that the basic FN polypeptide contains three different types of internal repeats homology types I, XI and III, approximately 40, 60 and 90 amino acids long respectively, as originally shown in bovine plasma FN Skorstengaard et al, 1982 Petersen et al, 1983 .Variations on this basic fibronectin structure account for the differences between cellular and plasma fibronectins and also between the polypeptide chains of both forms. The diverse forms of fibronectin seem to be generated by transcription of a single gene into a common precursor which undergoes alternative splicing Vibe Pedersen et al, 1984 . To date, at least two regions have been described where this type of variation occurs. In certain human cell lines fibroblasts, Hs578T FN mRNAs can be distinguished by a 270 nucleotide segment ED that encodes exactly one of the homology type III. This ED segment seems to be absent in the liver hepatocyte mRNAs which are the source of plasma FN Kornblihtt et al, 1983, 1984b .Schwarzbauer et al 1983 have reported three different FN mRNAs arising by alternative splicing in rat liver which differ in an area IIICS located to the 3 carboy terminus side in the protein of the ED region. The difference sequence does not belong to any of the known internal homologies and it is inserted between the last two type III homology repeats, near the COOH terminus. In addition, Umezawa et al 1985 have reported further variations in the equivalent IIICS area of human liverFN mRNA, bringing the total to 5 alternative motifs for this area.The differences observed between FN polypeptides are thus the consequence of internal primary sequence variability Kornblihtt et al, 1984a 1984b Schwarzbauer et al, 1983 , due to alternative splicing in at least two distinctive regions of the pre mRNA Tamkun et al, 1984 Vibe Pedersen et al, 1984 Umezawa et al, 1985 . The complete amino acid sequence of mature human Ff polypeptides has now been determined from the nucleotide sequence of multiple cDNA clones as described below. The polypeptide length varies from 2146 to 2325 amino acids, depending on which internal alternative splicing has taken place. The present invention thus makes it possible to provide any desired part of the fibronectin molecule and in particular polypeptides having each of the separate binding activities of fibronectin separate from the others. In the accompanylng Figure 2, the binding sites of each part of the FN amino acid sequence are given. While sont of these werc previously known, the sequence for the human collagenbinding site lines 8 13 in the Figure is new. Lint 9 and 10, involving the type II homology, are believed to be of particular significance, and to incorporate most or all of the collagen binding ability. The present invention thus provides novel polypeptides having substantially the amino acid sequence fro 277 to 57, shown in Figure 2, or any continuous part thereof having collagcr binding activity, and especially the sequence from 379 to 445. In practice such polypeptides may be linked to further awino acid residues not affecting the desired end use of the collagen binding polypeptide, including additional residues of the fibronectin molecule itself. Similarly other sequences of the fibronectin molecule may be utilized for their ability to bind to other molcules.This, as shown in Figure 2, the polypeptide sequence frcm 21 to 241 is associated with binding to fibrin, heparin andStaphylococcus aureus. Other sequences are, as shown, associated with binding to DNA, cells and alternative heparin and fibrin binding sites. The novel polypeptides may be made by culturing cells containing endogenous DNA coding for the polypeptide and separating the polypeptide from the metabolic products.Thus, the appropriate DNA sequences may be cloned into a competent strain of E.coli or other microorgansm, e.g. a yeast such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the latter cultivated, and then the desired polypeptide isolated from the cultivation products. Figure 3 shows the complete DNA sequence for fibronectin and the associated amino acid residues, and from this the cNDA sequence required for cloning the expression of any desired part of the fibronectin molecule may be easily determined. The DNA sequence coding for the collagen binding polypeptide runs from coordinate 1147 to coordinate 1351, and the sequence coding for the fibrin binding polypeptide runs from coordinate 73 to 738. More particularly, however, in accordance within Y pE imtim, the clones herein described as pFH54, pFH134, pFH16 and pFH6 and similar clones may be used to produce corresponding polypeptides by expression in E. coli or other appropriate microorganisms.pFHl34 and pFH16 contain the DNA sequence for the collagen binding part of the fibronectin molecule and map be used to generate a polypeptide having the collagen binding activity of fibronectin without its other binding affinities.pFH6 can be used to transform competent E. coli for the expression of a polypeptide binding fibrin and heparin. The manner in which the clones pFH54, pFH134, pFH16 and pFH6 were obtained is described below, and repetition of the methods referred to will give sinilar clones with essentially the same or only slightly different utility.It will be appreciated in this connection that the isolation of useful cDNA sequences using tne total cellular RNA from an appropriate source, i.e. cells naturally capable of expressing the desired protein or polypeptide, is a matter of routine experimentation for the person skilled in the art using the currently available techniques, particularly when, as is the case here, the actual amino acid sequence for the desired protein or polypeptide and the corresponding DNA sequence are both known. Trite experimental section below mentions appropriate techniques which have been found to be effective but it is to be expected that other known techniques would be equally applicable. Similarly choice of appropriate sources of RNA, vectors, and competent microorganisms for transformation from the many materials which are now available to the experimentalist is well within the ordinary skill in this art. It will be appreciated that when a desired aminoacid sequence of fibronectin is expressed by a transformed microorganism it may be associated with a polypeptide characteristic of the microorganism itself. This may be immaterial to the intended use of the polypeptide but, in some cases, eg. if the polypeptide is to be usd in ti erap, the presence of the additional amino acid residues may be unacceptable. In that case the polypeptide must be subjected to an additional treatment, eg. with a protease, to separate the desired polypeptide free from undesired additional amino acid residues. As indicated above, the present invention is of especial interest in that it provides a means for transforming an appropriate microorganism to make it capable of expressing a polypeptide able to bind to collagen and or fibrin. A polypeptide able to bind to collagen can be used, for example, to facilitate affinity purification of valuable polypeptides. Thus if the collager, binding polypeptide is expressed in a form in which it is bound te another polypeptide of interest or if it is linked, after isolation, to such a polypeptide, the combined polypeptldes may be purified by affinity chromatograph on a column cf bound gelatin i.e. collagen , and then, after the purification, the desired polypeptide may be separatea, eg. by an enzymatic hydrolysis, from the collagen banding polypeptide. A polypeptide able to bind to fibrin may be used in therapy to target a therapeutic agent on natural fibrar., eg. a blood clot. For example, a fibrinolytic enzyme bound to the polypeptide would have improved clotdissolving properties, since it would have improved adilesion to its target. In the accompanying drawings, Fig. 1 shows a restriction enzyme map of seven cDNA clones covering 769 nucleotides from the poly A tail of human FK mRNA.Human FN mRNA has been estimated to be 7900 nucleotides long Kornblihtt et al, 1983 . The clones cover the complete coding region for the mature protein bottom diagram showing binding sites and the 3 non coding regionThe dotted lines indicate segments that are absent from the corresponding cDNA clones but that must have been synthesized in the first strand cDNA reaction and that were lost as a result of the failure of the Klenow enzyme to complete the second cDNA strand. Numbering on the map is in base pairs. Fig. 2 shows the complete amino acid sequence of a human FN polypeptide. Residues 1 and 2325 are the NH2 and COOH termini of the mature protein. The sequence was deduced from the nucleotide sequence see Figure 3 of the cDNA clones depicted in Fig. 1. Alignment shows internal homologies. Gaps were introduced to maximize the homology. Identical residues within a type of homology are boxed. The cell recognition tetrapeptide RGDS Pierschbacher Ruoslahti, 1984 is underlined. Positions 17 Ser , 21 cys and 42 Val are reported as Cys, Ser and Ala respectively by Garcia Pardo et al 1983 . The FN polypeptide shown in this Figure has 2325 residues with a MW 255,905.If the mass contributed by the carbohydrate side chains, estimated to be 9t of the protein mass Yamada, 1983 , is added, the molecular weight of thisFN polypeptide would increase to approximately 279,000. This figure appears to be considerably higher than the weights of the FN monomers estimated by SDS PAGE 230 250,000 . The discrepancy could be explained by tne poor resolution of the SDS gels in the range of high molecular weight proteins together with the lack of appropriate protein standards in that range. Symbols are as follows , free SH groups , sites for carbohydrate side chains , cleavage site for chymotrypsin. A , cleavage site for plasmin. The multiple fibronectin polypeptides can be generated by all the possible permutations of the alternative splice regions in lines 26 and 30 as explained below .

Xrlf2, 4 and 6 were isolated from a rat liver cDNA library Schwarzbauer et al, 1983 , pFHLl and B from a human liver cDNA library, and pFHl was isolated from the Hs578T cell line cDNA library Xornblihtt et al, 1983 . It will be noted that all the variations include the zones binding to collagen and fibrin. Figure 5 shows, in more detail than Figure 1, part of the fibronectin protein indicating the position of the collager. binding domain and internal homologies I, II, and III .Below, the position and sizes in base pairs of the series cf cDNAs used in the bacterial expression experiments described below is indicated. Only the restriction enzyme sites relevant to the cDNAs pXP B are shown. The flanking HindIII and Bam Hl sites of pFH134 and pFH16 occur in the polylinker of the vector. Figure 1 shows the restriction map of different cDNA clones covering the 3 non coding region and the complete coding region for the mature protein of human FN mRNA. The isolation of clones pFH1, pFHlll and pFH154 has been previously described Kornblihtt et al, 1983, 1984a and nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the latter has been published before Kornblihtt et al, 1984b . The clones pFH54, pFHl34, pFH16 and pFH6 are new. Isolation of these four cDNA clones covering the 5 third of the map involved the synthesis of an oligonucleotide primer. The sequence namely 5 GCTGAACCATTTGCTGAGC of the primer was complementary to the mRNA sequence of a region close to the 5 end of clone pFH154. The oligonucleotide was used to prim reverse transcription of total RNA from Hs578T cells Hackett et al, 1977 and a cDNA library was prepared as described below. The clones pFH54, pFH134, pFH6 and pFHl6 were selected for further analysis. The complete nucleotide sequence of these clones was determined and comprised 7692 bp, of which 6972 bp correspond to the coding region and 720 bp to the 3 nontranslatable region and poly A tail.The sequence is included in the full DNA sequence for FN shown in Figure 3. The amino acid sequence of human fibronectin deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the clones inFigure 1 is shown in Figure 2. The alignment in Figure 2 maximises internal homologies. The complete FN chain presents regions which have 3 different types of internal homologies types I, II and III Petersen et al, 1983 and regions which have no homologous counterparts within the molecule. The latter are the NH terminal and COOHterminal segments and the internal connecting strands.FronNH2 to COOH terminus, FN is formed by one 20 residue long NH2 terminal segment Fig. 2, line 1 , five units of type I homology or fingers lines 2 to 6 , one connecting strand line 7 , one finger line 8 , two units of type II homology lines 9 and 10 , three fingers line 11, 12 ard 13 , one unit of type III homology line 14 , one connecting strand line 15 , fourteen units of type III homology lines 16 to 29, including the ED polypeptide , one connecting strand IlICS, line 30 , one unit of type 111 homology line 31 , one connecting strand line 32 , three fingers lines 33, 34 and 35 and the COOH terminal segment line 36 . The primary structure of FN reflects a level of order and complexity not seen before in any other protein. The symmetry in the array of the 16 units of type III homology is particularly interesting. Two type III units Fig. 2, lines 14 and 31 are separated by connecting strands lines 15 and 30 from a central block, having the remaining fourteen in a juxtaposed way. The degree of homology within the type III units is very high. Threc residues are conserved in all the units, viz Trp Fig. 2, box with residue 599 at the top , Leu box with residue 640 at the top and Tyr box with residue 646 at the top . The conserved residues are distributed in two peaks around the Trp and the Tyr, separated by a valley of non homology. is biieved that the degree of order and conservation in the type III sequences must reflect particular constraint of the secondary structure of tne central region ofFN. This region is not stabilized by disulphide bridges since the only two Cys residues present in the type III sequences positions 1201 and 2075 inFigure 2 have been shown to exist in a reduced forn Vibe Pedersen et al, 1982 Smith et al, 1982 . Several binding activities have been assigned to different regions of the FN molecule see Figs 1 and 2 .However, only in the case of the ability to bind cells, hac the actual binding site been identified so far. In fact, Pierschbacher and Ruoslahti 1984 demonstrated that the tetrapeptide Arg G1y Asp Ser RGDS is responsible for the cell attachment activity of FN. This tetrapeptide is present only once in the sequence of Fig. 2 at positions 1493 to 1496, within one of the type III units. Fig. 2 also shows that the optimal alignment of the type III sequences in this area is obtained only if the tetrapeptidt is considered to be an extra element, allowing four gaps in the corresponding regions of the rest of the type III units.It is probable that, as well as the cell binding site, other binding sites or biological activities within type III sequences reside in non conserved stretches.The tetrapeptide has also been found in other proteins Pierschbacher 6 Ruoslahti, 1984 including thedchain of fibrinogen which shows cell attachment activity. An important feature of FN gene expression is the generation of slightly different polypeptides by differential processing of the common mRNA precursor Vibe Pedersen et al, 1984 . Figure 4A shows diagrams,aticaily the localization of the two regions of variability observed so far along the FN molecule Schwarzbauer et al, 1983 Kornblihtt et al, 1984a 1984b . Figures 4B and 4C show the types of polypeptide that can arise frown the translation of the different mRNAs generated in the ED Fig. 2 line 26 and lllCS Fig. 2, line 30 regions respectively. This diagram combines observations made on both human and rat fibronectin. At least 10 differentFN polypeptides can be generated from a single gene if it be assumed that all the permutations between the ED andIIICS segments are possible.This is consistent with theFN polypeptide heterogeneity observed in the bidimensional gel electrophoresis analysis of cellular and plasma FNs found in vivo. Homo or hetero dimeric FN molecules can then be formed from the FN polypeptide pool. The biological significance of this complex situation is not yet clear. However, it is to be noted that the ED and I1ICS variable regions are intercalated between the cell heparin and heparin fibrin binding sites. The distance between these biologically active sites of the molecule may be critical for the FN function. For example, plasmaFN is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude less active than cellular fibronectin in restoring morphology and alignment to a transformed fibroblast cell line Yamada Kennedy, 1979 Further the mRNAs carrying the ED segment are presert in fibroblasts one source of cellular FN but not in liver cells one source of plasma FN Kornblihtt et al, 1984b . It is possible that the function of the ED is to increase the distance between the cell binding tetrapeptide and th,c heparin binding site, resulting in an enhanced binding activity of the cellular FN molecule. EXPERIMENTALRNA Preparation Human cell line Hs578T Hackett et al, 1977 was cultured in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium containing 10t foetal calf serum. Total RNA was extracted from confluent cell monolayers by the guanidine HCl method Chirgwin et al, 1979 . Between 2 and 4 mg of total Rt i 8 were extracted from 4 x 10 cells. Other sources of RNA could be used if preferred, eg. fibroblasts or liver cells.Isolation of fibronectin cDNA clones All the cDNA clones depicted in Figure 1 were obtained using Hs578T cell RNA as template. Isolation o clone pFH1 by oligonucleotide probing was described byKornblihtt et al 1983 . Isolation of clones pFH11l and pFH154 by mRNA walking oligonucleotide priming was described by Kornblihtt et al 1984a . This latter procedure was used for the isolation of the new clones pFH54, pFH134, pFH16 and pFH6. An oligoncleotide primer complementary to the mRNA region close to the 5 end of pFH154 was synthesized by the method of Gait et al 198C .The oligonucleotide was used to prime reverse transcription of total RNA from Hs57ST cells Hackett et al, 1977 .Blunt ended ds cDNA was prepared and cloned into the plasmid pAT153 Pvull 8 Anson et al, 1984 in E. coliMC1061 as previously described Kornblihtt et al, 1983 .Colonies were screened using as probe a restriction fragment from the 5 end of pFH154 lacking the primer sequences, labelled by filling in at one end. In this way, clones pFH54 and pFH134 were obtained. In a second step, clones pFH16 and 6 were obtained by screening with an end labelled probe for the 5 end of clone pFH134. Restriction fragments of the fibronectin cNDA were fi0e in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and blunt end ligated into Smal cut phosphatased pEX 1, 2 or 3 vector.Transformations were carried out using the E. coli strainLKllI Zabeau et al, 1982 harbouring the plasmid pc1857 which specifies kanamycin resistance and carries the c1857 allele Remaut et al, 1983 . Colonies were transferred to Whatman 541 filter paper Gergen et al, 1985 and screened with either 3 end labelled Maxam et al, 1977 or nick translated probes Rigby et al, 1977 . Sequence determination Inserts from clones were excised fron the vector DNA by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes, separated in agarose gel electrophoresis, and recovered by electroelution Girwitz et al, 1980 . Most of the sequencing was performed by the chemical degradation procedure of Maxam and Gilbtrt 1980 . Some regions were sequenced by the chain terminator method Sanger et al, 1977 . For that purpose, the relevant fragments were isolated, digested either with Alul or HaeIII and ligated to a Smal digested M13mp9 vector Messing BR Vieira, 1982 , previously treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to prevent its circularization.Tne libation mixtures were used to transform competent E. coli JM101 and recombinants were selected as clear plaques by insertional inactivation of the ss galactosidase gene Messing Et a3, 1981 . Single stranded DNA was prepared by standard Winter Fields, 1980 and the inserts were sequence using a universal 17 nucleotide long primer Duckworth et al,1981 .Preparation of bacterial extracts Bacteria carrying recombinant plasmids were grown at 30 C for 2 h and expression of the cro ss galactosidase fusion protein induced by shifting to 42 C for 2h. Bacteria were pelleted at 1200 g and washed with 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.4, 170 mM NaCI. Cells were resuspended in the same buffer containing lysozyme 2.5 mg ml and sonicated lor 2 man on ice. The lysate was centrifugea at 45,000 g for 30 at 40C. The pellet was resuspended in 7 M urea in 10 mM Tris HC1, pH 7.4, lmM EDTA and incubated at room temperature for 30 min.The solubilised extract was dialysed extensively against 50 mM Tris HC1 pH 7.4 at 40C, and then centrifugea at 45,000 g for 30 min at 40C.Gelatin Sepharose chromatography Gelatin Sepharose was either obtained from SigmaChemicals St. Louis, MO, USA or prepared by linking gclatii pig skin type 1, Stigma Chemicals to CNBr activatedSepharose CL.4B Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden . Chromatogr pr. of bacterial extracts on gelatin Sepharose was carried out as described by Ruoslahti et al 1982 . The efficacy of the gelatin Sepharose matrix was verified using purified hurran plasma fibronectin Sigma Chemicals .Electrophoretic analysis SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out in 0.1 w v SDS in Tris glycine buffer on 7.5E w v acrylamide slab gels 19 . Gels were stained with 0.1E Coomassie blue in methanol water acetic acid 4 5 1 by vol. .Immunoblotting was performed as described by Towbin et al. 1979 . Polypeptides, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose were probed with rabbit anti human plasma fibronectin serum 1 500 in phosphate buffered saline, 10E newborn calf serum and 0.05 Tween 20 . Bound immunoglobulin was visualised using alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti rabbit IgG 1 1000 Sigma Chemicals . Protein assay Protein was estimated by the method of Bradford 1976 using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Construction and characterisation of fibronectin expression plasirdds The human fibronectin cDNA clones, pFHl34 and pFH16, encompass all or part of the collagen binding domain of fibronectin identified by proteolytic cleavage of the protein see Fig. 1 and Fig. 5 . These cDRAs were therefore chosen as the starting point for investigating the expression of a functional collagen binding site in E. coli. The pEX vectors used for cloning enable exogenous gene sequences to be inserted into a polylinker in all three reading frames at the 3 end of a cro LacZ hybrid gene under the control of thc Pr promoter Stanley t al, 1984 .The 5 ends of t 1.74 kb and 1.04 kb inserts of pFH134 and pFH16 respectively were sequenced Maxam et al, 1980 to establish the reading frames of the cDNAs and blunt end cloned into the Smal site of pEX2. The recombinant plasmids were introduced into an E. coli strain previously transformed with a plasmid encodlng the temperature sensitive Pr repressor, c1857.This allows for temperature inducible expression of the cro ss galactosidase protein. To test fr the production of fibronectin fusion protein t the expression constructs, hybridisation positive clones were grown at 30 C for 2 h and then shifted to 42 C for a further 2 h. Total bacterial lysates were analysed by SDt polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Five of ten pXFH134 constructs and one of seer. pXFH16 constructs showed tnt production of high molecular weight polypeptides of sic.c consistent with the lengths of the cDNA inserts 185 kD and 165 kD respectively.The correct orientation of th fibronectin sequences in pXFH134 and pXFH16 was confirmed by restriction enzyme analyses. The fusion proteins produced by pXFH134 and pXFH16 accounted for approximately 20 of the total bacterial protein consistent with the previous report for this vector system Stanley et al, 1Y84 . Both fusion proteins showed some proteolytic degradation, particularly the pXFH134 polypeptide, which appeared to be partially cleaved to the size of the wild type cro ss galactosidase 116 kD . Analysis of proteins synthesised over a time course of induction 0 to 120 min indicated that proteolysis occurrca concomitantly with synthesis of the fusion proteins. The expression of fibronectin antigenic determinants in pXFH134 and pXFH16 was investigated by immunoblotting using a rabbit polyclonal anti human plasma fibronectin serum. The antiserum reacted with the 185 kD polypeptide synthesised by pXFH134 but not with the pXFH16 fusion protein or the cro ss galactosidase polypeptide, indicating that the epitope s recognised by the anti serum lie outside the type II homology units and adjacent type I repeats Fig. 5 . This observation is consistent with the poor antigenicity of the collagen binding domain of human fibronectin previously reported Ruoslahti et al, 1979 and most probably reflects the very high level of amino acid conservation in this region Fig. 2 . Gelatin Sepharose affinity chromatoqraphy Over production of ss galactosidase fusions in E.coli results in the precipitation of the protein in the cells as insoluble inclusion bodies Williams et al, 1982, Cheng 1983,Stanley 1983 . Thus, when bacteria expressing the pXFH134 plasmid were lysed by sonication and centrifuged, the fibronectin fusion protein was found exclusively in the insoluble pellet. This fraction represented approximately 50t of the total protein of the bacterial lysate. Solubilisation of this material required treatment with 7 M urea and, following dialysis, 60e of the protein remained in solution.This fraction, which was highly enriched in the fusion protein, was applied directly to a 5 ml gelatin Sepharose column equilibrated in 50 mM Tris HC1, pH 7.4. The column was washed with 0.5 M NaCl in 50 mM Tris HC1, pH 7.4 until the E280 of the flowthrough was c0.01. The cro I3galactosidas fibronectin hybrid protein was eluted from the column as a single symmetrical peak with 4 M urea in the same buffer.Under these conditions fibronectin is specifically released from gelatin Sepharose Ruoslahti et al, 1982 . In the control experiment using pEX2 only, no binding of the wildtype cro ss galactosidase protein was observed. A functional collagen binding site has therefore been reconstituted in the pXFH134 fusion protein. It must bc noted, however, that the fusion protein specifically eluted from the column represented 5 of the fusion protein applied to the column. Thus, not surprisingly, considerable activity is lost due to the insolubilisation of the fusion proteins in the bacterial cells, and subsequent vigorous treatment required to resolubilise them. The fibronectin fusion protein produced by pXFH16 was also tested for gelatin binding and showed similar activity to pXFH134. This indicated that the collagen binding region occurred within the domain defined at the protein level and strongly implicated the two type II and adjacent type I homology units see Fig. 5 . To further localise the binding site, a series of overlapping expression constructs was made from pFH16 Fig. 5 and systematically assayed for gelatinbinding activity. The results are summarised in Table 1, ad show the consistent involvement of the type II homology units pXFN 2, 3 and 6 . Table 1 pEX construct Binding to Gelatin Sepharose pXFH134 pXFH16 pXFNl 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 pEX2 vector only The binding activity of pXFH134 is almost entirely accounted for by a construct consisting of the two type II homology units pXFN3 . By comparing the gelatin binding activity of pXFN3 and pXFN6 both active with pXFN5 and pXFN8 both inactive , it may be deduced that the amino acid sequence critical for binding lies in the C terminal half of the fibronectin fragment in pXFN3, and more particularly from the Hinfl site coordinate 1147 of Figure 3 to the Rsal site coordinate 1351 of Figure 3 . This 66 amino acid sequence represents almost the entire second type II homology unit of fibronectin plus a few amino acids of the adjacent type I homology unit see Fig. 2 .ReferencesAnson, D., Choo, K.H., Rees, D.J.G., Giannelli, F., Gould, K., Huddleston, J.A. and Brcwnlee, G.G. 1984 EMBO J. 3, 1053 1064.Bradford M. 1976 , Anal.
