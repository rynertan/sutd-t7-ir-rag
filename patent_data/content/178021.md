## Abstract
A device for exposing an edge zone of a photoconductive element to light, comprising a light source 19, 20 and a movable screen 11, 12 by means of which the width of the edge zone 3 to be exposed to light can be adjusted. The light source 19, 20 is fixed to the movable screen 11, 12 and is movable therewith. Preferably the screen consists of a pivotable housing in which the light source is mounted in an area defined by two planes which interest along the bottom edge of the innermost side wall of the housing, and include an angle of 15 , the plane through the pivot line 14 of the housing and the bottom edge of the innermost side wall of the housing being the bisector plane.
