# A COIN SORTING MACHINE

## Abstract
In accordance with the invention a coin sorter is provided which sorts mixed denominations of coins. The coin sorter comprises a rotatable disc 10 having a resilient surface 27 and a stationary disc 16 having its first surface positoned proximate to the resilient surface 27 of the rotatable disc 10 . The two discs 10,16 are positioned sufficiently close such that coins placed between the two disc surfaces are pressed into the resilient surface 27 by pressure from the stationary disc 16 surface. Accordingly, coins cannot move on the rotatable disc 10 and, as a result, they rotate with the rotatable disc 10 . Radial movement of the coins is urged by centrifugal force from the coin rotation, but such movement is prevented by the coins pressed engagement with the resilient surface. Selected areas of the stationary disc 16 are recessed so as to release coins from their pressed engagement with the resilient surface and thereby allow radial movement of the released coins in response to centrifugal force. The selected areas of the stationary disc which are recessed, guide the coins along a path 40,46,50,52,54,56 which results in each denomination of coin escaping from between the two discs 10,16 at different positions 50,52,54,56 along the periphery of the stationary disc 16 . A means 47 is provided to remove the upper coin from stacked or shingled coin combinations. Particularly, the means 44 may be an arcuate elastomer member which retards movement of the upper coin while allowing the other coin to rotate freely. Alternatively, the means may be a recess in the stationary disc entrance allows only single layer coins to enter the recess by sweeping the surface of the lower coin and recirculating any stacked and shingled coins removed thereby. Recesses and ridges 42 are provided on the underside of the stationary disc 16 which recirculate improperly aligned coins. In particular, a ridge 47 is provided which recirculates misaligned coins to a recessed area which initially receives coins from the center opening of the stationary disc 16 . A portion of the recesses in the stationary disc 16 which guide correctly aligned coins are configured to be approximately equal to the largest diameter coin in order to facilitate correct coin alignment. Another portion of the recesses provide an ejection route for misaligned coins which leads the coins back to the recessed area which initially accepts coins into the area between the two discs 10,16 . Yet another portion of the recesses in the stationary disc 16 allow the smallest diameter coin denomi nation smooth and quick release between the two discs 10,16 .
