# Method and apparatus for detecting a dead zone in the transfer function of a signal processing system.

## Abstract
A dead zone in the transfer function of a signal processing system, such as a VTR, is detected by impressing on the sys tem a test signal that is formed within a predetermined interval from a sinusoidal waveform modulated by an envelope func tion that reduces to zero at a predetermined time. The exist ence of the dead zone is detected by observing whether the corresponding output signal of the signal processing system has a constant amplitude at times other than the time at which the envelope function is zero.
