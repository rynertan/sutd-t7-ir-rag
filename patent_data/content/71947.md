# Method and apparatus for reducing vibrations of stationary induction apparatus.

## Abstract
Disclosed are a method and an apparatus for re ducing vibrations generated in a stationary induction apparatus 1 by detecting the vibration and by applying a vibration applying force capable of suppressing the detected vibrations to the stationary induction appara tus by at least one vibration applying device 4a to 4f , in which the phase and amplitude of the vibration applying force of the vibration applying device are successively and reparatedly adjusted so as to decrease the sum of squares of the respective amplitudes of vibration detected by the vibration sensors. A calcula tion for obtaining the sum of squares of the detected amplitudes of vibration and the control of the phase and amplitude of the vibration applying force based upon the calculated sum of squares may be carried out in accordance with a programm stored in a microcom puter.
