# A virtual storage data processing system.

## Abstract
A virtual storage data processing system having an address translation unit 75 shared by a plurality of proces sors, located in a memory control unit 12 connected to a main memory 10 is disclosed. One of the plurality of processors is a job processor 40 which accesses the main memory with a virtual address to execute an instruction and includes a cache memory 41, 42 which is accessed with a virtual address. One of the plurality of processors is a file processor 22 which accesses the main memory with a virtual address to transfer data between the main memory and an external memory 20 . The cache memory receives the virtual address when the file processor writes to the main memory and if it contains a data block corresponding to the virtual address, it invalidates the corresponding data block. The address translation unit translates the address different ly for the access from the file processor and the accesses from other processors.
