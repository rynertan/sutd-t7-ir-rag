# Cathode coating with hydrogen evolution catalyst and semi conducting polymer.

## Abstract
A cathode coating comprises a catalyst for hydrogen evolution finely dispersed in a matrix consisting of an insoluble, semiconducting polymer which is formed in situ on an electrode support body. A bipolar electrode is provided with such a cathode coating on a support body consisting of a valve metal such as titanium. The cathode coating is formed by applying to the electrode support body a coating solution which contains an inorganic precursor compound for the hydrogen evolution catalyst and an organic precursor compound for forming the polymer matrix, drying and then thermally converting these precursors to a cathode coating adhering to the electrode support body.
