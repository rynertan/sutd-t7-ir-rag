# ARRANGEMENT FOR ALIGNING AND SUPPLYING FLAT PRISMATIC ARTICLES

## Abstract
An arrangement for aligning and supplying flat prismatic articles, such as tape cassettes or parts thereof, which arrangement comprises a rotatable drum which is included with its axis in horizontal position in a frame and has at least at one side an at least partly open end face, as a result of which the articles to be aligned can be supplied to the lowermost part of the drum, the inner wall of the drum being provided with a number of substantially radially extending partition walls in the form of an angle profile, which upon rotation take along a number of articles from the lowermost drum part to the uppermost drum part, where the articles fall onto a further transport device, characterized in that the angle profiles, viewed in the direction of the circumference of the drum, are arranged at equal relative distances which are slightly larger than a dimension of the articles, the height of the angle profiles being slightly larger than the thickness of the articles, while the inner wall of the drum is further provided with a number of separation walls arranged at equal relative distances corresponding to the width of the articles in planes at right angles to the axis so that a number of rows of compartments for the articles is formed, each of the compartments comprising an ejector engaging the relevant angle profile and means being further provided with the aid of which, when the relevant angle profile is located substantially at the highest point of the drum, the ejectors of the relevant compartment are all moved away from the relevant angle profile so that the articles present in the compartments are ejected therefrom and fall onto the further transport device arranged beneath them.
