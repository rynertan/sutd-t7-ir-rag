## Abstract
A metnod is provided for recording data on a video tape recorder 504 which comprises the steps of a Feeding incoming data into a buffer store 200 , b Transferring a file of data from the buffer store 200 on to a stripe of a video tape mounted on the video recorder 504 , c Repeating steps a and b until a block of files has been recorded on a plurality of stripes contained in a length of tape, adjacent recorded stripes being separated from one another by unrecorded stripes if the rate at which the data is fed to the store is less than the maximum rate at which data can be recorded, d Where steps a to c leave unrecorded stripes in the said length of tape, repeating steps a to c to record data on previously unrecorded stripes, and e Repeating steps a to d on successive lengths of tape. An apparatus for carrying out this recording and for read ing the recorded data is also disclosed. The method and apparatus are applicable, inter alia, to re ceiving image data received from satellites.
