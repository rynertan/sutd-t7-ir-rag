# Making metal strip and slab from spray.

## Abstract
In a process for making metal strip 7, a spray 9, 10 of molten metal is directed towards a nip 13 formed by two smooth cooled rolls 6, the rolls being rotated so that the nip hot compacts the sprayed metal to yield a strip emerging from the exit of the nip. Splats formed by droplets of the molten spray impinging on the rolls 6 before reaching the nip 13 do not stick completely to the roll surfaces but at least partially detach themselves on freezing and form a new surface on which subsequent droplets of the spray land when the nip is reached, the partially detached frozen droplets and their overlying deposit, on both rolls, are compacted hot.
