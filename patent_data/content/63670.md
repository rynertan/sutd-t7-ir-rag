# DEVICE FOR AUTOMATIC SHUT OFF AND SUPPORT OF BLOW DRYERS

## Abstract
Device for automatic shut off and support of blow dryers made of electrically insulating plastic material, consisting of rectangular or other shaped plate, equipped with rear hooks or the like to be fixed to the belt or to any other support, made to form the rear closing of a container with a ring or strip on the front face shaped as a circle or in general as the body of a blow dryer. Said strip is hinged in correspondence with the upper part of an opening in said container, so that when downwards pressure is exerted due to the weight of the blow dryer itself, it acts on a switch, preferably a micro switch, placed in said container and connected to a socket where the power supply plug for the blow dryer is inserted, so that the electricity is interrupted when the circuit drawing current from the network is opened.
