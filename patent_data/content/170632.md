# Process for the cathodic electrowinning of metals, with the corresponding acid generation, from their salt solutions.

## Abstract
A procedure for the cathodic electrowinning of metals, with the corresponding acid generation, from its salt solution, using a electrochemical cell where the anodic and cathodic comparments are physically separated by a cation permoselective membrane, in such a way that different electrolytes are used in each electrodic space. The cathode receives a solution of the corresponding metallic salt, typically, its chloride , the metal being discharged at the cathode, and the electrical equilibrium being maintained by protons coming from the anolyte, across the cations permeating membrane.
