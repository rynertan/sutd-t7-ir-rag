# Confusion grouping of strokes in pattern recognition method and system.

## Abstract
A method and system for recognizing complex patterns, such as Chinese characters Kanji , which may employ detailed information about an element and specifically curvature characteristics. Selected elements or strokes are grouped into confusion groups. Strokes under examination are categorized and assigned either stroke identity labels or confusion group identity labels by a flexible compartson of distance metrics generated with reference to templates which represent general recognition criteria or groupings of specific strokes. Specific threshold criteria are applied to distance metrics.
