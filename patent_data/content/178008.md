## Description
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of catalysts comprising cobalt supported on acarrier. The preparation of hydrocarbons from a H EP A 174,696 which was not published at the priority date of the present invention but claims anearlier priority, describes an investigation into the use of catalysts comprising cobalt supported on a carrierfor the preparation of hydrocarbons from H Further investigation has shown that the catalysts have higher C 5 selectivities according as their The present patent application relates to a process for the preparation of such catalysts by immersing aporous carrier once or several times in a solution of a cobalt compound, removing the liquid from thecompositionfollowed by calciningafter each immersion and activating the composition. It has been foundthat the quotient The present patent application therefore provides a process for the preparation of catalysts comprisingcobalt supported on a carrier, in which catalysts the cobalt is distributed over the carrier in such a manneras to satisfy the relation In the process according to the invention the porous carrier should be immersed once or several timesin a solution of a cobalt compound. Suitable for the purpose are both solutions of cobalt compounds inwater, to which optionally a thickener, such as hydroxyethylcellulose, may be added, and solutions ofcobalt compounds in organic solvents, such as ethanol or glycol. The catalysts prepared according to the invention contain cobalt supported on a porous carrier. Verysuitable carriers are, inter alia, silica, alumina and silica alumina. Preference is given to the use of silica ascarrier. The quantities of cobalt present on the catalysts may vary within wide ranges. Preference is given tothe preparation of catalysts comprising 3 60, and in particular 5 50, parts by weight of cobalt per 100parts by weight of carrier material. The catalyst prepared according to the invention preferably includeone or more promoters. Suitable promoters for the present cobalt catalysts are iron, magnesium, zinc andthorium. It is preferred to prepare catalysts which include zirconium, titanium, chromium or ruthenium aspromoter. Special preferance is given to the use of zirconium as promoter. The preferred quantities ofpromoter present in the cobalt catalysts are dependent on the way in which the promoter has beendeposited. In the case of catalysts in the preparation of which the cobalt was deposited on the carrier first,and the promoter next, preference is given to catalysts comprising 0.1 5 parts by weight of the promoterper 100 parts by weight of carrier. In the case of catalysts in the preparation of which the promoter wasdeposited on the carrier first, and the cobalt next, preference is given to catalysts comprising 5 40 parts byweight of the promoter per 100 parts by weight of carrier. A correct inhomogeneous distribution of the cobalt over the carrier is essential to the catalystsaccording to the invention. If, in addition to cobalt, the catalyst includes a promoter, such as zirconium, thelatter may be distributed over the carrier either homogeneously or inhomogeneously. Homogeneousdistribution of the promoter will occur when the promoter is deposited on the carrier by way ofconventional impregnation, either preceding or following the deposition of the cobalt on the carrier.Inhomogeneous distribution of the promoter may occur when the cobalt and the promoter are depositedsimultaneously by immersing the porous carrier in a solution comprising both a cobalt compound and acompound of the promoter. The catalysts prepared according to theinventioncan be used for the conversion of H The conversion of a H H The H The conversion of the H Although in the preparation of middle distillates from the product obtained over the cobalt catalyst thepart of the product whose initial boiling point lies above the final boiling point of the heaviest middledistillate desired as end product will do as feed for the hydrocracking, the total C 5 fraction of the productprepared over the cobalt catalyst may also be used for the purpose, if desired. The hydrocracking is carried out by contacting the fraction to be treated at elevated temperature andpressure and in the presence of hydrogen with a catalyst comprising one or more Group VIII noble metalson a carrier. The hydrocracking catalyst used by preference is a catalyst comprising 0.2 1 w of platinumor palladium supported on silica alumina as carrier. The hydrocracking treatment is preferably carried outat a temperature of 250 350 C and a pressure of 10 75 bar. The invention is now illustrated with the aid of the following example. Fourteen Co Zr SiO The silica carrier was contacted at a temperature of 20 C for 15 minutes with a solution of cobalt nitratein water. The quantity of solution used was such that its volume corresponded substantially with the porevolume of the carrier. The solution had a viscosity, measured at 60 C, of 1.7 cS. After drying and calcining at500 C the cobalt loaded carrier was kept in contact with a solution of zirconium nitrate in water. Again, thequantity of solution used was of such a volume as to correspond substantially with the pore volume of thecarrier. Finally the cobalt and zirconium loaded carrier was dried and calcined at 500 C. The silica carrier was kept immersed in water of 20 C for 30 minutes. After drip drying thewater saturated carrier was immersed three times each time for 30 seconds at a temperature of 20 C inthe same solution of cobalt nitrate in water as was used in the preparation of catalyst 1. After eachimmersion the material was dried and calcined at 500 C. Subsequently, zirconium was deposited on thecobalt loaded carrier in a way identical to that described for the preparation of catalyst 1. This catalyst was prepared in substantially the same way as catalyst 2, the difference being that in thepresent case four immersions in the cobalt nitrate solution were performed. These catalysts were prepared by immersing the silica carrier once or several times each time for tseconds in a solution of cobalt nitrate in a solvent. After each immersion the material was dried and calcined at 500 C. Subsequently zirconium was deposited on the cobalt loaded carriers in a way identical tothat described for the preparation of catalyst 1.
