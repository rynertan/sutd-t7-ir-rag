# Improved curtain.

## Abstract
Conventionally, shower and like curtains are provided with suspension holes which are reinforced by metal eyelets. In order to avod the use of metal eyelets and provide a cheaper mode of forming reinforced holes in curtains, two layers of the curtain material are ultrasonically welded together over a configuration 13 arranged to circumscribe the intended position of the hole 12. The reinforcement of the hole is formed by integrating the material and the metal eyelets are no longer necessary. Particularly if the curtain material is not weldable, a layer or insert of thermoplastic material is inserted between the layer of curtain material.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A method of forming a reinforced hole in a curtain of weldable plastics material such as nylon, characterised in that two layers 4 of the curtain material are ultrasonically welded together over a configuration circumscribing the position of the required hole 3 , and the hole 3 is cut and sealed in the area so circumscribed. 2. A method according to claim 1, characterised in that a reinforcing layer 5 or insert of thermoplastic material is welded to the layers 4 of curtain material as they are welded together. 3. A method of forming a reinforced hole in a curtain on non weldable material, characterised in that a strip or insert 5 of weldable thermoplastic material is located between two layers 4 of the curtain material and ultrasonically welded so as to diffuse into the curtain material of both layers 4 to hold them together over a configuration circumscribing the position of the required hole 3 , and the hole 3 is cut and sealed in the area so circumscribed. 4. A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that the configuration of the ultrasonic welding is a series of areas 13 arranged in a circle centred on the required hole 3 . 5. A method according to claim 4, in which the areas are circular. 6. A curtain, particularly a shower curtain of nylon or other material, having suspension holes formed by a method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5.

## Description
Title IMPROVED CURTAIN This invention relates to curtains, and more particularly shower curtains, which are provided adjacent one edge with one or more holes for suspension of the curtain from a suitable rod or other suspension system, e.g. by receiving snap in curtain rings.Such holes have to date been high frequency welded in weldable materials or punched and reinforced with metal eyelets in non weldable materials. The curtain may or may not have an insert strip, e.g.of polyvinyl chloride, positioned in the top edge of the curtain.In order to form and reinforce the suspension holes, the holes are punched through two thicknesses of nylon curtain and the insert strip. A one or two part metal eyelet is then pneumatically fitted through the hole. A section through a typical hole will then have as successive layers metal eyelets, curtain material, strip material, curtain material, metal eyelet.In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of forming a reinforced hole in a curtain of weldable plastics material such as nylon, in which two layers of the curtain material are ultrasonically welded together over a configuration circumscribing the position of the required hole, and the hole is cut and sealed in the area so circumscribed. A reinforcing layer or insert of thermoplastic material may be welded to the layers of curtain material as they are welded together.According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a method of forming a reinforced hole in the curtain of non weldable material, in which a strip or insert of weldable thermoplastic material is located between two layers of the curtain material and ultrasonically welded so as to diffuse into the curtain material of both layers to hold them together over a configuration circumscribing the position of the required hole,and the hole is cut and sealed in the area so circumscribed.The use of metal eyelets is thus avoided and the reinforcement of the hole provided by the welding together of the two sheets of the curtain material or by diffusion of the insert strip material into the curtain material.It is preferred that the configuration of the ultrasonic welding is a series of areas arranged in a circle concentric with the required hole, and the said areas themselves may be circular in shape.The invention also comprehends a curtain, particularly a shower curtain, having suspension holes formed by a method according to the invention as set forth above.The invention will be further described with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which Figure 1 is an elevation, partially cut away, of a shower curtain to which the invention may be applied Figure 2 is a section through the upper portion of the curtain prior to formation of reinforced holes Figure 3 is a diagrammatic sectional view taken on the line Ill Ill of Figure 4 showing the structure of Figure 2 submitted to ultrasonic welding Figure 4 is a plan view of parts of the structure shown in Figure 3 Figures 5 and 6 show alternative welding patterns andFigure 7 is an elevation showing a further typical pattern of ultrasonic welding around a reinforced hole formed in accordance with the invention.A shower curtain normally consists of a sheet of material for example a nylon fabric which is weldable, but non weldable materials may also be used. A lower edge may be turned over to enclose a leaded weight strip so as to form a bead 1 at the lower edge of the curtain as shown in Figure 1. The upper edge of the curtain is also turned back and sewn or welded to the main body of the curtain along a line indicated at 2. A reinforcing strip or piece of polyvinyl chloride or similar material is normally sewn or welded in to reinforce this upper edge. Holes 3 are formed along the upper edge to receive curtain rings to suspend the curtain from a suitable rod or other suspension system, and these holes are normally reinforced by metal eyelets applied after punching.Figure 2 shows two layers 4 of the curtain material with a layer 5 of the thermoplastic reinforcement material between them.In accordance with the invention, the reinforcement is provided by ultrasonically welding together the two sheets 4 of curtain material. If the curtain material is weldable they may be directly welded together, i.e. without a layer or strip 5, and if this is provided it is welded to both sheets. If the curtain material is non weldable, the sheet or strip 5 is caused to diffuse into both layers 4 of curtain material to form an effective weld.The welding is achieved over a suitable pattern surrounding the intended position of the hole, and Figures 3 and 4 show an anvil 8, a plinth 6 and an ultrasonic horn 7 of an ultrasonic welding machine. The horn 7 is preferably of titanium. The metal, usually steel, anvil 8 is mounted on the plinth 6 and carries a raised pattern 9 against which a flat face 10, formed on a brass button 10a of the horn 7, presses the laminate of sheets 4 and 5 to form the required weld. A knife blade 15 is provided in the centre of the anvil 8 to cut and seal the hole simultaneously with the formation of the weld. The anvil 8 is shown as secured to the plinth 6 by clamps 66.Figure 4 shows a typical pattern of welding to form a reinforced hole. The raised pattern 9 is in the form of a series of circular pips arranged in a ring concentric with the knife blade 15. InFigure 4, the hole itself as formed by the knife blade 15 is shown at 12 and it can be seen that it is surrounded by a pattern of welded areas 13. If formed by the pattern 9, the welded areas would each be circular and with their centres arranged on a circle concentric with the circular hole 12. As shown, the welded areas are part annular to illustrate a possible modification. Other alternative form of weld pattern are shown in Figures 5 and 6.By using ultrasonic welding to form the reinforced holes, rather than eyeletted holes, it will be seen that the use of metal eyelets is avoided, and also therefore the necessity of placing the eyelets, in the machines either manually or otherwise. Accordingly the process of production is less labour intensive and faster and cheaper than the conventional process. Various modifications may be made within the scope of the invention.For example, a raised pattern may be formed on the button 10a instead of or additionally to the pattern 9 on the anvil 8. Also the central hole 12 need not be circular, nor need the pattern of welds be arranged in a circle around the central hole.In addition in order to emphasise the reinforced holes, to make an aesthetic feature, the welded areas may be coloured, for example by introducing a coloured tape between the ultrasonic horn or face 10 and the material 4.
