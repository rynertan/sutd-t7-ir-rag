## Description
TITLE FLAME RETARDANT THERMOPLASTIC POLYESTER MOLDING COMPOSITION DESCRIPTIONTechnical Field This invention relates to certain flame retardant thermoplastic polyester molding compositions, such as those based on polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, and copolymers and mixtures thereof, which compositions are characterized by improved thermal stability, better color, higher heat deflection temperature and no blooming . Flame retardant additives for polyester molding compositions have included a combination of a halogenated organic compound, such as brominated polystyrene, and a synergist, e.g. antimony oxide and certain metal antimonates, which achieve the desired degree of flame retardancy at a lower level of the halogenated organic compound. However, for certain polyester molding compositions, where the required processing temperatures are high, the choice of the halogenated organic compound is limited by the thermal stability of such halogenated compound. The need exists for compositions that have excellent flame retardant properties, but which also have improved thermal stability, better color,. higher heat deflection temperature and do not bloom.Background Art U.S. Patent 4,338,243, granted July 6, 1982 to Hecht et al discloses flame retardant polyethylene terephthalate molding compositions containing a halogenated organic compound, such as brominted polystyrene, and a metal antimonate as the fire retardant additives. U.S. Patent 3,354,191, granted November 21, 1967 to Stivers discloses various tetrabromophthalate salts, including the dipotassium salt, and their use as flame retardant additives for flammable polymeric materials, such as polyethylene. The aluminum salt is considered superior and is the only salt claimed. U.S. Patent 3,285,995, granted November 15, 1966 to Nametz et al discloses the use of purified tetrabromophthalic anhydride as a flame retardant additive for polyester resins, including polyethylene terephthalate. Nametz purifies the anhydride by forming the soluble sodium salt, but precipitates the anhydride with hydrochloric acid and uses the insoluble anhydride, rather than the sodium salt as the flame retardant additive. None of the references discussed above disclose the use of a Group I metal salt of, tetrabromo or tetrachloro phthalic anhydride in polyethylene terephthalate molding compositions, or that such use results in a molding resin having excellent fire retardant properties and improved thermal stability, better color, higher heat distortion temperatures and no blooming.Disclosure of the Invention This invention relates to certain flame retardant thermoplastic polyester molding compositions which are characterized by improved thermal stability, better color, higher heat deflection temperature and no blooming. It has been found that certain halogenated organic salts can be blended with conventional polyester molding compositions and impart to such compositions excellent fire retardant properties and also cause surprising improvements in other properties of the molding composition as compared with known commercially available flame retardant additives for polyester molding compositions and also as compared with other known materials which are chemically similar to the halogenated organic compounds used in the compositions of the present invention, and which other known materials are also known to be generally useful as flame retardants in flammable polymers. More specifically, it has been found thatGroup I metal salts of a tetrahalophthalic acid, where the halogen is bromine or chlorine, can be used in thermoplastic polyester molding compositions to impart excellent flame retardant properties to such compositions and also to impart improved thermal stability, better color, higher heat deflection temperarure and no blooming to such compositions.This is particularly surprising because known fire retardants are chemically quite similar and do not have these effects on polyester molding compositions, and because Group I salts of tetrabromophthalic anhydride have been used as fire retardants in polyethylene and this combination of unexpected properties was not observed in such compositions in fact the Group I salts were judged to be inferior . The term polyester as used herein includes polymers which are, in general, linear saturated condensation products of glycols and dicarboxylic acids, or reactive derivatives thereof. Preferably, they will comprise condensation products of aromatic dicarboxylic acids having 8 to 14 carbon atoms and at least one glycol selected from the group consisting of neopentyl glycol, cyclohexane dimethanol and aliphatic glycols of the formula HO CH2 nOH where n is an integer of 2 to 10. Up to 50 mole percent of the aromatic dicarboxylic acids can be replaced by at least one different aromatic dicarboxylic acid having from 8 to 14 carbon atoms, and or up to 20 mole percent can be replaced by an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms.

The compositions of the present invention can contain up to 15 weight percent of an antimony salt, preferably 0.5 10.0 weight percent, and most preferably 1.5 4.0 weight percent. If no antimony salt is used, or if only a small amount of antimony salt is used, the quantity of the metal salt of the tetrahalophthalic acid needed to give a particular level of fire retardency must be increased accordingly. The antimony salt will be an antimonate of metals of Groups I, II or VIII. Representative antimonates include sodium, potassium, zinc and nickel antimonate, and mixtures thereof. Sodium antimonate is preferred. The antimonate will preferably be used in particulate or powder form.

To find the tHH AHct , polyethylene terephthalate is molded at a mold temperature of 700C into 1 16 thick bars.The bars are heated at a rate of 100C per minute and between 950C and 1200C an exotherm termed dHH is recorded on a differential scanning calorimeter DSC cell attached to a Du Pont Differential ThermalAnalysis DTA device. The bar is heated to 2900 which is above its melting point and the melted sample cooled at 10 C minute. Another exotherm between about 200 2250C termed AH is recorded on c freezing of the sample.

In addition to the components discussed hereinabove, the compositions of this invention may contain additives commonly used with polyester resins, such as colorants, mold release agents, antioxidants, tougheners, nucleating agents, ultraviolet light and heat stabilizers and the like. The compositions of this invention are prepared by blending the components together by any convenient means to obtain an intimate blend.Neither temperature nor pressure are critical. For example, the polyethylene terephthalate can be mixed dry in any suitable blender or tumbler with the other components and the mixture melt extruded. The extrudate can be chopped.

All parts and percentages are by weight, and all temperatures are in degrees Celsius unless otherwise specified. Measurements not originally in SI units have been so converted and rounded where appropriate. In the following examples, tensile strength and elongation were measured on injection molded bars by ASTM Method D 638. Test bars were 1 8 0.32 cm ASTM D 638 Type I bars. Unnotched impact strength was measured by cutting 5 x 1 2 x 1 8 inch 12.7 x 1.27 x 0.32 cm injection molded bars to the size specified for the Izod test in ASTM Method D256, but without notching the bars, and otherwise running the test byIzod method ASTH D256. Flame retardancy was measured by Unuerwriter s Laboratory Method UL 94. Thermal stability, as indicated by a change in viscosity over time at elevated temperature was measured as the viscosity at a shear stress of 125 kPa using aMonsanto Automatic Capillary Rheometer.

Blooming was evaluated by placing molded flex bars in an air oven at l500C for 16 hours. The bars were then removed and cooled at room temperature. Blooming was considered to have occurred when the surface, which was originally glossy and free of any deposits, was observed to be dull and when a deposit could be detected by ruDbing onets finger over the surface. Color was measured subjectively by visual comparison. Color differences observed in these experiments could also be measured by a HunterLabColor Difference Meter. The heat deflection temperature was determined by ASTH D 648 at 264 p.s.i. 1.8 MPa . Example 1 Preparation of Metal Salts of Tetrabromophthalic Anhydride a Sodium tetrabromophthalate was prepared by adding 981 grams of tetrabromophthalic anhydride to 4,400 grams of water in a stirred beaker, heating to 600C, and then adding 167 grams of sodium hydroxide.
