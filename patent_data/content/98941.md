# Method of making ohmic contacts regions and device manufactured by the method.

## Abstract
In a method of forming electrodes or wiring structures in a semiconductor device, metal and metal silicide are used for electrodes and lead wires, impurities 6 are doped into the interface of a semiconductor substrate 1 from the surface by gas diffusion or solid diffusion irrespective of the thickness, and in the case where the base material is an insulating material, the impurities are not doped into the semiconductor region side by self alignement.
