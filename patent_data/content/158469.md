# Apparatus and method for applying material to articles.

## Abstract
Apparatus and a method for applying material to articles is disclosed. Two paint spray guns 2 are mounted on a common manifold block 14 by means of which trigger air, atomising air and paint are fed to the guns. Each spray gun 2 is in dividually controlled by a respective solenoid valve 28 also supported on the manifold block. The apparatus is mounted on a robot arm 52 and is manoeuvred thereby to undertake a painting operation. Dur ing each stage of the painting operation a selected one of the spray guns is positioned adjacent a surface to be painted and then operated to apply paint. The painting operation can be performed very quickly as the movements required of the robot are simpler and therefore faster than those of a con ventional painting robot having just a single spray gun.
