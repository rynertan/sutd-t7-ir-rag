## Description
RARE EARTH CONTAINING MAGNETS This invention relates to methods for producing rare earth containing permanent magnets, and to compositions for use in the methods. Permanent magnets, defined as materials which exhibit permanent ferromagnetism the ability to maintain magnetism following removal from a magnetizing field , have long been useful industrial materials, finding extensive applications in such devices as meters, loudspeakers, motors, and generators. The more thoroughly developed permanent magnet compositions, for applications requiring the highest available residual magnetic strength, are alloys which contain rare earths and the ferromagnetic metals. Alloys of samarium and cobalt, sometimes containing minor amounts of other metals such as iron, manganese, chromium, vanadium, aluminum, and copper disclosed by Menth et al. in U.S. Patent 4,131,495 , have found considerable commercial success. A typical commercial samarium cobalt magnet has the nominal empirical composition Smog, prepared by mixing powderedSmCo5 with a minor amount of samarium cobalt alloy sintering aid which is richer in samarium than SmCo5, aligning the mixture in a magnetic field, pressing the mixture into a desired shape, and sintering the shape.During sintering, the sintering aid becomes at least partially liquid, permitting a large density increase in the shape. This general method is described in U.S.Patent 3,655,464 to Benz. Due to the relatively high cost and scarcity of samarium, it has been found desirable to replace as much of the metal as possible with the more abundant and, consequently, less expensive rare earths, such as praseodymium, lanthanum, cerium, and misch metal.The highest theoretical magnet strengths, for alloys having an atomic ratio of ferromagnetic metal to rare earth of about 5, are obtained with praseodymium cobalt alloys, but these strengths have not yet been obtained in practice. Examples of magnet materials thus produced are shown in U.S. Patent 3,682,714 to Martin, and in references made therein to other patent applications.The patent shows magnets in which praseodymium constitutes 75 percent of the total rare earth content. J. Tsui and S. Strnat, Applied PhysicsLetters, Vol. 18, No. 4, pages 107 108 1971 , describe the preparation of PrCo5 magnets, using liquid phase sintering aids containing either samarium and cobalt or praseodymium and cobalt. Various methods have been used to prepare rare earth containing magnets. Cech, in U.S. Patent 3,625,779, mixes rare earth oxide and calcium hydride, then heats to reduce the oxide and form rare earth metal, which is melted with cobalt. The resulting alloy is then subjected to extensive treatments to remove even traces of formed calcium oxide, and used to produce magnets. In general, it has been desirable to totally exclude oxygen from the rare earth containing magnet production. U.S. Patent 3,723,197 to Brischow et al.gives experimental evidence that Sm203, formed during the production of SmCo5 magnets, is highly detrimental to the magnetic properties of the products. U.S.Patent 4,043,845 to Dionne describes the use of carbon in mixtures of rare earth metal and cobalt, to prevent oxidation of rare earth cobalt alloys. Clegg, in U.S. Patent 4,290,826, discloses a process for producing cobalt rare earth alloys by mixing cobalt powder and refractory oxide powder, adding rare earth metal powder, and heating to form the alloy, without significant sintering. The avoidance of sintering is said to preserve the original small particle sizes, which improves the properties of magnets formed from the product powdered alloy. Unsintered powders, however, must be bound together in resins, etc., to be useful as permanent magnets. The resulting low density of such magnets is reflected in the comparatively low magnetic strengths obtained. Further, the binders contribute to disadvantages such as the inability to use the magnets at elevated temperatures. In addition, sintered magnets have significantly greater mechanical strength. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Compositions for the production of rare earth ferromagnetic metal permanent magnets comprise 1 a major amount of a particulate rare earth ferromagnetic metal alloy 2 a minor amount of a particulate alloy sintering aid which contains rare earth and ferromagnetic metal and 3 about 0.1 to about 2 percent by weight of an additive material selected from the group consisting of refractory oxides, carbides, and nitrides. A method for preparing permanent magnets comprises 1 mixing the rare earth ferromagnetic alloy with t e sintering aid 2 adding to this mixture the additive material 3 aligning the magnetic domains of the mixture in a magnetic field 4 compacting the aligned mixture to form a shape and 5 sintering the compacted shape. In the case of praseodymium cobalt magnets, an improvement in magnetic properties can be obtained even when the additive material is not used, by controlling sintering temperatures in the range about 10200 C.to about 10900 C. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figures lA, 1B, 1C, 1D, and 1E are photomicrographs showing the microstructure of praseodymium cobalt magnets, containing samarium cobalt sintering aid and sintered, respectively, at 11100 C., 11000 C., 10900C., 108at C., and 10700 C.

Figure 3B is a photomicrograph showing the microstructure of a magnet prepared using a praseodymium cobalt base alloy, a samarium cobalt sintering aid, and an additive material for grain growth inhibition. Figure 4 is a graphical representation showing the difference in magnetic properties between the magnets of Figures 3A and 3B. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As used herein, the term rare earth means the lanthanide elements having atomic numbers from 57 to 71, inclusive, and the element yttrium, atomic number 39, which is commonly found in rare earth concentrates and is chemically similar to the rare earths. Ferromagnetic metals, for purposes of this invention, are iron, nickel, cobalt, and numerous alloys containing one or more of these metals. Ferromagnetic metals exhibit the characteristic of magnetic hysteresis, wherein the plots of induction versus applied field strengths from zero to a high positive value, and then to a high negative value and returning to zero are hysteresis loops. Points on the hysteresis loop which are of particular interest for the present invention lie within the second quadrant, or demagnetization curve, since most devices which utilize permanent magnets operate under the influence of a demagnetizing field.On a loop which is symmetrical about the origin, the value of field strength H for which induction B equals zero is called coercive force Hc . This is a measure of the quality of the magnetic material. The value of induction where applied field strength equals zero is called residual induction Br Values of H will be expressed in Oersteds Oe , while values of B will be in Gauss G . A figure of merit for a particular magnet shape is the energy product, obtained by multiplying values of B and H for a given point on the demagnetization curve and expressed in Gauss Oersteds GOe .When any of these unit abbreviations are used, the prefix K indicates multiplication by 103, while M indicates multiplication by 106. When the energy products are plotted against B, one point BHmax is found at the maximum point of the curve this point will also be used herein as a criterion for comparing magnets. Intrinsic coercivity iHc is found where B H equals zero in a plot of B H versus H. The present invention is, in part, directed to the preparation of rare earth ferromagnetic metal compositions, which can be used to fabricate high strength permanent magnets. These compositions comprise mixtures of rare earth ferromagnetic metal alloy powder, usually, but not always, a powdered secondphase sintering aid, and up to about 2 percent by weight of a refractory oxide, carbide, or nitride additive. Rare earth ferromagnetic metal alloys which are useful in the present invention are those which possess ferromagnetic properties. Suitable alloys have been identified in the literature the presently preferred alloys have an empirical formula approximating RM5, wherein R is rare earth metal and M is ferromagnetic metal, as defined herein. Useful magnetic properties are also found in certain RM2, R2N7, R2M17, and other alloys. The invention is exemplified herein by compositions based upon PrCo5 alloys, but it is to be understood that no limitation is intended thereby. Sintering aids are also rare earth ferromagnetic metal alloys, either containing the same metals as do the major phase alloys or different metals.Proportions of the component metals, however, are chosen such that the sintering aid will be at least partially liquid at the chosen sintering temperatures for the magnet. Presently preferred sintering aids are rare earth ferromagnetic metal alloys which contain an excess of rare earth over that required for the formation of RM5 compositions. Sintering aid alloys are present in the mixed magnet coppositions in lesser amounts than the major rare earth ferromagnetic metal alloy phase, about 1 up to about 15 normally about 10 to about 15 percent by weight of the major phase. Thus, sintering aid is considered to be present in a minor amount, as a second phase. Certain magnet base alloys will not require a separately added sintering aid for the practice of the invention. As an example, some compositions do not consist of a single phase, but contain a major phase having good ferromagnetic properties, and minor amounts of one or more lower melting phases. Thus, the magnet alloy can be considered to have its own internal sintering aid, and no external sintering aid phases need be added. In general, any system having an internal, or externally added, lower melting phase, in addition to the magnet base alloy, can benefit from the use of the present invention. Additive materials are particulate refractory oxides, carbides, and nitrides, which have melting points higher than the magnet sintering temperatures, used in amounts about 0.1 percent to about 2 percent by weight of the magnet composition. Suitable oxides include, without limitation, zinc oxide, magnetite, chromic oxide, aluminum oxide, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, zirconium oxide, cupric oxide, and hydrated oxides such as tungstic acid. Metals of certain of these oxides, such as chromium and copper, have shown some effectiveness as additives, but iron does not appear to benefit the tested magnet compositions to a large extent. Certain oxides, however, such as boric oxide, palladium oxide, tantalum oxide, titanium oxide, and barium oxide, at concentrations which have been tested, either do not significantly improve magnet alloy compositions or degrade properties of the magnets.Presently preferred oxide additives are chromic oxide, aluminum oxide, and magnesium oxide. Carbides and nitrides which are effective in the invention include tungsten carbide and titanium nitride. However, chromium carbide does not appear to be suitable. All rare earth containing alloys for the present invention can be prepared by simply melting together particles of rare earth metal and ferromagnetic metal, using equipment and techniques known in the art.Alternatively, co reduction methods can be used, wherein, for example, rare earth oxide, ferromagnetic metal oxide, or a mixture thereof, is reduced at high temperature with an active metal, such as calcium. An exemplary procedure is mixing rare earth oxide, cobalt metal, and calcium, then heating in an inert atmosphere to produce a rare earth cobalt alloy and calcium oxide. Typically, the co reduction product is subjected to treatment for removal of the calcium oxide see Cech et al., U.S.Patent 3,625,779, described previously certain alloy and oxide mixtures can be utilized in the present invention without separation treatment, thereby reducing the number of steps needed for producing magnets. To prepare magnets, using a typical embodiment of the invention, the rare earth ferromagnetic alloy powder, preferably having particle sizes up to about 10 microns, is intimately mixed with sintering aid, having a similar or smaller particle size range and distribution. Additive material, preferably having approximately the same particle sizes as alloy and sintering aid, or smaller, is added and thoroughly mixed with the other components. Magnetic domains of the mixture are aligned in a magnetic field, preferably simultaneously with a compacting step, in which a shape is formed from the powder. The shape is then sintered to form a magnet having good mechanical integrity, under conditions of vacuum or an inert atmosphere such as argon .Typically, sintering temperatures about 9500 C. to about 12500 C. are used. By use of the invention, permanent magnets having increased coercivity, and demagnetization curves which are more square in shape, can be produced. In many magnets, the coercivity enhancement also yields a higher energy product. However, even those magnets in which only increased coercivity is obtained are made more useful for many applications, such as electric motors and microwave devices. While the invention is not to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that sintering of Rd5 magnets results in the formation of discrete R2M7 phase regions around and between the RMg particles. The additives of this invention appear to remain at the surfaces of the rare earth ferromagnetic metal alloy and sintering aid particles, causing the sintering aid R2M7 regions to be dispersed throughout the sintered magnet and preventing undesirable growth of the R2M7 grains. A further possible explanation for improved results obtained depends upon a reduction in magnetic domains at the more magnetically soft R2M7 centers. As the number of domains in these centers decreases with decreased grain size, a higher resistance to demagnetization occurs. Coercivity enhancement is obtained by preventing easy propagation of domain reversal fromR2M7 to RMg centers. In general, the use of greater amounts of additive, within the aforementioned range, results in improved magnets. A point will be reached, however, after which increments of additive begin to become deleterious, since excessive additive at the boundary produces R2M17 inclusions, decreasing coercivity. It has also been discovered that the magnetic properties of praseodymium cobalt based magnets can be improved, without using the additive material. To prepare magnets, using this embodiment of the invention, a praseodymium cobalt alloy powder, preferably having particle sizes up to about 10 microns, is intimately mixed with sintering aid, having a similar or smaller particle size range and distribution. Magnetic domains of the mixture are aligned in a magnetic field, preferably simultaneously with a compacting step, in which a shape is formed from the powder. The shape is then sintered to form a magnet having good mechanical integrity, under an inert atmosphere such as argon . Typically, sintering temperatures about 10200 C. to about 10900 C. are used. Sintering temperatures should be adjusted, depending upon the particular sintering aid utilized in the mixture. For praseodymium cobalt sintering aid, temperatures about 10200 C. to about 10500 C. are preferred for samariumcobalt sintering aid, the preferred temperatures are about 10700 C. to about 10900 C. The invention will be further described by the following examples, which are not intended to be limiting, the invention being defined solely by the appended claims. In the examples, all percentage compositions are expressed on a weight basis. Example 1 Permanent magnets are prepared, using the following procedure a particles of praseodymium and cobalt are pelted together, using an induction furnace and an alumina crucible, to prepare an alloy having the desired composition for the major phase of a magnet b particles of samarium, or praseodymium, and cobalt are melted together, as above, to prepare an alloy to be used as a sintering aid c alloys are removed from their crucibles, adhering oxide material is removed from the surface by wire brushes, and the alloys are separately crushed and ground in an air atmosphere to particle sizes less than about 70 mesh, after which the particles are subjected to milling with steel balls inside an attrito mill under toluene and an argon atmosphere d desired proportions of powdered major phase alloy and sintering aid alloy are placed in a container and mixed by shaking e the mixture is placed in a cylindrical die having a diameter of 12.7 millimeters and loosely compacted, then subjected to a 7,000 Gauss alignment field, surrounding the die, for about 5 seconds f while maintaining the alignment field, die pressure is increased, over an additional 5 seconds, 8 abut 4.8 2 to about 4.8 x 10 Newton meter and g shapes formed in the die are wrapped in tantalum foil and sintered under an argon atmosphere for one hour, followed by cooling to 9000 C. and annealing at that temperature for about four hours and a rapid quenching to temperatures below 3000 C. Following this procedure, magnets having properties summarized in Table I are prepared. The praseodymium cobalt alloy contains 34 Pr and 66 Co, using an impure praseodymium containing 1.6 Fe, 0.37 Ni, and 1.9 rare earths other than praseodymium. The magnets are formed from a mixture containing 88 Pr Co and 12 of a sintering aid, which is 60 Sm and 40 Co. The ends of these prepared magnets are ground, using 180 and 600 grit silicon carbide grinding papers, followed by polishing on a diamond wheel and, finally, on a cloth wheel, using submicron alumina dispersed in water as a polishing medium. After etching for a few seconds in a 1 nitol solution, the polished ends are examined under a microscope. Figures 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, and 1E are, respectively, photomicrographs at 330X magnification of magnets in Table 1 sintered at 11100 C., 11000 C., 10900 C., 10800 C., and 10700 C. From the Figures, it can be seen that grain size increases with increasing sintering temperatures. Figure 2 is a graph, showing the relationships between sintering temperature and magnetic properties for magnets prepared in this example. It can be seen that lower temperatures produce improved magnets, even though those magnets as shown in TableI have lower densities. Table ISintering Br H c iHc BHmax DensityTemp. C.

Example 6 Using the procedure of Example 1, magnets having properties summarized in Table VI are prepared.These preparations show the effect of samarium cobalt sintering aid upon magnetic properties of praseodymiumcobalt magnets.

Results are summarized in Table VII, demonstrating improved magnetic properties when additives are used.Magnet 21 is a comparative samarium cobalt composition containing 36.58 Sm and no added praseodymium, sintered at 11200C. All other magnets have a rare earth content of 37.58 30.0 Pr and 7.58 Sum . Two magnets from Table VII, designated 2H and 2T, are selected for metallographic examination. The ends of these magnets are ground, using 180 and 600 grit silicon carbide grinding papers, followed by polishing on a diamond wheel and, finally, on a cloth wheel, using submicron alumina particles, dispersed in water, as a polishing medium. After etching for a few seconds in a 1 nitol solution, the polished ends are examined under a microscope. Figure 3A is a photomicrograph at 500X magnification of Magnet 2T. Figure 3B is a photomicrograph, under similar magnification, of Magnet 2H, showing the relatively greater phase dispersion obtained by using an additive. Figure 4 shows certain magnetic properties of the two magnets. In the graph, broken lines represent data for Magnet 2T, while solid lines are for Magnet 2H. These demagnetization curves indicate the improvement in coercivity obtained with the additives. Also significant is the dramatic improvement in squareness of the curves, indicating the resistance of the magnet to domain reversal in a demagnetizing field.
