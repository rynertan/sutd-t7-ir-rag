## Description
The present invention is concerned with an apparatus for heating, more particularly the invention concerns the heating of drums and their contents. Many industrial and chemical products have a high viscosity at low temperatures, and it is therefore often difficult to handle quantities of such products contained in drums under cold or cool conditions. Furthermore, it is common to store the above mentioned products outside of manufacturing plant, and although the interior of the plant may be at a temperature sufficient to lower the viscosity of the product, the rate of heat transfer into the drum or other container may be insufficient to warm the contents quickly if the product is needed urgently. As a consequence, various means for heating drums have been suggested. In the known prior art, drums and other such containers have been heated by steam coils or jackets or by radiant electrical heating in order that the contents may be handled at a temperature at which the viscosity of the content is lower than the viscosity at the ambient temperature. It has also been suggested that induction heating could be employed as an alternative to radiant and or steam heating, as disclosed in DE B 1123 060 and GB A 839 343. It is found that the cost of constructing a robust induction heater is prohibitive. Known induction heaters suffered from inevitable mishandling during use, which resulted in the exposure of, and damage to, the current carrying windings. This is not only dangerous to the user, but also necessitates replacement of the heater. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided an induction heater as defined in claim 1. By providing the abovementioned inwardly projecting protruberances, it is possible to greatly reduce the abrasion of the inner surface of the article and so prevent exposure of the conducting coils which lie below the said inner surface. Conveniently the protruberances are axially extending ribs. Although the magnetic flux through the interior of the coil is substantially uniform near the centre of the coil, there is some variation from the ideal Helmholz field. In the interests of uniform heating the article is thus located by means of the axial protruberances. In order to prevent damage to the coils after extended use, it has been found useful to incorporate a coloured material in to the ribs as a layer provided towards the base of each rib. As the rib is worn down towards the inner surface of the jacket, the coloured material becomes exposed and provides and indication that the induction heater should be re lined. Although it is considered that the most useful coloured material would be relatively hard and therefore not mark the drum, it is also considered that in certain applications the coloured material could be sufficiently soft to leave a visible mark on the drum. Typically, the induction heater comprises a cylindrical jacket and an induction coil, the jacket comprising a cylindrical former on the outside of which the coil is wound, and an outer cover in the form of a plurality of part cylindrical segments joined together to cover the outside of the coil. By employing this form of construction, preferably with two shells forming the outer cover, it is possible to construct an induction heater having a relatively smooth outer surface. This is important in many applications where hygenic conditions are required. Furthermore the multi part construction aids rebuilding of the heater when the wear limit is reached. The protruberances may be integral with the cylindrical jacket, or may be secured thereto by glue or some suitable fixing means. In a particular embodiment the invention consists in an induction heater which comprises a substantially cylindrical jacket adapted to be placed around an article which is to be heated, wherein the jacket includes an induction coil to inductively heat the article, and a plurality of ribs disposed upon the inner surface of the jacket to keep the article spaced apart from the surface to avoid abrasion of the surface by the article, wherein each rib is attached to the surface by an adhesive substance containing carbon black. Although the invention has been defined in general terms it should be understood that the most preferable embodiment of the invention resides in an induction heater for drums and or their contents. The material for the construction of the heater is a fibre glass resin composite material, which may be treated with a suitable fire retardant, if not inherently fire retardant. In order that the invention may be further understood it will be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Turning to figure 1 there is shown an inductive drum heater 1 , comprising an inner glass fibre composite former 2 having flanged ends 3 . The inner former 2 is provided with a plurality of inwardly projecting ribs 4 which serve to locate an article within the heater and protect the inner surface of the former 2 from abrasion and damage. The flanged ends 3 are provided with apertures 12 to be used as lifting holes. A continuous coil of single core 12swg copper wire 5 , is wound onto the outer surface of the former 2 , and covered with an outer shell 6 , fitting within the flange 3 . In the example illustrated, the outer shell 6 is in two parts and is secured to the former 2 . The two parts of the shell are secured together along seams 8 . It is prefered that once the coil 5 has been wound onto the inner former, a mixture of fibre glass resin and catalyst are layered with fibre glass matting onto the coil. A connection box 7 , is provided on the shell 6 for the supply of current to the coil 5 . As is shown in more detail in figure 2, some or all of the ribs 4 , may be provided with a coloured layer 9 at or near to the base of each rib. In the example given the bonding layer employed to secure the ribs to the inner surface of the former includes a coloured additive, more particularly carbon black mixed with the resin component of the fibre glass. When the ribs are sufficiently worn this layer is exposed giving a visual indication that the ribs 4 need refitting. It should be understood that the heater can be employed with non conducting articles provided that a conducting body is brought into contact with the article within the inductive heating field of the coil, such that this body is heated by eddy currents generated by the magnetic flux linkage with the coil. It is envisaged that the drum heater may be powered directly from the 50Hz mains 240 volts AC , or from a suitable transformer. As it is envisaged that the apparatus will be in the majority of embodiments a class II appliance, it does not generally require an earth. Various modifications may be made within the scope of the present invention, such as the inclusion into the drum heater of thermostatic control means and or means to give either a visible or audible indication that the heater is in operation to prevent the exposure of sensitive apparatus to the alternating magnetic fields produced by the coil.
