When X is an unsaturated alkyl it is preferably a straight chain C7 18 alkyl group containing one carbon to carbon double bond.When X is cycloalkyl or cycloalkylalkyl, it preferably has a total of up to twelve carbon atoms in the group. Suitably, when R1, R2 and R3 are simultaneously acyl radicals they are identical. Compounds of formula I may be prepared by treating a compound of formula II EMI3.2 wherein Y is as defined in formula I , with an acylating agent of formulaEMI4.1 wherein L is a good leaving group, such as a halogen atom or a carboxylate group. Suitably these acylating agents are acid halides, or symmetrical or unsymmetrical anhydrides. Preferably when the acylating agent is an acid halide, L is a chlorine atom. The acylation reaction will generally produce a mixture of reaction products. The extent of acylation will depend on a number of factors, such as the relative amounts and chemical natures of reactants, the physical conditions of the reaction, and the solvent system. The mixture may separate into its pure components on using standard chromatographic techniques. 3,3 ,5 Triacylated compounds of formula I , ie those in which R1, R2 and R3 are all acyl groups of formulaEMI4.2 wherein X is as defined in formula I , may be prepared by treating a compound of formula II with a large excess of an acylating agent of formulaEMI4.3 Suitably the molar ratio of reactants is about 4 1 of acylating agent to substrate. The reaction is suitably carried out in an anhydrous polar organic solvent, preferably anhydrous pyridine, at room temperature. The product is preferably purified by recrystallisation from ethanol. 5 Monoacylated compounds of formula I , in whichR1 is an acyl group and R2, R3 are hydrogen atoms, and 3 ,5 diacylated compounds of formula I in which R1 and R2 are acyl groups may be prepared in a similar manner as the triacylated compound described above but using lower molar ratios of the compound of formulaEMI5.1 to starting compound of formula II . The molar ratio of reactants is suitably about 1 1 for the preparation of 5 mono acylated compounds of formula I . Suitably 2 to 3 molar equivalents of the acylating agent may be used in the preparation of the 3 ,5 diacylated compounds of formula I . The reaction is suitably carried out in anhydrous pyridine at room temperature, and the product purified by re crystallisation from ethanol, or by standard chromatographic techniques. 3 Monoacylated compounds of formula I in whichR2 is an acyl group and both R1 and R3 are hydrogen atoms, may be prepared by treating a compound of formula III EMI5.2 wherein R2 is an acyl group, R3 is hydrogen, R5 is phenyl or para methoxy phenyl, and Y is as defined in formula I , with an acid, preferably acetic acid, at room temperature or slightly above room temperature.

The product is preferably purified chromatographically by, for example, column chromatograpy on silica gel. The acylating agents of formula XCO.L are either known compounds or can be prepared from known compounds by conventional means. The compounds of formula III wherein R2 is an acyl group and R3 is either a hydrogen atom or an acyL group, may be prepared by treating a 5 O trityl or a 5 O dimethoxytrityl compound of formula IV EMI7.1 with a compound of formulaEMI7.2 The reaction conditions are similar to those described above for the preparation of the 3,3 ,5 triacylated compounds, preferably using an approximately 3 1 molar ratio ofEMI7.3 to compounds of formula IV . The resultant mixture may be separated using standard chromatographic techniques in order to afford a pure sample of either the 3 mono or 3,3 diacylated compounds of formula III . The compounds of formulae III and IV are important intermediates in the preparation of the 3,3 di and 3 monoacylated compounds and are themselves novel compounds which form a further aspect of the present invention. The compounds of formula IV may be prepared by treating a compound of formula II as defined above, with a triphenylhalomethane compound, preferably triphenyl chloromethane. The reaction is suitably carried out in an anhydrous polar organic solvent, preferably at room temperature. The product may be purified by column chromatography on silica gel. 3 Monoacylated compounds of formula I in whichR3 is an acyl group and R1, R2 are both hydrogen, may be prepared by selective saponification of 3,3 ,5 triacylated compounds of formula I in which R1, R2 andR3 are all acyl groups. The reaction is suitably carried out in a polar organic solvent, preferably a lower alcohol, for example methanol, containing a suitable base, preferably an alkali metal lower alkoxide, for example sodium methoxide, at room temperature.
