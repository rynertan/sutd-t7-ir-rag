## Description
The present invention relates to the production of polymers and copolymer of conjugated diolefins with 1,4 cis structure, by means of the catalytic polymerization of monomer butadiene, by means of an either continuous or batch process, operating either in the presence or in the absence of diluents, and carrying out a portionwise addi tion, during the course of the polymerization, of the organometallic component of the catalyst. In the art various catalytic processes are known for the polymerization of butadiene, suitable to produce polybutadiene with high content of 1,4 cis units, parti cularly suitable in the manufacturing of tyres and other elastomeric articles. The catalysts generally used to that purpose derive from the combination of compounds of transition metals, such as titanium, cobalt, nickel, uranium and rare earth metals, with alkyl and or hydride derivatives of metals of IA, IIA and IIIA Groups of the Periodic System, such as disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Patents 3,118,864 3,178,402 3,794,604 and 4,242,232 and in Belgian Patents 559,676 573,680 and 791,709. According to such processes, the polymerization of butadiene is mainly conducted in solution or anyway in the presence of hydrocarbon diluents. Also processes are known for the production of 1,4 cis polybutadiene by mass polymerization, i.e., polymeri zation in the absence or in the substantial absence of said diluents. U.S. Patent 3,770,710 relates in fact to a process for the mass polymerization of diolephinic monomers with lithium catalysts by operating in a conventional reactor, in two steps at different temperatures, and evaporating the monomer to control the temperature. The operation by controlled steps derives exclusive ly from the need of avoiding or at least minimizing the phenomena related to the foam and of completing the polymerization at higher temperature. We are moreover acquainted with the European Patent Application Puplication Nr. 0127236 filed on December 5,1984 rela ting to a process for the catalytic polymerization of butadiene to 1,4 cis polybutadiene, carried out in the absence, or in the substantial absence, of solvents or diluents. According to said process, a catalytic mixture is prepared by placing in contact, in a hydrocarbon carrier, one o more compounds of neodymium, one or more halogen supplying compounds, one or more hydroxy containing com pounds and an organometallic and or hydride compound of aluminium. Such catalytic mixture is placed in contact with liquid monomer butadiene, and the resulting mixture is continuously supplied to one end of an extended poly merization reactor of the plug flow type, in which the polymerization of butadiene takes place. As an alterna tive, to said polymerization reactor a stream of the catalytic mixture and a stream of liquid butadiene is continuously fed. The polymerization heat is removed by partial evapo ration of monomer butadiene, so that, by controlling the pressure of this latter, maintaining the polymerization temperature within the prefixed range results possible. Furthermore, by controlling the composition of the cata lyst, the butadiene catalyst ratio, the polymerization temperature and the residence time inside the reactor, it results possible to produce mixtures containing from about 25 to about 90 by weight of polymer, which are continuously discharged from the other end of polymeriza tion reactor. From the discharged mixture, 1,4 cis polybutadiene is recovered, as the end product, by evaporating unreact ed butadiene and the solvent possibly used as the carrier for the catalyst, from the polymeric mass to which a short stopper for the catalyst and stabilizers against thermo oxidative breakdown have been added. Such evaporation takes place in a solvent remover extruder. However, by operating in continuous according to such process, with an inlet temperature not lower than 30 C, generally a 1,4 cis polybutadiene is obtained, the value of Mooney Viscosity ML of which is not constant, because of an insufficient homogenizing of the system constituted by the catalyst, the monomer and the polymer. Also by operating by the processes in solution as hereinabove mentioned, a product is obtained, the average molecular weight of which varies often considerably with varying conversion. We have now found that overcoming the above mention ed drawback is possible, hence obtaining a 1,4 cis poly butadiene with rigorously controlled molecular weight, thus avoiding oscillations of the related values of Moo ney viscosity. Further advantages of the invention are hereunder listed. It is hence the purpose of the present invention a process which, by means of the combination of a suitable catalystic system and of an adequate polymerization proc ess, allows the above said difficulties to be overcome and allows obtaining, with high yield, straight chain and gel free 1,4 cis polybutadiene, with high and rigorously controlled molecular weight, by operating either in con tinuous or batchwise, in the presence or in the absence of diluents, by effecting a portionwise addition of the organometallic component of the catalyst during the pro gress of the polymerization. It is hence the object of the present invention a process of the preparation of polymers or of copolymers of butadiene with high content in 1,4 cis units, using a catalytic system constituted by The polymerization is initially carried out with an aluminium metal of Group III B ratio, by gram atoms, comprised within the range of from 10 1 to 30 1, and additions are effected of the Al compound to arrive to an end ratio comprised within the range of from 20 1 to 80 1, with the modalities and within the times as hereun der defined. The The times and modalities of the addition of the aliquot of Al compound to be added portionwise are re lated to the duration of polimerization, and to the starting and end conditions they depend also on the adopted process type. The conditions preferred are those under which the addition is carried out in a continuous way, matching with the kinetic profile of the reaction. To practical purposes, it is however enough to add the aliquot of So, e.g., if said aliquot represents a fairly high portion e.g., 50 of all As the a metal derivative, any compound described in the technical literature, either of organic or inor ganic nature, can be used. Among all of them, the Applicant has observed parti cular advantages when neodymium compounds, such as the oxide, the alkoxides and the carboxylates, are used, which, accordingly to the foregoing, can be used both in the pure state, and in association with other derivatives of other metals selected among those above defined, e.g., praseodymium and lanthanum. The The Water, as well as the other compounds belonging to Monomer capable of polymerizing by the process here in disclosed are all conjugated diolephins, and in parti cular 1,3 butadiene, 1,3 pentadiene, isoprene. The copolymers result interesting of two or more of the said monomers, due to their microstructure, essen tially all of 1,4 cis type, and for the random distribu tion of the monomeric units, in particular those between butadiene and isoprene and between butadiene and piperyl ene, whose crystallization temperatures are controlled by the compositions. The advantages of the present invention are mainly that of using an Al alkyl compounds separately as a catalytic component and as transfer agent, and that of rendering the average molecular weight of the co polym er, and hence its Mooney ML viscosity independent from conversion, that deriving from a saving of the same c component, which is performed with the end result, in terms of conversion and of ML, remaining the same. In order to better illustrate these concepts, refer ence is made to Fig. 1 referred to the results of Exam ples 1 9 , wherein in abscissa the conversion and in ordinate the Mooney ML viscosity is reported. The curve The advantage of the trend according to In case the polymerization is carried out by a process of mass polymerization, the present invention is preferably practically embodied according to the follow ing outline. A catalytic mixture is prepared by placing in contact the individual components, preferably in the presence of a small amount of monomer s to be polymerized In any case, the polymerization can be carried out in continuous in an equipment of the type of self cleaning single screw or twin screw extruder, with a one step process, maintaining an inlet temperature not lower than 30 C and an outlet temperature not higher than 130 C, and preferably within the range of from 50 to 100 C. As an alternative, it can be carried out in continu ous in more subsequent steps, using reactors of the type of self cleaning single screw or twin screw reactors, or batchwise in a stirred reactor. The carrier used for the catalyst according to the process in mass can be constituted by inert non reac tive low boiling or relatively low boiling alicyclic, cyclic or branched hydrocarbons, such as butane, pentane, hexane, cyclohexane and heptane or mixtures thereof. These hydrocarbons introduced together with the catalyst in small amount, also decidedly lower than 5 by weight of produced polymer, are separated from polybutadiene at the end of polymerization, e.g., in a suitable solvent remover extruder. According to another form of embodiment, the carrier for the catalyst is constituted by hydrocarbons or hydro carbon mixtures, of high molecular weight, such as paraf fin oil and the like, or hydrocarbon oils required for formulations of oleo extended polybutadienes. These hydrocarbons need not to be separated and remain incorporated in polybutadiene. In particular, it has been found that when the content of paraffin oil and the like is lower than about 5 by weight relatively to the polymer, the characteristics of this latter are not modified to an appreciable extent. According to a form of continuous embodiment of the mass process, into a polymerization reactor a stream of catalytic mixture and a stream of liquid butadiene are independently fed, according to ratios of from 10⁴ to 4.10⁵ g.moles of butadiene per each gram.atom of Nd. The pressures under which the polymerization is carried out are the equilibrium pressures at the selected temperature. For the above indicated temperature range, said pressure values are conveniently selected within the range of from 3 to 18 absolute bars. By operating within the range of general conditions as previously disclosed, from the reactor a mixture is discharged with a polymer content of from 25 to 90 by weight, by operating with residence times of from 10 to 120 minutes. Under the preferred operating conditions, the residence times are of the order of 10 30 minutes. Due to economical reasons, operating is convenient with relatively high values of butadiene conversion into the related polymer, dischar ging from the reactor mixtures with a polymer content of 60 90 by weight. According to a form of embodiment of the present invention, the mixture outcoming from the polymerization reactor is sent to a mixing device, where in the polymerization stopping agents short stoppers and the stabilizers against the thermo oxidative degrada tion of the polymer are fed, preferably as a solution in butadiene. To deactivate the catalyst, water or organic acids, such as the resinic acids, or higher aliphatic alcohols containing, e.g., from 8 to 18 carbon atoms in their molecule or their combinations are preferably used, also with sequential treatments, in such amounts as to globally exceed the sum of the catalytic components by at least 5 10 times by mol. To the short stopper different from acids, alkalify ing agents soluble in it, such as ammonia, amines, epox ides and organic salts alcoxides and carboxylates of alkaline metals are preferably added. To the hydrocarbon solution, besides the usual anti oxidizer compounds useful for the preservation of the polymer, such as the sterically hindered phenols and phosphites, radical catching compounds, such as secondary amines and the same epoxides, are preferably added. The two solutions can be conveniently emulsified with each other. The so treated mass can be sent to a further heated screw device solvent remover extruder , wherein the volatile substances are evaporated off, by operating at temperatures comprised within the range of from 100 to 180 C and under a pressure equal to or close to the atmospheric pressure. By this treatment, the unreacted butadiene, the possible low boiling solvent introduced together with the catalytic mixture, as well as the water possibly fed in excess over that required for the destruction of the catalytic system are removed. Butadiene and possible low boiling solvent undergo the usual processings for their separation and recycle. Such polybutadiene shows a content of 1,4 cis units generally higher than 97 , and a Mooney viscosity M.L. 1 4, 100 C . of from 30 to more than 80. So, by means of the process according to the present invention, achieving is possible a straight, gel free polybutadiene with a very high content in 1,4 cis units. Said polymer does not require any washing treatments for the separation of the catalyst residues. Furthermore, the mass process here disclosed is simple and convenient, it requires low energy consump tions and does not show problems of environmental charac ter, due to the elimination of the wastes, and can also be advantageously used for the copolymerization of buta diene with other conjugated diolephins, such as, e.g., isoprene and piperylene, copolymers with essentially 1,4 cis structure being obtained. In the embodiment in solution of the present proc ess, the polymerization reaction is carried out in the presence of solvents inert towards the catalyst, which are the same as previously indicated as diluents for the catalyst. Also the polymerization temperature is comprised within the above indicated range of from 30 to 130 C, and preferably of from 50 to 100 C. The reaction times are in this case longer than those of the mass process and range from about 20 minutes up to some hours. The process in solution can be accomplished both in continuous and batchwise, using the reactors of the homogene out type or of plug flow type, a product having the above disclosed characteristics, i.e., polymers and copolymers with straight structure with linkage of essentially 1,4 cis type being always obtained. All operational details shall be evident from the reading of the following Examples, having the only pur pose of illustrating the invention without limiting the purposes thereof. In a glass bottle with heavy walls, of about 100 ml a capacity, a magnetic anchor is introduced, then in the order The bottel is capped with a crown cap provided with a bore and neoprene gasket, and is placed in a tempera ture controlled bath kept at 80 C. The anchor is kept vigorously whirled by means of a rotary magnet. After 5 minutes, by means of a microsyringe, 80 µl of aqueous HCl at 37 by weight are introduced. The reaction at 80 C is continued over a total of 2 hours. The content of the bottel is then slowly transferred into a 1 l flask con taining, under a N₂ atmosphere, a 1.1 molar solution of i.C₄H₉ ₂AlH 371 ml . The addition is carried out under stirring and at room temperature. Twentyfour hours after the preparation, the catalyt ic solution so obtained is analytically titrated, showing the following molarities g.atoms l Eight indentical reactors with glass body and head of stainless steel equipped with valves are used. Into each reactor 360 ml of hexane and 80 g of butadiene are charged under a N₂ atmosphere. In all tests an equal amount 1.0 ml has been used of the catalyst prepared as hereinabove disclosed, but in some of them additional i.C₄H₉ ₂AlH has been added, in the amounts and at the times as shown in the following Table the time t is measured from the introduction of the catalyst . Also the duration of the individual tests t has been varied as shown, however maintaining a comparison criterion between the two 1 4 and 6 9 series. The polymerizations have been stopped at the times shown by means of the indroduction of 2 ml of ethanol diluted in 10 ml of hexane containing 1 g of dissolved antioxidizer AO 2246. The polymer has been recovered from the solution by coagulating in an excess of ethanol, and drying the solid The catalyst is prepared in a way similar to the disclosure reported in Example 1, with the only variant of the amounts of t.BuCl and of i.C₄H₉ ₂AlH used in the reaction, which are, respectively 5.6 ml instead of 4.25 and 412 ml of 1.1 molar solution in vaseline oil instead of 371 . The new solution gives the following analysis Nd 0.0474 g.atoms.l Al 0.9480 Cl 0.0962 Tests of mass polymerization of butadiene are se quentially carried out in a stainless steel reactor of 2 l of capacity, provided with mechanical stirrer and with system for the outer condensation and the recycle of the monomer evaporated during the constant pressure reaction. Into the reactor under a nitrogen atmosphere 500 g of butadiene, and after having isothermed at 60 C, 8.4 ml of the above disclosed catalytic solution equivalent to 0.4 mmol of Nd are charged, in addition to i.C₄H₉ ₂AlH in the amounts and at the times t as shown in the following Table All the three tests are interrupted after 20 minutes from the introduction of the catalyst, making residual butadiene rapidly evaporate. During the polymerization the pressure is kept at 6.7 bars and the vapours formed are condensed and recycled to the reaction. The solid product obtained in plunged and crumbled in an excess of ethanol containing 1 of AO 2246 to the only purpose of neutralizing the still active catalyst, and is then dried The recorded conversions and Mooney viscosities are reported in the Table. The polymers result free from gel and with a cis titre comprised within the range of from 97.6 to 97.8 . The comparison of ML values shows the better effect or regulation of molecular weights accomplished with the delayed addition of a portion of Al alkyl catalytic com ponent. Into the vessel 10 with 5 l capacity see attached Fig. 2 , provided with stirrer and heat exchange system, under nitrogen atmosphere, through the line 22 220 g 0.62 mol of neodymium oxide Nd₂O₃ at 95 945 g 3.9 mol of naphthenic acid, with acidity number 230 180 g 1.9 mol of tert.butyl chloride at 98 2.8 kg of vaseline oil 10 ml of aqueous solution of HCl at 37 by weight, are charged. The mixture is kept stirred inside the vessel 10 , under nitrogen atmosphere, at the temperature of 60 C, for 3 hours. At the end of this time period, a mixture having the appearance of an oil is obtained. The so obtained mixture is charged, by the line 24 , into the vessel 12 , of 120 l of capacity, provided with stirrer. Into the vessel 12 , through the line 26 , also 50 l are charged of a solution containing 0.8 mol l of aluminium diisobutyl monohydride in vase line oil. The mass is kept stirred under nitrogen at room tempe rature about 20 C , for 2 hours. At the end of this time period, a catalytic solution is obtained having the following concentrations, re ferred to neodymium, aluminium and chlorine neodymium 0.023 g.atoms l aluminium 0.74 g.atoms l chlorine 0.034 g.atoms l. So, the chlorine neodymium ratio results equal to about 1.5 1, and the aluminium neodymium ration results equal to about 32 1 by g.atoms. The catalytic solution is drawn from the vessel 12 , by the line 28 , at the flow rate of 330 ml hour and is mixed with liquid and anhydrous butadiene, out coming from the line 30 , at the flow rate of 36 l hour. Said butadiene outcomes partly from the fresh buta diene drying section not shown through the line 32 about 14 l hour , and partly from the recycle from reactor 16 , through the line 34 about 22 l hour , after prior condensation in 36 . Butadiene and the catalytic solution are conveyed through the line 38 to the mixer 14 , provided with stirrer, of 1.5 l of capacity. The mixing temperature is of about 30 C. The mixture leaving the mixer 14 is supplied through the line 40 to the polymerization reactor 16 . The reactor 16 is a self cleaning screw type reactor, with a total volume of 23 l and with a useful volume of 16 l, into which the polymerization mixture flows with a movement of plug flow type. The operational conditions inside reactor 16 are pressure 6.7 bar, inlet temperature about 60 C, and outlet temperature about 90 C. The polymerization heat is removed by partial evapora tion of butadiene, which is drawn through the line 34 and recycled, after preliminary condensation in condenser 36 . Under these conditions, from reactor 16 a mixture containing about 70 by weight of polymer is dis charged, and is supplied to the screw device 18 , to which water is fed by the line 42 , at the rate of 150 ml hour. In a more downstream point of device 18 , by the line 44 and at the flow rate of 300 ml h a solution containing 100 g.l of a conventional antioxidizer is vaseline oil is supplied. The so treated mass is conveyed, for the elimination of volatile components, to the device 20 , wherein, at the temperature of 130 C and under the atmospheric pressure, residual butadiene and water, which are sent to the reaction of butadiene recovery not shown through the line 46 , ae removed. From device 20 , through the line 48 about 6 kg h are recovered of polybutadiene having average Mooney viscosity of 40. The instantaneous values of Mooney viscosity are variable, and ocmprised within a range of 15 points. By the procedure as disclosed under part A , a cata lytic solution having the following concentrations neodymium 0.023 g.atoms l aluminium 0.57 g.atoms l chlorine 0.034 g.atoms l is prepared. The atomic chlorine neodymium results hence of about 1.5 1, and aluminium neodymium ratio of about 25 1. By operating in a way similar to previous part A , to the mixer 14 330 ml h of the catalytic mixture and 36 l h of anhydrous liquid butadiene are fed. The operating conditions of the polymerization reactor 16 are the same as of part A , but the fact that about to the central area of the reactor, through the line 50 , 105 ml h are fed of a solution containing 0.5 mol l of aluminium diisobutyl monohydride in vase line oil. By so doing, the Al Nd ratio is increased from 25 1 to 32 1, by g.atoms. The device 18 and the device 20 operate in a way similar as shown under part A . Through the line 48 , about 6 kg h of polybutadiene having an average Mooney viscosity of 37, with oscil lations comprised within the range of 2 points, are discharged. Into a glass bottle with heavy walls, of about 100 ml of capacity, a 12 55 mm teflon coated magnetic anchor is introduced, then in the order Naphthenic acids acidity number 200 19.8 g Nd₂O₃ 95 4.04 g Tert.butyl chloride 4.25 ml Hexane 45.0 ml are charged. The bottel is capped with a crown cap provided with a bore and tightly sealing neoprene gasket, and is transferred into a temperature controlled bath kept at 80 C. The anchor is kept vigorously whirled by means of a rotary magnet. After 5 minutes, by means of a microsyringe, and through the rubber gasket, 0.08 ml of HCl in aqueous solution at 37 Carlo Erba are added. After about 80 minutes, the colour of the suspension turns from grayish into nut brown. The reaction is continued at 80 C over a total of 3 hours. The resulting thick solution, titrated after 3 hours of rest at room temperature, supplies a Nd content of 0.343 mol l. It is slowly transferred, over a time of about 5 minutes, into a glass flask wherein 524 ml have alread dy been prepared of 1.04 molar solution of i.Bu ₂AlH in hexane under mechanical stirring, priorily intro duced into the flask under a dry N₂ atmosphere. The so obtained solution is kept twentyfour hours at room temperature before being used. From the ele mental analysis the following concentration result Nd 0.0393 g.atoms l Al 0.908 Cl 0.058 Al Nd 23 and Cl Nd 1.5 by g.atoms . B1. Into a glass reactor having the shape of a long cup, with steel head provided with outlets with valve, of the capacity of about 700 ml, already before its sealing a teflon coated magnetic anchor is introduced. Into the sealed reactor and under a dry N₂ atmosphere, 360 ml 237.6 g of anhydrous hexane are introduced by siphoning. Into it 80 g butadiene and 1.33 ml of the previ ously prepared catalytic solution are then intro duced. The reactor is immediately dipped in water thermostatic bath, already isothermed at the tem perature of 60 C, and the magnetic anchor contain ed in it is made rapidly whirl by means of an outer rotary magnet. The temperature of the reaction mass, thanks also to the polymerization heat, reaches rapidly 60 C. The reaction is continued for 120 minutes, and is then stopped by the introduction of 2 ml of ethyl alcohol diluted with 10 ml of hexane. The polymeric product is recovered by pouring its solution into an excess 1.5 l of ethanol con taining about 250 mg of antioxidizer AO 2246. After drying, 46.6 g of polymer, corresponding to a conversion of 58.2 , are weighed. The Mooney viscosity of the product has not re sulted measurable at 100 C in 1 4 min., it being probably higher than 100. B2. Inside a reactor similar to that disclosed under B1 a polymerization test analogous to the forego ing is carried out, with the only exception of the addition of 1.15 ml of 1.04 molar solution of iBu ₂AlH, such as to double the amount of Al present in the catalyst Al Nd from 23 up to about 46, by g.atoms . After 120 minutes of polymerization at 60 C, the following results are obtained polymer 56.6 g conversion 70.75 Mooney viscosity 1 4, 100 C 42. Inside the same equipment as hereinabove disclosed for the reference B tests, a polymerization of butadiene analogous to the B1, i.e., by using monomer and cata lyst in the same amounts and at the same temperature, is carried out, with the difference that during the progress of the reaction, three aliquots are added, of 0.38 ml each one of 1.04 molar solution of iBu ₂AlH, after 30, 60 and 90 minutes, respectively, from the beginning of the test, such as to increase the Al Nd ratio from its initial value of 23, up to 46. By interrupting the test after 120 minutes, the fol lowing results are obtained dry polymer 55 g conversion 68.75 Mooney viscosity 1 4, 100 C 17. A test of polymerization like that disclosed under C, Example 14, is carried out, with the difference that the aliquots of 1.04 M solutions of DIBAH introduced during the reaction time are of 0.2 ml each, and that the introduction times are the 20th, 40th and 60th minutes from the beginning. In this way, the initial Al Nd ratio, which is 23, is increased up to about 38. After 120 minutes of polymerization, 50.5 g of dry product are obtained conversion 63.1 , with Mooney viscosity 1 4, 100 C of 23.5. A test similar to the one just disclosed see under A. , but wherein all Al alkyl is introduced from the beginning, yields the following results dry polybutadiene 48.4 g conversion 60.5 ML 1 4, 100 C 40.
