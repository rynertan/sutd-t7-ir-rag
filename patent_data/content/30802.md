# SORTING PARTICLES

## Abstract
A process for separating one type of particle e.g., ore particles from a second type of particle e.g., gangue parti cles comprising the steps of 1 conditioning the particles to selectively mark one type of particle i.e. either the ore parti cles or the gangue particles , to the substantial exclusion of the other 2 detecting the marked particles and 3 separat ing the detected marked particles from the substantially unmarked particles is characterised by the use, as a condition ing agent, of a compound having both a surface selective functional group and a detectable moiety. In one embodi ment, the detectable moiety is fluorescent and detecting is performed under ultraviolet radiation. The process is espe cially useful for separating higher grade limestone from lower grade limestone and or gangue or for separating oil shale or coal of high heat value from lower heat content materials or for concentrating valuable minerals, such as silver or copper ores.
