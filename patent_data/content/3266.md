# Apparatus for contacting solid particles with a liquid apparatus and process for the production of phosphoric acid.

## Abstract
Apparatus for contacting solid particles with a liquid in a vessel having an agitator within a vertical draft tube, for instance for dissolving phosphate rock particles in acid, is characterised by means for supplying fluid under pressure to a bottom portion of the vessel to prevent solids settling and to resuspend solids that have settled, e.g. after shutdown. Apparatus for similar purposes is disclosed having a vent for minimising foaming. Also disclosed is a method of start up a continuous phorphoric acid production process in a multi vessel system comprising four vessels 2 , 16 , 28 and 48 .
