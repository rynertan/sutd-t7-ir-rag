# Ordered register subsystem for high speed data processing systems.

## Abstract
Ordered registers are employed in an analog to digital converter implemented in logic operating on the multiple lobes of a threshold curve, such as that of Josephson SQUIDs. Two sampling registers are provided with sufficient offset to guarantee stability at sampling in one or the other regardless of other factors. Knowledge of bit value of the next lower bit order position permits determination of which sampling is valid. Encoder logic selects the valid sampling register retroactively. Each sampling register bit order position 1 to 5 has two sampling SQUIDs 6 to 15 and latching self gated ANDs SGA 0 to SGA 5B . Bias values 12 are provided at higher orders to increment the phase offset so as to ensure low to high order readout. The lowest two bit orders may be implemented in sim plified logic, effectively giving two bit order positions equal to that of one higher order bit position.
