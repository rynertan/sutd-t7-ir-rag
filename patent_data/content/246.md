# Device for locating a battery or like heavy component on a chassis e.g. of an industrial lift truck.

## Abstract
Device for locating a heavy component such as an electrical battery on a chassis such as that of an industrial lift truck, and for preventing dislodgement of the battery even during excessive tilting of the chassis. The apparatus includes a frame formed from two spaced parallel channel members which extend longitudinally of the truck and are bolted to the chassis 10 . In the upper surface of each channel member is a downwardly extending slot 19 in which a respective spigot 18 of the battery 16 is received when the battery 16 is located between the two channel members. A respective flap 21 pivotally attached to each channel member adjacent its slot 19 is then rotated about its pivot into an operative position in which it covers a substantial portion of the slot 19 the end of spigot 18 being accommodated in an aperture 30 in the flap 21 . To retain the flap 21 in its operative position, a second flap or latch 25 pivotally mounted on flap 21 is rotated about its pivot until wings on flap 25 engage an inclined surface 15 of the respective channel member. Thus the flap 21 cannot be released from its operative position until the wings of the flap 25 are disengaged from surfaces 15 . As long as the flaps 21 are held in their operative positions by the respective flaps 25 , the engagement of the spigots 18 in slots 19 and apertures 30 prevents dislodgement of the battery 16 even during excessive tilting of the chassis 10 .
