## Description
DESCRIPTION ORIENTED, HIGH DENSITY POLY ETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE The present invention relates to biaxially oriented poly ethylene terephthalate . Poly ethylene terephthalate , hereinafter called PET, finds many packaging uses, such as a packaging sheet or film, or hollow containers. The normal products of commerce have fairly good or low permeabilities to gases such as CO2 and 02. However, it is often desirable that PET have even lower gas permeabilities. The gas permeability of PET can be decreased by increasing the density thereof through heating to cause crystallization with consequent density increase. It is also usually desired that such PET materials, especially those used for packaging, be clear rather than opaque or even translucent. The prior art teaches that PET film can be oriented and heat set to cause crystallization and consequent increase in density up to a density of 1.402 grams cc. Thus in col. 13 of de Pont Wyeth U.S. patent 3,733,309 it is stated that the maximum crystallinty attainable in biaxially oriented PET bottles is about 60 and in col. 4 it is stated that the 60 percent figure corresponds to a density of 1.402 grams cc. See also claim 1 thereof . Another de Pont patent to Heffelfinger, U.S. patent 3,432,591, bears this out, saying that heat setting of PET film carried to a density over 1.400 grams cc would lead to a loss of toughness.The products of the present invention on the other hand are tough, ductile and clear. In Japanese published application 41,972, laid open April 3, 1979, it is disclosed heat setting should be limited so that the density does not exceed 1.40 grams cc., important from the standpoint of clarity. It has now been found possible to provide new, ductile substantially clear, biaxially oriented, high density PET material useful for packaging. In particular it is possible to produce a new ductile polyeethylene terephthalate material which is clear, biaxially oriented and has a density of over 1.4050 grams cc. at 25 C. By clear PET in this specification and the appended claims is meant that the percent haze measured according to ASTM D 1003 61 reapproved 1977 does not exceed 10 percent. It is usually below 3 percent. The present invention provides biaxially oriented and heat set poly ethylene terephthalate material which has two substantially parallel faces each of an area which is extended as compared to the area of any planar crosssection cutting said two faces, the ratio of extended area to the cross sectional area being at least 10, the poly ethylene terephthalate being clear, ductile and having a density at 25 C. of over 1.4050 grams cc and a percent haze of no more than 10 percent. According to one embodiment of the present invention there is provided clear, biaxially oriented, ductile PET material of an inherent viscosity of at least 0.6 dl. gm., having two opposing generally parallel surfaces of extended area compared to the area of any cross section generally perpendicular to and cutting the two surfaces of extended area, and having a density of at least 1.4050 grams cc.measured at 25 C. The area of one of the extended surfaces is generally at least 10 times the area of such cross section. Thus, the material of the invention includes film or sheet material or a wall of a hollow body such as a hollow container. The thickness of such crosssection is usually less than 0.125cm, 50 mils , more commonly from 0.000125 tq 0.0875 cm 0.5 to 35 mils . When inherent viscosity is referred to herein, it is the viscosity as measured in a 60 40 weight ratio phenol tetrachloroethane solution at 250C, Density was determined by the method described in ASTM 1505, entitled DensityGradient Technique . The new high density, clear, ductile and tough poly ethylene terephthalate material of the present invention can be made by biaxially stretch orienting PET at a temperature conductive to orientation, usually in the range from 75 to 1200C. and more often from 85 to llO C. thereafter, while the PET is under restraint preventing shrinkage, further heating the PET at a temperature of at least 230 C. until its density is over 1.4050 grams cc.Usual heat setting temperatures are 230 to 250 C. In the following examples the products all had the properties of the invention mentioned hereinbefore. In Examples 1 to 4 and the control example, tabulated in Table 1, 2 litre capacity PET bottles were blow moulded at an orientation temperature of about 900C. The stretch ratio was about 4 in the hoop direction and about 2 in the axial direction. The density of the oriented bottle sidewalls was about 1.368 grams cc. This density shows that crystallization took place during orientation, as expected.The bottles were blown into conformance with a cold mould thus the stress due to the stretch blow moulding was frozen in. Square pieces were cut from the bottle sidewalls all except the control sample were clamped in a frame which prevented shrinkage. They were then dried in an oven at 100 C. at high vacuum overnight. Then they were.heated in the same oven at high vacuum at 240 C. for the times noted in Table 1, which also shows the thickness, oxygen permeability in cc.mil 100in2.day.atm, density and percent haze.

The stretch ratio was 3.8 x 3.5 and the final thickness 1.5 mils. The biaxially oriented stretched film was cooled with an air hose. Its density was 1.3600 gms cc. The film was then clamped in a frame preventing shrinkage, dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 10000. and was heated in an oven under high vacuum for 4 hours at 2400C. The film was then cooled and removed from the frame. Its density at 25 C. was 1.4080 grams cc and it had less than 1 percent haze. Example 6 PET film of a nominal 0.05 cm 20 mil thickness and having an inherent viscosity of 0.66 dl. gm. was clamped in a Long Extensional Tester, heated to about 90 C. and stretched at a rate of about 150 Sec. in the machine direction. The stretch ratio was 3.8 x 2 and the final thickness 2.8 mils. The biaxially oriented stretched film was cooled with an air hose. The film was then clamped in a frame preventing shrinkage, dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 100 C. and was heated in an oven under high vacuum for 4 hours at 2500C, The film was then cooled and removed from the frame. Its density at 25 C. was 1.4108 grams cc and it had 1.1 percent haze.
