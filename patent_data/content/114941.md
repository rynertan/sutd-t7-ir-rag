# General purpose liquid scintillation composition.

## Abstract
A general purpose scintillation cocktail comprises an aromatic liquid capable of capturing energy from radiation, at least one fluor compound, and a nonionic liquid surfactant comprised of polyethoxylated polyoxypropylene in which the weight percent of the polyoxyethylene in the molecule exceeds about 40 and in which the molecular weight of the polyoxypropylene portion of the molecule exceeds about 1450.
