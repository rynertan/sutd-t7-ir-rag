# Apparatus and method for transferring and applying material.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for transferring and applying discrete lengths of material to a moving web is disclosed. The material is supplied to a plurality of applicator units 41 . Each applicator unit 41 has a first applicator segment 42 and a second applicator segment 43 . The applicator units 41 are rotated around a drum axis 35a . The web supply section 11 feeds the web 21 to a fluted corrugating roll 22 . The first applicator segment 42 is rotated about a first axis and the second applicator segment 43 is rotated about a second axis, wherein the first and second applicator segments 42 and 43 are linearly aligned when passing under an extruder 27 . Then the first and second applicator segments 42 and 43 rotate around the first and second axis to place the first and second applicator segments in space relationship when the material 33 is bonded to peaks 21a of the web 21 . Then the first and second applicator segments 42 and 43 rotate back around the first and second axis to place the first and second applicator seg ments back in linear alignment. The web removal section 15 removes the web 21 from the fluted corrugating roll 22 and pulls out the corrugations in the web 21 , wherein the material 33 is stretched and bonded to the web 21 between the bonded peaks 21a .
