# DC solenoid actuator circuit.

## Abstract
This invention relates to DC solenoid actuator ciruits. A DC solenoid winding L located to act on an armature, is connected across a rectifier D connected to an AC supply. A capacitor C2 is provided across the winding L so that the initial voltage applied to the solenoid winding is greater than the average actuating voltage. One terminal of the rectifier D is connected to the AC supply via a switch SW1 which can either include in that circuit a capacitor C1 or shunt that capacitor. The switch is mechanically linked to the armature of the solenoid winding L so that at a predetermined point during the stroke of the armature the switch SW1 is operated to include the capacitor C1 in the circuit so as to lower the actuating voltage for the solenoid.
