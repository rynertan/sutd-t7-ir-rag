# Lumen loaded paper pulp, its production and use.

## Abstract
Paper of improved properties is produced from pulp in which filler is selectively and substantially entirely loaded within the fiber lumens by vigorously agitating a suspension of pulp and filler until the lumens become loaded with filler, separating the residual suspended filler from the loaded fibers and vigorously and turbu lently washing the pulp e.g., under conditions of shear, preferably with an aqueous solution of a filler aid, e.g., alum until substantially all of the filler on the external surfaces of the fibers is removed. This procedure achie ves high filler levels within the lumen. Retention on the paper machine is increased by the use of such lumen loaded fibers. The papers have an enhanced combination of strength and optical properties.
