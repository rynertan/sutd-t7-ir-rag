# Automatic tool changer with internal tool storage magazine.

## Abstract
A vertical spindle numerically controlled machining center includes a stationary bed or base 12 on which a workpiece holding table 18 is slidably mounted for move ment along a first axis 16 . A vertically extending upright or column 28 , having a vertically reciprocal spindlehead 42 slidably mounted thereon, is slidably mounted on the bed 12 for movement along a second axis 26 perpendicular to the first axis 16 so that the spindlehead 42 overlies a portion of the table 18 . Within the upright 28 is a recess 78 adjacent to the bed 12 . A tool storage magazine 82 is located in the recess 78 and is slidably mounted on the bed 12 for movement through the recess 78 along an axis parallel to the second axis 26 . During a tool change cycle, the toolholder then held in the spindle 44 is returned to the tool storage magazine 82 by first moving the spindlehead 42 to the ready position and then moving the tool storage magazine 82 toward the spindlehead 42 to engage the tool then held in the spindle 44 . To provide the spindle 44 with a new tool, the spindlehead 42 is first moved upwardly to clear the toolholder shank and then the tool storage maga zine 82 is indexed to position a new tool directly beneath the spindle 44 so that the spindle 44 can engage the tool when the spindlehead 42 is moved downwardly to the ready position.
