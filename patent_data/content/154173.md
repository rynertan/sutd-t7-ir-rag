## Description
This invention relates to the pteridines generally, and more particularly, to pteridine derivatives bearing the particular alkylating moiety in the 6 position on the pteridine nucleus as hereinafter more fully disclosed. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical preparations containing the aforesaid pteridine derivatives and to a process for preparing same. U.S.Patent Nos. 4,077,957 and 4,374,987 describe procedures for preparing pteridine compounds including the anticancer drug methotrexate which possesses the structure N P 2,4 diamino 6 pteridinyl methyl methylamino benzoyl glutamic acid and analogous compounds such as aminopteridine Methotrexate has in recent years become a prominent drug in the treatment of a variety of cancers C.B. Pratt, et al., Analogs of methotrexate are discussed in Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1975, vol. 18, No. 9, 909 912. In accordance with the present invention, pteridine derivatives and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts having potent anticancer activity and which are significantly more target specific than methotrexate and its analogs are provided. The pteridine derivatives of this invention possess the structural formula wherein Y is NH₂, OH or SH, and X is or CH₂ . The pteridine derivatives of the present invention can be readily prepared by those of ordinary skill in the art employing known and conventional syntheses. Thus, for example, preparation of the 2,4 diaminopteridine derivatives in which X is i.e. compounds of the formula can be obtained by reacting the corresponding carboxy acid, under amide forming conditions, with an appropriate amine, to provide the desired derivative. An example of the sequence of reactions is illustrated as follows 2,4 diamino 6 bis 2 chloroethyl carboxamido pteridine The starting compound of the above scheme may be prepared by oxidation of 2,4 diamino 6 hydroxymethyl pteridine, a known intermediate whose preparation is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,077,957. The amide forming conditions referred to herein involve the use of known derivatives of the described acids, such as the acyl halides, anhydrides, mixed anhydrides, lower alkyl esters, carbodiimides, carbonyl diimidazoles, and the like. The reactions are carried out in organic solvents such as acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetic acid, methylene chloride, ethylene chloride and similar such solvents. The abide forming reaction will occur at room temperature or at elevated temperature. The use of elevated temperature is for convenience in that it permits somewhat shortened reaction periods. Temperatures ranging from 0 C up to the reflux temperature of the reaction system can be used. As a further convenience the amide forming reaction can be effected in the presence of a base such as tertiary organic amines, e.g., trimethylamine, pyridine, picolines and the like, particularly where hydrogen halide is formed by the amide forming reaction, e.g., acyl halide and amino compound. Of course, in those reactions where hydrogen halide is produced, any of the commonly used hydrogen halide acceptors can also be used. The 2,4 diaminopteridine derivatives in which X is CH₂ , i.e., compounds of the formula can also be readily prepared via known chemical syntheses. For example, a 6 halomethyl derivative of 2, 4 diamino 6 hydroxymethyl pteridine may be reacted with an appropriate amine, e.g., bis 2 chloroethyl amine, to provide the desired derivative. An exemplary sequence of reactions is illustrated as follows The 6 halomethyl derivative may be prepared by halogenation of hydrohalide salt of the aforesaid known intermediate in the presence of a catalyst and in an aprotic solvent. The reaction sequence would be as follows 2,4 diamino 6 bis 2 chloroethyl aminomethyl pteridine Appropriate catalysts in the above sequence would be, for example, triphenylphosphine and the like. Useful aprotic solvents include, among others, N,N dimethylacetamide, N,N diethylacetamide, 1 methylpyrrolidin 2 one, N,N dimethylpropionamide, acetonitrile, benzonitrile tetrahydrofuran and dioxane. The derivatives herein which are inclusive of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be formulated into a variety of dosage forms as is known in the art and utilized in the treatment of various cancers in the same manner as the currently used drug methotrexate. The following examples illustrate methods for preparing the 2,4 diaminopteridine derivatives of this invention and their use in anticancer therapy. 2,4 diamino 6 bis 2 chloroethyl aminomethyl pteridine To a solution of 42.8 g 0.167 mol of 2,4,5,6 tetraminopyrimidine sulfate monohydrate, which had been recrystallized from boiling 1 N sulfuric acid, in 700 ml of boiling water was added gradually a solution of 40.7 g 0.167 mol of barium chloride dihydrage in 100 ml of water. After a short period of digestion, the mixture was filtered from the precipitated barium sulfate, the filtrate was stirred with 5 g of decolorizing carbon and filtered again. This solution was added to a stirred mixture of 426 g of ammonium chloride, 26.3 g 0.167 mol of cysteine hydrochloride, 46.6 g 0.259 mol of dihydroxyacetone dimer and 970 ml of water in a 3 1 three necked flask equipped with a stirrer and a glass fritted gas inlet tube. The resulting mixture was stirred for 67 hours at room temperature during which time a slow stream of oxygen was passed through the mixture via the gas inlet tube. The product, 2,4 diamino 6 hydroxymethyl pteridine hydrochloride, separate as a tan solid which was collected by suction filtration, washed with water, and air dried yield, 17.2 g 45 . To a solution of 17.2 g of 2,4 diamino 6 hydroxymethyl pteridine hydrochloride in 345 ml of hot water was added 50 ml of 28 aqueous ammonia. After cooling, the solid free base was filtered off and air dried yield, 12.4 g 86 . A stirred mixture of this free base in 800 ml of boiling ethanol was treated with 7.5 ml of 48 hydrobromic acid and allowed to cool. The resulting hdyrobromide salt was collected by suction filtration, washed with ethanol and air dried yield 16.6 g 94 . To a stirred solution of 63.9 g 0.244 mol of triphenylphosphine in 325 ml of N,N dimethylacetamide was added dropwise 39 g 0.244 mol of bromine at a temperature of 10 to 12 C. To this stirred mixture was added 16.6 g 0.061 mol of 2,4 diamino 6 hydroxymethyl pteridine hydrobromide in one portion. After stirring for 2 hours at 20 25 C, 4 ml of ethanol was added, and the mixture was kept in a cold room 4 C overnight. Most of the N,N dimethylacetamide was removed by distillation at a pressure of 1mmHg and a pot temperature not exceeding 45 C. The residue was stirred with 190 ml of benzene, which was decanted from the insoluble semisolid residue. This procedure was repeated with another 190 ml portion of benzene, which was decanted from the insoluble semisolid residue. This procedure was repeated with another 190 ml portion of benzene, and the solid that remained was stirred at 80 C with 435 ml of glacial acetic acid until solution was complete. This mixture was allowed to cool overnight, and the solid that separated was removed by filtration yield 15.5 g. This crude product as recrystallized from boiling isopropanol, filtering from 5 g of insoluble material yield of 2,4 diamino 6 bromomethyl pteridine hydrobromide containing 0.5 mol of isopropanol or crystallation, 8.3 g 34.5 . To a solution of 4 g of 2,4 diamino 6 bromomethyl pteridine hydrobromide in 150 ml of hot water was added 10 ml of 28 aqueous ammonia, and when cool the precipitated free base was filtered, washed with water, and air dried yield, 2.94 g 94 . To a stirred solution of 2.4 g 9.4 mmol of 2,4 diamino 6 bromomethyl pteridine in 50 nl of N,N dimethylacetamide was added 6 g 0.04 mol of bis 2 chloroethyl amine, and the mixture was stirred at 50 55 C for 5 hours and then for 18 hours at room temperature. After filtering from a small amount of dark insoluble matter, the filtrate was diluted with 200 ml of water whereupon 2,4 diamino 6 bis 2 chloroethyl aminomethylpteridine separated as a light tan solid which was filtered, washed thoroughly with water and air dried yield, 0.92 g 31 . 4 g of 2,4 diamino 6 hydroxymethyl pteridine hydrochloride is dissolved in sodium bicarbonate and oxidized by KNnO₄. The oxidized product, 2,4 diamino 6 carboxy acid pteridine, is obtained by neutralizing the reaction mixture with diluted H₂SO₄. Synthetic Route 1 2.5 g 9.5 mmol of 2,4 diamino 6 carboxy acid pteridine is dissolved in DMSO and added to 9.5 mmol of N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCCI . To this reaction mixture is added 6 g 0.4 mmol of bis 2 chloroethyl amine and stirred for 18 hours at room temperature. The reaction mixture is then worked up in the same way as mentioned in step C, Example 1. Synthetic Route 2 2.5 g 9.5 mmol of 2,4 diamino 6 carboxy acid pteridine is dissolved in dry DMF. The solution is cooled to 5 C. To this solution was added 9.5 mmol of N methylmorpholine and stirred for 15 minutes. To the stirred solution was added 9.5 mmol of ethylchloroformate and stirred for 1 2 hour. A freshly prepared bis 2 chloroethyl amine 0.5 mmol in DMF chilled was added dropwise. After 1 2 hour the reaction mixture is brought to room temperature and is left overnight. The reaction mixture is evaporated to dryness. The residue is dissolved in water and neutralized by adding diluted HCl or NaHCO₃ solution. The rest of the procedure is same as stated above. The potency of the compound of Example 1, i.e., 2,4 diamino 6 bis 2 chloroethyl aminomethyl pteridine, was evaluted in B6D2F1 J female mice, Jackson Lab., Bar Harbor, ME . During the course of the experiments, the animals were maintained in a controlled environment with limited accessibility and were permitted free access to food and water. They were divided in groups containing 10 animals in each group. The mice were inoculated intraperitoneally I.P. with 1X10⁵ L 1210 mouse leukemia lymphoblasts. Day zero was the day when L 1210 was injected and the following day, Day 1, the treatment started. Initially the doses of the drug used were 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mg kg and they were used as suspension in distilled water. For the purpose of studying the apparent toxicity of this drug the above doses were also injected I.P. in normal mice of 9 11 weeks of age weighing 22 25 g per mouse. A volume of 0.2 to 0.3 ml of the suspension was injected in each animal. A single dose was used for both toxicity and activity studies. The results from the toxicity studies showed no toxic death of animals from the dose that showed maximum activity, i.e., 5 mg kg. The results of the drug activity is summarized in Figure 1. As it can be seen, the drug had significant effect on the survivability of animals implanted with 1X10⁵ L 1210 tumor cells on Day 0. Several doses were examined and in each instance there was noticeable prolongation of lifespan compared to the control broken line in Figure 1 . For example, animals receiving 2.5 mg kg of the drug had an increased lifespan of 190 , while animals receiving 5 mg kg dose showed a remarkable survivability solid line in Figure 1 . This dose was repeated twice and in each study it showed the similar survival pattern, i.e., 50 of the animals had an increased lifespan of more than 200 , while the other 50 of the animals were totally cured and even remained alive at the end of 90 days. However, those animals receiving the drug at 10 and 20 mg kg extended the lifespan 250 and 140 , respectively, and 20 of the animals treated with 10 mg kg remained alive at the end of 30 days see Figure 1 . The activity of 2,4 diamino 6 bis 2 chloroethyl aminoethyl pteridine was also tested on solid tumor. BALB C adult female mice were given 2X10⁶ viable MOPC 104E cells intravenously. 18 Days following the transplantation of tumor, when the tumor burden was large and at an advanced stage, the mice were treated with 5 mg kg or our compound in suspension I.P. . The increase in lifespan of mice was found to be 224 even when the treatment started at a very advanced stage of tumor growth i.e., treatment started on the 18th day while the control died on the 20th day .
