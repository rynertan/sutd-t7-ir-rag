# Wheel slip control system.

## Abstract
A wheel slip control system having a vehicle speed detecting means for detecting a running speed of a vehicle a driving wheel rotating condition detecting means 29 for detecting an actual driving wheel rotating speed of the vehicle and an acceleration thereof an advance driving wheel speed computing means for calculating an advance driving wheel speed using as parameters the above actual driving wheel rotating speed and acceleration thereof a second throttle valve 14 provided in an intake passage in a position upstream or downstream of the position where a first throttle valve 10 interlocked with a vehicle accelerator pedal 9 is located a drive means 12 for opening and closing the second throttle valve and an opening closing control means 30 for determining a target throttle position on the basis of the detected vehicle running speed and the advance driving wheel speed and controlling the drive means so that an actual throttle position of the second throttle valve approaches the above target throttle position. According to above mentioned characteristic construction, it is possible to attain superior accelerability and controllabil ity, and the air fuel ratio and fuel consumption are held in good condition.
