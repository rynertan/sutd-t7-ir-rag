## Description
APPARATUS AND PROCESS FOR DISENGAGING GAS FROM GAS ENTRAINED ELECTROLYTE This invention relates to electrolytic cells for the production of gaseous products by the electrolysis of brines. More particularly, this invention relates to the separation of gases from liquid gas mixture produced in electrolytic cells. Modern electrolytic cells employing metallic electrodes having electrocatalytic coatings and separated by hydraulically impermeable ion exchange membranes are operated at high current densities and narrow interelectrode gaps to generate large amounts of gas and liquid products per unit of cell volume.In the upper portion of the cells, agas electrolyte mixture is produced which requires separation of the gaseous product from the electrolyte. This separation can be accomplished in a gas disengager apparatus which is connected to but separate from the electrolytic cell. To be efficient, a gas disengager should effectively separate the gaseous product from the electrolyte while minimizing foam generation and optimizing the size of the disengager. e Gas disengagers employed in electrolytic cells of the prior art include those of U.S. Patent No.1,855,732 issued to J. N. Smith, in which a mixture of water and oxygen or hydrogen contacts baffles which deflect both fluids downward onto a plurality of parallel screens through which the mixture percolates by gravity and a partial separation of the gas is achieved. The remaining gas separates when the electrolyte falls to the bottom of the disengager. Using this apparatus permits undesired contact between the gas and the disengaged liquid which results in re entrainment of the gas in the liquid. In addition, this apparatus requires a large container to accommodate the combination of baffles and screens, adding to the cost of gas disengagement. U.S. Patent No. 3,855,091 issued toL. W. Piester, teaches the separation of chlorine gas from a chlorine anolyte liquor froth by changing the momentum of the froth prior to discharging the froth into the disengager. This apparatus likewise maintains the separated gas in contact with the disengaged electrolyte and results in undesired re entrainment of the gas product in the electrolyte. There is a need for a gas disengager for electrolytic cells which efficiently separates a gas product from a gas entrained liquid while minimizing contact between the separated gas and the disengaged electrolyte. It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and proce ss which efficiently separates gas from a gas entrained electrolyte produced in an electrolytic cell while minimizing contact between the separated gas from the gas disengaged electrolyte. Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for separating gas from a gas entrained electrolyte produced in an electrolytic cell having increased cross sectional area without increasing the size of the disengager. These and other objects of the invention are accomplished in an apparatus for disengaging gas from a gas entrained electrolyte produced in an electrolytic cell for the electrolysis of brines which comprises a sealed container at least one inlet for discharging the gasentrained electrolyte from the electrolytic cell into the sealed container disengaging means for imparting a centrifugal force to the discharged gas entrained electrolyte to separate a gas from a gas disengaged electrolyte and outlets in the container for the gas and the gas disengaged electrolyte. The present invention also accomplishes these and other objects of the invention by providing a process for disengaging gas from a gasentrained electrolyte produced in an electrolytic cell for the electrolysis of brines which comprises discharging the gas entrained electrolyte from the electrolytic cell into a sealed container imparting a centrifugal force to the discharged gas entrained electrolyte by contacting a disengaging means with the discharged gas entrained electrolyte centrifugally separating a gas from a gasdisengaged electrolyte and removing the gas from the sealed container. Other advantages of the invention will become apparent up9n reading the description below and the invention will be better understood by reference to the attached drawings in which FIGURE 1 shows a side view of a monopolar filter press cell employing one embodiment of the disengaging means of the present invention. FIGURE 2 illustrates an end view of the embodiment of the disengager means of FIGURE 1 taken along line 2 2. FIGURE 3 represents a plan view of the embodiment of the disengager means of FIGURE 2. FIGURE 4 shows an enlarged schematic view of the disengager portion of FIGURE 1. FIGURE 5 illustrates an alternate embodiment of the disengaging means of the present invention. Monopolar filter press cell 60, illustrated in FIGURE 1, comprises a plurality of interleaved anode frames 24 and cathode frames 68 compressingly held between front end plate 62 and a rear end plate 64 by a plurality of tie bolts 69. Conductor rods 20 are bolted to anode collectors 50 to which electric current is supplied through anode terminals 52.Electrolysis of the electrolyte in anode frames 24 produces a gas containing anolyte which enters anolyte disengager 56 through outlets 42. Within anolyte disengager 56, the gas containing electrolyte contacts semicircular baffle 48. Semicircular baffle 48 centrifugally moves the gas containing electrolyte to separate the gas from the electrolyte, as best seen in FIGURE 2. The product gas is removed from anolyte disengager 56 through gas outlet 58. Gasdisengaged electrolyte is returned to anolyte frames 24 along with fresh anolyte supplied through anolyte feed pipe 54 through inlets 44. Cell 60 is supported on support legs 70 and is provided with an anolyte drain 46, Line 46 can be a valved drain line connected to the bottom member not shown of each of anode frame 24 by inlets 40 to allow anolyte to be drained. Alternatively, line 46 can be connected to anolyte disengager 56 in order to provide a recirculation path for disengaged anolyte liquid. In FIGURE 2, semicircular baffle 48 is bolted to outlets 42. Semicircular baffle 48 centrifugally separates the gas from the gas containing electrolyte from a plurality of outlets 42, as shown in FIGURE 3. FIGURE 4 depicts anolyte disengager saOvnU outlets 42 through which gas containing anolyte is discharged against semicircular baffle 48. Disengaged liquid is removed from anolyte disengager 56 through conduit 57. Gas released is removed from anolyte disengager 56 through gas outlet 58. Semicircular baffle 48 centrifugally separates the gas from the gas containing electrolyte, as shown in FIGURE 2, by directing the denser liquid along the curvature of semicircular baffle 48 towards area B.The disengaged gas which collects in area A, flows along the length of semicircular baffle 48 and out the ends, as shown in FIGURE 4. FIGURE 5 shows an alternate embodiment in which anolyte disengager 72 has two curved surfaces 74 joined along inner edges 76. Gas containing anolyte discharged through outlet 42 is centrifugally separated along curved surfaces 74, the disengaged gas being removed through gas outlet 58. More in detail, the novel apparatus and process of the present invention may be used with any gas entrained electrolyte produced in an electrolytic cell including gas entrained anolytes or gas entrained catholytes. Suitable anolytes include alkali metal halides or alkaline earth metal halides where the halides are chloride or bromides and the entrained gas is chlorine or bromine. Also suitabie as anolytes are water or alkaline solutions in which oxygen is the entrained gas. Preferred anolytes are alkali metal chlorides where the alkali metal is sodium or potassium. These anolytes are referred to as brine in the description and claims. Gas entrained catholytes include water or alkaline solutions such as alkali metal hydroxides or alkaline earth metal hydroxides in which hydrogen is the entrained gas. The gas entrained electrolytes may be produced in a variety of electrolytic cells including monopolar or bipolar cells which employ liquid permeable diaphragms or ion permeable membranes as separators. Preferred electrolytic cells are filter press celXs and in particular monopolar filter press cells of the type disclosed in the European patent aDnli ation 81 100 967.9 entitled Membrane Electrode Pack AlkaliChlorine Cell , filed February 11, 1981, said patent application being incorporated herein by reference. Monopolar filter press cells of the type disclosed inEuropean patent application 81 100 967.9 comprise a plurality of interleaved anode frames and cathode frames which are compressingly held between two end plates by a plurality of tie bolts.The electrodes have horizontally oriented conductors which permit the construction of electrodes having a height of from about 1 to about 5 meters while maintaining a short direct current path through the cell.When used, for example, in electrolyzing alkali metal chloride brines such as sodium chloride, chlorine gas is produced in the anode frames. The chlorine gas bubbles produced rise up through the anode chamber to form in the upper portions a chlorine entrained sodium chloride brine containing up to about 30 percent by volume of the gas. This chlorine entrained brine passes through outlets in the top of the anode frame and through conduits of the type shown in FIGURES 1 3 into the gas disengager. Within the gas disengager is a gas disengaging means which, when impinged upon by the chlorine entrained brine, imparts a centrifugal force to the fluid. This centrifugal force causes a separation by density of the chlorine gas from the liquid brine.For example, using the semicircular gas disengaging means shown in FIGURES 1 4, the denser liquid brine flows around the curved surface and down the side of the gas disengaging means while the gas remains under the curved portion, flowing along the disengaging means and being discharged at the ends of the disengaging means. By imparting a centrifugal force to the gasentrained electrolyte, the gas and the electrolyte are separated in a manner which minimizes contact between the separated gas and the disengaged electrolyte and eliminates or substantially prevents re entrainment of the gas by the disengaged electrolyte. The disengaging means may be any surface capable of imparting a centrifugal force to the gasentrained electrolyte. For example, surfaces having a curvature of at least 45 degrees and preferably of from about 100 to about 180 degrees are suitably used. While the embodiment of FIGURES 2 and 5 show the conduit discharging the gas entrained electrolyte tangentially by being located adjacent to one side of the.disengaging means, separation of the gas from the electrolyte may be attained, by, for example, placing the conduit so that the gas entrained electrolyte is discharged at the center of the curved surface. As shown in FIGURE 2, the gas disengaging means is attached, for example, by bolting to the conduits for discharging the gas entrained electrolyte.However, the gas disengaging means may be attached to, for example, walls of the sealed container by any suitable means. Any container such as a tank may be used as the sealed container. Employing the novel apparatus for gasdisengaging of the present invention provides increased cross sectional area for disengagement of the gas from the electrolyte without having to increase the volume or size of the sealed container. The novel process for disengaging gas from a gas entrained electrolyte of the present invention results in efficient separation of the gas from the electrolyte while minimizing contact between the gas and the gas disengaged electrolyte which would result in re entrainment of the gas.
