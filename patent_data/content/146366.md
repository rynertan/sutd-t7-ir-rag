# A rotary mower.

## Abstract
A rotary mower 10 which is preferably of the twin disc type is described, the mower being particularly suitable for agricultural use. The mower includes a support frame 11 for mounting on a prime mover and preferably at least includes two blade carrying discs 14 mounted on the frame for rotation about spaced vertical axes 12, 13 . Each disc is mounted so that it may move along its respective axis of rotation and thereby float according to changing ground contour.
