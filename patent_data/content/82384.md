## Description
A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF IS 4 RYDROXYPHENYL BIPRENYL DISULFONE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Bis 4 hydroxyphenyl biphenyl disulfone has been found to be a useful monomer in preparing polymers such as polyurethanes, polycarbonates, polyethers, polyesters and polysulfones. Polycarbonates prepared using such a mononer are disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,269,986. Such polymers are generally useful for the preparation of films or fibers and for injection molded or extruded parts, blow molded articles and coatings. Huismann, in U.S. Patent 2,288,282, discloses see Example 8 of that patent an alternative method for the preparation of the disulfone of the present invention. There, a hydrolysis of the intermediate diphenyl 4,4 bis 4 chlorophenylsulphone is carried out in a methyl alcohol hydroxide solution and results in a mixture comprising a relatively low amount of the bis 4 hydroxyphenyl diphenyl disulfone. The object of the present invention is to provide a novel process for the preparation of bis 4 hydroxyphenyl biphenyl disulfone. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention pertains to a process for the preparation of bis 4 hydroxyphenyl biphenyl disulfone comprising reacting 4,41 biphenyldisulfonyl chloride with monochlorobenzene in the presence of ferric chloride, dimethylsulfoxide and aqueous sodium hydroxide. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The process of the present invention alay be represented by the following general reaction scheme EMI2.1 Fez13 dimethylsulfoxide 1300C aqueous NaOH, 1300CEMI2.2 in one embodiment of the present invention, the process is carried out in two basic steps and may be represented by the following general reaction scheme EMI2.3 direthylsulfoxide aqueous NaOH, 1300CEMI2.4 Upon the completion of the synthesis, the bis 4 hydroxyphenyl biphenyl disulfone is recovered as a precipitate and is then separated, washed, dried and optionally then recrystallized. The process of the invention generally produces high quality bis 4 hydroxyphenyl biphenyl disulfone in yields of from about 40 to 50 , based on the theoretical yield. The invention will be further illustrated, but is not intended to be limited, by the following examples. EXAMPLESEXAMPLE 1 One Flask Procedure A three necked 12 liter flask was equipped with a stirrer, condenser, heating mantle, thermometer and a nitrogen purge. The outlet was connected to a bubbler water or NaOH solution to absorb the HC1 evolved. The flask was purged with nitrogen.4,4 Biphenyldisulfonylchloride 1756 g, 5 moles , monochlorobenzene 3 liters, 29.6 moles and anhydrous ferric chloride 81.0 g, 0.5 mole were charged to the flask. The mixture was stirred, warmed to 130 C i2 C and maintained at this temperature for 15 20 hours.Dimethylsulfoxide 2 liters was added, the pot temperature raised to 1700C and the monochlorobenzene distilled 2 liters . An additinal 2 liters of dimethylsulfoxide and 50 sodium hydroxide 4,000 g, 50 moles were then added. The mixture was ref fluxed for at least 20 hours. The contents of the flask were poured into 10 liters of water and 100 g of celite added. This mixture was stirred and allowed to settle. Most of the liquid was decanted from the solids, and the remaining slurry filtered through a 1 4 pad of celite. The liquid was added dropwise to a vigorously stirred solution of 10 HC1. The solid was collected with suction, washed with 5 liters of 20 acetone in water, 5 liters of water and air dried to give a 93 yield of crude bis 4 hydroxyphenyl biphenyl disulfone.The identity of the material was confirmed by its IR spectrum. The material was purified in the following manner Crude bis 4 hydroxyphenyl biphenyl disulfone 200 g was treated with 500 ml toluene and 400 ml ethyl acetate. This mixture was heated to 100 1100C, and the upper layer was decanted from the lower darker layer and was filtered. The solvent was removed and the residue recrystallized from acetic acid 50 recovery . The off white to grey solid was analyzed to be 95 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl biphenyl disulfone by thin layer chromotography.EXAMPLE 2 Two Step Procedure A three necked, 12 liter flask was equipped with a stirrer, condenser, heating mantle, thermometer, and a nitrogen purge. The outlet was connected to a bubbler water or NaOH solution to absorb the HC1 evolved. The flask was purged with nitrogen, and monochlorobenzene 7.8 liters, 77 moles and 4,4 biphenyldisulfonylchloride 2.27 kg, 6.5 moles , was charged to the flask. The mixture was heated to 70 C and anhydrous ferric chloride 65 g, 0.4 mole added. The reaction mixture was then heated to 130 C and maintained at 130 i 2 C for 20 hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature, and the product collected with suction. The crude yield was 84 .This material was crystallized from dimethyl formarnide 80 recovery to yield white crystals M.P. 269 272 C of bis 4 chlorophenyl biphenyl disulfone. To a 12 liter three necked flask fitted with a stirrer, a thermometer, a condenser, an addition funnel and a gas inlet and outlet, was added 10 liters of dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO and 1 kg 1.99 moles of bis 4 chlorophenyl biphenyl disulfone. A slow stream of nitrogen was passed through the apparatus. The reaction mixture was heated to 70 C until the bis 4 chlorophenyl biphenyl disulfone was completely in solution 1 hour . 50 Sodium hydroxide 1.6 kg was added dropwise in 1 hour, and the color of the reaction mixture changed. After the addition of the sodium hydroxide was complete, the temperature of the reaction mixture was raised to 130 140 C and held at this temperature for 18 hours.After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was diluted with 30 liters of distilled water and was acidified to pH 6.The precipitate thus separated was filtered, washed and dried at 1300C under vacuum. The crude product 752 g 81Z yield was recrystallized from glacial acetic acid 50 recovery as white powdery bis 4 hydroxyphenyl biphenyl disulfone M.P. 242 2430C . COMPARISON EXAMPLE The procedure described in U.S. Patent 2,288,282 Example 8 was followed as described below A mixture of a solution of 44.8 g of potassium hydroxide in about 6 ml of water and 100 g of methanol and 50.3 g of bis 4 chlorophenyl sulfonyl biphenyl in an autoclave was heated at 150 to 1550C for 12 hours. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool whereupon the potassium salts separated were removed by filtration.The filtrate was evaporated. The evaporated residue was taken in water. This residue was not soluble in water indicating the formation partly of compound which is not a phenolic potassium salt. On pouring the diluted reaction mixture into an excess of dilute hydrochloric acid, a product 22.8 g with melting point 114 121 was obtained. NMR spectra of the product indicates significant formation of methoxy analogs methoxy or dimethoxy of the biphenyl of interest.
