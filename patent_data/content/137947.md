# Spin dryer.

## Abstract
A spin dryer including a rotary stage 12 for supporting a substrate 1 to be dried, particularly adapted for use in producing semiconductor devices, and a stationary cover 11 spaced from the substrate 1 . The stationary cover has at least the same area as that of the substrate and is provided with a number of openings for charging a dry and dust free gas onto the substrate, whereby oxidation and dust contamination of the substrate are avoided.
