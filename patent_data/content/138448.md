# Method for producing a self contained pressure sensitive copying material involving the removal of free formaldehyde from a formaldehyde containing suspension of microcapsules.

## Abstract
Free formaldehyde is removed from a formaldehyde con taining suspension of microcapsules by the addition of a com pound having a B dicarbonyl group or a cyclic ketone. The thus treated microcapsules are particularly suitable for the production of self contained pressure sensitive copying material in which the image generating reactants are present in a single coating composition.
