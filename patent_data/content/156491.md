## Description
FORMATION OF FINE PARTICLE SINTERABLE CERAMIC POWDERS This invention relates to making metal oxide or other metal oxygen containing ceramic precursor powders that are readily compacted and sintered into strong, dense, bodies. More specifically, it relates to a precipitation method that is very effective in forming such precursor powders. Many useful articles of commerce are made by pressing together suitable powders and sintering or firing the pressed body to form a strong, dense article. In this practice it is necessary to start with particles that can be pressed and sintered into a relatively high density, fine grain body. Good sinterability of ceramic powders requires fine particle size and fairly uniform particle shape.After compacting such powder the green body contains uniform small particles with small even voids and a relatively high green density. These compacted powders sinter well. Traditionally, mixtures of suitable metal oxide precursor materials have been pulverized to obtain a fine particle size, for example, less than lrm. Fracturing relatively large particles into small ones produces a wide particle size distribution and irregular shaped particles that compact with large irregular voids. Such materials have to be fired to relatively high temperatures to consolidate the body and achieve adequate density. Chemical precipitation of ceramic precursor materials has also been practiced. Here, water soluble salts of the metal or metals of interest are treated with a base to precipitate the respective hydroxides. Precipitated hydroxides usually contain particles having high surface areas, but electron micrographs show them to consist of irregular shaped flakes that do not sinter well. U.S. patent 4,065,544 bawling and Naumann disloses a method of contacting precursor metal compounds with solid carbohydrate materials or liquid dispersions thereof to form an intimate mixture. The mixture is then ignited to decompose the carbohydrate and to produce agglomerates of fine metal oxygencontaining particles. The mass that is ignited contains the anions initially associated with the metals. It also contains any other materials entrained with the carbohydrate. There remains a need for an efficient method of producing readily compactible and sinterable ceramic precursor powders. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method of precipitating metal and oxygen containing materials that can be processed into precursor powder capable of being readily compacted and sintered into dense, strong, ceramic bodies. It is a more specific object of this invention to provide a method of making such sinterable powder by initially precipitating divalent or higher valence metal ions from aqueous solution with a suitable polymeric acid. Summary of the Invention In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, these and other objects and advantages are accomplished as follows. An aqueous solution of a suitable salt of one or more desired metals is prepared. A suitable water soluble poly acrylic acid is selected. A poly acrylic acid having a molecular weight of about 5,000 is preferred because it readily forms aqueous solutions of suitable viscosity for processing hereunder. This acid is preferably neutralized with ammonium hydroxide. The solution of metal salt and the neutralized poly acrylic acid solution are rapidly mixed. A precipitate, typically white, forms. The precipitate is separated from the mother liquor by filtering or by centrifuging. The precipitate can be washed with water to remove soluble salts formed in the double decomposition reaction. The precipitate is dried and then heated to burn out organic material and leave an ash of metal oxide or other metal and oxygen containing compounds.The ash is then calcined, if necessary, at a suitable elevated temperature to form the desired metal oxide precursor material or the reaction product of two or more metal oxides. The calcined material is made up of a relatively loose agglomeration of fine, relatively uniformly sized particles. The calcined product may be ball milled to produce a very fine, uniformly sized particle mixture that can be pressed and sintered into a dense, strong, ceramic body. The above described practice can be used to precipitate water soluble salts of divalent and higher valence metals. For example, the practice has been used in producing dense, strong bodies of yttria stabilized zirconia, yttria, alumina, titania, barium titanate and lead titanate. Other embodiments and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from a detailed description thereof, which follows. A poly acrylic acid precipitating agent is used that is soluble in water to form a solution of suitable viscosity for precipitating useful ceramic precursor materials. An example of a suitable poly acrylic acid is one having a molecular weight of about 5,000. A material currently produced by B.F. Goodrich Company and designated Goodrite K 732 is an example of such a suitable material. As is known, the repeating unit in the acrylic acid polymer is EMI4.1 Thus, the polyacrylic acid has upwards of 70 pendant acid groups in its polymer chains. When an aqueous solution of a divalent, trivalent or tetravalent metal is added to the solution of the polymeric acid or its ammonium salt, the polyvalent cations crosslink along two or more chains to form a water insoluble organic salt.The poly acid solution is fairly acid, and with most metals it is preferable to first neutralize the acid with concentrated ammonium hydroxide to form the ammonium salt of the poly acrylic acid .Whether the soluble metal salt is precipitated with polyacrylic acid or a suitable salt thereof, it has been found that the resulting precipitate is extremely useful in the preparation of excellent precursor materials for the production of sintered ceramic bodies. Example 1 Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Zirconyl acetate 225 grams was dissolved in one litre of water. Separately, 344 grams poly acrylic acid Goodrite K 732, B.F. GoodrichCo. was neutralized with 126 millilitres of concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide. The neutralized mixture was diluted with water to a total volume of 3 litres. The zirconyl acetate solution was added to the ammonium polyacrylate solution with rapid mixing. A white precipitate formed. The precipitate is a product of the double decomposition reaction between zirconyl acetate and ammonium polyacrylate to form zirconyl polyacrylate and ammonium acetate. The precipitate is separated by filtering or centrifuging. The precipitate is quite water insoluble and may be repeatedly washed with water to remove ammonium acetate and other water soluble impurities. The precipitate was then dried at 1000C and ignited at 4000C to burn out the organic material. The ash was then calcined at 8000C for one hour. The product is zirconia, ZrO2, and microscopic examination revealed that it is in the form of an agglomeration of small, relatively uniformly sized particles. The calcined material was ball milled for 6 hours others up to 24 hours in water, using alumina mill media. The milled product was dried and screened through 100 mesh screens. This powder had a surface area of 11 m2 g. The 24 hour mill powder had a surface area of 12 m2 g. To 100 grams of the screened ZrO2 powder was added 4 grams of a precipitated yttria as Y OH 3. This mixture was further mixed by ball milling in water for 2 hours using alumina mill media. The mixture was then dried and forced through a 100 mesh screen. The zirconia yttria mixture approximately 2.5 mole percent yttria was pressed into physical test slabs measuring 6.35 cm long x 0.95 cm wide x 0.47 cm thick at 137,895 kPa 20,000 psi. . The green slabs were sintered 5 hours in air at 1,3200C. X ray analysis of the slabs indicated a crystal structure that was mainly tetragonal with a minor amount of monoclinic phase. The sintered material had a density of 5.63 grams per cc, and a train size of O.l2pm. The strength of the sintered slabs was measured by determining its modulus of rupture hereinafter sometimes referred to as MOR in a 4 point deflection test. This is a known test in which a force is applied to the upper surface of the slab. The force is distributed between two points spaced 12.7 mm 1 2 inch apart A . The slab is supported on its bottom surface at two points spaced 25.4 mm one inch apart L .The modulus of rupture was calculated using the following general formula Modulus of Rupture 3 x Breaking Force x L A 2 x Width of Slab x Thickness of Slab 2The representative modulus of rupture of the yttria partially stabilized zirconia slabs prepared by this example was 656 MPa 95,000 psi . The properties of sintered ZrO2 2.5 mole percent Y203 slabs, prepared in accordance with this example, were compared with slabs pressed and sintered the same way from three commercially available yttria containing zirconia powder samples of the same composition. The strongest slabs were produced from a commercially available material with the trade designation Zircar . It had the following properties X Ray Analysis Tetragonal Crystal Structure Density 5.15 g cc Fired Grain Size 0.20 m MOR Strength 69,190 psi 477 MPa The zirconia powder produced by the method of the present invention produced a stronger, more dense body than that produced by the most favorable of other powders of the same composition. Example 2 Coprecipitated Zirconia Plus 2.5 Mole Percent yttria Zirconyl acetate 219.4 grams and yttrium chloride hexahydrate 7.6 grams were dissolved in one litre of water. A 3 litre aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide neutralized polyacrylic acid was prepared as in Example 1. The aqueous solution of metal salts was added to the ammonium polyacrylate solution with rapid mixing.The precipitate was filtered from the mother liquor and washed with water. It was dried at 1000C and the organic material burned out at 4000C. The ash was calcined at 8000C for one hour. 100 grams of the calcined material was ball milled dry using alumina milling media and 3 grams of a 2 1 mix ofCarbowax Thixcin. The mixture was milled for 20 hours. The surface area of the powder was 12.5 m2 g. The mill product was then screened through a 100 mesh screen and pressed into physical test slabs as in Example 1 at 68947 kPa 10,000 psi .The slabs were sintered in air at 1,4180C for 10 hours. The test slabs had the following properties Density 5.81 g cc X Ray Tetragonal Major Monoclinic Minor 200 x 10 10 m. powder particle size determined by x ray line broadening MOR Strength 711.8 MPa 103,200 psE A dense, strong body was thus formed from the coprecipitated powder at a modest sintering temperature. Example 3 Yttria Y203 Yttrium chloride hexahydrate YC13 6H2O, 303 grams was dissolved in one litre of water.Poly acrylic acid , as in Example 1 516 grams , was neutralized with 189 millilitres concentrated ammonium hydroxide and diluted to 3 litres total volume with water. The yttrium chloride solution was added to the ammonium polyacrylate with rapid mixing, and a white precipitate formed. The precipitate was filtered from the mother liquor and washed with water. It was dried at 1000C and the 0 organic material then burned out at 400 C. The ash was then calcined at 1,1000C for one hour.Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that complete weight loss occurred at 1,1000C. Samples calcined below l,l000c broke apart during subsequent sintering. The calcined product was ball milled in water using alumina mill media for 20 hours. The mill product was dried and screened through 100 mesh. The surface area of the powder was 12 square metres per gram. The powder was then pressed at 137895 kPa 20,000 psi into test cylinders using an isostatic press. Pressed cylinders with a diameter of 1.7 cm and a length of 1.7 cm were then sintered in air for one hour at various temperatures to determine a suitable sintering temperature for approaching the theoretical density of the material. Cylinders having a density of about 995 of theoretical density were obtained by sintering for one hour at temperatures of 1,600 to 1,7000C. The achievement of such a high density in sintered yttria at such a relatively low temperature is remarkable. A commercial yttria pressed and sintered under the same conditions achieved a density of only about 80 of theoretical density. A recent publication, Ceramic Bulletin, AmericanCeramic Society, Vol. 62, No. 4 1983 , pp. 510 512, reported yttria bodies achieving a relative density of 99 percent of theoretical density only after sintering at much higher temperatures of the order of 2,2000C. Example 4 Alumina A12O3 Aluminium trichloride hexahydrate 241.4 grams was dissolved in one litre of water.Poly acrylic acid , as in Example 1 516 grams , was neutralized with 126 millilitres concentrated ammonium hydroxide and diluted to 3 litres with water. The aluminium chloride solution was added with rapid stirring to the ammonium polyacrylate solution, and a white precipitate formed. The white precipitate was dried at 1000C and the organic material burned out at 4000C. The ash was calcined 0 at 1,050 C. X ray analysis of the calcined product showed a 50 conversion to alpha alumina. The calcined product was ball milled for 16 hours in water using aluminium mill media. The mill product was dried and screened through 100 mesh. The surface area of the powder was 21 square metres per gram. Test disks, 1.27 cm in diameter, were uniaxially pressed from the powder at 137895 kPa 20,000 psi .Various disks were sintered in air at different sintering temperatures. Disks sintered for one hour at about 1,5500C had a density of about 96 of theoretical density. Example 5 Titania TiO2 Titanium tetrachloride 327 millilitres was added to 2 litres of ice water with rapid stirring. The titanium tetrachloride reacts with the water to form titanyl chloride solution and hydrochloric acid. Poly acrylic acid , as inExample 1 688 grams , was neutralized with 252 millilitres of concentrated ammonium hydroxide and diluted to 3 litres with water. The titanium chloride solution was added to the ammonium polyacrylate with rapid stirring. A titanyl polyacrylate precipitate formed. It was filtered from the mother liquor and washed with water. The precipitate was dried at 1000C and the organic portion burned out at 4000C. The ash was calcined at 8000C for one hour. X ray analysis of the calcined product indicated complete conversation to the rutile phase of titania. The calcined product was wet ground in a ball mill, using alumina balls, for 16 hours. The milled product was dried and screened through 100 mesh. It then had a surface area of 8 square metres per gram. The powder was pressed at 137895 kPa 20,000 psi into a number of test disks, as in Example 4. The disks were sintered in air at varying temperatures. It was found that the disks could be sintered at only 1,200 to l,3000C and achieve a density in excess of 95 of theoretical density. Example 6 Barium Titanate In this example it was necessary to prepare a titanyl nitrate solution. This was done as follows. Titanium IV i propoxide 284 grams was added to one litre of water to precipitate titanyl hydroxide. The titanyl hydroxide precipitate was dissolved by the addition of nitric acid to form titanyl nitrate ETiO NO3 2. This solution was kept cold. Barium acetate 255.4 grams was dissolved in the titanyl nitrate solution. Poly acrylic acid , as in Example 1 688 grams , was neutralized with 252 millilitres of concentrated ammonium hydroxide. This mixture was diluted to 3 litres with water. The barium acetatetitanyl nitrate solution was added with rapid mixing to the ammonium polyacrylate solution. A white precipitate formed. It was filtered from the mother liquor, dried at 1000C and the organic material burned out at 400 C. 0 The ash was calcined at 800 C for one hour. X ray analysis indicated complete conversion of the precursor materials to BaTiO3. The barium titanate powder was ball milled wet for 16 hours as in the previous examples. The mill product was dried and screened through 100 mesh. The powder had a surface area of 5 square metres per gram. The mill product was pressed at 137895 kPa 20,000 psi into a number of test disks like those in the previous examples. The test disks were sintered at increasing temperatures. It was found that sintering in air at temperatures of 1,250 to 1,3000C produced sintered bodies having a density of about 95 of the density of the theoretical density of barium titanate. It was found that commercially available barium titanate powders required sintering at temperatures of 1,350 to 1,4000C to achieve like densities. Example 7 Lead Titanate PbTiO3 A cold titanyl nitrate solution was prepared following the procedure described in the above example by starting with 284 grams of titanium IV i propoxride. Lead acetate trihydrate 379.3 grams was dissolved in the titanyl nitrate solution. Poly acrylic acid , like that in the previous examples 688 grams , was neutralized with 252 millilitres of concentrated ammonium hydroxide and diluted to a volume of 3 litres with water. The solution of the metal salts was added to the ammonium polyacrylate solution with rapid mixing. A white precipitate formed. The precipitate was filtered from the mother liquor, dried at 1000C and the organic material burned out at 400 0C. X ray analysis showed almost complete conversion to lead titanate at this temperature. Thus, treatment of an aqueous solution of one or more polyvalent metal salts with poly acrylic acid or Ammonium polyacrylate provides several advantages to one who wishes to make strong, dense, ceramic articles. A metal polyacrylate precipitate forms which is readily separable from the mother liquor and can be washed clean of extraneous ions.It is dried and the organic portion of the precipitate burned off. The resulting ash can be calcined if necessary to form finely divided particles of metal oxide or other desired metal oxygen compositions. The particles are generally spherical and of substantially uniform size. The calcined product can be pressed into a body of desired configuration and sintered at a suitable, relatively low temperature to form a dense, strong body. The sintering temperature required on the pressed material resulting by practice of the process of the present invention is no higher than, and is usually lower than, sintering temperatures required using powders produced by other means. In most instances it will be preferred to use the ammonium salt or its equivalent, e.g., an amine salt of poly acrylic acid , as the precipitating agents. Most metal polyacrylate salts are less soluble in ammonium solutions than the acid solutions. In the above examples the precipitate was washed free of the ammonium salt, e.g., ammonium chloride, acetate or nitrate. This is desirable, but not necessary. The ammonium salts will volatilize at 4000C when the organic content is burned out. While the invention has been described in terms of a few specific examples thereof, it will be appreciated that other forms could readily be adapted by one skilled in the art. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is to be considered limited only by the following claims.
