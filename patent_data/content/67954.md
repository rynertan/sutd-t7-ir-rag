Selenium, in particular, has a disadvantage regarding the toxicity.On the other hand, organic photoconductive materials are exemplified by condensed polycyclic aromatic compounds such as anthracene, pyrene and pelyrene heterocyclic compounds such as pyrazoline derivatives, imidazole derivatives and oxazole derivatives and polymeric compounds such as poly N vinylcarbazole and polyvinylanthracene. These are superior to the above mentioned inorganic photoconductive materials having regard to transparency, flexibility, light weight, film forming property, smooth surface and price, hence have extensively been studied for the recent years.Photosensitive materials containing an organic photoconductive compound, however, have mostly quite a poor photosensitivity as compared with those containing an inorganic photoconductive material such as selenium and zinc oxide, hence only a few of them are practically employed. One of them comprises poly N vinylcarbazole PVK , chemically sensitized with 2,4,7 trinitro 9fluorenone TNF .Although it is a photoconductive material having superior properties such as photosensitivity, darkdecay rate, stability and reproducibility, it has a disadvantage owing to the toxicity of TNF.Further attempts have been made to improve photosensitivity by the combination of an organic photoconductive compound and a dye sensitizer.

Namely, the object of the invention is to provide organic photoconductive materials having a high sensitivity, low darkdecay rate, well reproducible photosensitivity after repeated use over a long period of time, and good safety or low toxicity.According to the invention, there are provided organic photoconductive compositions for electrophotography comprising a polymer having molecular weight of from 103 to 106 containing as main unit s an acrylic acid ester derivative and or methacrylic acid ester derivative represented by the following general formula EMI3.1 wherein, R represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group m is an integer of from 1 to 3 and n is an integer of from 1 to 3 and an electron donor.The polymer to be employed in the present invention having chiefly the units of formula I may be prepared by way of block polymerization or suspension polymerization of an acrylic or methacrylic acid ester derivative represented by the following general formula II , solely or in combination, optionally in the further presence of other unsaturated copolymerizable ethylenic monomer EMI3.2 wherein, R, m and n have the meaning defined above .

Copolymeriza tin with such monomer will improve such properties of polymers as film forming property, flexibility and adhesion to substrates. The amount of such copolymerizable monomer in copolymer produced should preferably be kept up to 20 molar percent in view of photoconductivity.Electorn donars to be employed in the present invention may be exemplified by tetrathiotetracene and derivatives thereof tetrathionaphthalene and derivatives thereof tetraselenotetracene and derivatives thereof tetraselenonaphthalene and derivatives thereof condensed ring compounds such as anthracene and pyrene hydroquinone tetraiodohydroquinone and nitrogen containing compounds such as benzophenothiazine, phenothiazine, benzidine, tetramethylbenzidine, aniline, dimethylaniline, pphenylenediamine, tetramethyl p phenylenediamine, 2methyl p phenylenediamine, N,N2 dimethyl p phenylene diamine, durenediamine, p diaminodiphenylamine, diaminonaphthalenes, diaminopyrenes, 2 aminofluorene, dialkylaminostyrenes and quinoline.The ratio of blending the polymer and the electron donar is preferably from 1 to 10 moles of the former based on 1 mole of the latter, when calculated in terms of the monomer I that constitutes the polymer.Presence of one mole or less of the polymer will result in a poor film forming property of the composition, whereas presence of 10 moles or more thereof will result in a poor photoconductive property due to an insufficient formation of the charge transfer complex.The compositions according to the invention may contain a binder resin, if necessary.

Incorporation into the composition of such a binder resin should preferably be kept at 10 percent or less based on the composition in order to attain a good photoconductivity.In order to prepare the photoconductive compositions for electrophotography according to the present invention, a solution of a polymer, an electron donor, and a binder resin if required, at a suitable mixing rate is coated on a conductive support such as aluminium plate, then dried.The coating solution may be prepared by various ways.For example, a polymer and an electron donar are dissolved in a suitable solvent, while a binder resin is dissolved in the same or different kinds of solvent, and finally the both solutions are blended. Such solvents include, for instance, benzene, trichlorobenzene, nitrobenzene, acetone, methanol, methylene chloride, trichloroethylene, carbon tetrachloride, methyl cellosolve, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide andN methylpyrrolidone. The amount of the organic photoconductive composition of the present invention to be coated on a support is not critical. Usually, it is coated on a support so that a dried film having a 1 to 30 p thickness may be obtained.In order for the thus prepared photosensitive material to be applied for electrophotography, the photoconductive layer comprising the photosensitive material may be processed according to the conventional electrophotographic processes such as electrification, imagewise exposure and development transfer.The organic photoconductive compositions for electrophotography according to the invention described above have a superior photosensitivity, at the visible range, which is comparable to that of the known poly N vinylcarbazole chemically sensitized with 2,4,7 trinitro9 fluorenone, have a low darkdecay rate and a good stability that allows to produce images having a superior reproducibility even after the repeated use over a long period of time. Further, the materials to be employed have no toxicity and therefore may be used safely.The present invention will be explained by the following working examples which by no means limit the scope of the invention.Example 1.A mixture of 5.0 g of p nitrobenzyl methacrylate, 0.5 g of azobisisobutyronitrile, 2.0 g of poly vinyl alcohol and 100 mQ of water was refluxes, with stirring, at 90 950C for 1 hour under nitrogen stream. After allowing to cool to room temperature, precipitates were collected by filtration and the solid product was washed with a warm water and dried. The product was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and reprecipitated with methanol. Yield, 3.6 g 72 Number average molecular weight, 150,000 gel permeation chromatography with a standard poly styrene NMR THF d8 6 2.20 s, CH3 , 4.21 4.85 b. CH2 , 6.65 7.40 m, phenyl Glass transition point, 1080C. 1 g of the thus prepared polymer and 0.8 g of anthracene were dissolved in 100 mQ of tetrahydrofuran to give a uniform solution, which was coated on Mylar Trademark for a polyester film on which aluminium had been vacuum evaporated to give a thickness of 2 8 um and dried.Electrification and decay of the film thus prepared were determined with an electrostatic paper analyzer. The result was 7.0 lux sec. when the sensitivity was represented in terms of exposure amount unit lux sec. necessary for the initial surface electric charge to be decayed by 1 2. The photosensitive films prepared were subjected to repeated electrification and exposure 5,000 times in the same conditions as above, after which almot the same results were obtained, thus suggesting the superior reproducibility and stability.Example 2.1 g of the polymer employed in Example 1 and 0.1 g of tetrathiotetracene were dissolved in a 1 1 mixture of toluene and trichlorobenzene, and the solution was coated on Mylar on which aluminium had been vacuum evaporated, and dried. Measurement of the sensitivity of the film thus prepared performed in the similar manner as in the above mentioned Example showed the value 6.8 lux sec. The film was then subjected to repeated electrification and exposure 5,000 times in the similar manner as in the above mentioned Example, after which about the same result as that of the initial stage was obtained, thus showing the absence of fatigue that would affect practical use.As specifically described above, the novel organic photoconductive compositions according to the present invention possess superior electrification properties such as low darkdecay rate, as well as superior photosensitive properties such as low half life exposure amount. Such superior properties may be maintained during and after their use over a long period of time. Example 3.A mixture of 5.0 g of 3,5 dinitrobenzyl methacrylate, 0.5 g of azobisisobutyronitrile, 2.0 g of poly vinyl alcohol and 100 mQ of water was reacted in the similar manner as in Example 1 to give a polymer. Yield, 3.0 g 60 Number average molecular weight, 186,000 gel permeation chromatography with a standard poly styrene NMR THF d8 6 2.50 s, CH3 , 4.20 5.05 b, CH2 , 7.71 7.98 m, phenyl Glass transition point, 1120C. 1 g of the polymer thus obtained and 0.1 g of tetrathiotetracene were dissolved in a 1 1 mixture of toluene and trichlorobenzene, and the solution was coated on Mylar on which aluminium had been vacuum evaporated, and dried. Sensitivity measurement of the film thus obtained in the similar manner as in the above mentioned Example showed the value 6.6 lux sec.The films prepared were subjected to repeated electrification and exposure 5,000. times in the similar manner as in the above mentioned Example, after which about the same result as that of the initial stage was obtained, thus showing the absence of fatigue that would affect practical use.Comparative Example 1In comparison with the photosensitive film of the invention, 0.8 g of PVK and 1 g of TNF were dissolved in 18 mQ of o dichlorobenzene to give a uniform solution, which was coated on Mylar on which aluminium had been vacuum evaporated to give a thickness of 3 10 pm, and dried. In the same manner as in Example 1, the sensitivity measurement of the PVK TNF film was performed. The result was 7.0 lux sec. This film was subjected to repeated electrification and exposure in the same conditions as above, but, after 1,000 time repetitions, abnormality was observed.As seen from the foregoing, the photosensitive film according to the invention, having no toxicity as in the case of the PVK TNF film, has a good photoconductivity comparable to that of the PVK TNF film, and has far better reproducibility over a long period of time than the PVK TNF film.
