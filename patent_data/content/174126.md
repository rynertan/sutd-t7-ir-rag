## Abstract
For use with a vehicle seat belt guide comprising a mounting plate 5,6 secured around one side portion of an elongate running loop 1 , there is provided a cover 15 having a portion which makes a snap fit over the other portion 4 of the loop to provide a larger radius running surface to be engaged by the belt and a portion which encloses the mounting plate and makes a snap fit therewith. The cover can provide a tongue portion 22 which restricts the area of the loop to resist folding of the belt.
