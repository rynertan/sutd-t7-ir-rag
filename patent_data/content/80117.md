## Description
TITLE OF THE InventionEnantiomers of trans Indeno 1,2 b 1,4 oxazines, process for their preparation and pharmaceutical formulation containing them.BACKGROUND OF TIC INVENTION This invention is concerned with the enantiomers of trans 2,3,4,4a,5,9b hexahydroindeno 1,2 b 1,4 oxazines of structural formula I which is used in this disclosure to depict the racemic, S,S and R,R enantiomers unless specific entity is meant in which case it is specified to be racemic, or one of the optical isomers.EMI1.1 The R,R enantiomer demonstrates the docaminergic activity of antiparkinson agents, whereas the 8,8 enantiomer demonstrates the a adrenergic receptor antagonism of antidepressant agents. The racemic compound is described by Faith et al. in U.S. Patent 3,642,789 where it is alleged to have antidepressant activity by virtue of its reserpine antagonism and amphetamine agonism. Surprisingly it is now found that the S,S enantiomer has only antidepressant activity.Even more surprisingly, it is found that the optical antipode, the R,R enantiomer has a somewhat opposite effect on the CNS being an antiparkinson agent. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide the pure R,R and 8,8 enantiomers of compound I, processes for preparing the pair of compounds, pharmaceutical formulations, and methods of treating depression with the S,S enantiomer or its pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of treating Parkinsonism with the R,R enantiomer or its pharmaceutical compositions.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The novel compounds of this invention are the R,R , and S,S enantiomer, each substantially free of the other, of the compound of structural formula EMI3.1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, whereinR is hydrogen branched or unbranched C1 4 alkyl, especially methyl, ethyl or propyl C25 alkenyl, especially allyl or phenyl C1 4 alkyl, especially beryl and R1 and R are independently hydrogen, hydroxy, or C14 alkoxy, especially methoxy, or ethoxy. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the novel compounds of this invention are acid addition salts formed from a novel compound and an organic or inorganic acid recognized by the art as providing a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, dihydrogen phosphate, sulfate, citrate, pamoate, pyruvate, napsylate, isethionate, maleate, fumarate, or the like. These salts are readily prepared by mixing solutions of equimolecular amounts of the free base compound and the desired acid in suitable solvents such as water, alcohols, ether or chloroform, followed by recoverv of the product by collecting the precipitated salt or evaporation of the solvent. The process for preparing the novel compounds is another embodiment of this invention and is represented as follows EMI4.1 R,R or S,S The novel process comprises the reduction of the oxazinone, II, with a metal hydride such as borane, in an inert organic solvent such as an ether, for example, tetrahydrofuran, 1, 2 dimethoxyethane, tetrahydropyran, or the like at a temperature between about OOC and 100 C. Operating procedures normally involve slow addition of the ketone to the reducing agent at room temperature or below, followed by heating to an elevated temperature within the stated range, preferably, the reflux temperature of the solvent, for about 1 2 to about 4 hours usually about 1 2 hours. A third embodiment of this invention is the pharmaceutical formulations comprising one of the novel compounds as active ingredient. They may be in any art recognized form suitable for oral use, such as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders, or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, syrups, or elixirs. For intravenous and intramuscular and subcutaneous use the pharmaceutical compositions may be in any art recognized form of a sterile injectable preparation such as a sterile aqueous or oleaqinous solution or suspension. The amount of active ingredient incorporated in a unit dosage of the above described pharmaceutical compositions may be from 1 to 400 mg, and preferably from 5 to 250 mg. Other embodiments of this invention are the treatment of depression with the S,S enantiomer andParkinsonism with the R,R enantiomer of the novel compounds. The route of administration can be oral, rectal, intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous.Doses of 1.0 to 200 mg kq day and preferably of 5.0 to 100 mg kg day of either active ingredient to demonstrate its respective utility are generally adequate, and if preferred it can be administered in divided doses given two to four times daily. It is to be noted that the precise unit dosage form and dosage level depend upon the requirements of the individual being treated, and consequently are left to the discretion of the therapist.
