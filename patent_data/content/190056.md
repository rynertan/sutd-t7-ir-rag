# SMALL INCISION INTRAOCULAR LENS

## Abstract
An intraocular lens comprising an elongate optic and first and second glare reducing sections extending along the long sides of the optic. The glare reducing sections are joined to each other and to the optic by a joining section. The joining section is flexible so that the glare reducing sections can be moved relative to the optic to reduce the overall dimensions of the intraocular lens for implantation. Fixation members fix the intraocular lens in the eye.
