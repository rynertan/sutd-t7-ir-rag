## Description
The present invention relates to an amphiphilic precursor of polyimide and a process for the preparation thereof, and more particularly to an amphiphilic polyimide precursor modified to form a film by the Langmuir Blodgett technique. In the 1930s, it was found by Langmuir and Blodgett that a fatty acid having 16 to 22 carbon atoms could form a monolayer monomolecular film on the surface of water and the monolayers could be built up on a substrate to form a multilayer film. In recent years, various studies have been made on the applications of the built up films, namely Langmuir Blodgett films hereinafter referred to as LB film . The LB films of the straight chain saturated fatty acids are poor in heat resistance and mechanical strength and are not suitable for practical uses. In order to improve the above problem, there are proposed, for instance, polymerizing films formed from unsaturated fatty acids such as ω tricosenoic acid, ω heptadecenoic acid and α octadecylacrylic acid, or unsaturated fatty acid esters such as vinyl stearate and octadecyl acrylate. However, these films are insufficient in heat resistance and other properties. On the other hand, it is well known that films of polyimide have excellent heat resistance. The thickness of the films prepared, for instance, by spin coating is at least 1,000 Å, usually 1 µm or more. It is very difficult to form a heat resistant polyimide film with a thickness of less than 1,000 Å and with no pin hole. It is an object of the present invention to provide an LB film having improved heat resistance, chemical resistance, mechanical properties such as adhesion and good insulation properties. A further object of the present invention is to provide a material capable of providing a heat resistant ultrathin film. A still further object of the present invention is to provide an ultrathin film of polyimides. These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent from the description hereafter. It has now been found that substituent groups for imparting the hydrophobic property to a polyamide acid can be introduced into the polyamide acid, and the monomolecular layer of the so modified polyamide acid having hydrophobic substituent groups is stable on water and can be transferred onto various substrates by the LB technique. It has also been found that ultrathin polyimide films can be produced from the multilayer films of the so modified polyamide acid. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an amphiphilic polyimide precursor having the recurring unit of the formula 1 wherein R¹ is a tetravalent group having at least 2 carbon atoms, R² is a divalent group having at least 2 carbon atoms, and R³, R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ are hydrogen atoms or monovalent groups having 1 to 30 carbon atoms selected from aliphatic groups, alicyclic groups, aromatic groups, groups in which an aliphatic group is combined with an aromatic group or an aliphatic group, and their groups substituted by a halogen atom, nitro group, amino group, cyano group, methoxy group or acetoxyl group, provided that at least one of R³, R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ is not a hydrogen atom or an above mentioned group which has 1 to 11 carbon atoms. The amphiphilic precursors of polyimides of the present invention are prepared, for instance, by a process in which a tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride of the formula 4 wherein R¹ is as defined above, is converted into an acid halide in a substantially anhydrous polar organic solvent at a temperature of not lower than 10 wherein R¹, R², R⁷ and R⁸ are as defined above. The amphiphilic polyimide precursors of the present invention are polymeric compounds having the recurring unit of the formula 1 wherein R¹ to R⁶ are as defined above, In the formula 1 , R¹ is a tetravalent group having at least two carbon atoms, preferably 5 to 20 carbon atoms. It may be an aromatic group an alicyclic group an aliphatic group a group wherein an aromatic group and an aliphatic group are combined a group wherein each of the above mentioned groups is substituted by a monovalent group having 1 to 30 carbon atoms selected from aliphatic groups, alicyclic groups, aromatic groups, and groups in which an aliphatic group is combined with an alicyclic group or an aromatic group or groups wherein each of the preceding groups is substituted by a monovalent group such as a halogen atom, nitro group, amino group, cyano group, methoxyl group or acetoxyl group, or by a group in which the above monovalent group bonds to O , COO , NHCO , CO , S , CSS , NHCS , CS ,. Groups characterized by benzenoid unsaturation having at least 6 carbon atoms are preferred as R¹ in points of heat resistance, chemical resistance and mechanical properties. Representative examples of the group R¹ are, for instance, or the like. The term benzenoid unsaturation as used herein is a technical term used in contradistinction to the quinoid structure, as shown below, and means structures same as those of carbon rings included in usual aromatic compounds. The positions of the four bonds of the group R¹, that is to say, the positions of the bonds linking R³OCO , COOR⁴, NR⁵CO and CO NR⁶ R² to R¹ in the recurring unit 1 , are not particularly limited. However, it is preferable that each two of these four bonds are present at adjacent two carbon atoms constituting the group R¹, since a five membered ring is easy to be formed when a film formed from the polyimide precursor is imidized. Preferable examples of the group R¹ as mentioned above are, for instance, The group of the formula is also preferable as the group R¹. The group R² in the formula 1 is a bivalent group having at least 2 carbon atoms. It may be an aromatic group an aliphatic group an alicyclic group a group wherein an aromatic group and an aliphatic group are combined a group wherein each of the above mentioned bivalent groups is substituted by a monovalent group having 1 to 30 carbon atoms selected from aliphatic groups, alicyclic groups, aromatic groups and groups in which an aliphatic group is combined with an alicyclic group or an aromatic group or groups wherein each of the preceding groups is substituted by a monovalent group such as a halogen atom, nitro group, amino group, cyano group, methoxyl group or acetoxyl group, or by a group in which the above monovalent group bonds to O , COO , NHCO , CO , S , CSS , NHCS , CS , or the like. Groups characterized by benzenoid unsaturation having at least 6 carbon atoms are preferred as the group R² in points of heat resistance, chemical resistance and mechanical properties. Representative examples of the group R² are, for instance, wherein R⁹ is O , CO , S , SO₂ , in which R¹⁰ and R¹¹ are an alkyl or aryl group having 1 to 30 carbon atoms , and Preferable groups R² are groups characterized by benzenoid unsaturation having at least 6 carbon atoms, for example, wherein R⁹ is as defined above. Each of the groups R³, R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ in the formula 1 is a hydrogen atom or a monovalent group having 1 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 22 carbon atoms, such as a monovalent aliphatic group, a monovalent alicyclic group, a monovalent aromatic group, a monovalent group wherein an aliphatic group is combined with an aromatic group or an alicyclic group, or their halogen, nitro, amino, cyano, methoxy or acetoxy substituted groups. The groups R³, R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ are groups introduced in order to impart hydrophobic properties to a polyamide acid having the recurring unit of the formula 9 wherein R¹ and R² are as defined above. Representative examples of the groups R³, R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ mentioned above are, for instance, wherein n is an integer of 12 to 30, preferably 16 to 22. For permitting the amphiphilic polyimide precursor of the invention to form a film by the LB technique, it is the most preferable that at least one, preferably at least two, of the groups R³, R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ are a straight chain alkyl group of the formula wherein n is as defined above, from the viewpoint of performances and cost. It is not essential that the substituent group, i.e. halogen atom, nitro group, amino group, cyano group, methoxyl group or acetoxyl group, as mentioned above is included in the groups R³, R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶. But it is preferable that fluorine atoms are included in the groups R³, R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶, because fluorine atoms vastly improve the hydrophobic property as compared with hydrogen atoms. In case that two of the group R³, R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ are hydrogen atoms, the amphiphilic polyimide precursors of the present invention include, for instance, precursors having the recurring unit of the formula 2 wherein R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ are as defined above, provided that R³ and R⁴ are not hydrogen atoms or groups having 1 to 11 carbon atoms, wherein R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ are as defined above, The amphiphilic polyimide precursors having the recurring unit of the formula 2 or 3 are advantageous in easiness of production and cost. Representative examples of the amphiphilic polyimide precursor having the recurring unit shown by the formula 1 , 2 or 3 are, for instance, those having the recurring unit of the formula in which typical examples of R³ and R⁴ are, for instance, CH₃ CH₂ ₁₁ , CH₃ CH₂ ₁₃ , CH₃ CH₂ ₁₅ , CH₃ CH₂ ₁₇ , CH₃ CH₂ ₁₉ , CH₃ CH₂ ₂₁ , and CF₃ CH₂ ₁₅ , in which typical examples of R⁵ and R⁶ are, for instance, CH₃ CH₂ ₁₁ , CH₃ CH₂ ₁₃ , CH₃ CH₂ ₁₅ , CH₃ CH₂ ₁₇ , CH₃ CH₂ ₁₉ , CH₃ CH₂ ₂₁ , and CF₃ CH₂ ₁₅ , in which typical examples of R³ and R⁴ are, for instance, CH₃ CH₂ ₁₁ , CH₃ CH₂ ₁₃ , CH₃ CH₂ ₁₅ , CH₃ CH₂ ₁₇ , CH₃ CH₂ ₁₉ , CH₃ CH₂ ₂₁ and CF₃ CH₂ ₁₅ , and typical examples of R⁵ and R⁶ are, for instance, CH₃ , CH₃ CH₂ ₂ , CH₃ CH₂ ₃ and CH₃ CH₂ ₅ , in which typical examples of R³ and R⁴ are, for instance, CH₃ CH₂ ₁₁ , CH₃ CH₂ ₁₃ , CH₃ CH₂ ₁₅ , CH₃ CH₂ ₁₇ , CH₃ CH₂ ₁₉ , CH₃ CH₂ ₂₁ and CF₃ CH₂ ₁₅ , or the like. In the above formulas, the symbol means isomerism. Explaining the isomerism with reference to the recurring unit of the formula the above formula represents both the recurring unit of the formula a and the recurring unit of the formula b and in such a case, the symbol indicating the isomerism is used. In the present specification, the term isomerism or the symbol comprehends the both cases, one being the case where either one of the recurring units as shown by the formulas a and b is present alone, and the other being the case where the recurring units as shown by the formulas a and b are present together. The amphiphilic polyimide precursor of the present invention having the recurring unit 1 may be a homopolymer comprising a single kind of recurring units or a copolymer comprising different kinds of recurring units. Various copolymers are provided when at least one of the groups R¹ to R⁶ in the formula 1 is at least two kinds of groups selected from the respective representative examples of the groups R¹ to R⁶ explained above. For instance, when are selected as the group R¹, the recurring unit of the polyimide precursor is represented by the following formula wherein x and y show a ratio, and 0 x 1, 0 y 1 and x y 1. When are selected as the group R², the recurring unit of the polyimide precursor is represented by the following formula wherein x and y are as defined above. In general, the amphiphilic polyimide precursors of the present invention are soluble in an organic polar solvent such as N,N dimethylacetamide, N,N dimethylformamide, N,N diethylformamide or hexamethylphosphoramide, and are soluble in a mixed solvent of the above mentioned organic polar solvent and a usual organic solvent such as chloroform, and are slightly soluble or insoluble in a usual organic solvent such as chloroform, benzene, ether, acetone or methanol. In the infrared absorption spectrum of the precursor, characteristic absorptions for amide, carboxylic acid in certain cases, carboxylic acid ester and long chain alkyl group are observed. The result of the thermal analysis of the precursors prepared particularly to have a good heat resistance is also characteristic, and a sudden loss of the weight begins at about 200 The aforementioned explanation has been made with reference to the case where all the recurring units of the precursor are those represented by the formula 1 . However, the precursors of the present invention may contain at most 30 by mole of the recurring unit of the formula 10 wherein R¹ and R² are as defined above, R is a monovalent group having 1 to 11 carbon atoms selected from the group consisting of a monovalent aliphatic group, a monovalent alicyclic group, a monovalent aromatic group, a monovalent group in which an aliphatic group is combined with an aromatic group or an alicyclic group, and thier substituted monovalent groups with a halogen atom, nitro group, amino group, cyano group, methoxyl group or acetoxyl group, or hydrogen atom, and four groups R may be the same or different. The amphiphilic polyimide precursors of the present invention having the recurring unit of the formula 1 can be prepared by the following method. A tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride of the formula 4 wherein R¹ is as defined above, wherein R¹, R³ and R⁴ are as defined above. The compound 5 is then converted into an acid halide, for instance, by reacting with thionyl chloride, phosphorus pentachloride, benzenesulfonyl chloride, or the like in a substantially anhydrous polar solvent at a temperature of not lower than 10 There is a case where the reaction must be conducted at a temperature other than the general temperature range as mentioned above. That is to say, when the groups R⁵ and R⁶ are not hydrogen atoms or groups having 1 to 11 carbon atoms, there is adopted a manner in which the acid halide of the compound 5 is added to a solution of the compound 6 at a temperature of 50 Representative examples of the tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride 4 are, for instance Representative examples of the compound R³OH and R⁴OH are, for instance, CH₃OH, CH₃CH₂OH, CH₃ CH₂ ₂OH, CH₃ CH₂ ₃OH, CH₃ CH₂ ₅OH, CH₃ CH₂ ₇OH, CH₃ CH₂ ₉OH, CH₃ CH₂ ₁₁OH, CH₃ CH₂ ₁₃OH, CH₃ CH₂ ₁₅OH, CH₃ CH₂ ₁₇OH, CH₃ CH₂ ₁₉OH, CH₃ CH₂ ₂₁OH, CH₃ CH₂ ₂₃OH, CF₃ CH₂ ₁₅OH, H CF₂ ₈ CH₂ ₁₅OH, H CF₂ ₄ CH₂ ₁₃OH, F CF₂ ₈ CH₂ ₂OH, F CF₂ ₈ CH₂ ₄OH, CH₃ ₃C CH₂ ₁₄OH, and the like. The reaction conditions for producing the compound 5 by the reaction of the tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride 4 with R³OH and R⁴OH are not particularly limited. For instance, the reaction can be conducted in a manner in which the reaction system is stirred at about 100 As the polar solvents used in the reaction for converting the compound 5 into the acid halide, there are mentioned, for instance, hexamethylphosphoramide, N,N dimethylacetamide and N,N dimethylformamide. The solvents are used in a substantially anhydrous state. That is to say, the reaction for the conversion into the acid halide is conducted under an approximately quantitative condition such that thionyl chloride, phosphorus pentachloride, benzenesulfonyl chloride, or the like used in the reaction would not decompose by moisture. When the reaction temperature for the conversion into the acid halide is lower than 10 The thus prepared acid halide is then reacted with the compound 6 to produce the precursor of the present invention. From the viewpoint of the workability, it is desirable to use the obtained acid halide as it is without any treatment. In the reaction of the acid halide and the compound 6 , both the reactants and the product tend to solidify by the long chain alkyl group of the groups R³, R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ present in these compounds and, therefore, it is general to use a solvent such as N,N dimethylacetamide or N,N dimethylformamide. The reaction temperature is not lower than 10 Representative examples of the compound 6 are, for instance, wherein R⁵ and R⁶ are as defined above. The ratio of the acid halide to the compound 6 is suitably selected so as to produce the precursor having a desired molecular weight. Conventionally, in case of preparing polyamide acids suitable for forming films, stoichiometric amounts of the purified monomers and a purified solvent have been used for obtaining the product having a high molecular weight. However, in the case where the precursor of the invention is used for forming films by building up monomolecular layer of the precursor on a substrate, a high molecular weight is not always required and even if the precursor has not a high molecular weight, sufficient characteristics can be exhibited. Accordingly, the molar ratio of the reactants may deviate from stoichiometric one, and the acid halide and the compound 6 can be used in a molar ratio of about 1 0.8 to about 1 1.2 without causing any problems. When both the groups R³ and R⁴ of R³OH and R⁴OH to be reacted with the tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride are not hydrogen atoms or groups having 1 to 11 carbon atoms, both of the groups R⁵ and R⁶ in the compound 6 may be hydrogen atoms, and in that case, the precursors having the recurring unit represented by the formula 2 are obtained. The use of the compound 6 in which both of the groups R⁵ and R⁶ are hydrogen atom, is advantageous in that the reactivity is good and the raw material cost is inexpensive. Also, in that case, since the COOR³ and COOR⁴ groups in the obtained precursor are in the state of ester, the precursor is thermally stable and the reaction scarcely proceeds in isolation and drying steps and, therefore, the precursor is separable in the form of solid powder and thus purification is easy. The amphiphilic polyimide precursors of the present invention can be prepared by the process mentioned above. When both of the groups R³ and R⁴ in the formula 1 are hydrogen atom, the precursors can also be prepared by directly reacting the tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride 4 with a compound of the formula 7 Representative examples of the compound 7 are, for instance, wherein R⁷ and R⁸ are as defined above. Approximately the same conditions as those in conventional preparation of polyamide acids are applicable to the reaction of the tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride 4 and the compound 7 . For instance, the reaction is conducted in a substantially anhydrous organic polar solvent such as N,N dimethylacetamide or N,N dimethylformamide at a temperature of not higher than 50 The thus prepared precursors 8 have also the features that they can form films by the LB method and provide polyimides by heating, in addition to easiness in preparation. LB films can be formed from the precursors of the present invention by any of the so called LB technique without restriction, e.g. the vertical dipping method LB method , the horizontal dipping method, the revolving cylindrical method and so on as discribed in Shin Jikken Kagaku Koza, Vol. 18, Interface and Colloid , pages 498 508 . The LB technique is a method in which a LB material is spread onto the surface of water and compressed at a constant surface pressure to form monomolecular layer film and the monomolecular layer is transferred onto a substrate. In general, a solvent such as benzene or chloroform which evaporates into a gas phase without dissolving in water, is used for spreading an LB film forming material onto the water surface. In case of the precursors of the present invention, it is preferable to use such a usual solvent in combination with an organic polar solvent for increasing the solubility. Examples of the organic polar solvent are, for instance, N,N dimethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide, N,N diethylformamide, N,N diethylacetamide, N,N dimethylmethoxyacetoamide, dimethylsulfoxide, N methyl 2 pyrrolidone, pyridine, dimethylsulfone, hexamethylphosphoramide, tetramethylenesulfone, and dimethyltetramethylenesulfone. In case of using benzene, chloroform or the like in combination with the organic polar solvent, it is considered that when the precursor solution is spread onto the water surface, benzene, chloroform or the like evaporates into the gas phase and the organic polar solvent dissolves into a large quantity of water. The concentration of the precursor solution to be spread onto the water surface is not particularly limited, but is usually selected from 2 X 10 ³ to 5 X 10 ³ M. The substrates used for forming LB films of the precursors thereon are not particularly limited, and are selected according to the uses of the formed LB film. In case of converting the LB film into a polyimide film by heating the LB film of the precursor, it is necessary that the substrates have a good heat resistance. Examples of the substrate used in forming the LB films are, for instance, an inorganic substrate such as glass, alumina or quartz, a metal substrate, a plastic substrate, a substrate of a semiconductor of Groups IV, III V, II VI of the Periodic Table such as Si, GaAs or ZnS, a substrate of a ferroelectric substance such as PbTiO₃, BaTiO₃, LiNbO₃ or LiTaO₃, or a substrate of a magnetic substance. The substrates may be surface treated in a usual manner. The precursors of the present invention can form thin films having no or a little defect and having a good heat resistance by the LB method, and can provide thin films having a further improved heat resistance by partially or completely converting the precursor thin film into a polyimide. Methods for converting the precursor into polyimide are not particularly limited, but heating at a temperature of about 200 Of course, the polyamide acid represented by the formula 9 can be converted into polyimide with formation of When the precursor converts into polyimide, the groups introduced for imparting the hydrophobic property to a polyamide acid eliminate in the form of an alcohol. Since the eliminated alcohol can be removed away or scattered away, for instance, by conducting the conversion into polyimide in a gas stream or under vacuum at a temperature of about 200 While the area time curve clearly reveals that the amphiphilic polyimide precursors of the present invention form ideal Y type films by the LB method vertical dipping method , the linearity of the relationship between the inverse capacitance 1 C and the number of layers in the built up film and data of X ray diffraction suggest that a layer structure expected to LB films is present in the built up films of the amphiphilic polyimide precursors of the present invention. Also, the thin films of the precursors of the invention have good heat resistance, dielectric characteristics and electric insulation properties as well as an excellent controllability of film thickness. Therefore, the LB films of the precursors can be directly used for the various purposes such as electronic devices. The polyimide thin films obtained from the precursors of the present invention have excellent heat resistance and chemical resistance and good mechanical properties. Because of the linearity of the relationship between 1 C and the number of layers, the built up film retains its excellent thickness controllability even after conversion into polyimide, thus it is possible to control the thickness of polyimide thin films on the basis of the number of layers in the built up films of the precursors. Furthermore, it is assumed that a layer structure is present in the polyimide thin films, and also it has been made clear that the polyimide thin films prepared according to the present invention have excellent dielectric characteristics and electric insulation properties. In particular, according to the present invention, it is possible to provide the polyimide thin films which have a high dielectric strength of not less than 1 X 10⁶ V cm even if the thickness is less than 1,000 Å. The films with a thickness of about 10,000 Å having good physical properties can be realized by the LB method, but when the preparation cost is taken into consideration, the thinner, the more inexpensive, and also from the viewpoint of utilization, thin films which cannot be prepared by other methods are of interest. That is to say, films having a thickness of not more than 2,000 Å, especially films having a thickness of not more than 1,000 Å or of several hundreds of angstroms or films having a thickness of 5 to 100 Å, have a possibility of new interesting applications. However, it has hitherto been difficult to realize a dielectric strength of not less than 1 X 10⁶ V cm with such a film thickness. According to the present invention, there can be provided polyimide thin films having a dielectric strength of not less than 1 X 10⁶ V cm which can be sufficiently utilized in the electronic field. In particular, in case of the films having a thickness of about 50 Å to several hundreds of angstroms, unique effects produced by film thickness, e.g. tunnel effect, are expected, and many attractive applications utilizing them become possible. Such a thin polyimide film can also be formed by spin coating or vapor deposition, but a highly skilled technique is required in achieving a dielectric strength of not less than 1 X 10⁶ V cm even with a thickness of more than 1 µm. Accordingly, it is to be understood that by the existing techniques, it is difficult to form polyimide thin films with a thickness of not more than 1,000 Å having a dielectric strength of not less than 1 X 10⁶ V cm as obtained by the present invention. Further, thin films obtained by partial conversion into polyimide under mild conditions rather than complete conversion also have a good heat resistance of more than 200 By utilizing the above mentioned excellent properties, e.g. heat resistance, chemical resistance, mechanical characteristics and electric insulation properties, and the film thickness of not more than 10,000 Å, e.g. 5 to 1,000 Å, the thin films of the present invention can be used in various fields of art such as electronics, energy conversion and material separation. For instance, by utilizing electric conductivity, photo conductivity, optical property, insulating property, thermal property and chemical reactivity, the thin films obtained according to the present invention are usable as optical recording film, resist film, insulation film, thin film for capacitors, liquid crystal orientation film, polarization film, and sensor film. In particular, in case of the insulation film, the thin films of the invention are useful as insulation films for IC and LSI and can be used as insulation films in electric and eletronic devices having MIS or MIM structure wherein various semiconductors and metals are combined with insulation films, e.g. field effect transistor, photoelectric device, light emitting device, light receiving device, light detecting device, and therminonic transistor. In particular, the thin films of the present invention are useful for use in MIS and MIM devices utilizing the tunnel effect and are usable as insulation films for JJ Josephson junction . In addition, it is also possible to utilize the precursors of the invention as cladding material for waveguide and a component for optical circuit. Further, the precursors of the invention are suitable as protective coating materials in various fields. By utilizing the techniques for mixed films or assembled films of functional LB materials and fatty acids generally used in the field of LB films so as to use the precursors of the present invention instead of the fatty acids, various functionalities can be revealed and the uses utilizing them are considered. For instance, photoelectric devices and biosensors can be fabricated by forming films containing pigments or enzymes. The present invention is more specifically described and explained by means of the following Examples. A flask was charged with 2.18 g 0.01 mole of pyromellitic dianhydride and 5.40 g 0.02 mole of stearyl alcohol, and they were reacted at about 100 The resulting reaction product was dissolved in 40 ml of hexamethylphosphoramide and cooled to 0 To the reaction mixture was then added dropwise 2 g 0.01 mole of diaminodiphenyl ether dissolved in 50 ml of dimethylacetamide at a temperature of 0 IR absorption analysis, thermal analysis TGA and DTA , and measurement of molecular weight by gel permeation chromatography GPC were made, and it was confirmed that the product was the objective polyimide precursor. IR spectrum of the product measured by KBr disk method is shown in Fig. 1. Characteristic absorptions of ester, amido I, II and III absorption bands, alkyl chain and ether are observed in the spectrum. The results of thermal analysis measured by a RTG DTA H type analyzer made by Rigaku Denki Kabushiki Kaisha with full scale 10 mg for TGA thermogravimetric analysis and 100 µV for DTA differential thermal analysis by elevating the temperature at a rate of 10 In the TGA curve, inflection points are observed at 193 The thermal analysis of the product was also conducted by raising the temperature to 400 It is observed in Fig. 3 that by keeping the temperature at 400 The number average molecular weight of the product measured by using N,N dimethylacetamide as a solvent was about 50,000 calculated in terms of polystyrene . A solution of a polyimide precursor to be spread onto the surface of water for forming a monomolecular film was prepared by dissolving 55.1 mg of the product obtained in Example 1 in a mixed solvent of distilled chloroform and dimethylacetamide in a ratio of 8 2 by volume so that the total volume was 25 ml. The obtained solution was spread onto the surface of bidistilled water, and the relationship between the surface pressure π and the area per recurring unit unit was measured at 20 A built up film of 60 layers was formed on a glass substrate or a CaF₂ plate substrate according to the LB method by raising and lowering the substrate through the water surface at a speed of 10 mm minute, while maintaining the surface pressure of the monolayer on the water surface at 25 dyne cm at 20 The film formed on the CaF₂ plate was analyzed by FT IR analysis. The obtained IR absorption spectrum is shown in Fig. 5. From the IR spectrum, it was confirmed that the built up film was a film of the compound obtained in Example 1. Also, from the area time curve, it was confirmed that the built up film was a Y type film. Further, in the X ray diffraction of the built up film, one peak was observed at 2ϑ 4.65 The built up film was heated at 400 With respect to the product of Example 1, it is also confirmed by IR absorption analysis, etc. that weight loss of 58 occurs by heating at 400 A polyimide precursor was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except that n decyl alcohol n C₁₀H₂₁OH was used instead of stearyl alcohol. The results of IR analysis, thermal analysis and measurement of molecular weight by GPC of the obtained precursor showed approximately the same characteristics as those of the polyimide precursor obtained in Example 1, but the surface pressure area curve thereof was different. The surface pressure area curve is shown in Fig. 6. The obtained precursor showed only a liquid expansion phase, and did not show the presence of a condensed monomolecular layer. From this result, it is understood that the introduction of an alkyl group having 10 carbon atom into a polyamide acid is too short in chain length to obtain a stable monomolecular layer. For instance, the film maintained at 20 dyne cm in surface pressure on the water surface was unstable, thus the precursor obtained in this example did not give a good built up film. Polyimide precursors were prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except that lauryl alcohol C₁₂ , myristyl alcohol C₁₄ or cetyl alcohol C₁₆ was used instead of stearyl alcohol. The obtained precursor by using the C₁₂ or C₁₄ alcohol showed behaviors intermediate between those for C₁₀ and C₁₈, and formed a sufficiently stable monolayer and could form a built up film. The precursor obtained by using the C₁₆ alcohol formed a very stable monolayer on the water surface and could form a good built up film. Also, it was confirmed that the precursors obtained in these Examples were converted into polyimides by heat treatment. The reaction of 10.91 g of pyromellitic dianhydride and 27.05 g of stearyl alcohol was carried out at 120 In 60 ml of hexamethylphosphoramide was dissolved 3.79 g of distearyl pyromellitate, and 1.19 g of thionyl chloride was added dropwise to the resulting solution at about 5 The results of IR analysis and ¹H NMR analysis of the obtained powder are as follows The IR spectrum measured by KBr method is shown in Fig. 7. Characteristic absorptions of ester, amido I, II and III absorption bands and alkyl chain are observed in the spectrum. The analysis was conducted by using a mixed solvent of CDCℓ₃ and DMF d₇. Peaks were observed at δ values, 0.7 1.7 7OH, CO₂CH₂ The LB film forming properties of the product obtained in Example 6 were evaluated in the same manner as in Example 2. The surface pressure area curve measured on bidistilled water at 20 A built up film of 31 layers was formed on an aluminum deposited glass substrate by vertical dipping method at a dipping speed of 10 mm minute, while maintaining the surface pressure of the monolayer on the water surface at 25 dyne cm at 20 In a nitrogen stream, 15.6 g of p phenylenediamine, 15.5 g of stearyl bromide and 1.96 g of powdery caustic soda were reacted with stirring at a temperature of 140 By the ¹H NMR analysis, IR analysis and elemental analysis of the obtained powder, it was confirmed that the product was N,N distearyl p phenylenediamine. The analysis was conducted using CDCℓ₃ as a solvent. Peaks were observed at δ values, 0.5 2.5 74H, The IR spectrum measured by KBr disk method is shown in Fig. 9. In 50 ml of hexamethylphosphoramide was dissolved 2.28 g of distearyl pyromellitate. To the resulting solution was added dropwise 0.714 g of thionyl chloride at room temperature, and the mixture was further stirred for 1 hour. The obtained reaction mixture was added dropwise with stirring at a temperature of about 50 The obtained powder was subjected to IR analysis, ¹H NMR analysis, thermal analysis and measurement of molecular weight by GPC in the same manner as in Example 1, and it was confirmed that the product was the objective precursor. The IR spectrum is shown in Fig. 10.
