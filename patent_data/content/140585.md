# A method of forming a solderable, electrically conductive film on a substrate and the conductive composition itself.

## Abstract
A solderable electrically conductive composition com prising metallic silver particles embedded in a matrix of carboxylated vinyl and epoxy may be made by forming an ink comprising a mixture of a solution of vinyl in a solvent, metallic silver particles and the epoxy. The ink is applied to a substrate to form a film which is heated to evaporate the solvent and preferably to allow polymerization to occur thereby leaving the solderable electrically conductive film on the substrate.
