# ORANGE FLAVOR AND AROMA COMPOSITIONS MADE BY DENSE GAS EORANGE FLAVOR AND AROMA COMPOSITIONS MADE BY DENSE GAS EXTRACTION OF ORGANIC ORANGE FLAVOR AND AROMA COMPOUNDS XTRACTION OF ORGANIC ORANGE FLAVOR AND AROMA COMPOUNDS

## Abstract
The present invention is concentrated orange flavor and aroma compositions prepared by the extraction of organic orange flavor and aroma compounds by a dense solvent gas. The compositions are characterized by high concentrations of ethyl butyrate at least about 0.50 and valencene at least about 5 , and a low concentration of decanal less than about 0.35 . They are prepared by a process comprising the steps of a contacting organic orange flavor and aroma compounds with a solvent gas having a temperature between its critical temperature and about 100 C 212 F , and having a reduced pressure between about 0.56 and about 1.31, to extract flavor and aroma compounds the majority of which have a molecular weight less than or equal to that of limonene b separating the solvent gas and dissolved compounds from the remaining undissolved compounds and c separating the dissolved compounds from the solvent gas. The composition can be added to orange juice and orange beverages to anhance fresh orange flavor.
