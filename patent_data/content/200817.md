# Lightly crosslinked linear olefinic polymer foam blends and process for making foams.

## Abstract
An expandable blend of a linear olefinic polymer and a cross linkable polymer for production of lightly cross linked foamed polymers and a process for the preparation thereof is provided. The presence of a cross linkable poly mer component in the blend increases the melt strength of the linear olefinic component so that conventional melt processing techniques may be utilized to produce foamed polymers. Both open and closed cell foams may be produced.
