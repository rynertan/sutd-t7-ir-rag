# Method for modifying the surface of polymer materials.

## Abstract
A block copolymer consisting of a hydrophilic polymer por tion and a polymer portion having a compatibility with a poly mer material can be easily synthesized in the presence of a polymeric peroxide or a polyazo compound, and can modify easily and permanently the surface of the polymer material.
