# ELECTRICAL CONNECTORS CAPABLE OF WITHSTANDING GREAT CHANGES IN AMBIENT PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE

## Abstract
A separable electric connector for use downhole in the oil industry or else where when large pressure changes are encountered comprises a socket part 1 which, prior to the assembly of the part, can be filled with a viscous insulating fluid. The corresponding plug part 2 has a tubular member 7 which is closed at one end and surrounds the socket part with a clearance when the connector is assembled. A male member 11 which forms or carries contacts is upstanding from the closed end of the tubular member to enter the socket part and make the required contact or contacts. A passage 12, 13 is provided to allow flow of the fluid from the socket member 1 into the space 14 within the tubular member. A sleeve member 3 subsequently enters the tubular member 2, whereupon the fluid flows mainly between the sleeve member and the tubular member until a seal is formed, for instance by the ring 22. An escape path is formed, as between the socket member 1 and the sleeve member 3, to allow the subsequent escape of excess fluid. In this way air is reliably purged from the spaces between the parts of the connector.
