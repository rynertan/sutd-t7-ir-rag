# Process for fabricating three dimensional semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A process of fabrictating a three dimensional semicon ductor device, comprising the steps of preparing at least two multilayer structures 24,24 each including at least one semiconductor element 38 and a conductor 48, 48 con nected at one end to the semiconductor element and having at the other end an exposed surface, at least one of the mul tilayer structures further including a thermally fusible insu lating adhesive layer having a surface coplanar with the ex posed surface of the conductor, positioning the multilayer structures so that the exposed surfaces of the respective conductors of the multilayer structures are spaced apart from and aligned with each other, moving at least one of the multilayer structures with respect to the other until the ex posed surfaces of the conductors of the multilayer struc tures contact each other, and heating the multilayer struc tures for causing the insulating adhesive layer of at least one of the multilayer structures to thermally fuse to the oth er multilayer structure with the semiconductor elements electrically connected together.
