# METHOD OF TREATING A BLANKET OF CERAMIC FIBRES

## Abstract
A method of treating a blanket of ceramic fibers con taining 40 to 65 by weight of alumina and 35 to 60 by weight of silica, which occupy a total of at least 95 by weight, while the balance is other metal oxides, heat treated at a temperature of 950 C to 1100 C, whereby fine crystals are formed in the fibers, and having a thickness of 6 to 50 mm. The blanket is compressed between a pair of press es having therebetween a clearance which is equal to 40 to 80 of the blanket thickness, while it is passed through the roll clearance at a speed of not more than 500 cm per minute.
