# Electrolytic cell with ion exchange membrane.

## Abstract
In an electrolytic cell divided into anode and cathode compartments by an ion exchange membrane, the space in the compartments between the electrode 4 and cell wall 2 incorporates an open ended duct 11. The duct has a horizontal part 14 with a lower opening 16 adjacent a fresh electrolyte inlet 7, and a vertical part or parts 13 with an upper opening 1 adjacent a spent electrolyte outlet 8. Gas bubbles in the electrolyte from gas evolved at the electrode 4 cause a difference in gross density between electrolyte outside the duct 11 and within the duct 11, resulting in a down flow of electrolyte through the duct.
