# Multi component cutting element using consolidated rod like polycrystalline diamond.

## Abstract
An enlarged diamond table for use as a cutter 10 in rotating drill bits is provided by disposing a plurality of ther mally stable or leached polycrystalline diamond PCD rod like elements 12 within a matrix body 16 . In one embodi ment the matrix body 16 is impregnated with diamond grit and completely fills the interstitial spaces between the plural ity of diamond elements 12 . Generally, the diamond ele ments 12 have their longitudinal axes arranged in a mutually parallel configuration. The bundle of rod like diamond ele ments 12 are in one embodiment in a compact touching array and in another embodiment in a spaced apart array. In the illustrated embodiment, a bundle of rod like diamond elements are disposed so that their end surfaces are exposed on the cutting face 14 of the cutting slug 10 . The slug 10 is then in turn mounted on a stud or directly infiltrated into a matrix body bit.
