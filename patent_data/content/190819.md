## Description
This invention relates to suspension fertilisers and to a process for their preparation. Suspension fertilisers are suspensions of small crystals in a mother liquor which a comprises fertiliser material and b is saturated with respect to the fertiliser material of which the small crystals are comprised they contain at least one of N, P and K and often trace elements in prearranged ratios for various agricultural applications. Sources of nitrogen in such suspension fertilisers include The crystals readily deposit from the suspension unless it is continuously agitated and there is also a tendency for crystal growth to continue within a suspension fertiliser after it has been formulated. The storage instability of such suspension fertilisers leads to a the formation of heavy deposits in storage tanks, which deposits are difficult to redisperse, and b blockage of pipes, nozzles and jets in spraying equipment. To improve the storage stability of suspension fertilisers a non swelling clay, e.g. attapulgite, is commonly added. Recently, to improve further the storage stability of such suspension fertilisers the addition of various further additives, for example carboxymethylcellulose, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, ferro cyanides and water soluble dyestuffs which may act as suspension aids and or crystal modifiers has been proposed. We have now found that by careful choice of additives and of the method and order of addition used in the preparation of suspension fertilisers, suspension fertilisers of improved storage stability may be prepared. We have also found that where suspension fertilisers contain suspended potassium chloride crystals together with dissolved nitrate ions, additives which prevent both the growth of potassium chloride crystals and potassium nitrate crystals must be added in order to obtain suspension fertilisers of good storage properties. Furthermore, we have found that swellable clays, e.g. bentonite, may be used as suspending aids provided that they are pre swollen in an aqueous medium which is preferably water. Accordingly the present invention provides a process of preparing a suspension fertiliser, the constituents of said suspension fertiliser comprising a suspending agent, particles of potassium chloride, a crystal growth inhibitor, and an aqueous solution containing a nutrient material, and wherein said nutrient material contains a source of at least one of nitrogen and phosphorus, characterised in that the constituents are sequentially mixed in the order The nutrient material used in step i of the above process comprises phosphorus and or nitrogen. Examples of nitrogen containing nutrient material include ammonia anhydrous or aqueous , metal nitrate, metal nitrite, ammonium nitrate and urea. Examples of phosphorus containing nutrient material include phosphoric acid, triple superphosphate, metal phosphate and metal hydrogen phosphates. Further examples of nutrient material are ammonium phosphate and metal ammonium phosphates. Mixtures of all of the above are within the present invention. Optionally further nutrient materials may be present, such as sulphur and magnesium compounds. The term ammonium phosphate includes mixtures of diammonium hydrogen phosphate and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate in, for example, a molar ratio of about 2 1, and also includes ammonium polyphosphate. Conveniently the ammonium phosphate is derived from wet process phosphoric acid or merchant grade phosphoric acid by methods known in the art. The nutrient material used in step i is conveniently in the form of an aqueous solution. However, in the production of fertilisers from wet process phosphoric acid, a by product is produced which contains salts formed from impurities present in the wet process acid. These salts are mainly salts of iron, aluminium and magnesium and are obtained as a slurry of particles suspended in an ammonium phosphate liquor. Such a slurry can be used in the process of the present invention, thus providing an additional source of nutrients. The concentration of ammonium phosphate, where present, in an aqueous solution when used in step i , is suitably between 0.1 The concentrations of ammonium nitrate and urea, where present, in an aqueous solution when used in step i , are suitably between 0.1 47 preferably 0.1 20 Suitable crystal growth inhibitors used in step i of the process of the present invention include ferrocyanide salts, ferricyanide salts, polyphosphates, hexametaphosphates wherein the phosphorus atoms can be present in linear, branched chain or ring form , metavanadates, sulphonated mono , bi and poly nuclear aromatic compounds, sulphonated dyes, sulphonated polymers, aminated polymers, polyacrylic acids, borax, cadmium chloride, lead chloride, sorbitol, polyvinyl alcohol, caseinate and soluble starch hydrolysate. More suitably the crystal growth inhibitors are potassium or sodium ferrocyanide, a polyphosphate, a salt of β naphthol sulphonic acid condensed with formaldehyde such as the sodium, potassium or ammonium salt, or sodium or potassium hexametaphosphate. Suitable polyphosphates include sodium polyphosphate, tetrasodium diphosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate and various polyphosphates in the form of glasses. Preferably the polyphosphates marketed under the Trade Mark CALGON Albright and Wilson are used as crystal growth inhibitors. Ferrocyanide salts, for example sodium ferrocyanide and potassium ferrocyanide are preferred crystal growth inhibitors. It will be appreciated that where suspension fertilisers contain potassium ions and nitrate ions there will be a tendency for potassium nitrate crystals to grow, even where potassium nitrate per se has not been used in the preparation of the suspension fertiliser. Where nitrates are present in the suspension fertiliser and the temperature under which the suspension fertiliser is stored is not kept substantially constant, then a suitable crystal growth inhibitor, other than ferrocyanide, is necessary. It will be appreciated that temperature increase may cause suspended solids to dissolve and subsequent temperature decrease may cause crystallisation on cooling. In a preferred aspect we have found the presence of a polyphosphate to be advantageous for maintaining desirable suspension characteristics of fertiliser containing nitrate when subjected to temperature fluctuations over a period of time. The concentrations of ferrocyanide and polyphosphate, where used, in the mixture produced in step i of the process are suitably between 0.05 and 0.5 Optionally a polymeric additive is incorporated in step i of the process to facilitate redispersion should any syneresis occur. By the term polymeric additive is meant an organic polymer which is soluble in the aqueous solution or slurry used in step i and which does not react adversely with any of the components of the suspension fertiliser. Examples of such additives are polyethylene glycol, for example of molecular weight of about 6000, and carboxymethylcellulose salts for example the sodium salt. The concentration of the polymeric additive, where present, in the mixture prepared in step i of the process is typically between 0.05 and 0.5 Generally potassium chloride is used in step ii of the process of the present invention in the form of crystals. Mixing, in step ii of the process of the present invention, is suitably performed by milling. Conveniently this operation is carried out in a mill capable of reducing the particle size of the potassium chloride to the range of 50 to 500 µm. This is preferably carried out in a colloid mill. Typically the mixture is passed through the mill two or three times. The particle size distribution preferably has the maximum at less than 500 µm. The concentration of potassium chloride in the mixture produced in step ii of the process of the present invention is typically between 0.1 and 50 Suitably the suspending agent for use in step iii is silica or preferably a clay. Examples of suitable clays include acicular habit attapulgite or preferably a swellable clay, e.g. a magnesium alumino silicate, which may be synthetic, or preferably, for reasons of cost, naturally occurring, more preferably bentonite montmorillonite in its sodium form. Where bentonite montmorillonite is used it is added in the form of a pre swollen suspension in an aqueous medium, preferably water. Typically a mixture of bentonite montmorillonite and water is mixed in a high shear mixer and then allowed to stand, typically for about 24 hours. The pre swollen suspension typically comprises about 1 part by weight of bentonite montmorillonite to about 5 parts by weight of water. Mixing, in step iii of the process according to the present invention, is preferably carried out in a colloid mill. Typically one pass through the mill is sufficient to form a storage stable suspension fertiliser. The suitable clay generally provides less than 10 , for example 1 10 and usually less than 5 The invention is further illustrated with reference to the following examples. Crystal growth inhibitors were dissolved in an aqueous solution of nutrient material Solution A was obtained. Potassium chloride, sufficient to provide 45 A suspension 15 A portion of Suspension C was added to a portion of Mixture B and the resulting mixture was passed through a colloid mill three times to form a suspension fertiliser which was stored for 6 months at ambient temperature. In a first comparative test CT1 potassium chloride crystals and a portion of Suspension C were mixed and then added to Solution A. The results in Table 1 show the importance of the process of this invention. In second and third comparative tests CT2 and CT3 crystal growth inhibitors employed did not include sodium polyphosphate. In a fourth comparative test, commercial grade bentonite as obtained was added to a portion of Mixture B the bentonite remaining in clumps and a suspension fertiliser could not be formed, showing the advantage of pre swollen bentonite. This Example illustrates the effect of altering the concentration of clay on the sedimentation properties of suspension fertilisers prepared by the process according to the present invention. The general procedure of Examples 1 12, was repeated using the concentrations of Example 4 except that the concentration of bentonite was varied and the fertiliser compositions were stored for 25 days. The results are shown in Table 2. In Example 13, at bentonite concentrations from 1.0 to 3.0 , the sediment could be readily redispersed to reform a suspension fertiliser in comparative tests at a bentonite concentration of 0.75 , potassium chloride had been deposited as a layer below the bentonite and could not be redispersed. This example illustrates the stability to temperature cycling of suspension fertilisers which are prepared by the process of the present invention and contain a ferrocyanide and a polyphosphate. A suspension fertiliser was prepared by the process of the present invention having the composition indicated in Example 2. A first portion thereof was maintained at room temperature for 10 days and a second portion thereof was cycled between 5 In comparative tests CT4 and Example 17 the polyphosphate was omitted from the preparation of the suspension fertiliser. This shows that at constant temperature the presence of polyphosphate is not necessary to achieve desirable characteristics. The results are shown in Table 3. These Examples illustrate the use of attapulgite as the clay in the process according to the present invention. Examples 1 8 were repeated except that attapulgite was used instead of bentonite and at twice the concentration at which bentonite had been used.
