# COPOLYESTER CARBONATE RESINS

## Abstract
Thermoplastic aromatic copolyester carbonate resins exhibiting improved processability derived from i at least one diester diol which is the coreaction product of a at least one aromatic hydroxy carboxylic acid or an ester forming reactive derivative thereof, and b at least one diol selected from aliphatic diols, aliphatic ether diols, and aromatic diols ii at least one dihydric phenol and iii a carbonyl halide carbonate precursor.
