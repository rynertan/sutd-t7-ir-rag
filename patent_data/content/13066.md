# Polymers with improved solvent holdout in electroconductive paper and electroconductive recording paper and electroconductive coating colour formulations containing them.

## Abstract
Copolymers useful in making electroconductive paper which impart improved solvent holdout properties to the electro conductive paper comprise monomer units of quater nary diallyl dialkylammonium and a monomer of the for mula CH₂ C R₁ C O O R₂, where R₁ is hydrogen or methyl R₂ is an alkyl group of 2 to 12 carbon atoms, that number being designated n, substituted with fluorine atoms in number equal to from n to 2n and for the quaternary diallyldialkylammonium monomer, the alkyl groups are simi lar or dissimilar alkyl groups of one of 18 carbon atoms. Certain cyano and carboxylic acyl or acylamino monomers may be a further ingredient in making the copolymers. Electroconductive papers and electroconductive coating color formulations contain the said copolymers.
