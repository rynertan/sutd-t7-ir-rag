# Hydraulic assistance device.

## Abstract
Hydraulic assistance device of the mixed hydrodynamic hydrostatic type incorporating a body 10 in which a first piston 18 is slideably mounted and moveable between a first position allowing the communication of a first chamber 53 , joined to a braking circuit, to a reservoir 12 , and iso lating this chamber 53 from a source of high pressure fluid 86 , and a second position isolating the chamber 53 from the reservoir 12 and connecting it with the source 86 a second chamber 30 in the body 10 connected by a passage 90 to the brakes 66 , and valve means 92 normally closing the passage 90 and sensitive to the pressure in the chamber 30 so that, when the latter pressure reaches a value which is greater than that existing in the first chamber 53 , the valve means 92 opens allowing fluid to flow between the second chamber 30 and the brakes 66 .
