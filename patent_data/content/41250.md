# Solar collector.

## Abstract
A solar energy collector formed of an inclined corrugated radiant heat absorbing panel 14 for absorbing direct and reflected solar radiation having a plurality of air passageways formed by the convolutions of the corrugations, an air intake manifold 20 and an air exhaust manifold 22 connected to the passageways in said panel, an inflatable air tight bag 25 surrounding the collector assembly and a source of pressur ized air connected to said air inlet manifold 20 for pressuriz ing the system and for forcing air through the heat absorbing panel for heating the same.
