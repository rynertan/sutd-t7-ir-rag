# End effector apparatus for positioning a steam generator heat exchanger tube plugging tool.

## Abstract
Robotic apparatus for moving and positioning a tool for plugging a defective tube of a heat exchanger of a steam gen erator in a nuclear reactor includes a base, a plug magazine supported on the base, a guidance mechanism mounting the plugging tool and a positioning mechanism supported on the base and mounting the guidance mechanism. The guidance mechanism is operable to align the tool relative to the plug magazine and the defective heat exchanger tube to do plug loading. The positioning mechanism is operable to assume folded and unfolded conditions to transfer the guidance mechanism and the plugging tool therewith respectively be tween the plug dispensing and applying positions.
