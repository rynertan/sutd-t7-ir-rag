## Abstract
A spontaneous opal glass characterised in that it demon strates a dense white appearance, a softening point of at least 710 C and excellent chemical durability, contains Ba₂F PO₄ as the predominant crystalline opal phase and comprises, ex pressed in terms of weight percent on the oxide basis, from 6 to 10 Na₂O, from 1 to 6 K₂O, from 4 to 11 BaO, from 9 to 18 Al₂O₃, from 1 to 5 B₂O₃, from 50 to 70 SiO₂, from 3.5 to 7 P₂O₅ and from 1 to 4 F is disclosed. The present glasses constitute an improvement over known glasses.
