# Process for preparing sugar acetates.

## Abstract
A cost effective process suitable for the commercial production of the sugar acetate, glucose penta acetate and xylose tetra acetate is disclosed. The process comprises a first reaction stage wherein glucose or xylose is partially acetylated with acetic acid to form glucose diacetate or xylose diacetate, followed by a second reaction stage wherein said diacetate product is fully acetylated by treat ment with excess acetic anhydride to form glucose penta acetate or xylose tetra acetate, respectively. Any excess of acetic anhydride acetic acid and by product acetic acid can be recycled for use in the process.
