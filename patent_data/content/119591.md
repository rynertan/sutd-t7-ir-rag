## Description
THIODEAZAPURINE DERIVATIVES This invention relates to novel 7 deazapurine derivatives and a process for production thereof. Natural 6 oxo modified bases for example, Q base,Pre Q1 base having the same nucleus as that of compounds of this invention are widely distributed in life as constituents of certain tRNA tRNA Y , tRNA , tRNAASP and tRNAASn . These bases are situated at the first position of the anticodons of the aforementioned tRNAs and play an important biological role by recognizing the genetic information from mRNA directly and being involved in protein synthesis. With the recent advance of fundamental biochemical research, in particular, the structures of tRNAs and the role they play in vital phenomena have been elucidated one after another and the differences in tRNA between a cancer cell and a normal cell have also been clarified.One of the differences is that in a cancer cell the uptake of Q bases into tRNA precursors is incomplete and there invariably exist Q deficient tRNAs. It has also been observed that when a Q base is supplied from an external source, such a Q deficient tRNA takes the Q base into the predetermined position the first letter of the anticodon and thereby returns to the normal tRNA and that generally the uptake of Q bases is not observed in normal cells but is specific to cancer cells Nishimura S., Taisha Metabolism Vol. 17, Special Issue Gann Cancer 80 , pp.127 136 l980 . Under the circumstances the present inventors studied various derivatives of such 6 oxo modified bases and found that the compounds obtainable on transformation of the 6position of such bases to a thio group are novel compounds having excellent antitumor and antibiotic activities.These studies were followed by further studies which led to completion of this invention.

The molecular weight of amine III is preferably not more than about 500. The substitution reaction in accordance with the invention can be effected, for example, by bringing the compound tII or a salt thereof into contact with the compound III or a salt thereof in a III II molar ratio of about 1 to 20 in the absence or presence of an adequate solvent at a temperature of about OOC to the boiling point of the solvent employed, preferably at a temperature within the range of about 20 to 1000C, for about one hour to about 5 days. In case the compound II is used in the form of a quaternary salt, such as a quaternary salt with methyl bromide, methyl iodide, methyl methanesulfonate, methyl benzenesulfonate or methyl ptoluenesulfonate, the reaction can be effected under milder conditions.The quaternary salt of compound II prepared in the above case may be subjected to substitution reaction with the compound III , either after isolation or directly without isolation. Where R1 is an acyl group, deacylation elimination of R1 may, as necessary, be effected simultaneously by continuing heating of the reaction mixture at about 70 to 1000C. The deacylation may also be conducted by any known method of hydrolysis e.g.acid hydrolysis, alkali hydrolysis, ammonolysis . The solvent for the substitution reaction between compound II and compound III is exemplified as water, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanoir pentanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetonitrile, pyridine, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, sulfolane, and adequate mixtures of these.In cases where the compound II or compound III is used in the form of a salt, the desired product I can advantageously be produced by adjusting the reactant mixture to an optimal pH generally about 5 to 13 with a base e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, triethylamine, N methylmorpholine or a salt e.g. sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate . In cases where the hydrocarbon residues R4 and R5 are substituted, for example, by a carboxy, hydroxy, amino or alkylamino group, a starting compound III having such a substituent already protected or protected beforehand e.g. alkanoyloxy, alkoxycarbonyl, alkanoylamido by any per se known method J.F.W. McOmie, Protective Groups inOrganic Chemistry, Plenum Press, London and New York 1973 1 may, as necessary, be subjected to substitution reaction with another starting compound II , followed by elimination of the protective group from the resulting compound I . The elimination of such protective group is effected by subjecting the protective group bearing compound to an adequate, generally known protective group elimination reaction. Thus, for instance, an acid e.g. hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, boron trifluoride, boron tribromide, hydrogen bromide acetic acid , or a base te g. lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, aqueous ammonia, methylamine, dimethylamine, ethylamine, diethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine is added and the mixture is maintained, in an appropriate solvent e.g. water, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, methyl ether, ethyl ether, dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, toluene, xylene, or an adequate mixture of these , at a temperature of about 150 to 100 C, preferably 100 to 500C, for about 30 minutes to about 100 hours, preferably for about 1 to 20 hours. Alternatively, a catalyst suited for use in catalytic reduction e.g.palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, nickel is added and catalytic reduction is carried out in an appropriate solvent e.g. water, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, methyl ether, ethyl ether, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, acetic acid, or an adequate mixture of these at a temperature of about 10 to 500C for about 1 to 100 hours. The 7 deazapurine derivative I produced by the method of the invention can be isolated from the reaction mixture by generally known separation and or purification methods, such as concentration, solvent extraction, chromatography, and recrystallization. The compound I , when obtained in the free form, may be converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt by the conventional method. As the salt of the compound I , there are exemplified by mineral acid salts with hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, boric acid, etc., organic acid salts with oxalic acid, tartaric acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzensulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, etc., and quaternary salts with methyl bromide, methyl iodide, methyl methanesulfonate, methyl benzenesulfonate, methyl p toluensulfonate, etc. The compound I , when obtained in a salt form other than the quaternary salt form, may, as desired, be converted to the free form. In this instance, the conversion to the free form can easily be effected by subjecting the salt of compound I to an adequate, generally known treatment, such as neutralization or anion exchange chromatography. The thus obtained compounds I and salts thereof inhibit the growth of cultured L5178Y cells in vitro and of Meth A, Sarcoma 180 and so forth in vivo and thus have antitumor activity. The compounds I or salts thereof, when intraperitoneally administered to mice in a dose of 200 mg kg, do not cause any death. Therefore, the compounds I and salts thereof can be used as antitumor agents for the tumor treatment in warm blooded animals, especially mammals e.g.mouse, rat, cat, dog, rabbit, etc. . In using as antitumor agents, they may be administered orally or parenterally either as they are or in the powder, granule, tablet, capsule, suppository or injection form, for instance, which can be prepared in the conventional manner by using pharmacologically acceptable carriers, excipients, diluents and so forth. The dose depends on the animal to be treated, the condition and severity of the disease, the kind of the compound, the route of administration and other factors, and generally amounts to about 10 to 200 mg kg of body weight per day as compound I2 for oral administration or about 10 to 100 mg kg of body weight per day as compound I for parenteral administration. Furthermore, the compounds I and salts thereof have antiviral and antimicrobial activities against various viruses and microbes. Since they have low toxicity as mentioned above, they can therefore be used as antiviral agents, antimicrobial agents or disinfectants for the prevention and treatment of viral and bacterial infectious diseases in warm blooded animals, especially in mammals e.g. mouse, rat, cat, dog, rabbit,human . In using the compounds I or salts thereof as microbicides or disinfectants, the compounds I or salts thereof may be incorporated into water, an aqueous solution such as isotonic glucose solution or Ringer solution, or a nonaqueous medium such as a vegetable fatty oil e.g.cotton seed, peanut, corn or sesame oil in a concentration of about 0.5 to 500 mg ml. The liquid preparation can be applied to the hand, foot, ear and other parts of mammals for sterilization and disinfection of the application sites. The compounds I or salts thereof can also be used orally in the form of tablets containing about 0.5 to 500 mg thereof together with excipients such as lactose, starch or talc in the prevention and treatment of viral and bacterial infectious diseases in mammals. In that case, the dose is 10 to 200 mg kg of body weight per day on the compound I basis. The compound II , which is a starting material in practicing the method of the invention, can be produced, for example, according to the reaction processes shown below.EMI11.1 In Step A, the compound IV can be converted to the reaction product V by reacting with a chlorinating agent e.g. thionyl chloride, phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorus pentachloride, oxalyl chloride, phthaloyl chloride in a compound IV chlorinating agent molar ratio of about 1 to 1 100 in the absence or presence of an appropriate solvent at about 500C to 1500C for about 30 minutes to about 10 hours. As the solvent usable in the above reaction, there may be mentioned benzene, toluene, xylene, methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2 dichloroethane, 1,1,2 trichloroethane, 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane and acetonitrile, among others. When dimethylaniline, diethylaniline, triethylamine, dimethylformamide or the like is added, the above reaction may possibly be carried out under relatively mild conditions. The thionation in Step B can be effected by bringing the compound V into contact with a thionating agent e.g.hydrogen sulfide, sodium sulfide, thiourea in a compound V thionating agent molar ratio of about 1 to 1 20 in an inert solvent, generally at about 20 C to 1500C, for about 30 minutes to one day. Usable solvents are water, alcohols e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, secbutanol, tert butanol, ethylene glycol, methoxyethanol ethoxyethanol , ethers e.g. dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, monoglyme, diglyme , halogenated hydrocarbons te.g. dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride , acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, and adequate mixtures of these. The compound II can be produced by condensation of the compound VI with the compound VII in the presence of formaldehyde or an equivalent thereto Step C . The compound VI and compound VII may be used in a salt form. Such salt may be of the same kind as mentioned hereinabove with respect to the mineral acid salt or organic acid salt of the compound I . Said equivalent to formaldehyde includes reagents capable of behaving as an formaldehyde equivalent in theMannich reaction, such as paraformaldehyde, formalin, methylal, ethylal, piperidinomethylphthalimide and hexamethylenetetramine. In Step D, the compound II can be produced by reacting the compound VI with the compound VII in a VII VI molar ratio of about 1 to 50 in the absence or presence of an appropriate solvent at a temperature of from about OOC to the boiling point of the solvent used, preferably within the range of about 20 to 1000C, for about 10 minutes to about 48 hours and then treating the reaction mixture with an acid. Usable solvents include water, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetonitrile, pyridine, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, sulfolane, and adequate mixtures of these. The rate of reaction and the yield can be increased by adjusting the reactant mixture to an optimal pH generally about 2 to 10 with an acid e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, boric acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, camphorsulfonic acid , a base e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, ammonia, triethylamine or a salt e.g. sodium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, ammonium chloride .As the acid to be used in the final acid treatment, there may be mentioned, for instance, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, boric acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid and p toluenesulfonic acid. The compound II can be isolated from the reaction mixture in an adequate manner by any or any combination of usual separation and or purification methods, such as concentration, solvent extraction, recrystallization and chromatography. When the compound II obtained in this way is in the free form, it may be converted to a salt form by the conventional method for use as a starting compound in practicing the method of the invention. The salt of compound II includes those salt forms as mentioned hereinabove with respect to the compound 11.
