# Improvements in instruments with toothed cutting blades.

## Abstract
This invention relates to instruments with toothed cutting blades, and in particular, to non rotary cutting instruments of this kind, such as saws, files, sickles and the like. In particular a non rotary cutting tool according to the invention has a toothed cutting blade in which the tooth spacing is closer at one or both ends than in the middle, so that the region or regions of closer spacing correspond to slower cutting speeds in normal use of the tool.

## Claims
1. A non rotary cutting tool having a toothed cutting blade in which the tooth spacing is closer at one or both ends than in the middle, the region or regions of closer spacing corresponding to slower cutting speeds in normal use of the tool.

## Description
The present invention relates to instruments with toothed cutting blades, and in particular, to non rotary cutting instruments of this kind, such as saws, files, sickles and the like. Usually the user of such an instrument selects one with a coarse or fine tooth spacing according to the nature of the material on which he is workihg. The tooth spacing is usually uniform from end to end of the instrument, or is in a uniformly repeating pattern along the length of the instrument, with, for example, larger gaps being left for the clearance of sawdust. The present invention depends on the appreciation that the optimum tooth spacing of a cutting tool is related to cutting speed, and that in normal use, the cutting speed varies as the position of the tool blade relative to the work piece changes. Therefore, according to the present invention, a non rotary cutting tool has a toothed cutting blade in which the tooth spacing is closer at one or both ends than in the middle, the region or regions of closer spacing corresponding to slower cutting speeds in normal use of the tool. The tooth spacing may be graded from one region to another, or the cutting edge may consist of a number of sections, each provided with teeth at a uniform spacing, different for the various sections. The depths of the teeth may be uniform throughout but preferably the depths are proportional to the spacing. The invention will be further described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Reference Figures A and B illustrate mechanical and manual hacksaws in use, together with diagrams showing speeds of operation, and Reference Figure C shows the tooth arrangement of a prior art timber saw. Referring now to the drawings, Figure 1 shows a hacksaw, the blade of which has closely spaced teeth 1 at the end towards the tension nut, increasing gradually to a much wider tooth spacing and size towards the middle of the blade 2, and again diminishing in size and spacing towards the handle 3. Figure 2 shows a file having a similar gradation of tooth spacing, being close towards the tip 1, wider in the middle 2, and close again in the region 3 near the handle tang. Figure 3 shows a sawblade for use in a reciprocating mechanical saw bench such as is shown in Reference Figure A. The speed of movement of the saw over the work varies sinusoidally, as is shown in the small sketch in Reference Figure A, and the tooth spacing and depth in Figure 3 vary in correspondence with this being finest at the ends 1 and 3 and coarsest in the middle 2. Figure 4a shows a saw blade in which the teeth are in five sections, 5,6,7,8 and 9, the spacing being uniform within each section but diminishing from the outer section 5 through the intermediate section 6 to the central section 7, which is coarsest, and then becoming finer through the intermediate section 8 to the other end section 9. Figure 4b shows a precisely similar principle as applied to a file, each section being correspondingly numbered. Figures 5a and 5b show a simplified form of the invention, in which there only two difference spacings, as applied respectively to a sawblade and a file. In each case the section 10, further from the handle has finer teeth, and the section 11 nearer the handle has coarser teeth. Figure 6 shows the invention as applied to a sickle. In this case the arrangement of the teeth is the reverse of that shown in Figures 5a and 5b because of the different manner of use of the tool, the faster cutting speed being at the beginning of the stroke, which starts near the handle, therefore the finer teeth 12 are nearest to the handle, and the coarser teeth 13 further from it. Figure 7 shows a saw blade in which the tooth spacing is graded, but the more widely spaced teeth are correspondingly deeper, so that the tooth shape is similar throughout. Figure 8 shows a keyhole saw, Figure 9 a double edged handsaw, and Figure 10 a bow saw, all employing the present invention.
