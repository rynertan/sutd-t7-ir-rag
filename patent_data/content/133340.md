# Zone stiffened composites.

## Abstract
A composite article comprises an elastomeric matrix incor porating reinforcing fibres, and at least one distinct zone of a polymeric stiffening material. The elastomeric matrix and the polymeric material are co polymerised within a transition region to provide an exceptionally strong chemical bond, and a graded transition from one material to the other. The stiffen ing material may also contain reinforcing fibres. A number of possible materials are disclosed, as well as several articles of specific form in accordance with the invention. The articles expressly disclosed are an automobile bumper, Figs 1 3 , drive couplings Figs 4 8 , an automotive constant velocity joint Fig. 9 , helicopter rotor couplings Figs 10 15 , an integral tyre and wheel Fig. 16 , and a spring of zig zag form Figs 18 20 .
