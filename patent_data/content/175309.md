As the carbon source, carbohydrates such as glucose, sucrose, molasses, starch hydrolysate, or cellulose hydrolysate derived fran the dregs of juice or fruit, pulp or paper, organic acid such as acetic acid, alcohol such as ethanol, hydnxarbons, etc., can be used. In the invention molasses can be preferably used. As the nitrogen source, ammonia gas, organic ammonium compound such as ammonium acetate, inorganic ammonium compound such as ammonium sulfate or ammonium chloride, urea, etc., can be used. As the inorganic salt, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, potassium monohydrogen phosphate, magnesium sulfate, ferrous sulfate, calcium carbonate, etc., can be used. As a nutrient, natural organic nutrients such as vitamins, amino acids, corn steep liquor, meat extract, yeast extract, peptone or soy bean hydrolysate can be preferably used.Cultivation is carried out under aerobic conditions at a temperature of from 240C to 400C for 2 to 7 days.During cultivation the pH of the medium is adjusted to 5.5 to 8.5 by alkali or acid or calcium carbonate or gaseous ammonia.The carbon source is in general preferably added by the so called feeding method. In this case, L lysine is usually accumulated in the medium after 2 to 5 days. L lysine in the culture broth thus obtained can be separated by known methods such as by using ion exchange resins or other conventional methods, after removal of the microbial cells by filtration or centrifuging. Depending on the kind of medium, L lysine can be directly obtained in the form of crystals from the me dium. The invention will be more clearly understood with reference to the following Examples.
