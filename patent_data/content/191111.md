# Improvements to pulling processes and equipment for growing silicon crystals having high and controlled carbon content.

## Abstract
Silicon crystals with high and controlled carbon content can be grown by controlling the oxygen leakage during the melting in standard Czochralski silicon crystal pullers. Carbon concentration profile of grown crystals can be deduced from the carbon monoxide concentration CO real time monitoring, through its integral taken during the whole pulling duration.
