## Description
PROCESS FOR EXPANSION OF TOBACCOBackground of the Invention The present invention relates to a process for increasing the filling power of tobacco. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for expanding tobacco which includes overwetting the tobacco with water and rapidly overdrying the overwetted tobacco in a turbulent steam atmosphere. The heretofore known expansion processes may be broadly characterized as involving penetration or impregnation of the tobacco with a blowing or puffing agent, sometimes referred to hereinafter as an impregnant , which when removed during a subsequent expansion step generates elevated pressure in the tobacco and thereby causes expansion of the cell volume. The impregnant may be a solid, a liquid, or a gas. Among the impregnants which have been employed are pressurized steam, air, water, organic solvents, ammonia, carbon dioxide, combinations of ammonia and carbon dioxide, and compounds capable of liberating a gas when subjected to chemical decomposition, as by heating.Where gases or other chemicals are utilized to cause or aid in expansion, physio chemical changes may occur in the tobacco. Among the means disclosed for removing the impregnant to expand the cell volume are a sudden reduction in pressure, freeze drying, convection heating, radiant transfer, and the application of a microwave field. However, some of the aforementioned processes provide only a low level of expansion. Processes employing water as an impregnant have tended to produce a more satisfactory result with tobacco stems than with tobacco lamina filler. It may be that the greater permeability of the leaf structure permits the water impregnant to escape before substantial expansion can take place. Removal of the water impregnant has typically been effected by such techniques as freeze drying or exposure to a microwave field. Freeze drying is a comparatively slow and expensive approach and may result, in some instances, in a product which has an objectionable amount of tackiness because of the hygroscopicity of a film like layer of water extracted solids which forms on the surface of the tobacco. The use of a microwave field requires elaborate and expensive equipment and may tend to be more effective with tobacco stems than with tobacco lamina filler. Many of the prior art processes possess various disadvantages, most of which can be generally categorized as requiring prolonged treatment, batch processing and high energy usage. The process of the present invention offers advantages over many of these prior art processes and does not require foreign agents or chemical additives to achieve the objective of significantly increased filling power by expansion of the tobacco, which may be cut filler or the like.Definitions Oven Volatiles OV As used herein, oven volatiles is the percent weight loss of tobacco in a circulating air oven in three hours at 1000C. OV is used herein to mean the moisture content of the tobacco. Filling Power As used herein, filling power is the ability of the material to provide a firm rod. The filling power is the minimum weight of tobacco which will produce a tobacco rod of specified dimensions and firmness and may be measured as the volume occupied by a specified weight of filler in an upright cylinder when a specified piston weight is applied to its top surface, as set forth in FillingVolume of Cut Tobacco and Cigarette Hardness , H. Wakeham, et al., Tobacco Science xx 164 167, 1976. Standard equilibrium conditions for measurement of filling power are usually 60 relative humidity RH at 750F 23.9cC . Cylinder Volume CV As used herein, cylinder volume is a measurement of filling power and is determined by placing 10.0 grams of filler in a standard metal cylinder, 3.358 cm. in diameter, and vibrating the assembly for one half minute to settle the tobacco column. The tobacco is then carpressed under a piston weighing 1875 grams and having a diameter of 3.335 cn, for five minutes and the volume reading is then taken. The standard deviation of the cylinder voling ireasuresent is about 1.5 .Summary of the Invention The present invention provides a process for expanding tobacco by means of overwetting the tobacco to a moisture content of at least 20 and then overdrying the tobacco in a period of a few seconds in a turbulent steam atmosphere to a moisture content below the moisture content normally encountered in processing. It has been determined that such overdrying must occur to a moisture content of less than 7 to achieve increased filling power.Description of Preferred Embodiments According to the process of the present invention, tobacco lamina or cut tobacco filler is moisturized to a moisture content of at least 20 which is above the moisture level of unprocessed tobacco and appreciably above the normal 12 processingmoisturelevel of tobacco. It has been found that when tobacco having a moisture content above 20 is treated according to the process of the present invention, significant increases in filling power are achieved. At a moisture content of 20 , expansion may also be attained by rapidly overdrying the tobacco according to the process of the present invention, but the chemical and physical properties of the tobacco will have a greater influence on the effectiveness of the process. Preferably, the moisture content of the tobacco is from 20 to about 80 , and more preferably from about 30 to about 80 , although moisture contents within the range of 20 to about 40 are effectively employed.Moisture contents of about 60 to about 80 may be effectively employed, but penetration or bulking time will probably increase and drying the tobacco within the desired times and to the desired post treatment moisture levels will be more expensive and time consuming. It is desired that the moisture be allowed to substantially uniformly penetrate and be distributed or dispersed throughout the cellular structure of the tobacco being processed, although homogeneous dispersion is not required. The bulking penetration time for satisfactory penetration will depend upon batch size and upon the means of addition of the water and the desired economics.Employing a rotary cylinder and a fine mist spray or other conventional mixing system known in the art for incorporating additives, a penetration time of 4 hours or somewhat less will be sufficient, as is further illustrated in Example 5.The primary criterion is that the time of penetration be sufficient to allow the moisture to be distributed within and absorbed by the tobacco cellular structure of substantial portions of the tobacco. Typically, the overwetted tobacco is bulked from about 1 4 hour to about 4 hours. As previously stated, after penetration of the moisture throughout the tobacco structure, the tobacco is overdried in a period of a few seconds in a turbulent steam atmosphere. The term overdrying in the context of the present invention means drying the overwetted tobacco to a moisture content below the moisture contents typically encountered and utilized in the processing of tobacco. The normal or conventional moisture content of tobacco to be processed, particularly that of commonly used tobacco filler, is usually approximately about 12 to about 21 . Rapid drying of the tobacco, preferably within less than 5 seconds, in a turbulent steam atmosphere to a moisture content of less than 7 expands the tobacco as the moisture rapidly escapes the tobacco cellular structure.The cellular structure of the tobacco fibers thereupon stiffen to retain the expanded nature of the tobacco during remoisturization to normal processing moisture contents. Preferably, the tobacco is dried to a moisture content of less than 5 and more preferably to a moisture content of less than 3 , with drying to a moisture content of 2 to 3 being particularly preferred. Steam drying versus air drying produces substantial gains in filling power as will be noted from Example 2. To achieve and retain the desired expansion, it has been found that the more rapid the drying, the more effective the process. In effect, an almost immediate evaporation of the moisture is sought. Drying times of 5 seconds or less are desired to achieve a 2 to 5 moisture content, if not even a lower moisture content. The more rapid the drying step, the more rapid the evolution of the moisture and the more effective the expansion Residence times longer than 5 seconds do not appear to produce the desired expansion levels. To rapidly overdry the tobacco, a high turbulence drying unit such as a Proctor Schwartz dispersion dryer, or a Jetstream dryer or other equivalent drying tower, capable of producing a turbulent atmosphere high in steam content, may be utilized. The proportion of steam in the turbulent steam drying atmosphere is desirably at least about 60 , and preferably at least about 80 although steam contents of about 60 to about 70 can be effectively employed. With regard to the treatment temperature, that is, the temperature of the turbulent steam atmosphere in the drying unit, at temperatures of at least about 2320C and employing properly designed and reasonably efficient equipment which allows rapid drying of the moisturized tobacco in a period of seconds, the moisture content of the overwetted tobacco may be reduced to less than about 5 to produce economically significant increases in filling power. Rapid drying in a turbulent steam atmosphere at a treatment temperature of at least about 3160C, and preferably from about 3160C to about 3300C provides substantial increases in filling power.As will be seen in Example 3, treatment temperatures of about 1210C provide little useful increase in filling power temperatures from about 1490C to about 2040C provide perceptible gains in filling power temperatures from about 2320C to about 2880C provide moderate increases in filling power, and temperature of from about 2880C to about 3160C provide significant increases in filling power. Further, in accordance with the practice of the present invention, turbulent steam atmospheres having temperatures as high as 5000C. may be successfully utilized. Subsequent to overdrying, the tobacco is preferably remoisturized under mild conditions, by means and processes well known in the industry for reordering tobacco, such as cylinder reordering, to achieve a processing moisture content of about 12 . The reordering should be at a moderate rate to prevent loss of expanded fiber rigidity. The following examples present illustrative but non limiting embodiments of the present invention. Comparative examples are also presented. Example 1 Five pounds of bright cut filler were placed in a small rotary cylinder and sprayed with a fine water mist until the moisture content was raised to 30 water by weight The filler was allowed to bulk for 4 hours and was then dried in a steam atmosphere in a high turbulence drying tower at 3160C for 4 seconds. The rapidly dried filler was allowed to equilibrate for 18 hours at 210C and 60 RH after which OV and CV measurements were taken and compared to an untreated control. The results are summarized below in Table 1.

The results of these runs are summarized below in Table 4 and indicate that the desired increases in filling power are achieved with tobacco overwetted to moisture contents in excess of 20 .

Example 6 Fifty pounds of bright filler were processed as in Example 1. The processed filler, after reordering, had a filling power of 56 cc lOg, corrected to 12 moisture.Cigarettes were made in which 15 of the conventional filler was replaced by the processed filler and the subjective qualities of these cigarettes were compared with those of standard production cigarettes. There were no major subjective differences and the cigarettes containing the 15 expanded tobacco were found to be equally satisfying and to have full flavor. It will be understood that the particular embodiments of the invention described above in Examples 1 through 6 are only illustrative of the principles of the invention, and that various modifications can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.
