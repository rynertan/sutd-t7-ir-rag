# Metallization of ceramics.

## Abstract
An Article comprised of metal directly and adherently bonded onto a ceramic substrate, and a process for produc ing same, are described, wherein the ceramic is adhesion promoted with molten inorganic compounds, treated with compounds that promote adsorption of species rendering said surfaces receptive for metal deposition, and plated with metal. Uniform surface coverage with said species and metal is achieved by the treatment with the adsorption promoting compounds.
