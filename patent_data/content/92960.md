# Apparatus for checking and correcting digital data.

## Abstract
Coding and decoding apparatus generates check digits or syndrome digits using a cyclic redundancy code based on a polynomial of degree m from an input of information digits taking them w at a time. In the simplest case shown in Figure 1, m is equal to w, and m information digits are transferred to a register 22 through a set of m exclusive OR gates 20 . The register addresses a memory 24 holding a look up table whose output provides the other inputs of the exclusive OR gate 20 at each successive step, until the whole of the input information digits have been fed into the apparatus. To avoid an excessively large look up table, the table may be subdivided into n smaller tables, each of width m n. In a modification, where m is an integral multiple of w, the w information digits are applied to the most significant stages of the register, and the look up table is of width w.
