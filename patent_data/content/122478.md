## Description
The invention relates to a monoclonal antibody with specificityfor crosslinked fibrin derivatives, a method for the preparationthereof and an assay procedure using said antibody. Fibrinogen is a large protein molecule thatnormally circulates in blood plasma in a dissolved state.Under attack from an enzyme thrombin the fibrinogen moleculeslink up, spontaneously aligning themselves into the long threadlikepolymer or network called fibrin which is the primaryingredient of blood clots. It has been discovered that upon digestion withan enzyme called plasmin which functions in the blood todestroy the fibrin network and restores the fluidity of theplasma fibrinogen breaks down into fragments designatedA E. Fragments D and E make up the bulk of the recoveredmass, and there is about twice as much D as there is of E.Fibrinogen also has been discovered to have a trinodularshape wherein E is a central component and D is a terminalcomponent. Plasmin digests of fibrin and fibrinogen can bedifferentiated from each other using polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis PAGE . Crosslinking of fibrin with anenzyme called Factor XIIIa forms dimers of fragment D calledD dimer. Factor XIIIa is an enzyme which introduces covalentbonds between adjacent monomers in fibrin and thus may stabilizethe fibrin structure. For a more detailed explanationof the nature of the crosslinking between fibrin monomerswe refer to Budzynski et al,Blood,Vol 54,No. 4 October 1979.Factor XIIIa is activated by the thrombin catalyzed removalof a peptide from a precursor in the plasma and in bloodplatelets. D dimer is a molecule of about 189,000 daltonswhich consists essentially of two fragment D moieties derivedfrom different fibrin molecules covalently bound by crosslinkbonds between the gamma chain remnants of fibrinogen. Fibrinogen itself comprises 6 chains with two copiesof an alpha, beta and gamma chain. Another complex DD E is formed by plasmindegradation of crosslinked human fibrin and comprises acombination of two D fragments and fragment E. Other crosslinked derivatives may be preparedas described in an article from Seminars in Thrombosisand Hemostasis,Vol 8, No. 1 1982 entitled Detection andRelevance of Crosslinked Fibrin Derivatives in Blood byGraeff and Halfer. These include high molecular weightcrosslinked derivatives and may be referred to in the abovereference as derivatives DY, YY, XD, XY, DXD and YXD. Normal haemostasis or coagulation of blood involvesmaintaining intravascular constituents in a liquid phaseor suspension while concomitantly permitting local depositionof solid phase blood components in areas of vessel damage.In health it has been assumed, but never experimentallydemonstrated, that a balance exists between a low gradeintravascular deposition of fibrin and its removal byfibrinolysis or cellular phagocytosis. Early clinical observations revealed that someseverely ill patients developed signs of haemorrhage andmassive bruising and had prolonged clotting times andthrombocytopenia. At postmortem, in some cases, fibrinthrombi were demonstrated in the microvasculature. Thediffuse nature of these thrombi gave rise to the termdisseminated intravascular coagulation DIC . Subsequently,coagulation factors were shown to be reduced. Thesefindings give rise to the concept of consumptive coagulopathy ,a term sometimes used as a synonym for DIC. The currently accepted sequence of events in DICinvolves activation of the coagulation system resulting inplatelet consumption, thrombin generation, fibrin deposition,and secondary fibrinolysis. The net biologic effect of thisprocess reflects a balance between fibrin deposition and fibrin clearance. The resulting clinical manifestations maybe haemorrhage,when depletion of coagulation factors predominates,or ischemic tissue damage due to the effects ofvascular occlusion. DIC has been reported as a secondary phenomenonin a wide variety of disorders, particularly those accompaniedby a combination of shock, acidosis, and hypoxemia.The well recognized clinical associations are sepsis, majortrauma, malignancy, and obstetric disorders. In theseclinical settings activation of the coagulation sequenceresults in consumption of coagulation protein and platelets,leading to fibrin deposition in the micro circulation.The precise factors that initiate the DIC are unknown, butmany potential mechanisms have been demonstrated in animalexperiments. Ideally a definitive diagnosis of DIC should requirethe direct demonstration of diffuse fibrin deposition. Thepractical difficulty of obtaining multiple direct biopsyevidence to differentiate between localized and generalizedfibrin formation has led to the development of indirecttests that are substituted as diagnostic end points. Howeverthese tests are not specific for the syndrome of intravascularfibrin deposition. Their specificity is further reduced bythe action of other enzymes that although not able to convertfibrinogen to fibrin can cause similar alterations to thrombinon the other coagulation factors involved in thrombosis. Allof the indirect tests are based on the principle that thrombinis the only enzyme snake venoms excluded capable of convertingfibrinogen to fibrin in man. Also apart from the paracoagulation tests thatdetect the presence of circulating soluble fibrin monomercomplexes, none of the more specific thrombin specific testsis readily available or useful for immediate clinicalapplication in the diagnosis of clinical DIC. These testsinclude the FPA fibrinopeptide A test where FPA ismeasured by a specific RIA procedure, fibrin monomer assays,fibrinogen gel exclusion chromatography and tests for FPB fibrinopeptide B or thrombin increasable FPB. Tests with biochemical nonspecificity for thrombinaction include the prothombin time PT ,thromboplastintime A PTT and thrombin clotting time TCT tests. Althoughfrequently useful in practice it must be recognized thatinformation obtained from these tests is nonspecific innature, acting as a measure of clotting factor depletionregardless of etiology. Coagulation factor assays have also been found tobe relatively non specific and these include assays forcofactors V and VIII as well as tests for fibrinogen levels. Tests for fibrin fibrinogen degradation productsso far have not proved to be specific for the action of plasminon fibrin and may yield positive results where there has beenfibrinogenolysis without prior thrombin action on the fibrinogenmolecule. These tests include tests for fragments D andE. Tests for thrombin mediated platelet interactionor release have been found to be nonspecific in nature. Theseinclude platelet count, platelet survival and tests ofplatelet release. The use of radio labelled fibrinogen in relationto identifying clotting factors have also been attemptedbut found to be time consuming and difficult to perform. Thus, in summary of the prior art, the efficacyof a For these reasons, sensitivity, specificity, andpredictive values cannot be determined in a standard fashion.The clinical presentation of the disorder is complex andunpredictable. The application of the available tests fordiagnosis are therefore best considered in relation to thedifferent clinical syndromes of intravascular coagulation. In Fibrinogen Structure, Functional Aspects, Metabolism,Vol. 2 pages 227 233, 1983 Walter de Gruiter Co, Berlin New York monoclonal antibodies are described,which aredirected to crosslinked fibrin degradation products andfibrinogen degradation products D and E. It has also been proposed to assay for D dimeras a diagnostic test for A useful summary of DIC and conventional diagnostictests will be found in Seminars in Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Vol 8,No. 3 1982 and in an article entitled DIC, The Applicationand Utility of Diagnostic Tests by Ockelford and Carter The above mentioned Budzynski referencedescribes the study of polyclonal anti D dimer antibodies usingtwo different antisera. In this test antibodies were raisedagainst specific markers on the D dimer molecule. In the testantisera were obtained in chicken and rabbits against a mixture 1 1 of D The above mentioned Graeff and Hafter article alsopoints out that crosslinked fibrin derivatives in bloodsuch as D dimer may be considered as a marker for DIC.However, there is nothing in this article to demonstratethat a reliable diagnostic test for DIC could be devisedbased on crosslinked fibrin derivatives. It is therefore an object of the present inventionto provide an assay procedure for crosslinked fibrin derivativeswhich may be used on a clinical basis. The object of the invention is solved byproviding a monoclonal antibody as defined in Claims 1 and2. The invention further provides a method of preparation ofsaid monoclonal antibody derived from a cross linked fibrinderivative including the steps of In step i a suitable antigenic extract could beobtained from plasmic degradation of fibrin clots or bysimultaneous action of thrombin, Factor XIIIa and plasmin onfibrinogen with transient clot formation and subsequent clotlysis. In the latter method the fibrinogen is converted tofibrin by the action of thrombin and Factor XIIIa andsubsequently digested with plasmin. It will of course beappreciated that the fibrin derivative or extract containingsame may be obtained from a human or other suitable animalsource. The above methods of obtaining the crude antigenicfraction are in vitro methods. A suitable in vivo methodwould be to obtain sera or other body fluid containing thecrosslinked fibrin derivative from an animal including humansand subject the body fluid to a PAGE process wherein substantiallypure crosslinked fibrin derivative may be isolated. Alternatively crosslinked fibrin derivatives couldbe purified from serum obtained from patients suffering severethrombotic disorders based on a technique using gel filtrationin combination with ion exchange chromatography as describedin Willner et al Biochemistry When using a pure crosslinked fibrin derivative suchas D dimer, care must be taken in its preparation to notdenature the molecule as it is susceptible to denaturationfairly easily. For a more complete description of the above mentionedmethods in preparing an antigenic extract which is usuallyof a crude nature reference may be made to the above mentionedGraeff and Hafter article. Suitable crosslinked fibrinderivatives for use in the invention may be any one of thosepreviously described, but preferably the derivative is D In step ii a suitable animal to which thederivative or extract thereof may be administered is a mouseor rat. A mouse is preferred. It is also preferred toadminister crude extract one or more times initially andfollow this up with administration of pure or substantiallypure crosslinked fibrin derivative. This procedure ispreferred so that the task of obtaining monoclonal antibodiesspecific to the derivative is simplified. After administration the mice which have hadderivative or extract administered thereto are suitablykilled and the spleens removed for subsequent processing toform a cell suspension. Further purification of the cellsuspension may take place eg. by centrifugation to isolatespleen white blood cells or lymphocytes which may be fusedwith mouse myeloma cells. The cloning technique may be broadly based on thetechnique described in Galfre et al Nature Preferably for the cultivation of hybridoma cellswell plates are utilized wherein cell suspensions are placedin each well with appropriate cell cultivation media. It is preferred to remove samples of cells forscreening assays and these may be carried out as describedhereinafter. A number of the strongest growth wells are suitably chosen for maintenance on the basis of the Screeningassays. After the screening assays it is possible to choosea number of specific antibody producing clonotypes toproduce monoclonal antibody secreting cell lines by limitingdilution. On the basis of further screening assays carriedout on samples taken from well plates incorporating thelimiting dilution clonotypes a number of specific antibodyproduced clones may be chosen for expansion to mass culture. A suitable Suitably in step a a well plate may be utilizedin which crosslinked fibrin derivative such as D dimerand or fibrinogen degradation product preferably obtainedfrom a procedure wherein fibrinogen was suitably digestedwith thrombin to obtain fragment D, fragment E and optionallyfragments X and Y was applied to the individual wells. Subsequently monoclonal antibody derived from acrosslinked fibrin derivative was then added to each well.An appropriate signal amplification step which may be appliedis an EIA step wherein an appropriate enzyme conjugate maybe coupled to the complex and substrate subsequently added.Alternatively RIA, FIA, agglutination, adherance or chemiluminescencemay be used as appropriate signal amplificationsteps. The purpose of the screening assay procedure referredto above is to ensure that the cells being tested are producingantibody specific to the relevant crosslinked fibrin derivative,but not to fragment D. The invention also includes within its scope anassay procedure for detection of the presence of a crosslinked fibrin derivative including the steps of In the abovementioned assay the crosslinked fibrinderivative is suitably D dimer, D The single amplification step may be any one ofthose already described in relation to the screening assayprocedure but is suitably EIA. The presence of the crosslinked fibrin derivativemay be used as a suitable diagnostic aid for prethrombotic,thrombotic or other conditions that involve the formationand lysis of fibrin. The assay of the invention ray also be used formonitoring lytic therapy such as streptokinese therapy andtissue plasminogen activator therapy TPA . An exampleof a prethrombotic state is a stress condition. Examplesof thrombotic states include DIC, pulmonary embolus, thrombosis,invasive tumours and other thrombotic states describedhereinafter. The fluid sample may be obtained from any suitablebody fluid such as lymph, serum, plasma or exudate. The assay procedure may be performed using a tube,well plate or micro plate as described previously or may becarried out in any other suitable manner including conventionalprocedures. A stick procedure using a singleelongate member may be utilized wherein Ag or Ab is initiallycoated thereon before application of steps b and c . In another embodiment of the invention the monoclonalantibodies can be covalently attached to small beads. Suchbeads enable a quick e.g. 2 3 minute test to be carried outin serum plasma or other body fluids for the presence ofcrosslinked fibrin derivatives. The beads may be formedfrom polystyrene, nylon, glass or other suitable material.In relation to polystyrene, the MAb can be coupled theretousing the carbodiimide method as described in Molday et.al J,Cell Bio It will of course be appreciated that assaysbased on capture tag techniques wherein a first MAb iscaptured by an antigen which is subsequentially taggedby a labelled second MAb where the label may be suitablyused in an EIA or RIA test may be used in relation to thisinvention. However, in some cases assays based on use of asingle MAb may be used such as the above mentioned bead orlatex assays. In relation to an assay for a specific crosslinkedfibrin derivative it has been found that of all the MAbstested a number were discovered to be panspecific ie. bindingto epitopes or reactive sites on fibrin breakdown productsas well as fibrinogen breakdown products and others weremonospecific ie binding only to reactive sites on D dimerand other crosslinked fibrin derivatives . When capture tag experiments were carried out asdiscussed hereinafter in one type of assay a monospecificMAb was bound to a support surface and was tested with serumor other body fluid suspected of containing crosslinkedfibrin derivative. When tagged with a second antibody whichwas a panspecific MAb attached to an appropriate label usedin the signal amplification step this provided a preciseassay for crosslinked fibrin derivative if the panspecificMAb bound to an epitope in the sample. In a variation of this technique a panspecificMAb could be bound to a support surface and tested with bodyfluid suspected of containing the crosslinked fibrin derivative.Subsequently a monospecific MAb could be tagged to thebody fluid antigen having a suitable label attached thereto. In another version it is also possible to binda first monospecific MAb to a support surface and test samewith a sample of body fluid suspected of containing a crosslinkedfibrin derivative. Subsequently a second monospecificMAb could be tagged to the body fluid antigen having asuitable label attached thereto, In the following experiments human fibrinogen andpurified fragments D, E and D dimer were prepared as describedabove in the Wilner reference. Fibrinogen degradation productswere prepared as described in Thromb.Res Spleens were removed aseptically from 2 immunizedmice killed by cervical dislocation three days after aninjection of D dimer. Previously the mice had beenimmunized with three injections of fibrin lysate digestedwith proteolytic enzymes thrombin and plasmin as reported.in the aforementioned Graeff and Hafter reference. Twospleens were placed in a 60 mm Petri dish Falcon, 3001,Oxnard, Calif. containing 5 ml complete medium 85 RPMI1640, 15 foetal calf serum, 100 I.U. ml penicillin, 100µg ml streptomycin and 2X10 The cell suspension was allowed to stand for 5 minutesat room temperature to allow smaller clumps and membranefragments to settle before transferring the cell suspensionto a fresh Falcon 2001 tube. The cells were centrifugedat 350G for 5 minutes at room temperature and the supernatantwas decanted from the first cell pellet to a fresh tube andspun at 700G for five minutes to give a second cell pelletand the two pellets were pooled and resuspended in 5 mlcomplete medium. The spleen white blood cells SWBC werethen counted and their viability estimated by Turks and Trypanblue stains respectively, and 100X10 Twenty five X 10 The 1 fusion plates were then placed in a humidified5 CO One 2 well of each chosen clonotype was resuspendedand the number of viable cells per well was estimated by Trypanblue exclusion. Immediately before plating each clonotype,the relevant series of dilutions were made in HT mediumor complete medium if the cells were older than 28 days postfusion to give a frequency of 0.5 cells 0.05 ml. Thisvolume was then added with a Tridak stepper to each well ofa 96 well flat bottomed tissue culture plate Flow Laboratories,Mississauga, Ontario, Canada L D plate containing 1X10 Alternatively if it was desired to obtain a largeamount of MAb, female BALB c mice were given anintraperitoneal injection of 0,5 ml 2, 5, 10, 14, tetramethylpentadecane Pristane, Aldrich Chemical Corp., Milwaukee,Wisconsin 14 days prior to the injection of 2x10 The wells of a 96 well U bottomed microtest plate Disposable Products Pty. Ltd., Adelaide, South Australia were coated by adding 50µl of either D dimer 5 µg ml orFibrinogen degradation products 5 µg ml in PBS for onehour at room temperature 25 C . Excess antigen was removedby inverting and tapping the plate and the plate was thenwashed three times with PBS containing 0.05 Tween 20 Sigma Chemical Corp., St Louis, Missouri . Clones secretingMAb to D dimer or Fibrinogen degradation products were thendetected by adding 50 µl of tissue culture supernatant toeach well and incubating for one hour at room temperature.Unbound MAB was removed by inversion and tapping and theplate was washed three times with PBS Tween. One hundredµl of a Conjugation of the D dimer monoclonal antibodieswas carried out by a modification of the method of Nakaneand Kaiwoi, J. of Histochem and Cytochem Protein determination was carried out by the methodof Rylatt and Parish Analytical Biochem, Antigen capture tag experiments were performed byincubating each well of a 96 well microtitre plate with50 µl 10 µg ml of each of the relevant MAb in PBS for 1hour at room temperature. Unbound MAb was removed byinversion and tapping the plate followed by washing withPBS Tween as described for the screening assay. Antigencapture was then achieved by adding 50 µl of each antigen 0 1 mg ml in PBS Tween to the MAb coated wells for 1 hour at room temperature. The wells were washed as previouslydescribed. Captured antigen was then tagged with peroxidaseconjugated MAb by adding 50 µl 1 µg ml of the variousperoxidase conjugated MAb in PBS Tween to each well for onehour at room temperature After washing, the presence ofbound conjugate was determined by the addition of 100 µlsubstrate as described in the screening assay. For thedetermination of the presence of crosslinked derivatives inplasma or serum, 50 µl of a Several hundred hybridoma clones secreting MAb againsthuman D dimer were initially identified by enzyme immunoassayand two different classes of MAb were obtained TABLE 1 . The first group which contained the vast majority of positiveclones examples of which were B44.7.4D2 182 DD 4D2 182 ,B44.7.2C1 19 DD 2C1 19 , B41.7.2D5 38 DD 2D5 38 , producedMAb that bound to epitopes present on intact fibrinogen, anextract containing fibrinogen degradation products, fragmentD and D dimer. However, the abovementioned first group didnot bind to fragment E. The second and much smaller group examples of which were B42.7.3B6 22 DD 3B6 22 andB41.7.1C3 108 DD 1C3 108 , reacted with determinantspresent on D dimer but not on fragment D. No cross reaction was found with purifiedintact fibrinogen or fibrinogen degredation products. In order to establish whether the Various MAbwere reacting with the same or distinct sites on D dimer,capture tag experiments were carried out. The wells of a 96Well micro plate were coated with each MAb and incubated witheither fibrinogen breakdown products or D dimer. Afterwashing away unbound protein, peroxidase conjugated MAbwere added and after washing the presence of bound conjugatewas determined by the addition of activated substrate TABLE2 . This MAb was able to combine with the monospecificMAb DD lC3 108 or DD 3B6 22 only when D dimer was utilizedas antigen and the panspecific MAb DD 2D5 38 when eitherfibrinogen as degradation products of D dimer antigens wereused. It was unable to combine with the other panspecificMAb DD 4D2 182 with either antigen. These results suggestthat DD 2C1 19 binds close to the site recognized by DD 402 182but to epitopes quite distinct to those recognized byDD 2D5 38, DD lC3 108 or DD 3B6 22. The panspecific MAb DD 4D2 182 had a specificity patternanalogous to DD 2C1 19. The results suggest that DD 4D2 182and DD 2C1 19 may have very close or overlapping bindingsites. The panspecific MAb DD 2D5 38 was also able to combinewith DD 1C3 108 and DD 3B6 22 only when D dimer was used butwas capable of combining with both of the other panspecificMAb DD 4D2 182 and DD 2C1 19 with either D dimer or Fibrinogendegradation products as antigens. This monoclonal was theonly one of this series which was capable of combination withitself, suggesting the presence of at least two binding sitesper D dimer molecule. However, it is clear that these bindingsites must be distinct from the sites recognized by the otherfour monoclonals. The D dimer specific MAb DD 3B6 22 was capable ofcombining with any of the panspecific monoclonals DD 4D2 182,DD 2C1 19 or DD 2D5 38 when D dimer was the captured antigen. MAb DD 1C3 108 had a similar specificity pattern, howeverit performed relatively poorly as the capture MAb. Overallthe results suggest that this set of monoclonals bindsto three distinct areas on the D dimer molecule, a uniquesite recognized by DD 2D5 38, another shared by DD 402 182and DD 2C1 19 and a D dimer specific site shared by DD 1C3 108and DD 3B6 22. The results above suggested that several combinationsof these MAb might prove useful in developing a specific assayfor D dimer and perhaps lead to a general assay for fibrinolysis.In the first type of combination, the monospecific MAbDD 3B6 22 was used as a capture MAb and antigen was taggedwith either of the panspecific MAb DD 4D2 108 or DD 2D5 38.An assay using peroxidase conjugated DD 4D2 108 as a tag MAbhad a sensitivity of 10 20 ηg ml of D dimer Fig. 1 . Assays based on both these monoclonal combinationswere investigated for their ability to detect D dimer andother crosslinked derivatives in blood. Serum or plasmadiluted Latex particles are polystyrene beads approximately 1 micronin diameter to which has been covalently attached the monoclonalantibody DD 3B6 22. Positive agglutination was obtained with samplescontaining 200 ηg ml crosslinked derivative, Moreaccurate estimates of higher levels of crosslinked derivativesin a particular sample were obtained by serial dilutions ofthe sample in PBS buffer as illustrated in Fig 4. The groups studies were a 45 healthy laboratoryvolunteers as controls b 10 patients with venographicallyproven deep venous thrombosis and or arterial thrombosis c 6 patients with pulmonary embolism and d 30 patientswith laboratory evidence of consumption coagulopathy anddiagnoses characteristically associated with disseminatedintravascular coagulation. The patients in group d allfulfilled the criteria for disseminated intravascularcoagulation as described in Whaun and Oski Can. Med. Assc.J. Previous attempts to obtain specific antibodyprobes to discriminate crosslinked fibrin derivatives havebeen hampered by the nature of the polyclonal antibody responseto the antigens used for immunization. Several antibodypreparations have already been described with a markedpreference for the crosslinked derivative 50 fold greaterreactivity for D dimer compared to D see the aforementionedBudzynski reference or 100 fold for crosslinked γ γ chainscompared to non crosslinked and peptide Purves et al Biochemistry The problem of producing diagnostic reagents couldnot be overcome until monospecific MAb were produced DD 3B6 22 and DD 1C3 108 that reacted only with crosslinkedfibrin derivatives. These MAb have been employed to producediagnostic assays of which capture tag type systems arepreferred. However conventional binding inhibition assaysemploying labelled monospecific DD 3B6 22, DD 1C3 108 orlabelled crosslinked fibrin derivative could also be used. In a capture tag assay, the antigen in questionis reacted with two antibodies with specificity for differentregions of the same molecule. Usually a capture antibodyis attached onto a solid phase and after addition of antigento allow binding to occur, the presence of bound antigen canbe detected after washing by the addition of the secondlabelled antibody. MAb DD 1C3 108 although quite specific for D dimer,performed quite poorly as a capture MAb, yet the peroxidaseconjugated MAb was a good tag. On the other hand, the otherspecific monoclonal DD 3B6 22 was a good capture MAb buta relatively poor tag. Assays based on DD 1C3 108 as a tag bound D dimerand fibrin breakdown products equally, whereas assays usingDD 3B6 22 as a capture MAb bound D dimer approximately 100fold better. Similarly a signal can be generated with highconcentrations of fibrinogen with the DD 3B6 22 assay butnot DD 1C3 108. Each of these monoclonals shows a similardegree of cross reaction with both these antigens in thestandard enzyme immunoassay Table 1 . Both of these assays can detect low levels of D dimeror other crosslinked derivatives present in serum frompatients with DIC but is is not surprising that the highlevels of fibrinogen present in plasma approx, 3000 µg ml would prevent assays based on MAb DD 1C3 108 as a taggingantibody from giving positive results with plasma. Thecapture antibody in this case DD 4D2 182 has a strongreaction with both fibrinogen and D dimer and the relativelyhigh concentration of fibrinogen in plasma might be expectedto swamp the capture monoclonal on the solid phase. On theother hand the plasma assay based on the monospecific DD 3B6 22will selectively capture crosslinked derivatives even inthe presence of several orders of magnitude higher concentrationsof fibrinogen Fig 2 and is therefore more efficientin relation to assay of crosslinked fibrin derivatives. The latex bead assay results as shown in Fig 4correlated with the other experimental results obtained byEIA referred to previously. The latex bead assay thereforeoffers rapid diagnostic test potential. The abovementioned assay procedures may be carriedout between 4 40 C but more suitably at room temperature.The contact between the test sample and the relevant MAb maybe carried out at a pH of 5 9 with a suitable upper limit ofionic strength being IM.
