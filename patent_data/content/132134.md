# Digital image processing.

## Abstract
A system and a method for processing digital representations of images to produce dilations and erosions at unparalleled speeds and efficiencies includes digital circuitry for effecting a dilation by repetitively delaying the serialized digital image and ORing the delayed digital image back into the serial signal stream. The circuitry thus includes a plurality of stages 128a 128f each comprising a delay 130a 130f and an OR gate 132a 132f in which the input signal to the stage and the delayed signal are ORed.
