# Numerical control method and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
First and second tool control blocks precede and follow a corner on a tool path, respectively, and perpendicularly intersect each other at the corner. A pulse distribution com putation based on NC command data in the second block is not executed at the instant that a pulse distribution compu tation based on NC command data in the first block ends. Rather, a pulse distribution computation based on the NC command data in the second block is performed starting at the instant that a feed speed based on the NC command data in the first block attains a prescribed speed by being decelerated. As a result, the torch of a gas cutting machine or the like will cut the corner portion quickly to a high de gree of accuracy, without cutting the corner to an overly rounded shape.
