# A valve mechanism for an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A valve mechanism for use in an internal combustion engine or the like having a cylinder head 10 , the mechanism comprising a poppet valve 12 supported for movement between valve open and valve closed positions, a coiled valve return spring 18 loosely encircling the stem 14 of the valve and operatively associated at one end with the valve and having its bottom end operatively in abutment with the cylinder head whereby to normally bias the poppet valve to the closed position, and a spring damper 30 having at least its corresponding bottom end of reduced external diameter for a predetermined axial extent whereby to eliminate damper to spring contact for up to at least one and one half coils of the valve spring at its bottom end.
