# Automatic tool changer for rotary tool head with cross feed tool slide.

## Abstract
An automatic tool changer for a machine tool having a rotary toolhead 10 with cross feed slide 22 includes a tilt unit 50 having a tool socket 52 which is pivotal between a first position, parallel to the axis of a machine tool storage magazine 30 to permit loading or unloading of a machine tool carrier into the tool socket 52 from the tool storage magazine 30 by a transfer arm, and a second position paral lel to the axis of the rotary toolhead. A tool changer arm 42 having tool grippers at opposite ends, moves along and rotates about an axis parallel to the rotary toolhead 10 to exchange the tool carrier in the tool socket 52 of the tilt unit 50 with the tool carrier in the rotary toolhead 10 , thereby permitting a new machining operation to be performed by the machine tool as well as storage of the machine tool carrier previously held in the rotary toolhead 10 .
