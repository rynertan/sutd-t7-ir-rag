# Dual master shift register bit stage.

## Abstract
A shift register bit 10 with first and second masters 11, 12 and a slave 13 receives clocked data on the first master 11 from two inputs. After data has been received by the first master 11 , data is coupled from the first master 11 to the second master 12 . In the event that both clocked inputs are operative, the second master 12 is coupled to the slave 13 . One of the inputs is given priority. The other input is disabled. At a predetermined time the second master 12 is decoupled from the slave 13 and the first master 11 is coupled back to the slave 13 .
