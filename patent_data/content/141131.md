# Display system and method for a monitoring and alarm system.

## Abstract
A display system is provided for a monitoring and alarm system. The monitoring and alarm system includes a central processing unit and a plurality of sensors polled by the central processing unit. A display which is part of the central proces sing unit is used to prompt user inputs to group a plurality of the sensed variables and the states and limits of each of the variables in a group. The display system is employed by the user to generate a schematic display of the system or envi ronment being monitored. In the process of generating the schematic display, the user links alarm areas on the schematic display with user defined messages to be displayed in the event all the conditions defined by the states and limits of variables in a group are true. After each schematic has been generated, it is stored together with the data defining the linked areas of the display. A stored schematic display may then be invoked, and once invoked, messages and status conditions are displayed in response to the sensed conditions of groups of variables sensed by said monitoring and alarm system.
