## Description
TITLE STAMP MOUNTSThis invention relates to a mount for the die of a stamp. The die may be a rubber or polymer die for use with an inking pad, or it may be a pre inked rubber die.Such mounts generally consist of a handle fixed to a base. When used with an inking pad, the rubber or polymer dies are often bonded to the underside of the base using double sided adhesive tape. In some applications a sponge layer is interposed between the underside of the base and the die.Since the die is necessarily located beneath the base, some mounts include a visible monitor index along a top or side surface of the base. This index reproduces the text carried by the die and it may, for example, consist of printed paper interposed between a transparent cover and the base.In one known four part mount, the base, transparent cover, and handle are formed of thermoplastic materials which are permanently assembled and bonded to one another using appropriate solvents. The index paper is located in an open ended slot formed between the cover and the base. Such mounts are expensive to manufacture, cannot be easily packaged, and have no means of positively retaining the index paper or preventing dust or other foreign matter entering the slot for the index paper. In another form of mount, the base consists of a wooden block with a central hole for receiving a pushfit wooden handle. The top surface of the block includes a pair of spaced apart oppositely and inwardly inclined grooves extending the length of the block, the grooves each receiving a respective inturned flange of a transparent plastic cover sheet so that, with the handle removed, the sheet can be slidably inserted or removed from the base. An index paper is initially positioned on the top surface of the block between the grooves before sliding the cover sheet into position and then inserting the handle to hold the assembly together. Such mounts generally have an unfinished appearance. Moreover the index paper is again located in an open ended slot formed between the cover sheet and the top surface of the base.Being wood, the joint between the handle and base loosens with time and may therefore require glueing or a new mount.In accordance with the present invention there is provided a stamp mount consisting of a base for supporting a die, a handle connected to the base, and a transparent cover for an index member reproducing the text of the die, characterised in that the cover is seated in a recessed portion of the base, and the top surface of the cover lies below or substantially flush with the said portion of the base.The cover is preferably a snap fit in the recessed portion of the base, and the base is preferably a box like structure with upstanding side walls. The box like base may have an open or closed top. In the case of an open top, the cover is preferably seated in a rebate at the top of each side wall so that the cover lies substantially flush with the top edges of the side walls. The floor of the base may then include a central upstanding post for locating and receiving the handle with a push fit, the handle projecting through a central aperture in the cover.In the case of a closed top, the top surface of the base is preferably recessed beneath the top edges of the side walls and the cover is seated in the recess such that it again lies substantially flush with the top edges of the side walls.A mount embodying the invention is easily assembled without the use of fastners, adhesives, machines or appliances of any kind. The base and handle can be manufactured in self coloured plastics by an injection moulding process to provide a base which has a finished appearance on all four sides with no unsightly seams, joints or apertures.The upper part of the handle preferably has an invert taper to ensure that this part of the handle is free of any mould parting line flash.The seating of the transparent cover in a recessed portion of the base ensures that the index member is positively retained in place beneath the cover and is protected from dust and other foreign matter.By way of example only, a stamp mount embodying the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a sectional view through the base and handle of the mount,Fig. 2 is a plan view of Fig. 1,Fig. 3 is a plan view of a transparent index cover plate, and,Fig. 4 is a section through the base of a mount for a pre inked rubber stamp embodying the invention.Referring to Figs. 1 to 3, the mount consists of an open top box like base 10 having upstanding side walls 11 and a central upstanding hollow post 14 for receiving.a handle 15 with a push fit. A rubber or polymer die not shown is bonded to the underside of the base 10 using double sided adhesive tape.The side walls 11 of the base each include a rebate 12 for seating an index paper and a transparent cover plate. The cover plate 16 is shown in Fig. 3 and is a snap fit in the rebates 12.The mount is assembled as follows. An index paper tnot shown which reproduces the text of the stamp die is initially seated in the rebates 12, the paper being of substantially the same size as the cover plate 16. The cover plate is then snap fitted into position over the index paper, the top surface of the cover plate lying substantially flush with the top edges 22 of the side walls 11, and the hollow post 14 protruding through a central hole 21 in the plate.The stem 23 of the handle 15 is then inserted into the hollow post 14 with a push fit. The hollow handle 15 and base 10 are both of plastics materials, the handle being formed by an injection moulding process. The top of the handle is closed by a disc 17, the disc forming an interference fit and including a logo recess 18. The upper part of the handle 15 is provided with an invert taper to ensure that the top of the handle is free of any mould parting line flash.The small indent 20 in the plate 16 enables removal of the plate for replacement of the index paper.For individual stamp despatches, the mount can be despatched assembled except for the handle to the base. For shipment of large quantities, the mounts can be despatched as a kit of parts to achieve high packing densities.The size and shape of the base can be varied to suit particular applications, and a range of sizes may be used with the same handle.In one alternative embodiment shown in Fig. 4 , a stamp mount for an adjustable pre inked die includes a two part base consisting of an inner die holder 30 which nests within an outer case 31 and has a handle shaft 32 which is a sliding fit in a hollow central post 33 upstanding from the outer case 31. The outer case is a box like structure with upstanding side walls 34, the top surface 35 of the case being recessed beneath the top edges 36 of the side walls. An index paper and transparent cover plate are seated in the recessed portion of the case as described above for the mount of Figs. 1 to 3. In another alternative embodiment not illustrated , the handle and base of a mount for a rubber or polymer die are moulded as an integral unit, the base having a top surface which is recessed beneath the top edges of upstanding side walls so that an index paper and transparent cover plate can be seated in the recess with the top surface of the plate lying substantially flush with the top edges of the side walls.
