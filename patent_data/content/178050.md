## Description
PROTEINACEOUS SUBSTANCE The present invention relates to a proteinaceous substance having cytotoxic and tissue necrotizing properties, to the isolation and purification of such a proteinaceous substance and to the use of such a proteinaceous substance in the treatment of tumors. There have been numerous reports on the existence of substances present in the supernatants of monocytes, macrophages and macrophagelike cell lines which substances have been shown to possess cytotoxic activity. Rat peritoneal cells activated by the administration of endotoxin were sown to release a substance cytotoxic to cells in culture, which. substance was identified as arginase Currie, G.A., Nature 273 158 759, 1978 . Other apparently unrelated cytotoxic substances found in supernatants include neutral proteases Adams,D.O., et al., J. Immunol. 124 293, 1980 and peroxides Nathan.C.F., et al.. J. Exp. Med. 149 100, 1979 . However, no in vivo antitumor activity nas been established for these substances. It was discovered that the serum of mice infected with bacillus Calmette Guerin BCG and subsequently treated with endotoxin possesses tumor necrotizing and cytotoxic activities Carswell,E.A., et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., USA 72 3 3 70, 1975 .This serum is called tumor necrosis serum. These activities were attributed to a tumor necrosis factor TNF by the authors. The partial purification and preliminary characterization of TNF from mouse serum was carried out by S. Green, et al., Proc. Nat. Acad.Sci., USA 73 381 385, 1976, by which it was shown that TNF is a glycoprote in containing sialic acid and galactosamine. This glycoprotein has a molecular weight MW of approximately 150,000 and has the electrophoretic mobility of O globulin in cellulose acetate electrophoresis. Kull, F.C., Jr. and Cuatrecasas,P. J. Immunol.126 1279 1283,1981 fractionated tumor necrosis serum by gel filtration. They found that the serum contained multiple forms, e.g., a high MW fraction having MW of 225,000 to 100,000 and a low MW fraction having MW of 50,000. They discovered that a fraction with MW of 160,000 induced tumor necrosis of an intradermal tumor implant in mice, whereas the 225,000 and 50,000 molecular weight fractions induced no tumor necrosis. We have now isolated a proteinaceous substance from supernatants of stimulated murine macrophage like cells which proteinaceous substance has potent cytotoxic and in vivo tumor necrotizing activities.While this proteinaceous substance has gross structural features and bioactivities similar toEMI2.1 unique t structure may provide distinct therapeutic advantages over other cytotoxic and tumor necrotizing molecules. The present invention provides a proteinaceous substance comprising a self aggregate of a protein subunit capable of non sulfhydryl linked selfaggregation, which protein subunit has a molecular weight of about 15,000 daltons and an isoelectric point of 4.6 0.3. The proteinaceous substance may, in addition to the self aggregates or multimers of the protein subunit, contain other substances such as binding proteins and or prosthetic groups. A proteinaceous substance according to the invention having potent cytotoxic and in vivo tumor necrotizing activities can be isolated from the serum free, cell free supernatants of J774.1 cells a murine macrophage like cell line publicly available from the American Type Culture Collection ATCC , Rockville, MD stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. A crude supernatant may be prepared by the following route.The J77.1 cells may be cultured in vitro. Alternatively, theJ774.1 cells may be injected intraperitoneally into a host mouse and, after a suitable period of time, the ascites cells harvested from the mouse. The cells produced either in vitro or in vivo are then worked free of extraneous protein, suspended in a medium devoid of extraneous protein, and treated with a lipopolysaccharide, for example lipopolysaccharide from S. typhimurium, and incubated.The crude supernatant is then harvested. The crude supernatant may be subjected to purification techniques, for instance to a combination of ion exchange and non denaturing electrophoretic procedures, to give the proteinaceous material in an at least a partially purified form. In a preferred embodiment, the crude supernatant is concentrated by ultrafiltration and then contacted with an anionic exchange resin. The adsorbed proteinaceous substance is then eluted from the ion exchange resin and subjected to non denaturing preparative electrophoresis. The recovered partially purified substance is further applied to an anionic exchange resin. The substance obtained from this purification procedure, which will hereinafter be referred to as holotoxin , which typically has a purity of 20 , migrates upon gel filtration in a symmetrical peak as a globular protein with apparent molecular weights of about 70,000 and 55,000 daltons and migrates in a 7.5 non denaturing polyacrylamide gel with a Rf of 0.7, which is anodal to the majority of supernatant proteins. In addition, the holotoxin on being subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis migrates with an apparent molecular weight of 15,000 daltons. Elution of this product yields a protein having a molecular weight of 15,000 daltons and a pI of 4.6 0.3.The apparent size of this protein subunit increases to 17,000 daltons upon complete reduction with disulfide reducing agents, which suggests the presence of one or more intramolecular disulfide bond s . Accordingly, there is further provided a method of obtaining a cytotoxic material in a substantially pure form, e.g. 95 , which method comprises subjecting the proteinaceous substance of the invention in an at least partially purified form holotoxin to SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, recovering the material which migrates in a 15,000 molecular weight band in the gel, and then causing the recovered 15,000 molecular weight material to form one or more selfaggregates. Aggregation can be encouraged by concentrating the solution of the purified 15,000 MW material. By this method, it is possible to obtain a product having a specific activity enriched 8000 fold to a final value of 32,000 units g as measured on L M cells. The material is cytotoxic to other cultured tumorigenic and normal cells in the range of 1 1000 picomolar. On gel filtration of this self aggregating 15,000 MW material, the activity peaked sharply and symmetrically in two positions corresponding to molecular weights of 70,000 and 55,000 daltons. In addition, we have detected very small amounts of a protein migrating as a 45,000 dalton species by using an 125I radiolabelling technique. Thus, the active forms appear to be dimers, tetramers, and, possibly, trimers of the monomeric form. The aggregates are not sulphydryl linked. The 15,000 MW material was homogenous since it could not be resolved further by twodimensional electrophoresis. This 15,000 molecular weight protein accordingly forms a further aspect of the invention. Aggregation of the material appeared to be necessary for cytotoxic activity since the subunit itself was not cytotoxic.Self aggregates of the 15,000 dalton subunit possessed potent in vivo tumor necrotizing activity.Two picomoles of the aggregate injected intravenously into intradermal fibrasarcoma bearing mice induced rapid hemorrhagic necrosis within the tumor. We do not know if the non aggreated 15,000 MW protein possesses necrotizing activity, since this material may undergo aggregation after being introduced into the living system. Tumor necrosis serum see J. Immunol. 26 1279 1283, 1981 and the supernatants from a murine macrophage like cell line designated RAW 264.7 publicly available from ATCC stimulated with lipopolysaccharide Interleukins, Lymphokines and Cytokines, Academic Press, 1983, pp 511 520 appear to contain a number of cytotoxins by electrophoretic and or gel filtration procedures. We have compared these with the holotoxin isolated from J774. super natants. We prepared rat antiserum to the 70,000 dalton holotoxin isolated from J774.1 supernatants in the following way. FemaleBrown Norway rats were injected intramuscularly in both hind calves with 0.26 ml site of 20 ug holotoxin emulsified in 50 v v Freund s complete adjuvant. They were subsequently injected subcutaneously subscapularly at monthly intervals with 10 20 Vg holotoxin emuBe sified in Freund s incomplete adjuvant. Antisera were obtained from the rats 10 days after the third immunization. The antiserum immunoprecipitated the cytotoxic activity of the holotoxin in a concentration dependent manner. The antiserum also immunoprecipitated activity from the tumor necrosis serum and from the supernatants of stimulated RAW 264.7 cells in an identical manner.Antisera raised in rabbits to the highly purified toxin had the following additional characteristics one pl completely immunoprecipitated 1000 units of the cytotoxic activity from the murine macrophage like cell lines, and it completely neutralised 4000 cytotoxic units in the bioassay. The antisera passively negated the in vivo necrotizing activity of the tumor necrosis serum although preimmune sera had no effect. Thus, the cytotoxic substances tested were all related immunochemically. When the cytotoxic substances from the tumor necrosis serum and from the supernatants of stimulated RAW 264.7 cells were each subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, all the recoverable activity was detected in the 15,000 molecular weight region.In summary, all the cytotoxic substances tested contained the protein subunit having a molecular weight of 15,000 daltons and pI of 4.6 0.3. The proteinaceous substance of the present invention has some properties similar to those reported for lymphotoxin, a glycosylated protein derived from lymphoid cells. Granger, G.A., et al, Biology of the Lymphokines,1979, Academic Press, Inc, pp 141 163, described the size heterogeneity of human lymphotoxins and classified numerous subtypes into two broad groups those whose polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic migration was similar to 8 globulin, and those whose migration was similar to albumin.Aggarwal, B.B., et al J. Biol.Chem.259 686 691, 1984 report that human lymphotoxin appears to be composed of aggregates of smaller units. It migrates upon gel filtration with an apparent MW of 67,000 and upon SDS gel electrophoresis with an apparent MW of 20,000. We have tested the proteinaceous substance of the present invention with anti lymphotoxin antiserum. The antiserum did not, however, neutralize or immunoprecipitate the proteinaceous substance thus proving that the latter substance and lymphotoxin are not related immunochemically. Furthermore, the amino acid composition of the proteinaceous substance we describe is dramatically different from the composition described for lymphotoxin Aggarwal, op. cit. .Thus, the two substances share some structural oligomeric size and functional cytotoxic charcteristics, but their composition is distinct. Their unique activities are likely to reflect these distinctions. For example the two materials are alleged to possess different spectra of toxicity on cell lines Williamson, B.D., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80 5397 51401, 1983 . There is yet further provided a method of treating a tumorbearing host to bring about tumor necrosis which method comprises administering to the host a tumor necrotizing dosage of the proteinaceous substance of the invention. Also provided is a composition for use in such a method of treatment which composition comprises the proteinaceous substance of the invention together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. EXAMPLE J774.1 cells were grown up in culture. 3 x 106 washed cells were injected intraperitoneally per BALB c mouse. Ascites cells were harvested three weeks later. Mice yielded 1 2 x 108 tumor cells mouse. The cells were washed first in RPMI 1640, then in cold 0.87 NH4Cl, and again in RPMI 1640. They were suspended at a concentration of 1.2 x 109 L in RPMI 1640 which contained 50 pg ml garamycin and 1 ug ml of lipopolysaccharide obtained from S. typhimurium LT 2. The suspension was incubated at 370C for 7 hr after which the supernatant was harvested. Supernatants contained 20 40 mg protein and 2 x 105 cytotoxic units per liter.Lots of 1 2 L of the supernatants were made up to 0.01 sodium azide and 50 uM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. The supernatant was centrifuged at 1500 g to remove particulate material and 500 ml of supernatant were then concentrated 100 to 200 fold by ultrafiltration versus a PM 30 membrane a 30,000 MW pore size membrane from Amicon . The concentrate was dialyzed versus equilibrating buffer 50 mM Tris HCl. pH 8.0, 15 mM NaCl and applied to a MonoQ anion exchange column a hydrophilic polymer containing quaternary gamine groups, obtained from Pharmacia . 1 ml fractionsiminute were collected. Activity was eluted with a linear 15 500 mM NaCl gradient. The active fractions were pooled and reapplied to the column. Elution was then carried out with a 100 300 mM NaCl gradient. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated toel ml by ultrafiltration versus a PM 10 membrane a 10,000 MW pore size membrane from Amicon . Tn concentrate was diluted 10 fold with H20, reconcentrated and applied to preparative electrophoresis in a 1100 PG device Bethesda Research Laboratories employing a 1 x 5 cylindrical 7.5 polyacrylamide gel gel system of Laemmli, U.K.,Nature 227 680 685, 1970, but devoid of SDS and a stacking gel .The electrophoresis was performed in the cold with a constant current of 5 mamps. The elution rate was 1.1 ml fraction 9 min. Active fractions were pooled, diluted with equilibrating buffer, concentrated by ultrafiltration and applied to a Mono Q anion exchange column.Activity was eluted with a linear 15 500 mM NaCl gradient and the active fractions were collected and pooled. The apparent size of the holotoxin was determined by gel filtration as described below.900 Units 150 ng of the holotoxin obtained l0 ul was mixed wltn 5 ul of a sizing standards preparation Biorad . The mixture was applied to a HPLC system Waters Associates, Morristown, New Jersey , fitted with a TSK 250 gel filtration column Biorad run in 15Q nt NaCl, 20 mM NaPi sodium phosphate , pH 7.4. The flow rate was 1 ml min, and 0.2 ml fractions were collected and assessed for toxicity. The results are shown in Fig. 1. In fact, the A280 cf the holotoxin was too low for detection. The four major peaks InFigure 1 solid line show the standards t .yrogloDulin molecular weight 669,000 daltons ovalbumin molecular weight 45,000 daltons myoglobulin molecular weight 18,000 daltons and phenylalanine molecular weight 165 .Ovalbumin and myoglobin gave a linear log molecular weight versus elution volume relationship from which the molecular weight of the holotoxin was determined to be about 70,000 daltons. The holotoxin was subjected to further purification as follows.The pooled fractions obtained from the previous anionic exchange resin treatment were subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the system of Laemmli, U.K., Nature 227 680 685, 1970, but devoid of a stacking gel and using an SE 600 slab gel apparatus Hoeffer Scientific Instruments . For example, holotoxin 180 ng 1000 units was applied to a lane in a 140 x 0.75 mm slab gel containing 0.1 SDS, 15 polyacrylamide and 0.25 crosslinker.The results of the SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis are illustrated in Figure 2. The left lane is holotoxin and the right line contains a number of molecular weight protein standards obtained from Bethesda Research Laboratories, Bethesda, Maryland . Tne standards are from top to bottom major bands phosphorylaseB, MW 92,500 bovine serum albumin, MW 66,200 ovalbumin, MW 45,000 carbonic anhydrase, MW 31,000 soybean trypsin inhibitor, MW 21,500 lysozyme, MW 14,400. An identical holotoxin lane was sliced 2.23 mm slice . The size were eluted overnight by soaking in 200 ul 150 trM NaCl, 20 mE NaPi, pH 7.4 and 0.1 bovine serum albumin to collect the purified subunit protein. The grapr inFigure 2, which shows the corresponding position of the gel slices and the units eluted note the logarithmic scale , illustra es that the holotoxin migrates, on SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with an apparent MW of 15,000.A small amount migrates with an apparent MW of 45,000. Larger quantities of the 15,000 dalton protein were collected similarly, except that the holotoxin was layered preparatively across the entire gel slab, and the region containing the 15,000 dalton protein was eluted electrophoretically according to the method described by Hunkapillar, MW., et al., Met. Enzymol. 91 227 236, 1983, except without SDS and without a presoak in dithiothreitol. In this manner, fg quantities of the purified toxin were obtained. The toxin constituted better than 95 percent of the total protein in the electrophoretic eluant as assessed by photometric scanning of silver stained SDSpolyacrylamide gels. Gel filtration was performed on the purified toxin in a manner identical to that performed on the holotoxin as described above, and dilutions were measured for cytotoxic activity. The activity was found to peak sharply and symmetrically in a position corresponding to MW of 70,000. A second lot eluted with a MW of 55,000. The stepwise purification is given in Table 1 below.

Biotech.8 97 103, 1983 . The cell lines tested were the following theL M line ATCC CCL 1.2 , a murine tumorigenic fibroblast the CPAE line ATCC CCL 209 , bovine aortic endothelial cells MCF7 ATCCHTB 22 , a human mammary carcinoma line and Hep G2 ATCC HB 8065 , a human liver carcinoma line. The cell lines were seeded in their usual growth media in microtiter trays, roughly 5000 7500 cells well 200 jil medium, and incubated overnight. Log3 dilutions of holotoxin were added the following day. The cell lines were left to incubate until toxicity was evident by light microscopic examination. The trays were then scored with neutral red according to Kull, F.C.. Jr. andP. Cuatrecasas, Applied Biochem. Biotech. 8 97 103, 1983.Cell lines differ in their capacity to internalize neutral red control A542 however, the curve for each cell line, shown inFigure 3 gives a relative indication of the number of living cells. All of the cell lines tested were sensitive the L M cell line was the most sensitive. Dose response of toxin on in vivo tumor necrosis Intradermal implants were prepared using a methyl cholanthreneinduced transplantable fibrosarcoma in BALB c mice. One week later, when the tumor diameter was approximately 5 mm, Ihice received a single 0.5 ml intravenous injection i.v. of test holotoxin which had been dialyzed or diluted in pyrogen free saline. Control animals received 0.5 ml filtrate dialysis solution . Animals were scored for tumor necrosis after 24 hr, where the scale range from no apparent necrosis 0 to necrosis covering the entire diameter of the tumor 4 . Number MiceCytotoxic Units Necrosis Score 0 1 2 3 4 3 0 6 1,000 3 2 2,000 2 2 1 4,000 1 2 2 8,000 1 1 3 From the results tabulated above, it is clear that the holoxotin contains the capacity to induce necrosis of an intradermal implant.The tumor necrotizing capacity was dose dependent. Additional trials have confirmed that 4000 8000 units reproducibly induced substantial tumor necrosis in test mice. Necrosis was visibly apparent redness of the tumor within 2 hr of injection.We found that the effective but sub lethal necrotizing dose range was 4000 12000 units. The preparation was examined for the presence of endotoxin since this substance also possesses this activity and because LPS was a component of the crude starting material. Although liy00 units 500 ng protein of toxin gave substantial necrosis as can be seen aDove, it contained 1000 times less endotoxin as determined by the Limulus anebocyte lysate assay than that amount of LPS alone necessary to produce necrosis. The purified toxin contained necrotizing activity. Holotoxin was fractionated by SDS preparative electrophoresis. The major bands were excised and isolated by electrophoretic elution as described in the example. The material obtained fro the 15,000 MW band was diluted 20 fold in pyrogen free saline to 4000 units 125 ng 0.5 ml . The materials obtained from the other banfls were similarly diluted. All were tested for necrotizing activity. Necrosis was observed only in the group of mice which received the material obtained from the 15,000 MW band. Aggregation of subunits is necessary for cytotoxic activity on L M cells. Assuming a molecular weight of 70,000 for the purified toxin i.e., the reaggregated material . the concentration of toxin which produced one cytotoxic unit on L M cells was 2 x 10 12 M. The dose of the purified toxin required to induce necrosis of an intradermal tumor was 125 ng 2 nmole given i.v.A single dose of 500 ng i.v. was lethal to tumor bearing mice.
