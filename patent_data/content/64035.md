## Description
LUMINOUS SIGN FOR TRUCKSThe model of utility referred to in this description and which we call luminacab consists of a metallic frame made of sheet which can be either zinc and p stic coated or painted with epoxidic powder, which is used to hold up a shaped panel of transparent perspex, in order to bring out a luminescent advertising notice.The frame is mounted with special supports on the truck s cab.The perspex panel and the frame are screwed on a suede port of plastic or fibre glass, which is fitted on the coachwork sheet of the cab s roof either by screws or by a metallic L shaped attachment at the rain l gutter of the cab itself.The panel with the advertising notice is of lumine l scent type in order to make clear the pictures and the signs from a relatively good distance, since inside the fibre glass support there is a light source constituted by a number of luminescent electric light bulbs.The luminacab system is produced in different models, and can be mounted on most current truck models which can be found in Italy and abroad.the luminacab system is well illuminated and therefore is very effective in the dark, emphaXizing the the notices reproduced on the perspex surface.The picture 1 of the table 1 shows the ensemble luminacab which consists of luminous panel a , the frame b and the support of fibre glass c . The pio ture of the table 1 shows the luminacab section with the fibre glass support on whose inside may be seen the set of lumineseent electric light bulbs. The picture 3 of the table 1 points out the transversal section of the perspex panel a with the metallic frame b . IThe luminescent electric light bulbs d which work by the available voltage of the motor vehicle are mounted on suitable bulb sockets with connection either Edison system or of bayonet cap. Each bulb socket is fixed at the base by a steel rivet on an aluminium hoop g screwed on the fibre glass box c .The aluminium hoop brings the negative pole of the electric current while a second conductor of protected copper h brings the positive polarity. The electric connection with the truck is assured by a bipolar relay.The metallic frame b is made of a pressed steel sheet, either zinc and plastic coated or painted with epoxidic powder, it consists of two semicircles and two straight axles welded together.The luminacab can reproduced with white supports or, on request,in any colour. i The luminacab is very suitable for the advertising of commercial and industrial p roducts, and for slogans for any kind of firm. It offers an advertising at low price which is brought into the cities of different countries by the trucks, spreading the message by day and by night. In order to point out more the original innovations which we introduced for the luminous truck s signs, we say that in similar products on the market nowadays 1 the lighting installation is constituted of bulb sockets fixed directly on the fibre glass and supplied by two wires which link them 2 the perspex is fixed on the fibre glass side by al circular section rubber washer which has three grooves the lower one to hold the perspex, the upper one which must be fitted in the fibre glass, and the central one where runs a string for the expansion locking. Consl dering the extent and the flexibility of this kind of plate, the assembling is extremely difficult and be sides it requires the work of two persons and also the dismounting of the truck s sign.
