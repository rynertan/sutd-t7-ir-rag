## Abstract
This invention relates to a method forming fluorine doped glass. A coating of glass particles is deposited on the surface of a cylindrical rod of high purity glass. The coated rod is inserted into a furnace which contains a cylindrical muffle formed of high silica content glass. A fluorine containing atmosphere is flowed through the muffle and over the outer surface of the coating of glass particles and also flows inwardly through the interstices thereof. The temperature within the furnace is sufficiently high to cause fluorine to diffuse into the surfaces of the glass particles and to cause the particles to fuse and form a fluorine containing dense glass coating on the surface the rod.
