# Photographic element employing a substituted sulfonamidophenol or sulfonamidonaphthol dye releasing compound.

## Abstract
A photographic diffusion transfer element is described which employs a nondiffusible, redox, dye releasing com pound comprising a ballasted, sulfonamidophenol or sulfo namidonaphthol compound having a dye moiety attached thereto through the sulfonamido group of the compound, the sulfonamido group being located in a position which is conjugated with respect to the position of the hydroxy group of the compound, and wherein a the compound has at least one substituent in a position which is conjugated with respect to the position of the sulfonamido group, the substituent being a hydroxy, sulfonamido, phosphonamido or carbonamido group, and b the compound not having a hydroxy, alkoxy, aryloxy, sulfonamido, phosphonamido or carbonamido group in a position which is conjugated with respect to the position of the hydroxy group of the compound, with the proviso that when the compound is a 2 sulfonamidophenol at least one of said substituents is located in the 5 position or in both the 3 and 5 positions. The dye releasing compound releases the dye moiety at a faster rate than similar dye releasing compounds of the prior art.
