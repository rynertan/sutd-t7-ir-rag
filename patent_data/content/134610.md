# Domestic electrical appliance.

## Abstract
In a domestic appliance, such as a washing machine, controlled by a solid state processor 1, it is possible for power supply interference to corrupt the programme data stored in the processor or even to lock out the processor. The adverse effects thereof are eliminated by providing a non volatile back up store 11, for storing the programme identity and state, and timing means 14, 16, 18 which, in the event of power failure or processor lock out, momentarily discon nects the power supply 2 to the processor 1 by a switch 3.
