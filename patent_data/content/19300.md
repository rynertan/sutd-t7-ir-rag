# Heating and or cooling system.

## Abstract
In a heating and or cooling system, two heat transmitting media are blended into a blended medium with adjustable temperature. The motor M of a blending member is controlled pulsewise in both directions by comparison pulses from a setpoint actual value temperature comparison. In order to provide a system which is simple to construct, which is wear resistant and which permits a quick and accurate adjustment of the blending member, the circuit arrangement for controlling the motor M contains a first pulse generator TB1 , which generates pulses of constant width commencing respectively with the end of a comparison pulse and is connected to second and third pulse generators TB2, TB3 . The second and third pulse generators TB2, TB3 generate pulses of a width proportional to the actual value or the setpoint of the temperature, respectively, which directly control the motor M after comparison in a comparator CO . The blending member is advantageously the blend door for air supply into a motor vehicle or a mixing valve for liquid media.
