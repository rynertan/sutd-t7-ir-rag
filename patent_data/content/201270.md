# PHOTOELECTRIC CONVERTING DEVICE

## Abstract
A photoelectric converting device comprises a plurality of photoelectric converting cells. The cells have a semiconductor transistor consisting of two main electrode regions formed of a semiconductor of one conductivity type and a control elec trode region formed of a semiconductor of the opposite con ductivity type, and a capacitor for controlling a potential of the control electrode region in the floating state. Each of the photoelectric converting cells performs at least the operations to accumulate carriers generated due to an inci dent light into the control electrode region and read out an ac cumulated voltage generated due to the accumulated carriers by controlling the potential of the control electrode region in the floating state through the capacitor. An isolating region for electrically isolating the adjacent photoelectric converting cells is formed of a semiconductor of the same conductivity type as that of said main electrode re gions of the photoelectric converting cell.
