## Description
This invention relates to adaptive information processing systems. More particularly it relates to self organizing input output devices which function to separate and identify classes of patterns that are not necessarily linearly separable. The below referenced patents to Cooper et al. disclose methods and apparatus systems that can separate and classify patterns or real world events that are not linearly separable. The patterns or events in the outside world can be detected and described by a set of measurements, the results of which are represented by an input signal S comprised of individual signals s₁, s₂...s In a system comprising a Nestor adaptive module as described in these patents, all input signals S which are themselves referred to herein as patterns belonging to the same class should elicit the same final response from the system. For example, in the context of an application such as character recognition, any version of a handdrawn 2 seen by the system should result in an output signal which causes the character font member for 2 to be displayed on some output device, such as a video screen, printout, etc. A system of this type, or so called Nestor System , is an extremely powerful pattern class separator and identifier. For example, this system may be trained with a learning procedure in which the operator need have no knowledge of the complex geography of the multi dimensional space in which the pattern class separation and identification is being performed. Such a system requires the input signal S to be preprocessed into an intermediate signal F which represents only certain prescribed features of the original patterns. The input signal S normally contains too much irrelevant information for effective pattern recognition by the Nestor System. Subjecting the input signal S representing the pattern to this preprocessing step referred to herein as encoding should preserve enough information to permit patterns to be distinguished from each other. Information that is irrelevant for learning one class may be important to distinguish some other. For this reason, it may be difficult to choose a single preprocessing strategy that removes all irrelevant information without jeopardizing the ability to distinguish some classes. The system we describe here can be thought of, in one sense, as a way of linking together a number of such Nestor Systems. Each component Nestor System can be regarded as a complete unit, including its own preprocessing and encoding procedures. A pattern is identified by the responses it produces among these component units. Each unit has its own encoding procedures, different from that of any other. Therefore, it is sensitive to certain types of information in the input signal. The particular set of features it registers may give it a special aptitude for learning some types of pattern classes, but not others. A class will be learned automatically by that unit with the best aptitude fot learning it. At the same time, learning other pattern classes may require pooling the resources of several component units, none of which alone has sufficient discriminating skills, by virtue of its preprocessing and encoding properties, to distinguish these classes. In these cases, the system identifies an example of this class by correlating the responses of a set of units. As an example of this, consider once again the task of identifying hand drawn characters. The pattern properties registered by one unit may give emphasis to certain aspects of the characters but not to others. Specifically, the extracted features may serve well to distinguish among characters with rectilinear shapes, such as A , H , K , N , etc. but may not provide good separation between characters with circular shapes, such as B , C , Q , etc. Consequently, this unit will distinguish rectilinear shapes while a unit that encodes circular features could learn to separate pattern classes in which circular features are present and distinctive. Encoding feature extraction schemes for hand drawn characters, audible sounds and numerous other types of patterns are well known in the art and are described in the literature. An overview of this technology for hand drawn characters is given in Not every unit of a Nestor System learns every class. Further, each unit is only looking at a fraction of all the possible pattern properties registered by the system as a whole. Consequently, learning of a pattern class occurs more quickly and more economically in terms of the size of system memory than if the system consisted of a single unit which combined the preprocessing and coding of all the individual units in the system. Another advantageous and novel feature of this system and its architecture is that it allows the possibility of incorporating new units into the system over the course of training. This is an especially useful property if the kind of pattern classes that the system is expected to deal with changes substantially over time. Additional units may be incorporated in the course of the system s experience without, in general, the need to retrain the system on the pattern classes it has already learned. Advantageously, each Nestor adaptive module can be trained to be exceedingly adept and accurate in its classification of certain types of patterns. This sophistication permits a module to classify based on extremely subtle differences between patterns provided that the unit has the necessary preprocessing and encoding to sense those differences. A high level of ability to classify patterns based on one set of criteria does not preclude the ability to use another set of criteria from another module or set of modules to classify based on a different set. The Nestor adaptive module is, itself, a well known device for pattern classification and identification. This device is described, inter alia, in the aforementioned U. S. Patents Nos. 3,950,733 4,044,243 4,254,474 and 4,326,259, to Cooper et al. A principal object of the present invention is to provide a pattern class separator and identifier which can separate and identify classes of patterns having a wide variety of salient features. Another object of the present invention is to provide a pattern class separator and identifier which can separate and identify classes of patterns which may have only small and subtle differences between them. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a specific software implemented embodiment of the present invention which is capable of achieving the objects stated immediately above. These objects, as well as further objects of the present invention that will become apparent from the discussion that follows, are achieved, according to the invention, by providing a pattern classification and identification system comprised of the features specified in claim 1. The pattern class separator and identifier according to the invention thus takes advantage of the possibility of encoding different sets of features of a particular pattern so that classification of this pattern may be based upon a wide variety of features. Since the pattern classifier is thus able to see various aspects of the pattern, its ability to classify the pattern is substantially increased. Similarly, the provision of a multiplicity of pattern classifiers, looking at a different aspect of the encoding device output and each trained in a slightly different way, makes it possible to separate the pattern into one of a large number of possible classes. It will be appreciated that when a very large number of possible classes are involved, the pattern classifier is able to distinguish between subtle differences in the patterns which it sees .

Udagawa et al., a parallel two stage decision method for character recognition is described. This is a statistical method based on a Bayes decision rule rather than the prototype memory means taught by the present invention. A parallel two stage character recognition method is also disclosed in Wissenschaftl. Berichte, vol. 52, no. 1 2, 2nd January 1979, pages 31 38 J. Schürmann. In this method the final selection among independent parallel responses is made by reference to external criteria in word context and not by any interaction between the mutually exclusive parallel responses.

The present invention and its preferred embodiments will now be described with reference to Figs. 1 and 4 10 of the drawings. A preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in Fig. 1. This embodiment will be described here in general terms sufficient for an understanding of the present invention. Details of this embodiment are described below with reference to Figs. 4 10.

In the training mode only, the system requires a memory modification controller 124 which modifies the weighting factors, multipliers and threshold levels in the manner described in the aforementioned patents. The pattern class separator and identifier illustrated in Fig. 4 may be implemented either in hardware or in software. As mentioned above, the pattern feature encoding devices may be implemented in the manner described by C.Y. Suen et al. in The pattern classification device 116 in each classification unit 112 as well as the class selection device 122 will now be described with reference to Figs. 5 9 of the drawings which illustrate algorithms, according to the preferred embodiment, for implementing these devices in software. In this description certain terms have been given unique and precise meanings which are set forth in the attached Appendix. The result of comparing the pattern with prototypes at various units of the system is a set of prototypes that are firing, distributed over the different units. Prototypes firing within a unit cause the unit to emit a response, and the responses of the various k units interact to produce the ultimate output of the system. Modifications to memory of a Nestor adaptive module occur during training in response to the presentation of a pattern and its class, the latter typically being supplied by the user. The basic operations involved in changing the module memory are 1 the commitment of a P1 prototype, 2 reduction of the threshold of a P1 prototype, 3 transformation of a P1 prototype into a P2 prototype and 4 the commitment of a P2 prototype.
