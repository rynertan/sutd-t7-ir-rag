# SORTING

## Abstract
An apparatus to convey items for sorting into two or more classes for quality, appearance and the like. One or more wands for use by operators to indicate an item to be sorted in a specific way are movable, over a support surface to convey the items, to the proximity of the item to generate a signal. The signal is picked up by a matrix of beneath the surface to produce a signal from which the position of the item indicated can be derived. The signal, which is conve niently of two components are represented lengthwise and the other crosswise position on the support surface, is compared with a falling ramp signal. The signal picked up by the matrix part nearest the wand, and thus the indicated item, is the largest and will be the first to equal the value of the falling ramp and thus identify the position of the item. This position is supported to means to control the discharge of items from the support surface so that indicated items can be selectively discharged as appropriate.
