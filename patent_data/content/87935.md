# FLUID FLOW CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
Pressurised air bled from a turbine engine 14 is fed to an aircraft cabin 18 by way of a duct 12 the rate of flow along which is controlled by a butterfly valve 28 actuated by a pneumatic actuator 36 . The actuator 36 operates in response to a control signal 54 derived at 42 from the inlet to the duct 12 and modified by a control signal 52 obtained by blending high and low air pressure signals 46, 48 derived from larger and smaller venturis 22, 26 and representing air flow. The degree of blending is set at 140 by an operator in dependence on the number of passengers in the cabin so that the amount of air supplied will not be more than is necessary even if there are few passengers.
