# Active display matrix addressable without crossed lines on any one substrate and method of using the same.

## Abstract
A light influencing display 50 is provided which has a plurality of pixels, each pixel 51 including a first electrode 20 and a second electrode 44 . A separate control device 22 is associated with and connected to each pixel 51 . Associated with each pixel 51 is also a voltage supply lead 32 , a control lead 30 and a data lead 44 . A desired voltage can be applied between the electrodes of a given pixel by using a selected control lead 30 to turn on its control device 22 , and by using a selected data lead 44 to supply a data voltage to its second electrode. Addressing of the display pixels is performed with out crossing leads, avoiding the risk of short circuits between such leads. The voltage supply and control leads can also be combined, greatly reducing the number of leads required in such a display.
