# Bone graft substitute.

## Abstract
A bone graft has a dense calcium phosphate ceramic core and porous calcium phosphate ceramic surface layers for directly obtaining viable bone growth surfaces. The graft is implanted as a replacement or extension segment for a natural bone segment or to repair a deformity with its porous end layers in intimate contact with osseous material at prepared ends of the bone. The dense core provides the required flexural and compressive strength whereas the porous surface layers promote bone ingrowth that fuses the bone to the graft.

## Description
BONE GRAFT SUBSTITUTE The present invention relates to bone graft substitutes and more particularly to bone graft substitutes formed of calcium phosphates, such as hydroxylapatite or whitlockite. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION There exists a need for improved grafts to replace portions of natural bones. In certain accidents, bone is so badly crushed or splintered that conventional setting coupled with natural healing processes will not repair the bone to the extent that sufficient strength for normal activity is restored. A crushed jaw bone, for example, will frequently be irrepairable by the normal setting and healing process.In other instances, portions of bone must be surgically removed, e.g., to correct bone deformities or to excise local bone cancers. It has long been recognized that hydroxylapatite, Ca10 PO4 6 OH 2 and whitlockite, Ca3 PO4 2, ceramics have properties which make them particularly suitable for use in bone or dental prostheses. Hydroxylapatite is the major mineral phase of both tooth and bone and therefore fully compatible with bone and other tissue. It is a non resorbable ceramic material which in dense, porous, or particulate form provides continual restorative or corrective performance. Whitlockite, in contrast, is bio resorbable, the rate of dissolution being proportional to its surface area, i.e., porous and particulate forms resorb much faster than dense block sections.Attempts to provide suitable hydroxylapatite and whitlockite bulk bone grafts or dental prostheses, however, have heretofore been less than successful due to the difficulty of forming hydroxylapatite or whitlockite grafts of sufficient strength which will rapidly fuse with the bone during initial healing. A bone graft substitute must have both tensile and compressive strength sufficient to withstand the forces it experiences in the site of the natural bone portion it replaces and should also provide an interface with bone tissue that promotes rapid attachment of bone tissue to achieve integration of the remaining bone and the bone graft. Inserts of hydroxylapatite have previously been produced with sufficient porosity to promote bone ingrowth, but the required porosity has been achieved at the expense of adequate compressive strength for most prosthetic applications. The inadequacy of certain prior attempts to produce suitable hydroxylapatite prostheses are detailed in U.S. PatentNo. 4,097,935. Porous whitlockite suffers from the same low strength characteristics that degrade even further as the material is resorbed. Patent No. 4,097,935 teaches that, opposed to producing prosthetic hydroxylapatite ceramics by sintering powdered hydroxylapatite, as had been attempted previously, prosthetic ceramics may be produced by sintering a gelatinous precipitate of calcium and phosphate. The ceramics are primarily hydroxylapatite but may contain some whitlockite, ss tricalcium phosphate, and other calcium phosphate compounds, depending on the calcium to phosphate ratio.Generally, when the gelatinous precipitate is sintered, a solid, non porous, ceramic is formed. However, if the precipitate contains particulate organic material, such as powdered starch, cellulose, cotton or collagen, in amounts ranging from 5 to 25 weight percent of the calcium plus phosphate, the ceramic will have substantial porosity. Providing that a sufficiently strong calciumphosphate ceramic can be formed by sintering powdered material, the method of sintering powder has an advantage over methods of forming ceramic material from gelatinous calcium phosphate precipitates or other precursors with high water content. The compacted calcium phosphate powders are foamed directly to shape during the pressing step, experiencing shrinkage only as densification occurs during sintering. The gelations materials, however, experience significant shrinkage as the water is removed and a green body is formed, and further shrinkage occurs as densification by sintening takes place. The latter process allows for a greater chance of flaw development due to nonuniform shrinkage or varying cross sectional areas. In U.S. Patent No. 3,855,638, a porous metal surface layer is applied to a solid metal substrate by sintering a slurry of metallic powder and organic binders onto the previously formed substrate. The organic binders burn off during sintering leaving pores in the metallic surface layer. While such a procedure might work with metals, a hydroxylapatite or whitlockite ceramic prosthetic device could not be formed by sintering a mixture of hydroxylapatite or whitlockite powder and organic materials to a solid sintered ceramic substrate, because such a procedure would form a device with a weak interface between the porous ceramic layer and the dense substrate, causing the porous ceramic layer to crack off the dense substrate when subjected to significant stress. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A prosthetic ceramic material is formed having a solid, non porous hydroxylapatite or whitlockite core and integrally formed porous hydroxylapatite or whitlockite surface layers with continuous interfaces between the core and the surface layers that resist interfacial failure. A structure is molded by layering powdered material in a mold, the layers which are to form the porous surface layers comprising a mixture of hydroxylapatite and or whitlockite powder and powdered organic material and the layer which is to form the non porous core comprising substantially pure hydroxylapatite and or whitlockite powder.The layers are tamped down as they are laid, and after the mold is filled, the layered powders are compacted in a molding press to about 55 175MPa pressure and then heated to between 10500C and about 13000C for a period sufficient to sinter the green compacted body into a fused structure. During this heating process, the organic material is volatilized, leaving pores in the surface layers. The core has substantial tensile and compressive strength, whereas the pores of the surface layers provide for bone ingrowth and rapid initial stabilization. After ingrowth has taken place, the bone with such a fully integrated graft is again strong.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT In accordance with the present invention, a bone graft 10 FIG. 2 , formed either entirely or primarily of calcium phosphate ceramic material, such as hydroxylapatite and or whitlockite, has a strong, dense, non porous core 12 and integrally joined porous hydroxylapatite and or whitlockite surface layers 14 that interface with natural bone osseous material and into which bone material grows. The bone graft 10 is formed by sintering a green graft of powdered material that has been deposited as layers in a cavity 15 of a mold or die 20 FIG. 1 and compacted at high pressures.The core 12 is formed from a central layer 16 FIG. 1 of substantially pure hydroxylapatite and or whitlockite powder, whereas the porous surface layers 14 are formed from layers 18 of hydroxylapatite and or whitlockite powder mixed with powdered organic material that is volatilized and disappears during sintering. Calcium phosphate ceramic will be used herein to refer to hydroxylapatite, whitlockite and mixtures thereof. Generally a graft 10 will be formed of hydroxylapatite where permanecy and substantial strength are required, whereas a graft will be formed of whitlockite where it is desired that the graft be resorbed and eventually replaced by bone tissue. In certain applications, whitlockite and hydroxylapatite may be mixed to form a semi resorbable prosthesis.Different portions of the graft 10 may be formed of different calcium phosphate material for example, the dense core 12 may be formed of hydroxylapatite while the porous surface layers 14 are formed of resorbable whitlockite. The green graft is formed in a mold 20, such as that illustrated in FIGURE 1 including a supporting die table 21, having a cavity 15 with a configuration similar to the portion of the bone 22 which the graft is intended to replace. Because shrinkage does occur as the calcium phosphate ceramic powder fuses into an integral unit, the mold is typically somewhat larger than the graft which will be produced. The mold 20 shown in FIGURE 1 is configured for forming the generally flat, arcuate graft that is shown in FIGURE 2 and intended for forming a bone graft that is used to extend the mental process of the mandible genioplasty FIGS. 3a, 3b . This graft 10 has a flat core 12 and two spaced apart, generally parallel end surface layers 14. A graft of non parallel surface layers is also possible by modification of the compaction tooling.In some cases, it may be necessary to machine the sintered graft 10 to its final shape matching the configuration of an excised bone segment alternatively, the material may be made in bulk and simply cut to shape. The mold 20 is installed in a press, typically hydraulic in nature, whose compaction pressure is adjustable by changing the oil pressure to hydraulic cylinders not shown . A lower piston driven punch 25a is moved into the lower end of the cavity 15, and the lower layer 18, the core layer 16 and the upper 18a deposited thereupon. Then an upper piston driven punch 25b is moved downward into the die cavity 15 to apply compacting pressure to the layers. A mechanical, electrical or hand operated press or clamp frame may also be used to compact the green body. It is desirable to use a calcium phosphate ceramic powder in as pure a form as possible in order to maximize the strength and homogeneity of the bone graft. For purposes of the invention, the calcium phosphate powder is preferably at least about 97 weight percent pure and most preferably at least about 99 weight percent pure calcium phosphate in hydroxylapatite and or whitlockite form. Small particle size processed calcium phosphate powders are found to produce the best results as they can be closely packed with minimum interstitial volume, and for purposes of this invention, it is preferred that the calcium phosphate powder be able to sift through a screen having openings less than 175 microns 80 mesh . The amount of powdered organic material represented as solid circles 26 in FIG. 1 which is intermixed with the ceramic hydroxylapatite and or whitlockite powder represented as clear circles 28 depends on the desired porosity of the surface layer 14. Generally the organic material particles 26 comprise between about 10 volume percent and about 60 volume percent of the powder mixture that forms the surface layer, and the ceramic material particles 28 comprise the remaining 40 90 volume percent. Typically the organic material particles comprise about 50 volume percent of this mixture. It is preferred that the particle size of the organic material be chosen such that resultant surface porosity falls generally in the 100 250 micron range, and for purposes of this invention, the particle size of the organic material is generally such that the particles of organic material will sift through a screen having square openings with dimensions between about two and about seven times those of a screen through which the ceramic powder sifts. The choice of the particulate organic material that is mixed with the ceramic powder to form the surface layers is not considered to be particularly critical so long as the organic material is volatilized substantially without trace at or below the sintering temperatures, i.e., at or below 1050 C. Very suitable organic materials for providing the pores are polyvinyl alcohol PVA , polyethyleneglycol PEG , or urea. Other suitable materials include powdered starch, cellulose, cotton or collagen. The shape of the pore forming organic material is chosen to be consistant with that of the final pore geometry desired. With reference to the block diagram of FIG. 4, the organic material particles are blended A in a mixer with hydroxylapatite and or whitlockite particles. The resulting homogeneous mixture is then deposited B as a lower surface layer 18 in the mold cavity 15 to a depth of between about 0.5 and about 8.0 mm, i.e., a depth sufficient to form a fused surface layer with a thickness of between about 0.25 and about 4.0 mm, and tamped down with a flat headed tool not shown sufficiently so that relatively little mixing occurs when the core forming layer of calcium phosphate ceramic powder is deposited thereon. Of course, slight mixing will occur at the interface when the layers are later pressed against each other, but this is considered advantageous because it provides an interfacial region that blends somewhat gradually from porous to non porous.Calcium phosphate ceramic powder is deposited C as a second, deep, homogeneous layer 16 on top of the first mixed layer 18 to a depth a depth of between about 5 and about 80 mm, sufficient to provide a bone graft core of desired thickness, usually about 2.5 to 40 mm., and this layer is similarly tamped down.Next a third upper layer 18, generally equal in composition and thickness to the first layer, is deposited D and tamped down. Then the entire layered powder structure is compacted E , e.g., by activating the hydraulic cylinders to press the die punches 25a,b against the mixed layers, applying between about 55 and 175 MPa compaction pressure. The green compact is then removed from the die. The green compact is placed in a kiln F and heated slowly to a temperature at which the pore forming organic material is gradually volatilized, typically about 1000C to about 2750C. The tceratre is then raised over a period of several hours to between about 10500C and about 13000C, preferably between about 1050C and about 11750C, for a period of time until the calcium phosphate ceramic powder in all layers has fused. The fusing time depends on the dimensions of the mold, but will typically be between about 10 and about 200 minutes at temperatures above 10500C. The dense central layer 16 of the green compact fuses into a solid, non porous core.The ceramic particles 28 in the mixed layers 18 fuse together in the spatial arrangement which includes the voids left by the volatilized organic particles 26, whereby the surface layers 14 have substantial porosity. The sintered porous layers 14 are commonly covered with a thin, friable surface coating of sintered ceramic with significantly fewer exposed pores than are present just below this layer. This coating results from the compressive action of the faces of the punches 25 during compaction, and is easily scraped or machined away, leaving the desired porous surface texture. Although some shrinkage of the structure occurs during sintering as the sintering ceramic powder fills interstitial voids of the compressed powder, shrinkage is typically less than about 50 volume percent and less than about 28 percent in any dimension. Because of this relatively small amount of shrinkage overall, differential shrinkage between the core layer and surface layers is negligible There is no discontinuity at the interfaces between the porous and non porous layers, and a faultless bone graft is formed from which the porous surface layers will not spall or fragment after implantation. If the ceramic powder used is substantially pure hydroxylapatite, the dense solid hydroxylapatite core 12 has a density of at least 3.05g cm3, i.e., at least about 97 percent of the maximum theoretical density of hydroxylapatite. Its flexural strength, as measured by the modulus of rupture test, ASTM C369 56, is above about 137MN m2, and its compressive strength is above about 550MN m2 as measured by the compressive strength test, ASTM C4O7 58 its Knoop hardness is above about 450. If the ceramic powder used is substantially pure whitlockite, the dense solid whitlockite core has a density of at least 2.91g cm , i.e., at least about 97 of the maximum theoretical density of whitlockite.Its flexural strength, as measured by the modulus of rupture test ASTM C369 56 , is above 137MN m2, and its compressive strength is above 515MN m2 as measured by the compressive strength test, ASTM C407 58 its Knoop hardness is above 450. The compressive and flexural strength of the surface layers vary depending on their porosity, but are lower than that of the bulk, dense core. The strength of the ceramic bone graft approximates that of bone, however, due to its organic matrix, bone is much more compliant. The ceramic bone graft substitutes are designed to repair or replace bone segments that would experience predominantly compressive forces. While the porous surface layers 14 are not initially comparable in strength to the bone 22, after bone ingrowth has occurred fusing the bone and graft 10 into a unitary structure, the surface layers will provide a smooth transition in strength from the bone to the graft core 12. The strength of the grafts is such that, in the present state of development, the grafts formed in accordance with the invention are most generally suitable for replacing relatively small bone segements, e.g., having maximum cross sectional dimensions of about 40 mm, in areas where predominantly compressive forces are experienced. Replacements for long bone segments will generally have solid cores between about 5 and about 40 mm. in thickness. Larger grafts may be used for replacing bone segments which are not generally subjected to substantial tensile stress. After the bone graft is sintered, it may be machined G along its sides to any extent to more closely approximate the shape of the bone segment it is to replace, however it may only be machined on its porous surfaces such that a porous layer at least 100 microns thick remains to facilitate tissue ingrowth and initial stabilization upon implantation. For implantation, the bone is usually cut with cutting tools used routinely in orthopedic or oral maxillfacial surgical practice or with diamond burs, and the bone graft 10 and the bone graft is inserted with its porous surface layers 14 in intimate contact with osseous tissue at the prepared ends of the bone. The bone is immobilized in a conventional manner during a healing period in which osseous tissue grows into the pores of the surface layers and calcification occurs at the bone graft interfaces.

While the invention has been described in terms of certain preferred embodiments, modifications obvious to one with ordinary skill in the art might be made without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the porous surfaces need not be limited to end surfaces, and to the extent that a thin packed layer can be formed within a contoured mold, an organic material surface layer may be packed within the mold and the ceramic powder hydroxylapatite powder packed within a pocket created by a packed, contoured surface layer. An implant for an end of a bone, such as a finger tip, would be formed with a single porous surface layer. For long bone replacement, a composite structure might be strengthened by incorporating a reinforcing framework, e.g., one formed of metal wire, within the packed hydroxylapatite or whitlockite layer. Various features of the invention are emphasized in the following claims.
