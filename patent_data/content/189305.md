As in Method A, the order of steps in Stage 2 and Stage 3 may be altered under appropriate conditions. The potency of compounds of the invention to act as elastase inhibitors was initially determined by the ability of a compound of the invention to inhibit the action of human leukocyte elastase HLE on a low molecular weight peptide substrate. The potency of an inhibitor is evaluated by obtaining a kinetic determination of the dissociation constant, K Salt Extraction DNase Treatment The starting material, 193 g of purulent sputum, was homogenized with 200 ml of cold distilled water and centrifuged at 30,000 x gravity for 20 min. at 4 C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet extracted with high salt and treated with DNase as per the method of D. Y. Twumasi et al. in Without exception, all of the peptide derivatives of the present invention were found to be slow binding inhibitors of HLE and therefore required special methods of analysis to accurately determine K Animal models of emphysema include intratracheal i.t. administration of an elastolytic protease to cause a slowly progressive, destructive lesion of the lung. These lesions are normally evaluated a few weeks to a few months after the initial insult. However, these proteases also induce a lesion that is evident in the first few hours. The early lesion is first hemorrhagic, progresses to an inflammatory lesion by the end of the first 24 hours and resolves in the first week post insult. To take advantage of this early lesion, the following model was used. Hamsters are first lightly anesthetized with Brevital. Phosphate buffered saline PBS pH 7.4, either alone or containing 400 µg of human leukocyte elastase HLE , is then administered directly into the trachea. Twenty four hours later the animals are killed and the lungs removed and carefully trimmed of extraneous tissue. Following determination of wet lung weight, the lungs are lavaged with PBS and total lavagable red and white cells recovered are determined. The values for wet lung weights, total lavagable red cells and total lavagable white cells are elevated in a dose dependent manner following administration of HLE. Compounds that are effective elastase inhibitors can prevent or diminish the severity of the enzyme induced lesion resulting in lower wet lung weight and reduced values for total lavagable cells, both red and white, relative to administration of HLE alone. Compounds can be evaluated by administering them either with or at various times prior to administration of HLE to determine their utility in preventing an HLE lesion. Compounds of this invention produced statistically significant reductions in wet lung weight and total lavagable cells relative to HLE alone. Compounds of the present invention exhibited activity in at least one of the tests described above under Inhibition Measurement or Animal Model. It should be noted that there was not always a direct correlation between the activities of the compounds measured as K Drug levels are determined by first inactivating endogenous elastase inhibitors by incubation of 50 microliters of serum with an equal volume of buffer containing 5 mg ml bovine pancreatic trypsin for 5 min. The trypsin inactivated serum 10 microliters is then added to a 0.52 ml cuvette containing buffer made 20 nM with respect to HLE. After an additional 30 min. incubation, the reaction is started by the addition of substrate 350 microliters MeOSuc Ala Ala Pro Val pNA, 1.6 mm and the reaction monitored spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 410 nM. For comparative purposes, serum persistence of the test compounds are determined in the following manner Percent inhibition of serum samples were calculated as follows where Vo is the velocity obtained in the presence of control serum and Vi is the velocity of the inhibited reaction. Data are expressed as log percent inhibition vs. time post inhibitor administration. An approximate serum half life t½ is calculated from the resultant curve. The compounds of the present invention may be administered to a warm blooded animal in need thereof, particularly a human, for the treatment of conditions of pulmonary emphysema, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteo arthritis, in particular for emphysema. The mode of administration may be oral, parenteral, including the subcutaneous deposit by means of an osmotic pump, or via a powdered or liquid aerosol. These may be conventionally formulated in an oral or parenteral dosage form by compounding about 10 to 250 mg per unit of dosage with conventional vehicle, excipient, binder, preservative, stabilizer, flavor or the like as called for by accepted pharmaceutical practice e.g. as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,755,340. For parenteral administration, a 1 to 10 ml intravenous, intramusular or subcutaneous injection would be given containing about 0.02 to 10 mg kg of body weight of a compound of the invention 3 or 4 times daily. The injection would contain a compound of the invention in an aqueous isotonic sterile solution or suspension optionally with a preservative such as phenol or a solubilizing agent such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA . In a powdered aerosol, compounds of the invention may be administered in the same manner as cromolyn sodium via a Spinhaler turbo inhaler device obtained from Fisons Corp. of Bedford, Massachusetts at a rate of about 0.1 to 50 mg per capsule, 1 to 8 capsules being administered daily for an average human. Each capsule to be used in the Spinhaler contains the required amount of a compound of the invention with the remainder of the 20 mg capsule being a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as lactose. In a liquid aerosol, the compounds of the invention are administered at the rate of about 100 to 1000 micrograms per puff or activated release of a standard volume of propellant. The liquid aerosol would be given at the rate of 1 to 8 puffs per day with variation in dosages due to the severity of the condition being treated, the weight of the patient and the particle size distribution of the aerosol since smaller particles will achieve greater lung penetration. Propellants, e.g., a fluorinated hydrocarbon or isobutane, containers, valves and actuators for liquid aerosols are described by L.

After an additional 0.5 hr. the reaction mixture was filtered through Celite and concentrated under vacuum to give the product 26.0 g TLC, R An alternative method for making the compound of Example 1a is as follows. A 5 liter, 3 necked, round bottomed flask was equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, addition funnel and N₂ inlet. The flask was charged with AgNO₂ 1006.8, 6.54 mol in Et₂O 2.5 liter , and isobutyl iodide 927.2 g, 5.03 mol was placed in the addition funnel. Both the flask and the addition funnel were wrapped in aluminum foil to protect the reaction from light. After the stirred suspension was cooled to approximately 5 C ice bath , dropwise addition of the iodide over a 2 hr period was begun. The reaction temperature was maintained at or less than 5 C throughout the course of the addition. When the addition was complete, the reaction vessel was packed in ice and allowed to warm slowly to room temperature overnight. NMR analysis of an aliquot taken from the reaction mixture after 48 hr of stirring demonstrated that all of the isobutyl iodide had been consumed. The reaction mixture was filtered through Celite to remove silver salts and the filter cake was washed with Et₂O 3 x 500 ml . The combined filtrates were dried MgSO₄, filtered and concentrated on a rotary evaporator bath temp 35 C to about 600 ml. Fractional distillation atmospheric pressure caution potentially explosive gave the purified nitro compound 350.4 g, 68 yield b.p. 135 142 C.

The combined CH₂Cl₂ portions were washed with H₂O 1 liter and brine 1 liter . Drying MgSO₄ and concentration gave 854.6 g of crude product as a yellow oil. ¹H NMR showed the two diastereomeric nitro alcohols present in the ratio of about 3 1 as quantified by integration of the alcohol protons which consistently appear in the range δ6.0 6.5 when run in acetone d₆ contaminated by solvents and small amounts of starting materials. Distillation at reduced pressure gave the following fractions To simplify purifications in subsequent synthetic steps, an effort was made at this point to obtain the major diastereomeric pair in a substantially pure state and to advance only this material through the sequence. The major diastereomeric pair crystallizes from the mixture of diastereomers, as well as from cold pentane, to yield colorless needles. Thus, fraction C from the above distillation was allowed to crystallize overnight in a refrigerator. The product was collected, washed with cold pentane and dried for several hours in a vacuum oven Caution This material is somewhat volatile and significant quantities can be lost under extended vacuum treatment to give 52.0 g of substantially pure material. The fractions known by NMR to contain significant quantities of the desired isomer were repetitively treated in this fashion and redistilled to provide new fractions further enriched in the desired diastereomer to eventually obtain a total of 197.7 g of substantially pure nitro alcohol. This amount represents the type of work done, but it does not reflect the upper limit of the yield. Anhydrous EtOH 232 ml was added to 10 Pd C catalyst 2.30 g under N₂.

When a sample is plunged into a bath preheated to 110 C, it melts instantaneously. A solution of CBZ L Valine 100.0 g, 0.40 mol in DMF 1 liter, dried over sieves was added to a 3 liter, 3 necked, round bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, N₂ inlet and a thermometer.

The reaction was stirred for 3 hr at 0 C before allowing it to warm to room temperature and stir for 3 days. The reaction mixture was then filtered and the filtrate concentrated at reduced pressure. The filter cake was washed with EtOAc 3 x 1 liter , and concentration of the resultant filtrate gave material that was combined with the residue from concentration of the DMF solution. The combined product mixture about 2.5 liters was diluted with Et₂O 2 liters and stored in the refrigerator overnight. Precipitate was removed by filtration.

This material was flash chromatographed on silica gel 3.5 kg with gradient elution CH₂Cl₂ to 5 MeOH CH₂Cl₂ 5 95 . Mixed fractions were subjected to repeated chromatography to remove impurities. Combination of the fractions containing the desired product gave 500.7 g 87 of material contaminated with a small amount of low R A methanolic 4 liters solution of the product of Example 5a 500.7 g, 1.38 mol was added to a 12 liter, 3 necked, round bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and an N₂ inlet. To the stirred solution was added 1 N NaOH 1.4 liters , bringing the pH to approximately 13. After the reaction had stirred for 3 hr, the pH dropped to 11. Additional 1 N NaOH 0.1 liter was used to bring the pH to 12 and the reaction was stirred overnight at room temperature. MeOH was removed from the reaction mixture by concentration on a rotary evaporator. During the course of the solvent removal, a total of 1 liter of H₂O was added to reduce the concentration of the base.

The product of Example 4c 62.8 g, 0.302 mol in THF 300 ml was then added at such a rate that the temperature was maintained at 35 C. After the addition was complete, the temperature was kept 35 C for 1 hr before the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature with stirring overnight. The reaction mixture was filtered and the filter cake was washed with THF 1 liter . The combined filtrates were concentrated to give 189 g of crude product. This material was flash chromatographed on silica gel 5000 ml and eluted with THF toluene 1 9 . Once product began to elute, the solvent polarity was altered in gradient fashion THF toluene 15 85 THF toluene 20 80 and, finally MeOH THF toluene 2.5 30 70 MeOH use was minimized to prevent the elution of low R NOTE Maintenance of the internal temperatures quoted in this procedure appears to be crucial for obtaining substantially pure product.
