# Process for purifying hydrocarbonaceous oils.

## Abstract
A process for purifying hydrocarbonaceous oils containing heteroatom sulfur and heteroatom nitrogen compound impu rities comprising the steps of 1 reacting said hydrocarbonaceous oil with an oxidizing gas containing at least one nitrogen oxide with more than one oxygen atom for each nitrogen atom while maintaining a the molar ratio of the nitrogen oxide to the total of the sulfur heteroatom content and the nitrogen hetero atom content to about 1.5 1 or less, b the reaction time to about one hour or less, c the temperature to about 100 C or less, and d a conversion of sulfur heteroatom content into gas eous sulfur oxides to about 60 or less on a weight basis 2 contacting the oil from step 1 above with i an extracting solvent comprising at least one amine selected from the group consisting of ethylene di amine, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine and mix tures thereof, or a water mixture thereof containing about 50 by weight or less water, and ii an extracting solvent comprising formic acid or a water mixture thereof containing about 50 by weight or less water, with the contacting with i and ii being sequential and in any order and 3 separating said oil from step 2 above from the extracting solvents to recover purified hydrocarbonaceous oil.
