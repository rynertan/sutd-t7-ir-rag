# A clocked static memory.

## Abstract
A clocked static memory comprising a memory matrix 10 including a plurality of static memory cells 11 arranged in rows and columns and providing a voltage differential at bit lines 13, 14 whenever an associated memory cell is selected. Sense amplifiers 22 are connected between the bit lines of each column and a sense clock line 27 connected to a sense driver 40 crosses transistors in a sense amplifier 22 in each column. A logic circuit 50 detects the actual data output on data lines 15, 16 coupled to the bit lines and is buffered by an amplifier 51 to provide a memory status output signal indicating the existence of valid data output.
