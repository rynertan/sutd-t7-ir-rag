# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO BAND SAWS

## Abstract
In a band saw particularly adapted for cutting meat, blade scrapers 25, 26 remove debris from the band saw blade 18 and throw it laterally and forwardly of the blade 18 into an enclosure 40 , which can be removed without the use of tools for cleaning and for disposing of the collected debris. The location of the blade scrapers 25,26 is slaved to the location of the saw blade 18 so as automatically to maintain the proper relationship for most efficient debris removal without adjustment.
