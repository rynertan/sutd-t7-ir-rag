# PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF SUBMICRON SIZED TITANIUM DIBORIDE POWDERS

## Abstract
Ultrafine TiB₂ powder is produced by subjecting a gaseous mixture of BCl₃, H₂, and TiCl₄ to an amount of laser radiation effective to convert at least a portion of the volatile boron and titanium sources to TiB₂. The TiB₂ powders consist primarily of monodispersed equiaxial particles having a diameter of 0.025 to 0.3 µm.
