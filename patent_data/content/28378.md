# Improved hydroformylation process using stable rhodium catalyst.

## Abstract
In a rhodium catalyzed hydroformylation process which produces aldehydes from olefins, the stability of a rhodium catalyst complexed with carbon monoxide and a phosphine ligand is improved by the use of a ligand selected from a branched chain alkyldiphenylphosphine, a branched chain dialkylphenylphosphine, a cycloalkyldiphenylphosphine and a dicycloalkylphenylphosphine.
