## Description
PROJECTILE PROPULSIVE DEVICEThe present invention relates to projectile propulsive devices and is particularly although not exclusively concerned with a projectile launching device for launching a projectile containing equipment which needs to be deployed at a location remote from the launching site.Several types of projectile launching devices have been proposed which utilise air or gas under pressure for propulsion of the projectile from the launcher. They have, however, been found to have disadvantages particularly when used for launching a projectile containing equipment.In one type of launcher hitherto proposed, the projectile is held in place in a launcher barrel by a catch mechanism while air under pressure is applied to the base of the projectile. The projectile is launched by releasing the catch mechanism and allowing the pressurised air acting on the base of the projectile to propel the projectile along the barrel. A disadvantage of this type of launcher is that as extremely high loads are developed by the pressurised air acting on the base of the projectile prior to firing an extremely robust releasable catch mechanism is required. Furthermore, there is the disadvantage that the projectile needs to be of such a design that the catch mechanism can cooperate with it.In another type of launcher hitherto proposed, air under pressure is sealed from the launcher barrel by a frangible disc which at the time of firing is ruptured to allow air to flow into the barrel. The disc may be so designed as to rupture upon the pressurised air applied to it exceeding a preset pressure or by a piercing device. A principal disadvantage of this launcher is that the disc requires replacement after each firing.In yet another launcher which has been proposed air under pressure is supplied to the barrel of the launcher from a reservoir under the control of a valve remote from the barrel, firing of the projectile being carried out simply by opening the valve. A disadvantage of this launcher is that the valves used are slow to respond and give rise to considerable flow losses between the reservoir and the barrel with a consequent loss of propulsive energy.In still yet another launcher hitherto proposed a chamber for containing air under pressure communicates with the bore of the barrel through one or more lateral apertures in the barrel which are sealed by the projectile itself when it is in position in the barrel ready for launching. The projectile is launched by initially advancing it to a position in which the lateral aperture or apertures become uncovered, whereupon the pressurised air flows from the chamber and acts on the base of the projectile to accelerate it along the barrel. A disadvantage of this launcher is that the projectile side wall must be capable of withstanding the pressure of air applied to it through the lateral aperture or apertures.In particular, for projectiles of consider able size the part of the wall of the projectile which closes off the aperture or apertures need to be of robust construction and use cannot be made of lightweight low strength materials.Furthermore, calculations show that more energy may be utilised to accelerate this wall section of the projectile than that required to accelerate the useful payload. Another disadvantage is that seals are required either in the barrel or on the projectile to provide adequate sealing of the aperture or apertures and it is found that a considerable force is required to push the projectile manually into its firing position.For large launchers this can amount to several thousand newtons, making loading very inconvenient.A need arises from time to time for a launcher which can be used for testing equipment required to withstand high propulsive forces. The launcher proposed in which the projectile itself seals off the pressurised air from the barrel of the launcher is however unsatisfactory for this purpose as the projectile containing the equipment needs to be of considerable size and therefore robust and heavy. A large dummy projectile may alternatively be employed to effect the necessary seal and to push to the projectile containing the equipment along the barrel, but the dummy projectile itself may then be considerably heavier than the test payload.It is an object of the present invention to provide a projectile launching device for launching a projectile under the action of air or gas under pressure, which does not suffer from the above mentioned disadvantages. According to the present invention there is provided a projectile propulsive device for propelling a projectile under the action of fluid under pressure comprising a barrel having an axial bore in which a projectile to be propelled is, in use, located, a chamber for containing fluid under pressure and communicating with the bore of the barrel through one or more lateral apertures in the barrel and a closure element movable between a closed position in which it closes the aperture or apertures and an open position in which it no longer closes the aperture or apertures.Preferably, the closure element comprises a sleeve coaxially mounted with respect to the bore of the barrel and axially displaceable along the barrel between the closed and open positions.In a preferred embodiment of the invention, sleeve displacement means are provided for exerting an axial displacement load on the sleeve to produce a predetermined initial displacement of the sleeve from the closed position in the direction of the open position and the sleeve is so constructed and arranged in the barrel that upon the predetermined initial displacement from the closed position it becomes subjected by the fluid under pressure from the chamber to an axial displacement load accelerating it to the open position. The sleeve is furthermore so constructed and arranged that when it is in the closed position it is subjected either to no axial displacement load by the fluid under pressure in the chamber or to an axial displacement load tending to hold it in the closed position. In embodiments of the invention hereinafter to be described the barrel is formed with an axially extending circumferential guide slot and the sleeve is axially slidable within the guide slot between the closed and open positions. In the preferred embodiment, the guide slot is formed in a forwardly extending portion of the rear end of the barrel and the sleeve is movable rearwardly from the closed position to the open position. The inner surface of the sleeve conforms to the bore of the barrel and the sleeve is arranged to engage an abutment in the bore of the barrel when in the closed position.The sleeve displacement means in the preferred embodiment of the invention comprises means for supplying to an end face of the end of the sleeve projecting from the guide slot fluid under pressure to produce an axial displacement load on the sleeve to move it from the closed position in the direction of the open position. In an alternative embodiment of the invention to be described the sleeve is mounted in an enlarged barrel portion and within the annular space provided by the chamber and the guide slot is formed in the enlarged barrel portion.While the embodiments of the invention hereinafter to be described are projectile launching devices for the aerial launching of a projectile from a barrel the forward end of which is open, the projectile propulsive device according to the invention may be used for producing impact loads by arranging for the forward end of the barrel to be closed so as to receive impact forces from the projectile.The fluid to be used is preferably air or gas under high pressure.Embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a schematic cross sectional view of a projectile launching device according to a first embodiment of the invention ready for firing, Figure 2 is a schematic cross sectional view corresponding to that shown in Figure 1 in a disposition following firing, Figure 3 is a schematic diagram of a pneumatic control circuit for controlling the operation of the device shown in Figures 1 and 2, Figure 4 is a schematic cross sectional view of a projectile launching device according to a second embodiment of the invention, and Figure 5 is a schematic cross sectional view of a projectile launching device according to a third embodiment of the invention.Referring first to Figure 1 the projectile launching device shown comprises a barrel 11 having a forward barrel portion 12 to the rear end of which is secured an intermediate barrel portion 13 by a collar 14 held against the forward end face of the portion 13 by a plurality of screws 15, only one of which is shown inFigure 1, and two end portions 16 and 17 held against the rear end face of the intermediate portion 13 by a plurality of screws 18, only one of which is shown inFigure 1.The end portion 16 consists of a hollow cylindrical section 19 terminating in a flange 20 by which it is secured to the end face of the intermediate portion 13.The end portion 17 is likewise formed with a hollow cylindrical section 21 closed at its forward end by an end section 22 and provided at its rear end with a flange 23 by which it is secured to the end face of the intermediate portion 13.The cylindrical sections 19 and 21 of the end portions 16 and 17 are radially spaced from each other to form an axially extending circumferential guide slot 24 which receives a sleeve 25 slidable within the slot 24.The intermediate portion 13 is formed with a cylindrical wall section 26 and end sections 27 and 28 which together with the cylindrical section 19 of the end portion16 form an annular space 29 which is closed off from the bore of the barrel by the sleeve 25 as shown inFigure 1, but which is in direct communication with the bore of the barrel when the sleeve 25 is in the position shown in Figure 2 via an aperture 30 defined by the rear end wall of the forward section 27 of the intermediate portion 13 and the forward end of the section 19 of the end portion 16. The sleeve 25 in the position shown in Figure 1 engages with seals 31 and 32 and abuts against the rear end face of the forward portion 12 of the barrel. 0 ring seals 33 and 34 are provided in the cylindrical sections 19 and 21 of the end portions 16 and 17 and a further 0 ring seal 35 is provided at the rear end of the guide slot 24. Further seals 36 to 39 are also provided.Inlets 40,41 and 42 are internally threaded to receive high pressure hose couplings for supplying pressurised air for the operation of the launching device. The inlet 40 is in direct communication with the annular space 29 to which air under pressure is to be supplied for providing the launching thrust for a projectile 53, which is front loaded into the barrel 11 and which in the firing position rests on spacer screw 73 screwed into the section 22. The inlet 42 communicates through ducts 142, 143 and 144 with the guide slot 24 for supplying air under pressure to the slot 24. The inlet 41 communicates through a duct 141 with an intermediate end face of the sleeve 25 for the supply of air under pressure to the sleeve to displace it from the closed position in the direction of the open position shown inFigure 2.A pneumatic control system for controlling the application of air under pressure to the inlets 40 to 42 is illustrated in Figure 3 and comprises two position spring biased control valves 43 and 44 each provided with a relief port to atmosphere, a two position on off valve 45 provided with a relief port to atmosphere, a metering valve 46 with an associated non return valve, a pressure regulator 47 with a relief port to atmosphere, and a pressure gauge 48.Air under high pressure from a supply cylinder not shown is applied to an input 49 of the control system and fed through line 50 to the two position valve 45 which in the position shown provides a communication between the line 50 and an output line 51. Air under pressure in line 51 is applied to the two position valve 43 which is spring biased to the cut off position shown in Figure 3, preventing air under pressure from being supplied to output line 52. Similarly air under pressure is fed on line 54 to valve 44 likewise spring biased to its cut off position as shown in Figure 3 and preventing air under pressure from being supplied to output line 55. Finally air under pressure on the line 51 is applied through line 56 and the manually operable metering valve 46 to output line 57.With the valves 43,44 and 45 in the positions shown inFigure 3 and with the metering valve 46 open air under pressure is fed to inlet 40 of the device shown inFigures 1 and 2 to charge the annular space 29 with highly pressurised air. The metering valve 46 is then closed. To fire the launching device, the valve 44 is next operated to move it from the position shown inFigure 3 to its other position in which pressurised air on line 54 is fed through it to inlet 41 and through duct 141 to an intermediate front end face of the sleeve 25. As the inlet 42 is connected by the valve 43 to atmosphere in the position of the valve 43 shown inFigure 3 the sleeve 25 is moved under the high pressure air rearwardly in the launching device.As soon as the sleeve 25 moves clear of the seals 31 and 32 and into the region of the annular space 29 the high pressure air in the space 29 rapidly accelerates the sleeve 25 into the retracted position shown in Figure 2. With the rapid retraction of the sleeve 25 the base of the projectile 53, which is held spaced from the end section 22 by a set screw 73, is acted upon over its full area by the pressurised air from the chamber 29 causing the projectile 53 to be propelled with high acceleration along the forward portion 12 of the barrel and to be launched from the end of the barrel. After firing of the projectile 53 the pressurised air charge in the annular space 29 is expended and the device then needs to be re set for the firing of a further projectile.Re setting of the launching device shown in Figures 1 and 2 is effected by momentarily operating the control valve 43 so that it transmits air under pressure from the line 51 to the line 52 and inlet 42. Pressurised air at the inlet 42 is transmitted via ducts 142, 143 and 144 to the rear end of the guide slot, causing the slide 25 to advance from the position shown in Figure 2 back to the position shown in Figure 1. The metering valve 46 is then opened to supply pressurised air through line 57 to inlet 40 for re charging the annular space 29 and is then closed, leaving the launching device ready for firing a further projectile front loaded into the forward barrel portion 12. The two position on off valve 45, which is normally in the position shown in Figure 3, can be operated in an emergency to switch it into its other position in which it vents the line 51 to atmosphere and clears the launching device of pressurised air. Referring now to Figure 4, the launching device comprises a barrel 58 formed with a forward portion 59, an intermediate portion 60 and an end portion 61 closed by a removable breech element 62. The intermediate portion 60 has an outer cylindrical wall 63, a lower inner wall 64 and an upper inner wall 65, which together with end sections of the intermediate portion 60 define an annular space 66 and a lateral aperture 67 providing a communication between the annular space 66 and the bore of the barrel 58. The breech element 62 and the inner wall 64 of the intermediate portion 60 define a guide slot 68 for the reception of a sleeve 69 slidabie within it from the position shown in Figure 4 to a retracted position in which it lies within the slot 68.Inlets 70,71 and 72 are provided for the supply of pressurised air to charge the annular space 66, to displace the sleeve 69 from the position shown in Figure 4 to its retracted position and to reset the sleeve 69 following firing of the device. O ring seals are formed in the inner walls 64 and 65 for cooperation with the sleeve 69 and an end seal is provided to seal off the rear end of the guide slot 68.The operation of the device shown in Figure 4 for launching a projectile 53 is principally the same as that of the device shown in Figures 1 and 2 and may be controlled by a pneumatic control system as illustrated in Figure 3 where the inlets 40,41 and 42 are replaced by inlets 70,71 and 72 of Figure 4. The projectile 53 may however be breech loaded by removing the breech element 62, inserting the projectile and replacing the breech element. In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figure 5, a barrel 74 of the launcher is so constructed as to provide an annular space 75 which communicates with the bore of the barrel through a lateral aperture 76, which is closed by a sleeve 77 slidable from the position shown in Figure 5 in which it closes the aperture 76 to a retracted position in which it is retracted within a guide slot 78 against the action of a biasing spring 79.Inlet 80 is provided for the supply of pressurised air to.the annular space 75 and inlet 81 for the supply of pressurised air to a circumferential channel 83 in the rear end of the sleeve 77.The sleeve 77 is biased by the spring 79 into its closed position as shown in Figure 5 in which it closes off the annular space 75 from the bore of the barrel and firing of the projectile 53 is effected by applying air under pressure to the inlet 81 to lift the rear end of the sleeve 77 off the base of the barrel, whereupon the pressurised air in the annular space 75 becomes effective to accelerate the sleeve 77 forwardly into the slot 78 against the action of the spring 79. Air from the annular space 75 then passes through the lateral aperture 76 and acts on the base of the projectile 53 for propelling it forwardly along the barrel. The sleeve 77 is automatically re set into its closed position as shown in Figure 5 by the action of the biasing spring 79. A pneumatic control system for this embodiment of the invention may conveniently comprise that shown in Figure 3 with the re set control valve 43 and inlet 42 omitted and the inlets 40 and 41 replaced by inlets 80 and 81. By controlling the acceleration and or velocity of the sleeve in the embodiments of the invention hereinbefore described, it is possible to influence the acceleration and velocity of the projectile.In the embodiments of the invention hereinbefore described, the closure element takes the form of a sleeve. It will however be appreciated that it may take other forms and in one alternative construction it may take the form of an end cap which closes the lateral aperture in the same manner as the sleeve.
