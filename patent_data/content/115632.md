# Transition detector circuit.

## Abstract
A noise tolerant transition detector circuit 10 for de tecting when an input signal rises above a first value V2 and falls below a second value VI comprising comparator means 12, 14 which produces a first output signal when the input signal rises above the first value and a second output signal when the input signal falls below the second value and bistable means 20 which is set to its first stable state in response to the comparator means first output signal and which is set to its second stable state in response to the comparator means second output signal. Noise may be further reduced by using further bistable means 26 and pulse forming means 28, 32, 34, 36 may also be employed.
