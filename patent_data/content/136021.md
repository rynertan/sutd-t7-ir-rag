# Bandages, components thereof and use.

## Abstract
An orthopaedic bandage is described which comprises a support carrying a vinyl compound which compound polymerises when exposed to a water activated vinyl polymerisation catalyst. The vinyl compound is a hydrophilic prepolymer which contains more than one polymerisable vinyl group. This prepolymer is in association with at least one component of a water activatable vinyl polymerisation redox catalyst in solid form in a water pervious coating which is insoluble in the prepolymer. Encapsula tion of one component of the catalyst system in a water pervious coating provides a storage stable bandage which is activated by immersion in water and gives a satisfactory working time for immobilising a limb compared to use of an uncoated catalyst.
