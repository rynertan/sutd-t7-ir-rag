# Memory disc drive.

## Abstract
An optical disc drive system in which the empty sleeve component 12 of an optical disc cartridge is utilized to lock the optical disc in its operational position while occupying a storage location within the drive system. The locking storage feature is achieved by providing adjacent to the conventional disc insertion opening 6 in the drive frame an additional opening 8 for receipt of the empty sleeve component 12 and by providing guides within the drive for positioning the empty sleeve over the optical disc 20 . The empty sleeve cooperates with a spring loaded frame disc lowering mechanism which lowers the optical disc to the drive spindle where it is held by a magnetic force generated by a magnetized portion of the spindle. The sleeve also cooper ates with a frame sleeve latching mechanism 203 to facilitate withdrawal of a frame supported optical disc from the sleeve and reinsertion of the frame supported optical disc back into the sleeve. A plurality of spring loaded members support the frame member before the sleeve actuates the lowering mechanism and free the optical disc from the spindle upon withdrawal of the sleeve from its locking storage position.
