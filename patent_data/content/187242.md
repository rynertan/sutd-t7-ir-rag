# Process for preparing a latex of grafted copolymer particles.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an improved method for forming a grafted rubbery particle suitable for use as a reinforcing rubber in a thermoplastic resin. The grafted rubbery particles produced by the method of the present invention have a substantially continuous, generally uniform layer of polymer grafted to the rubbery particle core.
