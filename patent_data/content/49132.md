## Description
A CONNECTORTHIS invention relates to a connector suitable for use as a lamp holder. More particularly but not exclusively, the invention concerns a lamp holder suitable for connecting an electric lamp bulb to a supply cable, especially in mining applications.Known electric lamp bulb fittings used in mining applications include those having a body defining a housing for the connection of the bulb to an electric supply lead or cable, the body having a cover which is screwedly received thereon. This arrangement is disadvantageous in that an imperfect seal in the region of connection of the cover to the body may result.Sparks resulting, for example, from shorts at the connection between the bulb and the supply cable from the current take off point may ignite dangerous gases which are present in the underground passages of some mines. Also, copious quantities of water are used in some underground mines and the danger exists that water may penetrate the body and wash the connections between the bulb and supply cable. It is an object of this invention to provide a connector suitable for use as a lamp holder with which the above disadvantages of known arrangements are least minimized.According to the invention, a connector suitable for use as a lamp holder includes a casing for accommodating a lamp bulb and at least one port for the ingress of an electrical lead to the interior of the casing, the arrangement being characterized in that the walls of the port engage with the leads.In a preferred form of the invention, the leads are sheathed in resilient insulating material and the walls of the port engage with the sheath.The casing may include a lamp base defining a socket for accommodating the bulb, the rear of the base being closed by a cap and the arrangement being characterized in the provision of ports defined between the base and the cap.The base and cap are preferably telescopically engageable to diminish the effective area of the ports, thereby to nip the lead in the portsThe base and cap may be lockingly engaged by the provision of snap action engagement formations. For instance, in one preferred embodiment of a connector according to the invention, the base includes a plurality of spaced circumferentially disposed, radially outwardly projecting protrusions which are adapted to snap into complementaty cavities in the nature of apertures provided in a skirt of the cap.In this form of a connector according to the invention, the interior of the closed casing is filled with a polymeric foam material once the electrical connections for the bulb have been made. Preferably the fo material is suitably treated so as to be water repellant and fire retardant.In an alternative embodiment of a lamp holder according to the invention, the base and cap are locked in sealing engagement by the provision of a circumferentially disposed, radially outwardly projecting tongue which is adapted to snap into a mating groove disposed in the bore of the cap, the walls of the port effecting a sealing engagement with the sheath.The casing preferably provides an anchorage for a transparent cover for the bulb.A seal may be located at the interface between the base and cover to seal the bulb within the connector.With this arrangement, the bulb and with its connections to the electrical supply cable are protectively housed within the connector according to the invention. In the presently preferred embodiment, the foam material is impregnated with suitable water repellant and fire retardant materials, the connections being thereby protected. Where the base and cap are locked in sealing engagement, the connections for the bulb to the supply cable are disposed within a chamber which is substantially air tight and water tight. The arrangement of the invention hereby circumvents the dangers associated with sparks igniting gases present in the mine and is also advantageous in that the danger of water washing the electrical connections of the bulb and supply cable is minimized.The invention will now be described by way of illustration only with reference to the accompanying drawings in whichFigure 1 is a part perspective, part sectional view of one presently preferred connector according to the invention, illustrated in a partially exploded condition, andFigure 2 is a similar view of an alternative embodiment of a connector according to the invention, illustrated in a simplified form. Referring to the drawings, in which like numerals denote like parts, a connector suitable for use as a lamp holder includes a casing defining a chamber adapted to house connections between leads for an electric lamp bulb 10 and a supply cable 12 supplying electricity to the bulb from a current take off point. The casing is of a two part construction and is comprised of a first, generally cone shaped base 14 and a second, generally dish shaped cap 16, the rear of the base 14 being closed by the cap 16.The rear of the base 14 is defined by a projecting wall 18 provided with a pair of oppositely disposed, generally U shaped slots 20.The mouth of the cap l6 is defined by a projecting skirt 22, likewise provided with a pair of oppositely disposedU shaped slots 24. Slots 24 are complementarily arranged relative to the slots 20 of the base 14 soyas to be capable of providing a pair of oppositely disposed ports in the assembled casing.The surface of the base 14 opposite the projecting wall 18 includes a central socket 22 for the reception of the bulb 10. By way of example, the socket 22 as shown in the embodiment of Figure 1 is provided with a fitting 27 suitable for securing a bulb 10 having a bayonet type attachment member. Also merely by way of example, the embodiment illustrated in Figure 2 is provided with a barrel 26 defining an internally screw threaded socket 22 to receive an bulb 10 having an externally screw threaded attachment member. It will, however, be appreciated that any convenient attachment member may be provided for the bulb.The surface of the base 14 opposite the projecting wall 18 is provided with an externally screw threaded shoulder 28 in the nature of an anchorage for a transparent cover 30 for the bulb. The cover 30 is complementarily screw threaded in its mouth region. A suitable seal is provided at the interface between the base 14 and cover 30 for sealing the bulb 10 interiorly of the connector. In the embodiment illustrated inFigure l, a flat seal 58 is provided in the upper region of the shoulder 28 while a ring seal 60 of substantially circular cross section is provided in the lower region between the shoulder 28 and cover 30. The connector ofFigure 2 is provided with a single seal 62 between the shoulder 28 and cover 30. Any convenient arrangement whereby the bulb is connectable to the supply cable 12 may be provided. For example, an electrically conductive and insulating element not shown of a kind commonly available may be seated in a convenient cavity provided in the internal closed end throat wall of the socket 22. Suitable apertures permitting communication between the socket 22 and the interior of the casing may be provided to permit connection of a live lead 32 and a neutral lead 34 tothe electrically conductive element. As illustrated by way of example in Figure 1, the bulb attachment member 27 is secured in the socket by a pair of externally screw threaded shafts 46 for the bulb connector leads 48 and 50 for connection of the bulb to the live and neutral leads 32 and 34 of the supply cable 12. The cap 16 comprises a substantially circular land surface 36 and a peripheral skirt 22. A pair of oppositely arranged hooks 38 are provided externally on the land surface 36. The mouths 40 of the hooks 38 are adapted to receive a cable, wire or the like not shown so as to permit the assembled connector to hang from the cable. In a practical arrangement1 the hooks may be secured to an overhanging cable such as those which aregenerally provided along the upper wall of an underground passage in a mine. The dimensions of the hooks will be determined by the dimensions of the cable from which the lamp holder is hung and by the demands of moulding techniques.An armoured cable 12 shown only in Figure 1 for clarity is generally used in supplying electricity to underground locations in mining operations. This armoured cable carries either two or four electrically conductive leads and is accordingly referred to as being either two core,las shown in Figure il or four core armoured electrical cable. A plurality of either helically or longitudinally extending wire strands indicated generally by the numeral 42 are arranged about the leads 32 and 34 in the cable, which strands 42 serve as the earth for the cable 12. This construction of leads and earth is commonly contained and protected by a resiliently compressible polymeric thermoplastic sheath 44.To prepare the armoured cable for connection to the leads for the bulb, a suitable length of sheath material 44 and ear thing strands 42 are removed to expose the electrical core leads 32 and 34. The ends of the bulb connector leads 48 and 50 may then be connected to their respective core supply leads 32 and 34.On assembly of the connector according to the invention, the armoured supply cable 12 is located in the slots 20 to lie across the base 14 as indicated in Figure 1 in which a portion of supply cable 12 has been removed for clarity. The cap 16 is then aligned with the base 14 so that the slots 20 and 24 are in register and the cable is capable of being similarly received in the slots 24 of the cap 16.The base 14 and cap 16 are then telescoped together.The circumferentially disposed, radially outwardly projecting protrusions 52 shown in Figure 1 are urged over a bridge 54 and engage in complementary apertures 56 provided in the skirt 22. The base 14 and cap 16 are thereby locked together.Once the base 14 and cap 16 have been locked on the supply cable 12, a suitable aperture lnot shown may be made in, for example, the land surface 36 of the cap 16 and a suitable polymeric foam material introduced therethrough into the interior of the housing.Applicant has found that any one of the foamable materials commonly available in two part liquid form for example, a polyurethane foam, are suitable and may be poured in liquid form through the aperture. The material then foams to fill the interior of the casing and the aperture.The base 14 and cap 16 may be made of a suitable synthetic polymeric material such as poly butylene terepthalate. Preferably the polymeric material is treated so as to be fire proof and may be coloured so as to be substantially luminescent. The cover 30 for the bulb 10 may be made of any suitable transparent material such as a polycarbonate material which is relatively impact resistant. The transparent cover may also be coloured, different colours denoting the proximity of different work stations, dangerous areas and the like in the mine.Applicant has found that since the connector is constructed from three basic parts, any one of a number of sealants may conveniently be used to seal the interfaces between the cap and base and the base and cover, to ensure that the possibly dangerous leads and their connections are effectively protected. Applicant has found that any one of the wide range of silicon rubber sealants may effectively be employed for this purpose.In the embodiment shown in Figure 2, the base 14 and cap 16 are telescoped together so that a circumferentially disposed, radially outwardly projecting tongue 64 is sealingly engaged in a suitable groove not shown provided in the throat region of the cap 16, the walls of the ports effecting a sealing engagement with the sheath 44 not shown in Figure 2 for clarity . The connections between the bulb 10 and cable 12 are thus housed within a sealed chamber. Although the invention has been illustrated and described with respect to presently preferred embodiments, many variations and modifications of the concepts disclosed would be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the appended claims and it is intended that all such variations and modifications be encompassed within the scope of the appended claims. For example, although the invention has been described with reference to a casing made from poly butylene terepthalate, it is possible that it could be made from any one of a number of suitable polymeric thermoplastic materials. It will also be understood that adapting the number of ports in the casing can yield any one of a 2 way, 3 way, 4 way or a terminal box type connector suitable for use as a lamp holder.
