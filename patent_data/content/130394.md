# A pleating machine for pleating cloth with mutually converging folds.

## Abstract
The invention relates to the field of cloth pleating machines, and in particular, to a pleating machine for pleat ing cloth with mutually converging folds. The technical prob lem to be solved was that of providing a pleating machine which could also work accurately and reliably on highly flabby and or hard to fold fabrics. The problem has been solved by providing a pleating machine 1 having an angularly oscillating arm 4 and an abutment wall 6 for said arm 4 , which are configured comb like to be mutually interleaved, and provided with control and guiding devices for said wall 6 which are operative to drive the same through a cyclic oscillation along a closed path causing said wall 6 to move from a position close against a cloth to be pleated to one of insertion in said arm 4 over and past a cloth flap which has been folded by said arm.
