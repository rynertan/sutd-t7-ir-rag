## Description
A METHOD FOR PRODUCING BASIC ALUMINIUM SULPHATEDESCRIPTIONTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to a method for producing polynucleate basic aluminium sulphate which gives in aqueous solution positively charged polynucleate complexes having charge neutralizing properties in systems containing suspended or colloidal, negatively charged particles.The object of the present invention is to provide a rational method for the industrial production of polynucleate basic aluminium sulphate.Background ArtA number of aluminium products which contain polynucleate aluminium ions in solution are known to the art. These products are the result of a requirement for more effective chemicals in, for example, the fields of water purification, paper siding, and plant de watering.When used in these particular fields, the polynucleate products exhibit far superior qualities than do previously used simple compounds, due to the higher charge of the metal ions. In principle, two different kinds of aluminium products have been developed with the aim of improved efficiency in the aforesaid context these products being firstly chlorid based basic aluminium compounds and secondly sulphate based aluminium compounds. Of the first mentioned group there was developed first a polyaluminium chlorid PAC of the general formula AlClx OH n where x is 3, normally 1 2. These compounds and methods for their manufacture have been described in, for example, SE,B,7 201 333 7, SE,B,7 405 237 4, SE,B,7 412 965 1,SE,B,7 503 641 8 and DE,A,2 630 768. The other kind of aluminium chloride solutions, PALC, which are also based on a content of the same polynucleate complexes, have general summary formuli which can be written thus A1C13 . x AOHS n where A is alkali metal, and x AlCl3 . 2 B OH 2 n where B is an alkali earth metal, n is a positive integer, and x is a value within the range of 1 2.7.Polynucleate aluminium chloride solutions of the PALC type are found described in FR,A1, 7 512 975, according to which the solutions are produced by alkalizing aluminium chloride solutions with solutions of alkali hydroxide. According to this publication, however, it has not been possible to produce clear, stable solutions other than in a highly diluted state. By stable solution11 is menat here and in the following a solution which does not change with respect to compositon and properties, not even when stored for extended period of time. Thus, it is stated in the publication that under certain conditions, it is possible to obtain a solution with up to 0.40 moles of aluminium per litre. The stability of this solution, however, is greatly limited, and it is necessary to inject the solution directly into the water to be purified.It is clearly evident from the publication, and in particular from the working examples, that solutions having aluminium concentrations in excess of about 0.1 mole per litre cannot be expected to be effective and stable in the PALC solutions known according to the publication.Sulphate based basic aluminium compounds are found described inEP,A, 79850039 3 EP,A, 80850033 4 and SE,A, 8101830 1.These products have to a greater or lesser extent polynucleate metal ions in solution, and are therefore effective water purifying substances. The sulphate based products can also be used for purposes other than for purifying water, where the presence of the polynucleate metal ions favours the achievement of desired effects.In certain cases, however, it is desirable, and at times even necessary, to restrict the supply of sulphate ions to the greatest possible extent with applications made in the aforementioned fields, particularly when purifying drinking water. This is particularly important in systems which are repeatedly used and cleansed in order to eliminate the risk of the accumulation of sulphate in tissues, and in water from the aspect of concrete corrosion. This, therefore, applies to certain water purifying systems where there is a lack of water, rendering it necessary to use the water for as long as possible, with intermediate water purifications.After having been cleansed ten times with conventional aluminium sulphate or compositions having corresponding sulphate contents FALS , the sulphate content of such water is so high that the water will attack the water piping system resulting in troublesome leakages. The problem of sulphate ion enrichment has now also manifested itself in the papermaking industry, in which for environmental reasons the water system is closed to a large extent. Excessively high percentages of salts in the paper stock seriously disturb the manufacturing processes.In US 4,238,347 there is proposed a method for producing a basic aluminium sulphate which is poor in sulphate and which has the formula Al OH SO4 y H2PO4 z H20 w where x is 0.75 1.5 y is 0.7 1.07 z is 0 0.2 and w is 2.0 4.2, x 2y z being equal to 3.The compounds are produced by reacting aluminium sulphate with ground calcium carbonate, optionally in the presence of phosphoric acid, and by filtering the reaction mixture to separate the gypsum formed. It has been found, however, that the carbon dioxide departing from the reaction with the calcium carbonate, together with the gypsum, creates enormous problems with respect to process techniques, due to the foam formed, which, especially with high aluminium sulphate concentrations, cannot be broken up. It is even impossible to break up effectively the foam when foam inhibitors are present. In fact, the use of foam inhibitors should be avoided, since they act as a contaminant in the different uses to which the aluminium sulphate is put. The calcium carbonate also reduces the stability of the product.In SE,A, 8104149 3 there is described an improved method for producing sulphate poor polynucleate aluminium hydroxide complexes of the formula Al OH x S04 y H2O z n where n is an integer x is 0.75 2.0 y is 0.5 1.12 x 2y is 3 and z is 1.5 4, z being c4 when the product is in solid form and z being 4 when the product is in solution, the aluminium sulphate being admixed with one or more of the compounds from the group CaO,Ca OH 2, BaO, Ba OH 2, SrO, Sr OH 2 in aqueous solution to the reaction to form the given compound, whereafter the resultant alkali earthmetal sulphate precipitate is separated out and the residual solution optionally vapourised. The resultant solution, which can be obtained with a high basicity, OH A1 c2.0, has splendid properties, but the manufacture of the solution results in a waste, the alkali earthmetal sulphate, which is undesirable, since it constitutes up to 30 of the reaction mixture at a basicity of 2.0. A search has therefore been made for other methods which give no waste or which yield a residual product which has its own market value.Brief Description of the InventionIt has now been found possible to eliminate these technical problems and to provide in a rational and simple manner a sulphate poor, basic aluminium sulphate of the general formula FAl OH x SO4 y H2O z n where n is an integer x is 0.75 2.0 y is 0.5 1.12 x 2y is 3 z is 1.5 4, when the product is in solid form and z is 4, when the product is in the form of an aqueous solution.The method according to the invention is characterised in that a solution containing a polynucleate aluminium hydroxid sulphate complex of the formula Al m OH n 3m n in which the anion is S04 33m nn3 2 where m and n are integers and which is produced by alkalizing aluminium sulphate with an alkali from the group NaOH and Na2C03, is cooled to precipitation of Na2S04 10H20, which is separated from the solution and the residual solution is optionally concentrated or dried to a solid product by vapourization.Further characteristic features of the invention are set forth in the accompanying claims.Particularly preferred compounds are those in which x is 1.6 1.8 y is 0.5 0.7 and in solid form in which case z is 2.0 2.5.The compound exists in the form of a polynucleate complex in aqueous solution and should also exist in the same form in the solid product. The best mode of carrying out the inventionThe compound according to the invention can be produced in accordance with the following As beforementioned, the starting material from which the compound according to the invention is produced is a polynucleate aluminium hydroxid sulphate complex, the manufacture of which is described more clearly in, inter alia, SE,A, 8101830 1.According to SE,A, 8101830 1, a carbonate or hydrogen carbonate of alkali metal and an aluminium sulphate are brought to aqueous solution, the amount of aluminium sulphate being selected so that a given total aluminium content of between 0.2 and about 2 moles per litre is obtained in the solution, and the amount of carbonate or hydrogen carbonate being so selected in relation to the amount of aluminium sulphate that the ratio between the number of moles OH and the total number of moles aluminium in the resulting solution does not greatly exceed the value determined by the associated values Mole Al per litre Mole ratio OH A1 0.2 1.5 0.5 1.6 1.0 1.7 1.9 1.5 2.0 1.4Example 1Manufacture of polynucleate aluminium hydroxide and sulphate complex 67.2 grams of Na2CO3 were mixed in a dry state with 232.8 grams of granular aluminium sulphate. 700 ml av water were added to the mixture and the mixture dissolved whilst stirring with a magnetic agitator for 60 minutes during the generation of carbon dioxide, whereafter a clear solution was obtained. The solution had a volume of 824 ml with a density Q 1.18 and contained 0.90 mole of aluminium per litre, of which 68 ö existed as a polynucleate complex OH A1 1.7 . Manufacture of sulehate eoor eolynucleate aluminium tydroxide sYl2hAtecomplex The polynucleate aluminium hydroxide sulphate solution obtained in accordance with the above was cooled to OOC, whereupon 172 grams of Na2SO4.lOH2O were precipitated, this quantity corresponding to 90 of the ingoing sodium ions, and a sulphate poor polynucleate aluminium hydroxid sulphate solution with SO4 Al 0.75 was obtained.Example 2A polynucleate aluminium sulphate solution was prepared in accordance with SE,A, 7805135 6, a solution of aluminium sulphate, which was 0.2 M with respect to aluminium, was admixed with 1.5 M NaOH per mole of aluminium, to a pH of 4.5, there being obtained a polynucleate aluminium hydroxide sulphate complex in solution. This solution was then admixed with sodium citrate in an amount corresponding to 0.08 mole citrate per mole aluminium, the complex being stabilised thereby.The thus stabilised solution of polynucleate aluminium hydroxide sulphate complex was cooled to OOC, Na2SO4 x 10 H20 crystallising out in an amount corresponding to 90 of the sodium content. The residual solution comprised a sulphate poor, polynucleate aluminium hydroxide sulphate complex having an SO4 Al ratio of 0.75.Example 3A sulphate poor, polynucleate aluminium hydroxide sulphate complex was produced in accordance with example 1 above, but with the exception that 0.08 mole of sodium citrate per mole aluminium was added to the starting solution prior to crystallising out Na2S04 10 H20. The final solution contained 2.0 OH A1 and 0.5 S04 A1. The solution contained 1.5 moles aluminium per litre.Example 4A polynucleate aluminium hydroxide sulphate solution was prepared in accordance with example 1 above, the alkalizing stage being effected at a temperature of 700C over a period of one hour, the solution then being cooled to 50C for crystallising out sodium sulphate. In this way there was obtained a solution which was 7 with respect to aluminium and which had a density of 1.5. OH A1 1.6. S04 A1 0.75.The resultant sulphate poor aluminium hydroxide sulphate complexes are not stable when stored in solution from over extended periods of time, the aluminium compound present decomposing to form insoluble aluminium salts. As it is stated above, sodium citrate citric acid has a stabilising effect. Other stabilising substances are ft hydroxy carboxylic acids in addition to citric acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, glycolic acid, hydroxy succinic acid. Other stabilising substances are sodium acetate, carbonates, sugar acids and the salts thereof, such as sodium heptonate.The stabilising agent is added in an amount which at most, with respect to hydroxy carboxylic acids, corresponds to half the number of equivalents of the acid. Na heptonate is normally used in an amount corresponding to 1 2 of the solution.The aforementioned 7 solution can be diluted down to a concentration of 2 calculated as aluminium, although lower concentrations should be avoided, because this will result in excessively reduced stability, even when a stabiliser is present.As beforementioned, the 7 solution produced in accordance with the foregoing is unstable due to prevailing equilibrium conditions, a conversion to water insoluble aluminium compounds taking place. The speed at which this conversion takes place depends upon temperature, the conversion rate increasing with increasing temperature.Despite this, however, it is possible to vapourize the solution to a stable, dry solid product, which is soluble in water and which provides solutions with retained properties compared with the properties of the original solution. When the dry product is again dissolved, it is possible that the properties of the solution will be impaired, although they are fully sufficient for practical, technical use, for example, for use in a papermaking system.When vapourizing the solution, the temperature should not exceed 700C, and the vapourizing time should be restricted as far as possible, by suitable selection of a vapourizing means, such as a thin film evaporator with good air ventilation. Such an evaporator produces a brittle cake, which disintegrates into an X ray amorphous product.In order to obtain the lowest possible sulphate content, and therewith the highest possible basicity, it is preferred to work with concentrated solutions. These solutions should be at least 0.5M preferably above 1M with respect to aluminium when alkalizing and crystallizing out the product.Further, it has been found that when the aCkalizing step is carried out at elevated temperatures, at least 50 C for at least one hour, Na2SO4.10 H20 is crystallised out more rapidly, cooling to 5 1OOC being sufficient.Since solutions having polynucleate aluminium hydroxide sulphate complexes of high basicity can be readily manufactured with soda if no stabilising agent is present soda is preferred as the alkalizing agent. The solution passing to crystallization for crystallizing out Na2S04 10 H20 should have a basicity of 1.5 OH A1 1.5 at aluminium concentrations 1M in order to produce the best commercial final products. The products produced in accordance with the invention possess good properties with respect to neutralizing the charges in colloidal systems, which results in good coagulation and rapid flocculation in water pyrifying processes, and good retention in papermaking processes.Since the product is poor in sulphur, it can be used to advantage in papermaking industries, having closed white water systems, to eliminate the undesirable accumulation of sulphate ions. Excessively high quantities of sulphate ions block the desired surface chemical reactions.
