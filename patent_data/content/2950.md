# Textile materials having durable soil release and moisture transport characteristics and process for producing same.

## Abstract
Textile materials formed of polyester or nylon fibers having improved durable soil release and moisture transport characteristics are provided by application to the textile material of at least about 0.001 to about 10 weight per cent of a water soluble cellulose acetate polymeric constituent having a degree of substitution of the acetyl moiety of from about 0.6 to about 0.9, in water, and by drying the wet textile material. Such a water soluble cellulose acetate polymeric constituent is represented by the formula
