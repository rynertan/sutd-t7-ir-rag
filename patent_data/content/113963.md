# Air flow metering.

## Abstract
A single point fuel injection air fuel metering device comprising a tubular housing 12 with a flap 16 pivotally mounted therein upstream of a throttle valve 14. The flap 16 is dynamically balanced about its pivot axis 17 which is off set from the axis of the tubular housing 12, and is wholly within the bore of the tubular housing 12 throughout its range of angular movement. A flap return spring 18 which is anchored in the tubular housing 12 upstream of the flap 16 acts at the centre of area of the flap 16. A rotary damper spindle and a rotary potentiometer spindle project coaxially into the housing bore 13 from opposite sides thereof and the flap 16 is clamped to them so that it is supported by the low friction bearings of the damper and the potentiometer. An injector 23 is mounted to inject fuel into the bore 13 between the flap 16 and the throttle valve 14.
