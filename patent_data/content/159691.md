# Color image display system.

## Abstract
A color quantization system is provided for color image display, which determines a predetermined number of dis playing colors for each given frame image in the following manner A calculate a popularity or the number of pels within each sub space defined on the whole color space 12 B select the largest number M of above popularities 22 C determine the color representing the sub space which has the largest popularity, as one of the above dis playing colors, if M N nr is satisfied, wherein nr is the number of undetermined display color, and N is the number of the pels which are not mapping onto the deter mined display colors 24 D increment the size of the sub space if M This color quantization system is effective for eliminat ing the controuring effect. Furthermore, the algorithm is ve ry simple.
