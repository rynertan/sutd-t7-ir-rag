# Support for stabilizing the movement of a magnetic medium over a magnetic head.

## Abstract
A coupler for a magnetic head includes a flat circum ferential surface 18 around the aperture in which the head is mounted and a circumferential orifice surface 19 outside of and adjacent to the flat surface 18 . The orifice surface 19 forms a hydrodynamic orifice for control of flow of air over the flat circumferential surface 18 to couple the magnetic medium 11 to the magnetic head 17 by the Bernoulli effect created by movement of air between the medium and the flat circumferential surface. The coupler may protrude through a flat Bernoulli plate 12 against which the magnetic medium, e.g. a magnetic disk, is rotated.
