# FILTERING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A filter comprises a pleated fabric filter bag of generally rectangular configuration within which is removably dis posed an internal reinforcing cage of wire or rigid plastics material. The pleated fabric filter bag has an open end and a closed end and at its open end there is moulded integrally with the bag an apertured plastics end cap which has an internal configuration corresponding to the pleated fabric bag. The closed end of the bag is sealed either by the bag material or by an integrally moulded imperforate plastics end cap. The filter can be disposed vertically or horizontally within the casing of a filtering apparatus and if disposed horizontally it can be stacked in vertical array. The rectangular pleated fabric filter permits a substan tially greater area of filter fabric within a given size of filtering apparatus, casing or housing than has been possible hitherto.
