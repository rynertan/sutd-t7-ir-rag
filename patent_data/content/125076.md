## Description
GLASS FRIT COMPOSITION AND INK CONTAINING ITBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION An improved ink for use in preparing conductors in gas discharge display devices is described in copending application Serial No.443,581, filed November 22, 1982, by Nicholas W. Kay.The ink described in this application contains aluminum and operates satisfactorily however, for some applications, the ink requires a darker color, greater adherence to a glass substrate, and greater conductivity. The present invention provides an improved glass frit which can be combined with other elements including aluminum to provide an improved screenable ink having improved characteristics.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The formulation of the glass frit of the invention includes the following components with the indicated optimum weight percentages and permissible variations Permissible Optimum Variations Weight in Weight PbO 76 6 B203 15 t4 Cr203 1 0 3 Foe203 3 0.5 4 CuO 5 1.5 7 The glass frit is prepared by mixing all of the above components, heating for a suitable period of time, and then cooling to form the glass. It can then be ground to form a powder or stored in any other suitable form. The glass frit of the invention is particularly suited for use in preparing a conductive ink, such as an aluminum ink of the type used for forming reinforcing conductors around transparent anodes in a cold cathode gas discharge display device by a screening process.An ink of this type is disclosed in the above mentioned application. The glass formulation of the invention, as a constituent of an aluminum containing conductive thick film ink, makes the ink especially suited for screening conductors on a soda lime glass support plate.The glass imparts to the ink a dark, opaque color at the interface of the glass substrate and the fired coating which is desirable because it prevents light reflections. The glass also improves conductivity, and it provides optimum adhesion of the fired ink to a soda lime substrate. This glass formulation of the invention is high in lead to provide a low melting temperature, and the combination of CuO and Fe203 gives the glass completely dark and opaque color and improves conductivity of the final thick film composition. TheCr203 prevents Cu 2 reduction from the glass melt. This glass formulation does not contain inert fillers as a means of obtaining dark colors. An aluminum ink made with the glass frit of the invention includes all of the constituents disclosed in the Kay application except that the glass is replaced with the glass described above. The ink utilizes aluminum as an important component and includes nickel powder, aluminum powder, aluminum silicon alloy powder, the glass of the invention as a binder, and a vehicle. The nickel powder has an average particle size of about one micron the aluminum powder has an average size of about three microns and the aluminum silicon alloy powder has a particle size in the range of five to ten microns.One suitable aluminum silicon alloy is Valimet s H 10, which is a blackish gray, spherical material with about 88 aluminum and about 12 silicon in its composite ratio. It is a high coiiductivity metal alloy powder, and, when added to the ink formulation, it yields a dark conductive cermet. The ink has the following formulation Material Range Optimum in in Weight Weight Nickel 34 55 38 Aluminum 10 14 12 Aluminum silicon alloy 18 24 12 Lead glass frit binder 16 20 18 Vehicle 12 14 12 The vehicle includes a solvent such as alpha terpenol, ethyl cellulose and small quantities of lauric acid, triethanol amine and a wetting agent to control the flow properties of the ink. Other vehicle mixtures could be used. In using the ink formulation of the invention, it is prepared and screened on a glass plate in any desired pattern. After the screening operation, the assembly is fired in air at a temperature in the range of 5750C to 585 0C. The resultant conductor has a high conductivity of about 20 to 25 milliohms per square at a thickness of about 0.8 mil, as compared with typical aluminum and nickel resistivities in excess of 100 milliohms square. The conductor is also dark in color and non reflective so that good light contrast is achieved, and it adheres well to a support surface. It will be clear to those skilled in the art that the glass frit of the invention is not limited to the application described and that it can be used in other applications.
