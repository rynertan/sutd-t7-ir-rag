# A FILTER PLATE

## Abstract
In a plate type filter apparatus comprised of a stack of improved filter plates 22 which are separable to allow for insertion of sheet type filter media between adjacent plates and are then movable together so that an inlet chamber 50 for dirty liquid and a collection chamber 48 for clean, filtered liquid are formed on opposite sides of each filter media sheet. Each filter plate is comprised of a central planar member 42 with continuous side wall 44 and end wall members 46 around it to form upper and lower chambers that extend above and below. An elongated manifold chamber 62 attached to each opposite side wall and covers a series of side wall openings 64 into the bottom chamber 50 of the central member on one side and into its top chamber 48 from the other side wall.A series of fluid distribution members 68 for incoming dirty liquid is aligned with the side inlet openings 64 and extend to the opposite side wall. Below these trans verse distribution members the inner surface of the side and end walls is sloped outwardly 74 to increase the area of the filter media with the inlet chamber and also to prevent the accumulation of filter media cake on its inner sides.
