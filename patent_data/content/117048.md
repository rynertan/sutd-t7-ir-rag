# Production of nylon 6,6 salt.

## Abstract
This invention provides a process for producing nylon 6,6 salt which involves bioconversion of toluene to muconic acid in the presence of hexamethylenediamine to yield hexamethylenediamine muconate salt. Hydrogenation of this salt provides an aqueous solution of the desired hexamethylenediamine adipate salt.
