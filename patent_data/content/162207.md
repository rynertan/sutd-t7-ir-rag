# Testing method and tester for electrical devices.

## Abstract
A testing method and mechanism is disclosed for incor poration with the gripping fingers of a robot arm 8 , to enabie the real time testing of a device under test after it is picked up by the grippers. The robot arm has opposed fingers 62, 62 mounted thereon for transverse clamping of the sides of the device 64 under test, which can be a semiconductor module. Mounted to the robot arm is a test head 76 which can be brought into electrical contact with the pins 79 of the device under test when the device has been picked up by the arm. Test signals supplied through the test head will conduct real time testing of the device while it is being trans ported by the robot arm from the pick up point to one of several destination receptacles 38, 40 . The identity of the destination receptacle into which the tested device will be deposited, will depend upon the results of the real time test being carried out while the device is being transported.
