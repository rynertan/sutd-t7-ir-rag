# IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO SOLID STATE ANEMOMETERS AND TEMPERATURE GAUGES

## Abstract
There is disclosed a solid state temperature and or anemometer measuring instrument for a fluid medium such as atmosphere the instrument including a pair of semi conductor junction means such as zener diodes ZS, ZR one of which is exposed to fluid flow the other being isolated therefrom and providing outputs which are a function of the temperature of the fluid, and a measuring device 41 for measuring the respective outputs the differential being an indication of temperature or fluid speed. Such a device has specific applica tion in an optical air pollution monitor 42 to give a continuous indication of fluid flow thus ensuring that the monitor is sam pling fresh batches of fluid from a monitored space.
