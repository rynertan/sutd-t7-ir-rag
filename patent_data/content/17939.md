# Method for producing modified polyphenylene oxides.

## Abstract
A method for producing a modified polyphenylene oxide is described which comprises polymerizing 69 to 25 parts by weight of a mixture of 97 to 45 by weight of a styrene mono mer and 3 to 55 by weight of a polar vinyl monomer at 90 to 190 C using 0.3 to 10 parts by weight of a radical initiator in an aqueous dispersion containing a dispersion stabilizer alone or in combination with at least one of a surfactant and an adhe sion preventing agent in the presence of 31 to 75 parts by weight of a polyphenylene oxide having a unit structure of the formula,
