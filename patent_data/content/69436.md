## Description
APPARATUS FOR CONTINUOUSLY REDUCING THE WEIGHT OF FABRICS OF POLYESTER FIBERS WITH ALKALI BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an apparatus consisting of a series of devices for continuously reducing the weight of nitted and woven fabrics of polyester fibers in a spread state. Up to the present time, the weight of fabrics has been reduced with alkali using the hanged scouring method, or by using a winch, a high pressure dyeing machine or a jet dyeing machine. All such methods, however, are batchwise processes. Therefore, the hand of the products treated with alkali varied greatly, depending upon the batch, or varied greatly even in the same batch i.e., the quality of the products are extremely varied. Further, the preparation step involves complicated manual operations, Presenting serious problems in regard to the produce ability and the processing time. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The inventors of the present invention have conducted serious studies to solve the above mentioned problems, and have arrived at the present invention. According to the apparatus of the present invention for continuously reducing the weight of fabrics of polyester fibers with alkali, problems inherent in the above mentioned batchwise processes can be completely eliminated, and products having excellent and uniform qualities are produced highly efficiently. According to the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for continuously reducing the weight of fabrics of polyester fibers with alkali, which comprises, in series a padder for uniformly applying an alkali solution, that serves as a hydrolyzing agent, to the fabrics a steamer chamber, having a teJnperature of 1000C to 1250C, for promoting the. hydrolysis of fabrics impregnated with the alkali solution a machine for washing the. fabrics with water in order to remove hydrolyzed products from the fabrics and a device for drying the fabrics. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a plan view schematically illustrating an apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention and Fig. 2 is a side view schematically illustrating the apparatus of Fig. 1. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The invention will be further described below in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is a plan view schematically illustrating the apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention, and Fig. 2 is a side view showing the apparatus of Fig. 1. In the drawings, reference numeral 1 denotes a vessel, containing an alkali solution, into which fabrics are dipped, and 2 denotes nip rolls made of a rubber. The fabric to be treated is imersed in the alkali solution in the. vessel 1, and is nipped through the rolls 2 so that it is impregnated with the alkali solution at a desired pick up. A steamer chamber 3 accommodates indirect steamer pipes 4 for preventing the formation of dew on the ceiling, direct steamer pipes 5 for adjusting the temperature, and large and small feed rolls 6 for conveying the fabric when it is spread out. In the steamer chamber 3, the tempera ture can be suitably adjusted over a range of 1000C to 1250C. The fabric, which is hydrolyzed as it goes through the steamer chamber 3 and the weight of which is reduced with alkali, is then introduced into a vessel 7 containing wate.r for washing the fabric, wherein the hydrolyzed products contained in the fabric are removed in a plurality of stages by washing the. fabric with water.Feed rolls 8 and squeezing guide bars 9 are provided in the vessel 7, and holder rolls 10 are disposed on the feed rolls 8 to squeeze the fabric by nipping. The fabric, coming from the vessel 7, is then dried as it goes through an oridnary drying machine 11 made up of cylinders.
