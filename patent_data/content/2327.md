## Description
6 LOWER ALKYL 7,8 DIHYDROXY 1 PHENYL 2,3,4,5 TETRAHYDRO lH 3 BENZAZEPINES AND METHOD OF PREPARING THEM. This invention comprises a new group of dopaminergic compounds which are l phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzaze pines whose structures have at least three substituents in the benz ring of the nucleus one of which is a lower alkyl at the 6 position. DESCRIPTION OF THE ART Certain l phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzaze pines have been described in Swiss Patent No. 555,831, including certain general methods of preparation of the l phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine ring system.However this reference discloses no specific 6 lower alkyl substitution in the structures and is a broad generic disclosure. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The structures of the compounds of this invention are specifically identified by having a branched or straight lower alkyl substituent of from 1 6 carbon atoms, such as a methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isoamyl or hexyl group at the 6 position of the l phenyl tetrs enzaze pine system in addition to hydroxy or derivatized hydroxy groups at both the 7 and 8 positions. Exemplary of this new group of compounds are those represented by the following structural formula EMI2.1 in which R is lower alkyl of 1 6 carbon atoms preferably methyl or propyl Rl is hydrogen, benzyl, phenethyl, lower alkanoyl of from 1 5 carbons such as formyl, acetyl or tri fluoroacetyl, lower alkyl of 1 5 carbon atoms especially methyl, lower alkenyl of 3 5 carbon atoms such as allyl or dimethylallyl, propargyl, furylmethyl, thienylmethyl or phenacyl R2 and R3 are each hydrogen, lower alkyl of 1 5 carbon atoms especially methyl, lower alkanoyl of 2 5 carbon atoms especially acetyl, benzyl or, when taken together, methylene and R4 is hydrogen or one or two substituents such as trifluoromethyl, halo such as chloro, bromo or fluoro, methyl, methoxy, acetoxy, methylthio or especially hydroxy. R2 and R3 are preferably hydrogen for maximal dopaminergic activity. The O acyl derivatives are useful for , oral activity. For intermediate use, R2 and R3 are preferably methyl or benzyl. Prime blocking groups at position 3 are trifluoroacetyl and formyl but others such as benzyl, phenethyl, lower alkanoyl, furoyl, thenoyl or phenacyl may be used in intermediate compounds. A subgeneric group of compounds having dopaminergic activity within the above illustrative generic group are those of Formula I in which R is propyl or methyl R1 is hydrogen, allyl, ethyl or methyl R2 and R3 are the same and are hydrogen, iso butyryl or acetyl and R4 is hydrogen, hydroxy or e acetoxy. Individual compounds having exceptional dopaminergic activity are the following 7,8 dihydroxy 3,6 dimethyl 1 phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetra hydro lH 3 benzazepine 7,8 dihydroxy 6 n propyl 1 phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetra hydro lH 3 benzazepine 7,8 dihydroxy 6 methyl 1 E hydroxyphenyl 2t3,4t5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine 7,8 dihydroxy 6 n propyl l hydroxyphenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine and their nontoxic salts. The compounds in which the 7,8 dihydroxy groups are blocked by O protective groups such as the methoxy, benzyloxy or methylenedioxy containing compounds as well as the compounds having the N blocking groups mentioned are as stated above of primary interest as intermediates. The 6 methyl ani 6 propyl containing compounds are particularly active dopaminergic compounds, the former especially so with a 3 methyl substituent. The addition salts which are acceptable as nontoxic for pharmaceutical purposes or in general for synthetic ur poses but which have the utility of the corresponding free bases of Formula. I are included in this invention. These salts are prepared by methods well known to the art and .a be formed with both inorganic or organic acids, for example maleic, fumaric, benzoic, ascorbic, pamoic, succinic, bismethylenesalicyclic, methanesulfonic, ethanedisulfonic, acetic, oxalic, propionic, tartaric, salicylic, citric, gluconic, aspartic, stearic, palmitic, itaconic, glycolic, p aminobenzoic, glutamic, benzenesulfonic, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, cyclohexylsulfamic, phosphoric and nitric acids.The nontoxic hydrohalic acid salts are preferred but the methanesulfonic acid salts are useful for their stability, solubility and oral absorption. SimiLarly the quarternary salts include those prepared from organic halides such as methyl iodide, ethyl iodide, benzyl chloride and the like as known to the art. It will be obvious to one skilled in the art that the compounds of Formula It may be present as diastereoisomers which may be resolved into d and 1 optical isomers. Resolution of the optical isomers may be conveniently accomplished by fractional crystallization of their salts with optically active acids from appropriate solvents. Such methods are described in Swiss Patent No. 555,831. Unless otherwise specified herein or in the claims, it is intended to include all isomers, whether separated or mixtures thereof. Where isomers are separated, the desired pharmacological activity will usually predominate in one of the isomers. The compounds of this invention are prepared by reacting the 6 lithium intermediates which are prepared from the 6 bromo congeners with carbon dioxide to form the intermediate 6 carboxy l phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzaze pines or subsequently its ester or with a formylating agent such as N methylformanilide or another tertiary formamide to prepare the intermediate 6 formyl l phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetra hydro lH 3 benzazepines. Any chemical centers of the structures which may be,reactive under the conditions for forming a 6 metal benzazepine and reacting it with carbon dioxide or a formylating agent should be protected as known to the art such as by forming the ether derivatives of hydroxy substituents or, at reactive N hydrogen centers such as.at 3, acyl formation. The 6 carboalkoxy intermediates are reacted with a lower alkyl lithium agent to give the 6 lower alkanoyl compounds of Structure II below EMI5.1 in which R5 is lower alkyl of one less carbon atom than R of Formula I X is chloro or bromo Me is an reactive alkali metal such as sodium, potassium or lithium or magnesium halide a Grignard reagent R1 R4 are moieties as defined above for Formula I protected from the various reaction conditions as explained above and as illustrated in the examples. The 6 lower alkanoyl substituted compounds ofFormula II may be reduced directly to the 6 lower alkyl containing compounds of this invention by using conventional reducing agents such as a Clemmensen or Wolff Kischner reduction. Preferably the compounds of Formula IT are reduced to the corresponding a hydroxy lower alkyl compounds of FormulaIV using an alkali metal borohydride, trimethoxyborohydride, lithium aluminum hydride or catalytic hydrogenation such as using nickle, platinum or palladium catalysts. The 6 formyl benzazepines III are optionally reacted with a lower alkyl alkali metal such as methyl or ethyl lithium or a Grignard reagent R5Me to give the same 6 a hydroxy lower alkyl benzazepine produced from the 6 carbalkoxy intermediates. These compounds TV are converted to the desired 6 lower alkyl benzazepines of Formula I by any known chemical reduction but preferably via the 6 a haloalkyl intermediate V . The latter compounds are easily prepared by treatment of the compounds of Formula IV with concentrated mineral acid such as hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid.The halo atom is removed such as by use of an alkali metal borohydride or trimethoxyborohydride to give the end products of this invention after optional removal of protective groups such as by acid, alkali or hydrogenation treatment and then optional formation of the desired salt form. To prepare the compounds of Formula I where R1 is lower alkyl or alkenyl, phenacyl, propargyl, phenethyl, benzyl, etc., the corresponding benzazepines wherein R1 is hydrogen may be N alkylated or N acylated by standard methods with a reactive lower alkyl ester such as the bromide or chloride, a reactive alkenyl halide such as allyl bromide or chloride or, in certain cases as known to the art, by Nacylation followed by amide reduction. The latter is. used to prepare 3 furylmethyl and thienylmethyl derivatives. Advantageously, to obtain the preferred products where R2 and orR3 are hydrogen the reaction with the alkylating agent is carried out on the corresponding methoxy substituted benzazepines in an inert solvent such as methanol or acetone, preferably at reflux temperature and in the presence of a basic condensing agent such as potassium hydroxide or carbonate.Treatment of the resulting product for example, with boron tribromide or other ether splitting agents, gives the active hydroxy substituted benzazepines. Direct N alkanoylation of the dihydroxy compounds may be possible under controlled conditions as known to the art. Any undesirable O acylation may necessitate a mild hydrolysis treatment. The important compounds of Formula I where R1 is methyl are conveniently prepared from methoxy substituted benzazepines wherein R1 is hydrogen by a reductive formylation reaction with formic acid formaldehyde. Treatment of the resulting product with boron tribromide gives once again the corresponding 7,8 dihydroxy 3 methyl substituted benzazepines. To prepare the compounds of Formula I in which R2 or R3 is alkanoyl whenever there are no interfering substituents, the corresponding 3 benzyl 7,8 dihydroxy 3 benzazepine obtained by N alkylation of the hydroxy benzazepine with benzyl bromide in the presence of potassium carbonate is treated with the appropriate alkanoic acid anhydride or chloride, for example acetic anhydride, and the resulting alkanoyloxy.substituted benzazepine is then hydrogenated in the presence of palladium on carbon to remove the protective benzyl group.The dialkanoyloxy derivatives such as the important 7,8 diacetoxy compounds can also be prepared by direct O acylation of the 6 lower lakyl 7,8 dihydroxy 1 phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine hydrobromide in trifluoroacetic acid at ambient temperature with the anhydride or halide. The N or 3 lower alkanoyl congeners in the dihydroxy series may be prepared conveniently by N acylating tne methylenedioxy derivative followed by splitting the protective group. The benzazepine compounds of Formula I especially hose in which R is methyl or propyl and R1 is methyl or allyl have antiparkinsonism activity due to central dopaminergic activity as demonstrated by employing a modified standard animal pharmacological test procedure reported byUngerstedt et al., in Brain Research 24, 1970, 485 493. This activity in the compounds of Formula I which have biological activity may in certain cases be more pronounced than the peripheral or cardiovascular activity.This test procedure is based on a drug induced rotation of rats havin extensive unilateral lesions of the substantia nigra. Brie ly, the test comprises the quantitative recording of rotational behavior in rats in which 6 hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal dopamine system have been produced A unilateral brain lesion in the left substantia nigra causes the dopamine receptor in the left sudate to become hypersensitive following the resulting degMneration of the nigral cell bodies. These lesions destroy he source of I, the neurotransmitter dopamine in the caudate blF leave the caudate cell bodies and their dopamine receptor intact.Activation of these receptors by drugs which produce contralateral rotation, with respect to the lesioned side of the brain, is used as a measure of central dopamin gic activity of the drug. Compounds which are known to be clini silly effective in controlling parkinsonism, such as, for example, L dopa and apomorphine, are also effective in this rat tt fling model.These compounds directly activate the dopamin receptors and cause contralateral rotation of the lesioned .t. Rotational activity is defined as th ability of a compound to produce 500 contralateral rotate sis during a twohour period after administration, usually in raperitoneally.The dose correspond ing to 500 contralateral ovations per two hours is obtained and assigned as the RD500 glue. For example the preferred 3,6 dimethyl ,8 dihydroxy l phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine hydrobromide had an RD.OO i.p. of 0.05 mg kg RDlOOO 8.0 5.66 mg kg.6 Methyl 7,8 dihydroxy 1 phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydroulH 3 benzazepine hydrobromide is less active, RD500 0.96 mg kg. The peripheral or cardiovascular dopaminergic activity of the compounds of this invention is demonstrated using the methods of testing described in the U. S. Patent No.4,011,319. For example 6 n propyl 7,8 dihydroxy l phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine hydrobromide had anED15 i.v. of 0.57 mcg kg in the anesthetized dog compared to dopamines 2.7 mcg kg value in decreasing renal vascular resistance. The desmethyl congener had an ED15 of 3 mcg kg in the same test. 7,8 Dihydroxy 6 methyl l p hydroxy phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine hydrobromide has an ED15 i.v. of 2.8 mcg kg but has a high biological selectivity factor. Certain other 6 lower alkyl congeners of this series of this invention had relatively lower peripheral dopaminergic activity such as the 6 methyl or 6 ethyl congeners. Also a number of the series may have substantial cen tral and diminished peripheral dopaminergic activity or vice versa.This may be due more to the distribution of the compound to the active sites of action rather than lack of inherant dopaminergic activity. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention containing a compound of Formula I which has dopaminergic activity are prepared in conventional dosage unit forms by incorporating the chemical compound or a pharmaceutically carrier according to accepted procedures in a nontoxic amount sufficient to produce the desired pharmacodynamic activity in a subject, animal or human. Preferably the compositions will contain the active ingredient in an active but nontoxic amount selected from about 50 mg to about 1000 mg of active ingredient per dosage unit but this quantity depends on the specific type and potency of biological activity possessed by tre individual compounds as well as the conditions of patient and route of administration. The pharmaceutical carrier employed may be, for .sam ple, either a solid or liquid. Exemplary of solid carriers are lactose, terra alba, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and the like. Exemplary of liquid carriers are syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, water and the like. Similarly the carrier or diluent may include any time delay material well known to the art, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax. A side variety of pharmaceutical forms can be employed. Thus, if a solid carrier for oral administration is used the preparation can be tableted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form, or in the form of a trouche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier will vary widely but preferably will be from about 25 mg to about 1 g.If a liquid carrier is used, the preparation will be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile injectable liquid such as an ampul, or an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid suspension. The pharmaceutical preparations are made following the conventional techniques of the pharmaceutical chemist involving mixing, granulating and compressing when necessary, or variously mixing and dissolving the ingredients as appropriate to give the desired end product. The method of producing dopaminergic activity in accordance with this invention comprises administering internally to a subject in need of such activity a compound ofFormula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, usually combined with a pharmaceutical carrier, in a nontoxic amount sufficient to produce said activity as described above. The route of administration may be any route which effectively transports the active compound to the dopamine receptors which are to be stimulated such as orally or parenterally, the oral route being preferred. Advantageously,. equal doses will be administered several times such as two or three times a day with the daily dosage regimen being selected from about 100 mg to about 2 g.When the method described above is carried out antiparkinsonism and or hypoten sive activity is produced with a minimum of side effects. The terms lower alkyl , lower alkoxy , lower alkanoyl and such alone or combined are used to mean chemically stable straight or branched aliphatic groups having up to 6 carbon atoms unless otherwise noted. The following examples are designed solely to illustrate the preparation and use of the compounds of this invention. The temperatures are Centigrade. Other variations of these examples will be obvious to those skilled in the art. EXAMPLE 1 A. 7,8 Dimethoxy l phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro ls 3 benzazepine 280 g, 0.75 mole was dissolved in 1700 ml of. acetic acid. Bromine 280 g, 1.75 mole was added in a thin stream. This reaction was stirred for two hours. The precipitate, which formed after 1 hour, was collected and washed with ether. It was dissolved in boiling methanol and acetone was added to destroy the bromine excess. 6 Bromo 7,8 di methOxy l phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 1z 3 benzazepine hydrobromide was allowed to crystallize from the methanol and a second crop was obtained by adding ether to the mother liquor. Yield 298 g, 77 m.p. 236 2380. This bromination may be applied to any suitably 0 and N protected 7,8 dialkoxy or alkanoyloxybenzazepine having a free 6 position in which the substituted l phenyl ring is not more reactive to halogenation than is the 6 position of the nucleus. B. Isovanillin 76.1 g, 0.5 m was suspended in 750 ml of chloroform. Bromine 27.3 ml, 0.5 m in 200 ml of chloroform was added at Oo slowly.

The reaction was stirred for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted into methylene chloride to give the benzyl alcohol m.p. 74 76.5 . This was converted to the benzyl chloride as a an liquid, using benzene and conc. hydrochloric acid then to the benzyl cyanide, m.p. 48 550 using sodium cyanide in dimethylsulfoxide. The benzyl cyanide 8.05 g, 0.315 mole was dissolved in 80n ml of dry tetrahydrofuran and then added slowly to 80 ml of 1 M diborane in tetrahydrofuran atAfter refluxing for 2 hours, the mixture was cooled and 40 ml of methanol added carefully. After refluxing shortly and standing overnight the mixture was concentrated to give a tan oil. Dilute hydrochloric acid was added. The material was washed with ether, filtered and the filtrate made basic with 40 sodium hydroxide. After extracting with ether, washing, drying and evaporated the extracts the desired phenethylamine was obtained as a viscous, light yellow oil. The phenethylamine 0.12 mole is heated to 1150 in an oil bath. Styrene oxide 14.4 g 0.12 mole is added and the reaction heated for 1 hour. After cooling to N300, 2 1 petroleum ether acetone is added to give N 2 hydroxy 2 phenylethyl N 2 2 bromo 3 4 dimethoxyphenyl ethyl amine.

The ether is dried and evaporated to give 6 bromo 7,8 dimethOxy 1 phenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro lH 3 benzazepine. Using this general procedure with variously substituted styrene oxides having one or more methyl, methoxy, methylthio, trifluoromethyl groups gives the corresponding 6 bromo intermediates not readily prepared by direct bromination which are used for preparing the 6 alkyl derived compounds of thins invention by the methods described hereafter. The 6 bromo 7,8 dimethoxy compound 100 g in a large excess of ethyl formate is heated at reflux for 10 hours.
