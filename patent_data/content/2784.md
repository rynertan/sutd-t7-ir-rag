# Variable air flow oven.

## Abstract
A variable air flow oven 10 is disclosed in which a variable air directing control means 70 delivers varying amounts of heated air under various positive pressures in an alternating pattern to jet orifices 60 in opposite side walls 54 of the oven in an inverse ratio. Hot air jets from opposite sides of the oven meet at points of common velocity in the processing chamber to produce a turbulent mixing of the hot air in a vertical plane. The turbulent heated air travels from one side of the oven to the other ad a controlled rate under the controlled operation of a motor 72 driven mechanical linkage arrangement 92 to assure even baking, cooking or drying of the products being processed through the entire processing chamber in the oven. The system operates at a positive pressure at all times, so that the main supply of heated air flows through one side duct and a smaller volume of heated air flows through the opposite side. As the air pressure is varied to the hot air jets in the opposite side walls, the vertical plane of turbulent heated air sweeps back and forth through the chamber, contacting the entire product, and then is drawn into a return duct 64 for reheating and recirculation.
