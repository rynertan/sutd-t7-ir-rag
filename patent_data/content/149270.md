# Reflection grating.

## Abstract
A planar reflection grating is described which is suitable for use in an optical multiplexer or demultiplexer. This grating comprises a periodic structure of elongate areas which are formed at constant distances from each other in a thin light conducting layer deposited on a substrate. In their longitudinal directions the areas have periodic excursions, corresponding portions of the areas extending parallel to each other.
