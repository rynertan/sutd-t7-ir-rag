# Heat cooking apparatus.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a heat cooking apparatus so arranged to install a flat heater at an outside surface of the wall surface of heating chamber for accommodating food material, which is firmly attached with a flat heater com posed of flatly configured heating elements with a heat proof insulator therebetween. Also, by forming a non metallic layer on the inner surface of the metallic wall surface facing the heating elements, heat from the heater is efficiently and uniformly conducted so as to perform uniform heating and high heat cooking efficiency.
