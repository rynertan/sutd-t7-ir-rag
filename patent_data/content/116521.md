# HIGH YIELDING SOLAR MODULUS FOR THE TRANSFORMATION, ON PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS, OF A SUBSTANTIALLY MONOCHROMATIC RADIATION IN ELECTRIC ENERGY

## Abstract
The above mentioned invention regards a solar modulus 1 of common type photovoltaic cells, connected with usual means 3 of concentration on it of solar radiation. And this so as to allow the nearly total exploitation of incident radiation through the recovery and consevation in its internal parts of the reflected radiation and the transformation of solar energy. And also of the heat dissipated in it, in the emission, by thermic effect, of a disc 8 of material which has a high thermic conductibility a high absorption of solar radiation and a high fusion point. This emission by thermic effect, is directed to a panel 10 made of one or more photovoltaic cells through a semitransparent filter 9 of selection of the radiation at the characteristic values of activation of the photovoltaic cells.
