# Preparation of water dispersible, modified polyurethanes.

## Abstract
A water dispersible, modified polyurethane which resists microbial attack, exhibits superior efficiency in thickening aqueous compositions and imparts improved leveling, is the reaction product of a a polyisocyanate b from 0.10 to 10.00 moles per mole of polyisocyanate of a polyether polyol c from 0.015 to 3.400 moles per mole of polyisocyan ate, of a modifying agent having the formula X
