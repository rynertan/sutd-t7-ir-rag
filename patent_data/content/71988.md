# Apparatus for automatically measuring and controlling chemical reaction amount.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to a reaction amount meas urement controlling apparatus capable of measuring the reaction amount with high accuracy and controlling the reaction amount. The apparatus comprises at least one temperature detector disposed in the interior, the outer surface of the reaction system or in a vessel, a com puter having an operation function for calculating the reaction amount in accordance with the temperature signal of the temperature detector, and a comparison function for generating an output signal to terminate reaction when the reaction amount is equal to the preset amount or exceeds the preset amount, a timer for getting the operation and comparison performed at given inter vals.
