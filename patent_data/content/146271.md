Compounds of formula I may be prepared according to the following Reaction Scheme I Reaction Scheme I EMI8.1 Three primary stages are used in the preparation of compounds of the formula I by starting zxith arylalkanoic acids or arylalkanones of the formula II wherein Z is OU or R3, e.g., hydrogen, alkvl or alkoxyalkyl. The stages are halogenation, construction of an amine functionality and condensation with an Ari acetylene. In the halogenation stage A, wherein X is a halogen such as Br or I, the aryl ring of II is halogenated in the position ortho to the eventual aminoalkyl side chain.Brominations may be carried out with bromine in halocarbon solvents or acetic acid at temperatures from about 20 to 80C and may be conducted in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst such as ferric chloride. Iodinations may he carried out usingIC1 or INO3 in halocarbon solvents or acetic acid over a range of room temperature to about lOO0C. Iodinations nay be carried out using iodine in the presence of an iodide scavenger such as silver acetate, silver sulfate, mercuric oxide or nitric acid. For reactive substrates, iodine may be used alone or in conjunction with a mild base such as sodium bicarbonate.Alternatively, the halogenation may be accomplished by mercuration, e.g., with HgCl2 or thallation, e.g., with T1 02CCF3 3, followed by treatment with iodide or bromide as described by A. McRillop, et al.in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 93, 4841 1971 .In stage n or r3V the desired amine function is constructed. In a first embodiment for Stage B and if R3 is to be hydrogen, a compound of formula III wherein Z isOH may be converted to the corresponding acid chloride by reagents such as oxalyl chloride, thionyl chloride or phosphoryl chloride. The reaction may be carried out at roo n temperature to about 100 CC in an aprotic, nonpolar solvent such as toluene, chloroform or methylene chloride or the reaction may be carried out neat. The preferred method employs oxalvl chloride in toluene in the presence of DMF. The acid chloride is converted to the corresponding amide of formula III wherein Z is NRÚ Alk Rê qAr2. This conversion may be carried out by treatment of the acid chloride with an excess of amine of the formula RlNH Alk 92 q Ar2, for instance in toluene or a halocarbon solvent at temperatures from 3O0C to 450C. Alternatively, slightly more than one equivalent of amine may be used in the presence of an auxillary base such as triethylamine, pyridine, sodium hydroxide or potassium carbonate. The amide is then reduced to the corresponding amine of the formula IV wherein R3 is hydrogen to complete elaboration of the amine function. The reduction of the amide is preferably carried out with an excess of borane in THF at the reflux temperature of the solvent.The excess borane is decomposed by addition of water and the amine borane complex is decomposed by heating in the presence of an alkanoic acid, preferably propionic acid, a mineral acid or an alkali metal hydroxide to give the amine of formula I5l wherein R3 is hydrogen. Alternatively, the amide may be reduced with lithium aluminum hydride, sodium borohydride plus aluminum chloride or sodium borohydride in acetic or trifluoroacetic acid. x second embodiment for the construction of the amine function consists of reductive alkylation of amines of the formula P1NH Alk R2 q Ar2 by aldehydes or ketones of the formulae III or V wherein Z is R3, i.e., hydrogen, alkyl or alkoxyalkyl.The reductive alkylation may be carried out in one step from the carbonyl compound and the amine using sodium cyanoborohydride as the reducing agent in a lower alkanol or acetonitrile as the solvent at neutral to mildly acidic pH at temperatures from 0 to 400C. Hydrogenation over a noble metal catalyst may also be used to bring about the reduction. Reductive alkylation may also be carried out in two steps. The carbonyl compound and amine are first converted to an imine or iminium salt by treatment with molecular sieves or azeotropic removal of water. Reduction is then effected by NaflH4,NaCNBH3 or catalytic reduction. Using the two step reductive alkylation, the alkyl groups RÚ and Alk R2 q Ar2 may be attached sequentially.In stage B , the reductive alkylation cannot be carried out by catalytic hydrogenation in view of the possibility of hydrogenation of the acetylene moiety.If P1 is to be methyl, the Eschweiler Clark procedure using formaldehyde as the carbonyl compound and formic acid or sodium cyanoborohydride as the reducing agent is used.The third stage in Reaction Scheme I is the replacement of halide X by an Arl acetylene and is labeled C and C. For stage C, the transformation may be carried out by heating the aryl halide I5J with a cuprous Arl acetylide at the reflux temperature of the solvent, preferably pyridine orDMF as described by R. D. Stephens, et al. inJ. Org. Chem., 2S, 3313 1963 . Secondly, the coupling of the arylhalides III or IV with an ArÚ acetylene may be accomplished by treating the arylhalide with chlorozinc Arl acetylide in the presence of a palladium or nickel catalyst, preferably Pd h3 P 4 in an etherial solvent such as THF at 300C to ambient temperature, as described by A. O. King et al. in J. Org. Chem., 43, 358 1978 .Thirdly, coupling may be by treating the arylhalide III or IV with the Arl acetylene and catalytic quantities, e.g., 0.5 to. 10 mole percent, of Pd Ph3 P 4,Pd OAc 2 P Ph 3 2 or PdCl2 P Ph 3 2 in an amine solvent such as diethylamine, piperidine, pvrrolidine or triethylamine at ambient temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent in the presence or absence of cuprous iodide as described by F. Sonogashira et al. in TetrahedronLetters, 4457 1975 or H.A. Dieck et al. inJ. Organometal. Chem. 93, 253 1975 . When Ri is to be hydrogen, the method of Stephens et al. may not be used.The stages of reaction Scheme I may be carried out in the sequence A, n and C or the sequence A, C and B . When R1 is to be alkyl, such may be attached hy reductive alkylation after carrying out stage C or B .A second general method for preparation of compounds of formula I where n is 0, R4 is H and R3 is alkyl is shown in Reaction Scheme II Reaction Scheme IIEMI12.1 An aromatic aldehyde VI is condensed with a nitroalkane of the formula R3CH2NO2 to afford a nitroolefin VII . Condensation of the nitroalkane with the aromatic aldehyde is carried out using ammonium acetate or a primary alkylamine as catalyst in, for example, glacial acetic acid, ethanol or toluene as the solvent at ambient to elevated temperatures preferably at the reflux temperature of the solvent. The nitroolefin VII is then reduced to an amine VIII where This hydrogen with lithium aluminum hydride in an ether solvent, or by catalytic reduction over Raney nickel or a noble metal catalyst. The anine VIII is halogenated on the aromatic ring using the methods described for Stage A to afford a halogenated amine of the formula VIII where R5 is halo.The haloamine is coupled with an Arl acetylene using the procedure of King et al. or Sonogashiri et al. as described forStage C to give an acetylene of formula VIII where R5 is C C ArÚ. Attachment of the groups Alk R2 q Ar2 and or P1 by reductive alkylation starting with the appropriate carbonyl compounds, e.g., CH3CHO to have ethyl as the RI moiety or benzaldehyde to give benzyl as the Alk P2 q Ar2 moiety, affords the product of the formula I wherein n is o, R4 is hydrogen and R3 is alkyl. Starting materials for Reaction Schemes I and II are widely known. However, starting materials with particular substituents may be synthesized by the following methods First, alkanones of the formula II wherein Z is R3, n is O and R4 is hydrogen may be prepared by condensation of an aromatic aldehyde VI with an alpha haloester, e.g. of the formula R CHBrCOOAlkyl in the presence of an alkali metal alkoxide to give a glycidic ester of the formula Hydrolysis with an alkali metal hydroxide followed by thermal decarboxylation affords the arylalkanone It wherein Z is R3 w n is n and R4 is hydrogen.Conversion of such a II compound to one wherein R4 is alkyl may be carried out by alkylation of an alkali metal enolate of the carbonyl compound II with a reagent such as ethyl iodide. Second, arylalkanones of the formula II where Z is R3, n is 1 and R4 is hydrogen may be prepared by a ClaisenSchmidt condensation of a methyl ketone, CH3COR3 with an aromatic aldehyde VI in the presence of an alkali metal hydroxide followed by hydrogenation of the alpha,betaunsaturated ketone X over a noble metal catalyst.Third, arylalkanoic acids of the formula II wherein Z isOH, R4 is hydrogen and n is I may be prepared byKnoevenagel condensation of an aromatic aldehyde VI with malonic acid followed by hydrogenation of the resulting cinnamic acid XI over a noble metal catalyst EMI14.1 In each of the above three sequences, the aromatic aldehyde may be one with an X group ortho to the CHO and such a starting material will result in final products of the formula III after the steps described above.For the preparation of intermediates II and III whereY is halo, alkylthio, hydroxy, cyano or dialkylamino, the corresponding compounds XII where p is 0 or 1, respectively, may be utilized as starting materials. The amine XII may be diazotized to give XIII and the diazonium group may he treated with Curl, CuBr or CuCN to yield II or III wherein Y is Cl, Br or CN, respectively. Pyrolysis of the diazonium fluoroborate or hexafluoro phosphate gives the corresponding aryl fluoride. Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt would lead to the corresponding phenol.Treatment of the diazonium salt successively with potassium ethyl xanthate, base and an alkyl halide leads to the alkylthio product. Reductive alkylation of the amino compound XII with formaldehyde or an alkanal and sodium cyanoborohvdride gives rise to intermediates II or III bearing the dialkylaminoEMI14.2 The various Y groups in compounds such as those of formulae IT , III , IV and XII may be transformed among each other by techniques known in the art. For example, when Y is amino, the corresponding compound wherein Y is monoalkylamino may be prepared by acylation with an acyl halide or anhydride to yield the corresponding compound where Y is alkanoylamino followed by hydride reduction with borane or lithium aluminum hydride.When Y is alkylthio the corresponding compound where Y is alkylsulfinyl or alkylsulfonyl may be produced by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide or a peracid such as trifluoroperacetic acid known in the art. Variation in the reaction temperature, reaction time and reactivity of the substrate and particular reagent will all be factors influencing whether the product is the sulfinyl or sulfonyl and manipulation of such variables is well known in the art. then Y is alkoxy, the corresponding compound wherein Y is hydroxv may be produced by conventional dealkylating reagents such as boron tribromide, boron trichloride, trimetnylsilyliodide and hydrogen iodide.In addition, compounds wherein v is alkoxy may be produced from the phenol by alkylation with a reagent such as alkyl halide, e.g., methyl iodide, in the presence of a base.Arl acetylenes as required may be prepared by the method of Ames et al as described in Synthesis, 364 1981 .Treatment of Arl iodides of the formula Arl I with PdC12 Ph 3P 2 or Pd OAc 2 Ph 3P 2 and 2 methyl 3 butyn2 ol affords acetylenic carbinols XI5Z . Cleaveage of the carbinol XIV with an alkali metal hydroxide gives rise to the Arl acetylenes. The Arl acetylenes may be converte.1 to cuprous Arl acetylides by treatment with cuprous iodide in ammonium hydroxide solution. EMI16.1 Compounds of the formula I , including the acid addition salts and quaternary compounds thereof, are calcium blockers and as such, are effective against angina, hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias in mammals, particularly as described by S.F. Flaim et al. in Calcium nlockers Mechanisms of Action and Clinical Applications , Urban andSchwarzenberg, Baltimore, Md. 1982 . Techniques used to determine efficacy as a calciium blocker are described byS.F. Flaim et al. in Pharmacology, Vol. 22, p. 286 to 293 1981 .Compounds of the invention have the advantage of a significant separation between the desirable coronary vasodilator effects and the less desirable side effect of decreased myocardial contractile force.The activity of compounds of formula I for the treatment of hypertension was determined using the SpontaneouslvHypertensive Rat sir test as described below.In this test, the arterial pressure of adult spontaneously hypertensive rats Charles River is monitored directly via an aortic cannula. The SH rats are anesthetized with an inhalation anesthetic ether . The left carotid artery is isolated and cannulated. The tip of the cannula is advanced to the aorta and the cannula is exteriorized behind the neck at the level of the scapula.
