Verfahren zur Herstellung eines Disaccharidderivats der Formel I

## Description
This invention relates to a process for preparing disaccharide derivatives represented by the formula I wherein R¹CO and R²CO each represents a residue of a straight chain fatty acid having from 8 to 20 carbon atoms and having a hydroxyl group at the 3 position thereof R³CO and R⁴CO each represents a residue of a straight chain fatty acid having from 8 to 20 carbon atoms and m and n each represents an integer of from 8 to 12, It is known that endotoxin which is an outer membrane component of various Gram negative bacilli has various biological activities, such as enhancement of immune function of an animal. The main active portion of the endotoxin is considered to reside in a disaccharide moiety which is one of units constituting lipopolysaccharide, and establishment or presumption of structures of disaccharide moiety of various Gram negative bacilli has been studied. For example, the structure of the disaccharide moiety of In parallel to these studies, various disaccharide derivatives having structures similar to the established or presumed structures of the natural disaccharide compounds hereinafter referred to as natural lipid A have been synthesized, and their biological activities, such as immunological activity, have been examined. However, any of these synthetic disaccharide derivatives hereinafter referred to as synthetic lipid A lacks biological activities or has, if any, far less activity as compared with natural lipid A extracted from The above described differences between the natural lipid A and the synthetic lipid A on biological activities are believed to arise from differences of fatty acid residues bonded to the 2 amino group and 3 hydroxyl group of a non reducing end of glucosamine. More specifically, in the known synthetic lipid A, a straight chain fatty acid residue or a straight chain fatty acid residue having a hydroxyl group at the 3 position is bonded to the 2 amino group and the 3 hydroxyl group of the non reducing end of glucosamine. Whereas, in the natural lipid A, it is presumed that a straight chain fatty acid residue having a hydroxyl group at the 3 position is bonded to the 2 amino group and the 3 hydroxyl group, and the fatty acid moiety has a straight chain fatty acid residue bonded to the 3 hydroxyl group thereof through an ester linkage. Lipid A extracted from Based on the above described presumption, the present inventor has synthesized compounds represented by the formula I that can be regarded to have the closest chemical structure to that of natural lipid A and completed this invention. Natural lipid A exhibits a mitogenic activity, i.e., an activity to stimulate lymphocytes to promote production of neolymphocytes and enhancing immune function, a tumor necrosis factor TNF inducing activity, and the like. Therefore, the compounds of this invention are useful for prophylaxis and treatment of many diseases caused by reduced immune function, for example, as preventing and treating agents for various infectious diseases, various cancer, etc. Since the compounds obtained according to the present invention are considered to have a chemical structure similar to that of natural lipid A as described above, it is reasonable that they possess biological activities equal or superior to those of natural lipid A. Further, as being single pure compounds, they are possibly free from various disadvantages associated with natural lipid A. The utilities of the compounds of the present invention as pharmaceutical agents have been confirmed by the mitogenicity and the TNF inducing activity, as described hereinafter in Test Examples 1 and 2. Also, the compounds of this invention are very useful as a standard reagent for determination of endotoxin in the samples to be tested, and their activity has been confirmed by the local Shwartzman reaction test Test I in Test Example 3 , the pyrogenicity test Test II in Test Example 3 , and the activation of clotting enzyme of The local Shwartzman reaction test Test I is examined to determine the phenomenon of necrosis, at the site where a test compound was injected, induced by intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide hereinafter referred to as LPS after 20 hours from intracutaneous injection of the test compound to test animals, preferably in rabbits. When the test compound shows a positive reaction necrosis in this test, it can be considered to have the endotoxin specific activity. LPS and natural lipid A which have been conventionally used as standard reagents for determination of endotoxin exhibit positive reactions in this test. Tests II and III have been used for determining endotoxin in the samples to be tested. As described hereinafter in detail in Test Examples 1 to 3, a known synthetic lipid A exhibits negative reactions in Tests I and II and thus does not satisfy the requirements for standard reagent for determination of endotoxin, whereas natural lipid A and LPS exhibit positive reactions in these tests. Accordingly, the positive reaction shown by the compounds of this invention in Tests I to III proves that these compounds are useful as standard reagents for determination of endotoxin. Further, the conventional standard reagents for determination of endotoxin are natural products extracted from bacteria and are not always uniform in their purity and activity, whereas the compounds of the present invention do not have such disadvantages since these compounds can be synthetically prepared as a product having a constant activity. The compounds represented by the formula I of the present invention are prepared according to the following reaction route involving Steps A to E wherein TCEC represents a trichloroethoxycarbonyl group Allyl represents an allyl group Ac represents an acetyl group Bzl represents a benzyl group Alkyl¹ and Alkyl² each represents an alkyl group having from 5 to 17 carbon atoms R⁵ is a suitable protecting group, preferably a benzyloxymethyl group and R³CO , R⁴CO , m and n are as defined above. Step A comprises condensating a compound represented by the formula II with a compound represented by the formula III to obtain a compound represented by the formula IV . Step B comprises removing TCEC groups bonded to the 2 amino group and the 6 hydroxyl group of the compound IV and, at the same time, bonding a group represented by the formula VI wherein R³CO and n are as defined above, Step C comprises protecting the 6 hydroxyl group of the resulting compound with, for example, a benzyloxymethyl group. Step D comprises removing the protecting allyl group at the 1 hydroxyl group to obtain the compound represented by the formula V . Finally, Step E comprises reacting the compound V with dibenzyl phosphorochloridate to introduce a phosphono group into the 1 hydroxyl group and then removing all the protecting groups for functional groups by catalytic reduction to obtain the desired compound of the present invention. Reaction conditions for Steps A to E are generally as follows. The compound represented by the formula II is dissolved in an inert solvent, such as anhydrous methylene chloride, and the O acetyl group is replaced with a bromine atom by treating the solution with dry hydrogen bromide gas under ice cooling. After the solvent is removed, the resulting compound is dissolved in an anhydrous reaction solvent, e.g., methylene chloride, chloroform, etc., and condensed with the compound of the formula III in the presence of mercury II cyanide, silver carbonate or silver oxide, preferably mercury II cyanide, and in the presence of a dehydrating agent, e.g., anhydrous calcium sulfate, under heating at about 70 C for about 24 to 38 hours. The reaction mixture is treated with a 5 potassium iodide aqueous solution and then purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain the disaccharide compound IV . The disaccharide compound IV is dissolved in acetic acid, and a zinc powder is added to the solution, followed by allowing the mixture to react at room temperature for several tens minutes, preferably 30 minutes, to remove the protecting group at the 2 amino group. Then, the resulting product is acylated with a desired fatty acid, e.g., R 3 dodecanoyloxytetradecanoic acid, in the presence of a condensing agent commonly employed for peptide synthesis, e.g., dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, etc., and preferably in the presence of a base, e.g., ethylisopropylamine, 4 dimethylaminopyridine, etc., and the product is purified by silica gel column chromatography. The compound obtained in Step B is dissolved in anhydrous chloroform or anhydrous methylene chloride, preferably the latter, and benzyloxymethyl chloride and a base, e.g., pyridine, ethyldiisopropylamine, etc., are added to the solution at room temperature to react for about 48 hours. Purification by silica gel column chromatography gives a compound of which 6 hydroxyl group is protected with a benzyloxymethyl group. The compound obtained in Step C is dissolved in tetrahydrofuran, and an iridium complex such as Ir COD PCH₃ C₆H₅ ₂ ₂PF₆ wherein COD represents cyclooctadiene is added thereto. The mixture is allowed to react at about 45 C for several tens minutes, preferably 40 minutes. Water and iodine are added to the reaction mixture at room temperature, and the reaction is continued for several minutes, preferably about 10 minutes. Purification of the reaction product by silica gel column chromatography gives the compound V . The compound V is dissolved in an anhydrous aprotic solvent, e.g., anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, and a 10 w v butyl lithium solution in hexane is added thereto at 70 C. After about 5 minutes, benzyl phosphorochloridate is added to the reaction mixture, followed by continuing the reaction for about several tens minutes, preferably about 20 minutes. The reaction mixture is then subjected to catalytic reduction to remove all the protecting groups for functional groups. The reaction product is purified by silica gel column chromatography and then desalted by electrodialysis to obtain the desired compound I of this invention.

The present invention will now be illustrated in greater detail with reference to the following Reference Examples and Example, but it should be understood that the present invention is not limited thereto. In these examples, all percents and ratios are by weight unless otherwise indicated. The activities of the compounds of this invention are hereinafter described in detail with reference to Test Examples. Test compounds used in these test examples are as follows 6 O 2 Deoxy 2 R 3 dodecanoyloxytetradecanoylamino 3 O R 3 tetradecanoyloxytetradecanoyl 4 O phosphono β D glucopyranosyl 2 deoxy 2 R 3 hydroxytetradecanoylamino 3 O R 3 hydroxytetradecanoyl 1 O phosphono α D glucopyranose 6 O 2 Deoxy 2 R 3 hydroxytetradecanoylamino 3 O R 3 hydroxytetradecanoyl 4 O phosphono β D glucopyranosyl 2 deoxy 2 R 3 hydroxytetradecanoylamino 3 O R 3 hydroxytetradecanoyl 1 O phosphono α D glucopyranose Lipid A extracted from LPS extracted from The mitogenicity of the compounds of this invention was determined in terms of stimulation of ³H labeled thymidine uptake into, for example, isolated murine lymphocytes splenocytes . Spleen of BALB c nu nu mice male 8 week old was minced, and lymphocytes collected from the minced spleen were incubated with graded doses of test compounds in RPMI 1640 medium without fetal bovine serum at 37 C at a concentration of 1 x 10⁵ to 1 x 10⁶ lymphocytes per mℓ for 48 hours. Twenty four hours before the completion of the incubation, ³H labeled thymidine manufactured by New England Nuclear was added to the culture. After the completion of the incubation, cells were collected on glass micro fiber paper and dried, and the radioactivity of ³H labeled thymidine incorporated into the cells was measured. The ratio of thymidine uptake in the test culture to which the test compound had been added to that in the respective control culture was determined as a stimulation index. The higher the stimulation index, the higher the mitogenicity. The results obtained are shown in Table 1. The TNF inducing activity of the compounds of this invention was determined by administering the test compound to BCG primed mice and measuring cytostatic and cytocidal actions of test sera from the mice on L 929 cells originated in mice fibroblast . That is, ICR mice female 5 week old were primed by intravenous inoculation of 1.3 X 10⁸ viable units of BCG vaccine Japan BCG Laboratory, Tokyo per mouse, and, 2 weeks after the priming, 10 µg of the test compound was administered intravenously to each mouse. Ninety minutes later, blood samples were obtained and sera were prepared. On the other hand, each well of a 96 well microculture plate manufactured by Corning Glass Works was filled with 90 µℓ containing 3 X 10⁴ cells of a suspension of L 929 cells, grown and suspended in Eagle s minimal essential medium MEM supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum manufactured by Flow Laboratories Inc., Va. , 100 U mℓ of penicillin, 100 µg mℓ of streptomycin and 2 Meylon manufactured by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Tokushima, Japan . Two hours later, 100 µℓ of the above prepared serum samples which had been serially diluted 5 folds with the above described medium and then ³H labeled thymidine were added to each well. After incubation for 48 hours at 37 C, cells were collected by centrifugation, and radioactivity of ³H labeled thymidine incorporated into the cells was determined. A reciprocal of the final dilution of the test serum that resulted in 50 inhibition of ³H labeled thymidine uptake of L 929 cells was calculated by the Kärber method and referred to as TNF inducing activity ED₅₀ . The results obtained are shown in Table 2 below. The test on Shwartzman reaction specific to endotoxin was carried out as follows using Japanese white rabbits female, weighing around 3 kg . That is, Japanese domestic white rabbits were intracutaneously injected with the test compound. Twenty hours later, 100 µg of LPS extracted from The pyrogenicity of the compounds of this invention was determined in terms of body temperature increase in rabbits after intravenous injection of the test compound in accordance with the test method of pyrogenicity defined in Japanese Pharmacopoeia. That is, the rectal temperatures of Japanese domestic white rabbits body weight 2 to 2.5 kg were measured 3 times at one hour intervals. When the temperature in the second and third measurements were substantially equal, the third temperature was taken as a reference temperature. Within 15 minutes after the third measurement, the test compound dissolved in pyrogen free distilled water was injected in the ear vein, and the rectal temperature was measured 3 times at one hour intervals after injection. A difference between the reference temperature and the maximum temperature was taken as an increase of body temperature, and the pyrogenicity of the test compound was expressed by the number of febrile animals showing a temperature increase of 0.6 C or more. The results obtained are shown in Table 4. The pyrogenicity of the compounds of this invention was also determined by Limulus test toxicolor test . That is, the test compound was dissolved in a pyrogen free 0.1 vol vol triethylamine aqueous solution to a concentration of 2 mg mℓ and diluted with pyrogen free distilled water to a concentration of 4 X 10 ¹ mg mℓ. Subsequently, dilute aqueous solutions having concentrations of from 4 X 10 ¹ mg mℓ to 4 10 ¹⁰ mg mℓ were prepared by serial 10 fold dilution. 0.1 mℓ of a mixture of 0.1 mℓ of each dilute aqueous solution, a lyophilized amoebocyte lysate of The compounds of this invention will normally be administered as a pharmaceutical composition comprising as active ingredient at least one such compound or a salt thereof, optionally together with a pharmaceutical carrier and or adjuvant.
