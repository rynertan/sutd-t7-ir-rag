# Display apparatus.

## Abstract
A display panel has a pair of opposed electrode substrates. One of the electrode substrates has a plurality of individual electrodes 3a 3g each having two regions opposed to segment a g and background areas, respectively. The other electrode substrate has a plurality of common electrodes 3 I, 3 II each having two regions opposed to segment and background areas, respectively. Each segment region of the common electrodes is arrayed so as to oppose the segment region of a predetermined individual electrode, while each background region of the common electrode is arrayed so as not to oppose the background region of the above predetermined individual electrode. The segment region of each electrode is defined by those two sections of the outline opposed electrodes which encircle the overlapping parts of the two opposed electrodes.
