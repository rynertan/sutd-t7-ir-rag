# GEL ELECTRODE FOR EARLY DETECTION OF METAL FATIGUE

## Abstract
Early fatigue damage in aluminium can be assessed by the detection of microcracks in an anodized surface film 30 using a hand held electrode 10 having a contact tip 20 formed of a gel 16 containing an iodide salt and starch. The gel tip 20 is pressed against the anodized film 30 and an electrical pulse is applied to pass current through the mi crocracks to oxidize iodide in the gel 16 to form black iodine starch complex. Thus, dark spots in the gel 16 indi cate the sites of fatigue induced microcracks in the surface film 30 and thus the extent of fatigue damage in the metal.
