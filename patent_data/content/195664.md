# Bonding machine.

## Abstract
A machine for bonding connectors to the edge of a pcb by a Luc process has upper and lower wheels 5,18 which are translated along the edge of the pcb 2 for engaging the connectors to be applied respectively to the faces of the board. The relative position of the wheels at any given time is determined by mounting one of them to move with a jaw 9 which closes down onto one of the faces.
