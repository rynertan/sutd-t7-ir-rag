# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING ESSENTIALLY HOMOPOLYMER FREE SACCHARIDE GRAFT POLYMERS AND SACCHARIDE GRAFT POLYMERS OBTAINABLE THEREBY

## Abstract
Essentially homopolymer free saccharide graft polymers with a saccharide backbone of at least two alpha glucosidically linked saccharide units are produced according to the process of this invention by initiating the decomposition of a maltosac charide covalently linked to a group containing an azo radical or diazo radical and splitting off Nâ‚‚, in the presence of at least one ethylenically unsaturated compound to be grafted, so as to yield radicals maltosaccharide polymerization initiator radi cals which trigger a graft polymerization reaction resulting in saccharide graft polymers having graft branches covalently bound to the maltosaccharide moiety.
