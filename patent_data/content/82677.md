# Jacking apparatus and force transmitting methods.

## Abstract
In a jacking apparatus for application of force to at least two anchor points 22 for movement of a load, the force is transmitted through fluid in at least two equalizing cylinders 81 to 92 after which it is transmitted to the anchor points. The fluid pressure in each of the equalizing cylinders 81 to 92 is limited to a predetermined value to provide equal distribution of the load between all of the anchor points to which the jacking apparatus is or should be engaged.
