# Metal halogen secondary battery system.

## Abstract
The battery system has electrolyte circulating lines for its positive and negative plate galvanic reaction chambers 2, 3 , and incorporates in the electrolyte circulating lines clean ing lines and a deionized water circulating line including a positive plate galvanic reaction chamber cleaning solution tank TA 3 , a negative plate galvanic reaction chamber cleaning solution tank TA 4 , a deionized water tank TA 5 , a cleaning solution discharge pipe 8 and a plurality of pipes and on off valves for connecting and opening and closing the tanks and the discharge pipe, thereby making possible circu lation cleaning of the reaction chambers and ensuring resto ration of the battery characteristics and longer battery life.
