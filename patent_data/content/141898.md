# Strap chute for automatic strapping machine.

## Abstract
A strap chute is provided for an automatic strapping ma chine and comprises a plurality of sections adapted to be assembled together with the machine to form a loop like strap guide path around an article to be strapped. Each sec tion comprises a mounting frame having a pair of opposed fulcrum members, a pair of strap guides each having at least an outer retaining wall for guiding and retaining the strap when the strap guides are located in a closed position, and a biasing means for biasing the strap guides into the closed position. Each strap guide includes a lever member disposed adjacent one of the fulcrum members of the frame to accommodate pivoting movement of the strap guide be tween the closed position and an open position. The biasing means is disposed between the lever members of the strap guides for basing each strap guide lever member against one of the fulcrum members and for pivoting the lever mem bers so as to normally maintain the strap guides in the closed position.
