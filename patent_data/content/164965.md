## Description
This application relates to lymphokines. In particular, it relates to lymphotoxin and derivatives thereof. Lymphotoxin was first identified as a biological factor with anticellular activity on neoplastic cell lines. An activity identified as lymphotoxin and obtained from mitogen stimulated lymphocytes is associated with a spectrum of cytotoxic activities ranging from cytostasis of certain tumor cell lines to marked cytolysis of other transformed cells. However, lymphotoxin activity is characterized by little or no anticellular activity on primary cell cultures and normal cell lines tested. This putative discriminating anticellular property of lymphotoxin led to Lymphotoxin is the term applied to what has been described as a family of molecules. Lymphotoxin molecules have been identified as glycoproteins divided into five molecular weight classes, each of which in turn is heterogenous with respect to charge. The human alpha MW 70 90,000 and beta MW 25 50,000 classes appear to predominate in most lymphocyte supernatants. The alpha MW classes can be separated by charge into at least seven subclasses, while the beta subclass has been separated into two distinct subclasses G. Granger It should be understood that lymphokine terminology is not uniform. At present, the names given to cell culture products are largely a function of the cells which are believed to elaborate the product and the performance of the products in biological assays. However, these products remain poorly characterized in large measure because many studies have been conducted with partially pure preparations and because the assays used to characterize the products are not molecule specific and in any case are subject to considerable variation. The true identity of the various cytotoxic factors will remain unknown in the absence of standard terminology based on clearly assayable distinguishing characteristics such as amino acid sequences or immune epitopes. As examples of other names given to cytotoxic cell culture products are tumor necrosis factor, NK cell cytotoxic factor, hemorrhagic necrosis factor and macrophage cytotoxin or cytotoxic factor. EP 100,641A published Feb. 15, 1984 describe amino acid sequences for a human lymphotoxin isolated from the human lymphoblastoid cell line RPMI 1788. Hayashi D. Pennica et al. Nature 312 20 27 1984 discloses the purification and recombinant synthesis of a cytotoxic human polypeptide identified as tumor necrosis factor and having the N terminal amino acid sequence Ohnishi According to Toth and Granger, Mol. Immun. Subsequently, Proctor, Klostergaard and Granger Clinical Research , 1982, Other literature that should be studied in connection with this application includes Evans, Cancer Immunol. Immunother. The lymphotoxin or substances identified as lymphotoxin obtained heretofore from lymphocyte culture are present in low concentrations, on the order of 0.05 2x10⁶ units l in supernatants of RPMI 1788 cells or primary lymphocytes. The amounts harvested often vary considerably, and primary lymphocytes are expensive. An economical method for producing lymphotoxin is needed Yamamoto Prior methods also fail to produce lymphotoxin which is homogeneous as to amino acid sequence, an important feature for drug utilities. Lymphotoxin recovered from cell line culture exhibits amino terminal heterogeneity, probably due to proteolytic processing. Cultures of primary lymphocytes, e.g. from adenoids or peripheral blood, must necessarily contain the cells of many donors for reasons of economy. However, the products of these cells will reflect genetic variation among the donors so that the resulting lymphotoxin may in fact be a mixture of allelic species. Obviously, the proportions and identities of such alleles will be unknown from lot to lot. A method is needed for producing lymphotoxin that is uniform as to its amino acid sequence. Prior methods also are limited to the production of lymphotoxin having primary amino acid sequences corresponding to those found in nature. Substituting, deleting or inserting different amino acids in these sequences would require extensive and costly chemical modifications, if such could be accomplished at all. Methods are needed for easily introducing variations into the amino acid sequences of lymphotoxin. Although the antitumor effects and apparent therapeutic value of lymphotoxin activity have been reported in the literature since 1968, lymphotoxin has not been studied in extensive clinical protocols or commercialized due to the small quantities and heterogenous nature of the lymphotoxin made available through prior methods. Methods are needed to economically prepare quantities of lymphotoxin adequate for clinical studies. Rabbit antisera has been described in the literature which is capable of neutralizing the cytolytic activity of various cytotoxins, including substances identified as lymphotoxin Yamamoto It is a further object herein to provide methods for economically synthesizing a lymphotoxin form in a composition wherein the primary amino acid sequence of substantially all of the lymphotoxin molecules is the same. It is another object to produce predetermined variations in the amino acid sequence of a lymphotoxin form, more specifically, amino acid deletions, insertions, substitutions, or combinations thereof. The objectives of this invention have been accomplished by the successful recombinant expression of protein having lymphotoxin activity. This lymphotoxin species, which is described herein in terms of its activity and natural or variant amino acid sequence, is henceforth referred to as lymphotoxin. Surprisingly, the DNA encoding lymphotoxin has been identified notwithstanding the minute levels of lymphotoxin expressed in homologous cells and uncertainty as to the time at which messenger RNA encoding lymphotoxin appears in homologous cells. Also surprisingly, biologically active lymphotoxin is expressed in recombinant cells that do not glycosylate the lymphotoxin or that would not be expected to do so in the same fashion as homologous cells and the lymphotoxin so expressed is recovered having a substantially uniform amino acid sequence, without N terminal enzymatic hydrolysis. DNA encoding lymphotoxin is expressed in cell cultures in copious quantities exceeding 0.1 to 1x10¹¹ units liter of culture lysate. The lymphotoxin that is expressed by a recombinant host cell will depend upon the DNA employed to encode the lymphotoxin or its precursors as well as upon the host cell selected. The nucleic acid sequences employed herein for lymphotoxin synthesis are novel. They are characterized by nucleotide sequences that differ from the native or natural sequence in one or more of the following ways The DNA is free of introns, in the case of human lymphotoxin the intron present between nucleotides 284 and 285 Fig. 2a the DNA is free of nucleic acid encoding other proteins of the organism from which the DNA originated the nucleic acid encoding lymphotoxin is ligated into a vector and or the nucleic acid is capable of hybridizing to nucleic acid encoding lymphotoxin provided, however, that such hybridizing nucleic acid does not have the nucleotide sequence of natural DNA or RNA encoding lymphotoxin. Mutant nucleic acids encoding lymphotoxin are the product of recombinant manipulations. Silent mutations in the 5 untranslated or translated nucleic acid for lymphotoxin are provided in order to enhance expression levels in selected hosts, e.g. by reducing the probability of stem and loop messenger RNA structures in the 5 regions of the nucleic acid, or by substituting host preferred codons for those found in natural nucleic acid isolates. Mutations in the nucleic acids which are expressed rather than silent enable the preparation of lymphotoxin species having the amino acid sequence of native lymphotoxin or primary sequence variants thereof with amino acid sequences differing from the native lymphotoxin. The mutant lymphotoxin is recovered as such or is further processed by the host cell to obtain the desired lymphotoxin species. These nucleic acids or nucleic acids that hybridize therewith, or fragments thereof, are labelled and used in hybridization assays for the identification or determination of genetic material encoding lymphotoxin. In processes for the synthesis of lymphotoxin, DNA which encodes lymphotoxin is ligated into a vector, the vector used to transform host cells, the host cells cultured and lymphotoxin recovered from the culture. This general process is used to synthesize lymphotoxin having the amino acid sequence of native lymphotoxin or to construct novel lymphotoxin variants, depending upon vector construction and the host cell chosen for transformation. The lymphotoxin species which are capable of synthesis herein include leucyl amino terminal lymphotoxin, histidyl amino terminal lymphotoxin, pre lymphotoxin, and lymphotoxin variants including a fusion proteins wherein a heterologous protein or polypeptide is linked by a peptide bond to the amino and or carboxyl terminal amino acids of lymphotoxin, b lymphotoxin fragments, especially fragments of pre lymphotoxin in which any amino acid between 34 and 23 is the amino terminal amino acid of the fragment, c lymphotoxin mutants wherein one or more amino acid residues are substituted, inserted or deleted, d methionyl or modified methionyl such as formyl methionyl or other blocked methionyl species amino terminal derivatives, and or e unglycosylated or variantly glycosylated species of all of the foregoing. If a mammalian cell is transformed with nucleic acid encoding lymphotoxin operably ligated to a eucaryotic secretory leader including the native lymphotoxin secretory leader , or if nucleic acid which encodes lymphotoxin is operably ligated in a vector to a procaryotic or yeast secretory leader which is recognized by the host cell to be transformed usually the organism from which the leader sequence was obtained , the host transformed with the vector and cultured, then nonmethionylated amino terminal lymphotoxin species ordinarily are recovered from the culture. If DNA encoding lymphotoxin is operably ligated into a vector without a secretory leader sequence and then used to transform a host cell, the lymphotoxin species which are synthesized are generally substituted with an amino terminal methionyl or modified methionyl residue such as formyl methionyl. Methods are provided whereby Secondly, Finally, unglycosylated or variantly glycosylated lymphotoxins are provided as novel lymphotoxin species. Unglycosylated lymphotoxin is produced by prokaryotic expression of DNA encoding lymphotoxin. Variantly glycosylated lymphotoxin species are the product of recombinant culture in transformed higher eukaryotic, ordinarily mammalian, cells. The lymphotoxin produced herein is purified from culture supernatants or lysates by immunoaffinity adsorption using insolubilized lymphotoxin neutralizing antibody. This antibody, which is most efficiently produced in monoclonal cell culture, is raised in mice by immunization with alum adsorbed lymphotoxin. The lymphotoxin of this invention is combined for therapeutic use with physiologically innocuous stabilizers and excipients and prepared in sterile dosage form as by lyophilization in dosage vials or storage in stabilized aqueous preparations. Alternatively, the lymphotoxin is incorporated into a polymer matrix for implantation into tumors or surgical sites from which tumors have been excised, thereby effecting a timed release of the lymphotoxin in a localized high gradient concentration. The therapeutic compositions herein are administered in therapeutically effective doses by implantation, injection or infusion into animals, particularly human patients, that bear malignant tumors. Fig. 1a depicts a DNA sequence and its putative amino acid sequence encoding a lymphotoxin fragment. Fig. 1b demonstrates the construction of synthetic DNA encoding the Fig. 1a fragment. Fig. 2a shows the complete amino acid sequence for pre lymphotoxin, its coding DNA plus 5 and 3 flanking untranslated regions. Fig. 2b illustrates a method of constructing an expression vector for methionyl leucyl amino terminal lymphotoxin and its amino terminal methionyl derivatives. Fig. 3 shows a method of constructing an expression vector for methionyl histidyl amino terminal lymphotoxin. Fig. 4 depicts the amino acid sequences for human, murine and bovine lymphotoxin, and the consensus mammalian lymphotoxin residues. Figs. 5a and 5b depict the construction of a plasmid encoding a fusion of lymphotoxin and a bacterial signal sequence. Lymphotoxin is defined for the purposes of this application as a biologically active polypeptide having a region demonstrating substantial structural amino acid homology with at least a portion of the lymphotoxin amino acid sequence shown in Fig. 2a. Biological activity is defined as preferential, cytotoxic activity as defined below, immunological cross reactivity with a cytotoxic lymphotoxin or the ability to compete with cytotoxic lymphotoxin for lymphotoxin cell surface receptors. In the latter two instances the lymphotoxin need not be cytotoxic Preferential cytotoxic activity is defined as the preferential destruction or growth inhibition of tumor cells Suitable assays for detecting the anticellular activities of lymphotoxin are described in B. Aggarwal, Lymphotoxin specific activity is defined herein in terms of target cell lysis, rather than cytostasis. One unit of lymphotoxin is defined as the amount required for 50 percent lysis of target cells plated in each well as is further described in Example 1. However, other methods for determining cytotoxic activity are acceptable. Substantial structural homology generally means that greater than about 60 percent, and usually greater than about 70 percent of the amino acid residues in the polypeptide are the same or conservative substitutions for the corresponding residue s in the sequence of Fig. 2a. Not all of the sequence of a lymphotoxin polypeptide need be homologous with the Fig. 2a sequence. Only a portion thereof need be homologous with any portion of the Fig. 2a sequence so long as the candidate exhibits the required biological activity. Generally, homology should be demonstrable for regions of about from 20 to 100 amino acid residues, recognizing that occasional gaps may need to be introduced in order to maximize the homology. Less homology is required for polypeptides to fall within the definition if the region of homology with the Fig. 2a sequence is not in one of the lymphotoxin key regions, Lymphotoxin is defined to specifically exclude human tumor necrosis factor or its natural animal analogues D. Pennica Structurally similar refers to dominant characteristics of the amino acid side chains such as basic, neutral or acid, hydrophilic or hydrophobic, or the presence or absence of steric bulk. Substitution of one structurally similar amino acid for another generally is known in the art as a conservative substitution. A significant factor in establishing the identity of a polypeptide as lymphotoxin is the ability of antisera which are capable of substantially neutralizing the cytolytic activity of substantially homogeneous, lymphoblastoid or natural lymphotoxin to also substantially neutralize the cytolytic activity of the polypeptide in question. However it will be recognized that immunological identity and cytotoxic identity are not necessarily coextensive. A neutralizing antibody for the lymphotoxin of Fig. 2a may not bind a candidate protein because the neutralizing antibody happens to be directed to a site on lymphotoxin that merely neighbors a region that is critical to lymphotoxin cytotoxic activity, but which acts as a neutralizing antibody by steric hinderance of the lymphotoxin active site. A candidate protein mutated in this innocuous region might no longer bind the neutralizing antibody, but it would nonetheless be lymphotoxin in terms of substantial homology and biological activity. Lymphotoxin obtained by culture of lymphoblastoid cell lines has been determined to have the following characteristics A molecular weight of 20,000 or 25,000, depending upon the degree of glycosylation and N terminal heterogeneity glycosylation at Asn 62 Fig. 2a a tendency to aggregate, particularly to organize into multimers an isoelectric point of about 5.8 pH lability a loss of 50 percent of cytolytic activity when stored for 24 hours in ammonium bicarbonate buffer at 10 µg ml concentration with pH levels less than about 5 or greater than about 10 and substantial losses in activity upon incubation in aqueous solution for 5 min. at 80 C. Two lymphoblastoid lymphotoxin molecular weight species have been identified. The 25,000 da species of lymphoblastoid lymphotoxin has an amino terminal leucine residue. Polypeptides having the primary amino acid sequence of the 25,000 da species are called leucyl amino terminal lymphotoxin. The 20,000 da species of lymphoblastoid lymphotoxin is characterized by an amino terminal histidine and corresponding sequences are termed histidyl amino terminal lymphotoxin. It is important to observe that these characteristics describe the native or wild type human lymphotoxin obtained from lymphoblastoid cell cultures. While lymphotoxin as defined herein includes native, glycosylated lymphotoxin, other related cytotoxic polypeptides many fall within the scope of the definition. For example, the glycosylation ordinarily associated with an animal lymphotoxin may be modified upon expression in a heterologous recombinant eukaryotic host cell, thereby bringing the modified lymphotoxin outside of the molecular weights or isoelectric point established for human lymphoblastoid lymphotoxin. Lymphotoxin which is entirely unglycosylated is produced in recombinant bacterial culture with its molecular weight, isoelectric point and other characteristics correspondingly modified. In addition, post translational processing of pre lymphotoxin from a first animal species in a cell line derived from another animal species may result in a different amino terminal residue than is ordinarily the case for the first animal species. Similarly, the mutagenesis procedures provided herein, for example, will enable one to vary the amino acid sequence and N terminus of lymphotoxin, thereby modifying the pH stability, isoelectric point and the like. The translated amino acid sequence for human lymphotoxin is described in Fig. 2a. Note that this sequence includes a 34 residue presequence which is believed to be removed during normal processing of the translated transcript in human cells herein, together with its mutants, pre lymphotoxin , resulting in the leucyl amino terminal species. The histidyl amino terminal species is homologous to the leucyl amino terminal species except that the first 23 amino acids of the leucyl amino terminal species are absent. All three species, i.e. pre lymphotoxin, leucyl amino terminal lymphotoxin and histidyl amino terminal lymphotoxin, as well as their methionyl, modified methionyl, mutant and unglycosylated forms, are included within the scope of lymphotoxin. The unglycosylated leucyl and histidyl amino terminal species will have lower molecular weights than described above for the homologous species from lymphoblastoid cells. Pre lymphotoxin is a species of lymphotoxin included within the foregoing definition. It is characterized by the presence of a signal or leader polypeptide at the amino terminus of the molecule. Generally, the native signal polypeptide of lymphotoxin is proteolytically cleaved from lymphotoxin as part of the secretory process in which the protein is secreted from the cell. The signal peptide may be microbial or mammalian including the native, 34 residue presequence , but it preferably is a signal which is homologous to the host cell. Some signal lymphotoxin fusions are not recognized or processed by the host cell into N terminal met free lymphotoxin. Such fusions containing microbial signals have utility for example as lymphotoxin immunogens. Note that the language capable of cytotoxic activity means that lymphotoxin includes polypeptides which can be converted, as by enzymatic hydrolysis, from an inactive state analogous to a zymogen to a polypeptide fragment which exhibits the desired biological activity. The language capable of While lymphotoxin ordinarily means human lymphotoxin, lymphotoxin from sources such as murine, porcine, equine or bovine is included within the definition of lymphotoxin so long as it otherwise meets the standards described above for homologous regions and biological activity. For example, bovine and murine lymphotoxins have been found to be highly about 80 percent homologous with human lymphotoxin. Lymphotoxin is not species specific, e.g., human lymphotoxin is active on mouse tumors and neoplastic cell lines. Therefore, lymphotoxin from one species can be used in therapy of another. Lymphotoxin also includes multimeric forms. Lymphotoxin spontaneously aggregates into multimers, usually dimers or higher multimers. Multimers are cytotoxic and accordingly are suitable for use in Variant lymphotoxins include predetermined or targeted, i.e. site specific, mutations of the Fig. 2a molecule or its fragments. Variant lymphotoxins are defined as polypeptides otherwise meeting the defined characteristics of lymphotoxin but which are characterized by an amino acid sequence that differs from that of Fig. 2a, whether by omission, substitution or insertion of residues. The nonhuman lymphotoxins described herein, and alleles of human lymphotoxin, are to be considered variant lymphotoxins, as are site directed mutants having no natural counterpart. The objective of mutagenesis is to construct DNA that encodes lymphotoxin as defined above but exhibits characteristics that modify the biological activity of natural lymphotoxin or facilitate the manufacture of lymphotoxin. For example, the lysine 89 codon is mutated in order to express a histidine residue in place of the lysine residue. The histidine 89 is no longer hydrolyzed by trypsin which generally cleaves proteins at an arg X or lys X bond . Protease resistance is expected to confer greater biological half life on the mutant than is the case for lymphotoxin having the sequence of Fig. 2a or a fragment thereof . Other lymphotoxin lysine or arginine residues may be mutated to histidine, for example lysine 28, lysine 19 or arginine 15. As discussed above, certain regions of the lymphotoxin molecule exhibit substantial homology with a similarly active protein designated tumor necrosis factor. Amino acid residues in and immediately flanking these substantially homologous regions are preferred for mutagenesis directed to identifying lymphotoxin nutants that exhibit variant biological or cytotoxic activity. Such mutants are made by methods known A particularly desirable group of mutants are those in which the methionine residues at human lymphotoxin residues 20, 120 and 133 are deleted or, preferably, substituted for by the corresponding residues found in the lymphotoxins of other species such as are described elsewhere herein. For example met 20, 120 and 133 are substituted by threonine, serine and valine, respectively. These are the corresponding residues in bovine lymphotoxin. The substitution is effected in the manner described in Example 9 except that met 133 is mutated to val by a further step of mutagenesis using M13 Mp8 phage in accord with methods known Other useful variant lymphotoxins are those in which residues from tumor necrosis factor are substituted for corresponding lymphotoxin residues to produce hybrid tumor necrosis factor lymphotoxin variants. A representative example is the substitution of the first 8, 9 or 10 residues of mature tumor necrosis factor e.g., val arg ser ser ser arg thr pro ser asp for the first 27 residues of leucyl amino terminal lymphotoxin. This variant is more likely to be N terminal demethionylated upon direct expression in While the mutation site is predetermined, it is unnecessary that the mutation Lymphotoxin also may contain insertions, usually on the order of about from 1 to 10 amino acid residues, or deletions of about from 1 to 30 residues. Substitutions, deletions, insertions or any subcombination may be combined to arrive at a final construct. Insertions include amino or carboxyl terminal fusions, e.g. a hydrophobic extension added to the carboxyl terminus. Preferably, however, only substitution mutagenesis is conducted. Obviously, the mutations in the encoding DNA must not place the sequence out of reading frame and preferably will not create complementary regions that could produce secondary mRNA structure. Extracts of Not all mutations in the DNA which encodes the lymphotoxin will be expressed in the ultimated product of recombinant cell culture. For example, a major class of DNA substitution mutations are those DNAs in which a different secretory leader has been substituted for the Fig. 2a secretory leader, either by deletions within the 34 residue leader or by substitutions, which exchange of most or all of the native leader for a leader more likely to be recognized by the intended host. For example, in constructing a procaryotic expression vector the Fig. 2a secretory leader is deleted in favor of the bacterial alkaline phosphatase or heat stable enterotoxin II leaders, and for yeast the Fig. 2a leader is substituted in favor of the yeast invertase, alpha factor or acid phosphatase leaders. This is not to imply, however, that the human secretory leader is not recognized by hosts other than human cell lines. When the secretory leader is recognized by the host, the fusion protein consisting of lymphotoxin and the leader ordinarily is cleaved at the leader lymphotoxin peptide bond in the same event that leads to secretion of the lymphotoxin. Thus, even though a mutant DNA is used to transform the host the resulting product lymphotoxin may be either a fused or native lymphotoxin, depending upon the efficacy of the host cell in processing the fusion. Another major class of DNA mutants that are not expressed as lymphotoxin variants are nucleotide substitutions made to enhance expression, primarily by avoiding stem loop structures in the transcribed mRMA see copending U.S.S.N. 303,687, EP 75444 or to provide codons that are more readily transcribed by the selected host, e.g. the well known The mutant nucleic acid is made by known methods Nucleic acid encoding lymphotoxin is any DNA or RNA sequence that encodes a polypeptide falling within the definition of lymphotoxin herein, whether or not the nucleotide sequences thereof correspond to the sequences found in nature. In addition, nucleic acid is included within the scope herein that is capable of hybridizing under at least low stringency conditions to nucleic acid encoding lymphotoxin, even if the hybridizing nucleic acid does not encode a protein otherwise meeting the definitional requirements for lymphotoxin. An example of the latter would be a probe that, because of the short length of polypeptide that it encodes, is incapable of expressing a biologically active lymphotoxin. The nucleic acid encoding lymphotoxin or capable of hybridizing therewith is prepared by organic synthesis, substantially as shown in Example 1, or obtained from natural sources by probing genomic or cDNA libraries as shown in the Examples. The lymphotoxin of this invention is made by a process generally entailing the transformation of a host with a vector bearing the nucleic acid that encodes the desired lymphotoxin. A vector is a replicable DNA construct. Vectors are used herein to amplify DNA or to express DNA which encodes lymphotoxin. An expression vector is a DNA construct in which a DNA sequence encoding lymphotoxin is operably linked to a suitable control sequence capable of effecting the expression of lymphotoxin in a suitable host. Such control sequences include a transcriptional promoter, an optional operator sequence to control transcription, a sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosomal binding sites, and sequences which control termination of transcription and translation. The vector may be a plasmid, a virus including phage , or an integratable DNA fragment i.e., integratable into the host genome by recombination . Once transformed into a suitable host, the vector replicates and functions independently of the host genome, or may, in some instances, integrate into the genome itself. In the present specification, plasmid and vector are sometimes used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector at present. However, all other forms of vectors which serve an equivalent function and which are, or become, known in the art are suitable for use herein. Suitable vectors will contain replicon and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the intended expression host. Transformed host cells are cells which have been transformed or transfected with lymphotoxin vectors constructed using recombinant DNA techniques. Transformed host cells ordinarily express lymphotoxin. The expressed lymphotoxin will be deposited intracellularly or secreted into either the periplasmic space or the culture supernatant, depending upon the host cell selected. DNA regions are operably linked when they are functionally related to each other. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein which participates in the secretion of the polypeptide a promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence if it controls the transcription of the sequence or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to permit translation. Generally, operably linked means contiguous and, in the case of secretory leaders, contiguous and in reading phase. Suitable host cells are prokaryotes, yeast or higher eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes include gram negative or gram positive organisms, for example Prokaryotic host vector systems are preferred for the expression of lymphotoxin. A plethora of suitable microbial vectors are available. Generally, a microbial vector will contain an origin of replication recognized by the intended host, a promoter which will function in the host and a phenotypic selection gene, for example a gene encoding proteins conferring antibiotic resistance or supplying an auxotrophic requirement. Similar constructs will be manufactured for other hosts. Expression vectors must contain a promoter which is recognized by the host organism, but cloning vectors need not. The promoter generally is homologous to the intended host. Promoters most commonly used in recombinant DNA construction include the β lactamase penicillinase and lactose promoter systems Chang In addition to prokaryates, eukaryotic microbes such as yeast cultures are transformed with lymphotoxin encoding vectors. Suitable promoting sequences in yeast vectors include the promoters for metallothionein, 3 phosphoglycerate kinase Hitzeman Other promoters, which have the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions, are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism, and the aforementioned metallothionein and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase, as well as enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. In constructing suitable expression plasmids, the termination sequences associated with these genes are also ligated into the expression vector 3 of the lymphotoxin coding sequences to provide polyadenylation of the mRNA and termination. In addition to microorganisms, cultures of cells derived from multicellular organisms may also be used as hosts. This, however, is not preferred because of the excellent results obtained thus far with lymphotoxin expressing microbes. In principal, any higher eukaryotic cell culture is workable, whether from vertebrate or invertebrate culture. However, interest has been greatest in vertebrate cells, and propagation of vertebrate cells in culture tissue culture has become a routine procedure in recent years The transcriptional and translational control sequences in expression vectors to be used in transforming vertebrate cells are often provided by viral sources. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma, Adenovirus 2, and most preferably Simian Virus 40 SV40 . The early and late promoters are particularly useful because both are obtained easily from the virus as a fragment which also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication Fiers An origin of replication may be provided either by construction of the vector to include an exogenous origin, such as may be derived from SV40 or other viral e.g. Polyoma, Adenovirus, VSV, or BPV source, or may be provided by the host cell chromosomal replication mechanism. If the vector is integrated into the host cell chromosome, the latter is often sufficient. Lymphotoxin is prepared without an amino terminal methionyl by transformation of higher eukaryotic cells with the human pre lymphotoxin DNA. In selecting a preferred host mammalian cell for transfection by vectors which comprise DNA sequences encoding both lymphotoxin and dihydrofolate reductase DHFR , it is appropriate to select the host according to the type of DHFR protein employed. If wild type DHFR protein is employed, it is preferable to select a host cell which is deficient in DHFR thus permitting the use of the DHFR coding sequence as a marker for successful transfection in selective medium which lacks hypoxanthine, glycine, and thymidine. An appropriate host cell in this case is the Chinese hamster ovary CHO cell line deficient in DHFR activity, prepared and propagated as described by Urlaub and Chasin, 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA On the other hand, if DNA encoding DHFR protein with low binding affinity for methotrexate MTX is used as the controlling sequence, it is not necessary to use DHFR resistant cells. Because the mutant DHFR is resistant to MTX, MTX containing media can be used as a means of selection provided that the host cells are themselves MTX sensitive. Most eukaryotic cells which are capable of absorbing MTX appear to be methotrexate sensitive. One such useful cell line is a CHO line, CHO K1 ATCC No. CCL 61 . Transformed host cells are cells which have been transformed or transfected with lymphotoxin vectors constructed using recombinant DNA techniques. Transformed host cells ordinarily express lymphotoxin. The expressed lymphotoxin ordinarily is deposited intracellularly. Lymphotoxin is recovered from recombinant culture in nonsecreting cells by lysing the cells and removing particulate matter by centrifugation or the like. Lymphotoxin secreting cells are separated from culture supernatant by centrifugation. The contaminated lymphotoxin solution is then purified by the methods referred to above or by immunoaffinity as described in Example 4 below. The lymphotoxin is purified to levels suitable for pharmacological use and placed into conventional dosage forms, e.g. vials or syringes. Mixtures of lymphotoxin variants are employed, e.g. a bank of cytotoxic mutant lymphotoxin species. Lymphotoxin optimally is lyophilized for long term storage, or it may be placed in aqueous solution with stabilizers and excipients, for example isotonic saline, and administered to patients as disclosed by B. Aggarwal Lymphotoxin compositions are administered to tumor bearing animals. The route of administration is in accord with known methods, e.g. intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intralesional infusion or injection of sterile lymphotoxin solutions, or by timed release systems described below. Lymphotoxin is administered intralesionally, i.e., by direct injection into solid tumors. In the case of disseminated tumors such as leukemia, administration is preferably intravenous or into the lymphatic system. Tumors of the abdominal organs such as ovarian cancer are advantageously treated by intraperitoneal infusion using peritoneal dialysis hardware and peritoneum compatible solutions. Ordinarily, however, lymphotoxin is administered continuously by infusion although bolus injection is acceptable. Lymphotoxin desirably is administered from an implantable timed release article. Examples of suitable systems for proteins having the molecular weight of lymphotoxin dimers or trimers include copolymers of L glutamic acid and gamma ethyl L glutamate U. Sidman The amount of lymphotoxin that is administered will depend, for example, upon the route of administration, the tumor in question and the condition of the patient. It will be necessary for the therapist to titer the dosage and modify the route of administration as required to obtain optimal cytotoxic activity towards the target tumor, as can be determined for example by biopsy of the tumor or diagnostic assays for putative cancer markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen, in view of any recombinant toxicity encountered at elevated dosage. Ordinarily, recombinant lymphotoxin dosages in mice at about from 50 to 200 µg kg body weight day by intravenous administration have been found to be substantially nontoxic and efficacious A method is provided herein for obtaining lymphotoxin neutralizing antibody. Neutralizing antibody is defined as antibody that is capable of immunologically binding lymphotoxin as defined herein in such a way as to substantially reduce its activity in cytostatic or cytolytic lymphotoxin activity as says such as the murine L929 assay described below. The fact that the antibody is capable of neutralizing lymphotoxin activity does not mean that the antibody must bind directly to the lymphotoxin active or receptor binding site. The antibody may still substantially neutralize lymphotoxin activity if it sterically binds to a region which adjacent to the critical site, i.e., adjacent in the sense of conformationally adjacent and not necessarily adjacent from the point of view of amino acid sequence. In attempting to prepare a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against lymphotoxin, it proved difficult to immunize mice in a fashion such that lymphotoxin neutralizing antibody is generated or raised in the animals. Neither immunization with lymphoblastoid lymphotoxin nor glutaraldehyde cross linked lymphotoxin resulted in any detectable neutralizing antibody in the serum of immunized mice, even though the mice did raise non neutralizing anti lymphotoxin antibody detectable by enzyme immunoassay. However, immunization with a lymphotoxin alum aluminum hydroxide or alumina, Al₂O₃.3H₂O adsorption complex will raise neutralizing antibody even in animals which had failed to generate the activity prior to immunization with the alum complex. Preparation of alum and its use in the production of antiserum are disclosed in C. Williams, Fusions of spleen cells from animals producing neutralizing antibody with murine myeloma cells are made. On the average, about 50 to 100 clones will have to be screened to identify one which synthesizes neutralizing antibody. The process for screening the clones for the desired activity is routine and well within the skill of the ordinary artisan, and can be reproduced with minimal experimental effort. The serum, plasma or IgG fractions from the immunized animal, as well as immunoglobulins secreted by hybridomas generated from the spleen or lymph cell of immunized animals, are all satisfactory for use herein. In a preferred embodiment the neutralizing antibody is obtained essentially free of other anti lymphotoxin antibody in hybridoma culture. The neutralizing antibody is immobilized by adsorption to surfaces, e.g., thermoplastics such as polystyrene, or covalently bound to matrices such as cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose. It then is used in immunoassays or in immunoaffinity purification. Since the antibody is a neutralizing antibody it is most likely only to adsorb or detect biologically active lymphotoxin or fragments thereof. The antibody is particularly useful in immunoradiometric sandwich immunoassays in concert with a non neutralizing anti lymphotoxin monoclonal antibody or a polyclonal antiserum which contains non neutralizing anti lymphotoxin. The immunoassay is conducted using either the neutralizing or non neutralizing antibody as the labelled component, which labelling is effective with a detectable substance such as a fluorescent, chemiluminescent or radioisotopic label in accord with methods known in the art. For competitive type lymphotoxin immunoassays, lymphotoxin is labelled in the same fashion. Chloramine T radioiodination is suitable for both lymphotoxin and lymphotoxin antibody tracer preparation, or the method described in J. Klostergaard In order to simplify the Examples certain frequently occurring methods will be referenced by shorthand phrases. Plasmids are designated by a low case p preceded and or followed by capital letters and or numbers. The starting plasmids herein are commercially available, are publically available on an unrestricted basis, or can be constructed from such available plasmids in accord with published procedures. In addition, other equivalent plasmids are known in the art and will be apparent to the ordinary artisan. Digestion of DNA refers to catalytic cleavage of the DNA with an enzyme that acts only at certain locations in the DNA. Such enzymes are called restriction enzymes, and the sites for which each is specific is called a restriction site. Partial digestion refers to incomplete digestion by a restriction enzyme, i.e., conditions are chosen that result in cleavage of some but not all of the sites for a given restriction endonuclease in a DNA substrate. The various restriction enzymes used herein are commercially available and their reaction conditions, cofactors and other requirements as established by the enzyme suppliers were used. Restriction enzymes commonly are designated by abbreviations composed of a capital letter followed by other letters and then, generally, a number representing the microorganism from which each restriction enzyme originally was obtained. In general, about 1 µg of plasmid or DNA fragment is used with about 1 unit of enzyme in about 20 µl of buffer solution. Appropriate buffers and substrate amounts for particular restriction enzymes are specified by the manufacturer. Incubation times of about 1 hour at 37 C are ordinarily used, but may vary in accordance with the supplier s instructions. After incubation, protein is removed by extraction with phenol and chloroform, and the digested nucleic acid is recovered from the aqueous fraction by precipitation with ethanol. Digestion with a restriction enzyme infrequently is followed with bacterial alkaline phosphatase hydrolysis of the terminal 5 phosphates to prevent the two restriction cleaved ends of a DNA fragment from circularizing or forming a closed loop that would impede insertion of another DNA fragment at the restriction site. Unless otherwise stated, digestion of plasmids is not followed by 5 terminal dephosphorylation. Procedures and reagents for dephosphorylation are conventional T. Maniatis Recovery or isolation of a given fragment of DNA from a restriction digest means separation of the digest on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, identification of the fragment of interest by comparison of its mobility versus that of marker DNA fragments of known molecular weight, removal of the gel section containing the desired fragment, and separation of the gel from DNA. This procedure is known generally. For example, see R. Lawn Southern Analysis is a method by which the presence of DNA sequences in a digest or DNA containing composition is confirmed by hybridization to a known, labelled oligonucleotide or DNA fragment. For the purposes herein, unless otherwise provided, Southern analysis shall mean separation of digests on 1 percent agarose, denaturation and transfer to nitrocellulose by the method of E. Southern, 1975, J. Mol. Biol. Transformation means introducing DNA into an organism so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or chromosomal integrant. Unless otherwise provided, the method used herein for transformation of Ligation refers to the process of forming phosphodiester bonds between two double stranded nucleic acid fragments T. Maniatis Preparation of DNA from transformants means isolating plasmid DNA from microbial culture. Unless otherwise provided, the alkaline SDS method of Maniatis Oligonucleotides are short length single or double stranded polydeoxynucleotides which are chemically synthesized by the method incorporated by reference into Example 1, and then purified on polyacrylamide gels.

The human lymphoblastoid cell line RPMI 1788 ATCC No. CCL 156 as grown in 15L spinner flasks to a cell density of 4x10⁵ cells per ml using a serum free culture medium RPMI 1640 . Lymphotoxin was induced 10 20 fold to 500 1000 lymphotoxin units ml, determined as described below over basal levels by the inclusion of 20 ng ml of phorbol myristate acetate in the serum free RPMI 1640 medium. After 65 h of culture, the cells were harvested by filtration, and the lymphotoxin activity in the filtrate was absorbed to controlled pore glass beads Electronucleonics in a column 5 cm x 20 cm , equilibrated with 5mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and eluted with 50 percent ethylene glycol in 5mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 . 0.1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride PMSF , a protease inhibitor, and 1 mM sodium azide, for inhibition of microbial growth, were included in all buffers throughout the purification. The eluate from glass beads contained 84,000 units of lymphotoxin mg protein. This was followed by DEAE cellulose chromatography, Lentil Lectin Sepharose chromatography, and preparative native PAGE as described in B. Aggarwal, This lymphotoxin preparation contained greater than 95 percent by weight of the leucyl amino terminal lymphotoxin having an approximate molecular weight of 25,000 on SDS PAGE. The theoretical molecular weight of the protein component of the N terminal leucyl species is 18,664 daltons the remaining approximately 6,500 daltons was attributed to a glycosyl side chain at Asn 62, and perhaps other O linked sugar residues. The tissue culture supernatant contained putative multimers of this species 60,000 Da by TSK HPLC or 64,000 Da by Sephadex G 100 chromatography . The remaining 5 percent of the lymphotoxin mixture was the N terminal histidyl species having a molecular weight of about 20,000. Both species exhibit substantially the same cytolytic activity, at least within the limits of the variation inherent in the murine fibroblast cell lysis assay described below. Tryptic digestion of the intact lymphotoxin molecules yielded only a few fragments. Histidyl amino terminal lymphotoxin was digested into two fragments between amino acid positions 89 and 90, while the leucyl amino terminal tryptic digestion yielded four fragments cleaved between positions 15 and 16, 19 and 20, and 89 and 90. Micro sequencing by the Edman degradation technique yielded sequence information on the intact molecule and also on the fragments produced by tryptic cleavage. Further sequence information was provided by fragments of lymphotoxin produced by carboxypeptidase P and chymotrypsin digestion, acetic acid digestion and cyanogen bromide cleavage. Nearly the entire sequence of the human lymphotoxin was determined by this method. 156 contiguous residues were determined from the amino terminus. It was clear from this sequencing information that the difference between the two lymphotoxin species was the presence of 23 amino terminal residues in the leucyl amino terminal species which were not found in the histidyl amino terminal species. The carboxyl terminal sequence beyond the first three residues proved to be difficult to determine because of certain peptide bonds present in this region and the hydrophobic nature of the residues. A synthetic gene was designed which would code for the protein sequence to the extent determined by micro sequencing. The gene design incorporated a general The 58 original oligomers designed for the synthetic lymphotoxin gene were synthesized by the solid phase phosphite method of M. Matteucci The gene was constructed in three separate pieces. The first, Segment A, was 117 base pairs in length and represented the 5 coding region for the amino terminal end of the leucyl amino terminal species. Segment B represented the DNA encoding the middle of the lymphotoxin molecule and was 145 base pairs in length. Segment C, at 217 base pairs in length, was believed to encode all but 16 amino acid residues at the lymphotoxin carboxy terminus. The oligomers required to synthesize each of the segments were purified by electrophoresis and then pooled. The relatively small size of each oligomer that is, 16 to 20 bases was chosen to reduce errors in synthesis. Each group of oligomers was phosphorylated in a reaction containing 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 , 10 mM MgCl₂, 20 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM ATP, and 15 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase in a volume of 50 µl approximately 50 pmol of each oligomer was contained in the reaction. After 30 minutes at 37 C, the reaction was heated to 65 C to destroy kinase activity, and then allowed to slowly cool to 20 C over the period of one hour. The phosphorylated oligomers were then ligated by the addition of 10 units of T4 DNA ligase and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 hours at 20 C. The DNA ligase was heat inactivated and then the ligated oligomers were digested for 3 hours at 37 C with restriction endonucleases which recognized the designed terminal sites e.g., XbaI and BamHI for segment A . Fragments for each segment were isolated by electrophoresis on a 7 percent polyacrylamide gel. Fragments of the correct mobility were identified for each segment by ethidium bromide staining and electroeluted from the gel. pFIFtrp69 D. Goeddel To determine if the synthetic gene would indeed produce biologically active lymphotoxin, the Lymphotoxin activity was determined by the modified cell lytic assay of B. Spofford, 1974, J. Immunol. RNA was isolated from a culture of a non adherent cell fraction of human peripheral blood lymphocytes 48 hours after induction with phorbol myristate acetate 10 ng ml , staphylococcal enterotoxin B 1 µg ml and thymosin α 1 S. Berger Two phage hybridized with the probe and were plaque purified. The purified phage hybridized with both the Segment A probe and a probe prepared from Segment B. The cDNA inserts of the two hybridizing phage, λLTl and λLT2, were subcloned into M13mp8 and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method A. Smith, 1980, Methods in Enzymology This construction is shown in Fig. 2b. pLTXB1 containing the inactive synthetic gene was partially digested with EcoRI and PstI, and a 685 bp fragment containing DNA encoding 125 N terminal residues of lymphotoxin was recovered. A partial PstI digest was performed because of the presence of an additional PstI site at residue 10 Fig. 1a . A 301 bp fragment containing DNA encoding the C terminal 51 amino acids of lymphotoxin was isolated by digesting the subcloned cDNA of λLT1 with EcoRI and PstI these sites are shown above in Fig. 2a at nucleotide positions 554 and 855 . These fragments were isolated by electrophoresis on 5 percent polyacrylamide and electroelution. The fragments were ligated into pBR322 which had been digested with EcoRI and dephosphorylated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase to reduce background transformants. The resulting expression plasmid, pLTtrp1, was characterized as to proper orientation and sequence by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequencing. Leucyl amino terminal lymphotoxin was expressed by transforming A murine monoclonal cell line secreting anti lymphotoxin Example 8 was grown in mice and purified from ascites fluid by ion exchange chromatography. The anion exchange eluate was coupled to cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose at a concentration of 2 mg ml resin. A 20 ml column was equilibrated consecutively with TBS containing 0.05 M Tris HCl, pH 7.0, 0.15 M sodium chloride, and 2mM EDTA then with elution buffer containing 0.1 M acetic acid, pH 4.5, 150 mM sodium chloride and finally with TBS. A 40 percent saturated ammonium sulfate precipitate of pLTtrp1 transformed The eluate contained most of the activity loaded onto the column. The majority of the total eluate protein migrated as a single band under both reducing and nonreducing conditions in SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mobility of this band corresponds to approximately 18,000 MW, which is consistent with the predicted value of 18,664 MW fur unglycosylated leucyl amino terminal lymphotoxin based on the deduced amino acid sequence. To further characterize its biological activities, the purified recombinant lymphotoxin was tested for cytolytic activity Recombinant and lymphoblastoid lymphotoxin were tested in an Lymphoblastoid lymphotoxin was injected dissolved in buffer 1 0.01 M Tris HCl, 0.05 M NH₄ ₂HCO₃, pH 8.0 and recombinant lymphotoxin was injected dissolved in Buffer 2 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 M sodium acetate and 0.1 M Tris HCl, pH 7.8 . The absence of carbohydrate on recombinant lymphotoxin does not appear to affect biological activity, since the specific activity of lymphotoxin produced by recombinant culture 2 10x10⁷ units mg is approximately the same as that reported for lymphoblastoid lymphotoxin 4x10⁷ units mg . The recombinant lymphotoxin activity also exhibited thermolability similar to natural lymphotoxin, i.e., inactivation in aqueous solution after heating for 1 hour at 80 C. Construction of a plasmid which directs the expression in A plasmid containing DNA encoding a fusion of lymphotoxin with a bacterial protein was constructed by cloning a sequence coding for a bacterial signal sequence adjacent to the structural gene for lymphotoxin. The sequence of the gene for the heat stable Enterotoxin II STII of The plasmid pWM501 Picken The EcoRI PstI fragment was subcloned into pBR322. This was accomplished by digesting pBR322 with EcoRI and PstI and isolating the vector. The isolated vector was ligated to the EcoRI PstI DNA fragment. This DNA mixture was used to transform pSTII partial was digested with MnlI and BamHI and a 180 bp fragment containing the STII Shine Dalgarno sequence, the STII signal sequence, and the first 30 codons of the mature STII gene was isolated. The 180 bp DNA fragment was ligated to a plasmid containing the trp promoter. One such plasmid, pHGH207 1, has been described previously H. de Boer An M13 phage containing STII encoding sequences was first constructed by ligating the 180 bp XbaI BamHI fragment of pSTII leader into XbaI and BamHI digested M13mp10. The resulting phage DNA, pSTII shuttle, was characterized by restriction endonuclease analysis and nucleotide sequencing. LT encoding sequences were then introduced into this vector by ligating the HpaI EcoRI 700 bp fragment of pLTtrp1 into SmaI EcoRI digested pSTII shuttle replicative form RF, double stranded DNA SmaI and HpaI sites are both blunt ended and ligated together resulting in the loss of both sites . The resulting phage DNA, M13 STII LT, was characterized and then utilized for mutagenesis as follows the primer 5 p CAAATGCCTATGCACTGCCAGGCGTAGG was kinased and mixed with the template M13 STII LT in the presence of ligase buffer and XbaI EcoRI digested M13mp10 RF DNA to promote priming of DNA, as reported by J.P. Adelman Purified lymphoblastoid lymphotoxin obtained in Example 1 was dialyzed against phosphate buffered saline PBS . 200 µg of lymphotoxin ml were contained in the dialysate. Glutaraldehyde was added to the dialysate to a concentration of 70mM glutaraldehyde, the mixture incubated for 2 hours at room temperature, more glutaraldehyde added to bring its total added concentration up to 140 mM, incubation continued for another 6 hours and the mixture then dialyzed against PBS. 50 µg of the glutaraldehyde cross linked lymphotoxin hereafter, polylymphotoxin and 0.5 ml of Freund s complete adjuvant was injected subcutaneously into mice strain BALB c . After one week, the mouse was booster immunized with 50 µg of polylymphotoxin and 0.5 ml of Freund s incomplete adjuvant, half intramuscularly and half into the peritoneal cavity. Serum was harvested after 7 days and assayed for anti lymphotoxin activity by an ELISA assay. The ELISA assay was conducted as follows A buffered solution of purified lymphotoxin was placed in microtiter wells and permitted to coat the wells with about 100 ng of lymphotoxin each. The unadsorbed lymphotoxin solution was aspirated from the wells. 50 µl of appropriately diluted test sample was combined with 100 µl PBS containing 5 mg ml bovine serum albumin PBS BSA buffer and added to each well, incubated for 2 hours at room temperature, washed with PBS containing 0.05 percent Tween 20, 100 µl of horse radish peroxidase labelled goat anti mouse IgG in PBS BSA buffer added to each well and incubated for 1 hour. Each well was washed with PBS containing 0.05 percent Tween 20 and then citrate phosphate buffer, pH5, containing 0.1 mg Test samples also were assayed for the ability to neutralize the cytolytic activity of lymphotoxin in the murine L929 assay. Serum harvested from immunized animals or hybridoma supernatants were diluted as required into RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 percent fetal bovine serum and about 100 lymphotoxin units ml and plated into microtiter wells containing cultured L929 cells as is otherwise conventional in the cytolysis assay. In the control, all cells were lysed. Neutralizing antibody was detected by failure of the lymphotoxin to lyse L929 cells. The animal immunized with glutaraldehyde polymerized lymphotoxin raised antibodies which were active in the ELISA assay, but no serum neutralizing activity was detected. A suspension containing 100 µg lymphotoxin and 1 ml of a 1.64 percent w v suspension of aluminum hydroxide Al OH ₃ was prepared and used to immunize the same mouse. The mouse was injected with 100 µl of the suspension intramuscularly and 400 µl intraperitoneally. After one week the mouse was injected intravenously with 10 µg of unpolymerized and unadsorbed lymphoblastoid lymphotoxin in 100 µl of PBS. A test of a 1 80 dilution of the animal s serum three days later indicated the presence lymphotoxin neutralizing antibody. The spleen from this animal was harvested. 3x10⁷ spleen cells were fused with 5x10⁷ murine myeloma cells and plated into microtiter wells containing HAT medium and about 3000 peritoneal macrophages microtiter well according to the procedure of S. Fazekas De St. Groth, 1980, J. Immunol. Meth. The method of Example 3 is followed exactly in this example except that segment 6 of the synthetic oligonucleotide was modified to have the sequence 5 CTCAACTCTGCACCCA3 and its complementary strand segment 53 modified to have the sequence 3 AGACGTGGGTCGTCGT5 . The modified oligonucleotides are annealed to the remaining oligonucleotides and ligated into the expression vector as described in Example 6. This vector contains a 2 bp substitution which changed the lysine 28 codon from lysine to histidine. The histidine mutant is expressed upon transformation of Other site directed mutants are prepared in the same fashion, preferably selecting codons so as to not introduce an EcoRI restriction site that would require the use of a partial EcoRI restriction digest in the digestion of pLTXB1 called for in Example 3. Nor should the mutations introduce additional XbaI or BamHI sites into Fragment A see Fig. 1b , BamHI or HindIII sites into Fragment B or HindIII or BglII sites into Fragment C. Otherwise, partial digestions will be required to properly assemble the pLTXB1 mutant digestion to completion would yield a deletion mutant rather than the substitution mutant that is the objective in this case. The murine and bovine lymphotoxin genes were isolated from genomic λ libraries. The human lymphotoxin cDNA fragment PvuII EcoRI, 600bp was radiolabeled with ³²P by nick translation and used as a probe to screen a murine genomic DNA λ library M600 strain murine genomic DNA in λCharon4A, T. Maniatis Plasmid pLTtrp1 is digested with Xba1 in order to open the plasmid at the Xba1 site just proximal to the lymphotoxin start codon. The Xba1 cohesive terminii are blunted by the Klenow fragment of is ligated to the blunted plasmid fragment, the protruding 5 hydroxyl terminii phosphorylated using polynucleotide kinase, the ligation mixture used to transform Plasmid pFRPn EP 60,057A is digested with EcoR1, treated with alkaline phosphatase to prevent recircularization, ligated to the SP lymphotoxin fragment using T4 DNA ligase and the ligation mixture then used to transform λLT11 Example 2 is digested with EcoR1 and the lymphotoxin containing DNA fragment the reverse transcript recovered. Plasmid pEHER EP 117,060A is digested with EcoR1, treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and ligated to the EcoR1 linkered reverse transcript of λLT11. The resulting plasmids grown on Tissue culture cells are transfected by mixing 1 µg of pEHERLT I or pEHERLT II as prepared above with 10 µg rat carrier DNA in a volume of 250 µl, 0.25 M CaCl₂, followed by dropwise addition of 250 µl HEPES buffered saline 280 mM MaCl, 1.5 mM Na₂PO₄, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.1 . After 30 minutes at room temperature, the solution is added to tissue culture cells growing in 60 mm plastic tissue culture dishes. CHO 1, CHO DHFR DUX B11, and Ltk cells are used. The dishes contain 3 ml culture medium appropriate to the host cell. For CHO 1 and CHO DHFR DUX B11 cells, the medium is Ham F 12 media Gibco supplemented with 10 percent calf serum, 100 µ ml penicillin 100 µg ml streptomycin, and 2 µmM L glutamine. For the Ltk cell line, the medium is Dulbecco modified Eagle s medium DMEM supplemented as above. After 3 16 hours, the medium is removed and the cells are washed with 20 percent glycerol in phosphate buffered saline. Fresh medium is added to each plate and the cells are incubated for 2 more days. Selection of transfected host cells is carried out by trypsinizing the cells after 2 days growth which comprises treating the cells with sterile trypsin 0.5 mg ml containing 0.2 mg ml EDTA and adding about 3x10⁵ cells to 10 mm tissue culture plates with selective media. For dhfr cells the medium is a formulation of F 12 GIBCO medium lacking glycine, hypoxanthine, and thymidine GHT medium . For DHFR host cells, methotrexate 100 1000 nM is added to the normal growth medium. Controls are run using transfection conditions with no plasmid and with plasmid pFD 11 EP 117,060A containing normal DHFR. Colonies arising from cells which take up and express the DHFR plasmid are apparent within 1 2 weeks. Transformants are identified that express mature lymphotoxin.
