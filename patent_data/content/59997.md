# Butter flavored fat or oil.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein is a buttery flavor system for use in shortenings and oils which remains balanced in both aroma and flavor throughout the use cycle. An authentic buttery aroma is perceived on opening the can, an authentic buttery flavor is apparent on tasting the oil, and the aroma and flavor remain apparent during cooking, and in the finished food. The composition uses butter flavor components in both an unencapsulated form and encapsulated in a water soluble material.
