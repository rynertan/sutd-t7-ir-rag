# Heat recovery from concentrated sulfuric acid.

## Abstract
In a process for the recovery of heat from concentrated sulfuric acid, sulfur trioxide is absorbed into hot concen trated sulfuric acid having a concentration greater than 98 and less than 101 and a temperature greater than 120 C. in an absorption zone 61 in a heat recovery tower 60 and the heat created by the exothermic reaction is recovered in a useful form in a heat exchanger 62 .
