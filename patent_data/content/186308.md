## Description
This invention relates to an expandable polyetherimide composition. More particularly, it relates to an expandable composition which gives a useful polyetherimide foam which is excellent in heat resistance and non flammability, does not emit harmful smoke and flames even in a fire, and is useful as a heat insulating material and a shock absorbing material, and to a formed material obtained therefrom. As to heat insulating materials and shock absorbing materials excellent in heat resistance, there have been hitherto known foamed materials of various heat resistant polymers, for example that of poly 2,6 dimethylphenylen oxide U.S. Patent No. 3,492,249 and those of polysulfone, polyarylsulfone and polyethersulfone Japanese Patent Application Kokoku Past Exam Publn No. 36004 83 . However, these heat resistant resins are essentially flammable and moreover emit a large amount of smoke in a fire. Accordingly, they cannot be used as interior finish materials of aeroplanes, vehicles and motorcars. Besides the above mentioned foamed materials, there have been also proposed polyimide foam Japanese Patent Application Kokai Laid Open No. 145222 84 and heat resistant foamed materials formed of resins having a glass transition point of 140 C or higher Japanese Patent Application Kokai Laid Open No. 36139 84 . However, though the former is excellent in heat resistance and substantially emits no harmful smoke and flame, it has drawbacks in that it requires the use of expensive raw materials and moreover gives final products of high moisture absorption. On the other hand, the latter has defects in that it has a open cell content resulting in a poor heat insulating property, and moreover has poor mechanical strength and shock absorbing property. Thus, they are both not satisfactory as heat resistant foamed material. GB 2,134,527 discloses foamed plastics material having a high resistance to melting, burning and slumping and producing less toxic smoke which is produced from a thermoplastic polymer such as polyethersulfone, polysulfone, polyetherimide and the like. However, the foamed plastics material is formed with help of a cross linking agent so as to give said properties to the foamed material. The present invention results from a need to provide a polyetherimide foam which can overcome the difficulties of the above prior art. In particular, there is a need for a foam which is excellent in heat resistance and non flammability, does not substantially emit harmful smoke and flames even in fires, is excellent in such mechanical properties as heat insulating property and compressive strength, chemical durability such as resistance to high temperature moisture, shock absorbing property, and has a closed cell content not less than 60 preferably not less than 80 , and a expandable composition which can give the foam. After extensive studies the present inventors have found that a composition comprising a polyetherimide and an organic blowing agent containing a specified amount of a specified volatile organic compound can overcome the above mentioned difficulties, and have accomplished this invention based on the finding. Thus, according to this invention, there is provided an expandable polyetherimide composition comprising A 100 parts by weight of a polyetherimide and B from 5 to 40 parts by weight of a volatile blowing agent and no cross linking agent, wherein said volatile blowing agent contains at least 10 by weight of a volatile organic foaming component having a solubility parameter δ The invention also provides a foamed material obtainable from said composition and which has a density of 0.4 to 0.02 g cm³ and closed cell content of not less than 60 . The polyetherimide used in the composition of this invention can be produced by known methods U.S. Patent No. 3,803,085, 3,838,097, 3,847,867, 3,983,093, 3,989,670, 3,991,004 and 4,293,683 . For example there can be used polyetherimides which consist essentially of the chemically combined units shown by the general formula wherein R being a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group or an alkoxy group or a divalent radical containing the units shown by the formula wherein X is C O or S , wherein Q is O , CO , S or C These polyetherimides have in general a solubility parameter δ For example, a polyetherimide used in this invention can be given as follows and having a solubility parameter of 10.76, a glass transition point of 216 to 222 C, and a thermal decomposition temperature of 535 C and having a solubility parameter of 10.87 and a glass transition point of 121 C and having a solubility parameter of 11.1 and a glass transition point of 202 C and having a solubility parameter of 10.75, a glass transition point of 196 to 221 C, and a thermal decomposition temperature of 410 to 420 C and one consisting of the following chemically combined units and having a solubility parameter of 10.76, a glass transition point of 237 C, and a thermal decomposition temperature of 430 C. Besides these polyetherimides, there can be optionally used in this invention products obtained by capping the molecular chain terminal groups of these polyetherimides with phthalic anhydride, copolymers wherein at least one of the acid component the ether component O Z O and the amine component R in the above mentioned general formula I consists of two or more kinds of radicals, or blended products of these polymers, or further as desired, blended products of these polymers with another polymer. These polyetherimides are used after properly selected to have suitable characteristics for intended purposes. For example, when used as a structural material or heat insulating material for high temperatures the polyetherimide has preferably a high glass transition point of 200 C or higher, whereas when a foamed material excellent in shock absorbing property is to be obtained it has preferably a glass transition point of lower than 140 C. When a foamed material is formed by extrusion foaming, it is advantageous to use a mixture comprising 10 to 90 by weight of a resin having a glass transition point of 200 C or higher and 90 to 10 by weight of a resin having a glass transition point of lower than 140 C, since the foamed material obtained has a good surface appearance and a good state of surface layer cells. Further, resins which have a thermal decomposition temperature at which the weight loss by heating reaches 5 of 300 C or higher are advantageous in that they give a smaller amount of smoke in a fire. The blowing agent used in the composition of this invention should contain at least 10 by weight of a volatile organic foaming component having a solubility parameter δ The term blowing agent of the present invention may also contain a mixture of compounds and or agents having blowing properties. The reason why a volatile organic foaming component which has a dielectric constant in a specified range in addition to a solubility parameter in a specified range is particularly excellent as a blowing agent and gives a foamed material of closed cells in this invention is not definitely clear. However, it is presumably because owing to the interaction of such a component with the polar group of said polyetherimide, the viscoelasticity and the elongation characteristic of the expandable composition come to fall within a range suitable for foaming process. The above mentioned volatile organic foaming component should have a boiling point of not higher than 80 C at normal pressure. A component having the boiling point of higher than 80 C is unfavorable since it tends to develop cracks at the cell wall when the pressure in the cell becomes negative during the cooling step conducted immediately after foaming. The volatile organic foaming component of this invention has preferably a solubility parameter δ A foaming component which has a δ Further, a foaming component which has a boiling point of not higher than 65 C at normal pressure is favorable in that it gives foamed materials of smooth surface in expansion forming of board or cylinder shaped products and further permits an easy forming. The volatile organic foaming component used in this invention is a mixture of at least one member selected from the following group A with at least one member selected from the following group B. As to specific examples of the volatile organic foaming component of this invention there may be mentioned, for instance when polyetherimide is the one obtained from 2,2 bis 4 3,4 dicarboxyphenoxy phenyl propane dianhydride and m phenylenediamine Ultem 1000, a trade name, mfd. by General Electric Co., Ltd., Solubility parameter 10.76 , methylene chloride ethanol weight ratio 74 26 to 38 62 , ethyl chloride methanol weight ratio 78 22 to 53 47 , 1,1 dichloroethane methanol weight ratio 85.6 14.4 to 58 42 , methyl chloride methanol weight ratio 86.7 13.3 to 59 41 , methylene chloride methanol weight ratio 81.9 18.1 to 67.1 32.9 , methyl ethyl ketone methanol weight ratio 94.2 5.8 to 51 49 , acetone methanol weight ratio 100 0 to 57 43 and acetone water weight ratio 100 0 to 82.5 17.5 . The blowing agent used in this invention may be the volatile organic foaming component specified above used alone or a mixture containing at least 10 by weight of said volatile organic component. Examples of other blowing agents which can be used to form the above mentioned mixture include those which do not dissolve the polyetherimide, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, trichlorofluoromethane, trichlorotrifluoroethane, butane, pentane, and carbon tetrachloride. When the volatile organic foaming component of this invention is used in the form of a blowing agent mixture, the content of the former in said mixture should be at least 10 by weight as mentioned above. When the content is less than 10 by weight, uniform impregnation or mixing of the blowing agent with polyetherimide is difficult, foaming takes place with difficulty, and foamed products of closed cells cannot be obtained. The proportion of the organic blowing agent and polyetherimide used in the composition of this invention is generally 5 to 40 parts by weight of the organic blowing agent relative to 100 parts by weight of polyetherimide. The preferable amount of the organic blowing agent to be used is selected properly depending on the properties required for the foamed material to be obtained, the intended density of the material, and other factors. The composition of this invention can assume any desired form including powders, granules and sheets. The preparation of the composition can be conducted by conventional methods, for example one which comprises bringing a gaseous or liquid organic blowing agent into contact with powdery or granular polyetherimide to effect impregnation or one which comprises heating and melting polyetherimide in a melt processing machine such as an extruder, then injecting the organic blowing agent into it under pressure and mixing them uniformly. The production of foamed materials using the expandable polyetherimide composition of this invention can be conducted by known methods, which include, for example, a method which comprises contacting the said composition with steam, heated oil or heated air stream to effect foaming, and filling the foamed granules thus obtained in a mould followed by heating to form the intended product one which comprises filling the said composition in a pressure mould and then conducting expansion moulding in the mold or one which comprises melting the said composition under pressure in an extruder, then cooling it down to a temperature appropriate for foaming, and extruding it into a region of atmospheric or low pressure to effect forming. Among these methods, the one which comprises feeding the expandable polyetherimide composition to an extruder and then extruding it to effect foaming is particularly preferable in that it enables industrial, continuous production of foamed materials of uniform quality. A formed board material having a large sectional area useful as the core material of a light weight composite panel can be produced by this method. The foamed material obtained from the expandable composition of this invention can be in the form of a cylindrical column, square pillar, cylinder, sheet, board, or block, and also a more complicated profile or moulded article, and thus can be produced in various forms depending on intended uses. Particularly, those of the form of cylindrical column, cylinder or board are useful for using, after combined with plastics, filler reinforced plastics, fiber reinforced plastics, metal plates, or other inorganic sheet material on their surface to form a composite material, as machine parts such as robot arms and exterior panels of machines as materials for interior walls, ceilings and floors or seat backboards and the like, of aeroplanes, vehicles and motorcars and, after being moulded while the said composite is being prepared, e.g. as ski boards and reflector boards of parabolic antenna. The cell structure of these foamed materials may be either isotropic one or anistropic one elongated in one or two directions. However, when the foamed material is used in a composite interior panel for aeroplanes, vehicles and motorcars, it has preferably an anisotropic cell structure obtained by elongating the cell unidirectionally in the direction of the thickness of foamed material to increase the compressive strength in the thickness direction. For composite panels, there can be used a foamed material which has a skin layer containing thin film of substantially unexpanded polyetherimide formed on its surface of the panel surface side or one obtained by slicing the above mentioned skin layer off to expose a cellular cross section. In the latter case wherein the skin layer is sliced off, the average diameter of cells appearing on the cross section is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 3 mm because then an excellent adhesive strength can be obtained. The density of the foamed material obtainable from the composition of this invention can be selected as desired depending on intended uses. However, considering the original purpose of using a foamed material, it is usually selected in the range of 0.4 to 0.02 g cm³, preferably 0.2 to 0.03 g cm³, in view of light weight, rigidity and processability. The composition of this invention may be incorporated, as desired, with additives conventionally used in foamed materials, such as coloring agents, inorganic fillers, antioxidants, lubricants, cell controlling agents, and antistatic agents. The solubility parameters of volatile organic compound referred to in this invention are values described in Brandrup et al., Polymer Handbook, 2nd. Edition, IV, pp. 337 to 359, or where not described therein are calculated by the method of Hoy in Journal of Paint Technology, The solubility parameter of a mixture was calculated from the equation The dielectric constant is the ratio of electric capacity C The expandable polyetherimide composition of this invention uses as an organic blowing agent those containing a volatile organic compound having a solubility parameter, a dielectric constant, and a boiling point each in a specified range. The polyetherimide foamed material obtained from said composition has a closed cell content of at least 60 , preferably at least 80 , is excellent in heat resistance and non flammability, does not emit substantially harmful smoke and flames even in a fire, and further excellent in such mechanical properties as heat insulating property and compressive strength, chemical durability such as resistance to high temperature moisture, and shock absorbing property. Consequently, it is very useful as heat insulating materials and shock absorbing materials. Particularly, foam materials having a density in the range of 0.4 to 0.02 g cm³, preferably 0.2 to 0.03 g cm³, a closed cell content of not lower than 60 , preferably not lower than 80 , and an average cell diameter in the range of 0.1 to 3 mm, preferably 0.15 to 2 mm, are extremely useful as the core material for light weight laminated panels and composite materials. This invention will be explained in more detail below with reference to Examples. In the Examples, the porperties of formed materials were evaluated by the following methods. A granular polyetherimide ULTEM 1000, a trade name, mfd. by General Electric Co. obtained from 2,2 bis 4 3,4 dicarboxyphenoxy phenyl propane dianhydride and m phenylenediamine and having a solubility parameter of 10.76 and a volatile blowing agent of composition listed in Table 1 were placed in a pressure vessel and heated at 70 C for 16 hours to impregnate the blowing agent into the polyetherimide. The expandable polyetherimide composition obtained was heated by steam to obtain foamed granules having an excellent cushioning property. The properties of the foamed materials obtained are shown in Table 1. When the expandable compositions of Examples 5 and 7 are allowed to stand in the air for one week before use, they come to give only foamed materials of extremely small 0.1 mm or less cell diameter instead of the products shown in Table 1. When a steel plate is bonded to the surface of these small cell diameter foamed materials, peeling takes place at the bonded surface, and only a laminated panel of smaller flatwise adhesive strength is obtained as compared with other foamed materials. Expandable polyetherimide compositions were obtained and then heated by steam to obtain foamed granules in the same manner as in Example 1 except for using as the blowing agent methyl ethyl ketone, ethyl chloride, 1,1,1 trichloroethane, chloroform, benzene, isopropanol, methyl chloride and methylene chloride, respectively. The properties of the foamed granules obtained are shown in Table 2. As is apparent from Tables 1 and 2, the expandable polyetherimide compositions obtained by using a blowing agent comprising at least 10 by weight of volatile organic foaming component having properties specified in this invention, namely a solubility parameter in the range of 9.62 to 11.9, a dielectric constant of not less than 15 and a boiling point of not higher than 80 C expand uniformly to 10 times the original volume or more and the resulting foamed materials have a closed cell content of not less than 60 , or even not less than 80 , whereas those obtained by using a blowing agent containing essentially other volatile organic compounds give either unhomogeneous foamed materials or foamed materials which, though homogeneous, is deficient in closed cells and of a poor quality. Particularly, the compositions which contain volatile organic foaming component having a solubility parameter in the range of 9.86 to 11.66 i.e., δ To pellets obtained by impregnating 0.61 part by weight of water to 100 parts by weight of a polyetherimide Ultem 1000, a trade name, mfd. by General Electric Co. , was impregnated 26 parts by weight of a mixed blowing agent, dichlorotetrafluoroethane methylene chloride weight ratio 82 18 , to obtain an expandable polyetherimide composition. The composition thus obtained was made to expand by heating it at 150 C for 60 seconds. The foamed material obtained had a density of 0.06 g cm³ and a closed cell content of 80 . The solubility parameter of the methylene chloride water mixture system in the above mentioned composition is 11.8. A polyetherimide composition was obtained in the same manner as in Example 9 except for using polyetherimide pellets which have been dried by heating then at 180 C for 16 hours. The composition obtained was expanded by heating it at 150 C for 60 seconds. The resulting foamed material had a density of 0.06 g cm³ and a closed cell content of 30 . Expandable compositions were obtained in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the blowing agents listed in Table 3 were respectively used for impregnation. When the impregnated amount is insufficient at heating conditions of 70 C and 16 hours, the temperature as well as the time was increased to obtain the intended expandable composition. The expandable composition thus obtained was heated by steam to obtain foamed granules. The properties of the foamed granules obtained are shown in Table 3. As is apparent from the Table 3, the foamed granules were of uniform and high ratio expansion and had a closed cell content of 80 or more. Expandable compositions were obtained and foamed granules were prepared therefrom in the same manner as in Example 1 except for using the blowing agents listed in Table 3, respectively. The properties of the foamed granules are shown in Table 3. As is apparent from the Table, the foamed granules had a high open cell content and were of poor quality. An expandable composition obtained by impregnating previously 100 parts by weight of a polyetherimide Ultem 1000, a trade name, mfd. by General Electric Co. with 9 parts by weight of acetone was supplied to an extrusion foaming apparatus comprising an extruder having a bore diameter of 40 mm and L D of 24 fitted at its head with a slit nozzle having an opening gap of 0.804 mm and an opening width of 5.2 mm, and melted at 210 C. Then, 1 part by weight of dichlorotetrafluoroethane per 100 parts by weight of the resin was pressed into the apparatus through a blowing agent injecting apparatus attached to the outlet side of the extruder. The composition was mixed uniformly and extruded through the nozzle cooled at 195 to 198 C into the air to effect forming. The extruded material was holded down, while being foamed, from its upper and lower sides with forming plates attached to the extrusion nozzle to obtain a foamed material formed in a board. The foamed board material obtained had a thickness of 12 mm, a width of 40 mm, a density of 0.048 g cm³, a closed cell content of 98 , an average cell diameter in the thickness direction of 1.6 mm, an average cell diameter in the board surface of 1.1 mm, and a compresive strength in the thickness direction 686 kPa 7 kg cm² 10 strain . Then, the skin layers of both sides of the foamed material were sliced off to expose cellular cross sections. To the both sides of the foamed board thus obtained, were bonded under a pressure of 3 kg cm² steel plates 0.3 mm thick to which an epoxy resin adhesive had been applied. The resulting laminated panel had a flatwise tensile strength of 19.0 kg cm². An extruded foamed board was prepared in a similar manner to that in Reference Example 1 except that talc was added to the expandable composition impregnated with acetone. The amount of talc and that of dichlorotetrafluoroethane injected were varied to obtain foamed boards having an average cell diameter shown in Table 4, a density of 0.052 to 0.056 g cm³ and a closed cell content of 81 to 86 . The laminated panels prepared in the same manner as in Reference Example 1 had a flatwise tensile strength shown in Table 4. A foamed material having an average cell diameter of 0.09 mm was obtained in the same manner as in Reference Example 2 but by increasing the amount of talc further. Separately, a foamed material having an average cell diameter of 5 mm was obtained in the same manner as in Reference Example 1 except that no dichlorotetrafluoroethane was injected. The laminated panels prepared from these foamed materials in the same manner as in Reference Example 1 had properties shown in Table 4. Table 4 shows that foamed materials having an average cell diameter of 0.1 mm to 3 mm at the surface are more excellent in flatwise tensile strength. A polyetherimide was prepared from 2,2 bis 4 3,4 dicarboxyphenoxy phenyl propane dianhydride and hexamethylene diamine with reference to Example 7 described in U.S. Patent No. 3,847,867. The product obtained had a glass transition point of 121 C, an intrinsic viscosity of 0.40 as determined in a methylene chloride solution, and a solubility parameter of 10.88 as calculated by the method of Hoy. The polymer was fed to an extruder of 30 mm bore diameter and heated at 200 C to be molten. Twenty one parts by weight of an acetone dichlorotetrafluoroethane mixture weight ratio 80 20 per 100 parts by weight of the polymer were fed through a blowing agent injecting apparatus provided on the outlet side of the extruder. The whole was uniformly molten and mixed to give an expandable composition. Then, the expandable composition was cooled down to 140 C through a cooling apparatus connected to the outlet of the extruder, and extruded through a nozzle attached to the end of the cooling apparatus into the air to effect foaming. The foamed material obtained was in the form of a cylindrical column with a diameter of about 30 mm, was uniform, and had a density of 0.032 g cm³ and a closed cell content of 95 . The polyetherimide used in Example 1 and the one used in Reference Example 4 were blended in a ratio of 80 20 by weight, and then treated in the same manner as in Reference Example 4 to obtain an expandable polyetherimide composition. The composition was then extruded under atmospheric pressure to effect foaming. Thus, a homogeneous foamed material was obtained which had a density of 0.081 g cm³, a closed cell content of 96 , and a compressive strength of 1568 kPa 16 kg cm² . The material had a smooth surface and uniformly distributed cells.
