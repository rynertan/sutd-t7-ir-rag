# FORCED TRANSPORT MOLECULAR GAS LASER

## Abstract
A forced transport, electrically excited molecular gas laser is disclosed. The laser includes a flow path for a gaseous lasing medium at high pressure such as 50 to 150 Torr, a blower for moving the gaseous lasing medium at high speed along the flow path, electrodes for electrically exciting the moving gaseous lasing medium along an active discharge length of the flow path to create a plasma for lasing, and an expansion chamber along the flow path in the vicinity of the active discharge length of the flow path for rapidly expanding the moving gaseous lasing medium to stir the plasma and provide a more uniform and stable dis charge. The gas laser allows for high pressure and fast axial flow operation resulting in a compact design which produces high power optical output with uniform and stable mode characteristics.
