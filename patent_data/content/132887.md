# Device for drawing an optical fibre.

## Abstract
An improved sealing of the inlet channel of a drawing furnace 38 for optical fibres 32 can be achieved by using one or more silicone rubber discs 42 having an aperture whose diameter is smaller than that of the preform 26 . Burning of the silicone rubber discs 42 can be checked by choosing a material for the discs 42 having a refractive index smaller than that of the preform 26 so that thermal radiation is not irradiated in the disc 42 via the preform 26 . The silicone rubber discs 42 are further protected by a metal screening 44 between the discs 42 and the interior of the drawing furnace 38 .
