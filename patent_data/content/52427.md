# Surface modifying coating compositions.

## Abstract
Coating compositions suitable for application to optical surfaces to reduce surface misting and light reflection without creating haze comprise a an inorganic particulate component selected from colloidal silica particles, colloidal alumina particles, or a mixture thereof wherein the silica or alumina particles have a small particle size represented by an average particle size in the range 7 to 50 nm and the particles comprise 0.5 to 2.5 weight volume of the total composition b another inorganic particulate component also selected from colloidal silica particles, colloidal alu mina particles, or a mixture thereof wherein the silica and alumina particles have a large particle size represented by an avereage particle size in the range 75 to 150 nm and the particles comprise 0.2 to 1.0 weight volume of the total composition c 0.1 to 1.0 weight volume of a polymeric binder and d a volatile liquid medium. The coating compositions provide especially beneficial properties when applied to thermoplastic films and sheets, such as polyethylene terephthalate films. Such films are suitable as coverings or claddings for horticultural growing houses, cold frames and cloches.
