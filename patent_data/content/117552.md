# AN IMPROVED DIAMOND ROTATING BIT

## Abstract
An improved rotating diamond bit for earth boring is de vised by incorporating generally triangular, prismatically shaped synthetic polycrystalline diamond elements 12 in the teeth 10 of the boring bit. The elements 12 are set on lands 14 defined on the bit face such that two opposing triangular faces 22 of the element 12 form a dehedral an gle in the direction 30 of travel of the element 12 defined by the bit rotation. In other words, the normal 26 to the par allel opposing triangular faces 22 of the diamond element 12 is acutely inclined with respect to the direction 30 of travel of the element 12 . A shoulder to gage transition pat tern of the junk slot, waterway 16 and collector 18 is ar ranged to uniformly distribute the flow of fluid across the shoulder to guage transition. Further, the distribution of fluid from the central conduit within the longitudinal core of the bit to a plurality of nozzles which merge with corres ponding waterways on the bit face is arranged such that fluid is preferentially delivered to a radially innermost noz zle and thereafter in a graduated series of steps in lesser amounts to a series of sequenced nozzles more radially dis posed from the center of the rotating bit.
