# Frequency independent antenna.

## Abstract
An antenna is disclosed that is especially useful for radiating and receiving non sinusoidal electromagnetic waves. The antenna is an efficient and distortion free radiation of electromagnetic pulses that do not use a sinusoid al carrier. The antenna s size is independent of frequency and the antenna, therefore, can be of small size relative to the wavelength of the radiated electromagnetic waves. When used for recepton of electromagnetic wave energy, the antenna performs with low distortion. The basic concept underlying the invention is the modification of the Hertzian electric dipole into an antenna structure that can carry large currents without requiring a large driving voltage. Antennas for the transmission or reception of sinusoidal waves achieve that goal by employing resonant structures. The invention achieves the same result by changing the Hertzian electric dipole into a loop that forms a Hertzian magnetic dipole and preventing the undesirable magnetic dipole radiation by shields of conducting and absorbing materials.
