# METHOD OF AND BURNER FOR BURNING SOLID FUEL

## Abstract
For combustion of solid fuel a cylindrically shaped burner, having an outer casing 10 and an inner casing 12 , is used. The burner rotates about its principal axis, and is arranged so that solid fuel fed in is moved along its length as it rotates. Air is introduced into the burner through parts 20 in the inner casing 12 at least where the fuel congregates during rotation, so that the air passes through the fuel inside the burner.
