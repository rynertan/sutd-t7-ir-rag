## Description
The present invention relates to an adaptive comb filter for deriving a luminance signal commonly referred to as the Y signal and a chrominance signal commonly referred to as the C signal from a color television signal such as an NTSC color television signal separately in a digital manner by A D conversion of a color television signal. A technique of this type is known from US A 4141035. A signal sequence S i,j , for 1 1,2,3 ... m and j 1,2,3 ... n, obtained by digitizing an analog NTSC signal is shown in Fig. 1. A sampling frequency f For the usual television signal, there is a strong correlation between adjacent samples in both the vertical and horizontal directions in one field. Furthermore, in the NTSC system in which interlaced scanning is performed, the phase of the C signal is reversed every line, that is, the polarity of C changes every two samples as shown in Fig. 2. Taking advantage of this property, it is possible to separate the Y signal and the C signal from the NTSC signal in a digital manner. Fig. 3 shows the construction of a conventional Y and C signal separating comb filter. In Fig. 3, the filter includes an A D converter 1 for digitizing the analog NTSC signal on a line 101, a vertical filter 2 for deriving from an output of the A D converter 1 on a line 102 a line alternating signal In operation, the analog NTSC signal on the line 101 is digitized by being sampled by the A D converter 1 with a predetermined sampling frequency f Fig. 4 shows the vertical filter 2 in detail. The filter 2 includes a pair of series connected line buffer memories 6, each delaying the input signal on the line 102 by a period of one line, an adder 7 for summing the output of the A D converter 1 and an output of the second of the line buffer memories 6, a multiplier 8 for multiplying an output of the adder 7 by 1 4, a multiplier 9 for multiplying the output of a first of the line buffer memories 6 by 1 2, and a subtractor 10 for obtaining a difference between outputs of the multipliers 8 and 9. In the vertical filter 2, in order to obtain a line alternating signal H The signal H As a result, the vertical, low frequency component of the Y signal for the sample S i,j is removed. The H In the conventional YC separation comb filter constructed as above, if the video information component of the color television signal varies strongly in the horizontal direction, the energy of the horizontal high frequency component of the Y signal becomes predominant. Therefore, a portion of the horizontal high frequency component of the Y signal still remains in the H Further, an NTSC composite color television signal S in a composite signal composed of a luminance signal Y and a chrominance signal C obtained by quadrature two level phase modulation of two color difference signals U and V or I and Q with a color subcarrier frequency f On the other hand, the PAL composite color television signal P can be represented by Representing the frame frequency, the field frequency and the horizontal scanning frequency by f It is necessary, as mentioned above, in a television receiver to separate correctly the luminance signal Y and the chrominance signal C from a composite color television signal containing color signal which is frequency multiplied to obtain compatibility with a monochromatic television signal such that spectrum thereof is frequency interleaved in the luminance signal region. Fig. 7 shows the construction of another conventional YC signal separating filter for realizing the above separations. In Fig. 7, reference numerals B 1, B 2, B 3 and B 4 depict a one line delay circuit, a vertical filter, a horizontal filter and a subtractor, respectively. The operation of this filter, used for NTSC composite color television signal separation, will be described. The composite color television input signal on a line B 101, which is sampled in synchronism with the color subcarrier with a sampling frequency f As to the operation of the filter for a PAL composite color television signal, the composite color television input signal sampled in synchronism with the color subcarrier with sampling frequency f In this conventional luminance chrominance separating filter, the fixed vertical filter and the horizontal filter are combined, with the assumption that adjacent image elements in the sampled television signal are similar to each other. However, if this is not the case, the luminance signal and the chrominance signal will interfere with one another, particularly in a region in which the luminance and chrominance of the image vary strongly, resulting in distortions in the reproduced image such as color fading and indistinct boundaries. Another digital filter of the prior art used for the NTSC system is shown in Fig. 8. In this figure, C 1 is a vertical filter, C 2 is a band pass filter, and C 3 is a subtractor. The vertical filter C 1 is composed of a vertical filter operation circuit C 10 and one line delay circuits C 11 and C 12. C 101 to C 106 indicate signal lines. Here, it is presumed that the signal S indicated in the equation above is input to the signal line C 101 as the digitized signal S as shown in Fig. 1. Thus, the signal S m,n is present on the signal line C 102 as the output of the one line delay circuit C 11, while the signal S m,n 1 is present on the signal line C 103 as an output of the one line delay circuit C 12. The operation circuit C 10 executes the operations of Values of Y and C are assumed respectively to be Y₀ ΔY₁,C₀ ΔC₁ , Y₀,C₀ and Y₀ ΔY₂,C₀ ΔC₂ for the signals of S m,n 1 , S m,n and S m,n 1 . In this case, the values ΔY₁, ΔY₂, ΔC₁ and ΔC₂ are generally very small. Accordingly, H The signal S m 1,n 1 follows the signal S m,n 1 on the signal line C 101. In this case, the output H In this equations, the values ΔC₁, ΔC₂, ΔC₁ , ΔC₂ , ΔY₁, ΔY₂, ΔY₁ and ΔY₂ are generally very small. Values of Y and C are assumed respectively to be Y₀ ΔY₁ ,C₀ ΔC₁ , Y₀ ,C₀ and Y₀ ΔY₂ ,C₀ ΔC₂ for the signals of S m 1,n 1 , S m 1,n and S m 1,n 1 . Namely, the signal S applied to the vertical filter C 1 includes a digitized luminance signal Y and a chrominance signal C, and it is clear from the two equations immediately above that the luminance signal Y is strongly attenuated with respect to the output of the operation circuit C 10. Delays of one sampling period and of one line period are respectively represented as Z ¹ and Z When the signal S is present on the signal line C 101, the signal S delayed by one line period and the signal S delayed two line periods are present on the signal lines C 102 and C 103, respectively. In this case, the transfer function H The bandpass filter C 2 is provided to further attentuate the signal Y still remaining in the output of the vertical C 1. This bandpass filter C 2 is a bandpass digital filter designed to pass signals U and V having a frequency band around the center frequency f The transfer function H The output of the bandpass filter C 2 can be considered as the digital chrominance signal C, and thus A similar filter intended for use with the PAL system can be constructed taking into account the signal characteristics shown in Fig. 6. Namely, operations expressed by the following equation are carried out using an upper two adjacent lines and lower two adjacent lines next to a given line, and result is applied to the signal line C 104 In this prior art system, particularly the vertical filter C 1 is configurated on the assumption that the values of ΔY₁, ΔY₂, ΔY₃, ΔY₄, ΔC₁, ΔC₂, ΔC₁ and Δ C₂ , etc., are small. Therefore, the system of the prior art is accompanied by the disadvantage that the vertical filter will not properly operate as a filter in a region where changes in luminance and chrominance of the picture image portion corresponding to the adjacent horizontal scanning line such as a straight line in the horizontal direction are distinctive, and thereby impurities of color and other disturbances in the picture unavoidably occur. The present invention further relates to a subnyquist sampling filter for recovering a high quality picture signal from a quantized picture signal sampled at a sampling frequency equal to or lower than the nyquist frequency, for example, for high quality digital transmission of television picture signals. An existing subnyquist sampling method wherein a signal is sampled with a sampling frequency lower than the nyquist frequency, will explained referring to Fig. 9. Fig. 9 shows the allocation of a picture signal extracted by subsampling from a series of existing picture signals sampled in the form of a square lattice. In this figure, the maximum frequency of the picture signal is f As described above, a subnyquist sampling method is effective as a method of highly efficient coding to reduce the amount of data during transmission and recording by reducing the number of samples of the picture signal. A prefilter which suppresses loop noise produced by the subnyquist sampling and an interpolation filter which results in less interpolation noise during recovery are required in the subnyquist sampling filter. Fig. 10 is a block diagram indicating an example of a conventional subnyquist sampling system. Figs. 11 and 12, respectively, are block diagrams of a prefilter and an interpolation filter used in the subnyquist sampling system of Fig. 10. In these figures, D 2 and D 10 are A D converters, D 4 is a prefilter, D 6 is a subsampler, D 8 is an interpolation filter, D 12 and D 18 are line delay circuits, D 14 and D 16 are dot delay circuits, D 20 is a low pass filter, D 22 and D 25 are subsample line delay circuits, D 27 is an average value interpolation filter, and D 29 is an interpolation switch. Operations of the subnyquist sampling system of the prior art shown in Fig. 10 will be explained. An analog input picture signal D 1 is sampled at the nyquist sampling frequency f The operations of the prefilter shown in Fig. 11 will now be described. Here, a digital input picture signal D 3 is indicated by S m,n corresponding to the picture element location. When S m,n 1 indicated in Fig. 9 is input to the digital input picture signal D 3 through the line delay circuits D 12 and D 18 and the dot delay circuits D 14 and D 16, a total of five picture signals S m 1,n , S m,n , S m 1,n and S m,n 1 corresponding to D 13, D 15, D 17 and D 18, respectively are output simultaneously. The low pass filter 20 carries out the following equations on the picture signals D 3, D 13, D 15, D 17 and D 19, and also outputs the signal P m,n indicated below as the prefilter output picture signal D 5 for S m,n . The signal P m,n is an output of a two dimensional low pass filter D 20 which suppresses the high frequency components of the signal S m,n which cause loop noise. The operations of the interpolation filter shown in Fig. 12 will be explained hereinafter. The output picture signal P m,n of the prefilter D 4 is reduced to a half in the amount of picture data it contains because of the skipped samplings. A series of samples of the output picture signal D 7, which is the output of subsampler D 6, are sequentially output as P m,n 1 , ..., P m 1,n , P m 1,n , ...., P m,n 1 , .... on a time sequential basis. Accordingly, the picture signal extracted by the subsampler D 6 is recovered by the interpolation filter D 8 as explained below. The subsample line delay circuits D 22 and D 25 and the dot delay circuit D 14 simultaneously output the four picture signals of P m 1,n , P m 1,n and P m,n 1 corresponding to D 23, D 24 and D 26 with such a timing that the signal P m,n 1 of the subsample output picture signal D 7 is input. The average value interpolation filter D 27 recovers the interpolation picture signals Q m,n D 28 indicated below corresponding to the element P m,n by the following processing from the picture signals mentioned above The interpolation switch D 29 alternately selects the subsample output picture signal D 23 and interpolation picture signal D 28 and obtains the recovered picture signals R m,n D 9 as the time series ...., P m,n 1 , ...., Q m 2,n , P m 1,n , Q m,n , P m 1,n ,..., P m,n 1 , ..... The prefilter and interpolation filter in the above subnyquist sampling system are capable of suppressing loop noise by subnyquist sampling, but, on the other hand, they reduce the two dimensional frequency response of the original picture signal to a half. Namely, the existing subnyquist sampling system has a disadvantage that the resolution in each direction of the picture is lowered to about a half of the resolution provided in the original signal. Moreover, it is also possible to employ an interpolation filter which horizontally interpolates a lower frequency component in the horizontal direction and vertically interpolates a higher frequency component in the horizontal direction and a prefilter which is adaptive to such interpolation filter. However, this technique is also accompanied by a disadvantage that only a frequency response in two dimensional space can be obtained as in the case of the existing subnyquist sampling system for frequency components which are high simultaneously in the vertical and horizontal directions. An object of the present invention is to provide a YC separation comb filter having an improved response to local variations of the television signal. According to the invention, there is provided a filter for a digitized composite color television signal, comprising means for determining a direction from a given image point in said composite color television signal in which a minimum amount of change occurs over a predetermined distance and means for performing a filtering operation selected from a plurality of differing filtering operations on said composite colour television signal in response to said determination. Said plurality of filtering operations may include separating a luminance signal and chrominance signal from said colour television signal. Said plurality of filtering operation may include subnyquist filtering of said colour television signal having a portion of the information content thereof removed. Preferably a pair of filters is used for detecting variations of a sample with respect to vertically and horizontally adjacent samples and the better filter is selected for the detected variations. Further in accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a luminance signal chrominance signal separating filter which detects the nature of the composite signal waveform in a limited region and switches between a vertical filter and horizontal filter suitably to correctly separate a luminance information and a chrominance information from the television signal. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, lowering of the filtering effect resulting from sudden changes of picture signal between adjacent elements is prevented by introducing a transversal filter in addition to the vertical filter. Similarities in the vertical direction and in the horizontal direction are detected and compared, and an output of the filter having the higher similarity is selected, taking into account the facts that picture signals for adjacent picture elements in the vertical direction are generally similar, as are picture signals for the adjacent picture elements in the horizontal direction. Still further, the invention provides a subnyquist sampling filter with less loss of picture resolution comprising an adaptive prefilter which performs low pass filter processing on a series of picture signals sampled in the form of a square lattice in the direction where a degree of change of picture a signal level at the periphery of the extracted picture elements is a minimum, and an adaptive interpolation filter which performs interpolation processing on the picture signal obtained by subnyquist sampling with a subsampler the picture signal output from the adaptive prefilter in the direction where the degree of change of the picture signal level at the periphery of the extracted picture elements is a minimum. In Fig. 13, a YC separation comb filter according to the present invention includes an A D converter 1 for converting an analog NTSC signal on a line 101 into a digital signal, a vertical and horizontal adaptive filter 11 for removing the Y signal component from the output of the A D converter 1, a delay element 4 for compensating delay introduced by the vertical and horizontal adaptive filter 11, and a subtractor 5 for deriving a difference between the output of the adaptive filter 11 and the output of the delay element 4. In operation, a digital signal series S i,j obtained from the A D converter 1 is filtered by the adaptive filter 11. The construction of the adaptive filter 11 is shown in Fig. 14. As shown in Fig. 14, the adaptive filter 11 includes a first line buffer memory 6 connected to the output of the A D converter 1 for delaying the output signal of the converter 1 on the line 102 by a time corresponding to one line, a first sample buffer memory 12 connected to the output of the A D converter 1 for delaying the output signal of the converter 1 by a time corresponding to two samples two dots , a second sample buffer memory 12 connected to an output of the first line buffer memory 6 for delaying the output signal of the first line buffer memory 6 on the line 104 by a time corresponding to two samples, a second line buffer memory 6 connected to an output of the second sample buffer memory 12 for delaying an output signal thereof on a line 113 by a time corresponding to one line, a third sample buffer memory 12 connected to the output of the second sample buffer memory 12 for delaying the output signal thereof by a time corresponding to two samples, a first adder 7 for summing outputs of the second line buffer memory 6 and the first sample buffer memory 12, a second adder 7 for summing the outputs of the first line buffer memory 6 and the third sample buffer memory 12, a first multiplier 8 for multiplying an output of the first adder 7 by 1 4, a second multiplier 8 for multiplying an output of the second adder 7 by 1 4, a third multiplier 9 for multiplying an output of the second sample buffer memory 12 by 1 2, a first subtractor 10 for deriving a difference between outputs of first multiplier 8 and the third multiplier 9, a second subtractor 10 for deriving a difference between outputs of the second multiplier 8 and the third multiplier 9, a third subtractor 13 for deriving a difference between the outputs of the first sample buffer memory 12 and second line buffer memory 6, a fourth subtractor 13 for deriving a difference between the outputs of the third sample buffer memory 12 and the first line buffer memory 6, a first absolute value generator 14 for obtaining an absolute value of the output of the third subtractor 13, a second absolute value generator 14 for obtaining an absolute value of the output of the subtractor 13, a comparator 15 for comparing the outputs of the first and second absolute value generators 14, and a switching device 16 responsive to an output of the comparator 15 to pass an output from either the first subtractor 10 or the second subtractor 10 to the line 105. The signal C i,j on the line 105 for the signal S i,j , which is digitized by the A D converter 1, is indicated by a circle with a dot Fig. 15. In order to obtain the value of C i,j , the vertical and horizontal high frequency components T That is, the vertical high frequency component and the horizontal high frequency component of the Y signal for S i,j are obtained using the samples S i,j 1 , S i,j 1 , S 1 2,j and S i 2,j at adjacent phase inverted sample positions of the C signal, and the subsequent filtering operations are performed by using the two of these samples which have the smaller values to remove the low frequency component of the Y signal. Therefore, this adaptive comb filter performs its operations using the samples in the vertical direction when the switch 16 connects the contact 1 and using the samples in the horizontal direction when the switch 16 connects the contact 2 . As a result, the vertical and horizontal Y signal components of the sample S i,j are removed and the signal H The Y signal on the line 107 at this time is obtained by the following calculation as a difference between the output signal of the delay element 4 on the line 106 and the C signal on the line 105 As described hereinbefore, according to this embodiment of present invention, the adaptive filter utilizes the two dimensional characteristics of the image signal and operates corresponding to the one of the vertical and horizontal directions in which the variation is smaller to obtain the separation between the Y and C signals. As a result, there is provided an adaptive comb filter whose response to local variations of the television signal is improved, and hence with which image degradation is minimized. Fig. 16 shows the construction of another embodiment of an adaptive YC signal separating comb filter according to the present invention. In Fig. 16, reference numerals B 5, B 6, B 7, B 8, B 9 and B 10 denote a variable line delay circuit, a dot delay circuit, a vertical separating filter, a horizontal separating filter, a comparator circuit and a selector, respectively. The operation of this embodiment of a separating filter will be described for the case of the NTSC composite color television signal. A sample signal on line B 101 obtained by sampling the composite color television signal with a sampling frequency f The five samples, at a time when the composite color signal S m,n appears on line B 108, are the signal S m,n , signals S m,n 1 and S m,n 1 which are just above and below the signal S m,n and appear on lines B 110 and B 101, respectively, and signals S m 2,n and S m 2,n which are separated horizontally oppositely from the signal S m,n by two samples and appear on lines B 109 and B 107, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5. Since the phase of the color subcarrier of the signals other than the signal S m,n differ from that of the latter signal by 180 , the vertical filter B 7 and the horizontal filter B 8 function to separate the luminance signal component and the chrominance signal component in the respective directions according to the following The filter outputs Y That is, when As to the operation of the present adaptive comb filter for the PAL color television signal, the PAL composite color television input signal sampled in synchronism with the color subcarrier with the sampling frequency f A luminance signal and a chrominance signal of a composite color television signal P m,2n 1 and an odd number line can be separated in the same manner using two signals at points remote vertically from the signal P m,2n 1 by two lines, and two signals at points remote horizontally from the signal by two samples. That is, since, in the PAL system, the subcarrier phase changes every four lines, it is possible to separate with the same circuit the luminance signal and the chrominance signal using samples vertically remote from the signal by two lines. As mentioned hereinfore, the adaptive comb filter of this embodiment is constructed such that signal components of the composite color television signal whose vertical or horizontal waveform variation is slower than the other are used to separate the luminance and chrominance signals. Therefore, it is possible to respond to sharp variations of the image to exactly separate the luminance and chrominance signal, resulting in exact reproduction of the received image signal without cross color and or dot disturbance. A further embodiment of the present invention will be explained by referring to Fig. 17. In this case, f The delay circuits C 14 and C 15 delay their input signals by two sampling periods, while the delay circuits C 13 and C 16 delay their input signals by periods corresponding to one line less two sampling periods. Therefore, the delay circuit connecting the delay circuits C 13 and C 14 is equivalent to the one line delay circuit C 11 shown in Fig. 8, while the delay circuit connecting the delay circuits C 15 and C 16 is equivalent to the one line delay circuit C 12 shown in Fig. 8. The vertical filtering circuit C 10 executes the operation of the equation for D The comparator C 4 determines which of the signals E The operations of the bandpass filter C 2 and subtractor C 3 in the subsequent stages of the signal lines C 102 and C 104 are the same as those explained for the case of Fig. 8. Fig. 18 is a block diagram of an embodiment of the present invention for the case of the PAL system composite color television signal, and the same reference numeral as those in Fig. 17 indicate the same or corresponding circuits. Further, reference numerals C 18 and C 19 denote delay circuits providing delays of periods corresponding to two lines less two sampling periods. Therefore, the circuit connecting in series the circuits C 18 and C 14 delays the signal by two line periods, and the circuit connecting in series the circuits C 15 and C 19 delays the signal by two line periods. With reference to Fig. 18, the operation circuit C 10 performs the calculations The calculations of these equations are carried out in the same manner. As in the case of Fig. 17, the operation circuit C 17 performs the calculations As in the case of Fig. 17, the comparator C 4 performs the calculations The comparator also outputs an output of the operation circuit C 10 or C 17 to the signal line C 104 in accordance with a result of comparison between D In order to use the circuit of Fig. 17 for the NTSC system and the circuit of Fig. 18 for the PAL system in common, it suffices for the delay circuits C 18 and C 19 shown in Fig. 18 to be designed as variable delay circuits and for the amount of delay to be set as Z As is believed evident from above explanation, the transfer function of the circuit shown in Fig. 17 can be represented by Therefore, the transfer function of the circuit shown in Fig. 18 can be represented by To simplify the relation between the data signals calculated by the operation circuits C 10 and C 17 shown in Fig. 17 and Fig. 18, if the signal S m,n is considered as the pertinent data signal S₀, S m,n 1 is taken as S As explained above, according to the present invention, to separate a luminance signal and a chrominance signal from a composite color television signal digitized at a sampling frequency which is 2k times the color subcarrier frequency, a transversal filter is used for the picture signal which suddenly changes vertically on the display screen and a vertical filter is used for the picture signal which suddenly changes horizontally through automatic selection by a selector. Accordingly, the present invention can provide a luminance and chrominance signals separation filter which is effective for any kind of picture signals. A further preferred embodiment of the present invention will be explained hereinafter with reference to Fig. 19, which is a block diagram of a subnyquist sampling system utilizing a subnyquist sampling filter in accordance with the present invention. More specifically, Fig. 19 shows a block diagram of an adaptive prefilter. Fig. 20 shows a block diagram of an adaptive interpolation filter employed in the subnyquist sampling system shown in Fig. 19. In each of these figure, D 31 is adaptive prefilter, D 34 is an adaptive interpolation filter, D 41 is an activity arithmetic operation circuit, D 48 is a comparator circuit, D 49 is a low pass filter bank, D 57 is a selector, and D 67 is an interpolation filter bank. An analog input picture signal D 1 is sampled by the nyquist sampling frequency f Next, operations of the adaptive prefilter shown in Fig. 20 will be explained. The input digital input picture signal D 3 is delayed by the line delay circuits D 12 and D 18 and the dot delay circuits D 14 and D 16 such that the signal S m,n 1 and following four picture signals are output simultaneously. Namely, S m 1,n , S m,n , S m 1,n and S m,n 1 corresponding to D 37, D 38, D 39 and D 40, respectively appear simultaneously. With these picture signals, the activity arithmetic operation circuit D 41 calculates the activity in the six directions around the dot point S m,n on the display screen as indicated below These activities correspond to signals D 42, D 43, D 44, D 45, D 46 and D 47, respectively, indicated in Fig. 20. The activities A₁ m,n i 1 to 6 in the above six directions are sent to the comparison and determination circuit D 48 and the direction where the minimum activity min A These filter outputs correspond to signals D 50, D 51, D 52, D 53, D 54 and D 55, respectively, indicated in the drawings. From the above six filtered output picture signals X D 56 in the direction where the activity is a minimum, thus becoming the adaptive prefilter output picture signal X m,n D 32 of the adaptive prefilter D 31. This adaptive prefilter output picture signal X m,n of the adaptive prefilter D 31 shows little deterioration of picture quality. Next, the adaptive prefilter output picture signal D 32 of the adaptive prefilter D 31 is subnyquist sampled through the subsampler D 6 to become the subsample output picture signal D 33. Namely, the signals ..., X m,n 1 , ..., X m 1,n , X m 1,n , ..., X m,n 1 , ... are obtained on a time sequential basis. The operations of adaptive interpolation filter shown in Fig. 21 will be explained. When the signal X m, n 1 appears as the subsample output picture signal D 33, the subsample line delay circuits D 22 and D 25 and the dot delay circuit D 14 output simultaneously the picture signals of X m 1,n , X m 1,n and X m,n 1 corresponding to D 58, D 59 and D 60, respectively . At this time, the activity operation circuit D 41 calculates the activities D These activities correspond to signals D 61, D 62, D 63, D 64, D 65 and D 66, respectively, indicated in Fig. 21. The direction where the activities B indicating the direction where the activity is a minimum is sent to the selector D 57. Simultaneously, since the picture signals extracted by the subsampler D 6 in the interpolation filter bank D 67 are recovered by interpolation from the optimum direction, the adaptive interpolation picture signals Y These filter outputs correspond to signals D 68, D 69, D 70, D 71, D 72 and D 73 indicated in Fig. 21. These adaptive interpolation picture signals Y As explained above, according to the subnyquist sampling system composed of the adaptive prefilter D 31, subsampler D 6, adaptive interpolation filter D 34, etc., of the present invention, pictures can be recovered with less loop noise and interpolation noise and deterioration in resolution even when the amount of data is reduced to a half. Regarding above embodiment, an in field subnyquist sampling system is described, but the present embodiment can also be adapted to a subnyquist sampling system having an allocation as shown in Fig. 9 in a plurality of frame periods by introducing a frame memory. Moreover, in case the sample picture element positions are inverted alternately between the fields and frames in time, it is possible to use the interpolation filter to introduce the activity in the time direction. In above embodiment, the filter is changed in such a direction as the minimum activity, but it is also possible to change the filter at the medium activity center value .
