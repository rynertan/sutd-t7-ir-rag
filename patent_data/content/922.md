# A process for preparing a non woven fibrous web from fibers and a latex, and the non woven fibrous material so prepared.

## Abstract
A high strength, non woven fibrous material is prepared by a mixing an aqueous slurry of a negatively charged, water insoluble natural or synthetic fiber or blend of fibers with an amount up to the fiber charge reversal point of a structured particle latex having pH independent cationic charges bound at or near the particle surface to form an aqueous suspension, b draining water from the aqueous suspension to form a wet web c wet pressing the web and d drying the web by heating.
