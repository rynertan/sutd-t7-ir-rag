# Voltage level detection circuit.

## Abstract
A voltage level detection circuit connected between first V In addition, the voltage level detection circuit may further comprise a third depletion type MIS transistor QD₁₃ having a drain connected to the drain of the first depletion type MIS transistor, a source connected to the source of the first de pletion type MIS transistor, and a gate connected to the output terminal of the output signal generation circuit, to output a stabilized output signal at the output terminal of the output signal generation circuit.
