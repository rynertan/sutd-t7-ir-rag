## Description
ANTIVIRAL AGENTS, THEIR PREPARATION AND USE This invention relates to certain deoxyuridine compounds which have antiviral activity. British Patent specification No. 1,601,020 discloses 2X deoxy 5 2 halogenovinyl uridines, which are said to possess antiviral activity. It has now been discovered that a class of novel 2 ,5 anhydro nucleosides have antiviral activity. According to the present invention, there is provided a compound of formula I EMI1.1 in which X represents a halogen atom, and Rl represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkanoyl group. Preferably, X represents a bromine atom and R1 is acetyl. When used herein, the term lower means that the group contains from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The compounds of the invention are particularly useful in the treatment of infections caused by herpes viruses, such as herpes simplexi type 1, herpes simplex type 2 and varicella. The compounds of formula I are also useful as intermediates in the synthesis of other biologically active 2 deoxynucleosides. The compounds of formula I may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula II EMI2.1 Wherein R1 and X are as defined in formula I and R2 is a leaving group, with a strong hindered base, such as 1,5 diazabicyclo 4,3,0 non 5 ene CDBN , or 1,5 diazabicyclo 5,4,05 undec 7 ene DBU . preferably in an organic, preferably a polar, solvent. The preferred solvent is acetonitrile, and the reaction is suitably carried out under reflux.Preferably, RZ is a tosyloxy, mesyloxy, p bromotosyloxy group or a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom. The product may be purified chromatographically, suitably by thin layer chromatography. The compounds of formula II may themselves be made by reacting a deoxyuridine derivative of formula III EMI3.1 wherein R l represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkanoyl group with a compound or mixture of compounds, which can replace the 5 hydroxyl group with the leaving group R2. Suitable compounds or mixtures for this replacement reaction will be known to those skilled in the art, but the following may be mentioned as preferred. Sulphonyl halides particularly the chloride , sulphonic acid anhydrides, and mixtures of triphenylphosphine and bromine or iodine. A particularly preferred compound is p toluene sulphonyl chloride. The reaction may take place in an organic, preferably a polar, solvent. A suitable solvent is pyridine, and the reaction is conveniently carried out at room temperature. The compound of formula Il may be purified chromatographically, suitable by column chromatography on silica gel. The preparation of the compounds of formula III where R1 is a lower alkanoyl group is described in our co pending UK Patent applications, Nos. 8108755 and 8113618. The compound of formula I may be utilised in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, in a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of the formula I together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Compositions which may be given by the oral route may be compounded in the form of syrups, tablets and capsules.When the composition is in the form of a tablet, any pharmaceutical carrier suitable for formulating such solid compositions may be used, for example magnesium stearate, starch, lactose, glucose, rice, flour and chalk. The composition may also be in the form of an ingestible capsule, for example of gelatin, to contain the compound, or in the form of a syrup, a solution or a suspension.Suitable liquid pharmaceutical carriers include ethyl alcohol, glycerine, saline and water to which flavouring or colouring agents may be added to form syrups. The compounds may also be presented with a sterils liquid carrier for injection. The composition may also be formulated for topical application to the skin or eyes. For topical application to the skin, the compounds of the invention may be made up into a cream, lotion or ointment. These formulations may be conventional formulations well known in the art, for example, as described in standard books of pharmaceutics and cosmetics, such as Harryls Cosmeticology published by Leonard HillBooks, and the British Pbarmacopaeia. The composition for application to the eyes may be a conventional eye drop composition well known in the art. Preferably the compositions of this invention are in unit dosage form or in some other form such that the patient may administer to himself a single dose. A suitable dosage unit might contain from 50 mg to 1 g of active ingredient, for example 100 to 500 mg. Such doses may be administered 1 to 4 times a day or more usually 2 or 3 times a day.The effective dose of compound depends on the particular compound employed, but is in general in the range of from 1.0 mg kg day to 20 mg kg of body weight per day or more usually 2.0 mgjkg day to 10 mg kg day. In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of treating viral infections in a human or non human animal, which comprises administering to the animal an effective, non toxic amount of a compound of formula I .
