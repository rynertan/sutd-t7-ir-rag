# Stable silicone coated release liner for pressure sensitive adhesive sheets.

## Abstract
Silicone coated release liner which, even after exposure to light in the presence of moisture, heat or both, displays release properties of less than 20 g cm width with respect to pressure sensitive adhesive tape. The coating contains noble metal, and the silicone polymer has substantially no residual ethylenic unsaturation. The silicone polymer is prepared by pre reacting polydimethyl siloxane with a noble metal catalyst before adding polymethylhydrosiloxane crosslinker.
