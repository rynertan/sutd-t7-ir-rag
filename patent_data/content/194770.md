## Description
The invention relates to liquid compositions that can form adherent, transparent, abrasion resistant polymeric films having prolonged antimicrobial properties. Recent studies have indicated that the contamination of both wet and dry household surfaces with potentially pathogenic quantities of bacteria is widespread. Following a study of bacterial flora in 200 homes, Scott et al., in Compositions intended for the controlled release of a disinfectant from a film of a stabilized hydrophilic polymer are disclosed in U.S Pat. No. 3,966,902. The polymer complex is stabilized as a metal complex by the addition of an inorganic aluminum, zirconium or zinc salt such as aluminum chlorohydrol to the polymerization mixture. The stabilization adjuvant is necessary due to the fact that upon contact with water, films of simple hydrogels become highly swollen and rapidly elute their additives. Furthermore, dry films both simple and metal complexed hydrogels do not adhere well to ceramic and other hard surfaces and lose their adhesion completely when wetted. Thus, a need exists for a disinfectant composition capable of forming a polymeric film on hard surfaces such as those formed of ceramics, glass, formica, plastics, metals and the like, which film can entrain a germicidal substance such as a quaternary ammonium salt or a phenolic. A need also exists for a composition capable of yielding a transparent film having strong adhesion to the substrate surface and high resistance against abrasive removal during commonly employed cleansing procedures. A further need exists for a disinfectant film capable of providing extended protection against microbial contamination. The present invention provides liquid disinfectant compositions which yield adherent, water resistant, polymeric films when coated onto porous or non porous hard surfaces and dried. The liquid compositions comprise germicidal agents which are effective to destroy pre existing microbial colonies and which impart prolonged antimicrobial properties to the deposited films. The liquid disinfectant compositions will comprise a film forming copolymer of a a monomer having a hydrophilic group and b an alpha, beta unsaturated carboxylic acid ester selected from the group consisting of aromatic esters , cycloalkyl esters and mixtures thereof. The copolymer will comprise about 20 99.5 mol of the hydrophilic monomer, and about 0.5 80 mol of the cycloalkyl or aromatic ester monomer, which can optionally be replaced with about 1 90 of an alkyl or alkoxy alkyl ester of an alpha, beta unsaturated acid. The copolymers are substantially free of inorganic metal salt complexation agents such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,966,902. These copolymers can be viewed as modified hydrogels which are surprisingly capable of forming films which are adherent to hard surfaces and are resistant to removal when exposed to water and mild abrasion. The films can be readily deposited from dilute solutions or dispersions of the copolymer in volatile solvent systems. These liquid systems will also incorporate germicidal agents such as phenols or a quaternary ammonium salt. The agents are entrapped in the dried polymeric films, and can be incrementally released when the coated surface is contacted with moisture. Contact with atmospheric humidity can assist in maintaining treated surfaces in a substantially microbe free condition, while exposure to larger amounts of water, as when the surface is moistened by wiping, food residues, dishwater and the like, can lead to the release of increased amounts of the germicide. The polymeric films remain clear and non tacky, and thus do not detract from the appearance of the surfaces to which they are applied. Although not wishing to be bound by any theory of action, it is believed that the desirable properties of the present composition is due to the balance of hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of the copolymer. The hydrophilicity of the resultant films may assist both the retention of the germicide and its exposure and activation by externally applied water. The hydrophobicity imparted to the films by the aromatic and or the cycloalkyl ester comonomer apparently imparts the necessary adherence and abrasion resistance to the dried films. As used herein with respect to antimicrobial action or to the release of a germicide from the present films, the term prolonged is intended to refer to the retention of substantial antimicrobial action as determined by laboratory test methods after at least 2 and most preferably after at least 5 10 water washes. As used herein with respect to the solvents used as carriers for the active ingredients of the present compositions, the term volatile is intended to define solvents or solvent systems which readily evaporate when applied to hard surfaces in thin films at ambient conditions e.g. at about 15 35 C. As used herein with respect to the surfaces treated by the present compositions, the term hard is intended to refer to surfaces composed of refractory materials such as glazed and unglazed tile, brick, porcelain, ceramics, metals, glass and the like, and also includes hard plastics such as formica, polystyrenes, vinyls, acrylics, polyesters, and the like. Percentages of materials are weight percentages wt unless otherwise indicated. The liquid disinfectant composition of the present invention comprises a solution of a minor amount of a film forming copolymer comprising 20 99,5 mol of a a monomer having a hydrophilic functional group, and b about 0.5 80 mol of said copolymer of an alpha, beta unsaturated carboxylic acid ester selected from the group consisting of aromatic esters , cycloalkyl esters, and mixtures thereof. The copolymer is dissolved in a major amount of a volatile solvent which also incorporates an amount of a germicidal agent effective to impart prolonged antimicrobial properties to the films formed upon removal of the solvent from coatings of said compositions. Copolymer monomer b preferably comprises a combination of a cycloalkyl ester or an aromatic ester of an alpha, beta unsaturated acid in combination with about 1 90 mol of the cycloalkyl or aromatic ester of an alkyl ester or an alkoxy alkyl ester of an alpha, beta unsaturated acid. Hydrophilic monomer materials which may be utilized in accord with the present invention are preferably esters of alpha, beta unsaturated carboxylic acids such as methacrylic acid, acrylic acid, itaconic acid, aconitic acid, cinnamic acid, crotonic acid, mesaconic acid, carboxyethyl acrylic acid, maleic acid, or fumaric acid.

The film forming copolymers of the present invention incorporate about 20 99.5 mol of the hydrophilic monomer component, preferably about 50 95 mol . In accord with the present invention, the copolymerization of the hydrophilic monomer with at least one alpha, beta unsaturated carboxylic acid ester selected from the group consisting of cycloalkyl esters, aromatic esters, and mixtures thereof, substantially improves the adhesion of the copolymer films to hard surfaces. Preferably, the copolymer will include about 0.5 80 mol of at least one of these modifying comonomers, most preferably about 1 50 mol . As used herein, the term cycloalkyl ester includes bi and tricycloalkyl esters, and the term aromatic ester includes hetero aromatic esters and tetrahydrofurfur. Especially preferred cycloalkyl and aromatic esters are those of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or itaconic acid. Useful aromatic esters of these acids include phenyl, benzyl, and phenoxyethyl esters. Useful cycloalkyl esters include C₅ C₁₂ cycloalkyls, e.g. the cyclohexyl, isobornyl and adamantyl esters of these acids. Alkyl and alkoxy alkyl esters of alpha, beta unsaturated carboxylic acids can be used in combination with the aromatic and or cycloalkyl ester. Preferably the alkyl esters will be selected from higher alkyl esters, such as those of about 5 22 carbon atoms, most preferably about 5 12 carbon atoms. The alkyl and alkoxy alkyl esters can be employed to the extent of about 1 90 mol by weight of the total of the modifying comonomer. Preferably the mol ratio of cycloalkyl or aromatic ester to alkyl ester is about 2 1 1 2. The alkyl and alkoxy alkyl esters of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and itaconic acid are preferred for use in the present comonomer mixtures. Examples of these fatty alkyl ester comonomers which can be employed in combination with cycloalkyl and or aromatic ester monomers include myristyl, palmityl and stearyl acrylates, methacrylates and itaconates. Examples of useful C₅ C₁₂ compounds include hexyl, octyl, ethyl hexyl , isodecyl and lauryl, acrylates, methacrylates and itaconates. Alkyl esters having branched, as opposed to straight chain moieties are also preferred for use in the present copolymers. Alkoxy alkyl esters useful as comonomers include C₁ C₄ alkoxy C₁ C₄ alkyl esters of acrylic, methacrylic or itaconic acid such as methoxy ethyl, ethoxy ethyl, methoxy propyl or ethoxy propyl. The film forming copolymers can be prepared by carrying out the polymerization of the monomers in a solvent or solvent mixture and at concentrations wherein the resultant copolymers remain in solution. Preferred solvents include lower alkanols such as ethanol ketones, glycol esters or ethers, lower alkyl acetates tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide. The monomeric starting materials are typically dissolved in the solvent to the desired concentration, e.g. to a total concentration about 15 30 by weight, although higher or lower concentrations may be employed in some cases. The polymerization reactions are initiated in the conventional manner and preferably by use of radical forming initiators. Instances of suitable initiators include dibenzoyl peroxide, tert butyl peroctoate, cumene hydroperoxide, diazodiisobutyrodinitrile, diisopropylpercarbonate or ammonium persulfate, per se or in combination with a reducing agent, i.e., in the form of an oxidation reduction system. During the course of the reaction, the reaction mixture may be agitated and heated, preferably in a closed system under an inert atmosphere, to about 50 100 C, preferably to about 75 95 C. After completion of the polymerization reaction, a solution of copolymer results, which can be employed without further purification or concentration in the present disinfectant compositions. The liquid compositions will incorporate an amount of one or more germicidal agents effective to both disinfect surfaces upon contact and to impart prolonged antimicrobial action to the polymeric films prepared therefrom. A wide variety of antimicrobial agents may be included in effective amounts without inducing undesirable interactions or chemical reactions between the major components of the compositions. Such agents can include chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine gluconate, glutaral, halazone, hexachlorophene, nitrofurazone, nitromersol, povidone iodine, thimerosol, C₁ C₅ parabens, hypochlorite salts, clofucarban, clorophene, poloxamer iodine, phenolics, mafenide acetate, aminacrine hydrochloride, quaternary ammonium salts, oxychlorosene, metabromsalan, merbromin, dibromsalan, glyceryl laurate, sodium and or zinc pyrithione, dodecyl diethylenediamine glycine and or dodecyl aminopropyl glycine. Phenolic compounds are among the preferred germicides for use in the present compositions. Useful phenolic germicides include phenol, m cresol, o cresol, p cresol, o phenyl phenol, 4 chloro m cresol, chloroxylenol, 6 n amyl m cresol, resorcinol, resorcinol monoacetate, p tert butyl phenol and o benzyl p chlorophenol. The biologically active, water soluble salts of these compounds may also be employed, e.g., the alkali metal salts. Of these compounds o benzyl p chlorophenol is preferred due to its high germidical power. Quaternary ammonium salts are also preferred germicides for use in the present invention and include the N higher C₁₄ C₂₄ alkyl N benzyl quaternary ammonium salts which comprise water solubilizing anions such as halide, e.g., chloride, bromide and iodide sulfate, methosulfate and the like and the heterocyclic imides such as the imidazolinium salts. For convenience, the aliphatiac quaternary ammonium salts may be structurally defined as follows Other useful aliphatic quaternary ammonium compounds include the N,N di higher C₁₀ C₂₄ alkyl N,N di lower C₁ C₄ alkyl quaternary ammonium salts such as distearyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, cetyl dimethyl ethyl ammonium bromide, dicoco dimethyl ammonium chloride, dihydrogenated tallow dimethyl ammonium chloride, di tallow dimethyl ammonium chloride, distearyl dimethyl ammonium methosulfate cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide and di hydrogenated tallow dimethyl ammonium methosulfate. Other useful nitrogenous germicides include benzethonium chloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, methylbenzethonium chloride, domiphen bromide or gentian violet. The total concentration of the germicidal component of the present liquid compositions can vary widely, depending upon its antimicrobial activity, solubility or stability. Although high weight ratios of germicide to copolymer, e.g. 2 3 1, can afford satisfactory disinfectant films, generally the concentration of the germicide will not exceed the concentration of the dissolved copolymer. For example, the present disinfectant compositions will preferably comprise about 0.01 10 , most preferably about 0.05 5 by weight of the phenolic or quaternary ammonium salts. Highly durable, abrasion resistant films can be achieved when the total concentration of the germicidal agent in the present compositions comprises about 0.01 50 , preferably about 0.25 20 , and most preferably about 0.5 5 by weight of the dissolved copolymer. The present film forming liquid compositions are readily prepared by dissolving the germicidal agent in a solution of the copolymer with agitation under ambient conditions, followed by dilution of the resultant solution to the appropriate concentration by addition of the volatile carrier solvent or solvent system. Since the copolymer is commonly prepared in a volatile solvent such as a lower alkanol or a lower alkyl acetate, this solution can be diluted with a compatible organic solvent. As the organic solvent there can be employed alcohols, particularly lower aliphatic saturated alcohols, e.g. ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, propyl alcohol, glycols, e.g. ethylene glycol diethylene glycol, propylene glycol and dipropylene glycol, ethylene glycol methyl ether, ethylene glycol ethyl ether, n propylene glycol monomethyl ether, n propylene glycol monoethyl ether, isopropylene glycol monomethyl ether, isopropylene glycol monoethyl ether, m pyrol and ethyl acetate. Mixtures of these solvents with amounts of water can also be used, provided that the homogeneous solutions of the copolymer and the germicide are maintained. For example solutions formed by dissolving the germicide in ethanolic solutions of the comonomer can be diluted with a compatible volatile solvent or solvent system such as isopropanol isopropyl alcohol or isopropanol water. Useful compositions of this type can comprise at least about 85 of a mixture of isopropanol and water. Therefore, the preferred liquid disinfectant compositions of the present invention will comprise about 0.25 10 , preferably about 0.5 5 of the film forming copolymer about 0.10 10 , preferably about 0.05 5 of the germicidal agent, most preferably selected from a phenolic or quaternary ammonium salt the remainder of the composition being the volatile solvent or solvent system. Preferably the film forming copolymer will incorporate about 50 95 mol of the hydrophilic monomer, most preferably 2 hydroxyethylmethacrylate or 2 hydroxyethylacrylate and about 10 35 mol of a C₅ C₈ cycloalkyl acrylate or methacrylate, an aromatic acrylate or methacrylate or mixtures thereof. Optionally, a higher alkyl acrylate or methacrylate monomer will also be included in the copolymer, replacing the cycloalkyl and or aromatic monomer to the extent of about 25 75 mol . Minor amounts of adjuvants such as an indicator of germicide level, fragrance, surfactants or dyes may also be included in the present compositions, insofar as they are compatible with the film forming process. For example, about 0.5 5 of a compatible surfactant can be included in the present compositions to enhance their cleaning power. The finished disinfectant compositions are homogeneous liquids which are applied to the surfaces to be treated by dipping, spraying, brushing, roller coating, pad coating or using similar coating procedures. For household applications, hand operated pump type or pressurized aerosol sprayers are effective. Although the present compositions are particularly adapted to adhere to hard surfaces, they can also be employed to coat or otherwise treat materials such as sponges, flexible plastics, textiles, wood and the like. Generally, the coating process is continued to the extent required to deliver an amount of the liquid composition which rapidly dries to a clear, uniform polymeric film under ambient conditions, e.g., about 25 100 mg in² of liquid composition is generally effective to disinfect and impart prolonged antimicrobial protection to tile surfaces. The germicidal films are glossy, resistant to mild abrasion and are not broken or substantially depleted of biocide by repeated wettings. Repeated application of the liquid compositions does not result in film build up since the solvents present can act to resolubilize and level the prior applied film. The invention will be further described by reference to the following detailed examples. Cyclohexylmethacrylate, 5 mol 2.46 g , isodecyl methacrylate, 5 mol 3.31g and 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate 90 mol 34.23g were dissolved in 160 ml of 95 ethyl alcohol and 0.4 g of dibenzoyl peroxide were added. The solution was bubbled with nitrogen for 10 minutes and heated in a closed system pressure bottle for 8 hours at 80 C. The resulting solution of the copolymer was used for the preparation of disinfectant compositions. A copolymer solution was prepared by the procedure of Example 1, with the exception that 3.0 mol cyclohexyl methacrylate, 7 mol isodecyl methacrylate and 90 mol 2 hydroxyethylmethacrylate were copolymerized. A copolymer solution was prepared by the procedure of Example 1, except that 7.0 mol cyclohexyl methacrylate, 3 mol isodecyl methacrylate and 90 mol 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate were employed. Films of copolymers were cast from solutions prepared according to Examples 1 3 on glazed ceramic bathroom tiles and formica. After drying at ambient temperatures and humidities, the quality of the glossy films was tested. The appearance of the film and the abrasion caused by the application of a wet paper towel after the coated substrate had been immersed for 45 minutes in water were visually evaluated. The results summarized on Table I indicate that polymeric films cast from alcohol water 95 5 solutions of the copolymers of Examples 1 3 exhibit satisfactory physical properties when applied to hard surfaces and subsequently exposed to moisture. According to the procedure in Example 1, copolymers containing the following hydrophobic cyclic and aliphatic methacrylates can be prepared Copolymer solutions prepared according to the procedure Example 1 which contained only 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate and a single cycloalkyl, alkyl or aromatic methacrylate were prepared and their films on tiles and formica were evaluated by the procedures of Example 4. The copolymers containing only a cycloalkyl or aromatic ester comonomer performed well on tiles but only weakly adhered to formica. Copolymers comprising C₁₁ C₁₈ alkyl comonomers exhibited satisfactory adhesion to formica but performed poorly on tiles. Copolymers comprising only a C₆ or C₁₀ ester as the comonomer performed poorly in this evaluation. Solutions containing only polymerized hydrophilic monomers were prepared according to the procedure in Example 1, to evaluate the effect of eliminating other comonomers. Films were cast and their adhesion and abrasion resistance to glazed tiles and formica were evaluated after a 45 min. immersion in water. As indicated by the data summarized in Table III, typical hydrophilic polymers like DAA and HM exhibited high swelling, to yield often hazy films which peeled off the substrates. Two film forming liquid disinfectant solutions were prepared by combining the copolymer solution of Example 1 with either a quaternary ammonium salt germicide quat a mixture of myristyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride and dodecyl dimethyl p ethyl benzyl ammonium chloride, BTC 2125 M 80 active, Onyx Chemical Co., Jersey City, N.J., or a phenol 2 benzyl 4 chlorophenol germicide, and isopropanol, as indicated on Table IV. Films of the disinfectant composition were cast onto glazed and unglazed ceramic tiles to the extent indicated by spraying the tiles with the liquid compositions and allowing the wet coatings to air dry. Clear, abrasion resistant polymeric films resulted. One ml of a bacterial inoculum The results summarized on Table V demonstrate that films prepared from the formulations of Table IV are effective in reducing a subsequently introduced bacterial population. Recovery of bacteria from the control tiles was continuous from day one to day five. Recovery from the treated tiles was not observed or was consistently lower, indicating a static activity situation. The disinfectant films were somewhat less effective on porous than on glazed tiles. The film forming compositions summarized on Table VI were prepared and employed to cast disinfectant films on glazed tiles 16 in² as described in Example VII A . Treated and untreated control tiles were inoculated with either The observations summarized in Table VII indicate that disinfectant films prepared from the formulations of Table VI remain adherent, resistant to microbial contamination, and exhibit prolonged germicidal action after at least five inoculations and 14 water washes. The liquid disinfectant compositions were prepared by combining the individual components as summarized in Table VIII. Formulations I and II were evaluated as spray disinfectants on glass slides inoculated with The invention has been described with reference to various specific and preferred embodiments and techniques. However, it should be understood that many variations and modifications may be made while remaining within the spirit and scope of the invention.
