## Description
Title Method and apparatus for transferring proofed doughpieces on an oven underlay. The invention relates to a method of transferring proofed doughpieces from a proofer transport to a continuously moving oven underlay, during which each time a doughpiece batch of the proofer transport is taken over by a transfer belt which is supervised by a sensor arranged adjacent the oventriderlay, is moved towards said.wn underlay while the batch lying on the transfer belt is deposited on the underlay b driving the transfer belt in supplying sense while simultaneouslywthdrawing the same over the underlay surface. Such a method is disclosed in US patent 3,603,271, wherein the transfer of doughpieces is effected by an endless transfer belt with roller drive mounted in a slide movable between the proofer transport and the oven and through two self supporting end edges where the belt is guided about relatively flat frames, so that said end edges can be brought in close proximity to the supporting transport faces of the doughpieces, whereby said doughpieces are drawn over the one edge on the belt and deposited over the other edge on the carrier in an oven. During the transfer of doughpieces from a proofer tranport to a continuously moving oven underlay, the supply speed of the doughpieces is determined by the speed of the proofer transport, while the delivery speed of the doughpiedes is determined by the speed of the oven underlay. This means that differences in speed between supply and delivery have to be equalized by means of the endless transfer belt. In particular in case of srra l bread which has a short baking time, so that the speed of the over underlay is high, substantial spaces occur on the oven underlay, i.e. the filling of the oven is not optimal. It is the object of the invention to eliminate this drawback. To this effect according to the invention, signalled by the batch already present on the oven underlay, the transfer belt is moved from a position behind the proofer transport, over the proofer transport towards the ovt under lay, taking up abatch kept in ready position on the proofer transport and depositing said batch consecutively to the previous batch on the over underlay with simultaneous movement of the transfer belt opposite to the transport direction of the ovenrnderlay, which movement of the transfer belt is continued until the starting position behind the proofer transport is again reached. Since the depositing of doughpieces is thus effected immediately consecutively to the preceding doughpieces batch and by the specific manner of depositing of the doughpieces with a retracting transfer belt, different oven underlay speeds can be simply taken into account, which are determined by the baking times required for the different baking products. Independently of the underlay speed there is thus ensured an optimal occupation of the oven. For performing the method, the invention provides an apparatus having a reliable operation through a simple manner of driving. The apparatus according to the invention for transferring doughpieces from a proofer transport to an ovnunder lay is fitted with a single transfer belt drivable in two directions and furthermore being entirely movable between the pickup zone adjacent the proofer transport to the supply zone above the underlay US A 3,603,271 , which apparatus is characterized in that use is made of a sensor, such as a photocell, for viewing the position of a preceding batch and initiating the movement of the loaded transfer belt to a supply position above the underlay, as well as a sensor adjacent the pickup zone for doughpieces supplied by the proofer transport for positicina the doughpieces in such a way that, seen in the direction of the oven transport, the leading doughpiece is always in the same place at the moment when the doughpieces are loaded on the transfer belt. It is thus ensured that during the take over of the doughpieces, these always come to lie on a previously selected place on the transfer belt and during the depositing of the doughpieces on the oven underlay, these properly link up with the preceding batch. A simple control of the transfer belt is the one whereby according to the invention the drive of the transfer belt is effected by means of a rack which is stationarybeforeloading the transfer belt with dough pieces from the proofer transport, while the transfer belt is drawn along the rack, after loading the transfer belt the rack and the transfer belt are jointly moved to the supply position above the oven underlay, where the rack again is arrested, while the transfer belt is displaced relative to the rack for driving the belt in supplying sense, after which the assembly of rack and transfer belt is again moved to the starting position. The transfer belt according to the invention, as already stated, can be driven in loading and unloading sense. This means that only a part of the length of the endless belt has a doughpiece carrying function. Using this, in a further embodiment of the invention, a drawback of relatively short and broad endless conveyor belts, viz.difficult centring thereof, is eliminated by replacing according to the invention the non carrying portion of the conveyor belt by a plurality of chains guided over chain wheels. The chain wheels are mounted on a common shaft, likewise carrying the gear which coacts with the rack. One embodiment of the transfer apparatus for doughpieces according to the invention will now be explained, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic view of successive phases a f of a transfer cycle Fig. 2 is a more detailed, however diagrammatic representation of the transfer belt Fig. 3 is a side tew of the transfer apparatus Fig. 4 is a top view of the transfer apparatus and Fig. 5 is a left hand end view of the transfer apparatus according to Fig. 3. According to the drawing, in particular Fig. 1 and 3, proofed doughpieces 1 are supplied on pallets 2from aproofer not shown . The proofer transport is indicated by 3.Empty pallets are discharged on a conveyor 4. The doughpieces 1 are to be transferred to an oven conveyor belt oven underlay 5 which moves according to arrow T. The transfer is effected by means of a transfer belt 6 of the nibbling belt type, i.e. provided with a flat self supporting edge or nose 7 which can be brought exactly above the bearing area of a pallet 2 so that through relative movement of the nose 7 and the pallet 2 and simultaneous drive of the belt in pickup sense, doughpieces 1 can be drawn on the belt 6. In the embodiment of the transfer belt 6 as depicted in Fig. 2, the belt is composed of a carrying portion formed by an underlay 8 and a non carrying portion in which extend chains 10 applied over chain wheels 9. The chain wheels 9 are fixed on a shaft 11 on which is also secured a pinion 12 which is inegement with a rack 13. The rack 13 is movable over a rod 14. By displacement of the pinion over the rack 13, the chain wheels 9 are rotated and thus belt 8, 10 is driven, while the underlay 8 is drawn about a flat frame 15 see Fig. 2 for drawing nibbling doughpieces 1 on the underlay 8 or vice versa for unloading doughpieces. The operation of the transfer apparatus will now be explained by means of Fig. 1. InDhase a transfer belt 6 and rack 13 are in the starting position, on the proofer transport 3 there is provided a pallet 2 with doughpieces 1 and on the oven underlay can be seen a preceding batch L which has not yet passed a photocell 16. In phase b the batch L has just passed the photocell so that the loading of the transfer belt 6 is initiated.The transfer belt 6 moves relative to the rack 13 so that the belt is driven in doughpieces pickup sense and simultaneously the nose 7 moves over the pallet 2. The rack 13 is stationary. Phase c shows the situation in which the doughpieces 1 have been taken over from the pallet 2 on the belt 6.In this phase the rack 13 is still stationary in the starting position of phase a. In phase d belt 6 and rack 13 in the relative position of phase c have been jointly moved to a position above the belt 5 wherein the nose 7 is present just behind the preceding batch L. The empty pallet 2 has been pushed on the discharge conveyor 4. The doughpieces 1 in phase e are deposited on the oven underlay 5 successively behind the preceding batch L by rearwardly displacing the belt 6 along the stationary rack 13 until phase f is attained, from which belt 6 and rack 13 are both moved rearwardly to the starting position of phase a, after which a new cycle can be initiated with the supply of a loaded pallet 2. Details of a practical embodiment are shown inFigs. 3 5. The transfer belt 6 is mounted between side plates 17 slideable over rods 18 by means of drive chains 19. The rack 13 is slidable over the rods 14 by means of a pawl drive an element 20 of which is shown. As also indicated in Fig. 2, an auxiliary roller 21 can contribute to a reliable guide of small doughpieces on and off the belt 6. The auxiliary roller 21 is mounted parallel to the nose 7 in arms 22 the position of which can be influenced by suspension from rods 23, rollers 24 and can tracks 25 a portion 26 of which can be swivelled away upwardly. Through a lever 24 the relative position of the auxiliary roller 21 relative to the cam tracks 25 can be determined. Also the transfer belt 6 with the nose 7 can be steered in different height positions, on the one hand for bridging differences in height between pickup and delivery level of doughpieces and on the other hand to have the possibility of dropping at such a high level that the doughpieces are deposited upside down. The differences in height of the nose 7 are indicated in Fig. 3 at the right hand side in the Figure. For steering the belt 6 in height direction, use is made of rods 27 and rollers 28 riding on the cam tracks 25, 26. Furthermore Fig. 3 shows besides the photocell 16 at the delivery position for doughpieces 1 on the over underlay 5, a3so photocells 29 and 30 for controlling the position of the pallets 2 in such a way that a doughpieces batch resting thereon is accurately positioned prior to the pickup by the transfer belt 6 so that also the position of the batch on the transfer belt 6 and the depositing position on the underlay 5 is fixed and furthermore also the discharge of the empty pallets is automatically controlled.
