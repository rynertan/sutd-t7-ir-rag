# Distillative separation employing bottom additives.

## Abstract
An improved method for the distillation of a feed stream 12 containing hydrocarbon components, which method is directed toward the production of a bottom product stream 26 and an overhead product stream 16 , both with desired specifications, which method comprises recycling a minor portion of the bottom product stream typically, but not necessarily, derived from said separation directly to a reflux condenser for the overhead product stream of said method, in order to effect a savings in energy in said distillative method, such as by adjusting the column operating condi tions, such as the column operating pressure or the top or bottom operating temperatures of said column.
