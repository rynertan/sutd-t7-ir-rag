# Selective N protection of aminoglycosides and novel, selectively protected aminoglycoside intermediates.

## Abstract
This invention relates to the selective N protection of aminoglycosides and to novel, selectively protected aminoglycoside intermediates. Modifications in aminoglycoside molecules are usually accomplished by multi stage reactions whereby in most cases amino groups need to be protected in order to avoid side reactions. To obtain 1 N alkyl and 1 N acyl substituted 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitols which are very potent antibiotics, ideally all other amino groups are protected before introduction of the 1 N substituent into the 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitol. A process is provided for the selective protection of the 3 amino function in a 1,3 di N unprotected poly N protected 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitol, wherein the 6 O aminoglycosyl has an amino function at the 3 position and hydroxyl functions at the 2 and 4 positions. Also, the respective 1 N unprotected poly N protected 4,6 di O aminoglycosyl 1,3 diaminocyclitol intermediates are described. Selective protection of the 3 amino function is accomplished by reaction with no more than one molar equivalent of available 1 Z imidazole wherein Z is an amino protecting group.
