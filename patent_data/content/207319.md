# ADHESIVE FOR SILICONE RUBBERS

## Abstract
The silicone rubber adhesive of the present invention is composed of a particular organopolysiloxane, condensation reaction catalyst and organoperoxide in restricted blending ratios. As a result, a characteristic of the present invention is that various organic materials may be tightly and durably bonded to silicone rubbers by applying the adhesive of the present invention to the surface of a cured silcone rubber and laying on and then curing an organic material such as a synth etic rubber composition, for example, ethylene propylene ter polymer rubber or chloroprene rubber, or a phenol resin, epoxy resin, etc. In addition, it is also a characteristic of the present invention that silicone rubber may be tightly bonded to various materials by applying the silicone rubber adhesive of the present invention to various organic materials as men tioned above, bringing a silicone rubber composition which contains a curing catalyst into contact and then curing.
