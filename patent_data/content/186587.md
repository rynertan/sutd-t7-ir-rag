# High speed parity check circuit.

## Abstract
A high speed parity circuit uses a sequence of simplified exclusive OR circuits responsive to data input terminals containing a data signal and its complement and terminating in a sense amplifier, together with an operating sequence in which the inputs to the sequence are grounded while the data lines are first brought high and then set to the correct data state to form a pair of separate paths through the sequence when no current flows, after which set up opera tion an input voltage circuit raises the voltage on one of the paths smoothly, so that the sense amplifier can respond as soon as its input is large enough, without waiting for a settling time.
