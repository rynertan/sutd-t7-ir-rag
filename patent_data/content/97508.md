## Description
IMPROVED PHOSPHORIC ACID FUEL CELL ELECTRODE The present invention relates to a class of electrodes, preferably cathodes, for phosphoric acid based fuel cells, and to a method for increasing the efficient operating life of such electrodes by depositing on a corrosion resistant carbon support a mixture of a platinum group metal and an oxide of one or more of germanium, chromium, tungsten, niobium, zirconium, hafnium, tantalum, and gallium. Generally speaking, a fuel cell is an electrochemical device for obtaining direct conversion of fuel, such as hydrogen and oxidant such as oxygen or air to a low voltage DC current. Typically, such cells comprise a fuel electrode anode , an oxidant electrode cathode an electrolyte positioned between the electrodes, and means for separately introducing fuel and oxidant to the respective electrode. In operation, fuel such as hydrogen or suitable hydrocarbon is oxidized at the anode in the presence of an electrocatalyst with an electrolyte to form the corresponding hydronium ion. Oxygen or oxygen containing gas such as air is fed to the cathode, where it is reduced at the electrocatalytic surface in the presence of an electrolyte with corresponding consumption of electrons transferred from the anode via an external circuit. The resulting potential between anode and cathode can be usefully applied to perform tasks compatible with direct current or converted to alternating current. Generally speaking oxygen . reduction promoting catalysts are Group VIII metals of platinum, palladium, ruthenium, iridium, osmium, or combinations thereof, and alloys thereof with various non precious metals, such asClass 1 b and others. In the operating state, these metals may contain oxides or other derivatives thereof.Catalysts of this type are disclosed, for instance, in U.S.P. 3,962,139. For purposes of convenience, efficiency and durability, such catalyst material is often prepared by dispersing colloids onto a carrier, or by dissolving precursor salts in solution which may then be applied to a carrier or directly onto a support, and activated by known techniques. A variety of supporting materials have been utilized with varying degrees of success. Metal type e lectrodes, such as nickel electrodes, for instance, can be made which are permeable to gaseous fuel, such as hydrogen, and are relatively easy to fabricate. They are, however, susceptible to corrosive attack by strong acid electrolytes, such as phosphoric acid, causing shortened life, substantial maintenance expense and attendant variations in output. Alternatively, carbon electrodes with applied precious metal catalysts have been used with some success. In addition, the output voltage of such cells tends to fluctuate and progressingly decrease due to direct or indirect effect of sintering effect on the precious metal and or carbon carrier. When Group VIII metal containing compositions, particularly platinum electrocatalytic compositions, are applied to carbon supports, reduced and used as a cathode in a phosphoric acid fuel cell system, ref. J. Electrochem Soc. 127 1219, 1980 , the surface area of the precious metal catalyst progressively decreases, shortening the efficient operating life span of the electrode and necessitating the added expense and inconvenience of built in over capacity. This problem is sometimes referred to as Sintering , and is believed caused by the migration of small precious metal ç.g. platinum crystallites across the electrode surface with the formation of larger crystallite masses. The resulting loss of active metal surface area is correlated to progressive loss in cell output and overall efficiency. Previous attempts at improving electrodes for use in fuel cells in general have been to alloy a platinum group metal with some other metal such as vanadium, aluminum, chromium, and the like, c.f. U.S. 4,202,934 and 4,186,110. Other attempts have been to deposit secondary metals, oxides and hydroxides on top of and around an already deposited platinum c.f. U.S. 4,137,372 and 4,081,409. Still others have deposited a plurality of metal salts and reduced them to the actual metals c.f.U.S. 3,340,097. Canadian 1,070,290 claims a method for the production of an anode for a fuel cell by applying a cocatalyst to the surface of a catalytic metal by covering the catalytic metal with a layer of hydrogen and then immersing it into a non etching solution of a soluble form of the co catalyst i.e. metal, oxide or hydroxide, with the co catalyst forming a discontinuous layer. It is an object of the present invention to minimize or avoid acid phosphoric electrolyte induced corrosion of electrodes in phosphoric acid fuel cells and fully utilize the potential of carbon supported Group VIII precious metal electrodes operating in such cells under the corrosive conditions. It is a further specific object of the present invention to minimize sintering of platinum carbon coated electrodes operating in excess of 3000F in fuel cells using phosphoric acid electrolyte. The above objects are achieved by use of an electrode which comprises a a support, such as wetproofed graphite paper, metal, tungsten carbide, and the like b a corrosion resistant, to phosphoric acid, conductive carbon carrier, such as conductive heattreated carbon powder or carbon black or tungsten carbide and the like c a catalyst material deposited on said carrier wherein the catalyst material is a mixture of at least one Group VIII precious metal, i.e. platinum, and an electrode improving amount of at least one oxide of chromium, gallium, germanium, zirconium, niobium, hafnium, tantalum, and tungsten and d a wet proofing binder. Preferably, the oxide is selected from germanium oxide, gallium oxide, tantalum oxide and tungsten oxide.Most preferably, it is either tungsten or tantalum oxide.There is no alloy of the metal of the oxide and the GroupVIII precious metal. Generally, the electrode improving amount of the oxide is less than about 30 by weight of the weight of the carrier. Preferably, less than about 20 , more preferably, less than about 15 . It has been found, particularly when the oxide is germanium oxide, that too large quantities of the oxide may be detrimental to extending the life of the electrode and that washing the coated carrier with hot water to remove some of the oxide has resulted in improved results. The Group VIII metal is used in catalytic amounts.Generally, this will be from about 0.1 to 30 , preferably, about 4 to 20 , and most preferably, about 5 to 15 , all by weight based on the weight of the carrier. The catalyst coated carrier particles are then combined with binders such as Teflon solutions tetrafluoroethylene or other polymeric materials to provide a waterproof structure for the carrier particles wet proofing binder , and the mixture is then deposited onto a support such as a Teflon wetproofed graphite paper or piece of metal. In general, the Group VIII catalyst metal loading on the support will be in the range of about 0.1 to 2 mg cm2 of support, preferably, about 0.2 to 1 mg cm2, and most preferably, about 0.3 to 0.7 m Carrier materials suitable for use in the present invention are generally a form of powdered activated carbon or conductive carbon black such as VulcanTM XC72R, XC72, Columbian Conductex 975, or the like.These carrier materials will generally have a surface area of from about 60 300 mê g and a particle size of about 0.5 50 microns. These materials are generally prewashed in mild acetic acid and then slurried in acidified deionized water containing the catalytic metal and the metal oxides which are to be deposited thereon. Group VIII precious metal components of catalyst material within the scope of the present invention such as above noted are conveniently applied to the carrier from a solution, and then reduced and dried as desired. The Group VIII precious metal component is applied as a solution, either along with the metal oxide component or in separate solutions, to powdered conductive carbon carrier which is, in turn, deposited or supported on graphite such as a monolith or graphite paper. For germanium oxide, it is preferable to use a single solution of the Group VIII metal and the oxide. Deposition of the catalyst coated carrier onto the support is conveniently effected by suspending the carrier in a liquid such as water and directly depositing the wetted particles onto the support by filtration techniques or, alternatively, by applying it as a dry powder to a porous support and then wetting the surface by drawing water or electrolyte through the support. The Group VIII catalytic metals are generally used in the form of an acid or salt such as chloroplatinic acid, a chloroplatinate, solubilized H2Pt OH 6, or the like. Preferably, the metal is platinum and, most preferably, it is used as solubilized H2Pt OH 6. The metal oxide component, which is deposited along with or after deposition of the catalytic metal, is generally dissolved in various acids such as acetic, hydrochloric, or nitric, or in dilute bases such as ammonium hydroxide. The following compounds may be used to provide the metal oxide germanium oxide, tungstic acid, chromium chloride, zirconyl nitrate, zirconyl chloride, gallium nitrate, niobium oxalate, hafnium nitrate, tantalum oxalate, and the like. Thus, either the oxide itself may be used or a compound which dissolves and can be converted to form the oxide. The above described invention provides an improved electrode for phosphoric acid type fuel cells in that the resultant fuel cell has a longer operating life. Also there is a reduction in metal migration and a reduction in the loss of active metal surface area.
