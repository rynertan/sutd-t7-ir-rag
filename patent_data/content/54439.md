# Character segmentation method.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a character segmentation method for use with an optical character reader for sequen tially reading postal code, state name and city name postal information, and for generating signals which represent character masks of each character. The system then calcu lates the gap between each mask and determines if it is greater than an average gap value calculated for all the masks. A determination is also made if a substantially smaller mask representing a punctuation mark exists between the two masks. These determinations are used to identify and separate the blocks of information. Once the blocks are identified, the block containing the postal code is classified since it necessarily contains five characters and the two remaining blocks i.e. state and city are classified since they, having been scanned in sequence, follow the postal code. Once classified, this information is used to faciliate the character recognition process since standard patterns of an alphabetical nature can be selected when the state name and city number are being recognized, and standard patterns of a numerical nature when the postal code is being recognized.
