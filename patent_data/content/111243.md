# Device for clamping the split portion of a split heat shrinkable sleeve.

## Abstract
A clamping device for clamping a split heat shrinkable sleeve placed around the joint between the core conductors of two communication cables which are to be joined or spliced together. The sleeve has two upstanding lugs or flanges on either side of the split in the sleeve. The holding strips are placed against the outer surface of the lugs. Each strip consists of two foldable link assemblies joined to opposite ends of a straight, rigid center portion or line. A connecting rod is initially inserted through sleeves on each strip to keep the strip straight during placement against the lugs. Clamping springs are rotatably mounted on one strip, and, after placement of the strip, the springs are rotated over both strips, thereby forcing the lugs into contact with each other. The rods are then removed. When the split sleeve shrinks upon the application of heat thereto, the link assemblies fold or pivot to accomodate the resulting defor mation of the sleeve, whereby the strips and springs continue clamping the lugs together until the sleeve com pletes its shrinkage.
