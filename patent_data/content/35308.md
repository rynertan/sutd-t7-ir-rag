# Wind direction indicator.

## Abstract
In closehauled sailing it is important to steer a constant angle to the apparant wind for optimum windward result. In light weather, in a swell and at night, a steering aid is essential for this sailing. The instrument suggested is selfcontained, easily visible in the field of view of the helmsman and reacts on off course angles as small as 1 . A cagelike rotor 1 with radial blades 4 is surrounded by a contrasting helical band 5 barber s pole in a transparent drum with vertical slits 2 . Air flowing through the device will turn the rotor either di rection except for a neutral direction at which the rotor stands still. With a properly adjusted instrument the helmsman has to steer for minimum rotor movement. A tacho generator coupled to the rotor facilitates remote indication or selfsteering. Sensitivity may be controlled by outflow of the device.

## Description
WINODIRECTION INDICATOR. The invention relates to a winddirection indicator especially suited for sailing boats when sailing closehauled.In order to obtain the maximum projected boat speed in the true winddirection velocity made good to windward it is i important when sailing closehauled to steer a rather constant angle to the apparant wind. The apparant wind is the wind observed on board and which is the vectorial sum of true wind speed and boatspeed. A modern sailing yacht is capable of sailing with an angle to the true wind as small as 400 to 459 The velocity made good to windward Vmg , shows an optimum at an apparant windangle of around 300. This optimum apparant windangle is nearly a ships constant. The helsman has to steer this constant angle to the apparant wind for the best result.As the wind varies continuously in strength and direction and as also the boatspeed is not constant a dynamic optimizing proces is needed when steering closehauled. The following aids are available for this proces. 1. The rather individual sense for close hauled sailing. Even in the dark it is possible to know and feel when the ship is sailing about right. 2. The simple windvane or burgee in the masttop eventually provided with some indicators for windward sailing. 3. The masttop windvane with electrical transducer for remote winddirection indication. 4. Woolen threads, tufts or telltales on both sides of the foresail, close to the leading edge, indicating optimal airflow for maximum drive when laying parallel to the sail.The aforementioned methods all have their specific advantages and disadvantages especially as regards cost, precision, readability. Inaccuracies may become unacceptable however in light wheather when there is a swell running and when sailin a night. The invention co bines the following recuirezents low cost. simple maintenance. visual indication in the fie3d of view of the helmsman. suitable for sailing at night. high precision 10 to 20 . very clear steering indication, also in light wheather and in a swell at either tack, starboard or port. easily adjustable for optimum apparant windangle. robust. The invention is characterized by a cage like rotor provided with radial blades rotating around a vertical spindle and surrounded by a stationary cylindrical drum provided with at least one vertical slit and another opening to allow the air to pass the rotorblades in such a way that the direction and speed of rotation of the rotor forms an indication of the deviation of the winddirection with respect to some neutral direction determined by the position of the slit at which the rotor stands still. The invention is based on the following principle.A rotating cage is used in stead of a stationary winddirection indicator. The direction of rotation of the cage is determined by the winddirection. By means of a helical strip barber s pole this direction of rotation is visualized. The rotor consists of a cage with e.g. 12 radial blades parallel to the rotor axis. Placing this rotor with its axis vertical in a windfield will not have any effect, however surrounding this rotor with a transparant cylindrical drum with suitable vertical slits there may be created a plane of syms.etry through the axis of the rotor. If now the wind arrives at an angle to this plane of symmetry the rotor will start to rotate. By proper shaping and positioning of these slits the sensitivity and the reversing points of the rotation may be chosen. Furthermore one may choose for a close or counter clock wise helical indicator band on the rotor relating the direction of rotation to the steer correction to be carried out over starboard or port respectively. For example an upward helical rotation could be correlated with an indication to sail more close winded pointing higher and reverse. It is practical to have an indicator for each tack with a clock and a counterclock rotor indicator respectively. Thus the indicators may be individually adjusted for optimum result. The invention will be explained by means of a drawing showing examples of application. The indicator according to the invention consists of a rotor 1 and a stator 2, which have, for the sake of clearness, been drawn vertically separated. The rotor is provided with a vertical spindle 3 and a number of radial inward pointed blades or lamellae 4. Besides a contrasting helical band or strip 5 is fastened to the blades or is painted on the blades, facilitating the observation of the direction of rotation of the rotor. The stator 2 is a cylindrical transparant vertical drum containing two diametricalls, opposed slits 6 and 7 to allow the wind to pass. In the bottom and the top of the drum glassbearings 8 are fitted to receive the rotor spindle 3. The bottom of the drum contains draining holes 9 for possible spray water. In use the rotor 1 will rotate freely around spindle 3 supported by the glassbearings 8 which are mounted in the drum 2. The rotor will be made of light weight material, whilst its inertia will be chosen in accordance with the steering response tie of the ship. often the winddirection coincides with a plane through the centrelines of the slits 6 and 7 the rotorblades will experience equal but opposing forces, consequently the rotor will stand still. This direction will be referred to as neutral or reference direction .The indicator is put on board of the ship and adjusted in such a way that its neutral direction corresponds with the optimum angle that the ship sailing closehauled should follow. In other words the plane through the centrelines of the slits 6 and 7 of the drum is directed at an angle of between 270 to 330 ship dependent to the longitudinal axis of the ship. If now the winddirection deviates from the neutral or reference direction the rotor willxsoart rotating clock or counterclockwise which is made visible b means of t helical band 5 showing a strives oa twa o of U Of ard. As long as the helmsman achieves steering a course with a minimum rotor movement he will be close to the neutral or reference course. In strong winds the sensitivity of the indicator may be reduced by decreasing the width w of the wind opposing slit 7. This width may also be controlled by using a second surrounding cylindrical drum with similar slits and turning the drums relative to one another not drawn . It is also possible to construct an indicator with two neutral or reference directions so that with one and the same indicator closehauled sailing at either tack is feasible. Three slits will be needed for this modification viz. one for starboard, one for port and one at the backside of the drum. The advantage of one single indicator is partly offset by a reduced senSitivity and a more difficult visibility for the helmsman. Except direct visualization by a helical band or strip 5 an electrical tacho generator may be coupled to the rotor enabling electronic processing for remote indication or controlling a selfsteering device .
