# Polyester composition.

## Abstract
A polyester composition comprising A 100 parts by weight of a substantially linear polyester comprising, as the main constituent unit, ethylene tereph thalate B 0.05 to 15 parts by weight of a crystallization pro motor and C 0.1 to 15 parts by weight of at least one plasticizer selected from the group consisting of C₁ , C₂ , C₃ and C₄ which are defined as follows C₁ a condensation product of a compound of the formula I HQ R ₂S I wherein two R groups may be the same as or different from each other and represent a hydrocarbon group selected from the group consisting of aliphatic, alicyclic, and aromatic hydro carbon groups and any combination thereof, and two Q groups may be the same as or different from each other and represent oxygen or sulfur, with an organic compound containing two alcoholic or phenolic hydroxyl groups. C₂ an ester compound derived from an organic acid and a compound selected from the group consisting of compounds of the above mentioned formula I and the condensation products C₁ . C₃ an ether compound derived from a compound select ed from the group consisting of compounds of the above men tioned formula I and the condensation products C₁ and a compound selected from the group consisting of monohydric alcohols and monohydric phenols. C₄ a modified polyolefin wax selected from oxidized polyolefin waxes, unsaturated carboxylic acid or its derivative graft modified polyolefin waxes, unsaturated epoxy com pound modified polyolefin waxes, unsaturated silane com pound modified pololefin waxes, and styrene type monomer modified olefin waxes.
