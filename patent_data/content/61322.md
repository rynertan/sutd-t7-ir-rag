# ALLOY COATED METAL STRUCTURE HAVING EXCELLENT RESISTANCE TO HIGH TEMPERATURE CORROSION AND THERMAL SHOCK

## Abstract
A metal structure having excellent resistance to high temperature corrosion and thermal shock, comprising an alloy coating consisting essentially of 10 to 35 weight of Cr, 5 to 25 weight of Al and 5 to 30 weight of at least one element selected from the group consisting of Nb, Zr and Mn, the balance being at least one selected from the group of Fe, Ni and Co. Alternatively, the allow coating may addi tionally contain 0.01 to 30 weight of at least one element selected from the group consisting of Y, Sc and rare earth metals and may further contain 5 to 30 weight of Ta and 0.005 to 0.8 weight of B. The metal structure is suitable for use in gas turbine blades and nozzles.
