# Gelatin silver photographic elements for tanning development.

## Abstract
Silver halide photographic elements for tanning de velopment including tanning developers, which can diffuse into the gelatin layer containing them, can be improved if they are associated with non diffusing hydroquinones. In the case where such tanning developer is hydroquinone or a derivative thereof, said elements include such diffusing hydroquinone associated with a hydroquinone derivative non diffusing in the gelatin layer containing it. Such non diffusing hydroquinones preferably are hydroquinones sub stituted with aliphatic chains containing a total of at least twelve carbon atoms and, more preferably, are dispersed in the layer dissolved in a high boiling organic solvent.
