# EPOXIDIZED EPDM AS IMPACT MODIFIER FOR THERMOPLASTIC POLYESTER

## Abstract
An impact modified thermoplastic molding composition having improved compatibility and other physical properties such as flexural strength, tensile strength and flexural modulus is provided, the composition comprising 1 a thermoplastic resin selected from the group consisting of a high molecular weight linear polyester, a high molecular weight copolyester and a high molecular weight block copolyester, 2 from about 5 to 25 by weight, based on the total composition, of epoxidized EPDM and 3 optionally, 5 to 25 by weight, based on the total composition, of an aromatic polycarbonate resin and or up to about 50 by weight, based on the total composition, glass filaments or other reinforcing agents.
