# INTRODUCING CATHETER

## Abstract
An introducing catheter 10 for use in placing a large guidewire 48 after a small guidewire 46 is in position. The catheter has a tapered distal tip 18 , decreased lumen size at the distal end, a side port 20 and a ramp 26 disposed within the tube at the distal end of the side port. The ramp is inclined distally toward the side port, the distal end 30 of the ramp being fixed to the tube adjacent to the side port and the proximal end 31 of the ramp being disposed adja cent the inner wall 32 of the tube in the region opposite the side port in the manner that the small guidewire can move proximally past the ramp. The ramp deflects the distally moving larger wire so that it exists through the side port. In the embodiment shown, the ramp is formed integrally of low friction thermoplastic PTFE and the upper surface of the proximal end of the ramp has a convex, wire deflecting contour as a result of thermoforming pressure.
