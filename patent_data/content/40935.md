# Oxygen adsorbent and process for the separation of oxygen and nitrogen using same.

## Abstract
Oxygen adsorbent for adsorbing oxygen from a two component mixed gas consisting essentially of oxygen and nitrogen which comprises a substantially pure Na A type zeolite having dissolved therein at least divalent iron or the iron dissolved Na A type zeolite a portion of Na of which is substituted with K. A process for the separation of a two component mixed gas consisting essentially of oxygen and nitrogen into oxygen and nitrogen which comprises pas sing the two component mixed gas through a layer filled with the above oxygen adsorbent in a low temperature region below room temperature and adsorbing oxygen selectively with the adsorbent is also disclosed. Further, a process for the separation of a two component mixed gas consisting essentially of oxygen and nitrogen into oxygen and nitrogen is disclosed which comprises passing the two component mixed gas through a layer filled with the above adsorbent in a low temperature region below room temperature at a relatively high pressure, adsorbing oxygen selectively with the adsorbent, collecting nitrogen gas, and then collecting the adsorbed oxygen by reducing the pres sure in the layer filled with the adsorbent to a relatively low level.
