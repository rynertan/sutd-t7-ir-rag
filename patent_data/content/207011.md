## Description
The present invention relates to a novel therapeutical utilization of some alkanoyl L carnitines. More specifically, it relates to the use of alkanoyl L carnitines having general formula wherein R is selected from acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, hydroxybutyryl, and their pharmacologically acceptable salts, to manufacture a medicament for the therapeutic treatment of idiopathic Parkinson s disease and a syndrome similar to idiopathic parkinsonism induced by either self administration of some illicit drug preparations or organism s exposure to an environment polluted by these drugs. This invention also relates to orally or parenterally administrable pharmaceutical compositions comprising the above identified alkanoyl L carnitines as active principles for the treatment of the previously mentioned pathologies. In the description which follows, reference will be made, for the sake of simplicity, to acetyl L carnitine, it being, however, understood, that the disclosures concerning this specific compound equally apply to the other mentioned alkanoyl derivatives of carnitine. Previous therapeutical uses of acetyl L carnitine and other alkanoyl derivatives of carnitine are already known. For instance, US patent 4,194,006 discloses the use of acetyl carnitine in the therapeutical treatment of myocardial arrythmias and ischemias. The US patent 4,343,816 discloses the use of acetyl carnitine in the therapeutic treatment of functional peripheral vascular diseases of arteries, such as Reynaud s disease and acrocyanosis. The US patent 4,346,107 discloses the therapeutical effectiveness of acetyl carnitine in the treatment of patients suffering from impaired cerebral metabolism as in senile and pre senile dementia. There is no relationship at all, however, between the already known therapeutic utilizations of the previously mentioned alkanoyl L carnitines and the novel utilization which is the subject matter of the present invention. This will appear more evident from the description which follows when reference is made to some recent studies which lead one to hypothesize a toxic cause for Parkinson s disease. It is well known that, although Parkinson s disease is generally regarded as an idiopathic condition, parkinsonism symptoms may develop as a result of certain drug overdose, such as phenothiazines, butyrophenones and reserpine. Recently, Parkinsonism has been studied in drug addicts who had self injected meperidine like compounds whose illicit synthesis had produced MPTP and MPPP as side products. In fact, 1 methyl 4 phenyl 1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine MPTP or NMPTP and 1 methyl 4 phenyl 4 propoxy piperidine MPPP selectively destroy dopaminergic neurons in the The present therapy of choice for the treatment of parkinsonism is the administration of Levodopa L dopa , the metabolic precursor of dopamine which itself does not cross the blood brain barrier. Levodopa must be administered in large doses because most of the drug is metabolized before it reaches its sites of action in the brain. L dopa is, therefore, administered in combination with carbidopa, a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor which prevents the systemic metabolism of levodopa before it reaches the brain. If levodopa is administered alone, side effects are experienced, such as anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and orthostatic hypotension which remarkably subside, however, as soon as also carbidopa is administered. After a few months of L dopa therapy, even though it is administered in combination with the decarboxylase inhibitor, further bothersome side effects, such as dyskinesias of the face, trunk and limbs, may be experienced. The onset of these dyskinesias shows that the drug dose has reached a critical threshold which should not be exceeded. However, L dopa s most serious drawback is that its early effectiveness subsides with time a progressive worsening of symptomatology ensues after 3 to 7 years of continuous therapy. Moreover, as the parkinsonism syndrome slowly worsens with time, the onset of fast clinical changes so called on off conditions is frequently noticed an almost normal mobility on conditions for 1 2 hours following L dopa administration reverses to a substantially complete akinesia off condition . These on off conditions are never detected before the beginning of L dopa therapy. This progressive loss of effectiveness and the onset of on off conditions raise the problem of the after dopa therapy early treatment of the disease with anticholinergic agents only administration of the minimum effective dose of L dopa use of L dopa in combination with bromocriptine and ergoline derivatives, such as lergotrile, pergolide and lisuride. However, also these pharmaceuticals present bothersome drawbacks. For instance, bromocriptine side effects are similar to those of L dopa. In some cases, these side effects, emotional disturbances, vertigos, erythromelalgia are so apparent that the treatment must be interrupted. It has been now found that the use of an alkanoyl L carnitine of general formula wherein R is selected from acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, hydroxybutyryl, is effective for the manufacture of a medicament for the therapeutic treatment of both idiopathic parkinsonism and the idiopathic parkinsonism like syndromes induced by the administration of the above mentioned illicit drugs or the organism s exposure to an environment polluted by these drugs. The foregoing alkanoyl L carnitines do not present the above mentioned drawbacks, toxic and side effects of L dopa and the other pharmaceuticals currently used for the treatment of parkinsonism. The effectiveness of the foregoing alkanoyl L carnitine is surprising insofar as there is no structural relationship between them and L dopa or the other mentioned pharmaceuticals. The preventive and protective effect of acetyl L carnitine has been assessed through experimental studies carried out on Rhesus monkeys Macaca fascicularis and Macaca mulatta . One of these studies is illustrated hereinbelow. The Parkinson like syndrome was induced in the experiment animals following the procedure disclosed by Cohen et al. in European Journal of Pharmacology 35 Cynomolgus monkeys Macaca fascicularis , weighing 2.1 2.8 kg were used in this study. Eight monkeys were used as controls. 18 monkeys MPTP monkeys were administered 0.35 mg kg i.v. once a day of 1 methyl 4 phenyl 1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine MPTP, free base for 4 consecutive days. All the 18 animals developed parkinsonism, the typical symptoms appearing 2 to 4 days after administration. The symptoms were anorexia after 2 days , bradykinesia, tremor after 3 4 days , freezing and lack of facial expression after 3 5 days . 9 days after MPTP administration the animals showed sharp alterations in the acoustical, visual and somatosensory bioelectrical evoked responses. It was found that MPTP had reduced the amplitude of these responses by 70 . The response latency increased by 25 60 msec. One monkey acetyl L carnitine prior MPTP monkey , which was then treated with MPTP as previously described, was administered a single dose of acetyl L carnitine 5 mg kg i.m. 3 days before the first MPTP administration. This animal develop the first symptom i.e. anorexia after 11 days. Bradykinesia, freezing, tremor and lack of facial expression developed only after 13 days. Other six monkeys MPTP acetyl L carnitine monkeys which were then treated with MPTP as previously described, were administered acetyl L carnitine 5 mg kg i.m. for 3 days before the first MPTP dose was administered. 5 mg kg i.m. of acetyl L carnitine were administered on the same days of the MPTP treatment. During the 5 days following the end of MPTP treatment, the animals were administered daily doses of acetyl L carnitine 5 mg kg i.m. . 60 days following the end of treatment with acetyl L carnitine, no animal had developed any Parkinsonism s symptom. All these monkeys showed normal evoked responses. In two monkeys MPTP delayed acetyl L carnitine monkeys MPTP was administered for 3 days as previously described. Acetyl L carnitine 20 mg kg were then injected i.m. for 20 days beginning on the 3rd day after the last MPTP administration. In these monkeys, decrement of food intake and bradykinesia appeared as early as in the monkeys which had been administered MPTP only. However, a steady reduction of symptoms was noticed already on the 21th day following the last MPTP injection. The MPTP monkeys were sacrificed 90 180 days following the last injection. The acetyl L carnitine prior MPTP monkey was sacrificed 30 days following the last MPTP injection. The MPTP delayed acetyl L carnitine monkeys were sacrificed 60 days following the last MPTP injection. The MPTP acetyl L carnitine monkeys were sacrificed 60 350 days following the last injection. On the day of sacrifice the animals were killed by sodium pentobarbital,the brains and eyes were excised and frozen at 20 C. Biochemical and neuropathological studies performed in the sacrificed animals showed a decrement of dopamine and homovanilic acid in the caudate, striatum and neuronal loss of as much as 90 in MPTP monkey and in the ALC prior MPTP monkey ALC acetyl L carnitine . The same measurements were inside normal limits in MPTP ALC monkeys. In the MPTP delayed ALC monkeys post mortem measurements showed a 40 decrement of dopamine in the striatum and 30 neuronal loss in the nigra. Further studies have ascertained that, although the daily dose to be administered depends on the age, weight and general condition of the subject, utilizing sound professional judgement, generally, from 1 to 30 mg of acetyl L carnitine kg of body weight day is a suitable dose. Acetyl L carnitine is compounded into the pharmaceutical compositions by using the usual excipients which are well known in pharmaceutical technology for preparing orally and parenterally administrable compositions. It has also been found that a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form which is particularly suited for the foregoing therapeutical utilization comprises from 50 to 1,000, mg of acetyl L carnitine. Some examples of pharmaceutical compositions suitable for oral and parenteral administration are illustrated herebelow
