# Cardiac pacer having input output circuit programmable for use with unipolar and bipolar pacer leads.

## Abstract
An implantable cardiac pacer having atrial and ventricu lar electrodes includes an input output circuit which can be programmed for use with either unipolar and bipolar pacer leads. The circuit can be programmed by the physician after implant to accomodate physiological changes in the patient or chronic changes in pacer lead characteristics, and can also be utilized with cardiac pacers having a single ventricular or atrial electrode.
