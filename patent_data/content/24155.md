# Apparatus for measurement of body substances and enzyme implants for use therein.

## Abstract
Apparatus suitable for use in a cutaneous method of analysing body substrates comprising i an enzyme implant which is adapted for insertion into the body of a mammal and contains an enzyme which is reactable with the substrate to be measured to produce a detectable change in the skin of the mammal, and ii analysing means for analysing said change in the skin as a measure of the amount of substrate in the body. A condition of the skin may be used to measure a number of important substances which diffuse through or are present within the skin. The enzyme implant is implanted in the skin and enzymatic reaction with the substrate to be measured takes place, the by products being detected as a measure of the amount of substrate. Measurements of oxygen, hydrogen peroxide and carbon dioxide levels may be taken using polarographic electrodes and colorimetric detection may also be used.
