# Line output circuit for generating a line frequency sawtooth current.

## Abstract
In a line deflection circuit a trace capacitor C2 , a linearity control inductor L3 and associated parallel resistor R1 , a pre set width control inductor L1 and associated parallel resistor R2 , and a line deflection coil Ly are connected in series across the terminals of a controlled switch formed by the emitter and collector electrodes of a transistor TR . A flyback capacitor C3 is also connected across the above electrodes of the transistor TR . A series efficiency flyback boosting circuit comprising the transistor TR , the primary winding P of a transformer T , a boost capacitor C1 and a diode D1 is used to energise the deflection circuit. The transformer T has an EHT secondary winding S which with a diode D2 provides an EHT supply for the final anode of a display tube not shown . A further pre set inductor L2 is connected between the lower termin al of the secondary winding S and earth, the adjustment means for inductor L2 being ganged with that for width control inductor L1 and arranged so that as the inductance of one increases the inductance of the other also increases.
