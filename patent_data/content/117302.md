Following washing, the tissues were incubated for one hour with the test compound and then a second histamine concentrationresponse curve was run. Shifts to the right of the agonist concentration response curve produced by the antagonists were used to construct Schild plots Arunlakshana, 0. and Schild, H.O., Br. J. Pharmacol. 14, 48 58, 1959 . Regression of Log dry on Log B , where dr is an equiactive response in the presence and absence of antagonist and B is the molar concentration of antagonist, allowed an estimate of pA2, i.e. the negative log of the concentration of antagonist which shifts the control histamine concentration response curve 2X to the right.

In vivo Antihistaminic Activity Guinea pigs Hartley, male, 300 350 g were fasted for 20 hours and then dosed p.o. or i.p. with the test compound. One hour after dosing, on an individual basis, the guinea pigs were placed in a clear plastic chamber which was saturated and continually gassed with 0.25 histamine from an aerosol nebulizer. The guinea pigs were monitored for signs of histamine anaphylaxis e.g. cough, sneeze, strong abdominal movements, cyanoses or loss of righting . Under the test conditions, control animals collapsed on average within 33 seconds. ED50 s for protection against histamine were calculated by pro bit analysis. In this test the ED50 indicates that at that particular dose 50 of the animals were completely protected against histamine challenge at the time of testing 1 hour post dosing .Complete protection was defined as no histamine symptoms for six minutes in the aerosol chamber approximately 10X the collapse time of the control animals . Table I Results of Antihistamine Assays Compound ED50 mg kg, p.o. Triprolidine 5.77 A 1.7 B 0.3 4 hours Fast dosing In addition to these results, it was found that Compound A could provide very long durations of antihistaminic activity e.g. 11 mg kg p.o. is the ED50 for 24 hours protection . Anaphylactoid Testing ProcedureNon fasted, Wister rats 180 3009 were dosed with the test compound, i.p. or p.o. 2 hours before compound 48 80 challenge. One hour prior to challenge, 5 mg kg i.p, of propranolol was administered. The anaphylactoid inducing agent, compound 48 80, was given intravenously at 2 mg kg and the animals were monitored for symptoms of respiratory distress.Data were analyzed by Probit determinations. the response was quantitated by determining the dose of test compound which protected 50 of the animals from death at a given time point.The above experimental design does not give positive results for selective antihistamines. Also rats do not respond to histamine i.v. with symptoms of anaphylaxis. Agents which block the effects of compound 48 80 are commonly classified as inhibitors of anaphylactic mediators or inhibitors of the release of anaphylic mediators Inhibition of Compound 48 80 Induced Anaphylactoid Reaction Compound E050 Ketotifen 0.8 A 2.64 B 0.89 1.2 C 1,43 E 3.11 Astemizole 1.08 Dose of compound i p. providing 50 protection against death induced by compound 48 80.
