## Description
TITLE PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR THERMOREMANENT DUPLICATION OF MAGNETIC TAPES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to an improved method for the thermoremanent duplication of magnetic tapes using radiant heating and contact cooling with applied pressure, controlled tension, and precision tape guidance. Currently, the videotape industry duplicates videotapes at substantial expense by using many copiers to electronically reproduce from a master tape at normal slow playback speed. The master tape is run in real time while up to 1000 copiers in one room record the information. A need exists for a reproduction method which is faster and less costly. Magnetic tapes have been previously reproduced by anhysteretic contact printing in which the master tape and the copy are placed in face to face contact and exposed to a decaying a. c. magnetic field. Herr et al. U.S.Ps 2,738,383 . Reproduction by this means, however, requires high coercivity master tapes and transfers signals weaker than those present in the master. Also previously proposed has been a method of duplication involving thermoremanent transfer wherein the blank copy magnetic tape is heated above its Curie point and thereafter cooled in intimate contact with the prerecorded master tape whereby the signals of the master are transferred to the copy tape. Greiner et al. Re 28,290 Daly et al. U.S.P.3,612,103 Hoell U.S.P. 3,699,267 Lemke U.S.P.3,541,577 Kumada U.S.P. 3,465,105, Kobayashi et al.U.S.P 3,824,617. Thermoremanent reproduction has the advantage that the copied magnetic recording may have an even greater intensity of signal than that of the original. However disadvantages in previous thermal remanent copying systems have included 1 overheating of the base film resulting in physical distortions which produce electronic timing errors during playback and 2 high frequency roll off, that is the loss in transfer of high frequencies, due to the inadequate contact pressure between master and copy. One attempt to control overheating of the base film and prevent high frequency roll off has been using a finely focussed laser beam to provide rapid localized heating of the copy tape magnetizable particles to a temperature above their Curie point.The laser spot size is approximately 5 jim commensurate with the magnetic particle size. A scanning laser beam to cover the entire tape width is required Stanel U.S.P. 3,761,645 . SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a process for replicating a magnetic pattern onto a moving flexible magnetizable recording member containing a particulate layer with chromium dioxide particles on a flexible support transparent to a beam of energy which comprises a passing the magnetizable recording member and a flexible prerecorded magnetizable medium through a nip of two rolls, one of said rolls being transparent to the beam of energy and facing the recording member and at least one of said rolls being compressible, the chromium dioxide particles facing said prerecorded magnetizable medium, b passing a continuous beam of energy through the transparent roll and the flexible support of the magnetizable recording member to simultaneously heat chromium dioxide particles across a width of the recording member on which a magnetic particle is to be replicated for a time period in the range of from .01 to 5 milliseconds while in said nip and in contact with the prerecorded magnetizable medium, said chromium dioxide particles being heated to above their Curie temperature, c cooling the chromium dioxide particles to below their Curie temperature while in intimate contact with the prerecorded medium in said nip for a time period in the range from 0.1 to 100 milliseconds. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The Figure is a stylized representation of an apparatus for duplicating prerecorded master magnetic tape. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention chromium dioxide particles of a recording member, contact a prerecorded magnetizable medium in a nip of two rolls. The recording member is also referred to herein as a copy tape while the prerecorded magnetizable medium is also referred to as a master tape. Heating of the chromium dioxide particles to at least the Curie temperature takes place, i.e., the temperature where the magnetic particles lose their magnetization. Thereafter cooling of the chromium dioxide particles occurs in the nip of the two rolls while in contact with the master tape to orient the magnetic domains of the chromium dioxide material to the magnetization pattern of recorded information on the master tape.In the present invention both the heating and cooling steps take place while the recording member containing chromium dioxide particles and the prerecorded master are in contact in a nip of two rolls. Heating of the chromium dioxide particles to the Curie temperature prior to entry into the nip does not take place. The chromium dioxide particles are embedded in a polymer matrix, typically a polyurethane elastomer and this coating is supported on a flexible material which is transparent to a beam of energy used for heating. In the present context the material allows at least a significant quantity of the energy beam to pass without being absorbed to allow heating of the chromium dioxide particles and minimize the heating of the flexible material. The energy source which is used to heat the chromium dioxide coating is dependent on the flexible material used to support the particles. Suitable heating sources include incandescent and electrical discharge lamps, with laser heating preferred. Suitable support materials include polyester, polyolefin, cellulose and other traditional photographic and magnetic support media. Since heating of the chromium dioxide particles takes place while in the nip of two rolls, the energy beam by necessity must pass through the roll supporting the recording member. The source of the beam of energy can be placed inside this roll but more preferably is outside the roll and the beam is controlled by an optical system. The material of this roll must likewise be transparent to the beam of energy in addition to the support for the chromium dioxide particles. The heating source, preferably a laser, emits a continuous beam of energy which simultaneously heats the chromium dioxide particles across a width of the recording member on which the magnetic pattern is to be replicated. 11simultaneously11 in the present context excludes traversal, such as a scanning pattern, of the energy beam across the recording member. The width of the recording member which is to receive the magnetic pattern is heated simultaneously without deflection of the energy pattern in a scanning mode. It is necessary in the present invention that one of the two rolls is compressible, i.e., it provides a footprint to extend nip contact between the rolls sufficient to keep the recording member and prerecorded magnetizable medium in a pressure contact during the heating and cooling steps. The heating duration of the chromium dioxide particles will be in the range of .01 to 5 milliseconds and generally 0.1 to 0.4 milliseconds. Criticality is present in the need to maintain intimate pressure contact of the tapes during the heating and cooling steps. The cooling period of the chromium dioxide particles while in the nip and in contact with the prerecorded medium is in the range of 0.1 to 100 milliseconds and generally 0.5 to 4 milliseconds.The duration of the time in the nip is dependent not only on the size and compressibility of one or more rolls, but also on the speed the tapes run through the nip. Typical tape speeds are 25 inches per second to 100 inches per second. One of the rolls forming the nip should be compressible. The pressure on the tapes in the nip generally will be at least 5 psi and conventionally will be in the range of 15 to 500 psi and more generally 50 to 250 psi. The heating and cooling steps which are both carried out in the nip have an advantage that elongation of a tape due to tension is minimized particularly due to softening of a polymeric support material at elevated temperature.Also one or both rolls can be cooled. Additionally adjustment of the rolls allows the pressure in the nip to be varied irrespective of the thickness of the two tapes. Referring to the Figure, the apparatus includes a master tape 11, a master feed reel 12, a master take up reel 13, a copy tape 14, a copy feed reel 15, and a copy take up reel 16. Conventional tape drive devices may be employed for driving reels 12, 13, 15 and 16 in the direction of movement as shown by arrows. Tape 11 fed from reel 12 and tape 14 fed from reel 15 are guided around idler rolls 17 and 18 respectively, past detector assembly 35, over tensiometers 19 and 20 respectively. Tape 11 passes under idler roll 21, and both tapes are brought together under guide roll 22, with magnetic surfaces in face to face contact. Tapes 11 and 14 travel together over cooled reference roll 23 through magnetic transfer assembly, generally designated as 24, where thermoremanent transfer of the information from the tape 11 to tape 14 occurs. The magnetic transfer assembly includes a print wheel 25 and a nip roll 26. Print wheel 25 is a cooled hollow transparent roll of 8 inch diameter. Cooling is both internal and external by dry chilled air of around 500F 10 C . The print wheel 25 can be made of polymethyl methacrylate with an internal antireflective coating. The print wheel 25 is hollow and transparent in order to pass a beam of energy 36, preferably laser light, to the outside of the wheel surface Nip roll 26 is a cooled, coated roll of 2 inch diameter. Cooling is both internal and external by dry, chilled air of around 50OF. Roll 26 can be coated with a elastomeric coating, such as 0.055 inch 1.140 cm A iprenesAdiprene NR polyurethane rubber. The area of contact of the print wheel 25 with nip roll 26 or footprint area is 0.10 0.254 cm . Pressure maintained in the nip roll assembly generally exceeds 100 psi. Tapes 11 and 14 exit the magnetic transfer assembly 24 passing over cooled reference roll 27, under guide roll 28, and are separated as tapes 11 and 14 continue over tensionmeters 31 and 32, respectively, around idler rolls 33 and 34, respectively to master take up reel 13 and copy take up reel 16 respectively. Reference rolls 23 and 27 on either side of magnetic transfer assembly 24 can have reference edges to provide edge guidance to the master and copy tapes so that they will track together for duplication. Magnetic pick up head 30 is a means for determining and controlling optimum machine speed at a given energy flux level for preferred signal transfer. Signals derived from the pick up head allow for adjustment in either machine speed or energy flux level. Detector assembly 35 is a means for determining the presence of tapes 11 and 14.Information derived from this assembly protects the nip roll 26 from damage due to the beam of energy.The beam is turned off when no tape is detected. The preferred laser beam for this invention is a neodymium doped yttrium aluminum garnet YAG emitting light of a single wavelength of 1.06 microns. The polyester base film is transparent to this laser wavelength and a temperature profile is established which is low throughout the support film width but high at the film particle interface. In this manner the copy film base exits the heating transfer zone only 250 to 600C higher than it entered, below the glass transition temperature of the polymer above which tape distortion could occur. The Nd Yag rod emits a 1 4 diameter beam which is then expanded through an up collimator, shaped into a rectangular pattern, redirected by two prisms and focused by a cylindrical lens to a line 1 2 x .010 which shines through the transparent print wheel surface onto the copy tape 14 and spans the tape width providing uniform power density distribution across the tape width. Master magnetic tape 11 consists preferably of a support of polyethylene terephthalate and a magnetizable layer of higher Curie point than the copy magnetizable layer such as iron alloy particles, cobalt modified iron oxide particles or Cr02 particles with elevated Curie temperatures. The copy magnetic tape 14 consists preferaby of a support of polyethylene terephthalate and a magnetic layer containing about 50 by volume ofCrO2 with Curie temperature of about 130 C. The master tape 11 may include information ranging in wavelength from .03 inches to 20 x 10 6 6 inches 0.076 cm to 50.8 x 10 cm . EXAMPLE The apparatus described in the Figure was used to copy a helical scan video pattern on 1 2 inch 1.27 cm tape from a metal particle mirror master to an unrecorded chromium dioxide copy tape. Heating was by an infrared laser beam projecting through the transparent roll and focusing into a narrow line across the tape. The copy tape was cooled in exact register with the master tape while constrained in the footprint of the nip and guided against the synchronization edge as a mechanical reference. The color video program was successfully reproduced with good color, definition, and tracking. Essentially no dimensional change in the polyester support of the copy tape was experienced.
