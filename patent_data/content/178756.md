# Improvements in contact lens cleaning apparatus.

## Abstract
A contact lens cleaning and disinfecting apparatus with a cavity 14 in which a contact lens is to be cleaned by an aqueous non chemosterilant liquid such as a saline solution. An ultra sonic transducer 20 applies vibrations to the cavity 14 . The oscillator driving the transducer includes a transfor mer feedback circuit using one or more cores of high magnetic permeability and low core loss to give a stable resonant frequency. A timer 34 may be driven from this resonant frequency. In one embodiment the cavity 14 and the sealing cap 16 may be removable together with the transducer 20 from the rest of the housing of the apparatus so that lenses can be transported conveniently after cleaning and before use. According to another embodiment the waste a heat from power transistors Q2, Q3 can be used to heat the cleaning liquid in the cavity.
