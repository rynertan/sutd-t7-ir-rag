# Method for fabricating an integrally bladed rotor.

## Abstract
A component, such as a turbine disk, made from a metal or metal alloy which has been processed to display super plastic properties at elevated temperatures, is diffusion bonded to a component or components, such as turbine blades, made from another metal or metal alloy, by dispos ing the components in a press with the surfaces to be bonded in mating contact. Moisture and oxygen are removed from between the surfaces. Heat and pressure are then applied, such as by forging at an elevated temperature or by hot isos tatic pressing, to cause superplastic deformation of at least one of the components at the bonding surfaces. The heat and pressure are held sufficiently long to diffusion bond the sur faces. The new integral assembly is then heat treated to ob tain desired properties. Consistently good diffusion bonds are achieved by this method.
