# Rapid extrusion of hot short sensitive alloys.

## Abstract
High strength aluminum alloys and other hot short sensitive alloys can be extruded at rapid rates through a cooled, double reduction die 3 without hot short cracking or scoring caused by die pickup. A primary reduction die 4 has a long, cooled primary land 5 and is followed by a secondary reduction die 6 . A metal billet 15 may be extruded through the primary die 4 at about the solidus temperature of its lowest melting phase, then cooled as it passes through the primary die land 5 to reduce or maintain the temperature below the solidus temperature and, finally, the primary extrusion is reduced in cross section in the secondary die 6 by about 2 50 . The temperature, the back pressure caused by the second reduction, and the low friction through the primary land 5 contribute to eliminate hot short cracks and minimize serious pickup scoring at surprising rates of at least about 18 meters per minute 60 ft min for 2024 aluminum rod.
