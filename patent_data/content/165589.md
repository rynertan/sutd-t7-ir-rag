## Description
Title of the InventionSecondary Battery and Method of Manufacturing the SameBackRround of the Invention The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a secondary battery and the manufactured secondary battery, and more particularly to the structure and fabricating method of an anode as veil as a cathode. In secondary batteries, it is known to construct an anode or a cathode by the use of a compound having a lamellar structure or a graphite interlayer compound. For example, the official gazette of Japanese PatentApplication Laying open No. 58 102464 discloses a secondary battery which employs a lithium graphite interlayer compound as the active material of a cathode, an FeC12 graphite interlayer compound as the active material of an anode, and a solid electrolyte. In this battery, lithium ions are emitted from the cathode and Fecal2 from the anode in the mode of discharge. The reverse reaction takes place in the mode of charge. Besides, an initial open circuit voltage of 3.5 volts, an average open circuit voltage of 3.3 volts and an average load current of 14 PA are attained in the mode of discharge.In the cited invention, however, the graphite interlayer compound which is prone to disintegrate when it contains moisture is used as the starting material in the manufacture of the secondary battery, so that care needs to be taken for the custody and handling of the graphite interlayer compound before being assembled into a battery envelope. In batteries which employ organic electrolytes, one employing carbon for both an anode and a cathode is also known. For example, a chargeable capacitor battery employing active carbon fiber electrodes is reported in J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun., page 1158 1982 . However, the charging and discharging reactions of this battery are based on the adsorption and desorption reactions of the electrolyte, and no graphite interlayer compound is formed.Summary of the Invention An object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a secondary battery which is free from the care of handling at the time of the manufacture and which has a battery performance equivalent or superior to that of a battery employing a graphite interlayer compound as a starting material for manufacture, and the secondary battery manufactured by the method. The present invention is characterized in that graphite which forms interlayer compounds by reacting with the anions and cations of an electrolyte resyectively in the mode of charge is employed for an anode and a cathode, and that the graphite in its form before producing the interlayer compounds is assembled into a battery envelope. According to the present invention, a secondary battery can be constructed in that state of graphite which is difficult to be integrated by moisture. After the construction, a performance as the battery can be demonstrated since charging, whereupon the performance as the battery can be demonstrated while both the anode and the cathode are switching between the states of the graphite and the interlayer compounds, so that a high battery performance can be ensured.In the sense that the electrodes are not disintegrated, the battery of the invention can be said higher in performance than a battery which is constructed in the states of graphite interlayer compounds from the beginning. In the secondary battery of the present invention, during charge, the reaction in which the graphite and the anions of the electrolyte react to form the graphite interlayer compound occurs at the anode, while the reaction in which the graphite and the cations of the electrolyte react to form the graphite interlayer compound occurs at the cathode. During discharge, the reaction occurs in which the anions being the intercalary material of the graphite interlayer compound of the anode and the cations being the intercalary material of the graphite interlayer compound of the cathode migrate toward the electrolyte to turn graphite of lamellar structure. In order to perform such reactions repeatedly every charge and discharge, it is necessary to mix the electrolyte with an organic solvent, for example, to dissolve the electrolyte in the solution of propylene carbonate being the organic solvent. There is also the effect that, although the graphite interlayer compound produced in the mode of charge disintegrates upon contact with water, it does not disintegrate upon contact with the organic solvent. Further, the stable potential width of the organic solvent is greater than that of water the theoretical decomposition voltage of water is 1.23 V , for example, the stable potential width of propylene carbonate is as sufficiently great as 3.3 V to 1.5 V vs AglAg in case of using a platinum plate as an electrode and the electrolyte in which LiC104 is dissolved at a concentration of I mol D so that the battery employing the electrolyte of the organic solvent is stable even at a high voltage. In the present invention, the battery should desirably have a sealed structure in order to prevent the graphite interlayer compounds from coming into contact with moisture in the atmosphere. a Construction of Anode and Cathode An anode or a cathode is constructed of graphite which forms an interlayer compound by reacting with the anions or cations of an electrolyte in the mode of charge. As such graphite, there is, for example, one which is obtained by once preparing the graphite interlayer compound and then removing an intercalary material therefrom or one which is put into a lamellar structure so that the graphite interlayer compound can be formed. Besides, there is a chemical method wherein graphite and lithium metal are enclosed in a pyrex glass tube under vacuum and are heated to form the graphite interlayer compound.It is of course possible to use the graphite produced by removing the intercalary material from the graphite interlayer compound obtained by the chemical method. As expedients for producing the graphite having the lamellar structure, all well known methods are applicable.For example, it is possible to apply a method which bakes carbon powder at or above 2000 0C or a method which utilizes a plasma to produce the graphite. Regarding the shape of the graphite, the form of a sheet such as carbon paper is the most suitable. As the graphite itself, a fibrous one is desirable because the surface area of an electrode can be rendered large, but a sheet like one obtained by molding powder may well be used. Especially as the graphite for the anode, one is recommended which is obtained in such a way that the graphite prepared by removing the intercalary material of an interlayer compound once formed is molded into the shape of a sheet by press work or the like. The anode and the cathode may well be constructed of only the graphite, or the graphite may well be supported by a supporting member such as nickel plate. b Electrolyte In an electrolyte, Li is desirable as an example of the cation of an electrolytic substance, but the ion of an alkali metal such as Na , K , Rb or Cst Or and also a quaternary ammonium ion such as CH3 4N C2H5 4N , C3H7 4Nf or C4H9 4N can be used by way of example. Examples of anions are C104 , BF4 , AlCl4 AsF6 , PF6 , SCN , SbF6 , NbF6 and TaF6 . At least one sort of these electrolytic substances is dissolved in an organic solvent, and the resulting solution is used as the electrolyte. Well suitable as the organic solvent of the electrolyte is a substance which is inactive to the electrodes and other constituent materials, which dissolves the electrolytic substance to afford a high electric conductivity and which is not disintegrated even by charge and discharge.Propylene carbonate is the most suitable as the substance which satisfies such properties. Besides, it is possible to employ one solvent, or a mixed solvent consisting of at least two, selected from among tetrahydrofuran, butyrolactone, 1, 2 dimethoxyethane, dioxane, dichloroethane, 1, 2 dichloroethane, N, N dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl sulfite, ethylene carbonate, 1, 3dioxolane, nitromethane, formamide, 2 methyl tetrahydrofuran, sulfolan, etc. Since, in the secondary battery of the present invention, both the anode and the cathode are constructed of the graphite which forms the graphite interlayer compounds in the mode of charge, the precipitation of a metal does not occur on the electrodes. In a discharge experiment on the secondary battery of the present invention, it has been ascertained that an average load current in excess of 2 mA is attained.Brief Description of the Dravings Fig. 1 is a sectional view showing the structure of a unit cell which is an embodiment of the present invention Fig. 2 is a sectional view of a layer built cell Fig. 3 is a cyclic voltamgram in the case of employing graphite for an electrode Fig. 4 is a sectional view of an experimental cell and Fig. 5 is a characteristic diagram showing the relationships between the numbers of the charging and discharging cycles and the Coulomb efficiencies of batteries.Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments Fig. I shows an example of the structure of the secondary battery of the present invention. Numeral 1 designates an anode armor which is electrically connected with an anode 2, numeral 3 a cathode armor which is electrically connected with a cathode 4, numeral 5 a separator, and numeral 6 an insulator. While Fig. 1 illustrates the structure of a unit cell including the anode, cathode and separator, a layer built cell in which a plurality of unit cells are stacked can also be fabricated. Fig. 2 shows an example of the structure of the layer built cell. Numeral 7 indicates conductive base members, which separate the cells and which couple the anodes and the cathodes. The number of the stacked layers is arbitrary. The separator 5 contains an organic solvent and an electrolyte.By way of example, it is made of the unwoven fabric of polypropylene impregnated with a solution in which Lilo4 is dissolved in propylene carbonate. The electrolyte exists also within and around the electrodes.Example 1 Doping and undoping in the secondary battery of the present invention were ascertained by a method to be described below. Electrochemical behaviors were investigated by potential scanning at positive and negative potentials as to an example wherein an active electrode was graphite in the form of a sheet having Åa bulk density 3 of 0.97 g cm , the graphite sheet being obtained in such a way that graphite powder the lattice constant of which was found 0.335 nm by X ray diffraction and the primary particlediameter0f which evaluated from the half width of the peak thereof was 19.4 nm was pressed to a thickness of 220 jim a platinum plate was used as a counter electrode and an Ag Ag electrode was used as a reference electrode, and wherein an electrolyte used was a solution in which LiC104 was dissolved in propylene carbonate at a concentration of 1 mol lit. The potential scanning rate was 1 mV sec, and the result ingcyclicvoltamgram is shown in Fig. 3. At the negative potentials, current flowing in the minus direction corresponds to a case where the graphite is doped with Li to become an interlayer compound, while current flowing in the plus direction corresponds to a case where Li having formed the interlayer compound of the graphite is released from the graphite by undoping. The potential at which the doping starts is 2.2 V vs Ag Ag which is positive with respect to the potential at which Li is reduced into Li metal, and it has been electrochemically confirmed that the electrodeposition of Li does not take place on the graphite.The Coulomb efficiency is 51 . On the other hand, at the positive potentials, current flowing in the plus direction corresponds to a case where carbon is doped with C104 to become an interlayer compound, while current flowing in the minus direction corresponds to a case where C104 having formed the interlayer compound is released from the graphite by undoping. The doping starting potential is 1.1 V vsAg Ag , and it is negative with respect to the potential at which C104 is oxidized. The Coulomb efficiency is 77 . These indicate that Li and C104 are readily intercalated between the layers of the graphite doping and are readily released from the graphite undoping .Since the stable potential width of the electrolyte on the platinum electrode is as sufficiently great as 3.3 to 1.5 Y vs Ag Ag , the disintegration of the electrolyte is not involved.Example 2 A battery shown in Fig. 4 was assembled using an anode and a cathode each of which was made of graphite in the form of a sheet having a bulk density of 0.97 3 g cm3 and a diameter of 10 mm, the graphite sheet being obtained in such a way that graphite powder the lattice constant of which was found 0.335 nm by X ray diffraction and the primary particle diameter of which evaluated from the half width of the peak thereof was 19.4 nm was pressed to a thickness of 220 pm, and also using an electrolyte which was a solution wherein Lilo4 was dissolved in propylene carbonate at a concentration of 1 mol l.

The openrcircuit voltage after the charge was 3.7 V, and the ratio between the quantity of electricity during the charge and the quantity of electricity during the discharge, namely, the Coulomb efficiency was 90 at the initial stage.The Coulomb efficiency in the charge and discharge of the 290th cycle was 24 .Example 3 Using the same constxtuents as in Example 2 except the electrolyte, the battery shown in Fig. 4 was assembledUsed as the electrolyte was a solution in which C2H5 4NBF4 was dissolved in propylene carbonate at a concentration of 1 mol l.

Example 4 Likewise to Example 3, the battery shown in Fig. 4 was assembled using the same constituents as in Example 2 except the electrolyte. Used as the electrolyte was a solution in which LiBF4 was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran at a concentration of 1 mol l. As the charging and discharging conditions of the battery, the current density was 2 mA cm2, the charging period of time was 90 seconds, and the discharge was conducted down to 1 V. The relationship between the numbers of charging and discharging cycles and the Coulomb efficiency is indicated as a curve C in Fig. 5. The open circuit voltage of this battery after the charge was 3.5 V. The Coulomb efficiency at the initial stage of the charging and discharging cycles was 83 , and that of the 270th cycle was 58 .Example 5 The battery shown in Fig. 4 was assembled using a cathode which was made of carbon paper 10 mm in diameter, the lattice constant of which was found 0.337 nm by X ray diffraction and the primary particle diameter of which was 48.6 nm, and an anode which was made of graphite molded into the form of a sheet 10 mm in diameter, the graphite sheet being obtained in such a way that the graphite with an intercalary material removed from an interlayer compound once formed was pressed.The graphite used for the anode was found on the basis of X ray diffraction to have a lattice constant of 0.335 nm and a primary particle diameter of 19.4 nm. Used as an electrolyte was a solution in which LiBF4 was dissolved in propylene carbonate at a concentration of 1 mol The charging and discharging conditions of the battery were similar to those of Example 2. The relationship between the numbers of charging and discharging cycles and the Coulomb efficiency is indicated by a curve D in Fig. 5. The open circuit voltage of this battery after the charge was 3.7 V.The Coulomb efficiency at the initial stage of the charging and discharging cycles was 87 , and that of the 298th cycle was 40 . Comparatiye Example 1 The battery shown in Fig. 4 was assembled using a cathode made of lithium, an anode made of graphite which was found by X ray diffraction to have a lattice constant of 0,337 nm and a primary particle diameter of 19.4 nm, and an electrolyte made of a solution in which LiC104 was dissolved in propylene carbonate at a concentration of 1 mol l. With a current density of 0.1 mA cm2t the charge was conducted for 30 minutes, and the discharge was conducted until the battery voltage became 2 V.A curve E in Fig 5 shows the numbers of charging and discharging cycles and the Coulomb efficiency. The open circuit voltage of this battery after the charge was 3.5 V, Although the Coulomb efficiency of the charging and discharging cycles at the initial stage was 82 , that of the 60th cycle was 32 . The lowering of the Coulomb efficiency is attributed to the short circuit between the electrodes.Comparative Example 2 A battery shown in Fig. 4 was assembled using a cathode and an anode each being made of active carbon 2 specific surface area 850 m2 g which was pressed to a thickness of 360 jum to prepare a sheet having a 3 bulk density of 1.13 go cm and a diameter of 10 mm, and an electrolyte being a solution in which Liy104 was dissolved in propylene at a concentration of 1.0 mol l.

In assembling the battery, the graphite which is not in the state of the graphite interlayer compound can be assembled, so that the handling is easy. Moreover, high Coulomb efficiencies in charge and discharge are exhibited for a long period of time, and the battery lifetime is long.
