# Formation of etch resistant resists through preferential permeation.

## Abstract
A method is provided for creation of oxygen etch resistant polymeric films for use in the production of micron and submicron dimension patterns and fine lines. These etch resistant polymeric films find use in fabrication of complex structures such as those in electronic devices and magnetic thin film heads. The etch resistance is achieved by incorporation of a protective oxide forming metal into a polymeric material using preferential permeation of orga nometallic materials into the polymeric material.
