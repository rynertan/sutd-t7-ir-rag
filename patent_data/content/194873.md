## Description
This invention relates to a process, apparatus and system for forming a sterile connection sterile docking between two tubes. There are a number of medical and scientific procedures which require the sterile transfer of fluids from one container to another. An example of the need for sterile docking is in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis CAPD . The CAPD patient has a tube connected to his or her peritoneal cavity via an implanted catheter. A tube from a bag of fresh dialysis solution is connected to the patient s tube. The fresh dialysis solution is drained from the bag into the patient s peritoneal cavity where it remains for about 3 to 4 hours. After this treatment period, the spent dialysate is drained back into the empty bag which is then disconnected from the patient s tube. A bag of fresh dialysis solution is then connected to the patient s tube and the procedure is repeated. Sterile connections during CAPD procedures would minimize the occurrence of peritonitis. The process, apparatus and system of this invention can be employed with various medical devices including catheters, urinary drainage bags, treatment bags such as those used in IV therapies for administering antibiotic, bacteriostat, or other medication, as well as for sterile connections involving blood bags. At present, blood from a donor is drawn into a primary bag which can be joined to one or two satellite bags, all connected and sterilized before use. These satellite bags can be used for holding blood separated components, such as plasma or platelets treating agents, such as bases, buffers, stabilizers for cell metabolism, other preservatives, or rejuvenants or washes to remove a treating agent or other contaminant. The process, apparatus and system of this invention permits blood processing without compromising sterility, limiting storage life, or requiring the preconnection of a multitude of bags, all wet sterilizable, without knowing which, if any, will be used. U.S. Patent 4,369,779 Spencer discloses a process, apparatus and system for sterilely connecting two sterile, closed end tubes. The process comprises urging a hot cutting means through each tube and simultaneously forming a continuous molten seal between a heated cutting surface and a transverse section of each said tube thereby maintaining a seal between the interior and exterior of the tubes, aligning the tubes with each other and joining the respective molten ends of the tubes together to form a joint between the tubes, both while maintaining said seal. The apparatus comprises a cutting means, means adapted to heat said cutting means, a pair of mounting blocks adapted to receive and hold two tubes to be joined, means to provide movement between said blocks and said cutting means to a position such that the cutting means is between said blocks and traversing where the blocks are adapted to receive tubes, means adapted to realign said blocks to a position where two different tube ends are aligned with and facing each other, and means to separate said blocks and the cutting means while urging the blocks together. The patent teaches that during the connection operation there should be no significant visible deformation of the tubes and that, in order to obtain a secure dock, the tubes to be joined must not contain more liquid than a thin film on the walls at or near the locations where they are to be cut and joined. European Patent Publication No. 0 134 630, discloses a process, apparatus, and system for the sterile connection of closed end tubes flat tube welding . The process comprises flattening a section of each tube to urge inside walls of each tube into contact, urging a hot cutting means through the flattened section of each tube thereby temporarily sealing together the inside walls of each tube and providing molten tube ends, aligning the tubes to be connected with each other, joining the desired molten ends of said tubes together to form a joint between said tubes, and cooling said joint and then subjecting it to stress to open the temporary seal in each tube, thereby providing fluid communication between the joined tubes. This invention concerns a process for joining thermoplastic tubes together transversely of the axis of each tube comprising This invention also concerns an apparatus for forming a sterile connection between thermoplastic tubes comprising a cutting means capable of cold cutting, a pair of mounting blocks adapted to receive, hold and flatten the tubes to be joined, means to provide movement between said blocks and said cutting means to a position such that the cutting means is between said blocks and traversing where the blocks are adapted to receive said tubes, means adapted to realign said blocks to a position where two different tube ends are aligned with and facing each other for each pair of tubes to be joined, means to separate the cutting means from the tubes that have been cut, means for heating the cut ends of the tubes without contacting the ends, and means for urging together the tubes to be joined. This invention also concerns a process for providing a sterile connection for urinary drainage in which a first drainage container connected to a drainage tube extending from a catheter implanted in a patient s urethra is connected to a second drainage container having a connector free tube specifically for sterile connection and with a sealed distal end, both containers being disposable wherein a pair of mounting blocks is adapted to receive, hold and flatten the drainage tube and the connector free tube, cold cutting means cuts through the flattened section of each tube, the blocks and said cutting means are moved to a position such that the cutting means is between said blocks and traversing where the blocks are adapted to receive said tubes, the blocks are realigned to a position where the resulting different tube ends to be joined are separated and aligned with and facing each other, the cutting means is separated from the tubes that have been cut, the cut ends of the tubes are heated without contact with the heating means, and the tubes to be joined are urged together. This invention also concerns a process for providing a connector system for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis wherein a catheter is surgically implanted in a patient s peritoneal cavity and wherein This invention also concerns an improved catheter for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, the improvement comprising a thermoplastic tube sterilely attached to the catheter at one end of said tube by the process of this invention, the other end of said tube being sealed by fusion of its material. This invention also concerns an administration set for a catheter for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis comprising a thermoplastic tube having one end adapted for connection to a catheter by the process of this invention, said thermoplastic tube being sterilely sealed at its distal end by fusion of its material or, optionally, having a spike at its distal end. It is preferred that the sterile seal be made by thermal fusion. This invention is characterized in that the cutting means cuts cold and is extensively reusable. The heating means does not contact the thermoplastic tubing, does not pick up any of the material from which the tubing is made and is, likewise, extensively reusable.

Figure 7 is an isometric view of the cam used to move the mounting blocks and the cutting means of a sterile connection device of Figure 6. Figure 8 is a view of Figure 7 taken along line 8 8. The tubing employed in the process of this invention is preferably a thermoplastic resin which melts at least 30 C below the temperature at which it begins to degrade in the time exposed to heat in the process of the present invention. The tubes to be connected are preferably of the same diameter but can have different diameters so long as a complete seal having about 50 of the original tube strength can be made. The tubes to be joined can be made of the same material or can be made of compatible resins. Compatible resins as used herein means that at the operating temperature both form thick, viscous melts which will flow together to form a single melt phase without polymer degradation or formation of thermal or other chemical reaction products which would weaken or otherwise interfere with formation of the single melt phase and its subsequent cooling and solidification to a strong joint. For example, polyethylene is compatible with polyethylene copolymers and polypropylene. Candidate materials include polyvinyl chloride, polyurethanes, nylon, polyester thermoplastics such as polyethylene terephthalate, and polyolefins. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the tubes to be joined are flattened in an appropriate section so that the inside walls meet. Then the tubes are sequentially or simultaneously cut. Cutting can be effected by any typical cutting implement such as wire, blade, knife, scissors and the like. The tubes will be cut cold meaning that they will not be heat deformed in any substantial way by the action of the cutting means. The cutting means will not be heated to a bacteria kill temperature and, consequently, the tubes will not be sterilely cut as in Spencer, U.S. 4,369,779. The tubes ends are moved into alignment after cutting and they are melted, sterilized, and subsequently pushed together to form a joint. The joint is briefly cooled and then can be subjected to slight transverse stress if needed to open the temporary seal in each tube. The joint is sound and strong and a number of additional joints can be made in subsequent sterile connections with the same tube. Furthermore, each subsequent connection can be made at exactly the same point on the tube. The process can be used to make more than one joint at a time by using multiple more than two tubes and multiple tube slots. The heating means employed, after cold cutting, is positioned near the tube ends, for a period of time sufficient to raise the temperature of the cut tube ends high enough to effect sterilization and melting, e.g., about 260 C for one half second or more. That temperature must be maintained at the ends and as far along the tube internally as may have been compromised by contamination. In the apparatus of this invention, the tubes are usually clamped flat at a point beginning about 0.25 to 0.50 cm from the cut end. Thus, the hot wire, fluid jet or other means used to effect the heating should be adapted to transmit heat for a distance of about 0.50 cm within the time temperature parameters already described. The time between the cold cut and heat sterilization will depend on the environment. It is preferred that heat sterilization be initiated within about 1 or 2 seconds after the cold cut. Sterilizing means can be any hot surface, solid or liquid, which will radiate heat to the tube, or it can be a jet of hot fluid which heats the tube by conduction. A fluid jet stream of hot air, nitrogen, or the like, would be directed across the ends of the tubes so the hot gas is in contact with the ends. A hot wire or ribbon is preferred because it can be heated quickly as needed with very little electrical energy and easily positioned and controlled. A typical wire would have a diameter of about 2 mms, be heated to a visible red heat of about 400 to 650 C and held about 0.10 to 0.25 mm from the tube ends for about 3 seconds. Depending upon the wire s distance from the tube ends and its temperature, the time to effect sterility may vary above or below 3 seconds, i.e., about 2 to 15 seconds. The tubes to be connected in the process of the invention have closed ends in the sense that the tubes are connected to containers such as a blood bag or dialysis bag, to a catheter implanted in a patient, or to some other medical instrumentation closed to the external environment. The present process will work with opened end tubes but, in that use, will of course, not provide the advantage of sterility or isolation from the environment. Referring now to Figure 1, the sealed end Referring now to Figure 2, the cold cutting means Referring now to Figure 3, block Referring now to Figure 4, ends Referring now to Figure 5, mounting blocks Inside surfaces of covers Referring to Figure 6, the sterile connection device is denoted generally as Figure 7 depicts the mechanism for generating the five orthogonal motions required for splicing. More particularly, the mechanism comprises three cams to accomplish the five motions. In the preferred embodiment shown, the cams are grooves The sterile connection operation with the apparatus disclosed utilizes five orthogonal motions involving mounting block As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, melting the tube ends can be effected after the cutting means is withdrawn up to and during the time the cut ends are being urged together. When the heating means is a hot wire or ribbon, it is preferred that said means be position directly between the severed ends of the tubes to be joined. In this embodiment, the heating means must be removed before the severed tube ends are brought together. Of course, when the heating means is located so as not to interfere with the joining of the tubes, there is no need to remove same during the joining of the tubes. Fluid jets suitable for use in the present invention are known. Suitable jets are described in Figure 8 depicts cam cylinder In the most preferred embodiment of this invention, the stub ends of the tubes are sealed fluid tight to effect substantially total containment. In this embodiment, prior to being flattened with the mounting blocks, the two tubes are flattened with a clamp in the space between the mounting blocks. All fluid is displaced from the portion of the tubes involved in the sterile connection operation. Employment of a clamp is also useful in situations where the tubing is very stiff. Alternatively, the mounting blocks can be spaced apart a distance which maintains the tubing flat in this section thereby preventing the trapping of liquid. For instance, with tubes of about 5¬Ω mm outside diameter, the spacing between the blocks should be about 0.4 mm to 1 mm, preferably about 0.8 mm. In either mode of operation, the cutting means can be withdrawn prior to alignment of the tubes. The tubes can then be aligned, sterilized melted, and joined to give a sterile joint. In a total containment mode, the freshly molten tube ends which are not connected to make a joint emerge with temporary seals which can be made permanent by use of a Hematron device. Referring to Figure 3, one can see that after the ends of tubes In the description of this invention, the term seal has been employed to mean the closure of a tube end connection means the welded joint which holds two tubes together and temporary means that a seal can be opened with light force, i.e., 1 or 2 lbs if the operator so desires but otherwise the seal remains shut. A temporary seal may have pinholes. Fluid tight temporary seal means a closure which does not have pinholes and does not permit ingress or egress of fluid. Stub ends are the tube ends which are not to be joined. Between a spacing of about 1 mm and 2 mm, preferably about 1¬Ω mm, temporary seals which have no pin holes can be obtained after the heating means is withdrawn. However, some egress of fluid may occur prior to withdrawal. As used herein, transverse means across the axis of each tube but not necessarily at a right angle with said axis. The tubes can be flattened in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal plane however, a diagonal plane is preferred for convenience when employing a controller operated cam cylinder unit. The apparatus of the invention can form part of a sterile connection system for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis in which a dialysis solution container with a transfer port that includes a segment of tubing is coupled to a tube extending from an implanted catheter opening into a patient s peritoneal cavity. In this embodiment, the patient s tube and or the transfer tube can have an entry port with a protective cover or a sealed distal end but preferably both have a sealed distal end. This system minimizes the possibility of peritonitis and permits any other treatment bag, such as a bag of antibiotic, bacteriostat, or other medication to be connected as desired. Moreover, this embodiment offers the additional advantage of eliminating the need for the patient to carry the empty dialysis solution bag because the bag can be sterilely disconnected by using the apparatus of the invention to heat seal both the patient tube and the bag tube. In this mode, a second tube is not placed in the tube slots. The freshly separated tubes are allowed to cool and then, if desired, are permanently sealed by use of a Hematron device. In the process of the invention, occlusion of the interior of the joined tubes is eliminated and subsequent connections can be made at the same place on a tube. The latter feature provides another aspect of the invention. The CAPD patient has a surgically implanted catheter such as a silastic catheter having an external titanium connector to which a polyvinyl chloride tube having a spike administration set is attached. It is necessary to replace the polyvinyl chloride tube about once per month. This replacement provides a source of potential infection of the peritoneum. In another embodiment, the apparatus of the invention forms part of a sterile connection system for connecting two blood bags. One of the bags can be a donor bag and the other a transfer bag. The donor bag will have a blood collection tube and optionally can have a transfer port with a transfer tube. The transfer bag has a transfer tube connection tube . The two bags can be sterilely connected by joining the connection tube of the transfer bag to the transfer port of the donor bag. The transfer port of the donor bag can be a conventional entry port having a protective covering and a septum inside the port. The bags can also be connected by joining the blood collection tube of the donor bag to the connection tube of the transfer bag. In the preferred embodiment for both the blood bag system and the CAPD system, the donor bag and dialysis bag have, specifically for sterile connection, an additional tube pigtail which is connector free and has a sealed distal end. The term connector free as used herein means the tube does not bear any of the conventional fittings, such as a plastic fitting with a diaphragm, a low melting thermoplastic insert, an insert fusable by radiant energy, or the like. The tube has a sealed distal end which is prepared solely by sealing the tube end together by use of heat, solvent or the like. In the present system for the sterile connection of blood bags, the need to pre assemble bags into a system is eliminated. It is to be understood that the expression blood bag as used herein refers collectively to either the donor primary bag or the satellite bag. With the present invention, satellite bags can be sterilely connected to a donor bag as the need arises. The apparatus and process of the invention are also useful in other peritoneal dialysis therapies, such as intermittent peritoneal dialysis IPD , continuous cycled peritoneal dialysis CCPD , and other therapies using the peritoneal membrane, can beneficially be employed in urinary drainage, and can be used in the manufacture of sterile medical supplies and in other sterile packaging processes. IPD is a machine automated peritoneal dialysis wherein dialysate is prepared from a concentrate and then delivered to a patient with machine control of inflow and dwell time over a predetermined period of time. CCPD is a machine automated peritoneal dialysis wherein exchanges of peritoneal fluid are performed automatically at night and the abdomen is left full during the daytime. In conventional urinary drainage, an in dwelling urinary catheter is placed in the bladder urethra to relieve temporarily anatomic or physiologic urinary obstruction, to facilitate urological surgery, or to permit accurate measurement of urinary output in severely ill patients. The catheter is connected to a drain tube which is connected, in turn, to a urinary drainage bag which is typically accessed three times per day for drainage. Urinary tract infection is a major risk associated with present urinary drainage procedures, and a strong need for sterile access exists. The device and apparatus of the present invention fulfill that need. The apparatus of the invention when used with suitable disposables can be used for sterile access for bag removal or replacement and for irrigation. The drainage system for this use consists of a Foley catheter connected to a drain tube which is connected to a low cost disposable drainage bag, additional disposable drainage bags having a connector free tube specifically for sterile connection and with a sealed distal end irrigation bags and syringes similarly having a connector free tube with a sealed distal end and a sterile connection device. Instead of draining the bag three times per day, the used drainage bag can be sterilely disconnected and a new bag sterilely connected thrice daily. For this embodiment, the apparatus of the invention can be employed in the total containment mode. One example of other sterile packaging processes where the apparatus of the invention can be beneficially employed is in the packaging of sterile milk and fruit juices. In the current commercial production, the contents and package are sterilized separately, then combined in a sterile packaging system. The package includes a drinking straw. Difficulties have been encountered by the consumer in opening the packages and using the drinking straw incorporated therewith. With the apparatus of the invention the container can be a polyethylene bag with an access port tube as the drinking straw. During the packaging operation, the straw can be sterilely and temporarily sealed with the apparatus of the invention. The package can be opened for drinking by application of finger pressure to force open the sterile, temporary seal. The invention is further illustrated by the following Example in which all percentages are by volume unless otherwise stated. The apparatus used can be a device as depicted in Figure 5 wherein one mounting block is stationary while the other is pivotably moveable in two orthogonal directions. A cutting means, 0.50 inch 1.27 cm high and 1.35 inch 3.43 cm long and 0.012 inch 0.03 cm thick, can be pivotably held below the tube slots with the 0.012 inch 0.03 cm dimension centered in the 0.2 inch 0.51 cm gap between the mounting blocks. The blade can be rigidly supported on each end. For each joint made, two sections of plasticized polyvinyl chloride tubing with 5.5 mm outside diameter and 0.81 mm thick walls are pressed into the slots. The mounting blocks are closed, thereby flattening each tube in the area of the jaws. The cutting blade is positioned and moved to cut through both flattened tubes simultaneously. The moveable block is then pivotably shifted about 2¬Ω mms to separate the cut tube ends and shifted about 7¬Ω mms to align tube ends to be joined. The blade is then pivotably withdrawn at the same time as a hot wire is positioned near the cut ends. The hot wire is maintained at a temperature of about 500 C for a period of time sufficient to heat the cut ends and inside tube surfaces back to the clamps to a temperature of about 260 C for a half second or so. The moveable block is then pivotably shifted toward the fixed holder to squeeze together the molten tube ends to be joined. The joined tube ends are allowed to cool for several seconds before they are removed from the holders. The flat tube joint then can be popped by manually squeezing the joint between one s fingers. The joined tubes have about 70 of their original strength when pulled in tension and do not leak. Approximately 50 mls of sterile nutrient medium is added to blood bags in a laminar flow laboratory hood with other precautions being taken against bacterial contamination. The nutrient medium contains per liter 17 g of tripticase peptone a pancreatic digest of casein , 3 g of phytone peptone a digest of soybean meal , 5 g of sodium chloride, 2.5 g of dipotassium phosphate and 2.5 g of dextrose. The bags are incubated at 35 C and after 48 hours the nutrient medium is checked for sterility. There is no evidence of contamination. To guarantee that the sterility test is applied to the inside of the tube, the bags are hung upside down during the incubation period so that the broth is in the tube where the joint is to be made. The outside surface of the blood collection bag tubing is coated with an albumin solution to make the tube sticky and coated with bacteria by immersing the sealed ends of the tubes to a depth of about 4 to 6 inches in a dense bacterial spore suspension 1,8 x 10‚Å∑ per ml of The
