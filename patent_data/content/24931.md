The compounds of formula VIIIEMI26.1 which are useful intermediates in the preparation of compounds of formula I, are novel compounds. Therefore, in a further embodiment the invention provides compounds of formula VIII wherein A, B, D, E, k, 1, m, R1, U, V and Q are as hereinbefore defined. The compounds of formula I are active as herbicides and therefore, in a further aspect the invention provides a process for severely damaging or killing unwanted plants which process comprises applying to the plants, or to the growth medium of the plants, an effective amount of a compound of formula I as herein before defined. Generally speaking the compounds of formula I are herbicidally effective against a variety of plants.However, certain of the compounds of the invention are selectively active against monocotyledonous plants, dicotyledonous plants being relatively unaffected by rates of application of the compounds of the invention which are severely damaging or lethal to other plant species . Moreover, certain of the compounds of formula I are selectively active within the group of monocotyledonous plants and may be used at a rate sufficient to kill or severely damage monocotyledonous weeds in a monocotyledonous cereal crop. Therefore, in yet a further aspect the invention provides a process for selectively controlling the growth of weeds in crops which process comprises applying to the crop, or to the growth medium of the crop, a compound of formula I, as hereinbefore defined, in an amount sufficient to severely damage or kill the weeds but insufficient to damage the crop substantially. The compounds of formula I may be applied directly to the plant post emergence application or to the soil before the emergence of the plant pre emergence application . However, the compounds are, in general, more effective when applied to the plant post emergence. The compounds of formula I may be used on their own to inhibit the growth of, severely damage, or kill plants but are preferably used in the form of a composition comprising a compound of the invention in admixture with a carrier comprising a solid or liquid diluent. Therefore, in yet a further aspect the invention provides plant growth inhibiting, plant damaging, or plant killing compositions comprising a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined and an inert carrier therefor. Compositions according to the invention include both dilute compositions, which are ready for immediate use, and concentrated compositions, which require to be diluted before use, usually with water. Preferably the compositions contain from 0.01 to 90 by weight of the active ingredient. Dilute compositions ready for use preferably contain from 0.01 to 2 of active ingredient, while concentrated compositions may contain from 20 to 90 of active ingredient, although from 20 to 70 is usually preferred. The solid compositions may be in the form of granules, or dusting powders wherein the active ingredient is mixed with a finely divided solid diluent, eg kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, dolomite, calcium carbonate, talc, powdered magnesia, Fuller s earth and gypsum. They may also be in the form of dispersible powders or grains, comprising a wetting agent to facilitate the dispersion of the powder or grains in liquid.Solid compositions in the form of a powder may be applied as foliar dusts. Liquid compositions may comprise a solution or dispersion of an active ingredient in water optionally containing a surface active agent, or may comprise a solution or dispersion of an active ingredient in a water immiscible organic solvent which is dispersed as droplets in water. Surface active agents may be of the cationic, anionic, or non ionic type. The cationic agents are, for example, quaternary ammonium compounds eg cetyltrimethylammonium bromide . Suitable anionic agents are soaps salts of aliphatic mono esters of sulphuric acid, for example sodium lauryl sulphate and salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds, for example sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, sodium, calcium, and ammonium lignosulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate, and a mixture of the sodium salts of diisopropyl and triisopropylnaphthalenesulphonic acid. Suitable nonionic agents are the condensation products of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols such as oleyl alcohol and cetyl alcohol, or with alkylphenols such as octyl or nonyl phenol or octyl cresol.Other non ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monolaurate the condensation products of the partial esters with ehtylene oxide and the lecithins. The aqueous solutions or dispersions may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in water or an organic solvent optionally containing wetting or dispersing agent s and then, when organic solvents are used, adding the mixture so obtained to water optionally containing wetting or dispersing agent s . Suitable organic solvents include, for example, ethylene dichloride, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, diacetone alcohol, toluene, kerosene, methylnaphthalene, the xylenes and trichloroethylene. The compositions for use in the form of aqueous solutions or dispersions are generally supplied in the form of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient, and the concentrate is then diluted with water before use. The concentrates are usually required to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such storage, to be capable of dilution with water to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. Concentrates conveniently contain 20 90 , preferably 2070 , by weight of the active ingredient s . Dilute preparations ready for use may contain varying amounts of the active ingredient s depending upon the intended purpose amounts of 0.01 to 10.0 and preferably 0.1 to 2 , by weight of active ingredient s are normally used. A preferred form of concentrated composition comprises the active ingredient which has been finely divided and which has been dispersed in water in the presence of a surface active agent and a suspending agent. Suitable suspending agents are hydrophilic colloids and include, for example, polyvinylpyrrolidone and sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and the vegetable gums, for example gum acacia and gum tragacanth. Preferred suspending agents are those which impart thixotropic properties to, and increase the viscosity of the concentrate. Examples of preferred suspending agents include hydrated colloidal mineral silicates, such as montmorillonite, beidellite, nontronite, hectorite, saponite, and saucorite. Bentonite is especially preferred. Other suspending agents include cellulose derivatives and polyvinyl alcohol. The rate of application of the compounds of the invention will depend on a number of factors including, for example, the compound chosen for usei the identity of the plants whose growth is to be inhibited the formulations selected for use and whether the compound is to be applied for foliage or root uptake. As a general guide, however, an application rate of from 0.005 to 20 kilograms per hectare is suitable while from 0.01 to 5 kilograms per hectare may be preferred. The compositions of the invention may comprise, in addition to one or more compounds of the invention, one or more compounds not of the invention but which possess biological activity. For example, as hereinbe fore indicated the compounds of the invention are in general substantially more effective against monocotyledonous plants or grass species than against dicotyledonous plants or broad leaved species. As a result, in certain applications the herbicidal use of the compounds of the invention alone may be sufficient to protect a crop. Accordingly in yet a still further embodiment the invention provides a herbicidal composition comprising a mixutre of at least one herbicidal compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined with at least one other herbicide. The other herbicide may be any herbicide not having the formula I. It will generally be a herbicide having a complementary action.

The emulsifiable concentrates and suspensions were then diluted with water to give an aqueous composition of the required con centration suitable for use in the evaluation of the pre emergence and post emergence herbicidal activity of the compounds of the invention. Example 26 The pre emergent herbicidal activity of the compounds of the invention formulated as described inExample 25 was assessed by the following procedure. The seeds of the test species were sown in rows 2 cm deep in soil contained in seed boxes. The e mono cotyledonous plants and the dicotyledonous plants were sown in separate boxes and after sowing the two boxes where sprayed with the required quantity of a composition of the invention. Two duplicate seed boxes were prepared in the same manner but were not sprayed with a composition of the invention and were used for comparison purposes. All the boxes were placed in a glasshouse, lightly watered with an overhead spray to initiate germination and then sub irrigated as required for optimum plant growth.After three weeks the boxes were removed from the glasshouse and the effect of the treatment was visually assessed, The results are presented in Table 6 where the damage to plants is rated on a scale of from 0 to 3 where 0 represents from 0 to 25 damage, 3 represents 75 to 99 kill and 3 represents 100 kill.

of a solution containing 21.8 g per litre of Span 80 and 78.2 g per litre of Tween 20 in methylcyclohexanone to 500 ml with water. Span 80 is a Trade Mark for a surface active agent comprising sorbitan monolaurate. Tween 20 is a TradeMark for a surface active agent comprising a condensate of sorbitan monolaurate with 20 molar proportions of ethylene oxide.Each 5 ml emulsion containing a test compound was then diluted to 40 ml with water and sprayed on to young pot plants post emergence test of the species named in Table 8 below Damage to test plants was assessed after 14 days on a scale of 0 to 5 where 0 is 0 to 20 damage and 5 is complete kill.In a test for pre emergence herbicidal acitivity, seeds of the test plants were sown in a shallow slit formed in the surface of soil in fibre trays. The surface was then levelled and sprayed, and fresh soil then spread thiniy over the sprayed surface. Assessment of herbicidal damage was carried out after 21 days using the same scale of 0 to 5 as the post emergence test. In both cases the degree of herbicidal damage was assessed by comparison with untreated control plants. The results are given in Table 8 below. A dash means that no experiment was carried out.

the field. The test compound was formulated following essentially the same procedure described in Example 28. The seeds of the test plant species were sown using a Stanhay Precision Seeder on flat topped hills spaced 1 metre apart. Two species were sown on each hill. The flat topped hills were grouped in sub plots on the basis of the rate of application of the test chemical. The species were sown at different times so that they would all reach approximately the same stage of growth at the same time. Each flat topped hill to be sprayed with the formulated test compound was pegged to a 1.25 metre centre and sprayed to a width of 1 metre using anOxford Precision Sprayer fitted with two No O T jets. In the pre emergence test the flat topped hills were sprayed with the test compound after sowing and the damage to the test plants was visually assessed 14, 21, 35 and 63 days after spraying. The results, expressed as percentage kill, are given in Table 9Part A. In the post emergence test the flat topped hills were sprayed with the test compound after the test plants had reached the 2 3 leaf stage and the damage was visually assessed 7, 14, 28 and 56 days after spraying.The results, expressed as percentage kill, are given inTable 9 Part B.
