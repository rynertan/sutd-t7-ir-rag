# Method of producing elongate large size forged article.

## Abstract
A metod of producing forged article by casting a molten alloy steel containing 0.02 to 0.15wt of niobium and 9 to 12wt of chromium in a metal mold to form an ingot and subjecting the ingot to a forging. The ingot is formed to have a diameter greater than the height thereby to prevent generation of eutectic NbC and sedimental crystals.
