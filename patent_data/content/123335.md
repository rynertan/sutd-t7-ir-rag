# High speed drive circuit.

## Abstract
A driver circuit directly couples the clock signal to gate electrodes of pull up devices 32, 33 to minimize the loading effect on the clock signal. The pull up devices 32, 33 pull up the output node 34 to substantially the positive power sup ply voltage V . The clock signal is coupled to the gate elec trodes of the pull up devices 32, 33 by a transistor 30 whose gate electrode is controlled by a control signal. The control signal also triggers a pull down device 39 coupled to the gate electrodes of the pull up devices 32, 33 when it is not desired to couple the clock signal to the gate electrodes of the pull up devices 32, 33 .
