# Process for the conversion of an alkane to a mixture of an alcohol and a ketone.

## Abstract
A mixture of the alcohol and ketone derivatives of alkanes is produced by reacting the alkane with a hydrocar byl hydroperoxide, eg t butyl hydroperoxide, at ambient or elevated temperature and pressure in the presence as catalyst of an iron or manganese square planar complex having heterocyclic nitrogen donor ligands, eg a porphyrin or phthalocyanine complex, which complex has either no axial ligands, eg the lower valency or cationic complex, or an axial ligand which is non coordinating or weakly coordinating.
