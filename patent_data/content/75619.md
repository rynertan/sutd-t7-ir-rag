# Self righting traffic marker.

## Abstract
A portable self righting traffic marker comprises a generally rigid body 1 having a base 2 on which the marker can rock and includes an outwardly flaring region 4 merging with an integral upper part 3 . The base is so weighted that in use the marker returns to its upright position by itself when it is knocked over.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A portable self righting traffic marker which is characterized by a generally rigid body 1 having a base 2 on which the marker can rock and including an outwardly flaring region 4 merging with an integral upper part 3 , said base being so weighted or adapted to be so weighted in use that the marker returns to its upright position by itself when it is knocked over. 2. A marker as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the upper part 3 is hollow at least in part, and has an open top 8 so that a plurality of markers can be stacked together. 3. A marker as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the sides of the upper part 3 are provided with apertures 9 or 10 to permit the wind resistance of the upper part to be lowered and or to allow rainwater collected within the upper part to drain out of the upper part. 4. A marker as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the upper part 3 is of closed form. 5. A marker as claimed in any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the base is weighted with poured concrete or other coherent heavy material 2a . 6. A marker as claimed in any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the base 2 is formed with a separate compartment having a closable aperture 2b via which material to weight the base can be introduced into the base. 7. A marker as claimed in claim 6, as dependant on claim 2, characterized in that the aperture 2b is provided in a wall partitioning the base 2 from the hollow upper part 3 . 8. A marker as claimed in any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the bottom of the base 2 is provided with a flat portion 5 to facilitate standing the marker on the ground in the upright position. 9. A marker as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the bottom of the base 2 is provided with a recess 6 the peripheral edge of which provides a land 7 for facilitating standing the marker on the ground. 10. A marker as claimed in any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the base 2 is generally of partsperical shape to enable the marker to rock thereon.

## Description
SELF RIGHTING TRAFFIC MARKER The present invention relates to traffic markers and, more particularly, to self righting traffic markers which return to their normal erect position after being knocked over. One kind of portable marker or road sign currently in use is the coloured, e.g. red and white, traffic cone. However, this cone has a number of disadvantages. For example, it is easily toppled over by passing vehicles it can be blown away by the wind, the upper part of the cone becomes increasingly narrow so as to become less clearly visible and therefore less efficient as a warning sign and the warning display area is small in proportion to the road space occupied by its base. An object of the present invention is to provide a simple but efficient portable traffic marker which reduces or eliminates at least some of the disadvantages associated with the traffic cone. The present invention consists in a portable self righting traffic marker comprising a generally rigid body having a base on which the marker can rock and including an outwardly flaring region merging with an integral upper part, said base being so weighted or adapted to be so weighted in use that the marker returns to its upright position by itself when it is knocked over. Conveniently, the upper part of the marker is hollow, at least in part, and has an open top so that a plurality of markers can be stacked together. Further, the sides of the upper part of the marker may be provided with apertures to lower the wind resistance of the upper part and or to allow rainwater collected withinthe upper part to drain out of the upper part. In order that the invention may be more readily understood, as well as the objects and advantages thereof, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of one embodiment of traffic marker according to the invention, and Figure 2 is a perspective view of a further embodiment. Referring to Figure 1, a portable self righting traffic marker comprises a body 1 of a light material, for example a plastics material such as polyvinylchloride or polyethylene, having a weighted base 2 and a comparatively lighter generally pyramid shaped upper part 3. The outer surface 4 of the base 2 of the body may be sloped, curved, generally part spherical, e.g. semi spherical, or otherwise shaped so that the marker can rock thereon, and the bottom of the base is provided with a flat portion 5 which facilitates standing the marker on the ground in the upright position. The base may be weighted in any convenient manner e.g. by pouring concrete or another heavy coherent material into the base, as represented by the shading 2a. Alternatively, the base may comprise a separate compartment having a closable aperture 2b for example in the side of the base, via which sand, soil, water or other heavy material can be introduced into the base. In use, when the marker is knocked over the weight and shape of the base allow the marker to rock on the base and return to its upright position as shown in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows a second embodiment of traffic marker comprising a body 1 which may be made of a similar material as the embodiment described above, and which has a weighted base 2 and a comparatively lighter upper part 3. Again the outer surface 4 of the base 2 may be sloped, curved, generally partspherical, e.g. semi spherical, or otherwise shaped so that the marker can rock thereon. The bottom of the base includes a recess 6, the peripheral edge of which provides a land 7 which facilitates standing the marker on the ground in the upright position. The upper part 3 is generally rectangular in shape and increases in its lateral dimensions from the top of the base to the top of the upper part. Two of the opposing sides or walls of the upper part are slightly taller than the remaining two sides. The upper part 3 is hollow and has an open top 8.The sides of the upper part 3 may be provided with apertures or perforations 9 which lower the wind resistance of the upper part.In addition, apertures 10 serving as rain vents may be provided in the sides of the upper part a short distance above the base through which rain water which has collected within the upper part can drain. In this embodiment, the upper part is so designed that a plurality of markers can be stacked together, i.e. with the lower part of each marker being insertable into the upper part of the adjacent marker via the open top 8. The base may be weighted in a similar manner to the base of the embodiment described above. Further in this embodiment, where a separate base compartment is provided, the closable aperture 2b may be in the wall partitioning the base from the hollow upper part. Again, when the marker is toppled over it returns to its upright position by virtue of the weight and shape of the base on which the marker can rock. It will be appreciated that either embodiment of marker shown in the Figures may be of another shape, for example, the upper part and or the opening in the top of the upper part may be square, round, triangular, hexagonal or of other polygonal shape in plan view. The marker may also carry information or the like for road users or pedestrians. For example, the markers may bear warning stripes and or indicate speed limits. Alternatively, or in addition, the markers may be provided with reflectors, cats eyes, or warning lights.
