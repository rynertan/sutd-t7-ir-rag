# Process for the manufacture of polyureas containing urethane groups and the products so obtained.

## Abstract
Novel polymers of excellent resistance to heat and to flames are obtained by reacting together an aqueous solu tion of an aminoplast precondensate such as a urea formaldehyde syrup, an organic polyisocyanate comprising di isocyanatophenyl methane or a mixture of di isocya natophenyl methane with poly isocyanatophenyl polymeth ylenes, and an isocyanate,reactive organic polyol in the presence of a tertiary amine as catalyst and a poly ha loalkyl phosphate, especially tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate. Under normal circumstances, foamed materials are obtained, but non foamed materials can be produced by carrying out the reaction in the presence of a COâ‚‚ absorbent such as lime.
