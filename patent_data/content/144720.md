# Brazing apparatus.

## Abstract
Brazing apparatus for repairing printed circuit lines or attaching electrical components, comprising a pair of brazing electrodes forming an electrode assembly 10 and a holder 11 therefor in which the electrode assembly 10 can be repetitively extended to compensate for wear without neces sity of removal and machining heretofore required. The holder 11 is a part of the circuit delivering electrical power to the electrodes and makes contact with the electrodes close to the working tip 26, 27 to maintain uniform circuit resistance and permit repairs of consistent quality.
