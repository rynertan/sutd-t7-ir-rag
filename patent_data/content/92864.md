# IMPROVEMENTS IN HEAT PUMP SYSTEMS FOR HOT WATER PRODUCTION

## Abstract
The hot water production system, in particular for domestic use, comprises a water container connected to a cold water inlet 3 and hot water outlet 5 a water circuit connected to the container in which a circulation pump is disposed and a heat pump, the condenser of which is in heat transfer relationship with said water circuit. In the water circuit 4 there is disposed a heat exchanger 7 heated by the condenser 8 . Temperature control means TA are provided, which control the circulation pump 6 and heat pump 9 . A temperature controlled valve 14 controls the amount of water flowing from the water circuit to the container 1 .
