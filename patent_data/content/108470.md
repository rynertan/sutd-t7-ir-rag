# Apparatus and method for inspecting a component.

## Abstract
A component 12 for dimensional inspection is rotated against a contrasting background while being scanned by an optical scanner 14 comprising a straight line array of sensors 18 . The scanner resolution is sufficiently high to ensure that its output defines a linear dimension of the component 12 which contrasts strongly with its back ground. By rotating the scanner 14 or the component 12 a series of straight line scans is obtained. Given a recorded scan for an intolerance component it is possible to scan subsequent similar components and reject those with an out of tolerance scan or scans.

## Description
Component InspectionThis invention relates to the inspection of a manufactured component.The term component is intended to cover not only an individual part but also sub assemblies and assemblies made up of any number of discrete items. In addition inspection is intended to cover dimensional measurement, verification, shape recognition and defect detection.The invention provides apparatus for inspecting a component, comprising means for imparting relative rotational and tran5tationa1 movement between the component and a scanner, the scanner being arranged to repeatedly measure the length between the boundaries of the component during the relative movement,and processing means for recording the maximum and minimum values of the measured length for the component.Typically there will be more than are maximum or minimum value recorded for each component. Advantageouslyf the scanner consists of a row of image sensors.Advantageously, the scanner is arranged to rotate, and a conveyor is provided for moving the component past the scanner.typical speeds of rotation are from 100 to 1000 revolutions per minute typical speeds for the conveyor are from 1 to 50 feet per minute typical speeds for the scanner are 0.1 to 10 millisecond for one scan and typically the scanner may consist of from 500 to 5000 image sensors e.g. photo diodes.Advantageously, the processing means is arranged to compare the recorded maximum and minimum values with predetermined maximum and minimum values to establish whether the component dimensions lie within tolerance limits. The invention also provides apparatus for inspecting a component which needs to lie within dimensional tolerances characterisai by a scanner a display means for presenting a component for inspection to the scanner and to enable relative movement to occur between component and a scanning field generated by the scanner a scanner output processing means whereby data values representing length between boundaries of the component can be compared one with another a sampler enabling the values to be sampled to identify a significant value arising from points of inflection in a series of such values a processor whereby the significant values are used to establish a characteristic signature or series of signatures for the component asd a comparator whereby the characteristic signature or series thereof can be. coRFared with a predetermined signature or signatures to establish whether the component lies within dimensional tolerances. The invention provides a means of obtaining the minimum amount of information necessary to establish a component integrity. It also minimises data analysis needed to achieve a hundred percent inspection of components in real time. An inspection system based on the invention does not require a component to be inspected to be precisely located relative to the scanning system and indeed the system allows for variable component placement.An exemplary embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings of which Figure 1 is a general pictorial view of an inspection system Figure 2 shows features of a rectangular section component subject to inspection of the system of Figure 1 Figure 3 shows a dimensional signature of the component of Figure 2 Figure 4 shows tolerance limits imposed on the signature of Figure 3 Figure 5 shows the results of presenting a component which is offset relative to that shown in Figure 2 Figure 6 shows a dimensional signature of the component of Figure 5 Figure 7 shows a faulty component Figure 8 shows the dimensional signature of the component of Figure 7 and Figure 9 shows a component of complex shape.Figure 1 shows a conveyor belt 11 adapted to carry components, typically component 12, in the direction of arrow 13 pass . a scanner head 14. The surface of the belt 11 together with lights 15 serve to provide a strongly contrasting background to the component 12 for optimised operation of the scanner head 14.The head 14 is rotated by way of a motor. The head 14 is made up of a row 18 of solid state image sensors directed to scan the surface of the belt 11. The number of sensors in the row 18 depends on the degree of definition required which in turn depends on the tolerance limits which are to be imposed on the component 12. The output of the sensor head 14 is fed through a data processing unit 19 which incorporates a micro processor. The unit 19 receives information as to the output of each sensor in the row 18 and subjects it to processing and sampling as will be .herinafter described.Figure 2 shows a view of component 12 as seen by the head 14 shown in Figures As referred to in connection withFigure 1 belt 11 carries component 12 passed the head in the direction of arrow 13. This linear movement together with rotation of the head 14 causes the row of sensors 18 to sense the component 12 as a series of displaced straight lines typically line A whose length changes during the period of relative movement of component and head. The contrasting background to the component 12 provided by the belt 11 and the light ensures that the ends of line A a function of the geometry of component 12 are sharply defined.The output of scanner 14 represents a measure of length of lineA will in the course of further relative movement indicate an increasing length of linear dimension up to an output representing line 3 which is a diagonal of the component 12. Further scanning will result in an output indicating a progressive reduction in length until an output representative of line C is reached whereupon the output will start again to represent a line of increasing length. Continued scanning will result in an output indicating an increase in length with a value representing line D is reached in respect of a decreasing length until the minimum length of a line effectively at 180 to line A is reached. This data is subject to in unit 19 to the extent that only outputs corresponding to the maxims or minima points of inflectionbrepresented by the ends of lines A to D are retained.This enables a signature of the component to be retiuned as shown in Figure 3. This shows a frequency spectrum wherein the X axis represent a function of time and the Y axis represents the output amptitude of the sensor. The four bars A are lettered to correspond with linesA to D. Figure 4 shows the graph of Figure 3 with tolerance levels imposed on it. For a given component as long as the length of line A lies between limits 41, 42 the component is acceptable in respect of this particular dimension.The precise location of component 12 on belt 11 does not affect the utilisation of tht scanner. Figure 5 shows a component 50 of similar form to component 12 of Figure 1 but being carried along belt 51 at an angle to the belts direction of travel shown by arrow 52. The length of line corresponding to diagonals 53, 54 and major and minor axis 55, 56 of the component will provide a signature shown in Figure 6 of identical form to that shown in Figure 3 and 4. Figure 7 and 8 show a defective component and its signature.Figure 7 shows a component 71 on belt 72 having a defect in the form of a recess 73. In this case a scan similar to that described in connection with Figures 1 to 4 will reveal a signature wherein a number of additional naxilia or minima producing additional significan lengths retained in the processor unit being recorded. Only outputs 1 and 2 corresponding to diage of the component and outputs 3 and 4 corresponding to the major and minor axis respectively will be comparable with that of an acceptable component. There will now also be three additional outputs 5,6,7 caused by the existence of the defect 73 which create maxima or minima which will be retained by the processor as signifirantvalues. The signature of the component 73 is shown in Figure 8 with the bars 1 7 numbered to correspond with the dimension of the compoment 71. The processor 19 has suitable programmes to cause the rejection of the component at a suitable point in the travel of belt 51.The processor 19 permits storage of several previously identified signatures which can be re called for use by simple interaction with suitable input output devices. In addition new programmes can be entered by a self generating process of storing maximtirn and mininm values derived from a master or other acceptable component. Such programmes would later be verified and toleranced by a system operator.Straight forward mathematical equations enable initial analysis and filtering of incoming information to be acheived. Other algorithms can be used to obtain obscure or otherwise Xncompatible dimensional information. Comparison of generated data can also be used to varify specific details to meet overall inspection requirements. This enables complex shapes to be simplified to that of straight line functions. typically Figure 9 shows a screw thread which can be subjected to a scanning process as hereinbefore described. The output represented by the length of section 80 will clearly be repeated as the scanning process continues. The root diameter 81 needs to be recorded only once a minimum value and a maximum value correoponding to the crest diameter 82 will also only need to be recorded once. Thus a relatively small number of values will be needed to create a signature for an acceptable screw thread.
