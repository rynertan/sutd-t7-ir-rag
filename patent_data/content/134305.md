# Permanent magnet.

## Abstract
A magnetically anisotropic sintered permanent m of the FeBR system in which R is sum of R₁ and R₂ wh R₁ is Dy, Tb, Gd, Ho, Tm and or Yb, and R₂ comprises 80 at or more of Nd and Pr in R₂ and the balance of at least one of other rare earth elements exclusive of R₁, said system comprising by atomic percent, 0.05 to 5 of R₁, 12.5 to 20 of R, 4 to 20 of B, and the balance being Fe with impurities. Additional elements M Ti, Zr, Hf, Cr, Mn, Ni, Ta, Ge, Sn, Sb, Bi, Mo, Nb, Al, V, W, may be present.
