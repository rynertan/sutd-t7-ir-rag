## Description
The present invention relates to magnetooptic garnets adaptable for use in Faraday rotators which are used in optical fiber transmission systems. As disclosed in U.S. patent No. 4,522,473 granted to Hibiya et al, Faraday rotators are used as optical isolators, optical circulators, and optical switches in optical fiber transmission systems. The Faraday rotator comprises a non magnetic garnet substrate and a magnetooptic garnet film. The magnetooptic garnet is epitaxially grown on the substrate. Recently, it has been proposed to use an epitaxially grown GdBi ₃ FeAlGa ₅O₁₂ garnet as the magnetooptic garnet film of the Faraday rotator in order to reduce a cost of the Faraday rotator. A reference is made to a paper WK1 in Conference on Optical Fiber Communication held in San Diego, California, U.S.A. in February, 1985. Faraday rotation coefficient of GdBi ₃ FeAlGa ₅O₁₂ garnet has a large temperature characteristic and considerably varies in dependence on a circumference temperature. Even if an angle of Faraday rotation of a Faraday rotator is insured to be 45 In Journal of Physics D. , Applied Physics, Vol. 17, No. 3, 1984, pp. 579 587 temperature coefficients of the Faraday rotation angle of a Dy₃Fe₅O₁₂ garnet are disclosed. However, no means are described for reducing the temperature dependency for this garnet. It is an object of the present invention to provide magnetooptic garnet having a reduced temperature characteristic of the Faraday rotation coefficient for use in the 1.3 µm and 1.5 µm wavelength bands of electromagnetic waves, to thereby enable to provide an optical isolator having an isolation stabilized. A magnetooptic garnet according to the present invention is a compound represented by a formula DY Prior to description of examples of garnet of the present invention, the temperature characteristic of Faraday rotation of GdBi ₃ FeAlGa ₅O₁₂ is explained referring to Figs. 1 and 2. Referring to Fig. 1, the Faraday rotation angle of a Faraday rotator using GdBi ₃ FeAlGa ₅O₁₂ garnet film varies in response to temperature variation as shown in the figure, for use in the 1.5 µm wavelength band of the electromagnetic wave. Due to the variation of the Faraday rotation angle, isolation is lowered according to deviation from 45 In this connection, isolation is defined by the following equation The present invention attempts to provide a garnet having Bi ions and Dy ions at lattice sites represented by 24c in the garnet crystal whereby the temperature characteristic of Faraday rotation of the garnet is reduced. Thus, an optical isolator can be obtained with a stabilized operation even under a temperature variation.
