# Instant on light source.

## Abstract
A light source includes a high pressure discharge lamp 26 and incandescent filaments 24 and 30 which provide illumination during the warm up and hot restart periods associated with the discharge lamp 26 . A current regulator 22 , which provides dc power to the discharge lamp 26 , draws sufficient current through one filament 24 to energize the filament 24 only during discharge lamp 26 warm up. A second filament 30 provides illu mination during the period after the occurrence of a mo mentary power failure or power transient which is required by the discharge lamp 26 to cool down to its maximum starting temperature. A bimetal switch 32 permits current flow through the second filament 30 when the discharge lamp 26 is above the maximum starting temperature. An electronic switch 34 permits current flow through the second filament 30 when a current sensing resistor 28 senses a lack of current through the discharge lamp 26 .
