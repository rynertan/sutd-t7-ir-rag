# PACKAGE FOR CIGARETTES, CIGARS AND SIMILAR ARTICLES, AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING SAME

## Abstract
The cigarettes S are introduced into shells 1 of plastics material, made by a thermoforming process from a contin uous sheet. The shells are so shaped as to be provided with seats 3 , whereby the cigarettes will remain positioned prop erly within said shells, both while being packaged and while being used. The cigarettes are deposited into said shells, and thereafter a continuous sheet S of aluminum material is heat sealed on the peripheral edges of the shells. A pull tape 6 is positioned longitudinally under said covering sheet. By a blanking operation, the closed shells containing the ciga rettes are then severed from the continuous sheets from which they have been made. The edge 101 of the shell adjacent to one row of cigarette ends is lower than the other edges 101 and may be even co planar with the bottom of said shell. The edges that are adjacent to said lower edge merge therewith through inclined portions 101 . By re moving the portion of covering sheet 5 at said lower edge 101 , the cigarettes can be easily withdrawn unharmed from said shell.
