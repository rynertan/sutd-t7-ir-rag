# Self supporting structures containing immobilized inorganic sorbent particles and method for forming same.

## Abstract
A self supporting structure comprising an inorganic sorbent and method for preparing is described in which the self supporting structure is substantially free of sorbent fines and the sorption characteristics of the sorbent particles is retained. The process for immobilizing the sorbent particles in the self supporting structure comprises the steps of a preheating inorganic sorbent particles to an elevated temperature b mixing the sorbent particles with particles of a polymeric binding material to form a mixture comprising the particles of polymeric binding material adhered to the sorbent particles and c heating the mixture to about the solid liquid transi tion temperature of the polymeric binding material with or without pressure to form a structure which upon cooling is self supporting.
