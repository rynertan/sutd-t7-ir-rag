## Description
The invention relates to novel cholecalciferol derivatives, a process for their manufacture, novel intermediates therefor and medicaments based on the former cholecalciferol derivatives. The cholecalciferol derivatives in accordance with the invention are the 26,26,26 trifluoro 1α,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol, particularly in form of the 25R epimer essentially free of the 25S epimer, and of the 25S epimer essentially free of the 25R epimer. In accordance with the invention, these compounds are prepared by reacting a compound of the formula The above reaction can be carried out at reduced temperatures, e.g. below 50 C, preferably at about 78 C, under an inert, e.g. an argan atmosphere, in an inert solvent, such as a cylic ether, preferably tetrahydrofurun THF . The conversion of the phosphine oxide to the corresponding carbanion can be accomplished by initially treating the phosphine oxide with an alkyl lithium, e.g. b butyl lithium. Removal of the trialkylsilyl protecting group can be accomplished by treating the reaction product with a cation exchange resin under ambient conditions, in a solvent, such as a halogenated alkane, preferably methylene chloride. The resulting products can be purified e.g. by chromatography on silica gel. As used throughout the specification and claims, lower alkyl refers to a straight or branched chain alkyl group with 1 8 C atoms, e.g. methyl, ethyl, n propyl, i propyl and t butyl. Aryl means phenyl optionally substituted by alkyl, halogene, nitro, cyano and trifluoromethyl. Examples of aralkyl groups are benzyl and phenethyl. The indenone starting materials utilized in the above mentioned process can be prepared as follows 1R 1β, αS , βS ,3aα,4aβ,7aβ Octahydro β,7a dimethyl 4 1,1 dimethylethyl dimethylsilyloxy α ethenyl 1H indene 1 ethanol is converted to 1R 1β R ,3aα, 4β,7aβ 1 4 chloro 1 methyl 2 butenyl octahydro 4 1,1 dimethylethyl dimethylsilyloxy 7a methyl 1H indene by treatment with thionyl chloride followed by pyridine. The resulting allylic chloride is then reacted with an aryl sulfinic acid salt, e.g. benzene sulfinic acid sodium salt, to yield the corresponding arylsulfonyl compound, e.g. 1R 1β R ,3aα,4β,7aβ 1 4 phenylsulfonyl 1 methyl 2 butenyl octahydro 4 1,1 dimethylethyl dimethylsilyloxy 7a methyl 1H indene. The aforesaid indene is then catalytically hydrogenated using a palladium on carbon Pd C catalyst to prove the corresponding side chain saturated compound 1R 1β R ,3aα,4β,7aβ 1 4 phenylsulfonyl 1 methylbutyl octahydro 4 1,1 dimethylethyl dimethylsilyloxy 7a methyl 1H indene. The completion of the side chain to produce a compound of formula I below, is accomplished by reacting the carbanion of the aforesaid sulfonyl compound, formed by treatment with n butyl lithium or lithium diisopropylamide, with trifluoroacetone. In the obtained compound of the formula A compound of formula I, as a mixture of epimers at the 4 position in the side chain, can be dearysulfonylated with an alkali metal or with an alkali metal amalgam, in the presence of an alkali metal phosphate, in an inert organic solvent, such as a lower alkanol, a cyclic ether or preferably a mixture thereof. Preferred reactant are sodium amalgam and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate. Preferred solvents include methanol, THF and mixtures thereof. The alkali metal amalgam addition is carried out with cooling, preferably at temperatures below 0 C, most preferably at about 20 C. The product of the reaction, after purification, e.g. by chromatography on silica gel, can be reacted with an epoxidation agent, such as a peracid, preferably trifluoroperacetic acid, at reduced temperatures, e.g. at 0 C. Preferably the reaction is carried out in the presence of an inorganic base, e.g. a phosphate base, preferably dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, in an inert organic solvent, e.g. a halogenated alkyl or aryl solvent, preferably methylene chloride. Under the conditions of the reaction, part of the resulting product may consist of the desilylated product. Thus the product of the reaction is a mixture of the protected and unprotected compounds of formula After purification, e.g. flash by chromatography, one of the components of the above mixture or the two components of formula II can be treated with a reducing agent, e.g. an alkali metal or a metal hydride, preferably lithium aluminum hydride, in an inert organic solvent, e.g. an alkyl ether, such as ethyl ether, preferably under ambient conditions and under an inert atmosphere, e.g. of argon. There is thus produced the corresponding protected and or unprotected compounds of formula The deprotected compound of formula III can then be treated with an oxidative agent, such as a chromate salt, particularly with a basic organic amine, e.g. a pyridinium halochromate, preferably pyridinium chlorochromate. The reaction is conveniently carried out under ambient conditions, in an inert solvent such as a halogenated alkane, e.g. a chloroalkane, preferably methylene chloride. There is obtained the ketone of the formula IV above, wherein Y stands for hydrogen. The obtained ketone can then be treated without isolation, with a reagent introducing a trimethylsilyl protecting group on the side chain hydroxy, e.g. with trimethylsilylimidazole, at ambient temperature under an inert atmosphere. The resulting protected compounds have the formula IV, wherein Y is trialkylated Si. The compounds of formulae I and IV wherein Y is hydrogen or trialkylated Si, are novel and as such form part of the invention. 26,26,26 Trifluoro 1α,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol has vitamin D₃ like activity and exhibit anti proliferative and differentiation inducing effects. These anti proliferative and differentiation inducing effects on HL 60 cells can be demonstrated in vitro utilizing known procedures, e.g. as described in Progress in Cancer Research and Therapy, Vol. 23 Maturation Factors and Cancer, Ed. M.A.S. Moore, Raven Press, N.Y. 1982 Nature 270 1977 347 9 and Blood 54 1979 429 39. The results obtained are set out in the following table The data in the table indicate that the 26,26,26 trifluoro 1α,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol, particularly in the 25R or 25S form, restrain the proliferation of human promyelocytic tumor cells in vitro, even though they were not toxic to the cells. Furthermore, cells cultured in low concentrations of these compounds 10 ⁹ to 10 ⁸ molar were induced to differentiate toward a more mature cell type as evidenced by the acquisition of enzyme activity and cellular function. It can be expected that the above compounds are useful in treating diseases, such as neoplastic diseases, which owe in part to aberrant cellular proliferation and or differentiation. The above compounds can be administered in dosages in the range of about 0.10 3.0, preferably 0.25 2.0 µg per day for the treatment of such disease states as osteoporosis, osteodystrophy, steroid induced osteopenia, hypoparathyroidism, hypophosphatemic rickets and hypophosphatemic osteomalacia, which are characterized by lower than normal levels of endogeneously produced 1α,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol. The above compounds can be administered in the same dosage range for the treatment of proliferative disease states, such as leukemia. They can be administered orally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intravenously, intraperitoneally or topically. They can be formulated into compositions, such as tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administration, or in sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral administration. About 0.10 3.0, preferably 0.25 2.0 µg of the above compounds can be compounded in a unit dosage, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, carrier, preservative, stabilizer, binder, e.g. gum tragacanth, excipient, e.g. calcium phosphate, disintegrating agent, e.g. corn starch, lubricant, e.g. magnesium stearate, buffer, antioxidant, sweetening agent, e.g. sucrose, flavoring agent, e.g. peppermint.
