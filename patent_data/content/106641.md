# Polymerizable composition for information carrying systems.

## Abstract
Polymerizable compositions comprising monoethylenic ally unsaturated monomer, polyethylenically unsaturated monomer, a polymer soluble in the combination of monom ers, and latent free radical initiator provides good adhesion to substrates and durability. The composition is particularly useful in manufacturing video discs.
