## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device including a bipolar transistor, in particular, a bipolar transistor with high speed characteristics, and to a method of manufacturing such a semiconductor device. In order to improve the high speed characteristics of a bipolar transistor, it is necessary to form shallow emitter and base diffusion regions. In view of this, a conventional semiconductor device has an emitter electrode comprising a polysilicon layer and an emitter formed in a semiconductor region using the emitter electrode as a diffusion source. A device formed in this manner has the following structure. An n type buried region is formed in a p type silicon substrate, and a vertical npn transistor is fabricated on the buried region. The npn transistor consists of an n type epitaxial layer surrounded by a field oxide layer and formed in the buried region, a p type active base region formed on the epitaxial layer, an external base region and an n type emitter region formed in the active base region, and an n type collector contact region formed in the buried region to be isolated from the emitter and base regions by an isolation region. The n type emitter region is connected to an aluminum electrode through a polysilicon layer. An aluminum base electrode is connected to the external base region and the n type collector contact region. Electrodes consisting of aluminum layers are connected to the collector contact region. In the vertical transistor of the semiconductor device described above, arsenic is doped in a polysilicon layer forming an emitter electrode, and a shallow n type emitter region is formed in the active base region using the polysilicon layer as a diffusion source. In an I²L device, a boron doped polysilicon layer is used as a diffusion source for forming a collector region for the vertical transistor. The polysilicon layer is also used to connect logic gate elements. A conventional semiconductor device of the type described above, wherein an impurity doped polysilicon layer is used as an electrode and an impurity region is formed as a diffusion source in a semiconductor region, has the following problems In the case of an I²L device, the impurity concentration cannot be increased beyond a predetermined value for the same reason as described above. The resistance of the polysilicon layer and the wiring resistance are increased, thus interfering with high speed operation. In addition, since a voltage drop occurs between an output electrode of one logic gate element and an input electrode of another logic gate element, a desired output level cannot be obtained and the inverter operation cannot be performed. From EP A 0 051 500 it is known to provide an emitter electrode and a base electrode separated from said emitter electrode by an insulating layer in which both the emitter and the base electrodes are used as diffusion sources for the impurities used to form emitter and base regions in a semiconductor substrate. As emitter electrode or base electrode, a layer of molybdenum silicide doped with phosphorus on a polysilicon layer may be used. With this arrangement it is possible to make the space between the base and emitter electrodes small as well as maintaining low resistance electrodes. US A 3 762 966 describes a method of diffusing N type and P type impurities from a single doped semiconductor layer into a substrate in order to generate accurate thin P type base regions when the diffusion rate of the P type impurity is faster than for the N type impurity. It is an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor device wherein the electrode resistance is limited to a sufficiently small value and high speed operation characteristics can be improved and a method of manufacturing such a semiconductor device. According to the present invention, a method of manufacturing a bipolar semiconductor device, comprises the steps of selectively forming a field insulation layer on a semiconductor layer of a first conductivity type so as to isolate said semiconductor layer into a plurality of first semiconductor regions at least one of said first semiconductor regions forming a collector or emitter region respectively preforming a first base region on said collector or emitter region, by doping an impurity of the second conductivity type into said collector or emitter region forming one of a polycide layer formed by laminating a polysilicon layer with a metal silicide layer, a laminated layer of a polysilicon layer and a refractory metal layer and a metal silicide layer on said collector or emitter region so as to be in contact with part of said collector or emitter region and to have one end extending over said field insulation layer and doping the one of said polycide layer, said laminated layer and said metal silicide layer with impurities of first and second conductivity types and diffusing the impurities of the first and second conductivity types into said first base region to form a second base region and an emitter or collector region respectively therein using the one of said polycide layer, said laminated layer and said metal silicide layer as a diffusion source. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which As shown in Fig. 1A, an N type impurity such as antimony Sb is diffused into the surface of P type silicon substrate 21 to form N type buried region 22₁ for a vertical NPN transistor and N type buried region 22₂ for an I²L element. N type epitaxial layer 23 is then formed on the entire surface of the resultant semiconductor structure. A P type impurity such as boron is selectively diffused in layer 23 to form P type isolation layer 24 in layer 23 for isolating the NPN transistor and I²L element. An N type impurity such as phosphorus is selectively diffused in layer 23 to form N type diffusion region a collector ohmic region for the NPN transistor 25 extending to region 22₁ and an N type diffusion region or an emitter ohmic region not shown extending to region 22₂. In the process shown in Fig. 1B, buried field oxide layer 26 is formed in layer 23 to extend as far as regions 22₁ and 22₂ by a selective oxidation. Layer 26 isolates the bipolar transistor from the I²L element. Oxide layer 27₁ for fabricating the NPN transistor as a sidewall base contact structure and oxide layer 27₂ for isolating the injector transistor and the inverter transistor of the I²L element are formed on regions 22₁ and 22₂. Layers 26, 27₁ and 27₂ can be formed simultaneously as in this embodiment or separately. Oxide layer 28 having a thickness of 50 100 n m 500 to 1000 Å is formed in a region for forming the bipolar transistor and the I²L element. Boron is selectively ion implanted in the epitaxial layer using layer 28 as a buffer layer to form P type active base region 29 for the NPN transistor and active base regions 30₁ and 30₂ for the I²L element. Selective etching is then performed to form opening windows for forming an emitter diffusion region in oxide layer 28 covering the surface of active base region 29 of the NPN transistor, and to remove oxide layer 28 covering the collector region of the I²L element. In the process shown in Fig. 1C, undoped polysilicon layer 32 having a thickness of 50 200 n m 500 to 2000 Å is deposited by the CVD method on the entire surface of the resultant semiconductor structure shown in Fig. 1B. Phosphorus is then doped in layer 32 at a dose of 2 to 20 x 10¹⁵ cm ² by the ion implantation method. A refractory metal silicide is deposited on layer 32 to a thickness of 100 300 n m 1000 to 3000 Å and annealed. Resultant polysilicide layer 33 is patterned by selective etching to form emitter electrode 34 for the NPN transistor and collector electrodes 35₁ and 35₂ and input wiring 36 for the I²L element. At the same time, mask patterns 38₁ and 38₂ for forming the next external base region and injector region are formed. In the process shown in Fig. 1D, boron is ion implanted in epitaxial layer 23 and regions 29, 30₁ and 30₂ using polycide patterns 34, 35₁, 35₂, 36, 37₁, 37₂, 38₁ and 38₂ and buried oxide layers 26, 27₁ and 27₂ as masks. Then, P type external base region 39 for the NPN transistor, and P type external base regions 40₁ and 40₂ and P type injector region 41 for the I²L element are formed. The surface of polysilicide layer 33 is preferably protected by an insulation film or a resist film which prevents the ion implantation of boron so that boron ions do not directly impinge upon polycide patterns 34, 35₁, 35₂, 36, 37₁, 37₂, 38₁, and 38₂. In the process shown in Fig. 1E, arsenic is doped in regions 29, 30₁ and 30₂ using polycide emitter electrode 34 and polycide collector electrodes 35₁ and 35₂ as a diffusion source. Then, N type emitter region 42 for the NPN transistor and N type collector regions 43₁ and 43₂ for the I²L element are fabricated. SiO₂ insulation film 44 is formed on the surface of the resultant structure by the CVD method, and a contact hole is formed therein. An aluminum film is deposited on the entire semiconductor substrate including film 44. The aluminum film is patterned to form electrodes 45 to 49. Electrodes 45, 46 and 47 respectively constitute emitter, base and collector terminals of the NPN transistor. Electrode 48 is an injector terminal of the I²L element and electrode 49 is an input wiring line. In the above example, in the bipolar type semiconductor device shown in Fig. 1E, since the concentration of the impurity doped in the polycide film is controlled to be an optimal value, diffusion for forming the emitter region of the NPN transistor and the collector region of the I²L element can be performed normally, and a shallow junction can be obtained. Thus, a bipolar transistor having excellent high speed operation characteristics is obtained. Moreover, since refractory metal silicide layer 33 constituting a polycide film has a low resistance, the electrode wiring formed by this polycide film has a low resistance. Therefore, the emitter of the NPN transistor has a very small resistance of several ohms. The high speed operation characteristics of the inverter transistor in the I²L element are improved over conventional devices, and a voltage drop across the wiring when a polycide output wiring is used between logic gates is limited. The operation range of the logic gate is thus wider than other conventional devices. The metal silicide is preferably a silicide of a refractory metal, such as tungsten silicide WSi , molybdenum silicide MoSi , or titanium silicide TiSi . Figs. 2A and 2B show a semiconductor device having an improved emitter structure using a polycide. N type buried region 52 is formed in P type silicon substrate 51. N type epitaxial layer 53 is formed on region 52. Buried oxide layer field oxide layer 54 is formed in layer 53. Layer 53, defined by layer 54, constitutes a collector region of the vertical transistor. Active base region 55 of a sidewall base contact structure is formed in the surface of collector region 53 to be in contact with field oxide layer 54. Two separated N type emitter regions 56₁ and 56₂ are formed in base region 55. Regions 56₁ and 56₂ are surrounded by P type external base region 57. Emitter electrodes 58₁ and 58₂ are formed above emitter regions 56₁ and 56₂ by patterning a laminated layer of a polysilicon layer and a metal silicide layer, so called, polycide layer, a laminated layer of a polysilicon layer and refractory metal layer, or a metal silicide layer and are in ohmic contact with emitter regions 56₁ and 56₂. An N type impurity such as arsenic is doped in the layer forming electrodes 58₁ and 58₂, and regions 56₁ and 56₂ are formed in active base region 55 using electrodes 58₁ and 58₂ as a diffusion source. Emitter electrodes 58₁ and 58₂ are covered with insulation layer 59 such as an SiO₂ layer formed by the CVD method. An SiO₂ or Si₃N₄ layer formed by the CVD method is formed as interlayer insulator 60 on field oxide layer 54. An opening for connection with a transistor region, i.e., N type epitaxial region 53 and a part of layer 54 surrounding this region, is formed in interlayer insulator 60. An aluminum based layer is deposited on insulator 60 including the opening. The aluminum based layer is patterned to form base electrode 61 over insulator 60. Base electrode 61 crosses emitter electrodes 58₁ and 58₂ through insulating layer 59 and is in ohmic contact with external base region 57 at both sides of electrodes 58₁ and 58₂. In the vertical NPN transistor shown in the plan view in Fig. 2A, edge 54a of field oxide layer 54 is illustated by a thick solid line. The transistor region surrounded by layer 54 has a rectangular shape. Base electrode 61 formed by over locos localized oxidation covers the entire surface of the transistor region and extends to the outside. The edges of emitter electrodes 58₁ and 58₂ formed of a laminated layer of a polysilicon layer and a metal silicide layer, so called, polycide layer, a laminated layer of a polysilicon layer and a refractory metal layer, or a metal silicide layer extend from below base electrode 61 to above field oxide layer 54, and corresponding ends of the same electrodes are coupled by layer 58 formed of a laminated layer of a polysilicon layer and a metal silicide layer, so called, polycide layer, a laminated layer of a polysilicon layer and a refractory metal layer, or a metal silicide layer. In this embodiment, layer 58 formed on layer 60 outside electrode 61 serves as a basis. Two emitter electrodes 58₁ and 58₂ are formed by a single pattern extending from this base, and the overall pattern constitutes an emitter of one NPN transistor. The emitter electrode is wired with an aluminum based material. Connection of the emitter electrode to other circuit elements is performed at basis 58 on field oxide layer 54. Although not shown in Figs. 2A and 2B, an N type collector contact region extending to N type buried region 52 and a collector electrode in ohmic contact with the contact region are formed. As in the above example, two emitter regions 56₁ and 56₂ are formed inside single base region 55. With this structure, the emitter region is enlarged and a transistor having a high current capacity is obtained. In order to double the size of the emitter region in a conventional device, the length of the region must be doubled. However, in this example , two emitter regions are aligned parallel to each other. The effect obtained with this emitter structure will be described with reference to Figs. 3A to 3E and Fig. 4. Fig. 3A shows a pattern of a standard transistor. In this pattern, assuming emitter area S In the above example, there are 2 emitter regions. However, 3 or more emitter regions can be formed. Fig. 3C shows a transistor pattern having 3 emitter regions when S Fig. 4 shows a graph of the value of S As described above, since the emitter region can be enlarge without unnecessarily enlarging the base region, the gain hfe of the transistor can be maintained at its initial value and at the same time the transistor can be used with a large current. As can be seen from a comparison of Figs. 3B and 3D, the NPN transistor has effective high frequency characteristics in a large current region. In a conventional transistor, when S Since the emitter electrode of a laminated layer formed of a polysilicon layer and a metal silicide layer laminated on the polysilicon layer, so called, polycide layer, a laminated layer formed of a polysilicon layer and a refractory metal layer laminated on the polysilicon layer, or a metal silicide layer and the emitter electrode of an aluminum based layer are connected outside the transistor region, even if contact region 58 is large, the transistor dimensions can still be kept small. In other conventional transistors, the contact hole of the base electrode must be formed with a sufficient two dimensional margin with respect to the transistor region and thus requires an extra area. Fig. 5 shows a pattern of an NPN transistor. One end of each of two emitter electrodes 58₁ and 58₂ is formed integrally from patterned layer 58 as in Fig. 2A, and the other end is also integrally connected by patterned layer 58 formed of a laminated layer of a polysilicon layer and a metal silicide layer, so called, polycide layer, a laminated layer of a polysilicon layer and a refractory metal layer, or a metal silicide layer. Emitter electrodes are similarly connected to layer 58 by an aluminum based wiring metal. In the example shown in Fig. 5, an emitter current flows to both emitter electrodes 58₁ and 58₂. Therefore, the emitter resistance is decreased to one half, and the voltage drop at the emitter electrodes is reduced. As a result, the high speed operation characteristics in a high current region and device reliability are improved. Fig. 6A and 6B show still another example in which three emitter regions 56₁, 56₂ and 56₃ are formed, and three emitter electrodes 58₁, 58₂ and 58₃ are arranged for these emitter regions. A base electrode formed by the over locos method comprises a laminated electrode of boron doped polysilicon layer 61 and aluminum based wiring metal layer 61. P type external base region 57 is formed in region 55 using layer 61 as a diffusion source. With this structure, short circuiting between the base and collector due to electrode penetration that the base electrode penetrates the base region can be prevented. In the example shown in Figs. 2A and 2B, when base electrode 61 is directly connected to external base region 57 by an aluminum based wiring metal and metallized, the aluminum based wiring metal can migrate into the silicon layer and cause breakdown at the base collector junction. In contrast to this, in the example shown in Figs. 6A and 6B, since base electrode 61 comprising a polysilicon layer is formed below the base electrode comprising an aluminum based wiring metal, base electrode 61 prevents the migration of metal ions into the silicon layer and subsequent break down at the base collector junction. In the above examples, if a polycide obtained by laminating a metal silicide on a polysilicon layer, a laminated layer of a refractory metal film and a polysilicon layer, a metal silicide layer, or a refractory metal film alone is used for emitter electrodes 58₁, 58₂, 58₃, 58 and 58 , the emitter resistance can be further reduced. When a refractory metal film is used, emitter regions are not formed in self alignment using emitter electrodes as a diffusion source. The material for the emitter electrodes can be a polysilicon layer, a polycide layer, a film of a refractory metal such as tungsten, titanium or molybdenum, or a laminated structure of such a refractory metal film formed on a polysilicon layer. The base electrode can comprise not only a laminated layer formed of a polysilicon layer and an aluminum layer but also a laminated layer of a polysilicon layer and a metal silicide layer, so called, polycide layer, a laminated layer of a polysilicon layer and a refractory metal layer, or a metal silicide layer and a layer laminated with an aluminum layer thereon polysilicon or polycide. In the process shown in Fig. 7A, an N type impurity such as Sb is selectively diffused from the surface of P type silicon substrate 71 to form N type buried region 72₁ for a vertical NPN transistor and N type buried region 72₂ for an I²L element. Thereafter, N type epitaxial silicon layer 73 is formed on the entire surface including regions 72₁ and 72₂. Layer 73 has an impurity concentration of 10¹⁵ to 10¹⁶ cm² and a thickness of 1 to 3 µm. Thermal oxide insulating layer 74 is formed on the surface of layer 73. Opening windows for forming isolation regions are selectively formed in insulating layer 74. Boron doped silicon oxide layer BSG layer 75 is deposited on the entire surface of insulating layer 74 including the windows. Boron is selectively diffused into layer 73 using BSG layer 75 as a diffusion source to form P type isolation region 76 for isolating the NPN transistor and the I²L element in layer 73. In this isolation process, the ion implantation of boron and thermal diffusion can be simultaneously performed depending on the impurity concentration and diffusion depth of P type isolation region 76. In the process shown in Fig. 7B, after BSG boron silicate glass layer 75 and thermal oxide insulating layer 74 are removed, another thermal oxide insulating layer 77 is formed on layer 73, and a window opening for forming collector region 79 for the vertical NPN transistor is formed in layer 77. Phosphosilicate glass layer PSG layer 78 is deposited on the entire surface of layer 77 including the window. Phosphorus is selectively diffused in epi layer 73, using PSG layer 78 as a diffusion source to form N type collector contact region 79 extending to region 72₁. In this process, an N type diffusion region extending to region 72₂, i.e., an emitter contact region not shown for the I²L element is also formed. In this case, phosphorus is diffused by a combination of ion implantaion and thermal diffusion. In the process shown in Fig. 7D, epitaxial layer 73 is selectively etched and oxidized using silicon nitride layer 81 as an anti oxidation mask to form field oxide layer 82, oxide isolation layer 83₁ and oxide isolation layer 83₂ in layer 73. Layer 82 is a buried oxide layer having a thickness of 800 1000 n m 8,000 to 10,000 Å and serves to isolate elements. Layer 83₁ gives the NPN transistor a sidewall contact structure. Layer 83₂ isolates the injector transistor and two output transistors of the I²L element. After silicon nitride layer 81 anti oxidation mask and oxide layer 80 are removed, the surfaces of the element regions are thermally oxidized and thermal oxide layer 84 having a thickness of 50 100 n m 500 to 1000 Å is formed. In the selective oxidation process described above, buried oxide regions 82, 83₁ and 83₂ must extend as far as N type buried regions 72₁ and 72₂ in order to isolate the gates the high speed I²L elements. In the process shown in Fig. 7E, boron ions are injected in a region for forming an injector transistor for the I²L element using thermal oxide layer 84 as a buffer layer and a patterned photoresist layer as a mask to form P type emitter region 85 and P type collector region 86 in the I²L element fabricating region to be isolated from each other. In order to form regions 87, 88₁ and 88₂, boron ions are alternately injected into corresponding surface regions using separate photoresist layers. Thermal oxide layer 84, covering prospective active base region 87 of the NPN transistor, and thermal oxide layer 88, covering the surfaces of prospective active base regions 88₁ and 88₂ of the I²L element, are selectively etched. In the process shown in Fig. 7F, undoped polysilicon layer 89 is deposited to a thickness of 50 200 n m 500 to 2000 Å on the entire surface of the semiconductor device shown in Fig. 7E. Thereafter, arsenic is doped in polysilicon layer 89 at a dose of 2 to 20 x 10¹⁵ cm ². Refractory metal silicide e.g., MoSi₂ layer 90 having a thickness of 100 300 n m 1000 to 3000 Å is formed on the entire surface of layer 89. SiO₂ layer 91 is formed on the entire surface of layer 90 by the CVD method. The resultant semiconductor structure is annealed at about 900 C so that the impurity ions in the polysilicon layer are uniformly distributed. When annealing is performed at about 900 C, arsenic in the polycide is not doped in the epitaxial layer. In the process shown in Fig. 7G, a stacked structure of a polycide layer and an SiO₂ layer is patterned by selective etching to form, on the stacked structure, emitter electrode pattern 92 and collector electrode pattern 93 for the NPN transistor and collector electrode patterns 94₁ and 94₂ for the I²L element. Upon this patterning, input wiring pattern 95, jumper wiring pattern 96, and mask pattern 97 for emitter region 85 and collector region 86 of a lateral PNP injector transistor are simultaneously formed on the stacked structure. Thereafter, SiO₂ layer 98 having a thickness of 300 500 n m 3000 to 5000 Å is formed on the entire surface of the semiconductor structure including the patterned layers by the plasma CVD method. In the process shown in Fig. 7H, SiO₂ layer 98 is etched by a distance corresponding to its thickness by anisotropic etching using RIE reactive ion etching to remove all of SiO₂ layer 98 except for portions on the side walls of polycide patterns 92, 93, 94₁, 94₂, 95, 96 and 97. These polycide patterns are thus covered by SiO₂ layers 91 and 98. Thin thermal oxide layer 84, covering the surface of the injector transistor fabricating regions in the I²L element, is removed by RIE except for a portion covered by mask pattern 87. In the process shown in Fig. 7I, undoped polysilicon layer 99 is deposited on the entire surface of the semiconductor structure shown in Fig. 7H. Boron ions are then injected into polysilicon layer 99. In the process shown in Fig. 7J, layer 99 is patterned by selective etching to form, in layer 99, base electrode pattern 100 for the vertical NPN transistor, base electrode patterns 101₁ and 101₂ for the I²L element, and emitter electrode pattern 103 and collector electrode pattern 104 for the injector PNP transistor. These electrode patterns cross over the polycide electrode patterns through SiO₂ layers 91 and 98 and extend over the buried oxide films by the over locos method. A thin thermal oxide layer, SiO₂ layer 105 and silicon nitride layer 106 are stacked as an interlayer insulator. Arsenic is then diffused in a corresponding region using the polycide patterns as a diffusion source in an atmosphere at 900 to 1,000 C, and at the same time boron is diffused in a corresponding region using the polysilicon patterns as a diffusion source. Then, N type emitter region 107 and P type external base region 108 for the vertical NPN transistor, and N type collector regions 109₁ and 109₂ and P type base regions 110₁ and 110₂ for the I²L element are formed. In the process shown in Fig. 7K, after contact holes are formed in the stacked structure of layers 105 and 106, an aluminum based metal wiring layer is deposited and metal wiring patterns 111 to 114 are patterned. Terminal 111 is a base terminal for the vertical NPN transistor, and terminal 112 is a collector terminal thereof. Terminal 113 is an injector terminal for the I²L element, and terminal 114 is a common input wiring pattern thereof. The emitter metal wiring pattern of the vertical NPN transistor is not shown in Fig. 7K. However, as shown in Fig. 8, polycide emitter electrode pattern 92 extends from below polysilicon base electrode pattern 100 onto the buried oxide films, and a metal wiring pattern is formed in contact with the resultant contact region. In the processes shown in Figs. 7A to 7K, external base regions 108, 110₁, and 110₂ are formed in corresponding semiconductor regions using polysilicon base electrode patterns 100 and 101₁ and 101₂ formed by the over locos method as a diffusion source. Therefore, the emitter to base distance of the vertical NPN transistor, and the collector to external base distance of the I²L element can be reduced to a minimum within an allowable breakdown voltage range. In the vertical NPN transistor shown in Fig. 9, N type emitter region 107 and P type external base region 108 are formed in self alignment using electrode patterns 92 and 100 as a diffusion source. Therefore, a mask alignment margin is not necessary for forming external base regions, unlike in conventional semiconductor devices. The collector to external base distance can be reduced within an allowable breakdown voltage range in accordance with the thickness of the SiO₂ layer formed on the side walls of pattern 92 and the diffusion conditions. As a result, the base resistance is reduced, and the high speed operation characteristics of the transistor are improved. In addition, breakdown of the collector base junction due to electrode penetration in the metal wiring can be prevented. In a conventional device, since a base electrode of an aluminum based metal is formed in contact with the external base region, metal migration causes junction breakdown. In this example, however, since polysilicon electrode pattern 100 is formed beween base electrode wiring pattern 111 and external base region 108, both of which are formed of polysilicon, metal migration to the epitaxial layer can be prevented. Since the dimensions of the emitter region can be reduced to the resolution limit, the high speed characteristics of the transistor device are improved. This is because when the base electrode has a structure as described above, emitter electrode pattern 92 of a polycide is formed on a field oxide layer which has a contact region with the metal wiring pattern not associated with the junction capacity. In the above example, the method of forming an active base region can be modified as follows. According to one modification, in the process shown in Fig. 7F, after polysilicon layer 89 is formed, boron ions are injected into corresponding regions through layer 89 to form active base regions 87, 88₁ and 88₂. With this method, a thin diffusion film can be easily formed by adjusting the thickness of polysilicon layer 89, and layer 89 serves as a buffer layer for lessening damage upon ion implantation. Therefore, the diffusion depth of active base regions 87, 88₁ and 88₂ can be controlled to be shallow with high precision. According to a second modification, not only arsenic but also boron is doped in a polycide layer used as a diffusion source for forming N type emitter region 107 for the NPN transistor, and N type collector regions 109₁ and 109₂ for the I²L element. Thus, when the emitter of the vertical NPN transistor and the collector regions for the I²L element are formed, boron is diffused to form the active base region. Although only the active base can be performed by this method, this method can be combined with a method of forming an active base region as in the example described above. In this case, the diffusion profile of the transistor is different from that in the above example. Fig. 10A shows the impurity concentration profile when an active base region is formed in advance and only arsenic from the polycide pattern is diffused into the base region. Fig. 10B shows the impurity concentration profile when an active base region is formed in advance and arsenic and boron are both diffused from a polycide pattern into the base region. Fig. 10C shows the impurity concentation profile when an active base region is not formed in advance, and arsenic and boron are diffused into an active base region fabricating region from a polycide pattern. The method according to the profile in Fig. 10A provides good controllability of the diffusion profile. However, this method does not allow formation of a very shallow base junction, e.g., an active base region of 0.2 µm or less. With the method according to the profile in Fig. 10B, control of the diffusion profile, i.e., control of the dose of the impurity injected into a polycide layer, is difficuit. However, a very shallow base region can be formed in order to achieve high speed operation characteristics. With the method according to the profile in Fig. 10C, while the impurity profile is maintained in an ideal condition from a preformed active base region, boron is diffused into the base region from a polycide layer. Therefore, the profile of double diffusion near the surface of the base region is stable. When diffusion of arsenic is controlled, the penetration of emitter diffusion through the base diffusion region can be prevented. Accordingly, which one of the three methods for forming an active region is to be adopted is selected in accordance with the required characteristics of the semiconductor device to be fabricated. As a modification of the example shown in Figs. 7A to 7K, the processes up to element isolation Figs. 7A to 7D can be replaced with the following method. More specifically, instead of forming isolated N type buried regions 72₁ and 72₂ in a surface region of a substrate, N type buried region 72 is formed in the entire surface of a substrate Fig. 11 . Next, N type epitaxial silicon layer 73 is formed on the surface of the substrate. Thereafter, a trench for isolating the vertical NPN transistor fabricating region and the I²L element fabricating region is formed in the substrate to be deeper than region 72 . Region 72 is thus isolated into the vertical NPN transistor fabricating region and the I²L element fabricating region. Boron is then doped into the substrate from the bottom of the trench to form P type diffusion isolation layer 76. Thereafter, a thin thermal oxide layer is formed on the wall surfaces of the trench and polysilicon layer 82 is buried therein. Field oxide layer 82 and oxide isolation layers 83 and 83 are formed in the substrate by selective diffusion, as in the earlier examples. A method of manufacturing a bipolar semiconductor device according to another example will be described with reference to Figs. 12A to 12F. In the process for obtaining a semiconductor structure shown in Fig. 12A, an N type impurity e.g., Sb is selectively diffused into P type silicon substrate 121 from its surface, to form N type buried region 122₁ for the vertical NPN transistor and N type buried region 122₂ for the I²L element. Thereafter, N type epitaxial layer 123 is grown on the entire surface of the substrate including buried regions 122₁ and 122₂. A P type impurity such as boron is selectively diffused into layer 123 so as to form P type isolation layers 124 for isolating the NPN transistor and I²L element. An N type impurity such as phosphorus is selectively diffused in layer 123 so as to form an N type diffusion region reaching region 122₁, i.e., collector contact region 125 of the NPN transistor, and an N type diffusion region reaching region 122₂, i.e., a common emitter contact region of the I²L element. In the process for obtaining the semiconductor structure shown in Fig. 12B, field oxide layers 126 reaching regions 122₁ and 122₂ are formed in epitaxial layer 123 by selective diffusion. Field oxide layers 126 isolate circuit elements such as the NPN transistors and the I²L elements. Oxide isolation layer 127₁ for providing an NPN transistor of a sidewall base contact structure and oxide isolation layer 127₂ for isolating two inverter transistors of the I²L element are formed in layer 123. Isolation layers 126 and 127₁ and 127₂ can be formed simultaneously as illustrated, or separately. Thin thermal oxide layer 128 having a thickness of 50 100 n m 500 to 1000 Å is formed on the surface of layer 123. Layer 128 is selectively etched so as to form windows 129 for emitter diffusion and for removing the oxide layer portion in the collector region forming area of the I²L element. In order to form a vertical NPN transistor of side wall contact structure, emitter diffusion window 129 is formed to reach field oxide layer 126. In order to form an inverter transistor of sidewall base contact structure in the I²L element, collector diffusion windows are formed extending to oxide layers 126 and 127₂. In the process for obtaining the semiconductor structure shown in Fig. 12C, undoped polysilicon layer 130 having a thickness of 50 200 n m 500 to 2000 Å is deposited on the entire surface of the resultant structure shown in Fig. 12B by the CVD method. Arsenic is then doped in layer 130 as an impurity by ion implantation. The impurity can be phosphorus or phosphorus and arsenic. Refractory metal silicide layer 131 having a thickness of 100 300 n m 1000 to 3000 Å is deposited on the entire surface of layer 130. Boron is doped in layer 131 as an impurity by ion implantation. In this case, ion implantation for the vertical NPN transistor fabricating area and for the I²L element fabricating area is performed separately to provide desired doses for the respective areas. If required, SiO₂ layer 200 having a thickness of 200 n m 2000 Å is formed on the entire surface of doped silicide layer 131. In order to provide a uniform impurity profile, SiO₂ layer 200 is annealed at 800 to 900 C. A laminated layer of SiO₂ layer 200 and the polycide layer is patterned by selective etching. Thus, emitter electrode pattern 132 for the NPN transistor, and collector electrode patterns 133₁ and 133₂ and input wiring pattern 134 for the I²L element are formed in the substrate, as shown in Fig. 12D. Jumper wiring patterns 135₁ and 135₂ and mask pattern 136₁ for forming an injector region are then formed. In Fig. 12D, in the inverter transistor fabricating area of the I²L element, collector electrode patterns 133₁ and 133₂ are not formed to extend on the buried oxide films. With this arrangement, the collector electrodes contact with the metal wiring layers at two sides of the collector electrodes and the base resistance is reduced. However, in a direction perpendicular to the section of the drawing, collector electrode patterns 133₁ and 133₂ extend on the buried oxide films in order to provide a sidewall emitter contact structure, as in the case of a vertical NPN transistor fabricating area. In the process for obtaining the semiconductor structure shown in Fig. 12E, boron ions are injected into the epitaxial layer using polycide patterns 132, 133₁, 133₂, 134, 135₁, 135₂, and 136 and buried oxide films 126, 127₁, and 127₂ as a mask. Thereafter, P type external base region 137 for the NPN transistor and P type external base regions 138₁ and 138₂ and P type injector region 139 for the I²L element are formed in the epitaxial layer. In the process for obtaining the semiconductor structure shown in Fig. 12F, boron and arsenic are thermally diffused into corresponding regions using polycide emitter electrode 132 and collector electrodes 133₁ and 133₂ as a diffusion source. After this diffusion process, P type active base region 140 for the NPN transistor and active base regions 141₁ and 141₂ for the I²L element are formed in the epitaxial regions, and N type emitter region 142 for the NPN transistor and N type collector regions 143₁ and 143₂ for the I²L element are formed in corresponding regions 140, 141₁ and 141₂. SiO₂ layer 200 is removed, and another SiO₂ layer 144 is formed as an interlayer insulator on the surface of the semiconductor structure. Contact holes are selectively formed in insulator 144. An aluminum based layer is then formed on the entire surface of the insulator, and patterned to form electrode wiring patterns 145 to 149. Wiring patterns 145, 146 and 147 are emitter, base and collector terminals of the NPN transistor, respectively. Wiring pattern 148 is an injector terminal of the I²L element, and wiring pattern 149 is a common input wiring pattern thereof. Fig. 13 shows a section of the structure shown in Fig. 12F along a line 13 13 therein two adjacent I²L elements. In the above example for each of the vertical NPN transistors and the I²L elements, an isoplanar II structure having a normal double diffusion profile near the buried oxide films can be obtained. In the process shown in Fig. 12B, when the diffusion window is formed, even if the edges of the field oxide layer and the oxide isolation layers are etched back, this does not adversely influence the device characteristics. For example, in the vertical NPN transistor, both P type active base region 140 and N type emitter region 142 are formed by diffusion of an impurity from emitter electrode pattern 131. Therefore, the diffusion profile near the end face of field oxide layer 126 is the same as in the remaining portion. For this reason, local variations in gain or short circuiting of the emitter collector are not caused. Since the inverter transistor of the I²L element also has an isoplanar structure, it provides the same effect as that of the vertical NPN transistor. In addition, in the I²L element, the polycide pattern used as a diffusion source can then be used as wiring, thereby allowing versatile design and improving the operation speed of the inverter transistor of the I²L element. A method of manufacturing a semiconductor according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 14A and 14B. A semiconductor structure shown in Fig. 12A is obtained. Thereafter, the structure is selectively oxidized to form field oxide layer 126 and oxide isolation layers 127₁ and 127₂, as shown in Fig. 14A. Thermal oxide layer 128 is also formed in the element fabricating regions. Boron ions are injected into the epitaxial layer using field oxide layer 126 and oxide isolation layers 127₁ and 127₂ as a mask. Thus, active base region 140 for the vertical NPN transistor and active base regions 141 ₁ and 141 ₂ for the I²L element are formed in the epitaxial layer. Selective etching is then performed to form emitter diffusion window 129 in thermal oxide layer 128 covering the active base region of the NPN transistor, and to remove the thermal oxide layer on the collector forming region of the I²L element. Thereafter, manufacturing is performed in accordance with the processes from Figs. 12C to 12E, and a semiconductor device as shown in Fig. 14B is obtained. In the manufacturing method described above, since active base regions 141 ₁ and 141 ₂ are formed in the epitaxial layer by ion implantation in advance, the diffusion profile of the ion implanted regions is different from that shown in Fig. 12F. As shown in Fig. 15, the diffusion profile of the vertical NPN transistor in which boron is doped becomes P₀, while that of the transistor in which the boron diffusion is performed from the emitter electrode of a polycide becomes P₁. Thus, the vertical transistor of the semiconductor device shown in Fig. 14B has two profiles P₀ and P₁. With such profiles, since profile P₀ is corrected by profile P₁, an appropriate base width can be maintained near the field oxide layer. A uniform gain can thus be obtained, and short circuiting between the emitter and base can be prevented.
