# Composite rivet.

## Abstract
A composite rivet 10 comprises a performed head portion 12 , a shear portion 14 , an integral mandrel 18 extending from said shear portion 14 having an annular recess 17 therein, a deformable plastic locking ring 16 radially aligned with and filling the recess 17 in said mandrel 18 , and a collar 34 telescoped about and radially aligned with said locking ring 16 for controlling deformation thereof.

## Claims
1. A composite rivet comprising a head portion, a shear portion, an integral mandrel extending from said shear portion having an annular recess therein, and a deformable plastic collar comprising chopped randomly orientated fibers encapsulated by a sheath of circumferentially extending con tinuous fibers set in a thermoplastic matrix radially aligned with and filling the recess in said mandrel.

## Description
The rivet of the instant invention is an improvement on the composite rivet disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 4,478,544 issued October 23, 1984, for Composite Rivet, and assigned to the assignee hereof. Carbon fiber reinforced materials are widely used in the aircraft industry for airframe structural components. However, the use of carbon fiber rein forced resins in rivets has heretofore been limited by the difficulty of efficiently forming the rivet heads. The aforesaid problem is solved by providing the rivet with an integral mandrel on the back side thereof that is tensioned relative to a workpiece. Compression of a collar, comprising a chopped fiber core with a woven fiber sheath set in a resin matrix, into an annular groove of the rivet is accomplished by a suitable tool and is enabled by the use of a ther moplastic or B stage thermoset resin matrix, which is softened due to the application of heat. The collar, in combination with a radially extending rivet head on the opposite end of the rivet, forms a riveted connec tion that exhibits relatively high shear and tension strength. As best seen in Fig. 1 of the drawings, a rivet 10 in accordance with a constructed embodiment of the instant invention comprises a thermoset resin rivet body 11 having a preformed head portion 12, a shear portion 14, a locking portion 16 having an annular groove 17 therein, and an integral mandrel 18. The mandrel 18 facilitates tensioning of the rivet 10. The shear portion 14 of the rivet body 11 extends through complementary apertures 20 and 22 in a pair of work pieces 24 and 26, respectively. The rivet body 11 is reinforced internally by parallel carbon fibers 30 and externally by a woven or braided fiber sheath 31 on the outer periphery thereof. As seen by comparing Fig. 1 with Fig. 2 of the drawings, the mandrel 18 of the rivet body 11 is adapted to be pulled upwardly by a tool not shown of conventional design while a tool 32 is concomitantly biased downwardly against a collar 34. The collar 34 has a sheath 36 comprising woven, braided, or circum ferentially directed fibers disposed about chopped fibers 38 and set in thermoplastic or B stage ther moset resin matrix. Downward pressure of the tool 32 results in deformation of the collar 34 into the con figuration shown in Fig. 2, thereby filling the groove 17 in the locking portion 16 of the rivet body 11. In accordance with one feature of the instant invention, only the thermoplastic or B stage resin matrix of the collar 34 need be softened by the appli cation of heat by, for example, direct heating or pre heat of the tool 32. A relatively smooth exterior surface is deve loped on the collar 34 due to the sheath 36 thereof. Clamp up force of the rivet 10 on the workpieces 24 and 26, in conjunction with the head 12 of the rivet 10, is maintained by the inwardly convergent configuration of the groove 17 in the preform 11. The embodiments of Figs. 3 6 are similar to the rivet of Figs. 1 and 2 except for the cross sectional configuration of the annular groove 17 in the locking portion 16 of the rivet body 11. In each case, the collar 34 is deformed into the groove 17 to achieve and maintain clamp up of the workpieces 24 and 26. Moreover, it is to be noted that, in each embodiment, the sheath 36 on the collar 34 extends into engagement with the sheath 31 on the rivet body 11 to preclude protrusion of the fibers 38 of the collar 34.
