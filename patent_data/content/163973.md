# Blast furnace tuyere with replaceable liner.

## Abstract
A replaceable liner assembly for a blast furnace tuyere comprises a tubular, metallic liner which fits within the tuyere and a plurality of layers of refractory fibre paper sandwiched between the tubular liner and the inside surface of the tuyere. There are gas tight seals between the liner and the tuyere at opposite ends thereof to prevent gas from entering the space occupied by the refractory fibre paper. The liner is composed of a metal which has a good resistance to oxidation and a lower thermal conductance and higher melting point than the metal of which the tuyere is composed.
