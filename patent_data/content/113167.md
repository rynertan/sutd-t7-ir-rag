# LASER IMAGING MATERIALS

## Abstract
The laser imaging material comprises a laser trans parent support layer 10 of, for example, polyester. A first overlying layer 20 is laser transparent and formed from a thermally decomposable binder of, for example, an acrylic or methacrylic homopolymer or copolymer, a cellulosic polym er, or a homopolymer or copolymer of styrene. A second overlying layer 30 is formed from a thermally decomposable binder of polymeric material, the same as or different from that of the first overlying layer, pigmented with carbon black. Upon laser irradiation through the support layer 10, selected portions of the carbon black are transferred to a suitable receptor surface such as paper of a lithographic plate.
