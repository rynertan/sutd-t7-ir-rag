# Semiconductor charge transfer devices.

## Abstract
A semiconductor charge transfer device, e.g. a CCD area imaging array, having a multi level polysilicon gate structure 20 22, 24, 25, 26 the geometry of the bus line portions 24, 25, 26 of which are such that each bus line has relatively large area regions where it does not overlap another polysili con layer. The making of interconnections 24b, 25b, 26b be tween the polysilicon bus lines and an overlying metal con ductor pattern 24a, 25a, 26a without producing inter level short circuits via pinholes in the polysilicon is thus facilitated.
