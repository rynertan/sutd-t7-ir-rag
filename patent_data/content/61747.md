# An apparatus for manufacturing bulbs.

## Abstract
An apparatus for manufacturing bulbs comprises a mount holder 18 having a hole 22 through which an exhaust tube 104 is passed loosely and holding a mount 101 , a sealing burner 32 arranged around the holder for fusing the contact portions of a stem 102 and the opening edge of a bulb body 108 , a butting plate 36 arranged around the holder so as to be able to reciprocate along the axis of the holder, and capable of pressing on the fused contact portions, and two tipping off burners 50, 51 for tipping off the exhaust tube. The holder includes two flame inlet ports 46, 47 opening in the outer surface of the holder and communicating with the hole. The burners are located outside the holder, and can move between a position where it can inject flames into the ports and a position where it does not prevent the movement of the butting plate.
