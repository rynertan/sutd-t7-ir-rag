## Description
This invention relates to a light sensitive photographic material, particularly to a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material. In recent years, it has been particularly desired for enhancement of image quality to improve sensitivity, graininess, sharpness and color reproducibility of a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material hereinafter sometimes written as color light sensitive material . However, if the sizes of silver halide grains are made greater for making sensitivity higher, graininess will be worsened. Besides, if the amounts of coupler and silver halide are increased for elevation of sensitivity, the film thickness of the emulsion layer will consequently be increased, whereby sharpness is lowered. Accordingly, it is generally difficult to satisfy both the demand for making sensitivity higher and the demand for graininess and sharpness, and the prior art techniques have failed to improve fully the image quality by way of changing the manner in which the basic constituent materials of color light sensitive material such as coupler and silver halide are used. On the other hand, as a means for improving graininess and sharpness, it has been known to use a diffusible DI releasing coupler capable of releasing a diffusible development inhibitor hereinafter called diffusible DIR coupler as disclosed in, for example, Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 131934 1984. However, as can be seen from the prior art, only use of a diffusible DIR coupler in combination with the so called protect type coupler dispersed as oil droplets involves the following problem, although sharpness may be improved to some extent. That is, since the development inhibiting substance diffused from the layer containing a diffusible DIR coupler into other layers with different color sensitivities inhibits excessively development in other layers, disadvantages in aspect of color reproduction become increased such as marked loss of color balance of the image particularly when the other layers are adjacent low density layers. This is because of excessive occurence of development called as inter image effect, and it has been desired to suppress such an inter image effect. In general it is known from EP A 0 114 674 and EP A 0 107 112 that couplers can be incorporated into silver halide emulsion layers containing a DIR compound as dispersion in oil droplets or dissolved in alkaline aqueous solutions. In these documents, however, there is no incentive that a first coupler should be dispersed in oil droplets and a second coupler should be dispersed in an alkali aqueous solution in one and the same light sensitive photographic material. An object of the present invention is to provide a light sensitive photographic material which is high in sensitivity and can improve markedly graininess and color reproducibility, while improving also sharpness. More specifically, the present invention concerns a light sensitive photographic material comprising a silver halide emulsion layer containing a first coupler dispersed in oil droplets and a compound capable of releasing a diffusible development inhibiting substance or a precursor thereof, which is characterized in that said silver halide emulsion layer additionally contains a second coupler dispersed in an alkali aqueous solution. According to the present invention, it has been found that the object of the present invention can be fully realized by combination of the first and the second couplers as mentioned above which are to be dispersed according to different methods. In this case, the first coupler dispersed as oil droplets has lipophilic groups and soluble in a high boiling point organic solvent an alkali soluble group is not essential . On the other hand, the second coupler dispersed as an aqueous alkali solution has at least one acidic group such as sulfonic acid group or carboxylic group, the coupler itself and the color forming dye being preferably those which will not be diffused through a hydrophilic colloid in this case, as a group which prevents diffusion, at least one organic group with 8 or more carbon atoms is permitted to exist at the non active point, namely the site where it will not be eliminated through the coupling reaction . And, in the emulsion layer containing the first coupler and the second coupler, the second coupler exsists in a state dispersed as the alkali soluble type, whereby it may be considered that the developing initial reaction is rapid to improve markedly graininess. The second coupler should desirably be contained in an amount of 50 mole or less based on the total amount of the couplers, because not only graininess but also sharpness can be excellently maintained thereby. The proportion of the second coupler may further preferably be 30 mole or less, particularly 10 mole or less based on the total amount of the first and second couplers. The first coupler may be added to a conventional high boiling point organic solvent droplet type, and an alkali solution of the second coupler can be added before or after preparation of the droplet. The present inventors have further investigated about the combined use of the first coupler and the second coupler which can bring about the marked effect as mentioned above. As a consequence, it has been found that sharpness is still insufficient, although graininess can be fully improved by combined use of the both couplers. However, it has been found that sharpness can be also fully improved simultaneously with prevention of loss of color balance through the excessive overlaying effect as already described by addition of a diffusible DIR coupler or diffusible DIR compound to the combined coupler system. Such prevention of excessive overlaying effect may be considered to be due to reduced release of diffusible DI through the reaction of a diffusible DIR compound and the oxidized product of a developing agent on account of rapid reaction of the second coupler of the aqueous alkali solution dispersed type of the above both couplers with the oxidized product of a developing agent during development. The light sensitive silver halide photographic material of the present invention can be, for example, negative and positive films of color negative, and also color printing papers, and the light sensitive materials may be for either monochromatic or multi color uses. In the case of light sensitive silver halide photographic materials for multi color, in order to effect the detractive color reproduction, they have structures in which silver halide emulsion layers containing respective couplers of magenta, yellow and cyan as couplers for photography and non light sensitive layers laminated on a support in desired layer number and layer order, and said layer number and layer order may be changed as desired depending on the important performance and the purpose of use.

Specific examples of preferred first couplers are shown below. Specific examples of preferred second couplers are shown below. Of the couplers to be used in the present invention, the first coupler should desirably be slow particularly in the developing initial reaction, while the second coupler rapid particularly in the developing initial reaction. As the first coupler slow in the developing initial reaction, a 4 equivalent type coupler highly compatible with a high boiling solvent may be preferred, with its color density being 0.01 or lower when measured according to the method as hereinafter described, preferably entirely without color formation during 10 development. Such first couplers slow in developing initial reaction may include the exemplary couplers y 1, y 2, m 5, m 6, c 4 and c 5. On the other hand, the second coupler rapid in developing initial reaction may be a coupler having a color density of 0.03 or more, preferably 0.07 or more, when measured according to the method as hereinafter described. More specifically, there may be included the exemplary couplers Y 1, Y 2, Y 3, M 1, M 2, M 3, M 4, C 1 and C 2, which are not limitative of the present invention. The method for measurement of the developing initial reaction is described below. First, an emulsion comprising 0.01 mole 0.02 mole in the case of a divalent coupler of a coupler added to 1 mole of a high sensitivity silver iodobromide 4 mole of silver iodide mean grain size 0.9 µm was coated onto a cellulose triacetate base to an amount of silver coated of 1.6 g m² and a gelatin amount of 1.6 g m², followed by drying. The photographic film piece obtained is subjected to exposure of 1.6 cd ms CMS , and then the following processings are conducted processing temperature 38 During color developoing, the film piece is stationarily immersed. The compositions of the processing solutions to be used for respective steps are shown below. The density of the piece obtained is measured. As the method for dispersing each of the first coupler and the second coupler, known methods can be employed. For carrying out oil droplet dispersion of the first coupler, the methods as described in Japanese Provisional Patent Publications Nos. 102234 1984, 105645 1984 and 109055 1984 may be applicable. For example, a silver halide emulsion to be used in the present invention can be prepared by dissolving a coupler in a high boiling point organic solvent such as phthalic acid esters e.g. dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, , phosphoric acid esters tricresyl phosphate, trioctyl phosphate , N substituted acid amides N,N diethyllaurylamide , alone or in a mixture with a low boiling point organic solvent, typically methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate, butyl propionate, cyclohexanol, cyclohexane, tetrahydrofuran, methyl alcohol, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dioxane, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, diethylene glycol monoacetate, acetylacetone, nitromethane, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, then mixing with an aqueous gelatin solution containing a surfactant and subsequently emulsifying the mixture by means of a dispersing means such as a stirrer, a homogenizer, a colloid mill, a flow jet mixer, an ultrasonic dispersing means, followed by addition of the emulsion into a silver halide emulsion. It is also possible to incorporate the step of removing the low boiling point solvent after or simultaneously with dispersion. Here, the ratio of the high boiling point organic solvent to the low boiling point organic solvent may preferably 1 0.1 to 1 50, more preferably 1 1 to 1 20. As the oil droplet dispersing aid in this case, surfactants as described in Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 105645 1984 may be used. Such surfactants may include, for example, anionic surfactants such as alkylbenzene sulfonates, alkylnaphthalene sulfonates, alkylsulfonates, alkylsulates, alkylphosphates, sulfosuccinates and sulfoalkylpolyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ethers nonionic surfactants such as steroid type saponins, alkylene oxide derivatives and glycidol derivatives amphoteric surfactants such as amino acids, aminoalkyl sulfonic acids and alkyl betains, and cationic surfactants such as quaternary ammonium salts. Examples of these surfactants are described in Handbook of Surfactants published by Sangyo Tosho, 1966 or Studies of Emulsifiers and Emulsifying Devices Technical Data Systems published by Kagaku Hanron Co., 1978 . On the other hand, for carrying out an aqueous alkali dispersion of the second coupler, there may be employed the method as described in Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 60437 1984. In this case, since the coupler has an acid group such as carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid, it may be introduced into a hydrophilic colloid as an alkaline aqueous solution. The amount of the coupler added may desirably be such that the total amount of the couplers may be 0.017 mole or more per one mole of the silver halide. Next, the diffusible DIR coupler to be used in the present invention is to be described. For enhancing the sharpness at the low frequency region, namely the MTF value particularly 1.15 or higher , it is desirable that a developing inhibiting substance with a diffusion degree as described hereinafter of 0.4 or higher should be released or eliminated directly or indirectly from the coupler through the coupling reaction. The diffusion degree of the developing inhibiting substance is measured according to the method described below. First, respective layers with the following compositions are successivly provided on a transparent support to prepare Sample I. Red sensitivity is imparted with the use of 6 x 10 ⁵ mole of the sensitizing dye I as hereinafter described to a silver iodobromide emulsion silver iodide 5 mole , mean size 0.4 µm , and the gelatin coating solution containing the emulsion and 0.0015 mole of the coupler A shown below per mole of silver was coated to a silver quantity of 1.8 g m² film thickness 2 µm . A gelatin layer silver quantity 2 g m², film thickness 1.5 µm containing the silver iodobromide emulsion before sensitization used in the first layer and polymethyl methacrylate particles diameter 1.5 µm . Further, in each layer, a gelatin hardening agent and a surfactant are contained. Sample II is prepared in the same manner as Sample I except for omitting the silver iodobromide in the second layer. After wedge exposure of the both samples, the following development processing is performed. The diffusibility of the development inhibiting substance is determined based on the concentration reduction of Sample I. That is, when the concentration reduction of Sample I is defined as Δn The diffusion degrees of some development inhibiting substances are exemplified below. The DIR coupler capable of eliminating the development inhibiting substance with a diffusion degree of 0.4 or higher is represented by the following formula IX In the above formula, A represents a coupler component and Y is a development inhibitor or a group containing it which is bonded at the coupling position of A, and Here, A may be one which can be coupled with the oxidized product of a color developing agent, irrespectively of whether it may form a dye as the result of the coupling reaction.

The above DIR couplers can be synthesized easily according to the methods as disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 4,234,678, No. 3,227,554, No. 3,617,291, No. 3,958,993, No. 4,149,886 and No. 3,933,500 Japanese Provisional Patent Publications No. 56837 1982 and No. 13239 1976 U.K. Patents No. 2,072,363 and No. 2,070,266 Research Disclosure No. 21228, December, 1981. In the present invention, the amount of the diffusible DIR coupler added may preferably be 0.01 to 50 mole relative to silver, particularly 1 to 5 mole . In the silver halide emulsion to be used in the light sensitive silver halide photographic material of the present invention, there may be employed any of silver halides conventionally used in silver halide emulsions such as silver bromide, silver iodobromide, silver iodochloride, silver chlorobromide and silver chloride, etc. The silver halide grains to be used in the light sensitive photographic material of the present invention may be one obtained by either one of the acidic method, the neutral method or the ammoniac method. Said grains may be grown at one time or grown after preparation of seed grains. The method for preparation of seed grains and the method for growth may be either the same or different. The silver halide emulsion may be made either by mixing simultaneously halogen ions and silver ions or by mixing either one of them into the other. Also, while considering the critical growth speed of silver halide crystals, it may be formed by adding halide ions and silver ions successively at the same time while controlling pH and pAg in the mixing vessel. After growth, the halogen composition of the grains may be changed by use of the conversion method. In preparation of the photographic material of the present invention, by use of a silver halide solvent if desired, the grains size, the grain shape, the grain size distribution and the grain growth speed of the silver halide grains can be controlled. The silver halide grains to be used in the photographic material of the present invention can be added with metal ions by use of cadmium salts, zinc salts, lead salts, thallium salts, iridium salts or complexes, rhodium salts or complexes, iron salts or complexes to include them internally within and or on the surfaces of the grains, or may be placed in an appropriate reducing atmosphere thereby to impart reducing sensitizing nuclei to the grains internally therein and or on the surfaces thereof. In the silver halide emulsion for preparing the photographic material of the present invention, unnecessary soluble salts may be eliminated or contained as such after completion of the growth of the silver halide grains. When said salts are to be removed, it can be practiced on the basis of the method as disclosed in Research Disclosure No. 17643. The silver halide grains to be used in the photographic material of the present invention may consist of uniform layers of the inner portion and the surface or alternatively different layers. The silver halide grains to be used in the photographic material of the present invention may be grains of the type in which latent images are formed primarily on the surfaces, or of the type in which they are formed primarily within the inner portions of the grains. The silver halide grains to be used in the photographic material of the present invention may have regular crystal forms or irregular crystal forms such as spheres or plates. In these grains, the proportion of 1,0,0 plane to 1,1,1 plane may be any desired value. Also, these crystal forms may have a complex form, in which grains of various crystal forms may be mixed. The silver halide emulsion for preparing the photographic material of the present invention may be used by mixing two or more kinds of silver halide emulsions formed separately. It is preferred to use monodispersed silver halide grains. In this connection, the monodispersed silver halide grains mean grains in which a weight of the silver halide grains each having an average diameter The grain diameter referred to herein means a diameter of each grain when the silver halide grain is spherical, and a diameter obtained by converting a projected image of each grain into a circular image having the same area when it is not spherical. The grain diameter can be determined, for example, by enlarging each grain 10,000 fold to 50,000 fold with the aid of an electron microscope, photographing it, and measuring a diameter of the grain or an area of its projected image on the resultant print. The grains to be measured are selected at random as many as 1,000 or more. A layer containing such a monodispersed silver halide emulsion may contain other monodispersed or polydispersed emulsion than the above. For example, it means that the grains a grain diameter distribution curve of which has a plurality of modes can be included in this invention. The substantially monodispersed means that inclusive of such grains as mentioned above, a weight of the silver halide grains having the diameter of the above defined The monodispersed silver halide grains and the first coupler and the second coupler are desirably contained in at least one of the emulsion layers of the light sensitive photographic material having at least one silver halide emulsion layer. The silver halide grains to be used in the photographic material of present invention may be so called twinned crystal which has irregular shape such as plate like shaped, and also may be regulated shape such as cubic, octahedral or tetradecahedral sperical shaped, but preferably octahedral or tetradecahedral. Said silver halide grains may be so called core shell type which has different photographic performances or silver halide compositions between a core portion and a shell portion. The silver halide emulsion for preparing the photographic material of the present invention can be chemically sensitized in a conventional manner. That is, it is possible to use the sulfur sensitization method employing a sulfur compound capable of reacting with silver ions or active gelatin, the selenium sensitization method employing a selenium compound, the reducing sensitization method employing a reducible substance and the noble metal sensitization employing gold or other noble metal compounds, either singly or in combination. The silver halide emulsion for preparing the photographic material of the present invention can be sensitized optically to a desired wavelength region by use of dyes known as sensitizing dyes in the field of photography. The sensitizing dye may be used either singly or in combination of two or more compounds. It is also possible to incorporate in the emulsion a potentiating sensitizer which is a dye having itself no spectral sensitizing action or a compound which does not substantially asbsorp visible light, but can strengthen the sensitizing action of a sensitizing dye. The silver halide emulsion for preparing the photographic material of the present invention, compounds known as antifoggants or stabilizers in the field of photography may be added in the steps for preparation of light sensitive materials, during storage or during chemical aging for the purpose of preventing fogging during photographic processings and or maintaining photographic performances stably, and or on and or after completion of chemical aging or before coating of the silver halide emulsion. As the binder or protective colloid for the silver halide emulsion for preparing the photographic material of the present invention, gelatin may be advantageously used. Otherwise, hydrophilic colloids such as gelatin derivatives, graft polymers of gelatin and other polymer, proteins, cellulose derivatives, synthetic hydrophilic polymeric materials such as homo or co polymers can also be used. The photographic emulsion layer or other hydrophilic colloid layers in the light sensitive photographic material of the present invention is hardened by crosslinking the binder or protective colloid molecules and using singly or in combination with film hardening agents for enhancing film strength. The film hardening agent should desirably be added in an amount capable of hardening the light sensitive material to the extent of requiring no addition of a film hardening agent into processing solutions, but it is also possible to add a film hardening agent in a processing solution. For the purpose of enhancing flexibility of the silver halide emulsion layer and or other hydrophilic layers in the light sensitive photographic material of the present invention, a plasticizer may be added. For the purpose of improving dimensional stability of the photographic emulsion layer or other hydrophilic colloid layers in the light sensitive photographic material of the present invention, a dispersion of a water insoluble or sparingly soluble synthetic polymer latex may be contained therein. In the emulsion layer of the light sensitive silver halide color photographic material of the present invention, in the color forming development processing, there is employed a dye forming coupler capable of forming a dye through the coupling reaction with the oxidized product of an aromatic primary amine developer e.g. p phenylenediamine derivative, aminophenol derivative . Said dye forming coupler is commonly selected so that a dye capable of absorbing the light sensitive spectral light in the emulsion layer may be formed for each emulsion layer, and a yellow dye forming coupler is used in the blue sensitive emulsion layer, a magenta dye forming coupler in the green sensitive emulsion layer and a cyan dye forming coupler in the red sensitive emulsion layer. However, depending on the purpose, a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material may be prepared in a manner different from the above combination. For prevention of color turbidity through migration of the oxidized product of the developing agent or the electron transfer agent between the emulsion layers in the light sensitive color photographic material of the present invention between the layers of the same color sensitive layers and or different color sensitive layers , deterioration of sharpness and markedness of graininess, a color antifoggant may be used. Said color antifoggant may be used in the emulsion layer itself, or in an intermediate layer provided between adjacent emulsion layers. In the color photographic light sensitive material of the present invention, an image stabilizer for preventing deterioration of dye image can be used. It is also possible to incorporate a UV absorber for prevention of fogging and deterioration of images by UV ray due to discharging caused by charging of the hydrophilic colloid layers such as protective layer, intermediate layer in the light sensitive photographic material of the present invention. In the color photographic light sensitive material of the present invention, there may also be provided auxiliary layers such as filter layer, halation preventive layer and or irradiation preventive layer, etc. In these layers and or emulsion layers, dyes which are flowed out from the color light sensitive material or bleached during development processing may be contained. For the purpose of enhancing writability to reduce the luster of the light sensitive material or prevention of sticking between the light sensitive materials, a matting agent may be added in the silver halide emulsion layers and or other hydrophilic colloid layers used in the light sensitive silver halide photographic material of the present invention. A lubricant may also be added for the purpose of reducing the slide friction of the light sensitive photographic material of the present invention. In the light sensitive photoraphic material of the present invention, there may be added an antistatic agent for prevention of charging. The antistatic agent may be used in the charge prevention layer on the side of the support where no emulsion is laminated or alternatively in the emulsion layer and or the protective colloid layer other than emulsion layers on the side where emulsion layers are laminated relative to the support. In the photographic emulsion layer and or other hydrophilic coloid layers of the light sensitive photographic material of the present invention, various surfactants may be used for the purpose of improvement of coating characteristic, prevention of charging, improvement of slidability, emulsification, prevention of adhesion and improvement of photographic characteristics promotion of development, hardening of tone, sensitization . In the light sensitive photographic material of the present invention, the photographic emulsion layer or other layers may be coated onto a flexible reflective support such as a paper having baryta layer or α olefin polymer laminated thereon, or a synthetic paper, a film comprising a semi synthetic or synthetic polymer such as cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, polyamide or a rigid material such as glass, metal, earthenware. The silver halide emulsion may be applied directly on the support surface, after application of corona discharging, UV ray irradiation or flame treatment, if desired, or through an intermediary one or more subbing layer for improvement of adhesiveness, charging prevention, dimensional stability, abrasion resistance, hardness, halation prevention, frictional characteristic and or other characteristics . The light sensitive photographic material of the present invention can be exposed by use of an electromagnetic wave in the spectral region to which the emulsion layer constituting the light sensitive photographic material of the present invention has sensitivity. As the light source, there may be employed any of the known light sources such as natural light sunlight , tungsten lamp, fluorescent lamp, mercury lamp, xenon arc lamp, carbon arc lamp, xenon flash lamp, cathode ray tube flying spot, various laser beams, emission diode light, electron beam, X ray, light emitted from a fluorescent material excited by γ ray and α ray. The exposure time may be an exposure time from 1 ms to one s conventionally used in cameras, as a matter of course, or even shorter than 1 ms, for example, exposure for 100 µs to 1 µs. Also, exposure for longer than one seconds is possible. Said exposure may be effected either continuously or intermittently. The light sensitive silver halide photographic material of the present invention is capable of forming an image by carrying out color development known in this field of the art. The aromatic primary amine color developing agent to be used in the color developing solution includes known compounds used widely in various color photographic processes. These developing agents may include aminophenol type and p phenylenediamine type derivatives. These compounds are generally employed in the form of salts such as hydrochlorides or sulfates which are more stable than in free state. These compounds are generally employed at concentrations of 0.1 g to 30 g, preferably 1 g to 1.5 g, per one liter of the color developing solution. An aminophenol type developing solution may contain, for example, o aminophenol, p aminophenol, 5 amino 2 oxytoluene, 2 amino 3 oxytoluene and 2 oxy 3 amino 1,4 dimethylbenzene. Particularly useful primary aromatic amine type color developing agents are N,N dialkyl p phenylenediamine type compounds, and the alkyl group and the phenyl group may be substituted with any desired substituent. Among them, examples of particularly useful compounds may include N,N diethyl p phenylenediamine hydrochloride, N methyl p phenylenediamine hydrochloride, N,N dimethyl p phenylenediamine hydrochloride, 2 amino 5 N ethyl N dodecylamino toluene, N ethyl N β methanesulfonamidoethyl 3 methyl 4 aminoaniline sulfate, N ethyl N β hydroxyethylaminoaniline, 4 amino 3 methyl N,N diethylaniline and 4 amino N 2 methoxyethyl N ethyl 3 methylaniline p toluenesulfonate. In the color developing solution to be used in the processing of the photographic material of the present invention, there may further be contained, in addition to the above primary aromatic amine type color developing agent, various components generally added in color developing solutions, including alkali agents such as sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, alkali metal sulfites, alkali metal bisulfites, alkali metal thiocyanates, alkali metal halides, benzyl alcohol, water softening agents and thickeners as desired. The pH value of the color developing solution may be usually 7 or higher, most generally 10 to 13. After color developing processing, processing with a processing solution having fixing ability is carried out. When the processing solution having said fixing ability is a fixing solution, bleaching processing is carried out before the fixing processing. As the bleaching agent to be used in said bleaching step, there may be employed a metal complex of an organic acid, and said metal complex has the action of oxidizing the silver halide formed by development to silver halide simultaneously with color formation of the unformed portion of the color forming agent, with its constitution comprising an organic acid such as an aminopolycarboxylic acid or oxalic acid, citric acid, coordinated with metal ions such as iron, cobalt, copper. The most preferable organic acid to be used for formation of such a metal complex of an organic acid may include polycarboxylic acids or aminopolycarboxylic acids. These polycarboxylic acids or aminopolycarboxylic acids may be alkali metal salts, ammonium salts or water soluble amine salts. Typical examples of these may include the following compounds The bleaching solution to be used contains a metal complex of an organic acid as described above as the bleaching agent, and can also contain various additives. As the additives, it is desirable to contain particularly alkali halides or ammonium halides, for example, rehalogenating agents such as potassium bromide, sodium bromide, sodium chloride, ammonium bromide, metal salts, chelating agents. It is also possible to add conveniently those conventionally known to be added, including pH buffers such as borates, oxalates, acetates, carbonates, phosphates, alkylamines and polyethylene oxides. Further, the fixing solution and the bleach fixing solution can also contain pH buffers comprising various salts, for example, sulfites such as ammonium sulfite, potassium sulfite, ammonium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, sodium bisulfite, ammonium metabisulfite, potassium metabisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, boric acid, borax, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, acetic acid, sodium acetate, ammonium hydroxide, either singly or as a mixture of two or more compounds. The present invention is described in more detail by referring to the following Examples. For evaluation the effectiveness of the present invention, coupler emulsifiers of various types were first prepared. The second coupler was dissolved in an 1 N aqueous caustic potash solution, then added to an aqueous 10 gelatin solution and adjusted to pH 7.0 with a 1 N aqueous citric acid solution. The first coupler was dissolved in a solvent mixture of tricresyl phosphate and ethyl acetate, then mixed with an aqueous 10 gelatin solution containing Alkanol XC produced by Du Pont Co. as the surfactant, followed by emulsification in a colloid mill. Although the second coupler dispersion may be added into the mixture of the first coupler and emulsified in a colloid mill, no surfactant may be added at this time. The coupler emulsion as prepared above was added to a silver halide gelatin emulsion, and then a light sensitive sample I comprising respective layers with compositions as shown below provided by coating on a triacetate cellulose film support having a subbing layer provided thereon was prepared. For comparison, a light sensitive sample II using the first coupler alone was prepared. That is, the couplers in the above emulsion layer were changed to the following compounds The method for dispersing DIR coupler was the same as the method for dispersing the first coupler m 5. The light sensitive samples as prepared above were subjected to wedge exposure at 1.6 cd ms CMS , and then subjected to the following processings with processing solutions as previously described processing temperature 38 The density of the processed sample was measured with the use of green light. The results are shown in Table 1. The relative sensitivity is the reciprocal of the dose which gives a color formed density of fog 0.2 and calculated with the value of Sample II as 100. As is apparent from Table 1, it can be understood that the sharpness represented by MTF vague is improved by combination of the combined couplers with the diffusible DIR coupler according to the present invention. When M 11, M 6, M 12 or M 16 was employed in place of M 3, similar effects could be obtained. On a cellulose triacetate base, a multi layer light sensitive sample III comprising respective layers with compositions shown below was prepared As sample IV for comparison, in the above constitution, the second couplers C 1, M 1 and Y 2 in the third layer, the sixth layer and the ninth layer were omitted, respectively, and instead thereof the amounts of the first couplers c 4, m 5 and y 2 were increased in moles corresponding to the second couplers for sample IV , respectively. On the other hand, samples V to X were prepared with the same compositions except for changing the DIR couplers as shown in Table 2 for the combinations of the couplers and DIR couplers of samples III and IV , respectively. The light sensitive materials thus obtained were subjected to wedge exposure with white light and then developed in the same manner as in Example 1. For cyan images and magenta images of these samples, MTF values at frequency of 7 cycles mm were measured. On the other hand, for determining the overlaying effect from the red sensitive emulsion layer to the green sensitive emulsion layer, first uniform exposure was given with green light, subsequently wedge exposure was effected with red light, followed by the same developing processing as in Example 1, and the maximum and minimum magenta densities of negative were measured and the density difference between them was calculated. These results are summarized in Table 2. As is apparent from Table 2, it can be appreciated that MTF values of cyan images and magenta images are enhanced to improve sharpness by the combination of the two couplers and the diffusible DIR coupler. On the other hand, as to the inter image effect represented by the difference between the maximum and minimum magenta densities, it becomes extremely high in the sample IV and not desirable in color reproduction. An ammoniacal silver nitrate solution and an aqueous alkali halide solution were placed, by gravity drop, in a reaction vessel a temperature of which was maintained at 60 An aqueous ammoniacal silver nitrate solution and an aqueous potassium bromide solution were added in a reaction vessel in which potassium iodide and an aqueous gelatin solution had previously been put, in proportion to an increase in surface area at a grain growing period, while a pAg of a mixture in the reaction vessel were maintained at a constant value. Next, precipitation and desalting were then carried out by adding an aqueous Demol N trade name, made by Kao Atlas Co., Ltd. solution and an aqueous magnesium sulfate solution. Subsequently, gelatin was added thereto in order to prepare an emulsion having pAg 7.8 and pH 6.0. A chemical ripening was then carried out using sodium thiosulfate, chloroauric acid and ammonium thiocyanate, and 4 hydroxy 6 methyl 1,3,3a,7 tetrazaindene and 6 nitrobenzimldazole were then added thereto. Further, gelatin was added thereto, whereby monodispersed silver iodobromide emulsion was prepared. In this case, a mole value of silver iodide was varied by changing a ratio of potassium iodide to potassium bromide, a grain diameter was varied by changing amounts of the ammoniacal silver nitrate and the potassium halides. A silver iodobromide emulsion used in Example 3, which has wider grain size distribution than the monodispersed emulsion used in this invention and narrower grain size distribution than the above mentioned polydispersed emulsion was prepared by consciously varing the addition rates of the aqueous ammoniacal silver nitrate solution and aqueous potassium bromide solution, and varing the proportion to an increase in surface area at a grain growing period. A multi layer light sensitive sample XI was prepared with the same compositions as in Example 2 except for changing the silver halide and the coupler in the layers of 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 10 as shown below. In the following, mole of silver iodide, an amount of gelatin, an amount of coupler and the other additives are the same as in Example 2. Silver iodobromide polydispersed emulsion Silver iodobromide polydispersed emulsion Silver iodobromide polydispersed emulsion Silver iodobromide polydispersed emulsion Silver iodobromide polydispersed emulsion Silver iodobromide polydispersed emulsion Next, sample XII which has the same coupler and constitution as the sample XI except for changing the silver halide to monodispersed emulsion was prepared. And sample XIII for comparison was prepared, in the sample XI , the second couplers C 6, C 7, M 16, Y 21 and Y 3 in the third, fourth, sixth, seventh, ninth and tenth layers were omitted, respectively, and instead thereof the amounts of the first couplers c 7, c 11, m 16, y 9 and y 17 were increased in moles corresponding to the second couplers for sample XIII , respectively. The light sensitive materials thus obtained were subjected to wedge exposure with white light and then developed in the same manner as in Example 2, and these results are summerized in Table 3. As clearly seen from Table 3, it can be appriciated that images are improved by combination of the present constitution and the monodispersed silver halide emulsion. By the combination of the couplers and the diffusible DIR coupler , an adequate inter image effect could be obtained, whereby images preferable in color reproduction excellent in color balance could be obtained.
