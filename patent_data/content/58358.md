# Improved anion exchange chromatographic packing composition.

## Abstract
An agglomerated anion exchange chromatographic packing composition comprising Component A, a substrate which consists insoluble synthetic resin particles having cation exchanging sites at least on their available surfaces, the particles having a diameter of 5 to 75 microns and of low porosity relative to Component B microparticles, and Component B, which consists of microparticles of in soluble synthetic resin, having a volume average diameter of less than 900 and greater than 50 Angstroms, and having anion exchanging sites, at least on their outer surfaces, which attract available cation sites of Component A, wherein said microparticles are attached as a monolayer to the available surfaces of the Component A particles.
