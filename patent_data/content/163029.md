# EXPLOSIVE SHELL CASE

## Abstract
An explosive shell case of the kind in which fragments are produced by bursting of the case material into a number of small particles. The case material comprises a completely dense, non compressible material which is made with embrittling zones 4 which when the shell bursts gives fragments of a predetermined shape. The case is preferably manufactured powder metallurgically, the embrittling zones then being formed by filling at predetermined intervals with powder with the embrittling component. The case is then pressed under high all round pressure and high temperature into a dense, compact jacket and is imparted its final properties through heat treatment.
