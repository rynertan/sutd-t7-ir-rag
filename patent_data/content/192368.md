# Surface mount package for toroids.

## Abstract
A surface mount package for toroids or the like inductive elements has the element sandwiched between two non conductive plates. Spring clips hold the sandwich together, and the element leads are connected to the clips. The assembly is potted, leaving only one end of the clips exposed for surface mounting on a circuit board.
