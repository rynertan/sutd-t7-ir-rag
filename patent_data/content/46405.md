# Method of treating hydroperoxide mixtures.

## Abstract
A method of treating hydroperoxide mixtures com prises bringing an oily hydroperoxide mixture containing A an aromatic hydroperoxide having a hydroperoxymethyl group directly bonded to the aromatic nucleus and B an aromatic hydroperoxide having a 2 hydroperoxy 2 propyl group bonded directly to the aromatic nucleus into contact with an aqueous alkali solution, separating the aqueous phase from the oil phase and decomposing at least a part of the component A extracted in the aqueous phase. By this method, the starting oily hydroperoxide mixture can be converted to a mixture in which the primary hy droperoxide content A is reduced without substantial loss of the tertiary hydroperoxide B and hydroperoxide mix tures suitable for use in the production of phenols are obtained.
