# METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING BROADBAND INFORMATION OVER A NARROW BAND TRANSMISSION MEDIUM

## Abstract
An improved means for rapidly compressing, expand ing, and displaying broad band information which is trans mitted over a narrow band communications channel. In the preferred embodiment, a video image is cyclically assem bled in low resolution and high resolution phases from di gitized data representing gray level intensity for individual pixels which have been grouped into cells. During the initial cycle of the low resolution phase, a representative sample of said cell intensity values is transmitted by a sending sta tion to a receiving station according to a video compression routine. Said receiving station then uses a video expansion routine to calculate an intensity value for those cells and pi xels whose intensity values were not transmitted and dis plays an initial image. This image is refined during subse quent low resolution cycles by means of additional trans missions from the sending station which replace the calcu lated cell intensity values with an actual value for that cell. During the high resolution phase, an error determination routine or external input from a viewer selects those cells containing the greatest deviation in intensity levels from the input video image. The error compression and expansion routines substitute a plurality of individual pixel intensity values for single cell intensity values. The present invention also discloses a means for allow ing color capable stations to send or receive color transmis sions while retaining the capability to interact with noncolor stations. Color data is compressed and interleaved with black and white data by a color capable sending station and subsequently separated and expanded by a color capable receiving station.
