# METHOD FOR THE FORMATION OF COMPOSITE ARTICLES COMPRISED OF THERMOTROPIC LIQUID CRYSTALLINE POLYMERS AND ARTICLES PRODUCED THEREBY

## Abstract
A method for the production of composite articles by pultrusion is provided wherein the articles comprise thermo tropic liquid crystalline polymers and reinforcing fibres. The liquid crystalline polymers employed exhibit physical char acteristics such that the negative slope of a dynamic viscosity frequency curve as defined is less than about 0.35. The use of polymers having such rheological characteristics enables a composite material to be produced by pultrusion in which the polymer is uniformly dispersed among the reinforcing fibres.
