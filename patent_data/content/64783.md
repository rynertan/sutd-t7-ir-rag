# Photographic silver halide material for use in the silver complex diffusion transfer reversal process.

## Abstract
Photographic silver halide material suitable for use in the silver complex diffusion transfer reversal process for the production of a continuous tone positive silver image sensitometric curve I of the drawing on an image receiving material and a continuous tone negative silver image sensitometric curve II of the drawing in said photographic silver halide material itself, wherein said negative silver is image is usable per se for serving as an internegative in a photographic printing process. In said photographic material at each side of a transparent support a silver halide emulsion layer is present with different developing agent composition to yield the desired total silver image density and average gradient in the negative image.
