# IMAGE STORAGE AND DISPLAY

## Abstract
Images and respectively associated timing marks are arrayed, as phototransparencies, about a disk. The disk is rotated and the timing marks are sensed. Display occurs either in two dimensional fashion, such as in a television sys tem, or in three dimensional fashion such as in a semi transparent full image projection. Associated logic circuitry determines whether the full 3 D transparency is to be pro duced, in which case all images on the disk are to be illumi nated, or whether swim through will occur, either on an image at a time or on a ham slice projection basis.
