## Description
DESCRIPTION This invention relates to furniture and, more particularly, to apparatus for provii e resilient edge support in furniture having a support member and a load bear seat portion. In the furniture and upholstery industry, one method of providing a seat is to fabricate a support member and to locate on or in the support member a load bearing portion. Generally the load bearing portion is arranged to provide resilient support when sat on but comfort is impaired, at least at a front edge of the sat, due to a rid portion of the support member defining, or supporting material defining, the said cage. Various proposals nave been made to provide an edge support which is resilient. However, the proposals have included apparatus which is intended to be additional to seats comprising support members carrying load bearing portions in accordance with existing techniques. A disadvantage of such proposed resilient edge supports is that, because they are each supported on a resilient load bearing portion, they will mo e when forces are applied to and released from the lo d bearing portion causing stress in material supported by the resilient edge supports and eventual fracture of the material. According to the resent invention, there is provided apparatus for providing a resilient edge support in furniture having a support member and o load bearing seat portion, wherein the apparatus cotnprises means adapted to be secured to a portion of the support member for spacing the seat portion from the support member portion, means for supporting material defining the said edge, and means for locating the support means in spaced relation above the spacing means so that when a lead is applied to the support m ans in a direction towerds the sp cing means, the locating means is reslliently deflected towards the spacing means. The locating means may comprise a first series of members snd the support means msy comprise a first elengste member connecting the membors of the first series. The securing means may comprise second series of rembers extending parallel one to anether and each adapted to engage a second elongate member extending at right angles to the parallel axes of the second series of members, the second elongste member extend ing parallel to the first elongate member. The first and second elongate members may comprise opposite sides of a rectangular frame. The members of the first series of members are integral with corresponding ones of members of the second series of members. The members of the first and second series of members are of a single integral construction. Alternatively, each member of the first series is integral with a corresponding member of the second series Each of the members of the first and second series comprises two spaced parallel portions of wire connected by a bridging portion. Following is a description by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings of one method of carrying the invention into effect. In the drawings FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of one embodiment of apparatus in accordance with the present invention, the apparatus being shown in association with a support member and a load bearing seat portion, and FIGURE 2 is a perspective view of another embodiment of part of the apparatus. Referring no to FIGURE 1 of the drawings, the apparatus 10 comprises an elongate wire bent to form a series of parallel laterally spaced first projections 11 integral with an alternate series of parallel laterally spaced second projections 12. Each of the first projections 11 comprises a pair of members 13 and 14 extending parallel one to another and formed integrally with a bridging member 15. Each of the second projecting 12 comprises s pair of members 16 and 17 extending parallel one to another and formed integrally with a bridging member 18.The members 16 and 17 are contained in a plane inclined to a plane containing the members 13 and 14 so that the bridging members 18 extend in a plane above the bridging members 15 and each of the members 16, 17 is integral with an adjacent one of the members 13, 14 ond an intermediate loop portion 19. The loop portions 19 have extending therethrough one long side 20 of an elongate rectangular wire frame 21, the opposite long side 22 of which is connected to each of the bridging members 18 by means of clips 23. The anrratus 10 is loceted adjacent a frot portion 24 of a rectangular support member 25 having a rear portion 26. The rear portion 26 has secured thereto in longitudinal spaced relation end portions of parallel strips of elastic webbing 27, the longit udinal axes of the strips 27 extending at right angles to the rear portion 26 towards the front portion 24 of the support member 25. Opposite end potions of the strips 27 are guided around the long side 20 of the frame 21 and secured to intermediate portions thereof as shown at 29.The apparatus 10 then is moved towards the front portion. 24 of the support t member 25, thereby extending the strips 27, and the bridin members 15 are secured to the front portion 24 by clips not shown . In this manner, the strips 27 are supported in tension across the support member 25 and provide a load bearing portion. The frame is covered with fabric which extends over the apparatus 10 and defines an edge adjacent the lon3 side 22 of the wire frame 21. Preferably, the long side 22 of the wire frame 21 end the front portion 24 of the support member 25 are connected by strips of cord to provide initial tensioning of the members 16, 17b towards the members 13, 14. When the load bearing portion is sat upon, the thighs of the person sitting on the load bearing portion apply a load to the long side 22 of the frome 21 in a downward direction causing the members 16, 17 .resiliently to deflect towards the members 13, 14. However, when the load is released, the lon. side 22 of the frame 21 returns to its initial position due to the resilience of the members 16, 17. Referring now to FIGURE 2 of the drawings, there is shown a single spring 30 having the members 13 to 18. In enother embodiment of the apparatus according to the present invention, a plurality of springs 30 are used in association with the frame 21 instead of a length of wire formed integrally with the members 13 to 18.
