## Description
The present invention relates to method and apparatus of heating a strip of metallic material in a continuous annealing furnace. The FR 240 66 67 discloses a method for controlling the strip temperature within a continuous annealing furnace comprising a preheating zone as well as a speed heating zone. A further method is known from US 43 16 717. Whereby the processing temperature within the chamber is changed in response to a change in the gange of a well consisting of two joint metal strips. As shown in Fig. 6, a typical conventional continuous annealing furnace for continuously annealing a strip of metallic material such as cold rolled steel sheet, tin plated steel sheet or the like is so constructed that the strip 1 is unreeled from a payoff reel and it is then introduced into the furnace via cleaning tank, looper or the like. The furnace is provided with a plurality of rolls that are called helper rolls R in bath the upper and lower areas thereof and the strip 1 is subjected to heating or cooling at a temperature in the range of 650 C to 900 C in dependence on mechanical properties required for a product of strip while it moves up and down in the vertical direction in the area as defined between the upper and lower rolls R. After completion of annealing the strip has required metallic properties such as high tensile strength, capability of deep drawing or the like at the state of room temperature. In the recent years requirements have been raised from users for improved method and apparatus for continuously annealing a strip of metallic material having different thickness and width in accordance with different heat cycle independence on required mechanical properties of the product of strip, because there is a tendency of carrying out production in the form of many kinds and small quantity. In the conventional furnace the strip 1 in the heating zone is heated up to an elevated temperature by radiation of thermal energy in accordance with the radiant tube system. However, it is pointed out that the conventional furnace has a problem that temperature of the strip to be heated can not be controlled quickly in response to variation of the heat cycle required for the strip, because temperature of each of the radiant tubes has large time constant. For instance, when thickness of the strip 1 increase, that is, a strip having thickness more than that of the preceding strip is continuously treated and therefore the thick strip having large heat capacity moves through the heating zone, there is a necessity for raising temperature of the radiant tubes to a higher level. However, due to the fact that the radiant tubes themselves have large time constant in the range of 10 to 20 minutes, the strip 1 can not reach a predetermined temperature within a very short period of time after an intensity of combustion of the burners relative to the radiant tubes is changed. In the meanwhile it is acceptable to change line speed of the strip 1. When line speed of the strip 1 is left unchanged until the preceding thin strip 1 moves past the heating zone of the furnace, it results that the fore end part of the following thick strip is heated insufficiently. In practice, it was reported that a part of strip having very long length of 2000 to 5000 m was annealed insufficiently. When line speed of the following thick strip is reduced by a necessary extent in order to assure that it reaches a required temperature, it results that temperature of the strip is raised up excessively and thereby its is annealed excessively. This leads to production of a strip which has mechanical property softer than generally required one. Alternatively, when line speed of the strip is changed to an intermediate level, it is found that the preceding strip becomes softened while a part of the following strip is annealed insufficiently. On the contray, in the case where thickness of a strip to be annealed decreases in the cource of its moving through the heating zone in the furnace, it is obvious that reverse phenomenon will be recognized to the foregoing case. In the past time, users were generally willing to receive a product of strip which was softened to a level above required mechanical properties from the viewpoint of excellent workability. In the recent years, however, automation has been increasingly employed for elastic working process of metallic plate or the like material and this leads to a tendency that metallic material softened in the above described manner is not always willingly received by users. Thus, products which are uniformly treated as required become important for them. However, this causes the jointed area where two strips having different thickness are jointed to one another to be subjected to irregular treating by a considerably long distance. Therefore, the conventional annealing method can not be employed. To obviate the above mentioned problem concerning the jointed area where thickness of strips varies there was made a proposal that a dummy strip was interposed between two strips to be annealed and operating conditions of the furnace were changed properly during movement of the dummy strip through the heating zone. As a result, however, it is found that the furnace has a reduced treating capability. In the meanwhile, it is necessary that a possibly large quantity of strips having the same size or material are continuously annealed from the viewpoint of operation of the furnace at a high efficiency. This leads to a necessity that a large quantity of strips are kept in storage as inventry in the area located in proximity of the continuous annealing furnace in order to facilitate operation of the furnace as planned. As a result, inventory cost increases and moreover there occurs such an inconvenience that production can not be carried out in the acceptable timing relation as required. Further, in the case where thick strip is shifted to thin strip in the cource of annealing operation or in the case where thin strip is shifted to thick strip in the reverse manner, there occurs the following problem, particularly when difference of thickness between adjacent strips is remarkably large. For instance, in the case there thin strip is shifted to thick strip, gas having higher temperature is blown toward the moving strip through gas jet nozzles which are exposed to radiant tubes having lower temperature immediately after shifting of thickness is effected in that way. As a result, a high intensity of thermal stress is generated in the gas jet nozzles and this leads to a fear of causing deformation, damage or the like with the gas jet nozzles. Generally, the conventional continuous annealing furnace employed for continuously annealing a strip of metallic material is so constructed that preheating zone, heating zone, soaking zone and cooling zone inclusive excessive aging zone in the case where excessive aging treatment is required for the strip are arranged one after another as seen from the inlet side of the furnace. Heating in the preheating zone is achieved by direct heating with the use of exhaust gas which is delivered from the heating zone and the soaking zone or by blowing hot air toward the strip of which temperature is raised up to an elevated level by heat exchanging with exhaust gas. Further, heating in the heating zone as well as in the soaking zone is achieved by means of a plurality of radiant tubes. On the other hand, cooling in the cooling zone is achieved in accordance with roll cooling system, gas jet cooling system or cooling tube system. In the meanwhile, temperature of strip at the outlet of the heating zone is controlled to reach a target temperature by controlling line speed in such a manner that a value of thickness of strip x line speed is kept constant while temperature of the heating zone is left unchanged, when thickness of a strip is changed to another one with the same heat cycle used during the whole operation. In the case where the existing heat cycle is changed to another one, temperature of the strip at the outlet of the heating zone is controlled by changing the preset temperature in the heating zone. However, it is found that the conventional continuous annealing furnace has a drawback that the heating zone has slow heat responsibility relative to temperature thereof and it takes 20 to 30 minutes when the preset temperature of the heating zone is changed to another one and thereby there appears difference of temperature, for instance, 100 . Accordingly, material rejection equivalent to the length of about one coil takes place due to insifficient heating, for instance, when line speed is held at a level of 300 mpm. This means that there is a necessity for preparing a dummy coil having a length as mentioned above. However, a period of time for which the dummy coil moves past the heating zone in the furnace does not make any contribution to production and moreover using of the dummy coil is not preferable from the viewpoint of thermal energy saving. Further, when such a dummy coil is used for the furnace, extra operations such as welding of the dummy coil before it enters the heating zone, cutting of the same after it leaves there and handling of the same in the area extending from the inlet to the outlet of the heating zone. Another drawback of the conventional continuous annealing furnace is that when thickness of a strip is changed to another one with the same heat cycle employed therefor, material rejection takes place by a certain distance in the area located before and behind the welded point of the strip, because another line speed can not be quickly determined in response to changing of thickness of the strip. To obviate the above mentioned drawback, temperature of the strip at the outlet of the heating zone is kept within the extent of allowable temperature by limiting an amount of changing of thickness of strip, for instance, within 15 of thickness of the preceding strip whereby rejection due to material failure is inhibited. However, such a countermeasure as mentioned above makes it complicated to design operation schedule relative to a strip to be annealed and control a number of coils in a coil storage house. Hence, the present invention has been made in the foregoing background in mind. To accomplish the above objects there are proposed according to the present invention the method and apparatus for heating a strip in a continuous annealing furnace, as explained in detail in the claims. The present invention will be described in more details below as to continuous heating means required in the case where thin strip is shifted to thick strip. According to the invention an intensity of combustion in the radiant tube burners is quickly raised up to a level corresponding to thus shifted thick strip before shifting is effected. It should be noted that quick temperature increase does not occur due to the fact that the radiant tubes themselves have large heat capacity but an amount of thermal energy required for thin strip becomes excessive gradually. For the reason it is necessary that an amount of thermal energy which becomes excessive gradually is removed at the same time when an intensity of combustion in the radiant tube burners is raised up. To this end an amount of cooling gas is gradually increased so that it is blown toward the strip. Blowing of cooling gas is interrupted when thickness of the strip to be annealed is changed. Since the present invention consists in that gas to be blown through the gas jet nozzles is supplied gradually and occurrence of thermal stress due to gas blown through the gas jet nozzles is inhibited effectively. Thus, a period of response time in the heating zone can be shortened when thickness of strip is changed. According to the invention as defined in the preceding paragraphs IV and V the continuous annealing furnace is provided with a strip temperature controlling zone located in a part of the heating zone where heating is effected in accordance with radiant tube system and thereby temperature of a strip to be annealed can be controlled to reach to a target level by blowing heating or cooling gas jet directly toward the strip to quickly raise or lower the existing temperature. Thus, operation of the furnace is carried out properly without any complicated handling as well as utilization of dummy coil. By the way, an amount of thermal energy Q When an amount of thermal energy Q However, in the case where heating or cooling is effected by means of gas jet, an amount of thermal energy received on strip to be annealed can be easily and quickly changed by changing flow speed of gas. Further, in the case where heating or cooling is effected by means of rolls, an amount of thermal energy received on strip to be annealed can be easily and quickly changed by changing winding angle of rolls relative to the strip, and the number of rolls about which the strip is wound, that is, period of time for which the strip comes in contact with the rolls. As means for changing flow speed of gas jet it is recommendable to employ a damper of which function is to adjust a flow rate of gas jet. Further, in the case where a plurality of rolls are employed for the purpose of heating or cooling it is recommendable to use driving rolls which are able to carry out thrusting relative to the strip. When a strip having different thickness over the whole length thereof is introduced into the continuous annealing furnace of the invention, an intensity of combustion in radiant tube burners is adjusted properly and gas of which temperature is determined to a required level to adjust temperature of the strip is blown toward the strip through a plurality of gas jet means for a short period of time. Owing to the arrangement made in that way it is assured that quick temperature controlling is achieved properly while compensating for low temperature respondency of the radiant tubes. Further, since the gas jet means are arranged in the area extending from the rear part of the heating zone to the rearmost end of the same, proper temperature controlling can be achieved from the leading end of the strip while the preceding heat cycle is shifted to another one. Finally, advantageous features of the present invention will be described below. ated by the gas jet nozzles. The accompanying drawings will be briefly described below.

Fig. 3 is a fragmental schematic vertical sectional view of a heating furnace which is employed for carrying out the invention. The drawing shows the case where heating is achieved by means of a plurality of radiant tubes from both the sides of the strip. In the drawings reference numeral 1 designates a strip of metallic material, reference numeral 2 does a plenum chamber, reference numeral 3 does a gas jet nozzle, reference numeral 4 does a radiant tube, reference numeral 5 does a furnace wall which is lined with thermal insulating material having small heat capacity such as ceramic fiber or the like and reference numeral 6 does a gas feeding duct through which gas is introduced into the plenum chamber 2. Further, reference numeral 10 designates pebble shaped heat storing medium hereinafter referred to simply as pebble made of material having a high melting temperature such as ceralic or the like, reference numeral 11 does a filled structure which is filled with the pebble 10 hereinafter referred to as pebble heater , reference numeral 12 does a gas feeding duct through which hot gas having a temperature in the range of 1200 to 1300 C is introduced into the pebble heater 11, reference numeral 13 does a HN gas feeding duct through which HN gas mixture gas of hydrogen and nitrogen having a comparatively low temperature is introduced into the pebble heater and reference numeral 14 does a bypass duct for HN gas. Hot gas is fed into the pebble heater 11 through the gas feeding duct 12 from the top side of the pebble heater 11 and it is then discharged from the bottom of the same. On the other hand, HN gas is fed into the pebble heater 11 through the feeding duct 13 from the bottom side of the pebble heater 11 and it is then delivered to the plenum chamber 2 from the top of the same. Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view of the heating furnace taken in line IV IV in Fig. 1. In the drawing reference numeral 7 designates a combustion burner which is used exclusively for the radiant tube 4 and reference numeral 8 does a discharging duct through which HN gas flowing out of the plenum chamber 2 is discharged to the outside. It should be noted that thus discharged HN gas may be reused by flowing back to the HN gas feeding duct 13. Refering to Fig. 1 again, for instance, in the case where steady operation is performed by heating the strip 1 having the same thickness, heating is achieved merely by means of a plurality of radiant tubes. When operating conditions such as heat cycle, thickness of strip, width of strip, line speed or the like are caused to vary, for instance, when the following strip has an increased thickness compaired with the thickness of the preceding strip and thereby an intensity of heating is required to increase, hot gas which is previously heated up to an elevated temperature in the range of 1200 to 1300 C with the aid of a heater which is not shown in the drawings is first introduced into the pebble heater 11 through the duct 12 during steady operation of the furnace as mentioned above. At this moment distribution of temperature of the pebble 10 in the pebble heater 11 is as shown in Fig. 3 A . As is apparent from the drawing, temperature of the pebble 10 varies in such a manner that it comes closer to temperature of gas during heat storing, as time elapses. Thus, temperature in the pebble heater 11 can be maintained at a level of that of hot gas in that way. Next, an intensity of combustion of the radiant tube burners is caused to increase immediately after the strip 1 having an increased thickness enters the furnace. At the same time HN gas is supplied into the pebble heater 11 from the bottom side thereof through the duct 13. This causes distribution of temperature in the pebble heater 11 to vary as shown in Fig. 3 B which illustrates how temperature in the pebble heater 11 varies during heat radiating. Since HN gas having lower temperature is brought in contact with the hot pebble 10 having large heat capacity, it results that temperature of HN gas increases rapidly. As a result, gas of which temperature at the outlet of the pebble heater 11 is raised up to a level of the maximum temperature 1200 to 1300 C of the pebble heater 11 within a period of several seconds can be fed into the plenum chamber 2 for 10 to 20 minutes until temperature of the radiant tubes reaches a steady state whereby temperature of the strip can be raised up to a predetermined temperature. Accordingly, gas jet having high temperature can be blown toward the strip 1 having an increased thickness for a very short period of time compaired with the number of radiant tubes immediately after the strip 1 has had an increased thickness. This means that temperature of the strip 1 can be instantaneously raised up to a predetermined level of temperature, resulting in the length of a part of the strip 1 where annealing is carried out insufficiently being reduced remarkably. On the other hand, for instance, in the case where thickness decreases, a part of HN gas having lower teme temperature near to room temperature is caused to bypass so that it is mixed with the other part of HN Gas which has been heated up to an elevated temperature. Thus, by properly adjusting a ratio of mixing, gas having a properly determined lower level of temperature can be supplied to the furnace within a period of several seconds in response to variation of thickness of the strip. The present invention has been described above with respect to the case where a vertically extending strip of metallic material is subjected to heating on both the side thereof. It should of cource be understood that it should not be limited only to this but it may be applied to the case where the furnace has a horizontally extending heating zone as well as the case where heating is generally carried out for a strip of metallic material in accordance with radiant tube system. Further, the present invention should not be limited to the case where the pebble heater heat storing type heater with heat storing medium filled therein is employed for the furnace but other kind of means for adjusting temperature of gas and flow rate of the same may be employed for the same purpose. Further, the heating method as illustrated in Fig. 1 will be described in more details with reference to Figs. 4 A to C as well as Figs. 5 A to C . First, Fig. 4 shows the case where thickness of the strip varies in such a manner that a thin strip is shifted to a thick strip, wherein Fig. 4 A illustrates how thickness of the strip varies as time elapses, Fig. 4 B does how temperature of the radiant tubes varies as time elapses and Fig. 4 C does how a flow rate of cooling gas jet varies as time elapses. As is apparent from Fig. 4 B , when thin strip is to be shifted to thick one, operation for raising temperature of the radiant tubes is initiated at time of two hours before shifting is effected in that way. It should be noted that temperature is gradually raised because the radiant tubes themselves have large time constant. This causes the thin strip to be gradually subjected to excessive heating until thickness shifting is completed. Thus, to assure that the thin strip maintains proper temperature during heating, a flow rate of cooling gas jet is caused to gradually increase for the purpose of cooling it until thickness shifting takes place. Next, Fig. 5 shows the case where thickness of the strip varies in such a manner that a thick strip is shifted to a thin strip, wherein Fig. 5 A illustrates how thickness of the strip varies as time elapses, Fig. 5 B does how temperature of the radiant tubes varies as time elapses and Fig. 5 C does how a flow rate of cooling gas jet varies as time elapses. As is apparent from Fig. 5 B , when thick strip is to be shifted to thin strip, operation for lowering temperature of the radiant tubes is initiated at time of two hours before shifting is effected in that way. It should be noted that temperature is gradually lowered because the radiant tubes themselves have large time constant. This causes the thick strip to be gradually subjected to heating with a reduced amount of thermal energy until thickness shifting is completed. To compensate for shortage of thermal energy, a flow rate of gas of which temperature is determined higher than that of the strip is caused to gradually increase and heating is effected for the strip with an increased flow rate of gas until thickness shifting takes place. The present invention has been described above with respect to the case where a strip of metallic material is subjected to heating on both the sides thereof with the aid of a number of radiant tubes which are arranged one above another in the vertically aligned relation. It should of cource be understood that it should not be limited only to this but it may be applied to the case where the furnace has a heating zone having the trapezoidal configuration as seen from the side as well as the case where heating is generally carried out for a strip of metallic material in accordance with the conventional radiant tube system. Further, the present invention should not be limited to the case where the pebble heater heat storing type heater with heat storing medium filled therein is employed for the furnace but other kind of means for adjusting temperature of gas and flow rate of the same may be employed for the same purpose. Fig. 7 is a schematic vertical sectional side view of an essential part in the continuous annealing furnace in accordance with the fourth embodiment of the invention. As shown in Fig. 7, the furnace includes a plurality of heating zones comprising a heating zone 114 and a soaking zone 115. As is apparent from the drawing, a number of plenum chambers 121 serving as gas jet means are arranged in the spaced relation with a number of radiant tubes 119 located in the proximity of the the plenum chambers 121 in the area extending from the rear part of the heating zone 114 to the rearmost end of the soaking zone 115, that is, over the area including the rear part of the heating zone 114 and the whole soaking zone 115. In this embodiment, for instance, when a strip 111 which has an increased thickness for the purpose of increasing a production rate is to be supplied to the continuous annealing furnace 112, an intensity of combustion of the burners for the radiant tubes 119 in both the heating zone 114 and the soaking zone 115 is raised up and HN gas which is heated to a required elevated temperature with the aid of gas jet means is blown toward the moving strip 111 until temperature of the radiant tubes 119 reaches a required high level. As a result, the strip 111 can be heated up to a required level of temperature without any time delay. It should be noted that since gas jet means are arranged over the area including the rear part of the heating zone 114 and the whole soaking zone 115, the strip 111 of which thickness is changed in response to change of production rate can be controlled to maintain a proper temperature, starting with the foremost end part of the strip 111. If gas jet means are arranged only in the intermediate part of the heating zone, variation of temperature of the radiant tubes 119 located behind gas jet means as seen in the direction of movement of the strip 111 is caused to delay whereby the foremost end part of the strip 111 leaves the heating zone before it reaches the predetermined level of temperature. In view of the above mentioned fact the scope of area at the fore end part of the heating zone where gas jet means are arranged should be determined in dependence on an extent of fluctuation of thermal load normally about 20 corresponding to fluctuation of an amount of thermal load which is obtainable by composite multiplication of heat cycle or line speed of the strip 111 to be annealed and thickness of the strip and temperature difference equivalent to an extent of increasing of temperature of the strip. It is preferable that gas jet means are arranged in the area extending from the position where an amount of thermal load on the strip 111 is reduced by 20 to 30 in the heating zone 114 to the rearmost end position of the latter. If the area where gas jet means are arranged is determined small, there is a fear of causing such a malfunction that the strip 111 to be annealed is heated higher than the predetermined annealing temperature before it reaches the area where they are arranged, that is, so called superheating, for instance, when the strip has a reduced thickness. Fig.8 A illustrates how temperature of the strip to be annealed varies in the furnace as constructed in accordance with this embodiment. As is apparent from the drawing, temperature of the strip is raised up at a higher rate than in the case of the normal operating state as represented by a dotted line, for instance, when thickness of the strip is reduced and thereby an amount of thermal load decreases. However, when it reaches the area Z where gas jet means are arranged, it is restrained within the predetermined level of temperature. Next, Fig. 8 B illustrates how temperature of the strip to be annealed varies in the furnace as constructed in accordance with a modified embodiment of the invention where the area Z there gas jet means are arranged is divided into two sections. In this embodiment gas jet means are additionally arranged in the intermediate area of the heating zone 114. Next, Figs. 11 A and B are a graph similar to Figs. 8 A and B respectively which show the case where the present invention is applied to a continuous annealing furnace which is not provided with the soaking zone 115 in Fig. 7. Obviously, in the continuous annealing furnace which is not provided with the soaking zone 115 a heating area is constituted merely by the heating zone 114. Accordingly, gas jet means are arranged in the area located at the rear part of the heating zone 114. The present invention has been described above with respect to the case where thickness of the strip 111 is reduced and an amount of thermal load decreases. When thickness of the strip, width of the same and line speed increase and thereby an amount of thermal load is caused to increase, HN gas comprising a mixture gas having a required high temperature is introduced into the plenum chambers 121 whereby the strip 111 can maintain a required high annealing temperature for a period of time until temperature generated by means of the radiant tubes 119 is raised up to a required high level of temperature. Fig. 10 schematically illustrates how a continuous anealing furnace Fig. 11 schematically illustrates how the conventional continuous annealing furnace is constructed for steel strips which are subjected to rolling at a lower temperature and Fig. 12 shows heat curves which extend from the preheating zone to the outlet of the heating zone in the conventional continuous annealing furnace. In Fig. 12 preference letter A designates a heat curve which was obtained when a strip of cold rolled steel having a thickness of 1.0 mm and a width of 1200 mm was annealed at a line speed of 300 mpm, whereas reference letter B does a heat curve which was obtained when a strip of cold rolled steel having a thickness of 0.75 mm and a width of 1200 mm was annealed at a line speed of 300 mpm. As is readily apparent from comparision between the curves A and B for cold rolled steel strip which were obtained by operating the conventional continuous annealing furnace, there occurs temperature difference of about 70 C at the outlet of the heating zone when both the cold rolled steel strips A and B are annealed at the same line speed and the cold rolled steel strip B is excessively heated by 50 C relative to a target temperature of strip of 780 C 20 0. Further, Fig. 13 illustrates how strip temperature T Next, Fig. 14 shows heat curves which are obtainable when the method of the invention is employed. In the drawing reference letter C designates a heat curve which was obtained in the same manner as in the case of the heat curve A when a strip of cold rolled steel having a thickness of 1.0 mm and a width of 1200 mm was annealed at a line speed of 300 mpm, whereas reference letter D does a heat curve in the same manner as in the case of the heat curve B when a strip of cold rolled steel having a thickness of 0.75 mm and a width of 1200 mm was annealed at a line speed of 300 mpm. A target temperature of 780 C can be reached at the outlet of the heating zone by lowering a temperature of cold rolled steel D to 610 C in the strip temperature controlling zone Next, Fig. 15 is a graph which illustrates how the preset temperature T Function of the controlling zone has been described above with respect to the case where preset temperature of a strip at the heating zone is changed to the lower side but controlling can be effected at the quitely same manner as in the foregoing case also in the case where it is changed to the higher temperature side.
