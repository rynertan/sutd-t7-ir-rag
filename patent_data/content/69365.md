# Angular rate sensor.

## Abstract
An angular rate sensor of the class wherein two electro magnetic waves are travelling in opposite directions is disclosed. In this sensor 100 each wave is substantially travelling about a closed loop path. The frequency of each of said waves is a function of the rate of rotation of said closed loop path so that a corresponding phase relationship is established between said waves as a function of the rate of rotation. To prevent a lock in error biasing means 30 are provided for dithering the angular rate sensor 100 . Control means 32 are controlling said biasing means 30 in order to alter the phase ψ of said phase relationship such that phase values occurring at a pair of successive occurrences of dψ dt being zero and d²ψ dt² being of the same polarity are such that said phase values differ by π radians.
