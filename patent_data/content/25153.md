# Portable tool such as a rotary hammer or the like.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a combin ation rotary and percussive portable tool 11 driven by an electric motor. The percussive means includes a reciprocating cylinder 47 having embodied therein a reciprocatable piston striker 50,51 . The cylinder 47 is mounted in a guide tube 48 which is spring loaded by a spring 63 positioned between an internal wall 61 in the housing 60 and a cap 56 removably mounted over an opening 69 of the housing 63 . The opening pro vides access to the housing 60 in order to remove the guide tube 48 and spring. With guide tube 48 resiliently mounted in the housing, the guide tube and its interface with the hous ing 60 is much less affected by the vibration and thermal conditions developed during operation of the tool. In addition, the tolerances required to mount the guide tube 48 in the housing 60 do not have to be kept as tight as they would have to be if a conventional mounting arrangement using welds or other rigid fastening means were used.
