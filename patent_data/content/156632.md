# Erodible polymers and paints for fouling control.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a novel polymeric binder for use in an antifouling paint which includes a toxicant. The polymeric binder is film forming, water insoluble, seawater erodible and is represented by the formula The polymer has a hydrolysis rate of at least 5 10‚Å¥ mil liequivalents per hour. The resultant paint has an erosion rate of at least 2 microns per month. R can be selected from the group consisting of
