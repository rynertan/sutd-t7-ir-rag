# Gerotor pumps.

## Abstract
A gerotor pump of n and n 1 type has the annulus 20 and rotor 18 located in a chamber with one wall provided by a floating coverplate 22 held in place by a spring 24 so that in the event of excess internal pressure the cover 22 can lift to allow cross leakage between the inlet and outlet sides of the pump. Figure 2 illustrates a typical embodiment.
