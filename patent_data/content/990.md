# Unbalanced balanced converter circuits.

## Abstract
Unbalanced balanced converter circuit in which a first circuit T1, T2 of controllable impedance is connected between a first supply terminal earth and a first balanced terminal A leg , a second circuit T3, T4 of controllable impedance is connected between a second supply terminal 48V d.c. and a second belanced terminal B leg , and a control circuit R, R2, A1 is connected to monitor any departure from balance of the potentials of the first and second balanced input output terminals and to simultaneously change the impedances of the first and second circuits T1, T2 and T3, T4 resp. of controllable impedance in opposite directions to restore the potentials to balance. A first unbalanced terminal X is connected via C6 to one balanced terminal A leg and a second unbalanced terminal is connected to a common point earth . A principal use of the invention is balance unbalanced conversion of a subscriber s telephone line.
