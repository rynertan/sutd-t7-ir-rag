# Pocket elevator.

## Abstract
An elevating conveyor which operates as pocket eleva tor to transfer granular, powdered or like material from a loading station 9 through an elevating section 11 to a discharge zone wherein an endless conveyor belt 1 co operates with a further conveyor part 13 or 47 which may either be a fixed plate or a further endless belt at least in the elevating section, the first mentioned belt 1 being provided with transverse bars 17 on its surface facing the further conveyor part, which bars are preferably located between belt side walls, the height of the bars being almost sufficient to bridge the gap between the surface of the belt and the opposed surface of the further conveyor part but having a clearance with the further conveyor part which corresponds to between 1 und 3 times the maximum particle particle size of the material being conveyed and elevated and elevated and preferably being about 1 times the maximum particle size. This arrangement causes the material being conveyed to bridge and support itself in pockets. The belt side walls may be of solid construction and means may be provided to reduce heat build up at the top surface of the side walls or alternatively the side walls may be generally corrugated when viewed in plan.
