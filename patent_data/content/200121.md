# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR THE AUTOMATIC DISCHARGE AND RESTART OF A CROSS WINDING MACHINE

## Abstract
The apparatus comprises a spindle V on which the bobbin RC is formed, and which is axially shiftable from a retracted discharge position to an expanded working posi tion, so as to cooperate with a fixed extractor E whereby when the spindle carrying the formed bobbin is retracted, the bobbin abuts against the extractor and is discharged. The spindle is provided on its free end with a frontally toothed portion D . The spindle can be moved from a bobbin forming station K to a tie in and discharge station K , while the yarn F is maintained under tension. On the side surface of the formed bobbin at the tie in and discharge station, at one end of the bobbin, there is positioned a needle 50 having a hook 150 . A winding rotation is imparted to said bobbin and to said needle so that the body of the needle will be enfolded by a suitable number of turns FX of yarn. The yarn is then displaced to form one turn FX engaging the hook of the needle, which is then stopped together with the bobbin. The needle is retracted so that it will cause the tail end of the yarn to be bent into a U shape and to be passed beneath the turns. Means 54 are provided for cutting the yarn and for retaining the leading end of said yarn. At this point, the bobbin is discharged by retracting the spindle and subsequently the spindle is moved again to the bobbin forming station where it is extended to its working position so that its tooted end will engage the leading end of the yarn retained by the cutting and retaining means and a new cycle of the winding machine can be resumed upon re starting the rotary motion of the spindle.
