# RECOVERY FOR SOLVENT FROM A HYDROCARBON EXTRACT

## Abstract
An energy saving process for recovery of solvent from a solvent oil mixture in a staged series of vaporization zones at progressively increasing pressure in which exter nal heat is supplied to the vaporization stage having the highest pressure and heat for each preceding vaporization stage is supplied by heat exchange with vapors from suc ceeding vaporization stages with vaporization at the lowest pressure stage carried out in a plurality of vaporization zones at substantially equal pressure.
