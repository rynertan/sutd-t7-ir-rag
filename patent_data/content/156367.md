# SORTING METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for product sorting involves a system in which products are singulated at 14 and examined at 72 in a fluid stream. The fluidized products may be con veyed by an annular flow eductor 16 through a bypass unit 18 that regulates and withdraws a portion of the fluid flow. After sorting, the products may be decelerated by tangen tially injecting them into the upper portion of a cyclone sep arator 76 , and allowing them to gradually decelerate as they spin within the separator.
