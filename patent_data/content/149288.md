## Description
METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING POWER BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to power production, and more particularly concerns use of a two phase nozzle in a process employing a fluid exhibiting a regressive vapor dome in the temperatureentropy plane. Conventional vapor turbines operating in systems utilizing waste heat as energy sources encounter a pinch point problem in transferring the energy from the waste heat to the working fluid. The problem is a result of the heat of vaporization that must be absorbed to vaporize the working fluid as shown in Fig.1, so that the energy can be transformed into shaft work in a vapor turbine. As a result, there always exists a large temperature difference between the temperature of the exhaust gas and the working fluid see tTpp on Fig. 1 . This limits the upper temperature of the working fluid which in turn limits the thermodynamic efficiency of the system.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is a major object of the invention to provide a power producing system and process wherein the working fluid exhibits a regressive saturated vapor line, i.e. one wherein the entropy decreases as the temperature of the saturated vapor decreases. Basically, the invention involves the use of a two phase nozzle in such a system, and includes the steps a receiving the fluid in pressurized and heated liquid state in a two phase nozzle, and expanding the received liquid therein into a discharge jet consisting of saturated or superheated vapor, b and converting the kinetic energy of said vapor jet into power. In this regard, the use of a fluid with a regressive vapor dome eliminates the above described problem, and as further shown in Fig. 2. The fluid exiting the heat exchanger is in the liquid state.Expansion through a two phase nozzle from state points 1 to 2 results in a high velocity pure vapor at the nozzle exit. As will be seen, the working fluid is typically a hydrocarbon or a fluorocarbon, examples beingDOWTHERM A or certain freons and the two phase nozzle facilitates production of a jet consisting substantially completely of superheated vapor, whereby turbine efficiency can be increased. Overall turbine efficiency is enhanced by provision of both impulse and reaction turbine stages, as will be seen. The punt invention is fluid expansion power apparatus characterized by a a two phase nozzle receiving a fluid in pressurized and heated liquid state, said fluid having a regressive vapor dome in a T S diagram, and expanding said received liquid into saturated or superheated vapor state, and b means receiving said saturated or superheated vapor to convert the kinetic energy thereof into power. An embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a temperature entropy diagram Fig. 2 is a temperature entropy diagram Fig. 3 is a temperature entropy diagram and Fig. 4 is a schematic showing of a vapor turbine system.DETAILED DESCRIPTION Referring first to Fig. 3, a temperatureentropy curve 10 is shown for a fluid having a regressive vapor dome. The line 10a defining the left side of the curve 10 corresponds to saturated liquid, and the regressive line lOb defining the right side of the curve 10 corresponds to saturated vapor. Some fluids may exhibit T S curves such as shown at 10, and examples are the liquid mix known as DOWTHERM A a product of Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Michigan , certain fluorocarbons and other hydrocarbon liquid mixes. Typical fluorocarbons are R 114, R 216 and trifluoroethanol. Fluids with regressive vapor domes as shown can be expanded from their saturated liquid state line 10a through the vapor dome into the superheat region to line lOb, for example . In accordance with the invention, a two phase nozzle 12 is employed as in Fig. 4 to carry out the expansion through the vapor dome, as referred to.Examples of such nozzles are those described in U.S.Patent 3,879,949. Such expansion can take place at high efficiency such as about 90X to yeild a vapor jet at 12a with velocities of discharged vapor in the range of about 1000 feet per second. Such jet velocities are not excessive, the latent heat of vaporization of such fluids typically being around 100 B lbm, where B British thermal unit Ibm pound mass. As shown in Fig. 4 the jet is passed to turbine means to convert the kinetic energy of the jet into power. See for example the impulse vapor turbine 13 receiving th superhe ated vapor jet, and dOscharging it at 14. A power take off shaft is indicated at 15, and may be used to drive a pump, generator, etc., indicated at 15a. See also the reaction vapor turbine 16 connected in series with turbine 13 to receive the vapor discharge 14, and discharge the reduced temperature vapor at 17.See point 03 in both Figs. 3 and 4. Both turbines are thereby driven, the power take off for reaction vapor turbine 16 being indicated at 16a. In general, in an impulse vapor turbine, the total pressure drop for a stage is taken across elements or blades stators , whereas in a reaction turbine, the total pressure drop for a stage is divided between stationary blades and rotating blades, these two types of turbines being well known per se. Referring to Fig. 4 the vaporized and discharge fluid 17 is then passed at 18 to a condenser 19, the condensate 20 being re pumped at 21 to a pressure p1 equal to the pressure of liquid entering the nozzle 12. Prior to passage to the nozzle, the liquid is heated in a heat exchanger 23 to initial temperature T1. Heat added to the liquid in exchanger 23 is indicated at QA. Also, note corresponding points Q4 and and commat in Figs. 3 and 4. The advantages of the described system include 1 Provision of high efficiency without the need for boilers or regenerators, enabling the system to operate at high upper cycle temperature for a given heat source temperature. 2 Spouting nozzle jet velocities can be limited to about 1000 ft sec. 3 Use of conventional turbines, as described. 4 Nozzle efficiency is high typically greater than 90X because mostly vapor flows through the diverging section of the nozzle.
