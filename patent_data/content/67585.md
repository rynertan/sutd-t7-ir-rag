# Noise sensitivity reduction for a TV receiver AGC system.

## Abstract
Video is applied via a gain controlled IF amplifier 11 to a video detector 13 and amplifier 15 . Sync and equalising pulses are fed from the amplifier to an active filter 21 26 and then to a comparator 30 , which produces an output variation for changing an AGC voltage produced by gener ator 40 and AGC capacitor 41 if the pulse peaks exceed a threshold. The filter 21 26 delays and attenuated noise impulses, but can also cause noise impulses to remain above the threshold for a period of time defined by pulse stretching in the filter. A transistor 32 is responsive to a potential difference of predetermined sense and magnitude between the input and output of the filter to curtail the output variation of the comparator 30 . Such a difference exists when a delayed leading edge of a noise pulse is present at the output of the filter and the trailing edge is at the input.
