# Silver halide color photographic light sensitive material.

## Abstract
A silver halide color photographic light sensitive mate rial comprising a support arranged thereon with red sensitive layers, green sensitive layers and blue sensitive layers each comprising not less than two silver halide emulsion layers which are different in sensitivity from each other, satisfying the following four requirements a. The highest blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer BH of said blue sensitive layers in so arranged as to serve as the silver halide emulsion layer in the farthest position from said support. b. The highest green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer GH of said blue sensitive layers and the highest red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer RH of said red sensitive layers are interposed between said blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer BH and a blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer Bh which is lower in sensitivity than said emulsion layer BH . c. Anyone of the lowest sensitive silver halide emulsion layers BL, GL and RL, respectively of said blue sensitive layers, green sensitive layers and red sensitive layers is not on the further side from the support with respect to said blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, Bh , and d. A non light sensitive hydrophilic colloidal layer is arranged adjacent to said blue sensitive silver halide emul sion layer Bh .
