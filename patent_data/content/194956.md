# STAND JUMPING AND STABBING GUIDE DEVICE AND METHOD

## Abstract
A well tool and method for making up and breaking out connections between sections of drill pipe. The tool will jump the upper pipe section out of the connection when the connection has been completely unthreaded, and will guide the upper pipe section during stabbing. A piston and cylinder assembly is mounted on the carriage for raising and lowering the pipe spinner relative to the carriage. The tool also has an actuator and a pilot valve for automatically opening the clamping cylinders of the spinner whenever the upper pipe section is raised by the pipe elevator.
