# Process for producing anthraquinone compounds.

## Abstract
A process for producing 1,4 diaminoanthraquinone 2,3 disulfonic acid or a salt thereof comprises reacting a 1,4 diamino 2,3 dihalogenoanthraquinone with a sulfonat ing agent in an aqueous medium in the presence of at least one of a quaternary ammonium compound and a quaternary phosphonium compound and, optionally, an inert organic solvent. The thus obtained 1,4 diaminoanthraquinone 2,3 disulfonic acid or salt thereof may be reacted with a cyanogenation agent to produce 1,4 diamino 2,3 dicyano anthraquinone.
