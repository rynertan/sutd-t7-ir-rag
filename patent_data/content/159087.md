## Description
A process for preparing an implant material which releases medicines in the body. This invention relates to a system which after implantation releases a medicine to its surroundings, and which during the process of release is dissolved in full. It can be inferred from an article by Wahling et al. The release of gentamycin from polymethylmethacrylate beads, J. Bone Joint Surg.Br. Vol., 1978, 60, 270 that a two component system consisting of beads of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement in which the antibiotic gentamycin is dissolved is capable of successfully treating osteomyelitis.One disadvantage is that after the release of the antibiotic the beads of bone cement must be surgically removed from the bone. In the literature, therefore, certain methods are indicated of using, instead of the nonresorbing bone cement, a material that is dissolved in the body itself, so that surgical removal is unnecessary. A first method is the use of beta whitlockite instead of bone cement. Beta whitlockite chemical formula Ca3 P04 2 is, under certain conditions, more or less soluble. The e biological dissolving process depends on the way in which the subject product has been sintered. Sintering is a process see a Chapter by K. de Groot in the book Biocompatibility of Clinical Implant Materials , Editor D.F. Williams,C.R.C. Press, Boca Raton, USA, 1981, 199 224 the principle of which is that by heating powder particles are cemented together via solidstate diffusion, so that from a powder, a solid body is formed . The rate of dissolution is promoted by ensuring that the powder particles are only connected together by means of small necks . Eittenmuller et al. see his paper entitled Resorbierbare Antibiotik Antiseptische TCPkeramik zur lokalen Behandlung der Osteomyelitis, 1.Koelner Workshop uber Hydroxylkeramik, Cologne, December 7, 1983 have used this betawhitlockite also referred to as beta TCP or B TCP in a highly porous form as a carrier for an antibiotic, instead of bone cement. A second method is the use of calcium sulphate Plaster of Paris .Varlet et al., in the article Billes de platre de Paris aux antibiotique dans le traitement de 1 infection osseuse, in Revue de ChirurgieOrthopedique , 1983, 69, 239 244, have indicated and shown that gypsum, too, can function as a biologically soluble bead. Their method is predicated on gypsum being made up with the medicine to form a solid final product by adding water , which like Eitenmuller s TCP has a highly porous composition. Other methods are not based on ceramic starting materials, and accordingly fall outside the scope of the present patent application. Characteristic of both methods is that the medicine antibiotic is released by diffusion, whereafter the remaining implant the remaining component is resorbed, so that the surgical removal of the beads is unnecessary. It follows that the release of the medicine is not determined by the rate of biodegradation of the implant system . Both methods, however, have certain disadvantages. Beta TCP has the disadvantage that the dissolving process may have adverse sideeffects. The cause is as follows. After being implanted, a porous betaTCP product, on account of the loose bond between the sintered particles weak necks disintegrates into loose particles, which in turn are carried off by macrophages to neighbouring lymph glands. Depending on the weakness of the bond between the sintered particles, the dissolving process which is thus effected is taking place at a faster or slower rate. Non porous beta whitlockite is hardly resorbed . In certain cases the particles carried off are not intracellularly dissolved before the lymph glands are reached, so that, in that case, the lymph glands are filled with calcium phosphate particles.If no macrophages are present, or not enough, particles are accumulated around the implant, whereby further release is adversely affected. A second disadvantage of beta TCP is that the dissolving process is biologically determined owing to the essential role of macrophages, so that there is no certainty as to the eventual disappearance of the implant. Calcium sulphate, too, has a disadvantage its rate of dissolution is so high that the implant is not always replaced by bone tissue, which may leave a void Frame, J. Dent., 3, 177, 1975 . One advantage, compared with beta whitlockite, is that the dissolving process is a truly physicochemical, and hence predictable one. The present invention provides a three component system which 1 unlike the beta whitlockite described earlier, is dissolved not via disintegration into small particles, and hence without involving macrophagical removal and 2 is not dissolved as fast as gypsum, so that bone voids may be left. A third unique property 3 of the system is that the rate of decomposition of the implant is correlated to the rate of release of the medicine, so that a pre programmed dosage is possible, in contrast to the earlier described systems. The invention is characterized by being a three component system comprising a powdered gypsum product CaSO4 H2o , a a powdered calcium carbonate CaC03 , and a medicine. After mixing, the required amount of water is added at least 20 of the gypsum content whereby a dense final product is formed. Calcium carbonate has been chosen because, unlike gypsum which, depending of course on the size of the implant, has disappeared in several weeks requires several months for resorption see, for example, Patel, in Revue du Palais de la Decouverte, 10, 18 23, 1981 . Both calcium carbonate and gypsum are much more soluble than beta TCP, so that both materials have a physico chemical dissolving process without cellular interaction. To produce a good final product, at least 30 of gypsum is needed, otherwise it sets insufficiently when mixed with water. Variation of the gypsum to calcium carbonate ratio from 1.0 to 0.3 gives a variation in rate of decomposition from several weeks to several months. As the products are not porous, the release of medicine can be controlled by means of the rate of dissolution of the system. There is no diffusion from pores, which do not exist .
