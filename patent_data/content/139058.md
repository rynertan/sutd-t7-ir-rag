## Description
DESCRIPTION IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO WAREHOUSES . This invention relates to warehouses arranged for the mechanised stacking o Loads thereinto and the mechanised retrieval of loads therefrom. More particularly, the invention relates to a warehouse for the mechanised stacking and retrieval of long, thin, loads, such as rolls of carpeting, or bar, rod and tube stock. Hitherto such long, thin, loads have usually been accommodated in warehouses using an arrangement whereby they are stacked or retrieved by movement in a direction parallel to the major axis of the long, thin, load. Such an arrangement requires the availability of a clear space for the stacking or retrieving machinery approximating to the space occupied by the racks adjacent the feed and retrieval face of the racks. According to the present invention there is provided a warehouse arranged for the mechanised stacking of long, thin, loads thereinto and the mechanised retrieval of such long, thin, loads therefrom including a multiplicity of racks, each rack including an array of vertically spaced, horizontally extending, bays and running on a first set of spaced rails extending below base portions of the racks and each rack being formed at the base portion thereof with a spaced framework providing a free space sufficient to permit the passage of the loads, a gantry crane running on a second set of rails disposed parallel to, but outwardly of, the first set of rails and carrying a carriage movable vertically between a position in register with the spaced framework of each rack and a position clear above upper extremities of the racks with intermediate positions in register with the individual bays, extendable and retractable transfer arms arranged to transfer loads from and to the carriage, conveyor means extending through the spaced framework of the racks to transfer loads through the respective free spaces of the racks, the racks being positionable in contiguous relationship on the first set of rails and movable to space apart, and form a gap between, adjacent racks to permit movement of the carriage of the crane gantry therebetween. The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying, partly diagrammatic, drawings, in which Figure 1 is a sectional plan view of a warehouse Figure 2 is an end elevation of the warehouse with walls omitted and Figure 3 is a side elevation of the warehouse with walls omitted. As shown, the warehouse 2 has an elongate plan form with shorter walls 4 having a dimension slightly more than the maximum longitudinal length of long, thin, loads 6 to be stored and longer walls 8 having a dimension slightly more than the combined depths of contiguous racks 10 for storage of the long, thin, loads. The racks 10 run on a first set of rails 12 extending parallel to and adjacent the two longer walls 8 of the warehouse structure. Each rack 10 has a framework 14 mounted on a pair of trolleys 16 having wheels 18 running on the respective rails 12. The framework 14 is formed by short upright posts 20 extending from the trolleys 16, a base cross brace 22 extending horizontally between the trolleys and an intermediate cross brace 24 extending horizontally between the upper ends of the short upright posts 20. Three longer upright posts 26 mounted on the intermediate cross brace 24 extend upwardly to a top cross brace 28 extending horizontally therebetween. A series of shelves or bays 30 are positioned to extend horizontally to one side on the longer upright posts 26 between the intermediate cross brace 24 and the top cross brace 28 and further serve to strengthen the structure.In an alternative arrangement, not shown, the shelves may be positioned to both sides of the upright posts 26. Inclined braces 32 extend from the upper ends of the short upright posts 20 to intermediate portions of the outer longer upright posts 26. A travelling gantry crane 34 includes a pair of trolley sets 36 each having wheels 38 running on a second set of rails 40 positioned intermediate the first set of rails 12 and the longer walls 8 of the warehouse. A frame legs 42 extend upwardly from the trolley sets 36 to a cross beam 44 at a level above the uppermost portions of the racks 10. A carriage 46 slung from the cross beam 44 and steadied on guide rails 48 on the A frames carries extendable and retractable transfer arms 50. A raising and lowering mechanism 52 includes an electric motor 54 driving shafts 56 connected to cable drums 58 which carry cables 60 to effect movement of the carriage 46 between a position adjacent the level of the base cross braces 22 on the racks 10 and an uppermost position adjacent the upper cross beam 44 of the crane above the level of the uppermost portions of the racks. An endless conveyor 62 extends the length of the warehouse, passing over, and, if necessary, freely supported on, the base cross braces 22 of the racks 10. Drive means not shown are provided for the racks 10 and for the travelling gantry crane 34 on the respective first and second sets of rails 12, 40. In operation, the racks 10 are positioned contiguously on the first set of rails 12 and the travelling gantry crane 34 is positioned on the second set of rails 40. To insert a long, thin, load 6 into the warehouse 2, the load 6 is first deposited at an infeed station 64 of the conveyor 62 extending over the base cross braces 22 of the racks 10 with the longitudinal axis thereof perpendicular to the direction of movement of the conveyor. A receiving shelf 30 on one of the racks 10 is then selected and the rack drive means energised to move the racks along the first set of rails 12 to space the selected shelf and rack from the facing adjacent rack.The drive means for the crane 34 is then energised to cause the crane to travel into register with the spacing formed adjacent the selected shelf and drive means not shown for the conveyor 62 energised to transport the load to a pick and deposit station at a position subjacent the selected shelf. The lowering mechanism 52 of the carriage 46 is then actuated to lower the carriage to the level of the conveyor and the extendable and retractable transfer arms 50 are moved to the extended position to engage the load. The arms 50 are then retracted to position the load on the carriage 46, the carriage raised to a level corresponding to the selected shelf 30 and the arms extended to deposit the load on the shelf. Finally, the arms 50 are retracted and the carriage 46 either moved to commence another sequence in the same spacing or raised to its uppermost position pending the next sequence. To remove a selected load 6, a similar procedure is followed. The respective racks 10 are moved apart on the first set of rails 12 to produce a spacing between the racks adjacent the shelf with the selected load, the travelling gantry crane 34 is moved on the second set of rails 40 into register with the spacing formed between the racks and the carriage 46 lowered to the level of the selected load. The arms 50 are then extended to engage the load and retracted to place the load on the carriage 46, which is then lowered to the level of the conveyor 62, and the arms extended to transfer the load from the carriage to the conveyor at the pick and deposit station at a position subjacent the shelf on which the selected load was stored.The conveyor 62 is then energised to transport the load to an out feed station 66 thereof and the carriage either moved to commence another sequence in the same spacing or raised to the uppermost position to await the next sequence, the arms 50 first having been retracted. Whilst the drives to the conveyor 62, the racks 10, the crane 34, the carriage 46 and the arms 50 may be individually manually controlled, a sequential control system linked to a computerised memory may, with advantage, be utilised. Such a system would activate the various load transfer steps in sequence and would provide a record of the occupancy of the shelves 30. With a suitable program the system can be utilised, say overnight, to re arrange loads 6 on the racks 10 to group together loads required to fulfil specific orders, thereby facilitating transfer of the loads from the warehouse. The length of the first set of rails 12 is sufficient just to accommodate the racks 10 and a gap to permit operation of the carriage 46 of the crane 34. The conveyor 62 may be arranged with the infeed station 64 at one end and the outfeed station 66 at the other, or the two stations may be combined at one end. In the arrangement in which shelves 30 are positioned at both sides of the upright posts 26 of the racks 10 the carriage 46 of the crane 34 is provided with transfer arms 50 extendable and retractable to both sides of the carriage. It will be appreciated that the arrangements described show an economy in requirements for availability of clear space to permit stacking and retrieval of long, thin, loads compared with previous arrangements.
