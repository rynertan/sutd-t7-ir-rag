# Light emitting semiconductor device.

## Abstract
Herein disclosed is a high efficient light emitting semiconductor device which is operable stably at high speed and with a low threshold current. The light emitting double heterojunction semiconductor device of injection type comprises a first semiconductor layer of a first conductive type a second semiconductor layer of a second conductive type which is different from the first conductive type an active layer composed of laminated semiconductor layers of the quantum well structure interposed between the first and second semiconductor layers and having a narrower effective energy band gap than those of the first and second semiconductor layers and aa diffraction grating formed in either one of the first and second semiconductor layers.
