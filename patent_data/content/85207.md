The refractory oxide support material and the halogen free metal derivative are brought together in step A of the present invention in any desired manner. If the halogen free metal derivative is a solid it is preferred to dissolve the solid in a suitable inert liquid diluent and to mix the solution with the refractory oxide and evaporate the diluent prior to or during the heating in step A.

Preferably the mixture of refractory oxide support material and halogen free metal derivative are fluidised by inert gas or air during tne heating in step A. The product from step A in the present invention is then reacted with the organometallic compound defined in step B.

The reaction between the organometallic compound and the product from step A can be conducted in any desired manner provided tat the reaction mixture is substantially free from water and other impurities containing reactive groups which react with the organometallic compound.The reaction can be conducted in the present of an inert diluent or solvent for the organometallic compound if desired. Examples of suitable solvents are liquid hydrocarbons, for example, cyclohexane or normal hexane. The reaction is preferably carried out in a solvent at a temperature between ambient and the boiling point of the solvent, for example at a temperature in the range 10 800C, although temperatures above or below this range can be employed if desired. The reaction between the organometallic compound and the product from step A generally occurs rapidly at ambient temperature and a reaction time of one hour or less is normally adequate although longer times can be employed if desired. After the reaction between the organometallic compound and the product from step A is substantially complete, the unadsorbed organometallic compound, if any, can be separated from the solid product from step B if desired. The separation can be achieved, for example, by washing the solid product with an anhydrous inert solvent, for example, cyclohexane, normal hexane or petroleum ether.

In step C the solid product is impregnated with one or more halogen containing transition metal compounds wherein the transition metal or metals comprise titanium, vanadium or zirconium.The titanium or zirconium is preferably tetravalent and the vanadium is preferably tetra or penta valent. Preferably these compounds are selected from compounds having the general formulae DY, DOY 2 andD ORÃª sYp s wherein D is the titanium, vanadium or zirconium Y is halogen, preferably chlorine 0 is oxygen R2 is a hydrocarbyl group, for example alkyl, aryl or cycloalkyl preferably containing 1 10 carbon atoms p is the valency of D and s is an integer from 1 to p i.Examples of suitable titanium compounds are titanium tetrachloride, trichlorotitanium ethylate, dichlorotitanium diisopropylate and titanium oxychloride. Examples of suitable vanadium compounds are vanadyl chloride and vanadium tetrachloride. Examples of suitable zirconium compounds are zirconium tetrachloride and zirconyl chloride.Titanium tetrachloride and vanadyl chloride or mixtures thereof are preferred. The quantity of transition metal compound employed in preparing the catalyst of the present invention is suitably 0.05 to 10 moles, preferably 0.1 to 1.5 moles, most preferably 0.4 to 1.0 moles per mole of hydroxyl groups in the original support material. srnen a mixture of titanium and vanadium compounds is employed in step C of the present invention, preferably the atomic ratio of Ti V used in the catalyst preparation is in the range 100 1 to 1 100, most preferably 10 1 to 1 10. The impregnation can be carried out using the neat undiluted transition metal compounds or by dissolving the transition metal compound s in an inert solvent, for example a liquid hydrocarbon solvent. The inert solvent when used must be free from functional groups capable of reacting with the solid material obtained from stepB and the transition metal compound s . Cyclohexane is an example of a suitable inert solvent. The impregnation step is preferably carried out by contacting the solid material obtained from step B with the transition metal compound s at a temperature in the range 10 to L500C. It is particularly preferred to carry out the impregnation by stirring the mixture of said solid material and transition metal compound s in an inert solvent at a temperature in the range 10 to 300C. The contacting in the impregnation step C is preferably carried out for a time in the range 10 minutes to 24 hours. The catalyst obtained from step C is preferably separated from any unabsorbed transition metal compound by conventional means, for example, washing with dry inert solvent, or, if volatile transition metal compound s have been employed, by purging with inert gas, e.g. nitrogen, helium or argon. Preferably the separation is carried out by washing the catalyst several times with aliquots of dry hydrocarbon solvent.The catalyst may be stored as the dry material in a suitable nonreactive atmosphere, e.g. argon, nitrogen or other inert gas, or as a slurry in inert solvent. The present invention further comprises a process for polymerising one or more 1 olefins comprising contacting the monomer under polymerisation conditions with the catalyst of the present invention, preferably in the presence of a Ziegler catalyst activator. Ziegler catalyst activators and the methods in which they are used to activate Ziegler catalysts are well known. Ziegler catalyst activators are organomelallic derivatives or hydrides of metals of Groups 1, II, III, arid XV of the Pr3odic Tall. . Particularly preferred are trialkyl aluminium compounds or alkylaluminium halides, for example triethylaluminium, tributylaluminium and diethylaluminium chloride.When a Ziegler catalyst activator is employed, preferably it is present in an amount such that the atomic ratio of metal atoms in the activator total transition metal supported on the catalyst support is not greater than 1O . The polymerisation process of the present invention can be applied to the homopolymerisation of l olefins, e.g. ethylene or propylene, or to the copolymerisation of mixtures of l olefins, e.g. ethylene with propylene, l butene, l pentene, l hexene, 4 methylpentene l, 1,3 butadiene or isoprene. The process is particularly suitable for the homopolymerisation of ethylene or the copolymerisation of ethylene with up to 40 weight based on total monomer of comonomers. The polymerisation conditions can be in accordance with known techniques used in supported Ziegler polymerisation. The polymerisation can be carried out in the gaseous phase or in the presence of a dispersion medium in which the monomer is soluble. As a liquid dispersion medium, use can be made of an inert hydrocarbon which is liquid under the polymerisation conditions or of the monomer or monomers themselves maintained in the liquid state under their saturation pressure. The polymerisation can if desired be carried out in the presence of hydrogen gas or other chain transfer agent to vary the molecular weight of the produced polymer. The polymerisation is preferably carried out under conditions such that the polymer is formed as solid particles suspended in a liquid diluent. Generally the diluent is selected from paraffins and cycloparaffins having from 3 30 carbon atoms per molecule.Suitable diluents include for example isopentane, isobutane, and cyclohexane. Isobutane is preferred. Methods of recovering the product polyolefin are well known in the art. The polymerisation catalyst of the present invention can be used to make high density ethylene polymers and copolymers at high productivity having properties which render them suitable for a variety of applications. The catalyst exhibits good hydrogen sensitivity, i.e. the melt index of the produced polyolefins can be varied widely by employing hydrogen at different concentrations as chain transfer agent in the polymerisation process. The invention is further illustrated by the following Examples. In the Examples the melt index MI2 and high load melt 2.16 index MI21.6 were determined according to ASTM method D 1238 conditions E and F respectively the units are grams per 10 minutes. Kd is a numerical measure of the molecular weight distribution of the polymer and is determined by a method similar to that disclosed in Sabia, R., J. Appl. Polymer Sci., 1963, 7, 347.Example 1 Catalyst Preparation In step A of the catalyst preparation, silica Davison 951 grade, 35g was slurried in petroleum ether 40 600C boiling range, 250 ml in a nitrogen purged flask and titanium tetraisopropylate 10.6 ml added.
