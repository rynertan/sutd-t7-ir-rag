# Rubber metal composites.

## Abstract
The bond strength between a sulphur vulcanisable rubber and a metal, especially brass, is increased by using as bonding promoter an organic substance containing one or more groups of the formula S SOâ‚‚R where R represents a a radical OM where M is a monovalent metal, the equivalent of a multivalent metal, a monovalent ion derived by the addition of a proton to a nitrogenous base or the equivalent of a multivalent ion derived by the addition of two or more protons to a nitrogenous base, or b an organic radical. Preferred promoters include sodium, zinc, nickel and cobalt organothiosulphates.
