# Method of obtaining derivatives of 4 beta 1 alken 1 yl 2 xi, 5 alpha dihydroxy 3,3a beta, 4,5,6,6a beta hexahydro 2H cyclopenta b furane, and sulphonyl derivatives of 2H cyclopenta b furane

## Abstract
A new method has been developed for obtaining derivatives of 4β 1 alken 1 yl 2, 5α dihydroxy 3,3aβ,4,5,6,6aβ hexahydro 2H cyclopenta b furane useful in the synthesis of prostaglandis of their analogs, and a method for obtaining new sulphonyl starting compounds of the general formula 4, in which Z denotes a hydrogen atom or a protective group, Y denotes a group of the formula CHOZ¹, in which Z¹ has the meaning stated for Z, whereby protective groups Z and Z¹ may be the same or different, and Ar denotes optionally a substituted aryl group. In the method according to the invention the new sulphonyl derivative of the general formula 4 is alkylated with an electrophilic agent comprising carbonyl derivatives, oxiranes and halohydrins or their derivatives the alkylation product is transformed into derivatives of 4β l alken 1 yl 2, 5α dihydroxy 3,3aβ,4,5,6,6aβ hexahydro 2H cyclopenta b furane in reactions which ensure obtaining a double bond C₁₃ C₁₄. New sulphonyl initial compounds of the general formula 4 are obtained from lactone of the general formula II, in which Z has the above stated meaning and L denotes a leaving group, which is transformed into a sulphide the obtained lactone sulphide is reduced to lactol, and thereafter lactol sulphide is oxidized to the sulphonyl derivative.
