# Production of high strength polyethylene filaments.

## Abstract
Production of polyethylene filaments of tenacity at least 30g d from a hot, supersaturated solution of high viscosity polyethylene having intrinsic viscosity of at least 11 dl g, by contacting a length of such filament 11, 11a functioning as a seed simultaneously with a stationary arcuate surface 4 and with such polyethylene solution, and withdrawing the filament through the solution in sliding contact around the surface at a rate reaching at least 80 cm per minute thereby producing tension and inducing crystal growth from the solution onto the filament, with increase of tension up to a steady state tension of at least 70 grams. More particularly the polyethylene has intrinsic viscosity of 17 28 dl g, the solvent is xylene, the surface is composed of PTFE, the polyethylene concentration is 0.1 to 0.5 wgt. percent, the rate of withdrawing the filament is at least 200 cm per minute, and the polyethylene seed filament is initially led around the arcuate surface by attaching the filament to an endless loop 10 which is drawn through the solution and around the surface and then the seed filament is passed to a takeup reel 12 , and afterward when the tension has reached at least 70g the seed filament is severed from its supply source while growth of the product filament on the seed filament and from the end thereof proceeds.
