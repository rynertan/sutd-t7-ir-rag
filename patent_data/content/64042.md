# Programmable signal processing device.

## Abstract
Programmable signal processing device mainly intended for hearing aids and of the kind which includes an electronically controlled signal processor, the device being able to select a number of different signal processes to suit different sound situations automatically or by the user himself. This is accom plished by a memory 6 arranged to store information data for at least two unique signal processes adjusted to different sound environment listening situations and a control unit 5 , manual or automatic, arranged to transmit information data for one of the unique signal processes from the memory 6 to the signal processor 4 to bring about one signal process adjusted to a particular sound environment listening situation.
