# AUTOMATIC SURFACE DRESSING MACHINE

## Abstract
Disclosed is an automatic apparatus for removing a surface layer of predetermined thickness from objects of varying curvilinear contour advancing past a multiplicity of floatingly supported power driven dressing rollers position able automatically by the changing contour of the objects. The combined width of the object being dressed and the dressing rollers are so distributed that each dresses only a separate strip. Uniformity of strip thickness is achieved, in part, by controlling the pressure of the dressing rollers against the object and, in part, by utilizing a shoe beside the dressing rollers effective to limit the thickness of the dressed layer and to tilt the axis of the rollers in either direction in response to the changing transverse contour of the object. Cuttings are removed by suction air flowing past each dressing roller. When the apparatus is used to dress fish fillets or other skin bearing edibles, one or more surface grooving, scraping and loosening auxiliaries maybe located in the path of advance and used advantageousy.
