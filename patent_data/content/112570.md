# SYSTEM FOR CONTROLLING MANUFACTURING PROCESS IN AN INDUSTRY FOR MANUFACTURING VARIOUS MODELS, TYPES AND OR SPECIFICATIONS OF PRODUCTS IN A COMMON LINE BY MEANS OF A BAR CODE LABEL WITH SLOTTED BAR CODE AND CONTROLLING METHOD THEREFOR

## Abstract
A bar code control for a manufacturing process employs a bar code label with a combination of narrow and wide slots constituting a bar code in combination. The bar code label is attached to a base component to which various other compo nents are to be assembled in an assembly process and a pain ting process. In the assembly process, information and in structions represented by the bar code are optically read to identify the components to be assembled to the base compo nent and to control the assembly operations. In the painting process, the bar code is read to identify the required color to be painted and to control the painting operation.
