# PEPTIDES USEFUL IN VACCINATION AGAINST ENTEROVIRUSES

## Abstract
A synthetic peptide, suitable for use in vaccination against or diagnosis of a disease caused by an enterovirus and especially by a poliovirus, is the peptide coded for by codons 286 288 or 288 290 in the RNA sequence coding for the structural capsid protein VP1 of poliovirus type 3 Sabin strain or by equivalent codons of another enterovirus or is an antigenic equivalent thereof, the numbers of the codons being counted from the 5 terminus of the nucleotide sequence coding for the VP1 capsid protein.
