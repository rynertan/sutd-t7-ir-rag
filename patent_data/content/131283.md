# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ANCHORING OPTICAL CABLES TO OPTICAL CONNECTORS

## Abstract
An anchoring system for optical cables 18 having lon gitudinally running strength members 22 includes a retainer 16 which slips over the outside shield of the cable, in which the retainer has longitudinally running grooves 30 into which the strength members 22 are reverse bent. The lon gitudinally running grooves 30 in the retainer 16 , in one embodiment, have a depth less than the thickness of the strength members 22 such that when the retainer is inserted into a cap 14 , the side walls of the cap compress the strength members 22 into their respective grooves 30 . In one embodiment the retainer 16 has an annular lip 32 running about its exterior surface which serves to hold the retainer in the cap 14 when the retainer 16 is snapped into place in the cap.
