# Method of manufacturing T 3 grade low temper blackplates.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing T 3 grade low temper blackplates having an excellent corrosion resistance by continuous annealing process is disclosed. In this method, after a continuously cast slab of low carbon aluminum killed steel consisting of 0.02 0.09 of C, not more than 0.04 of Si, 0.15 0.40 of Mn, 0.003 0.02 of soluble Aâ„“, not more than 0.0040 in total of N and the balance of Fe and inevitable impurities is subjected to hot rolling, coiled at a temperature of less than 580 C, pickled and subjected to cold rolling, the resulting cold rolled strip is subjected to such a continuous annealing that the strip is maintained at a temperature above 680 C for at least 20 seconds, quenched up to a temperature below 500 C at a cooling rate of 10 500 C sec, maintained at a temperature of 350 500 C for at least 20 seconds and cooled to room temperature.
