# A data processing system for optimising a machine code instruction stream.

## Abstract
A method operable within an optimising compiler to move certain range check instructions out of single entry strongly connected regions or loops and into linear regions of the instruction stream whereby computational efficiency is increased with no loss of program accuracy. The method comprises placing a range check trap instruction into the head node of the SCR provided there is only one conditional exit from the SCR, modifying the conditional exit test based on the value of the induction variable v, and inserting a new check at the loop exit point s to insure that the induction variable has reached the value it would have obtained in the original unmodified program.

## Description
This invention relates to a data processing system which performs a compiling operation on an instruction stream of a high level computer language and produces a machine code instruction set. This operation is normally called compiling and the control program that is used to control the operation of the data processing system is called a compiler. The present invention has particular utility in a compiler in which optimisation algorithms are used to improve the quality of the code, and in which the compiler automatically inserts code to perform range checking. In particular, this invention makes it possible to reduce the amount of range checking which must be performed during the execution of object programs, and in some cases, it makes it possible to remove the range checking code entirely, when the optimisation routines determine that the variables whose ranges are being checked do not fall outside the prescribed ranges. While the invention will find utility in optimisation compilers for all types of computers, it has particular significance for reduced instruction set computers, for which the code produced by compilers is often more voluminous than code produced for complex instruction of a reduced instruction set computer is simpler and performs less function. Furthermore, in a reduced instruction set computers, there is often less memory protection hardware built into the computer. To preserve integrity of memory, compilers for such reduced instruction set computers insert code to guarantee that addressing remains within prescribed areas. Such code can be optimised by this invention, and thereby reduces the cost of software memory protection. The quality of code produced by compilers has been an issue ever since the first compiler was produced. One of the principal objectives of IBM s FORTRAN I compiler, the first commercially available compiler, was to produce object code in the field of scientific computation which was comparable in code quality to that produced by assembly language programmers. Today, higher level languages are designed to be used in every field in which computers are applicable. Even the original FORTRAN language has been bolstered to make it applicable to a wide range of programming tasks. However, it is still important that the quality of code produced by the compiler be high, especially if the resultant code is to be used in a production environment. Code produced by a skilled assembly language programmer is still the yardstick against which compiler produced code is measured. A large number of optimisation techniques have been developed and refined since the 1950 s to improve the quality of compiler generated code. Indeed, many of these optimisations were known in principle, and used in some fashion by the team that produced the first FORTRAN compiler. Optimisations that are frequently employed in optimising compilers include common subexpression elimination, moving code from regions of high execution frequency to regions of low execution frequency code motion , dead code elimination, reduction in strength replacing a slow operation by an equivalent fast operation , and constant propagation. Descriptions of these optimisations can be found in J T Schwartz, On programming An Interim Report on the SETL Language. Installment II The SETL Language and Examples of Its Use.

The optimisation of range checking is a relatively new notion, and is not dealt with in the above mentioned references. The general concepts have been previously published in the following paper on the Optimisation of Range Checking. However, it has since been discovered that the range checking optimisation disclosed in that paper is seriously flawed in that it causes the optimisation to generate incorrect code in certain instances of control flow. The present invention overcomes the defect in the published paper. The specific reference to this prior paper is V Markstein, J Cocke and P Markstein, Optimisation of Range Checking, Proc. of the SIGPLAN 1982 Symposium on Compiler Construction, pp 114 119, ACM Order Number 548820, Baltimore, MD. Other references which deal specifically with range checking, or analysis or ranges of variables are W Harrison, Compiler Analysis of the Value Ranges for Variables, IEEE Transactions of Software Engineering, May 1974 pp 243 250. J Welsh, Economic Range Checks in Pascal, Software Practice an Experience, 1978 Vol. 8, pp 85 91. Harrison s paper does not touch on the subject of optimising range checks. He does describe range analysis, which is one of the techniques which this invention employs to achieve its goals. Harrison s range analysis is more complex than the present method and it is able to perform range analysis in more complex situations than attempted here. If Harrison s range analysis technique were to be combined with the present invention, the result would be a range check optimisation technique which is more powerful than the one described here albeit much more complex and difficult to implement. Welsh s technique for range check optimisation depends strongly on the nature of data structure declarations in the PASCAL programming language, and the inclusion of assertions in the programming language. His range check optimisation can be carried out during syntactic and semantic analysis. It cannot cope with as general control flow situations as the present invention. It is a primary object of the invention to provide a method operable within an optimising compiler for removing range check computations from a single entry strongly connected region in the instruction stream when the range check instruction contains a comparand that is linearly related to the induction variable which controls whether control remains in the SCR. It is a further object to provide such a method which also places in the head node of the single entry strongly connected region a range check instruction to determine whether the range check would have failed during the first iteration. It is another object to provide such a method which ascertains that the SCR has been executed the correct number of times, by determining if the induction variable has attained its expected final value. It is another object to provide such a method which produces correct optimised code in the situation where the only exit from a strongly connected region is a conditional exit based on a test of the induction variable. It is yet another object to provide such a method which produces correct optimised code in the situation where there is one conditional exit based on a test of the induction variable, and there are additional conditional exits none of which involve the induction variable. These additional conditional exits may occur anywhere in the strongly connected region. It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a method operable within an optimising compiler which moves certain range check instructions out of single entry strongly connected regions or loops and into linear regions of the instruction stream whereby computational efficiency is increased with no loss of program accuracy. According to the invention there is provided a data processing system which performs a compiling operation on an instruction stream of a high level computer language and produces a machine code instruction stream, the control system of the data processing system including optimising means to produce an optimal machine code instruction stream, characterised in that the optimising means is arranged to perform the following method and in operable to move certain range check instructions out of single entry strongly connected regions SCR or loops and into linear regions of the instruction stream whereby computational efficiency is increased with no loss of program accuracy, said method comprising placing a range check trap instruction into the header node of the SCR provided there is only one conditional exit from the SCR based on the induction variable, and additional conditional exits none of which are based on the induction variable, modifying the conditional exit test based on the value of the induction variable v , and inserting additional checks at the loop exit point s to insure that the induction variable has reached the value it would have obtained in the original unmodified program. Broadly, the method comprises placing a range check trap instruction into the header node of the SCR provided there is only one conditional exit from the SCR, modifying the conditional exit test based on the value of the induction variable v, and inserting a new check s at the loop exit point s to insure that the induction variable has reached the value it would have obtained in the original unmodified program. In order that the invention may be fully understood it will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which To facilitate the following description of the present invention, the range check optimisation advocated in the above referenced paper by Markstein, Cocke and Markstein will first be described. To facilitate the description, the following terminology will be defined. Subgraph The expression subgraph as used herein denotes a subset of the nodes of the overall flow graph of the program, and those edges of the flow graph which connect the nodes in the subset. Strongly Connected Region A subgraph in which there exits a path between any pair of nodes in the subgraph using only edges of the subgraph. Single Entry Strongly Connected Region A strongly connected region in which there is only one node which has predecessors outside the strongly connected region. A single entry strongly connected region corresponds to the common programming notion of a loop. In the present description the acronym SCR is used to mean a single entry strongly connected region. USE Function The USE function for a program point P identifies all program points instructions where the object computed at P is used as an operand. DEF Function The DEF function for a program point P and an Operand O which is used at P is the set of all program points at which O is computed and from which program point P can be reached without passing through another computation of O. Region Constant A region constant, rc with respect to an SCR, is an object that is not computed in the SCR and is, the DEF function for rc includes no program points instructions in the SCR. Induction Variable An induction variable v for an SCR, is a variable which was only one program point within that SCR given by its DEF function, and the computation of v is of the form v v rc where rc is a region constant. Entry node The entry node of an SCR is the unique node within the SCR which has predecessors not contained in the SCR. Header node The header node of an SCR is the unique predecessor of the entry node which is not contained in the SCR. If an SCR does not contain a header node, the control flow graph can easily be modified to an equivalent control flow graph with a header node, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Articulation node An articulation node of a subgraph is a node which must be visited on every traversal of the subgraph. Trap instruction A trap instruction is an intermediate language instruction used to encode range checks. The trap instruction specified a relation R and two operands X and Y. If the relation X R Y is false, the program terminates because a range condition has been violated otherwise the program proceeds with the next sequential instruction. Traps may be realised in the final code by a conventional compare instruction followed by a conditional jump or call to an error routine. The objects of the present invention are accomplished in general by a procedure operable within an optimising compiler for removing range checking trap instructions from program loops and placing said instructions in linear portions of the instruction stream whereby the frequency of execution will be greatly reduced thus resulting in significant improvements in the efficiency of the execution of the resultant compiled program. More particularly, the procedure involves properly recoding the program where the loop is characterised by a conditional exit based on an induction variable v followed by a conditional exit not based on the induction variable. The procedure includes identifying the single entry strongly connected region SCR or loop within an instruction stream having a trap instruction therein for the purpose of range checking, said trap instruction comparing v to a region constant. The induction variable v must meet three conditions If the path from C goes directly to the entry node or if there are no other conditional exits on the path from C to the entry node said second trap instruction must be inserted on the path from C that leaves the SCR which causes termination if the induction variable v does not meet the original condition C for loop exit. If there is another conditional exit on the path from C to the entry node a further conditional branch must be placed on the exit path, said conditional branch leading directly to the exit point if v meets the original loop exit condition C. On the exit path a copy the code inside the loop which can be reached along any path from C to the entry node, must be inserted, but every copied branch or conditional branch which has the entry node as a target must be altered to branch instead to a trap instruction which is guaranteed to cause program termination. Range checks encoded as traps in an SCR could be removed by the following process, if there is a conditional exit from the SCR based on the value of an induction variable v. Suppose that there is a trap in the SCR in which one of the operands is the induction variable v, or a linear function of the induction variable, and that the trap occurs in an articulation node. Then the trap can be eliminated from within the SCR provided certain operations occur Similar transformations may readily be performed for other combinations of relations in the trap and loop closings, as will be evident to those skilled in the art. One trivial variation could be as follows Step 4 An additional check must be inserted at the loop exit point s to insure that the induction variable has reached the value it would have obtained in the original program, that is, before the above mentioned modification was made. For the situation cited in the previous step, the check would be if v m then abort. To see that the transformed program is equivalent to the original program, if the original program would have failed the range check in the first iteration, then the transformed program fails the range check inserted into the header node, the original program would have failed the range check on the first iteration since the range check in the original program is in an articulation node. The transformed program can only trap thereafter on the range check inserted at the loop exit point. But such a trap indicates that the induction variable did not reach its expected final value. In the original program, additional iterations of the loop would have occurred, one of which would have caused the range check to fail. The Markstein, Cocke and Markstein paper describes how to modify the conditional exit, and how to insert the new check at program exit. Thus at the cost of performing one trap prior to entering a loop, and one trap after exiting from that loop, the trap within the loop which is a region of high execution frequency can be removed. The paper, on pp 116 117, observes that if there are exits from the SCR which are independent of the induction variable, then these exits have no effect on the analysis. For flow graphs such as the ones shown in FIG. 3, the observation is correct. These flow graphs are characterised by additional loop exists, but whether or not to take these exits does not involve the induction variable. Furthermore, these exit decisions occur during a loop traversal before the exit decision based on the induction variable is encountered. However, loop exits not based on the induction variable that occur on control flow paths between the loop exit based on the induction variable and the SCR entry node were not considered. Fig. 5 characterises this situation. Suppose that the trap occurs in block 1 and that the induction variable is tested in block 2. If the induction variable has attained a certain value, control leaves the SCR and flows to block 4. The paper s algorithm directs altering the test in block 2 to guarantee that the range check in block 1 cannot cause termination. This is still correct. However, the last of the steps outlined above requires that on the path from block 2 to block 4, a test be inserted that the induction variable attained the value it would have attained had the test in block 2 not been changed. This is correct only if the test on the induction variable were not followed by other tests which lead to loop exit. In a SCR such as depicted in Fig. 5, the test in block 3 may have caused an exit from the loop event before the induction variable attained its intended value. Thus, a situation can arise in which the induction variable has attained a value large enough to cause the range check to fail on the next iteration, but not large enough to reach its intended final value. The inserted test on the path from block 2 to block 4 in Fig. 6 would then indicate that in the unmodified program, a trap would have occurred in the loop. However, in the unmodified program, it could have been the case that even though the induction variable has become out of range for the next iteration of the loop, the additional loop exit condition in block 3 prevents the next iteration from occurring. Therefore, it may be the case that the inserted test on the path from block 2 to block 4 incorrectly indicates that a trap would have occurred in the original program. Fig. 1 illustrates the simplest SCR. The Markstein, Cocke and Markstein paper correctly describes how to process such a flow graph, and Fig. 2 shows the result of range check optimisation following the procedures described in the paper. The present invention correctly performs trap optimisation, following the overall scheme given in the Markstein, Cocke and Markstein paper referenced above except for a modification to Step 4, described above in the Prior Art section. According to the present invention, the original Step 4 repeated below for convenience of reference disclosed in the referenced article is modified as follows Old Step 4 An additional check must be inserted at the loop exit point s to insure that the induction variable has reached the value it would have obtained in the original program, that is, before the above mentioned modification was made. For the situation cited in the previous step step 3 of the example described previously the check would be if v m then abort. New Step 4 On the path from the conditional exit based on the induction variable, to the node outside the SCR, a test must be placed to insure that the induction variable has reached the value it would have obtained in the original program, provided that there are no other tests between the conditional exit and the entry block of the SCR. If the induction variable has not attained its expected final value, it is because the modified conditional exit instruction prevented iteration, since on the next iteration, the trap instruction would have caused program termination because of range check violation. If there are other conditional exits between the conditional exit and the entry block of the SCR, two items must be added along the exit path from the conditional exit based on the induction variable, and the exit node. First a test is inserted to ascertain whether the induction variable had attained its expected value. Node 3 in Fig. 7. That is, if v attained the expected value, the original program would have branched to the exit node, and so should the modified program. Second, the subgraph between the conditional exit based on the induction variable and the entry node must be copied along the exit path. This is needed because a loop exit might occur in the original program from one of the other conditional exits before the induction variable has attained its final value. Node 3 in Fig. 7. However, where in the original graph, an edge would lead to the entry node, in the copied graph, the edge must lead to program termination that is to say, an attempt in the copied code to return to the loop must indicate a range check in the next iteration of the loop. Node 3 in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 illustrates how the flow graph in Fig. 5 must be modified when range check optimisation is performed. The preceding description of the invention referring to Figs. 1 through 7 is believed to fully and completely describe the present invention in sufficient detail to allow skilled programmers to incorporate the concepts disclosed herein in an appropriate optimising compiler. Figs 1 through 7 are examples to which the present invention applies. These figures also show how the examples are transformed by the invention. Figs. 8 through 11 are more conventional flow charts which will specify the detailed operations necessary in practising the invention to a greater level of particularity. In these figures, Fig. 8 is a high level flow chart of a conventional optimising compiler as is well known in the art. Blocks 1, 2 4 and 5 are quite straight forward and well known. Block 3 entitled, Code Optimisation, is the phase of the compiler activity to which the present invention applies and is represented in more detail in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 is a flow chart of the code optimisation phase for such an optimising compiler. The operations performed in blocks 1 and 4 are straight forward and well known in the art. Block 2 entitled, Global Common Subexpression Elimination and Code Motion, relates to an optimisation phase generally known in the art. However, for a specific reference to a particular method of achieving this form of optimisation, reference is made to copending application Serial No 640,283 entitled, Method for Improving Global Common Subexpression Elimination and Code Motion in an Optimising Compiler, of Auslander et al filed August 13, 1984. Block 3 entitled, Range Check Optimisation, is the specific area of the optimising compiler to which the present invention applies. This block is shown in expanded form in Figs. 10 and 11. The location block 3 shows where range optimisation should be performed relative to other optimisations. In the event that the actual values of region constants are known, it is possible to determine the results of some of the instructions which are inserted in the header node and exit nodes. This can lead to greatly simplified final code. It is the job of global constant propagation and dead code elimination block 4 to perform these simplifications. There is no attempt herein to incorporate constant propagation or dead code elimination into the present invention as indicated above as it would only tend to obfuscate the invention. Figure 10 comprises a high level flow chart for the range check optimisation feature of the present invention. Blocks 1 and 2 of the figure involve identifying and listing the SCRs and determining the USE and DEF functions. As will be well understood, these functions may be readily accomplished by examining, for example, a list of intermediate language instructions and looking at the nature of each instruction to determine where SCRs begin and end. The USE and DEF functions would be determined by examining the operands specified for the various instructions. As will be appreciated, these two functions could be accomplished early in the overall compiler flow or separately as indicated in block 3 of Fig. 9. Block 3 is merely a test to determine if all of the SCRs identified for particular program being compiled have been processed for possibilities of range check optimisation. As long as there is still an SCR candidate, the system would proceed to block 4 where the specific SCR would be removed from the list for processing. The first step of the processing is performed in block 5 where all articulation nodes of the SCR S are identified and marked. The system then proceeds to block 6 where a determination is made to ascertain whether or not S contains an induction variable v which meets three specified conditions which are necessary before the present invention can be applied. These three conditions are specified in block 6 of the drawing but are repeated here for convenience of reference. They are as follows If no such induction variable is found in S the system returns to block 3 and the next SCR is accessed. If the test in block 6 is positive, the system proceeds to block 7. This block determines whether or not there is a trap instruction T in one of the articulation nodes of S which compares v to a region constant. If not, again the system returns to block 3 since the present invention does not apply. If the test is positive, the system proceeds to block 8 which is shown in greater detail in Fig. 11. It should be clearly understood that the overall function of this block is to remove the trap instruction from the SCR, place the trap instruction from the SCR, place the trap instruction from the SCR, place the trap instruction in the header node thereof, and also to insert additional instructions where necessary in the exit from the SCR not in the loop to make sure that all specified conditions in the original program are adequately tested for. Referring to Fig. 11, this procedure becomes active when it is determined that a specific SCR has been found having a range check and induction variable meeting the requirements specified in Fig. 10 which lead the control flow to block 8 of Fig. 10 and thus block 1 of Fig. 11. In the sequence of Fig. 11, the specific details of modifying the originally programmed SCR S are set forth, as will be understood. The first operation that occurs is to copy the trap instruction T into the header node of S. Thus in Figs 2 , 4 and 7 which represent properly revised programs that instruction is shown as Range Check if v LIMIT then ABORT. Proceeding to block 2, this step ensures that the comparands of the conditional exit C based on the induction variable v are modified to ensure that the trap instruction T cannot cause termination of the program when control remains in the loop. As the loop is executed repeatedly, the induction variable increases, so that on a later execution of the loop, T might cause program termination of the program when control remains in the loop. As the loop is executed repeatedly, the induction variable increases, so that on a later execution of the loop, T might cause program termination. Block 2 modified the loop so that T cannot cause termination and thus justified the action of block 3. In the examples illustrated in Figs. 1, 3 and 5 this is accomplished by creating a new region constant t which is computed in the header node as shown in Figs. 2, 4 and 7 this new region constant is shown as t min m, LIMIT . Next in block 3 the trap instruction T is removed from S. The system then proceeds to block 4 in which a determination is made as to whether the program flow goes from the conditional exit C which remains in S directly to the entry node. The particular exit C to which this block applies is the one containing the induction variable v specified in the block 2. In the case of the examples of Figs 1 and 3 the path from C does go directly to the entry node. In this event the system branches to block 5. It will be noted that in the case of the example of Fig. 5, the program flow does not go from the conditional exit 2 back to the entry node 1 but instead proceeds to node 3 . The SCR present in the case of the example of Fig. 5 would cause the system to proceed to block 6. Considering first the possibility of the system proceeding to block 5, this block would cause a trap instruction to be inserted on the path from C that leaves S which will cause termination of the program if the induction variable v does not meet the original condition C for loop exit. In the case of the compiled programs shown in the examples of Figs. 2 and 4, this new range check is IF v m THEN ABORT . A stated previously this second range check, again out of the loop, assures against some programming error which would have caused the original to repeat the loop once more and on that next iteration, to have terminated as a result of the trap removed in block 3 of Fig. 10. Returning to block 6 of Fig. 11 a test is made to see if there are other additional exits on the path from C to the entry node. If there were other node operations in the return loop from the conditional exit to the entry node which were not conditional exits, the system would proceed back to block 5 as described above. However, in the case of the example of Fig. 5 which situation the present invention specifically applies the system would proceed to block 7. In this block a conditional branch is inserted on the exit path to the exit point if the induction variable v meets the original condition C for loop exit. This is represented by node 3 in Fig. 7. Program flow then proceeds to block 8. Code which can be reached from condition C to the entry node is inserted on the exit path. But where the original code provides paths to S s entry node, in the copied code, these paths must lead to program termination. The reason for this change to the copied code is that by having gotten onto the exit path by the modified conditional exit instruction C, it is known that a return to the header node will lead to program termination on the next iteration. But since the trap T has been removed from within the loop S, an alternate mechanism must be provided outside S for the purpose of terminating the program. While block 8 causes additional code to be inserted into the program, it should be remembered that this additional code is outside the strongly connected region S, and is only executed once each time the loop S is performed. On the other hand, the code in S is traversed several times so that removing the trap T from the interior of S will give a net performance improvement. Looking at Figs. 5 and 7 in Fig. 7, node 3 is a copy of node 3 of Fig. 5, but wherever an edge from 3 goes to the header node 1 in Fig. 5, the corresponding edge in Fig. 7 goes to a range check node 3 which is guaranteed to cause program termination.
