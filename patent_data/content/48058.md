# Process for the production of a plastic object.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for the production of an object from a granular ABS polymer composition, said composition comprising I. 10 100 parts by weight of one or more graft copolym ers obtained by polymerizing a mixture of one or more unsaturated nitriles and one or more vinylaromatic compounds in the presence of a rubber. II. 0 90 parts by weight of a copolymer of one or more unsaturated nitriles and one or more vinylaromatic compounds, and III. 0 20 parts by weight of one or more additives, wherein the polymer composition is melted, homogenized, and extruded or injection moulded into an object. To improve the flowproperties of the mixture introduced into the processing equipment and the throughput of this equipment the invention is characterized in that said granu lar composition has a particle size distribution with at least two peaks, and that the ratio between the diameters at said peaks exceeds 1.5.
