# Cross linked vinyl chloride polymer.

## Abstract
A cross linked vinyl chloride polymer comprising a vinyl chloride or a mixture of vinyl chloride with a monomer copolymerizable therewith and b a bisphenol modified diacrylate or dimethacrylate as a cross linking agent. The cross linked polymer has excellent heat stability and de lustering effect, and a composition containing the cross linked polymer as a resin component or containing it as a delustering agent for a thermoplastic resin can give with good processability a molded article having a delustered surface, a good uniformity in surface roughness, a good hand touchness and an excellent heat stability.
