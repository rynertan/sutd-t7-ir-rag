# ALPHA NUMERIC DISPLAY DEVICE AND VISUAL DISPLAY ARRANGEMENT EMPLOYING SUCH DEVICES

## Abstract
An alpha numeric display device comprises seven rows of five elements 1 35 in which each element 6 10 of the second row is connected to the corresponding element 11 15 in the third row so that a single signal controls both element. Similarly each element 21 25 in the fifth row is connected to the corresponding element 26 30 in the sixth row. In addition the second element 2 in the first tow may be conected 36 to the fourth element 4 in the first row. A full alpha numeric character set may be generated by appropriately energising selected elements. Since the dis play device effectively comprises either twenty four or twenty five elements rather than thirty five elements the number of electrical connections required is reduced. In addition the quantity of information required to be stored to drive the display is also reduced. The elements 1 35 may be formed as liquid crystal cells and a plurality of devices may be formed into a multi character display arrangement. When addressing the display devices in matrix form either a five row by five column matrix or two four row by three column matrices may be used depending on whether the link 36 between the second 2 and fourth 4 elements of the first row is provided.
