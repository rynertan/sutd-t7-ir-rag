## Description
FIELD OF TIIE INVENTION The present invention relates to a shaving composition, that is to say a composition which is applied to the face in order to soften the hair preparatory to application of a razor. In the past there have been available for this purpose soaps in the form of sticks or bowls adapted to be applied to the face as a lather with a brush. There have also been available creams adapted to be applied with a wet brush for the same purpose, called lather creams . There have also been available so called brushless shaving creams which are applied simply by hand. All of these compositions had little more effect or stated purpose than the mere wetting of the hair. The compositions applied with a brush are generally time consuming although more effective than the brushless creams, which suffer from the additional disadvantage that they are immiscible with water, resulting in clogging of the razor and difficulty in subsequent cleaning of the basin. SUM. RS OF TIRE INVENTON I have now found that surprising benefits can be obtained by the incorporation in a shaving composition of a betaine. The betaine should be of a cosmetically acceptable type, many examples of which are known and have been used for example in shampoos for ten years or more. Other uses to which betaines have been applied are soaps and detergents in general and fabric softeners.They are well known for their anti static properties and many of them have, to a greater or lesser extent, useful anti irritant properties, which accounts for their use particularly in shampoos. The particular properties which render them beneficial in shaving compositions are not clearly known. The use of an agent having anti static properties, while of obvious benefit in relation to the washing of hair of substantial length, would not appear prima facie to have a clear application to the treatment of stubble. It is believed however, that the anti static properties may contribute to some extent but that the particular action of the betaines on the roots of the hair provides the surprising ability for close shaving which is achieved through use of the invention. The invention is not however limited to the operation of any particular mechanism. The amount of betaine to be employed in the composition may in general vary from 0.1 to 10 per cent by weight, depending on the type of end product. For example 0.5 per cent is preferred for gel formulations to be described and 3 for cream formulations. Any of the betaines advocated for use in personal toilet soaps or shampoos are in general suitable. Many such compounds are disclosed, e.g. in the following British patent specifications 995,353 1,084,73 1,087,414 1,087,415 1,274,005 1,291,424 1,355,233. The word betaine is used herein to mean any zwitterionic quaternary ammonium compound having positive and negative charges which are internally neutralised. Thus the expression includes compounds sometimes called sulphobetais or sultaines. Quaternary ammonium compound as used herein excludes internally neutralised compounds.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF E lBODIMENTS The nreferred betaines may be represented by the following formula EMI4.1 where R1 is alkyl or alkenyl of 8 20 carbon atoms which may be saturated or unsaturated, may be interrupted by heteroatoms or groups such as O , COO or CONH and may have one or more hydroxy substituents,R2 and R3 are alkyl residues of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R4 is an alkylene residue of 1 to 3 carbon atoms and X is COO, SO3, or OSO3. R1 may also includeEMI4.2 groups as described in British patent specificationsNos. 1,274,005 and 1,291,424, although this is not preferred. R5 is alkyl of 8 to 24, preferably 10 to 18 carbon atoms. Preferably R1 has 12 to 18 carbon atoms and R2 and R3 are methyl. The preferred betaines are those described in British patent specification No. 1,08 4,739, i.e. those in the formula above in which represents a hydrophobic group which is an alkyl or alkenyl group having from 8 18 carbon atoms, for example a dodecyl, tridl, myristyl, cetyl, stearyl, 2 mythylpentadecyl group or an alkyl phenyl group possessing an alkyl substituent having from 6 to 16 carbon atoms, for example a p octylphenyl, p nonylphenyl or p dodecylphenyl group.Preferably R1 represents a lauryl and or myristyl group, which may be derived from an alcohol which has been obtained by reduction of the mixture of fatty acids or their derivatives obtained from coconut oil and may be a whole cut, middlecut or narrow cut distillate fraction middlecut coconut alcohol comprises at least 50 per cent by weight of dodecyl alcohol and narrowcut coconut oil at least 70 per cent by weight. R2 and R3 are preferably methyl but may be ethyl or 2 hydroxyethyl or 2 hydroxypropyl. Preferably R4 is methylene but alternatives are ethylene, 2 hydroxyethylene and 2 hydroxypropylene. The group X is preferably a carboxy group. The betaine employed in the preferred embodiment to be described is that sold under the trade mark EMPIGEN BB which can be represented by the formula above in which R2 and R3 are methyl, R4 is methylene,X is carboxyl and R1 is predominantly lauryl myristyl C12 C14 . This is normally sold as a 30 per cent by weight solution in deionised water, containing 0.5 per cent of free amine and having a pH of 8.It has extremely mild detergent action and is non irritant. The following are alternative betaines within the general formula above lauryl dimethyl carboxymethyl betaine lauryl dimethyl alpha carboxyethyl betaine cetyl dimethyl carboxymethyl betaine lauryl bis 2 hydroxyethyl carboxymethyl betaine lauryl bis 2 hydroxyethyl betasulphatoethyl betaine, lauryl dimethyl beta sulphatoethyl betaine stearyl bis 2 hydroxypropyl carboxymethyl betaine cetyl bis 2 hydroxyethyl beta sulphatopropyl betaine olelyl dimethyl gammacarboxypropyl betaine and lauryl bis 2 hydroxypropyl alpha carbosyethyl betaine, 1 myristyl dimethylammonio propane 3 sulphonate and 1 myristyl dimethylammonio 2 hydroxypropane 3 sulphonate and the coconut oil derived alkyl dimethyl betaine and the alkyl amidopropyl dimethyl betaine detergents in which the alkyl group contains 3a Cg, 7 C10 48t C12, 18 C14, 9 16 and 10 C The composition of the invention preferably also includes a proportion of a quaternary ammonium compound which should be of the type which is cosmetically acceptable e.g. in soaps, creams and the like and which have anti microbial properties. The quaternary ammonium compound is utilised to stabilise the composition against deterioration. However it is also useful for its detergent properties and softening effect upon the hair, and for its antistatic properties. Many suitable quaternary ammonium compounds are known and are used in shampoos and soaps, e.g. in the earlier British patents above disclosed, especially 1,355,233 and also 1,029,043. The preferred compound is cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide which is sold under the trade mark Cetrimide. The quaternary ammonium compound may be employed in amount by weight of 0.05 to 5 per cent of the composition, preferably about 2 per cent. The composition may be in the form of a shaving soap, a lather cream, or a brushless cream, in its broad aspect. llowever, I haao developed, in accordance with an important preferred aspect of the invention, a novel composition in the form of a substantially transparent gel. This gel is especially effective for the following reasons. It can be applied in small quantities, e.g. about lml to the moistened face directly with the hand. It provides a lubricant to the razor, giving a smooth action, and it allows the stubble to be viewed during the shaving operation, which is impossible with lathers and creams. It is not normally necessary to shave more than once but the gel can in any case be redistributed b a second gentle rub with the hand if a second shave is necessary. The whole operation is extremely rapid and the face left in a smooth and soft condition. The preferred gel can be based upon colloidal dispersing agents or gelling agents such as hydroxyethyl cellulose. The preferred gelling agents are those sold under the trade mark Tylose H. As sold, these are odourless and neutral. They have a cellulose ether content of about 93 , about 5 moisture as supplied about 2 residual sodium acetate, about 2 molar substitution, about 35 average OC2fiI4 content and a specific gravity of 1.4. Thermal decomposition begins at about 2000C. The preferred ingredientTylose H 4000 has an average molecular weight of 190,000 and a viscosity Hoeppler viscosity of 2 per cent solution at 200C of 3000 to 5000 cP. The Tylose is preferably employed in dilute aqueous solution, e.g. 2.5 by weight. This solution may constitute about 95 by weight of the composition and may vary e.g. between 80 to 98 per cent.The solution concentration may vary from e.g. 1 to 4 by weight. Preferably there is also included in the gel a small quantity e.g. about 2.5 by weight or generally from 1 to 3 per cent of an oil. The preferred oil is that sold under the trade make Pur Cellin Soluble.This is a soluble form of oil derived from the plummage grease of water fowl. Chemically the base oil is an alkyl branched fatty acid ester with a low solidification point around Ooh . This material is absorbed by the skin, leaving it soft and moist. The invention is hereafter further described with reference to certain non limitation examples.Example 1 The following example gives a preferred formulation of shaving gel in accordance with the invention.

Per Cent by l eio t Cetyl stearyl alcohol 15 Empigen BB 30 solution 10 Glycerol or sorbitol 15 Pur Cellin Oil 58 Perfumes as desired Water balance In general the cetyl stearyl alcohol can be replaced by any suitable emulsifying wax including commercial brands of selfemulsifying wax within the broad limits of 1 to 15 . The betaine can be any suitable betaine as already described within the broad limits described, but a larger minim amount will be necessary where non selfemulsifying waxes are used. The glycerol or sorbitol can be very broadly between 5 to 2G. The Pur Cellin oil can be replaced byPur Cellin Soluble and either of these can vary from 1 to 10 . Furthermore, a quaternary ammonium compound may be added to replace part of the betaine, but preferably not more than half the betaine by weight, should be so replaced. Example 4 In order to prepare a lather shaving cream, the receipe of Example 4 can be used with the replacement of the glycerol or sorbitol by coconut oildiethanolamide. In order to prepare a solid shaving soap, a conventional toilet soap formulation may be used containing up to 108 by weight of betaine. Part of the betaine may be replaced by a quaternary ammonium compound but the total of the mixture should preferably not exceed 102 by weight, and there is preferably not less than 18 and not ore than 5 of such a quaternary ammonium compound.
