# IMPROVED SOLAR GENERATOR MOUNTING STRUCTURE

## Abstract
A solar generator support structure for housing standard photovoltaic panels is disclosed. The solar panels are housed in flat planes bays and courses which include a plurality of parallel, symmetrically faceted and stepped areas that are a maximum at the base and over the center of the support structure and which planes define a dome shaped segment called a hemidome. The flat planes face upwardly at a compromise sun angle, and those planes are driven, either by single or double axis tracking, so that they follow the sun s movements.
