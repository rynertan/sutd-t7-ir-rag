# Process, reagent and kit for the assay of total bilirubin.

## Abstract
An improved reagent and method for assay of total bilirubin in biological fluids utilizes diazo sulfanilic acid to convert bilirubin to azobilirubin which is then quantitatively measured. The improved reagent and method include the solvent accelerator tetramethylene sulfone. The use of tetramethylene sulfone allows for the use of nonionic surfactants, obviating the need for serum blank correction in highly lipemic serum. Furthermore, the use of tet ramethylene sulfone and nonionic surfactants renders the reagent mixture less viscous facilitating automated analysis.
