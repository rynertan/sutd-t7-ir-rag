# Sequence controller.

## Abstract
In processing a sequence program for a b contact, an input signal is logically inverted ultimately, and the process ing for the b contact requires logical inversion processing which is not involved in processing an a contact. A logical inversion circuit 8 is provided for logically inverting an input signal corresponding to b contact designation of the sequence program before the input signal is fed to a central processing unit 3 , so that inversion processing in the cen tral processing unit can be dispensed with and operation speed can be increased. The application of a logical inver sion signal to the logical inversion circuit can readily be effected by utilizing an address line of the central process ing unit.
