# Hydroformylation of olefins.

## Abstract
The higher alcohol yield of a hydroformylation process including hydroformylation, catalyst removal, hydrogena tion and higher alcohol separation stages is improved by subjecting the Heavy Oxo Fraction HOF obtained following higher alcohol separation to steam cracking in the presence of a catalyst system comprising a dehydration catalytic metal on an acidic support. The resultant cracked HOF mixture comprising a major proportion of olefin and satu rated hydrocarbon is recycled to the hydroformylation stage.
