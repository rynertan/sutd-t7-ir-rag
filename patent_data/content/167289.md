# TRANSPARENCY APPARATUS

## Abstract
A transparency apparatus has a generally rectangular tabular light guide plate 1 having a flat upper surface 11 , the underside of the light guide plate having at least one tapered surface 15,16 which extends from near a light receiving end surface 13,14 of the light guide plate such as to progressively approach the flat upper surface of the light guide plate. The tapered surface is provided with fine convexities and concavities. The portion 17 of the upper surface opposing the tapered surface presents an area on which an observation plate is to be seated and the trans parency can be placed on the observation plate.
