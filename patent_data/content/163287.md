# IMPROVED INCONTINENT GARMENT, CATAMENIAL DEVICE OR WOUND DRESSING

## Abstract
The invention relates to a pad that has as the outer impervious layer a polymer sheet integrally bonded to a fabric material such that the fabric material is on the exterior of the polymer sheet. The fabric is exposed on the body side of the pad when the edges of the pad are wrapped with the impervious liner to form baffles. The absorbent material forming the inner portion of the pad is integrally connected to a pervious body side liner material. The connection of pervious liner to absorbent is such that when the pad is manipulated the pervious liner material stays in contact with the absorbent material and aids in transfer of liquid through the pervious liner into the absorbent. The fabric forming part of the impervious layer is preferably hydrophobic.
