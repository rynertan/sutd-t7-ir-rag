# Bowden cable arrangement.

## Abstract
A push pull cable arrangement for selectively transmit ting longitudinal motion to two separate destinations has an inner wire 6 having a front end 6a , a rear end 6b and an intermediate node 19 between the front and rear ends. The inner wire 6 is enclosed with a first outer casing 9 between the front end 6a and the intermediate node 19 , and with a second outer casing 13 between the inter mediate node 19 and the rear end 13b . A front end 9a of the first casing 9 facing the front end 9a of the wire 6 is stationary, and a rear end 13b of the seond casing 13 facing the rear end 9b of the inner wire 6 is also station ary. There is further provided an intermediate unit 33 having a first member 15 or 16 to which a rear end 9b of the first casing 9 is fixed, and a second member to which a front end 13a of the second casing 13 is fixed. One of the first and second members is a stationary housing 15 , and the other is a sliding member 16 slidably contained in the housing 15 . The housing 15 and the sliding member 16 receives the inner wire 6 with the intermediate node 19 slidably, and the sliding member 16 is movable lon gitudinally of the wire in the housing.
