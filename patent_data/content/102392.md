# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MANUFACTURING SHEETLIKE FORMING MATERIAL.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for manufacturing a sheetlike forming material to produce a fiber reinforced plastic, and a method for manufacturing a simple and inexpensive sheet like forming material by eliminating the drawbacks of the conventional winding stage and an apparatus for performing the same. This method includes the steps of driving an endless flat belt 11 in a loop, bending and guiding the flat belt into a longitudinal cylindrical shape along a predeter mined route, inserting the cylindrical part of the flat belt into a winding drum and a winding disc arranged coaxially so as to move relative to them, guiding a carrier film 4 and warp wires 30 along the cylindrical part, inserting a weft wire 20 through a guide hole formed in the disc to rotate the disc as the cylindrical part is moved in a predetermined direction, thereby winding the weft wire onto the cylindrical part while winding the weft wire onto the drum, supplying synthetic resin to the warp or weft wire at the inlet or outlet side of the disc, and continuously cutting the weft wire at the down stream side end 6 of the cylindrical part to form a flat material.
