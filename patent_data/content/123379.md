# Gasketing for heat exchanger plates.

## Abstract
A gasket retention for heat exchanger plates in which a projection on the gasket passes through apertures in the plate. These apertures are made so as to provide two alterna tive positions for the gasket projections 3 , namely a tight position as illustrated in Figure 1c and a freely movable position. The movement between positions may be by twist ing as in Figure 1c , or by a longitudinal movement, e.g. in a key hole slot aperture. The apertures may be tapered through the plates.
