## Description
METHOD AND TEST KIT FOR DETERMINATION OF ALKALINITY IN OILS The invention relates to a method and apparatus for determining the total base number alkalinity of oil. The apparatus is in the form of a kit containing vials of component liquids which can be admixed with an oil sample for alkalinity determinations. Under conditions of actual use oil s , such as those used for lubrication, no matter how well inhibited they may be, will tend to accumulate acid oxidation products over time. As long as bases from the additives in the oil are sufficient to neutralize these acids, such acids are not detrimental to the part or parts being protected. However, when the protective bases are used up by the acids, the oil must be removed or diluted with fresh oil or irreparable damage may occur to lubricated parts. One of the most vexing problems in this area, particularly for commercial operators, has been knowing when an oil has reached its limit of practical usefulness. In the laboratory, a determination of the alkalinity condition of an oil sample is not especially difficult, because elaborate equipment can be used to carry out sophisticated analytical procedures.Obviously, however, such equipment and procedures are impractical in the field. In marine shipping, for example, the expense of placing the needed equipment and the personnel to operate it on ship is prohibitive. Thus, a great deal of effort has been expended to discover a rapid and inexpensive method for estimating the amount of basicity present in an oil sample. The present invention has been designed to minimize some of the practical problems associated with known oil alkalinity testing methods and apparatus. The invention provides an easy and safe method and test kit apparatus for determining alkalinity in terms of the total base number of the tested oil. According to the present invention, a method is provided for colorimetrically determining the alkalinity, as total base number, of an oil comprising the steps of mixing an oil sample with an indicator solution to form an oil phase, titrating the oil phase with an aqueous mineral acid solution to form an aqueous phase above the oil phase and determining alkalinity in terms of total base number TBN by the number of units of mineral acid solution introduced into said oil phase, each of which corresponds to a predetermined base number, required to convert the aqueous layet from a color indicating a basic aqueous layer to a color indicating a neutral aqueous layer. The indicator solution is non toxic, resistant to the effects of aromatics and water, and is soluble in oil. The oil and indicator solution are soluble in one another to form an oil phase.The combination of alcohol and at least one halohydrocarbon with the oil sample improves contact and ion exchange between the oil phase and the aqueous phase, while maintaining an oil phase density greater than that of the aqueous phase. The apparatus of the invention employs a test kit for determining alkalinity in terms of total base s number of an oil, comprising a first receptacle adapted to admit a volume of oil thereto a predetermined volume of indicator solution containing a colorimetric indicator, at least one halohydrocarbon, and an aliphatic monohydric alcohol means for dispensing a volume of the oil into the first receptacle, for mixing therein with said predetermined volume of indicator solution a second receptacle containing an aqueous mineral acid solution and means for adding a portion of said aqueous mineral acid solution from said second receptacle to said first receptacle to form an aqueous phase above said oil phase. In both the method and apparatus, the degree of oil alkalinity in terms of total base number is indicated by the volume of aqueous mineral acid solution which must be added to convert the color indicator from a basic indicating color to a neutral indicating color.Since each predetermined unit of aqueous mineral acid solution represents a predetermined base number, the total base number is indicated by multiplication of the number of volume units by the base number per unit volume. Fig. 1 illustrates a syringe for dispensing a volume of sample oil which forms part of the test kit of the invention Fig. 2 illustrates a mixing receptacle which forms part of the test kit of the invention in an open position Fig. 3 illustrates the first receptacle in a closed mixing position and, Fig. 4 illustrates preferred embodiments of a second receptacle which forms part of the test kit of the invention and which is used for dispensing a solution into the first receptacle. As noted, the present invention provides a simple, easy to use method for testing for oil alkalinity as represented by a total base number TBN .TBN is defined as mg KOH gm of an oil sample. The method is preferably implemented with a test kit which contains vials of indicator and mineral acid solutions which can be admixed with an oil sample to provide a colorimetric indication of oil alkalinity. It is an essential feature of the invention that the indicator solution be soluble with an oil sample to form an oil phase. The indicator solution comprises an aliphatic monohydric alcohol, at least one liquid halohydrocarbon that is heavier than water and a colorimetric indicator. The halohydrocarbon produces an oil phase which is denser than water. The alcohol promotes mixing of halohydrocarbon, oil sample and aqueous mineral acid. Both the halohydrocarbon and alcohol are non toxic. Any of the aliphatic monohydric alcohols from methanol through about C6 alcohols would produce satisfactory solution forming results, however the preferred alcohol for the indicator solution is a butanol, with l butanol being particularly pteferred.Methanol would be toxic and isopropyl alcohol does not work as well as l butanol. The preferred halohydrocarbon is 1,1,2 trichlorotrifluoroethane freon . A problem in the prior art is the adverse affect on previous alkalinity determining methods of water in the oils. The method of the present invention is applicable to oils containing water, because the oil phase is titrated with the aqueous mineral acid solution. In general aspects, the method and apparatus are applicable to any oil, whether it be of mineral or synthetic origin, or special purpose oils such as marine oil. The synthetic lubricating oil may be an ester oil, including one prepared from polyhydric alcohol and a monocarboxylic acid or a polycarboxylic acid and a monohydric alcohol. It may also be a synthetic hydrocarbon from olefin polymerization, or a polysiloxane or the like. Before describing the method aspects of the present invention in detail, a preferred test kit which assists in implementing the method will be described with reference to Figs. 1 4. The test kit comprises a syringe 20 Fig. 1 for dispensing a sample of oil.Syringe 20 has sidewalls 22 and a plunger 26 which passes through syringe top 28. Oil may be drawn into the syringe 20 through nozzle 24 and is dispensed therefrom. The sidewalls 22 may be provided with lines 25 to mark off predetermined liquid volumes. The test kit further comprises a 15 ml first mixing receptacle 30 Fig. 2 adapted to be opened and closed on one end 36 thereof. The first receptacle 30 has sidewalls 32, screw lid 34, an opening 36 and may be precharged with a premeasured amount, e.g. 3.5 ml, of an indicator solution 38. Alternatively, the indicator solution may be provided in a separate container and placed in mixing receptacle 30 when an alkalinity test is to be performed. Fig. 3 shows the first receptacle 30 in a closed position. The indicator solution 38 comprises a mixture of at least one halohydrocarbon, an aliphatic monohydric alcohol and a colorimetric indicator. The halohydrocarbon and alcohol are used because they. are soluble in oil. The alcohol may be one of the aliphatic monohydric r C1 C6 alcohols however, a butanol and particularly l butanol is preferred because it has low toxicity, as noted, and, when combined with a halohydrocarbon, promotes the mixing of the halohydrocarbon, oil sample and aqueous mineral acid.The halohydrocarbon is preferably 1,1,2 trichlorotrifluoroethane freon because it is a dense liquid which, in combination with 1 butanol, is soluble with oil to form an oil phase while maintaining an oil phase density greater than that of water. The preferred range of compositions of indicator solution 38 in the oil phase is, for each part by volume of oil, from about 0.7 to about 4 parts by volume of halohydrocarbon and from about 0.2 to about 1.0 parts by volume of alcohol. The freon also thins out the oil to reduce viscosity, and improves contact and ion exchange between the oil phase and an aqueous phase described below . The particularly preferred ratio by volume of butanol to freon in the indicator solution 38 is 6 parts freon to 1 part butanol, although other ratios can also be used. The colorimetric indicator employed in solution 38 has a PKa in the range of about 3.4 6. Suitable colorimetric indicators include bromocresol green, methyl orange, methyl red or a combination of bromocresol green and methyl red. Bromocresol green is preferred because it has an unexpectedly strong color change, namely an intense blue color in basic solutions, and permits a determination of the total base number TBN within one TBN unit. The concentration of the colorimetric indicator resides in the range of 0.002 0.08 wt. of the indicator solution. Bromocresol green is blue in basic solutions, green in neutral solutions and yellow in acidic solutions. The test kit further comprises at least one second receptacle 40 containing a premeasured amount of aqueous mineral acid solution 49. Since it may be desirable to conduct tests with different volumes of aqueous mineral acid solution, more than one receptacle 40 may be provided with the test kit each containing a different liquid volume. Two such receptacles 42, 44 respectively precharged with 1 ml and 2 ml of aqueous mineral acid solution are shown in Fig. 4. Other sizes are also provided. To protect a person using the kit from, the aqueous mineral acid solution 49, each second receptacle 40 is preferably formed as a plastic enclosed pillow having a body portion 46 and a nipple portion 48. The second receptacle 40 is easily opened by cutting the end of nipple portion 48 thereby permitting the aqueous mineral acid solution 49 to be squeezed out of the receptacle 40. The aqueous mineral acid 49 could be any strong acid, such as HC1, H2S04 or paratoluenesulfonic acid. The preferred acid is hydrochloric acid. To also protect a person using the kit, the acid concentration ranges from about 0.06 normal 0.3 normal which is only moderately toxic. Each second receptacle 40 contains an amount of aqueous mineral acid to equal one, or a multiple of one, total base number TBN unit relative to the oil. Broadly, the method of invention is practiced in the following manner. A predetermined amount of indicator solution 38, e.g. 3.5 ml, is placed in a first receptacle 30. A sample of the oil to be tested, preferably at about 150 50OC, is removed from a source not shown by syringe 20 through nozzle 24, and placed in first receptacle 30 where it contacts with indicator solution 38. The first receptacle 30 is then closed by screw lid 34 and is shaken to mix the oil and indicator solution 38 to form an oil phase. Then the first receptacle is opened and one unit volume of the aqueous mineral acid is introduced therein and the receptacle is shaken. However, the shaking is gentle to facilitate subsequent formation of an aqueous phase above the oil phase. Then the contents of the first receptacle 30 are allowed to settle and the aqueous phase is observed for color.If the aqueous phase is blue, the oil sample is basic, therefor it is necessary to determine the TBN of the oil sample, so the oil phase is titrated by adding an additional unit volume of aqueous mineral acid. This process of adding a unit of aqueous mineral acid solution and observing the resulting color of the aqueous phase is repeated until the aqueous phase turns green indicating the presence of a neutral aqueous phase. The total base number of the oil is determined by multiplying the number of unit volumes of mineral acid solution required for the color change by the base number which each unit volume represents. For example, if a unit volume of mineral acid solution represents a base number of 1 relative to a given volume of an oil sample, and ten unit volumes are required for a color change to green, the total base number of the tested oil would be 10. The acid strength of the aqueous mineral acid solution 49 ranges from 0.06 0.3 normal and the volume of aqueous mineral acid solution 49 in each second receptacle 40 is such that each second receptacle 40 contains enough aqueous mineral acid solution 49 to equal one unit of total base number TBN or a multiple of one unit of TBN relative to the oil sample. Each second receptacle 40 is preferably labeled with the number of units of TBN per its volume contents so theTBN of the oil sample, which is the sum of the units ofTBN of the aqueous mineral acid solution added, can be easily determined. Typically fresh oil has a TBN ranging from 0 70 units. The useful TBN range for oil depends on the application in which the oil is used. The following is an example of how the test kit can be used to implement the method of the invention a a 2 milliliter sample of oil at room temperature or slightly warmer 150 500C is obtained with syringe 20 b the oil is dispensed into the first receptacle 30 containing 3 1 2 ml of a 6 1 volume ratio, 1,1,2 trichlorotrifluoroethane, l butanol indicator solution 38 containing .02 wt. bromocresol green c the screw lid 34 of the first receptacle 30 is closed and receptacle 30 is shaken to form an oil phase d the screw lid 34 is removed from the first receptacle 30, and the nipple 48 from the body portion 46 of a second receptacle 40 containing a volume of aqueous mineral acid solution 49 is clipped after which titration of the oil phase is started by adding one unit of aqueous mineral acid solution 49 from the second receptacle 40 to the first receptacle 30 e the aqueous phase on top of the oil phase is gently rocked and an observation of the color of the aqueous phase is made if the color is not easily discernible, the contents of receptacle 30 are allowed to settle for several minutes, e.g. 3, into more clearly distinct phases f If the color is green indicating a neutral solution , the TBN is the units of TBN as labeled on the second receptacle 40 for the one unit of volume dispensed into receptacle 30 g If the color is yellow indicating an acidic solution , a new oil sample is tested and a second receptacle 40, containing an aqueous mineral acid solution having fewer TBN units per unit volume is used h If no separation occurs after a reasonable time e.g. 60 minutes , a new oil sample is tested or i If the color is blue indicating a basic solution , titration is continued, by adding the aqueous mineral acid solution from one or more second receptacles 40 one unit at a time until a green color is observed. j The TBN of the oil sample is the sum of the base number units labeled on each second receptacle 40 for the number of volume units which were used for the titration. That is, the base number per unit volume multiplied by the number of volume units used yields the total base number. If a test kit containing an aqueous mineral acid calculated by base number per unit volume is not employed in the method of the invention, then total base number, when using an aqueous mineral acid solution of known normality, may be calculated as follows, TBN N x 56.1 x V S TBN s mg KOH gm sample N Normality gm equivalent liter 56.1 p Equivalent Weight of KOH, gms gm equivalent V s Volume of titrant, ml S weight of oil sample, gms The following is an example of the calculation of TBN in a case where a 2,0 ml oil sample, having a specific gravity of 0.90, is mixed with 2.5 ml of colorimetric indicator solution and titrated with 10 ml. of a 0.10 N aqueous HC1 solution to achieve a neutral aqueous phase. TBN 0.10 x 56.1 x 10 2.0 X 0.9 31 As is evident from the foregoing, the present invention provides a simple, safe and easy to use method and apparatus for testing the alkalinity of oil.
