# Switched capaciter filter and method of making same.

## Abstract
There ist provided a high pass switched capacitor fil ter having low bandpass ripple. The present filter does not have peaking near its center frequency when sampled at switching frequencies used in communication systems. The high pass filter has three switched capacitor integra tors 10, 25, 40 providing a 3 pole Chebyshev high pass switched capacitor filter. A fourth switched capacitor inte grator 50 is used to provide an output for the filter. A method of implementing the high pass filter from a set of parameter requirements is also provided. The capacitors used in this filter are rations of each other and the filter readily lends itself to being implemented as a monolithic integrated circuit, paricularly as a CMOS circuit.
